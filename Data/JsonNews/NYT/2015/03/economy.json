{"Headline": "ISIS\u00a0Finds New Frontier in Chaotic Libya", "Date": "2015-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySURT, Libya \u2014 The Islamic State has established more than a foothold in this Mediterranean port. Its fighters dominate the city center so thoroughly that a Libyan brigade sent to dislodge the group remains camped on the outskirts, visibly afraid to enter and allowing the extremists to come and go as they please.\u201cWe are going to allow them to slip out, because the less people we have to fight, the better,\u201d said Mohamed Omar el-Hassan, a 28-year-old former crane operator who leads the brigade from a prefabricated shed on a highway ringing the city.\u201cWhy make the city suffer?\u201d he said, trying to explain his delay more than 16 days after the brigade arrived in Surt.That close cooperation so far sets the Islamic State group in Surt apart from the wave of other militants who have pledged allegiance to ISIS from Afghanistan, Algeria, Nigeria and Egypt, or even in Libya\u2019s southern and eastern provinces.But even after the international uproar over the video, no Libyan authority has been able to take any effective action against the group. Two warring coalitions of militias have divided the country, and each \u2014 including the one that sent Mr. Hassan and his fighters, known as Brigade 166 \u2014 appears more intent on fighting the other than on thwarting the Islamic State. What is more, the battles have crippled Libya\u2019s oil exports so severely that there is now a risk that the country\u2019s currency and economy will soon collapse.\u201cA currency collapse is less than two years away,\u201d Musbah Alkari, manager of the reserves department at the Central Bank of Libya, said in an interview at the bank\u2019s headquarters in Tripoli.Western governments are keeping a watchful eye. Fighters with Mr. Hassan\u2019s brigade at the edge of Surt pointed to what appeared to be a white surveillance drone or airplane circling overhead \u2014 a daily visitor, they said.His fighters used extreme caution when circling the city. Escorting a Western journalist on a brief visit, they were careful not to enter the city itself. To reach one point on the outskirts, Mr. Hassan brought a half-dozen trucks for protection, some mounted with artillery, and his fighters kept their guns elevated on constant alert.His brigade had established control of the airport, Mr. Hassan said. But there were no signs that the fighters had set up checkpoints, even at critical spots like the coastal road entering the city or the main road to the airport. \u201cSee the jihad,\u201d read graffiti on a wall along the main road outside the city.The Islamic State controls the local radio station; during the recent visit, all four stations on the dial were transmitting Islamic sermons. \u201cThey use the radio stations to broadcast, and they are attracting a lot of people to join them,\u201d Mr. Hassan said wearily.He and other local militia leaders, citing informants inside Surt, said they believed that the Islamic State fighters in the city numbered about 200 or fewer, while Mr. Hassan\u2019s brigade can command hundreds. He insisted he needed no reinforcements. But the Islamic State fighters were deeply entrenched and stronger than expected, Mr. Hassan said.\u201cWe came here with orders to go in and take over the city, but we were surprised by the numbers that joined them,\u201d he said.Since arriving, his brigade had found time to apprehend some foreign workers without visas trying to move through the area, Mr. Hassan said.The rival militia coalition, based in the eastern cities of Tobruk and Bayda and under the loose command of Gen. Khalifa Hifter, describes itself as fighting to rescue Libya from Islamic extremists, including the Islamic State fighters. \u201cLibya was becoming the funding house, and they were going to export terrorism around the world,\u201d said Saqr al-Jaroushi, the air force chief under General Hifter.But the coalition\u2019s leaders often characterize all of its opponents as extremists, including regional militias like Mr. Hassan\u2019s. Brigade 166 fighters displayed some evidence that General Hifter\u2019s coalition had been bombing their positions outside the city, even though in this case Mr. Hassan\u2019s brigade is on a mission against the same extremists.The coalition that sent Mr. Hassan, which is known as Libya Dawn and opposes General Hifter, includes some Islamic extremist groups in the eastern cities of Benghazi, Darnah and possibly elsewhere. Its supporters often try to argue that the Islamic State fighters in Surt are merely a front for Qaddafi loyalists or supporters of General Hifter.\u201cA lot of people who have joined this group we call the Islamic State are actually remnants of the previous regime we fought in 2011,\u201d Omar al-Hassi, prime minister of a provisional government set up by the Libya Dawn coalition in Tripoli, said in an interview here. Mr. Hassi dismissed the images of beheadings in Surt as \u201ca fabricated Hollywood-like video\u201d concocted to stir trouble with Egypt.Like many in his coalition, he mentioned a television interview with an influential Qaddafi cousin outside Libya, Ahmed Qaddaf al-Dam, who at times applauded the Islamic State from an Arab nationalist perspective for seeking to erase the border between Syria and Iraq. But Mr. Dam also denounced the group\u2019s medieval Islamist ideology, saying it \u201cshows the psychological state they are in and that they need mental health treatment.\u201dMr. Hassan of Brigade 166, which comes primarily from Misurata, said that history was one reason that his forces hesitated to move in. He said he feared that aggressive military action against the Islamic State could increase its support from local tribes who still resent Misurata\u2019s militias for the destruction of their city in 2011.\u201cIf we went in with both guns blazing, we would have a backlash,\u201d Mr. Hassan said.He and other militia leaders also acknowledged, though, that the core of the Islamic State in Surt was from Misurata \u2014 a connection that could test the loyalties of other Misuratan militiamen, who are typically reluctant to fight against their neighbors or cousins.After Misuratan brigades moved into Surt in 2011, Mr. Hassan and others acknowledged, some continued to occupy the city and eventually turned into an extremist group, Ansar al-Shariah of Surt, a parallel to organizations of the same name in Benghazi and Derna.More than two months ago, Mr. Hassan and others said, Ansar al-Shariah of Surt split up in a dispute over pledging allegiance to the Islamic State, and those who chose to ally with it emerged as the dominant faction. \u201cThey are the nucleus,\u201d Mr. Hassan said.\u201cYou can say that the leaders are from Misurata,\u201d Mr. Hassan said, although he insisted that would not deter his brigade. \u201cI am not here as a Misuratan.\u201dA fighter named Suliman Ali Mousa, 58, raised the theory that the Islamic State had become merely a \u201cbanner\u201d for criminals or Qaddafi loyalists.But Mr. Hassan said that hardly mattered. \u201cIf they are raising the black flag of the Islamic State and preaching Islamic State ideas,\u201d he said, \u201cthen they are the Islamic State.\u201dSuliman Ali Zway contributed reporting from Surt, and C. J. Chivers from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "S.E.C. Chief Defends Agency\u2019s Handling of Bank Punishment", "Date": "2015-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of Wall Street\u2019s top regulators on Thursday shot back at criticism that the nation\u2019s biggest banks enjoy special treatment in Washington, delivering a sweeping defense of the government while also rebuking the financial industry\u2019s \u201crepeated and disturbing violations of law.\u201dThe debate centers on criticism \u2014 from Congressional Democrats and even some of the S.E.C.\u2019s own commissioners \u2014 that the agency routinely provided banks valuable \u201cwaivers\u201d from so-called bad actor bans that arose when a bank settled an S.E.C. case or pleaded guilty to a crime. The waivers, critics say, offer a free pass from bans that would disqualify banks from most private offerings of securities.At the heart of Ms. White\u2019s rebuttal was previously unreleased data suggesting that her agency did not simply rubber stamp Wall Street\u2019s requests for waivers. The data, she said, shows that the S.E.C. rejected 14 \u201cbad actor\u201d waiver requests and granted 13 over the last year and a half.\u201cSome have said that the commission and its staff routinely grant waivers without rigorous analysis,\u201d she said, a veiled reference to some of her colleagues at the S.E.C. \u201cThat is simply not true.\u201dMs. White\u2019s speech represents her fullest rebuttal of criticism that her agency has adopted a light touch with Wall Street, a concern that traces to the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The speech also provided a long-awaited moment for Ms. White, who joined the agency two years ago next month with the reputation as a tough-on-crime former federal prosecutor, to stem the rising wave of doubt about the S.E.C.\u2019s waiver policy.The waiver issue has become an unlikely cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for consumer advocates and liberal lawmakers, and one that has divided the S.E.C.\u2019s five commissioners. The commission\u2019s liberal wing has been pitted against the agency\u2019s two Republican commissioners, creating a conundrum for Ms. White, a political independent and the deciding fifth vote.Simmering for a while, tension erupted last month over the handling of Oppenheimer & Company, which settled a case that set off a bad actor ban. Despite a pattern of recidivism at Oppenheimer \u2014 with at least 30 regulatory actions over the last decade \u2014 the S.E.C. granted the company a waiver.In her speech, Ms. White detailed her own approach to the issue, striking a balance between the populist uproar over waivers and the cases in which they might be warranted.\u201cThese are important provisions that enable the commission to safeguard investors and our capital markets from those whom we do not think should be able to fully function in them because of their past misconduct,\u201d Ms. White said.Ms. White emphasized that banks were no more likely to receive a waiver than any other public company, saying, \u201cWe should and do treat large financial institutions exactly the same as any other firm or person when considering whether a waiver is appropriate \u2014 no better, and no worse.\u201dBut Ms. White also outlined the cases in which, at least in her judgment, the S.E.C. should grant the waivers. The rules governing waivers, she noted, allow for exemptions for \u201cgood cause\u201d or in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d Other times, she said, the rules direct the S.E.C. to grant waivers \u201cif the disqualification would be unduly or disproportionately severe.\u201dDoing so, she said, might \u201ctemper the potential over-breadth of the disqualification provisions.\u201dMs. White also drew a distinction between waivers, which are overseen by the agency\u2019s division of corporation finance, and the penalties that the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement division imposes on companies that misbehave. Unlike the penalties, she said, waivers were \u201cnever intended to be, and we should not use them as, an additional enforcement tool designed to address misconduct.\u201dIn defending her agency\u2019s approach to punishing Wall Street, Ms. White finds herself in an unexpected position. As the former United States attorney in Manhattan \u2014 a role in which she prosecuted banks and financial frauds \u2014 she sailed through Senate confirmation with little concern.Now, in articulating her agency\u2019s enforcement agenda, she is leaning on her prosecutorial past.\u201cWe have seen repeated and disturbing violations of law by major financial institutions, both before and after the financial crisis,\u201d she said. And the debate over waivers, she added, \u201cshould never obscure or distract from our overall commitment to rigorous enforcement.\u201dMs. White also addressed concerns that Wall Street, by nature of its size and importance to the economy, avoids meaningful punishment.\u201cOne series of questions that has been raised in the dialogue is whether financial institutions that are potentially subject to disqualifications are too big to indict or otherwise charge, too big to jail, or even too big to bar. My answer to all of these and similar questions is a resounding, \u2018No.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeb Bush May Be One Bush Too Many for Rank-and-File Iowa G.O.P. ", "Date": "2015-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother activist, John Thompson, a West Point graduate who served in Iraq, called it \u201ca wasted war.\u201d Jeb Bush, he said, was the last of the potential Republican candidates he would consider.This is the paradox of Mr. Bush\u2019s early campaign: He is well out in front in the race for elite Republican donors and for the support of the party\u2019s establishment. But he is unpopular with many in the rank and file, who can pick from a large crop of younger White House contenders who pass the conservative litmus tests that Mr. Bush fails.Mr. Bush will have a chance to break through that grass-roots resistance on Friday, when he arrives for his first visit to Iowa in more than three years.Far from the offices of Washington lobbyists and the private homes where he has romanced affluent donors for months, Mr. Bush\u2019s two-day trip includes stops at a Waukee barbecue joint and a Cedar Rapids pizza place. It is part of the first retail campaign swing by Mr. Bush in early-voting states, and he will follow it up with visits to New Hampshire and South Carolina in the coming weeks.His strategists say Mr. Bush plans to tell Iowans that he is a \u201creform-minded conservative\u201d with a record of results and a vision for overcoming stagnating incomes and tax reform.Yet Mr. Bush appears so far to be bypassing the extensive networks of supporters, and strategists, that his father and older brother each built in Iowa en route to winning its first-in-the-nation caucus.On Monday, Mr. Bush named an outsider to head up his prospective Iowa campaign: Annie Kelly, a Pennsylvania native who worked for the National Republican Congressional Committee. And veterans of the \u201cBush Brigade,\u201d a group of up to 300 activists who met annually during the 1980s, said they had not heard from Jeb Bush.Of course, Mr. Bush\u2019s campaign is just getting going in Iowa; one Bush strategist said it would enlist elements of the old guard before long. But it is unclear how many, if called, would rally behind Mr. Bush.\u201cHe\u2019s at a different point in history than his brother George was,\u201d said George W. Wittgraf, a lawyer in Cherokee, Iowa, who was state chairman for the first President Bush. \u201cPeople were looking for an alternative to Bill Clinton then. While they\u2019re looking for an alternative to Barack Obama, there are lots of other potential candidates.\u201dRalph R. Brown, who worked for both earlier Bush candidacies in the state, said Mr. Bush was wise to seek out a fresh team in Iowa. \u201cThere will be a new generation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it takes to win.\u201dAlthough Mr. Bush has said he wants to be his \u201cown man,\u201d he is inescapably in his family\u2019s shadow. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of the same old same old,\u201d said Kellie Paschke, a lawyer in Waukee and a Republican activist in Dallas County west of Des Moines. Mr. Bush\u2019s \u201cname is something he\u2019s going to have to overcome,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is going to have to be more articulate with his fresh ideas.\u201dOn Friday, Mr. Bush plans to meet privately with potential volunteers and staff at Jethro\u2019s, a barbecue restaurant in Waukee. On Saturday he will appear with a dozen other 2016 hopefuls at an agriculture forum in Des Moines, then attend a meet-and-greet at a Pizza Ranch restaurant in Cedar Rapids \u2014 the city where George W. Bush first publicly declared his ambition to reach the White House, in 1999.Jeb Bush\u2019s own memories of Iowa include some that are less rosy. On the night of the statewide caucus in 1988, he spoke in Council Bluffs in support of his father, who ended up losing the precinct on his way to finishing third in the state (although he won the nomination and the presidency). \u201cIt was a humbling experience\u201d for the 34-year-old Jeb, said Douglas E. Gross, a Bush family friend. \u201cHe trudges back to the Holiday Inn Express by himself like he doesn\u2019t have a friend in the world.\u201d\u201cWe have litmus tests that Iowans will expect candidates to answer the right way if they\u2019re deemed to be viable candidates, and those litmus tests in many cases are a turnoff in the general election,\u201d said Mitch Hambleton, the Republican treasurer of Dallas County. \u201cWe tend to beat ourselves up in the process.\u201dAlthough Iowa strategists unconnected to Mr. Bush said he would have to work the state hard to win over caucusgoers, it remains unclear that he has decided to do so.A strategist for his campaign promised more trips to Iowa, but declined to say how many. And David Kochel, a top Iowa operative whom Mr. Bush moved to Miami to manage his national campaign, has a record of lowering expectations. Four years ago when he ran Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign in Iowa, Mr. Kochel kept him out of the state until very late. (The strategy worked \u2014 Mr. Romney nearly won the 2012 caucus anyway.)But there is danger in treading lightly in Iowa this cycle.The field is stronger and broader than it was in 2012, Republican strategists say. Although Mr. Bush might be tempted to hedge his bets, to avoid the humiliation of a poor Iowa showing, that could allow others who also appeal to center-right voters, like Mr. Christie, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, to gain ground.\u201cWhat happens in Iowa becomes a reflection of your momentum in the race,\u201d said Mr. Gross, who was an Iowa finance chairman for George W. Bush but is unaffiliated this time.As his rivals seek to persuade the party that they are best suited to win the general election, Mr. Bush will also need to make primary voters forget the past.\u201cAll year the question will be, \u2018Can Bush beat Clinton? Can Walker beat Clinton?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Gross said. \u201cTo answer that question about Jeb Bush, they\u2019re going to have to answer in a way that doesn\u2019t relate to his dad or his brother.\u201dAn article on Friday about Jeb Bush\u2019s struggle to win over Republicans in Iowa misspelled the name of a county in the state. It is Greene County, not Green.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2016 Hopefuls and Wealthy Are Aligned on Inequality", "Date": "2015-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut on the question of whether the government should intervene to solve it, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Paul rejected that approach, and Mr. Rubio appeared to agree with them.When \u201cgovernment takes over the economy,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, \u201cit freezes everything in place. And it exacerbates income inequality.\u201d He proposed lowering taxes and loosening regulations instead.Donald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention.There is, however, one group of Americans with whom the Republican contenders and Mrs. Clinton, the likely Democratic front-runner, are generally in step: the wealthy.The views of the rich on other policies that might reduce inequality followed a similar pattern. A mere 19 percent of the wealthy, versus two-thirds of the general public, said the government should \u201csee to it\u201d that anyone who wants a job can find one. Forty percent of the wealthy, versus 78 percent of the public, said the government should make the minimum wage \u201chigh enough so that no family with a full-time worker falls below the official poverty line.\u201dMore recently, one of Professor Page\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, a Northwestern graduate student named Fiona Chin, has further investigated the subject, conducting interviews with nearly 100 other wealthy Americans across the country. Unlike Professors Page, Seawright and Bartels, whose interviewers typically spent under an hour soliciting their subjects\u2019 views on a range of policy questions, Ms. Chin limited her discussions to inequality and often spoke with her subjects for several hours at a time.They recognize that growing up poor puts workers at a disadvantage but argue that a middle-class background presents no barrier to economic success and that growing up wealthy can even be a liability because it robs people of their incentive to work hard. In general, Ms. Chin has found, the rich regard those who do not succeed in life as \u201cpeople who didn\u2019t take advantage of the education system,\u201d not victims of circumstances beyond their control.Some of Ms. Chin\u2019s subjects noted that their views had changed only after they amassed their riches. \u201cBefore I had much money, I thought there should be 100 percent estate tax on dynastic wealth,\u201d a 33-year-old Silicon Valley engineer told Ms. Chin, who grants her subjects anonymity. \u201cOnce you\u2019re playing the game, it\u2019s game on.\u201dComments like this hint at one of the most intriguing conclusions of the recent avenue of research: Wealth seems to shape people\u2019s views regardless of their age, gender, education, marital status \u2014 or even ideology and political party. \u201cThere is a sense in which wealth seems to trump partisanship,\u201d Professor Page said in an email.And given the attention candidates of all stripes must lavish on wealthy donors, that might explain why even relatively moderate presidential aspirants are reluctant to propose a prominent role for government in reducing inequality.And then there is Mrs. Clinton, who has also largely avoided saying anything that might offend her wealthy supporters.But Mrs. Clinton was vague when it came to solutions. She promoted the public-private partnerships that the Clinton Foundation was brokering to expand worker training and noted that her husband\u2019s administration had ushered in \u201cbroad-based growth and shared prosperity\u201d through increasing the minimum wage and doubling the earned-income tax credit.Though she derided the Republican practice of cutting taxes on the wealthy, she made no mention of tax increases or more aggressive measures, like capping the pay of chief executives or modestly taxing stock market transactions.Asked whether those hard choices she referred to were tax increases, a Clinton spokesman said he was not sure.None of this surprises Professor Page. \u201cIt seems clear that wealthy Americans play a big part in shaping policy discussions and policy itself, from taxes to regulation to social welfare policies,\u201d he said. \u201cDefinitely, they affect what candidates can say.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Deadline for Greece, and U.S. Jobs Data", "Date": "2015-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Week AheadHere are some of the top business stories to pay attention to in the coming week.Greece hopes to gain approval on Monday for a detailed list of economic changes that its international creditors have demanded in exchange for the release of sorely needed rescue financing as the country\u2019s cash reserves run perilously low and speculation mounts about a possible default.Representatives of the creditors and the Greek government discussed the list in Brussels over the weekend, before a Monday deadline for its submission. The proposals include measures to increase tax revenue and investment, and would raise some 3 billion euros, about $3.3 billion, according to Greek officials.Reports on the eurozone economy may help to show whether recent green shoots are real. Eurostat on Tuesday will release its unemployment report for February and a first estimate of consumer prices in March.The world\u2019s automakers are preparing for a number of product introductions this week at the annual New York International Auto Show. General Motors plans to show off a broad range of new models, including a large Cadillac sedan and the latest redesign of its top-selling passenger car, the Chevrolet Malibu.How much spring is in the step of auto manufacturers at this week\u2019s auto show might depend on how Wednesday\u2019s monthly sales report tallies up. Industry watchers are split on whether the March sales numbers will land automakers in positive or negative territory compared with a year ago.On Friday, the Labor Department will report the latest data on job creation and unemployment in March. Wall Street is looking for payrolls to have grown by about 250,000, with the unemployment rate unchanged at 5.5 percent. That represents a slight cooling from the state of the labor market in February, when employers added 295,000 jobs and the unemployment rate fell by 0.2 percentage points.But recent economic data has been anemic, and it is likely that hiring has not kept up with the blistering pace of gains reached in late 2014. In fact, some economists say hiring could fall below the 200,000 level because of a combination of bad weather and weakness in certain sectors like drilling and energy production.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Uneasy Coalition for Israel", "Date": "2015-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the Israeli election was above all a referendum on the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he prevailed. After accumulating nine years in office over three terms, that is a measure of his political guts, however limited his political achievements.But his victory revealed deep divisions within Israeli society, and a long season of Israeli uncertainty now looks inevitable, despite the cries of triumph from Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud Party. After a bitter campaign, voters converged on the two major parties, a measure of the widespread sense that Israel\u2019s future was at stake. Netanyahu seemed to have won about 30 seats, ahead of the estimated 24 seats of Isaac Herzog, the leader of the center-left Zionist Union. How a government coalition would be put together in the 120-seat Knesset and who would lead it remained an open question that is likely to take weeks of haggling to resolve. An election of uncertain outcome has already clarified certain things. The world, and certainly the White House, may be tired of Netanyahu, his fear-mongering and posturing, but his hawkish defiance and dismissal (now explicit) of a Palestinian state reflect a wide section of Israeli society that has given up on a two-state outcome and prefers its Palestinians invisible behind barriers. \u201cBibi, king of Israel,\u201d went supporters\u2019 chants after the vote. He\u2019s not a monarch but he sure looms large.\u201cRight-wing rule is in danger. Arab voters are streaming in huge quantities to the polling stations,\u201d Netanyahu said in a video released as votes were cast. To the last, he played on fear and incendiary division. It worked.But many Israelis are tired of Netanyahu\u2019s games; they embrace a different idea of Israel. That, too, became clear in this election and is of equal importance. Herzog, in forming the Zionist Union with Tzipi Livni, a former foreign minister, brought the moderate Israeli left back from the brink and, through the name of his movement, asserted a distinction critical to Israel\u2019s future: only a Zionism that preserves Israel as a Jewish and democratic state, in the image of its founders, can secure the nation\u2019s long-term future.The contrast with the Messianic Zionism of the right, with its religious-nationalist claim to all the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River, was clear. Herzog, unlike Netanyahu, is serious about the idea of two states, whatever the immense difficulties, because the alternative is the progressive corrosion of Israel\u2019s democratic ideals as it attempts to control the lives of millions of nonvoting Palestinians in the West Bank.The phenomenon of the election was Moshe Kahlon, a former Likud minister who became wildly popular in office by liberalizing Israel\u2019s cellphone market and reducing customers\u2019 bills. His success in getting nine or 10 seats at the head of a new party called Kulanu (\u201call of us\u201d) turned him into a possible kingmaker. It was also indicative of the frustrations of Israelis: with their successful but increasingly unequal economy, with corruption, and with business as usual. Kahlon has said he will wait for final results before indicating his allegiance, but suggested it was a \u201ctime to unite.\u201dIt will fall to President Reuven Rivlin to invite Netanyahu to try to form a stable coalition. He has already indicated his preference for the outcome, saying \u201cI am convinced only a unity government can prevent the rapid disintegration of Israel\u2019s democracy and new elections in the near future.\u201d But a unity government is anathema to both Netanyahu and Herzog, or at least has been up to now.Reality may, however, catch up with them. A Netanyahu-led right-wing government will face growing international isolation, especially because of the prime minister\u2019s open commitment to stop the emergence of a Palestinian state. Repairing relations with President Obama would be arduous. A hardening of America\u2019s position toward Israel at the United Nations cannot be ruled out, if West Bank settlements continue to expand. Israelis, for all their nation\u2019s extraordinary success, know how critical the alliance with the United States is; they are unhappy with the Netanyahu-Obama rift. A government of the right would more likely exacerbate than overcome that estrangement over the next couple of years.For Herzog, in the light of the right\u2019s strong performance, the path to a center-left-led government looks blocked \u2014 and achieving anything with such a government even more so. He would not have the muscle to bring real change on the central challenge facing Israel in its relations with the world: the Palestinian conflict. He did well, but not well enough to bring about the \u201cpost-Bibi era\u201d that he sought.As with Churchill\u2019s words on democracy, a national unity coalition now looks like the worst form of government for Israel except for all the others. It could curtail Netanyahu\u2019s hubris while giving Herzog heft, a\u00a0desirable double whammy. Frank Bruni is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart\u2019s Visible Hand", "Date": "2015-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome background: Conservatives \u2014 with the backing, I have to admit, of many economists \u2014 normally argue that the market for labor is like the market for anything else. The law of supply and demand, they say, determines the level of wages, and the invisible hand of the market will punish anyone who tries to defy this law. Specifically, this view implies that any attempt to push up wages will either fail or have bad consequences. Setting a minimum wage, it\u2019s claimed, will reduce employment and create a labor surplus, the same way attempts to put floors under the prices of agricultural commodities used to lead to butter mountains, wine lakes and so on. Pressuring employers to pay more, or encouraging workers to organize into unions, will have the same effect.But labor economists have long questioned this view. Soylent Green \u2014 I mean, the labor force \u2014 is people. And because workers are people, wages are not, in fact, like the price of butter, and how much workers are paid depends as much on social forces and political power as it does on simple supply and demand.Part of the answer is direct government intervention, especially during World War II, when government wage-setting authority was used to narrow gaps between the best paid and the worst paid. Part of it, surely, was a sharp increase in unionization. Part of it was the full-employment economy of the war years, which created very strong demand for workers and empowered them to seek higher pay. The important thing, however, is that the Great Compression didn\u2019t go away as soon as the war was over. Instead, full employment and pro-worker politics changed pay norms, and a strong middle class endured for more than a generation. Oh, and the decades after the war were also marked by unprecedented economic growth.Which brings me back to Walmart. What this means, in turn, is that engineering a significant pay raise for tens of millions of Americans would almost surely be much easier than conventional wisdom suggests. Raise minimum wages by a substantial amount; make it easier for workers to organize, increasing their bargaining power; direct monetary and fiscal policy toward full employment, as opposed to keeping the economy depressed out of fear that we\u2019ll suddenly turn into Weimar Germany. It\u2019s not a hard list to implement \u2014 and if we did these things we could make major strides back toward the kind of society most of us want to live in.The point is that extreme inequality and the falling fortunes of America\u2019s workers are a choice, not a destiny imposed by the gods of the market. And we can change that choice if we want to.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bloodshed in Tunisia", "Date": "2015-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThis is a fragile moment for Tunisia as it moves to consolidate the democracy put in place after the popular uprising four years ago that overthrew a dictator, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. As the country\u2019s leaders deal with the mounting security threats, they will have to be careful not to crush the civil liberties that are essential to any democratic society. The government needs economic aid and support in training its security forces from the United States, Europe and the Gulf states.Even before the museum attack, Tunisia had been struggling with security issues. An estimated 3,000 Tunisians are believed to have gone to fight with radical Islamists in Libya and Syria. Authorities have had a hard time stemming the weapons flowing across the border from a chaotic Libya. There have also been numerous attacks on security forces since 2011. In 2013, two leftist politicians were killed in separate incidents that threatened to derail the transition to democracy. Economic concerns drove Tunisia\u2019s revolutionaries into the streets in 2011, and the country still lacks the jobs, foreign investment and trade that could put it on a firm footing.One bright spot is the fact that Ennahda, the moderate Islamist party that swept to power in the postrevolution elections and then lost to the secular Nidaa Tounes party last October, has continued to work constructively within the system and has some members in the coalition government. The party\u2019s leader, Rachid Ghannouchi, has long argued that democracy and Islam can coexist. On Wednesday, he issued a statement condemning the attack, stressing that it will not \u201cundermine our revolution and our democracy.\u201dSecular hard-liners in the political establishment no doubt will try to exploit the killings as reason to crack down on even moderate Islamists and crush any dissent. The right response is to keep working to strengthen Tunisia\u2019s democracy and expand political freedoms while also working with the international community to improve the economy. The country has been an example of sanity in a region consumed by chaos and dominated by authoritarian governments. It will need substantial international help to stay that way. Advertisement"}

Indeed, infrastructure and transportation are two of the primary ways the government is propelling this economic growth, and I have observed these changes during recent research trips to Ethiopia.As construction projects transform Ethiopia, it is important also to consider what these changes will mean for ordinary interactions.Addis Ababa, the capital, is rapidly changing with new shopping centers, housing complexes and highways being constantly constructed. The Chinese-sponsored light rail is one of the biggest changes to the city\u2019s landscape.The railway should reduce transportation times and connect neighborhoods in new ways. Yet it also poses new challenges and causes disruptions, as frequently used intersections, bus stops and crosswalks are blocked.The city\u2019s drivers and pedestrians must adapt to new ways of navigating street crossings and traversing the city as the railway redefines traffic patterns.As light rail expands in Addis Ababa and it forges greater connections to other cities in Ethiopia and Djibouti by rail, it will continue to transform the country\u2019s modes of transportation and its landscape.The writer is an assistant professor of Africana studies at Wellesley College.

{"Headline": "European Court Upholds British View on Euro Clearinghouses", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In a judgment with political and financial ramifications, a European court on Wednesday ruled that the European Central Bank cannot require financial houses that clear trades of euro-denominated securities to be in eurozone countries.The central bank had defended the geographical requirement as a policy statement rather than a rule it would try to enforce. But Britain, which is part of the European Union but uses its own currency, the pound, challenged the central bank in the General Court, Europe\u2019s second-highest.The British government, seeking to protect London as a global financial hub, had feared that big clearinghouses like LCH.Clearnet might come under pressure to shift some of its euro-denominated operations to cities on the European Continent, like Paris. Significant sums of money could be at stake. In 2013, LCH Clearnet alone had revenue of 380 million euros, or about $425 million.The legal action had become something of a political test case for Britain, where a public debate is underway about how much influence the country has and should have within the European Union \u2014 and even, among some politicians, whether Britain should remain part of the bloc.British policy makers have also long suspected that rival financial centers in Frankfurt and Paris would try to take advantage of Britain\u2019s self-exclusion from the euro currency union to lure business from London. Clearinghouses, including the London operations of CME Clearing Europe and ICE Clear Europe, are intermediaries in trades like stocks, bonds or derivatives and ensure that transactions are completed even if one party fails to honor its obligations.After the court ruling was announced, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, described it as a \u201cmajor win for Britain and a major win for all those who want to see a European economy that is both open and successful.\u201dIn a statement, Mr. Osborne also argued that the ruling upheld the primacy of Europe\u2019s single market, which ensures the freedom to trade throughout the union, which has a population of around 500 million.\u201cWe have been consistently clear there needs to be a level playing field for all countries in Europe\u2019s single market, whether they are in the eurozone or not,\u201d Mr. Osborne said.The European Central Bank said in a statement on Wednesday that it would \u201ccarefully consider the General Court\u2019s judgment and decide on the way forward as soon as such analysis will be completed.\u201dWednesday\u2019s ruling came at a sensitive time in Britain. A general election is set for May, and Prime Minister David Cameron has promised that, if re-elected, he will hold a referendum by 2017 on British membership in the European Union.Critics of the bloc would have gained fresh ammunition had the ruling, from the Luxembourg-based General Court of the European Union, gone the other way.Underlying Mr. Osborne\u2019s legal challenge was a worry that, as the 19-nation eurozone integrates more closely after its debt crisis, Britain will be increasingly marginalized.Even supporters of British membership in the European Union sometimes fear that divisions between those inside and outside the eurozone could undermine the bloc\u2019s single market \u2014 a key attraction for the British.At issue was a policy laid out by the European Central Bank in July 2011, which said that bodies that settle euro-denominated transactions should be legally incorporated in the euro area. Full managerial and operational control and responsibility, overall core functions, should be exercised from within that single currency zone, it suggested.The European Central Bank argued that oversight would be easier if clearing houses with a net daily credit exposure of more than 5 billion euros, or about $5.6 billion, were in the eurozone.The court ruled that such a requirement went beyond oversight and strayed into regulation. The court concluded that the central bank did not have the legal right to regulate the activity of securities clearing systems.The ruling was welcomed by Britain\u2019s main business lobby organization, the Confederation of British Industry, whose director general, John Cridland, described it as a \u201clandmark judgment upholding the E.U.\u2019s single market, setting the boundaries of what the E.C.B. can do to support the eurozone without the agreement of non-euro member states.\u201dIntegration of the eurozone \u201ccannot and should not compromise the principle of the single market,\u201d Mr. Cridland added.But there was a more skeptical reaction from Matthew Elliott, the chief executive of Business for Britain, an organization that wants a renegotiation of the terms of Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union and a referendum on whether to stay.Mr. Elliott described the ruling as \u201cgood news\u201d but added, \u201cit\u2019s a pity that the U.K. was forced to resort to such drastic measures in the first place.\u201d\u201cWe have a wider battle to win to protect our position as a non-eurozone member state, and we need to vehemently resist any attempts to introduce this policy via the other European institutions,\u201d he said.The European Central Bank could appeal, on legal points, to Europe\u2019s top court, the European Court of Justice, which is also in Luxembourg.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Well for Corporate Bailouts Appears to Be Running Dry", "Date": "2015-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo far, companies have requested at least $37 billion, a figure that is likely to rise much higher.\u201cQuite a large number of companies have access to no other source of funding,\u201d said Vladimir I. Tikhomirov, the chief economist at BCS Financial Group.But the sovereign wealth fund, the National Wellbeing Fund, might not have enough to cover their needs. The fund had roughly $75 billion in reserves at the beginning of the month.About a quarter of the money is held in illiquid assets, so it can\u2019t be parceled out for the bailout program. Some of the money is also allocated for infrastructure. In all, the illiquid assets, the infrastructure works and bailout requests amount to at least $82 billion.The sovereign wealth fund is trying to stretch the rubles by lending money to banks to buy corporate bonds of needy companies. The banks get capital; the companies get much-needed funds. In essence, every 1 billion rubles covers two bailout needs.That strategy, though, could create its own headaches. If oil prices fall and the economy weakens further, the bonds may not be worth as much, putting the banks and companies in a financial bind.\u201cThere is a cushion for the short-term drop in oil prices, but there is no cushion for the long-term one,\u201d Kenneth Rogoff, a former director of the International Monetary Fund, said at the Gaidar Economic Forum in Moscow earlier this year.Like many petroleum exporting nations, Russia socked away reserves during years of high oil prices. But the government is now rapidly spending those funds, with oil prices now hovering around $60 a barrel. Western sanctions over the Ukraine conflict are adding to the financial tumult.The country is far from running out of money. Russia still has $360 billion in reserves, although that is down from more than $490 billion a year ago.The central bank has been tapping the funds to help prop up the ruble. When it comes to companies, the process gets a bit more complicated.And money in the Reserve Fund, roughly $77 billion, is largely spoken for. Under a budget tentatively approved in the cabinet on Thursday, the government intends to spend about $52.4 billion, or two-thirds of the Reserve Fund, this year, and most of the rest in 2016.Tapping the Wellbeing Fund has been controversial from the start as it is technically part of Russia\u2019s pension system.In the first months of this year, the fight for the fund\u2019s money mirrored the broader economic struggle of modern Russia, as oligarchs and their state-linked businesses compete fiercely with the needs of struggling pensioners for the wealth of the country.A big worry was that pension funds would be used to prop up sanctioned companies. The government has even discussed the politically perilous idea of raising the retirement age to avoid a pension shortfall in coming years.Doling out the fund\u2019s money became so imbued by politics that by February, President Vladimir V. Putin introduced a rule requiring presidential approval for all new allocations. He also shifted management to himself, from his prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, who oversaw the funds through the ministry of finance. It all happened at a high-powered meeting of top government officials at Mr. Putin\u2019s country home, or dacha, a residence called Novo-Ogaryovo, outside Moscow.In the struggle for the fund\u2019s resources, a plan emerged to spend each ruble twice. The bonds will inject money directly into the companies. In turn, the banks can place the bonds with the central bank as collateral for loans, plumping up their capital.Assuming the economic environment doesn\u2019t shift, it could work. But if the economic recession deepens, the market price of the bonds could fall. In that case, the banks will have to cut the value of the bonds on their balance sheets, eroding their capital base.The plan could also create tumult in the market. Late last year, the central bank decided to accept Rosneft bonds held by commercial banks as collateral for loans. Rosneft then issued 625 billion rubles in new bonds. The bonds were bought in part by large banks, which could use the bonds to get loans from the central bank.The strategy, essentially a complicated maneuver by the government to help bail out Rosneft, rocked the markets. The ruble dropped 10 percent in a single day, prompting the central bank to sharply increase its main interest rate in the middle of the night.But Russian companies, particularly those in the energy sector, don\u2019t have many options in the current environment.Rosneft originally asked for $50 billion from the government. It scaled back the request in January to $21 billion, roughly in line with the amount of debt the company has coming due this year.On Thursday, GazpromNeft, the oil arm of Gazprom, confirmed that it had applied to the government for funding. Aleksandr Dyukov, the chief executive of Gazprom Neft, asked for $3.2 billion from the Wellbeing Fund and a Central Bank program of subsidized lending. In a letter to a deputy prime minister, Mr. Dyukov cited the main problems: sanctions and the lack of other sources of financing in Russia.Advertisement"}

First, Mr. Gates shows Mr. Rose the Codex Leicester, a 500-year-old Leonardo da Vinci manuscript that Mr. Gates bought in 1994 for $30 million. Still, at just 200 or so volumes, Mr. Gates\u2019s collection was not nearly big enough to establish him as the world\u2019s greatest Great Courses collector.\u201cWe just had somebody last month who bought the entire library,\u201d says Ed Leon, chief brand officer of the Great Courses. \u201cIt\u2019s someone who seems to have made a lot of money in finance and retired to a tropical island. That\u2019s where we shipped the entire library \u2014 over 500 courses.\u201dWhat does it mean when people who can afford to spend their time however they please hunker down in front of their flat screens to watch theoretical physicists or experts on other subjects lecture for hours?These days, examples of what is often called edutainment are everywhere. As the word suggests, edutainment combines aspects of education and entertainment into products and experiences that seek to improve learning by making it not just painless but also pleasurable.And while consumers will often pay prices that would please any Ivy League bursar, this kind of education is generally pursued on an elective basis, with no credits or certification at stake.Learning through entertainment dates at least to Ben Franklin\u2019s Poor Richard\u2019s Almanack, which amused and instructed colonists with its mix of maxims, weather forecasts, math lessons and puzzles. But traditionally, edutainment resulted from the kinds of things Neil Postman, a New York University professor and media theorist, criticized in his 1985 book, \u201cAmusing Ourselves to Death.\u201d In it, he argued that culture\u2019s primary mode of discourse was shifting from print to TV, and that as a result, \u201cpolitics, religion, news, athletics, education and commerce\u201d had all been \u201ctransformed into congenial adjuncts of show business.\u201d In Mr. Postman\u2019s formulation of the world, show business alone did the encroaching. Lessons about multiplication were put to music. Local TV news anchors adopted the mindless patter of variety-show M.C.s.But what is most notable about the current edutainment boom is how often it uses formats and techniques from education and academia to invade domains that were once primarily recreational \u2014 or at least nonacademic.In the old days, business people networked over martinis. Now they prepare to mingle by consuming multiple TED Talks lectures (TED stands for technology, entertainment, design). Likewise, it sometimes seems as if no luxury vacation is complete without a concierge biologist on hand to decipher the mating habits of the mantled howler monkey. And thanks to farmers markets, picking up milk and eggs has turned into a chance for informal symposiums on pasture management. Finally, there is fare like the Great Courses and online learning sites like Lynda.com, CreativeLive.com and EdX.org. Such material is hardly fodder for channel surfers. The Great Courses (which also come in audio formats) feature a college professor lecturing from 12 to 24 hours on topics like ancient Mesoamerica or behavioral economics. The living room couch in front of the television now functions as a site for in-depth learning.Many factors underlie the ascent of such learning products. An aging population has leisure time and money to spend. Digital distribution lets content creators focus on smaller audiences with more specialized interests, and it gives users access to these products anywhere and anytime. The proliferation of media that results has in turn created a market for live events like TED Talks, the music and multimedia gathering SXSW and the Comic-Con fan conventions, all of which offer lectures and symposiums that can turn up online later.As long-established companies and personalities look for new sources of revenue in a rapidly shifting media market, they turn to educational offerings as well.\u201cI think like everyone else, we\u2019re looking for new opportunities that bring in revenue and keep in line with our mission,\u201d says Linda St. Thomas, chief spokeswoman for the Smithsonian Institution. To this end, the Smithsonian has begun offering classes through the Great Courses line, as have National Geographic, the Culinary Institute of America and the Mayo Clinic. The Smithsonian, through its Journeys program, and National Geographic, through its Expeditions program, also offer more than 200 learning vacations a year, charging travelers thousands of dollars to forsake drinks by the pool for in-the-field instruction from art historians and volcanologists. The New York Times has ventured into this territory with its Times Journeys program, and it sells tickets to question-and-answer sessions with figures from the film and music industries, among others. In \u201cAmusing Ourselves to Death,\u201d Mr. Postman lamented that a former Hollywood actor could be president. Now, former presidents are replacing professional entertainers as the top-billed stars on cruise ship vacations. Lech Walesa, former president of Poland, will visit with Smithsonian Journeys participants in Gdansk this summer. C\u00e9sar Gaviria, former president of Colombia, will be on hand on a National Geographic Expeditions cruise off South America this fall.While lunching with celebrity politicians on luxury cruises may seem frivolous, what has actually happened is that a purely recreational activity has acquired new intellectual ambition. \u201cThere\u2019s an increasing demand for meaningful experiences,\u201d says Lynn Cutter, National Geographic\u2019s executive vice president for travel and licensing. \u201cWhen people have choices on how to spend their money, they\u2019re valuing experiences more than material things.\u201dAnd learning is often a crucial part of these experiences, partly because Americans today are much more educated than their predecessors. In 1940, according to United States census data, only 25 percent of American citizens ages 25 or above had high school diplomas or their equivalents. And only 5 percent of American citizens 25 or above had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. By 2009, 87 percent of this demographic had a high school diploma, and 30 percent had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher.Not that education ends with a bachelor\u2019s degree these days, or even a Ph.D. In the fast-paced knowledge economy, lifelong earning requires lifelong learning. To keep their skills sharp and maximize income or employability, people turn to sites like CreativeLive.com to fine-tune their Photoshop expertise or learn how to use Instagram as a sales channel.\u201cWe\u2019ve served up more than two billion minutes of free education to every country on the planet,\u201d says Chase Jarvis, the site\u2019s chief executive and one of its founders. Most of CreativeLive\u2019s classes, which are clustered into categories like \u201cPhoto and Video\u201d and \u201cArt and Design\u201d and streamed live from the company\u2019s broadcast studios in Seattle and San Francisco, are intended to help people develop skills to put to professional use. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is create the most vibrant learning experience we can,\u201d Mr. Jarvis says. \u201cWhen we do a podcasting class, we get Alex Blumberg, a former producer for \u2018This American Life,\u2019 to teach it. And since he\u2019s the best in the world at what he does, he puts on an amazing show.\u201dThe surest way to dazzle today\u2019s lifelong learners is through expertise and instruction, not gimmicky and tacked-on showbiz elements. And yet because there is a sizable paying market for educational media \u2014 CreativeLive.com offers the initial live broadcasts of its classes free, then charges $24 to $299 for on-demand access to them \u2014 producers are investing more in this material. As a result, the teaching talent becomes better, the production values improve and educational courseware can be just as engaging as any other form of media.It often has to be, says Nick Macey, chief product officer of Rosetta Stone, a language-learning software company. Mr. Macey has to develop products that people enjoy enough to use regularly and intensively, because that is what it takes to learn a new language. \u201cSo whether it\u2019s through highly entertaining content or live experiences with native speakers, we\u2019re always looking for ways to engage our customers,\u201d Mr. Macey says. As material becomes more enjoyable, ultimately some people begin to approach even difficult and sustained feats of learning, like achieving conversational fluency in Mandarin, as a way to unwind at the end of the day.\u201cEducated people love to learn,\u201d notes Randy White, chief executive of the White Hutchinson Leisure and Learning Group, a company based in Kansas City, Mo., that helps develop things like children\u2019s play centers and farmers markets that combine education and entertainment.These new educational approaches offer a more structured and productive experience than watching a situation comedy or a reality show. But the experience can also be as informal as you want it to be. \u201cThere are no exams,\u201d the Great Courses website reassures. \u201cNo homework assignments. No prerequisites.\u201dStill, people accustomed to a steady stream of likes, retweets and other soft forms of assessment often view exams and quizzes as good things. Rouxbe.com is an online cooking school whose curriculum is so comprehensive that restaurants and culinary academies use it as a training tool. But according to Joe Girard, its chief executive, 80 percent of its customers are home cooks. And they want feedback. \u201cNot everyone thought that our customers would do quizzes,\u201d Mr. Girard says. \u201cBut in the first six months that we introduced them, we had 500,000 quizzes completed. People love affirmation. They love to see that because they watched a video, they now know something they didn\u2019t previously know.\u201dPeople also recognize that the Internet puts answers, experts and detailed instruction at their fingertips. And that increases their curiosity and willingness to tackle new subjects.\u201cToday, people learn online first,\u201d says Jen Long, co-founder of GardenTribe.com, a California producer of online instruction for home gardeners. \u201cThere\u2019s no driving to the nursery. It\u2019s go to Google and type in, \u2018What should I plant in my garden?\u2019\u00a0\u201dThat is how it worked for one GardenTribe.com customer, Odessa Criales-Smith. \u201cI did a Google search because I wanted to learn more about succulents,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d find. I was just searching for any information at all.\u201dA software reseller who works from home in Lovettsville, Va., Ms. Criales-Smith often used online courses to obtain certifications for the various lines of software she sells. So when GardenTribe.com came up in her search results, she bought access to one of its classes.\u201cI was just looking for a hobby to chill on,\u201d Ms. Criales-Smith says. \u201cSucculents was a great relaxing thing to do.\u201d After viewing the first video, Ms. Criales-Smith bought additional classes and watched them at night in bed, projecting them from her tablet onto her large-screen TV using Google\u2019s Chromecast device. Over time, she says, she turned into a \u201csucculents fanatic.\u201d And eventually, she began attending antiques shows and flea markets to sell arrangements that she makes of succulent plants. \u201cTaking that class gave me the confidence to go ahead and start something,\u201d she says.That first GardenTribe.com class that Ms. Criales-Smith took now goes for $39. The DVD version of the Great Courses class \u201cThe Higgs Boson and Beyond\u201d sells for $199.95. \u201cChanging Tides of History: Cruising the Baltic Sea,\u201d the Smithsonian Journeys vacation where you can talk about globalization with Lech Walesa, starts at $6,995.It is not always clear if a product or event is being used as entertainment or, say, corporate training. So creditable estimates of the size of the edutainment industry are hard to come by. What is clear is that its target consumers are willing to pay for the experiences it can deliver. \u201cThe most educated have the least amount of time,\u201d Mr. White observes. \u201cSo when they spend their leisure time, they want it as productive and high quality as possible. They\u2019re looking for experiences that can permanently change themselves \u2014 going to a fitness facility, gaining new knowledge. They don\u2019t want to waste their leisure time.\u201dAt the Great Courses, there is a rigorous process to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. \u201cFirst, we write up a synopsis of what we want a title to be,\u201d Mr. Leon says. \u201cThen we poll that with our customer basis.\u201d If it performs well, the company starts looking for professors to teach the course. \u201cI have a recruiting team that scours the country for just the right person.\u201d Candidates travel to the Great Courses studio in Chantilly, Va., and record a lecture. \u201cWe have a variety of people test for the same course,\u201d Mr. Leon says. The samples are market-tested as well. \u201cOur customers are going to spend 12 to 24 hours of screen time with this person, so it has to be someone who resonates with them.\u201dOnce a professor is chosen, a course goes into full production. In 2015, the Great Courses will release about 40 new classes.\u201cThis year, we\u2019ve got 550 hours of content coming out of our studio,\u201d Mr. Leon says. Because of all of that exposure to subjects like data analytics or world\u2019s greatest churches, Mr. Leon says, \u201cMy production team is turning into semi-geniuses.\u201d On an unnamed tropical island, a mysterious retired polymath may be, too.

{"Headline": "House Republican Budget Overhauls Medicare and Repeals the Health Law", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans on Tuesday will unveil a proposed budget for 2016 that partly privatizes Medicare, turns Medicaid into block grants to the states, repeals the Affordable Care Act and reaches balance in 10 years, challenging Republicans in Congress to make good on their promises to deeply cut federal spending.The House proposal leans heavily on the policy prescriptions that Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin outlined when he was budget chairman, according to senior House Republican aides and members of Congress who were not authorized to speak in advance of the official release.With the Senate now also in Republican hands, this year\u2019s proposal is more politically salient than in years past, especially for Republican senators facing re-election in Democratic or swing states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Illinois and New Hampshire, and for potential Republican presidential candidates. Mr. Ryan\u2019s successor, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, promised on Monday \u201ca plan to get Washington\u2019s fiscal house in order, promote a healthy economy, protect our nation and save and strengthen vital programs like Medicare.\u201dDemocrats \u2014 and those Republicans who support robust military spending \u2014 will not see Mr. Price\u2019s \u201cBalanced Budget for a Stronger America\u201d in those terms. Opponents plan to hammer Republican priorities this week, as the House and Senate budget committees officially begin drafting their plans on Wednesday, and then try to pass them through their chambers this month. On Monday, President Obama tried to get ahead of the debate by criticizing Republican plans to abide by strict domestic and military spending caps.\u201cI can tell you that if the budget maintains sequester-level funding, then we would actually be spending less on pre-K to 12th grade in America\u2019s schools in terms of federal support than we were back in 2000,\u201d the president said in a speech to the Council of the Great City Schools. \u201cThe notion that we would be going backward instead of forwards in how we\u2019re devoting resources to educating our kids makes absolutely no sense.\u201dBut Republican aides said they have weathered those attacks ever since Mr. Ryan released his first budget plan in 2011. They said the easiest way to prevail in the House, at least, is to put forward the budget plan most House members have voted on multiple times.\u201cWe\u2019ve had House people vote on these four years in a row. We\u2019ve held on to our majority and even expanded it,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma and a Budget Committee member. \u201cThe idea you\u2019re going to lose an election on this is more political theater than political reality.\u201dCongressional budgets do not have the force of law and are largely advisory documents, but they represent the broadest statement of governing philosophy each year and set overall spending levels for the coming fiscal year. And in coming months, this one may contain language easing passage of taxation and entitlement legislation. Under congressional rules, a budget cannot be filibustered in the Senate, so Republicans would bear most of the responsibility if they failed to pass one.House Budget Committee members previewed their plans in an unusual, campaign-style video on Monday. The plan envisions a remaking of the federal government. Future recipients of Medicare would be offered voucherlike \u201cpremium support\u201d to pay for private insurance rather than government-provided health care.Spending on Medicaid would be cut substantially over 10 years, with the money turned into block grants to state governments, which in turn would have much more flexibility in deciding how it is allocated.The budget \u201crepeals all of Obamacare,\u201d Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee, said the same day the Obama administration announced that the law had provided coverage to 16.4 million previously uninsured people. To placate advocates of the military who say strict budget caps are hurting national defense, the House budget adds \u201cemergency\u201d war spending through the \u201coverseas contingency operations\u201d account, which does not count against the spending limits.The budget will also include language that orders members of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee to draft a \u201cfairer, simpler tax code,\u201d said Representative Todd Rokita, Republican of Indiana.And it will include parliamentary language \u2014 called \u201creconciliation\u201d \u2014 aimed at allowing legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act to pass the Senate with a simple majority. If that bill is passed, it will still be subject to a presidential veto.Conservative groups insist Republicans must keep their promise and repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201cRepublicans owe their majorities to their unwavering opposition to Obamacare, a reality that must be reflected in the budget,\u201d declared Heritage Action, the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cA throwaway line that the budget \u2018repeals Obamacare in its entirety\u2019 is not enough.\u201dHouse Republicans conceded on Monday that the Senate was not likely to propose such extensive cuts. Even before the Senate plan is unveiled, deep rifts are appearing. Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, reiterated his demand on Monday that any budget raise military spending well above the statutory caps. And he said he would not accept an approach that raised spending through the war-fighting emergency account or by shifting money from already squeezed domestic programs.Last year, Mr. Ryan called \u201cemergency spending\u201d increases \u201ca backdoor loophole that undermines the integrity of the budget process.\u201dRepublican leaders worry that the Republican senators making moves to run for president \u2014 Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Marco Rubio of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina \u2014 will never find a budget to their liking. At the same time, Republican senators from Democratic states, such as Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, will be hard-pressed to agree to the House\u2019s conservative vision.In 2013, when the Senate was presented an amendment to prohibit replacing Medicare\u2019s guaranteed benefits \u201cwith the House passed budget plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program,\u201d 96 senators agreed. Only three, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Paul and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, supported the House\u2019s vision.\u201cHistorically, the Senate has been less willing to take on the tough issues, and the early sounds are they\u2019re not going to do a Ryan-type Medicare-Medicaid plan,\u201d Mr. Cole said. \u201cThey face a very difficult election atmosphere next year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Eye of Economic Storm, the Fed Blinked ", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYear of FrettingWASHINGTON \u2014 When Ben S. Bernanke walked into the Federal Reserve\u2019s ornate boardroom in December 2009, the officials who were gathered around the long table gave the Fed\u2019s chairman a standing ovation.Mr. Bernanke had just been crowned Person of the Year by Time magazine. The recession had ended, unemployment had crested and Mr. Bernanke was widely regarded as singularly responsible.But the return to normalcy that Mr. Bernanke and his committee began to chart at that end-of-the-year meeting soon proved premature. The Fed had arrested the financial crisis, but the moment would also turn out to be the beginning of a yearslong series of failures to provide a sufficiently large dose of stimulus to restore the battered American economy to its previous health. Transcripts the Fed released on Wednesday of its 2009 policy meetings show that Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues had a relatively clear understanding of the depth of the nation\u2019s economic problems. But they were hobbled by doubts about the Fed\u2019s ability to do more and by concerns about the potential political and economic consequences.At that December meeting, Mr. Bernanke told his colleagues that he was acutely aware of \u201cfairly substantial\u201d calls for the Fed to be doing \u201ca lot more.\u201d But he quickly added: \u201cThe reason I personally, at least, am not convinced that that\u2019s the right way to go is that the connection between what actions we can take at this point and effective easing in the markets is not at all clear. For example, on the one hand, mortgage rates are already extraordinarily low \u2014 it\u2019s not clear that we can lower them much more.\u201dHe would eventually change his mind. Over the course of his second term as Fed chairman, which began in early 2010, Mr. Bernanke orchestrated three more rounds of bond buying, more than tripling the volume of purchases that the Fed had made during 2009.In the early months of that year, the Fed pressed ahead with the bold measures it had initiated in 2008 to arrest the financial crisis. By summer it had largely succeeded.The latest batch of crisis-era transcripts \u2014 the Fed releases annual installments after a five-year delay \u2014 adds a chapter to the Fed\u2019s halting journey from a single-minded focus on inflation in the years before the crisis to its broad and continuing embrace of responsibility for stabilizing the financial system and reviving job growth. Mr. Bernanke, who left the Fed last year at the end of his second term, emerges as a perceptive judge of economic conditions and a consultative leader who rarely pushed to impose his perspective on his colleagues, even when he turned out to be right. His successor, Janet L. Yellen, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, appears in these transcripts as prescient in her concerns about the enduring weakness of the economy. She warned at the December meeting that the Fed might need to resume its bond buying \u2014 but she went no further, and neither did anyone else. In early 2009, financial markets were still in disarray, and Fed officials worked closely with the incoming Obama administration on a successful plan to restore confidence through a series of measures, including theatrical \u201cstress tests\u201d of the largest banks.At the same time, the Fed began to shift from firefighting to reconstruction, the work that remains its focus. The Fed had already reduced its benchmark interest rate nearly to zero in December 2008. It had also started to buy mortgage-backed securities in January, seeking to revive the availability of financing for borrowers. At the Fed\u2019s second meeting of the year, in March, officials agreed to expand that program substantially. On top of the existing plan to buy $600 billion in mortgage bonds, the Fed said it would buy a further $1.05 trillion in mortgage bonds and Treasury securities. Fed officials arrived in a mood of profound concern.Just three nights earlier, Mr. Bernanke told the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d during the first live interview conducted by a Fed chairman, that he saw \u201cgreen shoots\u201d \u2014 signs of emerging recovery in financial markets. But at the meeting, Mr. Bernanke made clear the overall picture was still grim, and other officials agreed.Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said he had taken soundings from 29 corporate executives. \u201cIn fact,\u201d Mr. Fisher said, \u201cone actually called me and said, \u2018Do you want some good news?\u2019\u00a0In the early months of that year, the Fed pressed ahead with the bold measures it had initiated in 2008 to arrest the financial crisis.\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Please.\u2019\u00a0\u201cHe said, \u2018Call somebody else.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSome thought the Fed should buy more bonds, including William C. Dudley, the newly installed president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Another official, James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, argued that the Fed should not set a limit but instead should announce that it would purchase a certain volume of bonds each month. The Fed eventually concluded in 2013 that Mr. Bullard\u2019s proposal was the most effective way to conduct a bond-buying program. But caution prevailed. Ms. Yellen, among others, worried that a larger balance sheet could interfere with the Fed\u2019s ability to increase interest rates as the economy began to recover. Officials also worried the Fed could overwhelm the capacity of the financial system if it tried to buy too many bonds. And, from the outset, some officials fretted that higher inflation would surely result.The greatest doubts, however, were focused on the likely benefits of the purchases, particularly of Treasury securities. Officials generally agreed that buying mortgage bonds was helping, but there were no comparable problems in the Treasury market. The best argument, several officials said, was simply the idea that it was worth trying everything. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly how much a Treasury purchase program would do, but, if we start one, we\u2019ll be able to answer that question,\u201d Mr. Dudley said.The Fed has publicly insisted in the intervening years that buying Treasury bonds had important benefits, even as a number of academics have published studies contradicting that conclusion. Mr. Bernanke joked last year, \u201cThe problem with Q.E. is it works in practice, but it doesn\u2019t work in theory.\u201d But the transcripts show that Fed officials at the time harbored the opposite view.\u201cOn theoretical grounds, I believe there\u2019s a very strong case that they should have some effect, but it has been awfully hard to identify exactly what that effect is,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at the Fed\u2019s June meeting. \u201cI would say the benefits don\u2019t merit the costs.\u201dBy the second half of 2009, this skepticism was being reinforced by optimism that the recession was over. The National Bureau of Economic Research would later determine the downturn had ended in June.\u201cI think it does appear that the real economy is reaching something of an inflection point,\u201d Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said on June 24, accurately capturing the underlying shift. But even though the economic ship was no longer sinking, it was still struggling to advance. \u201cIf you put all of those imbalances together and you think about what is going to support sustainable economic growth, it is a little hard to see where a robust recovery is going to come from,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said in April, and he maintained this caution through the rest of the year.Daniel Tarullo, a Fed governor, noted at the Fed\u2019s November meeting that the word he had heard the most during the discussions was \u201csluggish.\u201dBut when the Fed convened in December, there was unanimous agreement it was time to stop buying bonds.Mr. Bernanke expressed \u201csomewhat more confidence\u201d about the health of the economy, although he was careful to describe the Fed as \u201cwalking on eggshells.\u201d Elizabeth A. Duke, a Fed governor, said the mortgage market still needed help, but she doubted that the central bank could provide it by buying more bonds.\u201cI think there\u2019s uncertainty about the benefits of adding to our longer-term purchases and some costs to that as well, so I\u2019m not prepared to argue for that,\u201d said Donald L. Kohn, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman.Ms. Yellen warned in November that retreating too quickly might leave the economy in a \u201cdangerous deflationary situation,\u201d a prescient forecast. Now she told the committee that she had shown the Fed\u2019s optimistic job growth forecast to the San Francisco Fed\u2019s board.They were \u201cincredulous,\u201d she said. But Ms. Yellen did not push for the Fed to keep buying bonds. She noted only that if the retreat went badly, \u201cI think we may need to resume purchases.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Car Dealerships\u2019 Ranks Thinned, the Survivors Thrive", "Date": "2015-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsONLY a few years ago, in the depths of the recession, the local car dealership seemed to be living on borrowed time. Franchises were closing by the hundreds as buyers stayed away from what were increasingly seen as outmoded showrooms.The franchise car dealer is not only surviving, but even thriving.A big reason for the revival is the simple math of fewer locations receiving more business. A decade ago, there were about 22,000 dealerships around the country. Today, that number is closer to 18,000. Also, strong franchise laws \u2014 fiercely defended in state legislatures \u2014 still give dealers a virtual monopoly on selling new cars.But industry experts say the story goes much deeper than that, and reflects a profound shift in the business model of auto sales. Dealerships increasingly have the high-tech atmosphere of an Apple Store, and consumers arrive fully informed about a car\u2019s features and price. It\u2019s a marked departure from the high-pressure sales environment traditionally associated with dealerships.Laji Isac, of Houston, is typical of the new breed of car buyer. He spent barely two hours at Gillman Honda, a family-owned dealership with about a dozen stores, when he bought his new Honda Accord.\u201cAll the negotiations were over email,\u201d Mr. Isac, 32, said. Once he settled on a price, he showed up to find the car waiting for him, took it for a test drive and filled out the paperwork. He was soon on his way.\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing now is the culmination of lots of changes that have been building in recent years,\u201d said Steven Szakaly, chief economist with the National Automobile Dealers Association.New technology is not only changing the car-buying experience, but it is also fostering rapid consolidation in the industry. Mom-and-pop auto dealerships, once prevalent a generation ago, are disappearing as larger corporations expand their reach over more locations.Between 2011 and 2014, the number of dealership groups with revenue of $1 billion or more doubled, to 43 from 21, according to data from Wards Auto. In 2011, only 13 dealerships in the country had more than 30 stores. By 2014, that number had risen by nearly 50 percent, to 19 companies.The growth was even more evident at the very top, as the largest of the large consolidated even more locations under their umbrellas. AutoNation, the country\u2019s biggest chain, went from 206 stores in 2011 to 228 last year (and has since grown to 282). Penske Automotive had 145 in 2011; last year it had 194. Group 1 Automotive jumped to 148 dealership locations, from 100, over the same period. Hendrick Automotive, based in Charlotte, N.C., went to 86 from 66.The Van Tuyl Group, which has been renamed Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, had 67 dealerships in 2011. The group now has 78. Berkshire Hathaway had no comment on the acquisition.\u201cThe larger you get, the more you can take advantage of economies of scale,\u201d Mr. Szakaly said. He noted that although revenue was up among dealers, their profit margin had remained flat in recent years, at about 2 percent. The largest dealer groups, however, are able to squeeze closer to 3 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy business, and so if you can reduce overhead expenses, you\u2019re talking about a big impact,\u201d he said.Workers in areas like financing, accounting, inventory and human resources \u2014 the so-called back-office staff \u2014 can be shared among multiple dealers, saving thousands or even millions of dollars.Perhaps no dealer group exemplifies this trend more than AutoNation, a publicly traded dealership group. The company\u2019s entire back-office operation is housed in two huge buildings in Dallas.\u201cIt makes your productivity so much better,\u201d said Marc Cannon, AutoNation\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201cWe have people who handle the tasks like processing and bill payments, doing it full time in one place.\u201dBut size also carries another important benefit: more cars and trucks for buyers to choose from.\u201cWe have roughly 80,000 vehicles for sale right now,\u201d Mr. Cannon said. \u201cIf a customer wants a Chevy, they can search all of the Chevys we have in inventory.\u201dHere is where the digital revolution is reshaping the car-buying experience. Online tools from third-party sites and dealerships themselves now offer a shopper the ability to search countless vehicles locally and beyond \u2014 and more important, to compare prices instantly.AutoNation is introducing its own online marketplace, called SmartChoice Express, to let a customer find a car anywhere in the country, negotiate a price and then show up at a local store to find the keys and paperwork waiting.Third-party websites like Edmunds.com and TrueCar have upended the car-shopping process by offering similar features on a wider scale, which give consumers far more negotiating power than in the past. Not only can consumers research vehicles, but they can also get binding quotes from multiple dealers, without ever leaving the house.\u201cIt cuts down on a lot of the headache involved,\u201d Mr. Isac, the Houston car buyer, said.Avi Steinlauf, chief executive of Edmunds, said some consumers show up knowing more information about a vehicle than the sales representative. \u201cBut the forward-thinking dealers are adapting to this and embracing the technology,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they find they\u2019re making more sales than they ever did before.\u201dDespite his company\u2019s role in shifting the balance of power, Mr. Steinlauf said he believed dealers continued to play a vital role.\u201cYou\u2019re still talking about the second-largest purchase most people make,\u201d he said. \u201cMany consumers still want to touch the vehicle, sit in it, smell it.\u201dBut the nature of the interaction between buyer and seller is changing.\u201cThe salesman is really transitioning into more of a product specialist,\u201d said Mr. Szakaly, the N.A.D.A. economist. \u201cIt\u2019s not about someone who\u2019s there to haggle with you; it\u2019s about having you come in wanting to know about a product you\u2019re already decided you\u2019re interested in buying.\u201dRob Cochran, who owns a regional chain of about 20 dealerships around Pittsburgh, introduced new digital tools about two years ago to embrace the idea that consumers were using auto pricing websites. He said that since then, the kind of people he has hired to sell cars has started changing.\u201cI\u2019ve recruited salespeople who likely would never have entered the industry before,\u201d Mr. Cochran said. \u201cThere\u2019s an ease now to how they deal with people. There are less secrets about the process, and it\u2019s about making things hassle-free and upfront with the customers.\u201dMr. Cochran\u2019s dealerships began offering online pricing based on what sites like Edmunds recommended to its users. He even installed kiosks in his showrooms so that buyers and sales representatives could look up together what certain vehicles had been selling for.\u201cWe\u2019re inviting the data, and the response has been tremendous,\u201d Mr. Cochran said.Business has taken off, he said, and while he estimated he could have made more money on probably 15 percent of sales, the increased traffic through his showrooms more than made up for it. Stewart Easterby, chief operating officer of TrueCar, said that dealers like Mr. Cochran were realizing that they were better off riding the wave of the Internet revolution than trying to fight it.\u201cYou might sell some cars for less, but you\u2019re going to make it up in volume,\u201d Mr. Easterby said. \u201cBoth the consumer and the dealer wind up winning.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yellen Says Fed Will Increase Rates Slowly", "Date": "2015-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd her message was that the return to normal conditions was likely to come slowly. There will be no repeat of the two-year period beginning in June 2004 when the Fed raised rates by 0.25 percentage points at every meeting.\u201cThe average pace of tightening observed during previous recoveries could well provide a highly misleading guide to the actual course of monetary policy over the next few years,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.Ms. Yellen\u2019s speech was delivered hours after the Commerce Department reported, in its final revision, that the United States economy grew at a rate of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, down from a robust 5 percent pace during the summer months. Economists said that the economy probably slowed even further in the first quarter of this year, which ends on Tuesday.Despite the latest disappointing economic figures, Ms. Yellen emphasized that she saw the economy as improving, describing the current situation as a temporary slowdown during the winter months. She highlighted particular progress in labor markets, and said that she expected the economy to gain steam as consumer spending increased after a slow start to 2015.But Ms. Yellen offered a more cautious policy outlook than some of her colleagues. \u201cWith continued improvement in economic conditions,\u201d she said, \u201can increase in the target range for that rate may well be warranted later this year.\u201dFed officials have said they would closely monitor the course of the economy in determining when to raise interest rates and by how much. Raising rates tends to slow growth and restrain inflation, while keeping rates low helps encourage additional business activity and job hiring.Lately, even as the job market has displayed healthy signs of life \u2014 the unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent in February as employers hired 295,000 new workers \u2014 other indicators have been anemic. If the economy advances more strongly than most Fed officials expect, suggesting that inflation will eventually gain momentum, the central bank is likely to raise rates more aggressively than if job gains and economic growth are disappointing.This week, the government said durable goods orders fell last month and retail sales were also weak, despite benefits to consumers from low energy prices.The nation\u2019s manufacturers have also been hurt by a stronger dollar and weak conditions in key markets like Europe and Brazil, which has curbed exports.The downshift in early 2015 has echoes of the economy\u2019s performance in the first quarter of 2014, when cold temperatures and snow were blamed for a 2.1 percent contraction in output.Next week, the economic picture may become a bit clearer. Data are due on Friday on job creation and unemployment in March. Figures for the trade balance, home sales, personal consumption and construction in February are set to come out earlier in the week.In her speech in San Francisco, Ms. Yellen provided new insight into the Fed\u2019s decision-making process. She said the Fed would not wait for price inflation to increase before it moved to raise rates. She also played down the importance of wage inflation, an issue on which her views have evolved significantly.In speeches last year, Ms. Yellen highlighted the slow pace of wage inflation as evidence of slack in the labor market. But on Friday she described it as unreliable, saying that wages might be stagnating for a variety of reasons including globalization and the decline of unions.\u201cThe outlook for wages is highly uncertain even if price inflation does move back to 2 percent and labor market conditions continue to improve as projected,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cThis uncertainty limits the usefulness of wage trends as an indicator of the Fed\u2019s progress in achieving its inflation objective.\u201dMs. Yellen said that the Fed intended to focus on job growth, judging that if unemployment continued to fall, prices and wages would begin to rise.Ms. Yellen said the timing of the first increase, which many experts say is likely to take place in September, was less important than the pace of later ones, which would determine borrowing costs in coming years. And she gave three reasons the pace was likely to be quite slow.First, despite the Fed\u2019s campaign to revive growth, the economy remains weak, implying that the central bank\u2019s help is still needed. \u201cIf underlying conditions had truly returned to normal, the economy should be booming,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.Second, Ms. Yellen said, moving too quickly carries greater risks than tardiness. The Fed\u2019s tools for reviving growth are already in use; if the economy swoons, it is not clear how much more the Fed can do. And the Fed sees little risk in waiting: Ms. Yellen said she still saw little threat from any overheating in financial markets.Finally, Ms. Yellen said, there could be important economic benefits in limiting interest rate increases until the labor market had not only healed but also tightened considerably. Such patience could help to increase inflation, which in recent years has remained well below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed regards as most healthy.Ms. Yellen said that moving slowly could also help undo some damage caused by the recession.\u201cThe deep recession and slow recovery likely have held back investment in physical and human capital, restrained the rate of new business formation, prompted discouraged workers to leave the labor force and eroded the skills of the long-term unemployed,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of these effects might be reversed in a tight labor market.\u201dBinyamin Appelbaum reported from Washington, and Nelson D.

{"Headline": "Fate of Obama\u2019s Trade Agenda May Rest on Oregon Senator", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When he\u2019s not legislating, Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat, is a wheat, barley and alfalfa farmer in Big Sandy, Mont. That makes him a good bet to support President Obama\u2019s trade agenda, which is generally backed by agriculture interests.But before he signs on to anything, Mr. Tester said Tuesday, he wants to see what Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, can come up with in arduous negotiations with Republicans.\u201cOh, he\u2019s important,\u201d Mr. Tester, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said of Mr. Wyden. \u201cHe is the most important person in the caucus on this issue.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s ambitious trade agenda \u2014 once seen as the best chance for bipartisan accomplishment in an otherwise rived Congress \u2014 appears to rest on the narrow, somewhat wobbly shoulders of Mr. Wyden, a position acknowledged by both parties and the White House with some trepidation.\u201cI\u2019m not going to offer some self-promotional comment,\u201d Mr. Wyden said, happy to be in the spotlight but shuffling nervously in the glare on his tall, thin frame. \u201cBut as the ranking Democrat, what I\u2019ve tried to do is work closely with all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put in place what I call \u2018trade done right.\u2019\u201dThe trade deal sought by the Obama administration, the Trans Pacific Partnership, would be the largest accord since the North American Free Trade Agreement went into force in 1994. It would bind 12 nations along the Pacific Rim to a new economic regime with lower trade barriers; fortified protections for workers, the environment and corporate secrets; and new rules to govern the integration of state-owned companies into the global economy.But even before it is completed, the deal is being challenged, largely by the president\u2019s own party.Mr. Wyden, whose interest in trade stems from his own export-focused state, has found himself trying to thread a maddeningly narrow needle with proposals that would placate Democrats who worry that any such deal will hasten the loss of United States manufacturing jobs while assuring Republicans that he is not undermining the free flow of global commerce.On the heels of that deal, Mr. Obama would like to negotiate a second multilateral trade accord with Europe.But before any of that can happen, the White House, its trading partners and most congressional leaders say Congress must pass so-called trade promotion authority, which would let Mr. Obama reach those agreements knowing that Congress can approve or reject them \u2014 but cannot amend them.Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, says he cannot go forward with such \u201cfast track\u201d authority until the Senate can produce a bipartisan version. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Finance Committee, says he cannot produce one without the support of his committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Mr. Wyden.Mr. Wyden is no stranger to controversy. He has long seen himself as a bridge between the parties. He teamed up with Mr. Ryan on an overhaul of Medicare ahead of the 2012 elections, enraging fellow Democrats. He tried to forge bipartisan comity with an approach to universal health care that broke with the Democratic leadership but also with most Republicans. He drafted, then redrafted, tax reform plans with successive Republican partners.But none of those idiosyncratic efforts got anywhere close to becoming law. This time, leaders in both parties need him to succeed.From his position in the driver\u2019s seat, Mr. Wyden is putting demands on the fast-track bill that Republicans are not sure they can accept \u2014 most important, a shut-off valve that Congress could turn if the details of the Pacific or European accords did not live up to their promise.\u201cRight now it\u2019s kind of stuck because I think some of the Democrats want things that we just can\u2019t give them,\u201d Mr. Hatch said on Tuesday.The Obama administration and Republican negotiators say they have bent over backward to win Mr. Wyden\u2019s support.\u201cPresident Obama and Senator Wyden share the common goal of ensuring that America\u2019s workers and businesses are made stronger through our trade agreements,\u201d said Brandi Hoffine, a White House spokeswoman. \u201cThe president greatly appreciates Senator Wyden\u2019s leadership on this issue and his commitment to reaching consensus on trade agreements that set new, higher standards for labor and environmental protections and offer even greater opportunities for American workers to get good-paying jobs and American businesses to expand into new markets.\u201dThe trade promotion bill under negotiation would direct the administration to pursue trade agreements that set tough new standards on labor, the environment, intellectual property, agriculture and state-owned enterprises. It would also include new requirements for congressional and public access to documents before, during and after trade talks.Republicans are also considering including mandated congressional consultations with the administration on international currency manipulation, changing the trade negotiation objectives to include human rights, creating a chief transparency officer at the White House trade office and imposing mandatory timelines for submitting the trade agreements to Congress and the public.But Mr. Wyden remains unsatisfied, both with the Obama administration and his Republican counterparts. Anti-trade activists have protested at his home in Portland, disrupted town hall meetings and called for someone to challenge him in the Democratic primary next year. Republicans have openly blamed him for the current impasse.\u201cIf you believe deeply in trade as I do and you want more of it, it doesn\u2019t make sense to have all this secrecy that makes the public cynical about what\u2019s going on,\u201d Mr. Wyden said in a shot at the White House, which has kept the details of the Pacific trade deal close to the vest.Mr. Wyden said he would not negotiate in public, but aides familiar with his position say he remains adamant that if the president brings forward a trade deal that falls short of the standards expected by lawmakers, Congress should be able to suspend trade-promotion authority so members can amend it. Republicans say just the possibility of a fast-track shut-off would greatly diminish the trade deals under negotiation.\u201cIt\u2019s crucial to be able to tell your negotiating partner if they put their last best offer on the table, that Congress will not either disregard the agreement or amend it,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and a United States trade representative in George W. Bush\u2019s White House. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go through the political pain once, then have the rug pulled out from under them.\u201dBut pro-trade Democrats say the White House and Republicans have to come toward Mr. Wyden. In the past, trade deals could pass on the strength of overwhelming Republican support, supplemented by a minority of Democrats.This time around, a new dynamic has developed. Hard-core conservative Republicans who might have supported trade legislation are opposing it simply because they oppose anything that would grant Mr. Obama more power. That means more Democratic support will be needed, Mr. Wyden\u2019s first and foremost.\u201cThis is all about building consensus and building support,\u201d said Representative Ron Kind of Wisconsin, chairman of the New Democrat Coalition, a group of pro-business Democrats. \u201cGetting Ron Wyden on board is important not just in the Senate but in the House.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misquoted Senator Tester on the importance of Senator Wyden in trade negotiations. He called Mr. Wyden \u201cthe most important person in the caucus on this issue,\u201d not \u201cthe most important person in the Congress.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of England Outlines Parameters of 2015 Stress Test", "Date": "2015-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis year\u2019s test is intended to better reflect the global risks and how those would filter through the system, affecting banks\u2019 capital. It will not include a default by Greece, a Greek exit from the eurozone or Britain\u2019s potentially leaving the European Union. The contagion effects that a Greek default might cause, like a liquidity crisis in emerging markets, are taken into account, Bank of England officials said.The purpose of the test is to measure the soundness of Britain\u2019s banks against severe economic and financial market upheavals, as occurred in 2008. The first such stress test by the British central bank, in 2014, focused more on British risks, including the level of indebtedness of British households.Important differences this year include adding an international focus and taking into account what happens to banks\u2019 illiquid or untradable positions under such stresses.Releasing the parameters of its 2015 test, the British central bank said that under certain situations, banks would have to maintain a 4.5 percent common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, and a 3 percent Tier 1 leverage ratio. Both ratios are measures of a bank\u2019s capital.The 2015 version will try to take into account a wider array of global risks, which have risen sharply since the previous evaluation.\u201cBy assessing the resilience of the U.K. banking system against a major external shock, we will improve further our ability to identify vulnerabilities and we will ensure that banks have plans in place to address a wider range of possible stresses,\u201d Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said on Monday in a statement.The stress test is not a forecast, but a way to measure banks against unlikely but severe events.The testing model envisions growth in China\u2019s gross domestic product falling to about 1.6 percent, from 7 percent; the British economy contracting 2.3 percent, with unemployment spiking to 9.3 percent; growth in global G.D.P. dropping by 0.7 percent; and the Bank of England\u2019s lowering benchmark interest rates to zero from the current 0.5 percent rate.Among the conditions imagined in the test, liquidity in the market is impaired as investors race to dump risky assets and buy high-quality ones in the United States. This causes an appreciation of the dollar and a devaluation of other currencies, including the Chinese renminbi.Lenders are also required to test how they would react if five other major banks defaulted.In the euro area, the test model imagines weaker demand and falling commodity prices leading to an increase in the rate of deflation. Emerging markets would then suffer, slowing capital inflows and leading to a sharp contraction of domestic credit and demand. In Britain, consumption and investment fall. Residential property prices decline 20 percent and commercial property drops 35 percent.The banks are to publish their results in December. Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander UK and Standard Chartered will take part. The Co-operative Bank will not, as it is no longer considered systemically significant.Advertisement"}

Other measures include a promise to make the tax structure more transparent and a commitment to introduce a new bankruptcy law in Parliament that would give businesses more certainty.Mr. Modi made a commitment to give more authority to the states and to provide them with 42 percent of tax revenues compared with 32 percent now, which could give them more reason to work with the federal government on economic reform initiatives. There is no guarantee that states will spend this money wisely, so Mr. Modi will have to monitor the process closely.The economic climate also enabled Mr. Modi to avoid some spending cuts and relax by one year the target, which the government endorsed last year, for reducing the country\u2019s fiscal deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product. A more serious weakness is the budget\u2019s failure to make significant changes to India\u2019s enormous subsidy programs for food, fuel and fertilizer. Opportunity and growth have been stifled by an economy that is centrally directed, overburdened by regulation and plagued by inefficient distribution of aid to the poor. For decades, Indian leaders have promised reform without actually effecting change. Now, a growing population of young people desperate for jobs makes that challenge inescapable. Even many Indians who are not Mr. Modi\u2019s allies are embracing these economic goals and hoping the government carries them out. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Regulatory Advances, Experts Say Risk Remains a Danger to Large Banks", "Date": "2015-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewWith all the new laws and regulations since the financial crisis, it would be easy to believe that the banking industry is safer. Unfortunately, speakers at the Federal Reserve conference at George Washington University on Friday offered a range of reasons for why that\u2019s not the case.First, the regulatory framework remains fragmented. Not only do we have \u201ca dual state and federal banking charter system,\u201d as former Representative Barney Frank told the audience of regulators, bankers, lobbyists, consultants and academics, we also have three national bank regulators, 50 state bank regulators and two derivatives regulators, not to mention different regulators for securities, broker-dealers and insurance companies. Private equity and hedge funds remain largely unregulated. It is unreasonable to expect that all these entities would communicate, not to mention work well together, to detect the next crisis.In his keynote speech, the former Federal Reserve chairman, Paul A. Volcker, said that he continued to ask people \u201cif they like our regulatory system \u2014 and cannot find anyone who does.\u201d He said that he and his research group, the Volcker Alliance, \u201cwill propose that the U.S. regulatory framework be streamlined,\u201d but added that the proposal was likely to meet significant resistance from both the regulatory agencies and politicians, who all have a stake in the current structure.Lack of openness throughout the financial sector, not just in banking, was also a significant problem that led to the crisis and will continue to thwart regulators in years to come. \u201cDuring the crisis, it was very difficult to get access to information,\u201d said Coryann Stefansson, managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cIt is a myth that you can get everything from a bank.\u201dBut while the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has revised its requirements for important bank risks disclosures, they are unlikely to go into effect until next year in the 28 member countries \u2014 and even then, enforcement will not be necessarily uniform.And in the United States, a significant number of financial institutions that are not banks do not report financial data to the Treasury\u2019s new Financial Stability Oversight Council. Among those who do report, reporting is not done in a uniform manner, which would enable regulators to have a consistent view of risk in the system. Current political pressure to raise the $50 billion asset threshold above which banks face greater regulatory scrutiny may make it harder to see how complex and interconnected some firms are.At the conference, Paul Saltzman, president of the Clearing House Association, a trade group, said that bank stress tests were \u201can important Federal Reserve Bank regulatory tool.\u201dBut many of those looking at the results from the latest stress tests and Comprehensive Capital Assessment Review were most interested in whether banks could pay dividends. In the meantime, they were not looking at how the tests depended on unreliable, inaccurate data that rendered capital ratios, living wills data and stress test numbers meaningless. For two decades, I have seen banks of every size struggling with data collection, validation, ratio calculations and use of models. Unfortunately, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision confirmed my concerns in January. Its survey results showed that nearly seven years after the global financial crisis, banks\u2019 technology is not robust enough to give risk managers and regulators a full view of how a bank is coping with its credit, market, operational and liquidity risks.Another significant problem is that many of the systemically important banks have not changed structurally. Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., a law professor at George Washington University, told conference attendees that even though \u201creturns on equity for most large global banks are well below 10 percent,\u201d banks like Goldman and JPMorgan Chase \u201care not changing their business models.\u201d In fact, some banks like Citibank are increasing their risk exposures. \u201cCitibank has increased its footprint in derivatives and commodities,\u201d he said. \u201cCiti does not have a good track record in trading.\u201dUnfortunately, large banks remain insufficiently capitalized to sustain unexpected losses, which could affect ordinary taxpayers. Anat R. Admati, a finance professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, said at the event that banks were \u201cnot the only risk takers in our economy,\u201d adding, \u201cEntrepreneurs in Silicon Valley take risks all the time.\u201d Yet those entrepreneurs, unlike big banks, will not be bailed out by taxpayers, who share in banks\u2019 downside but not in their upsides. Additionally, as Professor Admati said, \u201cCapital ratios and stress tests are based on risk weights and complex models, which can have perverse effects such as biasing banks\u2019 decisions away from worthy business lending and which can increase the interconnectedness and fragility of the system.\u201dProfessor Admati said she was also concerned about how much market participants and even regulators \u201cknow about banks\u2019 interconnections to each other and the extent of their derivatives positions.\u201dThis unanswered question is what concerns financial reformers \u2014 and if taxpayers could learn about banks\u2019 activities, it would worry them as well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hostility From U.S. as China Lures Allies to New Bank", "Date": "2015-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDiplomatic MemoBEIJING \u2014 When Xi Jinping, then the newly minted Chinese leader, first broached the idea of a new Asian development bank in a public speech in 2013, few in Washington paid it much heed.\u201cThe administration made a major mistake in its opposition. It was a very shortsighted,\u201d said Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing. \u201cThe bank was going to go ahead whether we supported it or not.\u201dThe United States would have been wiser, he and others said, to temper its resentment of China\u2019s efforts to raise its international profile and play a bigger role in global financial affairs. Some argue it may also have sought to play a role in an Asia-focused bank led by China, just as Washington expects China to contribute more to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the Washington-based lending agencies for development and monetary stability.The willingness of Britain to join the China bank over American objections was an especially clear sign of China\u2019s sophisticated strategy for winning friends, and Washington\u2019s failure to respond effectively.The British chancellor, George Osborne, had made clear his desire to change Britain\u2019s attitude toward China. The Chinese knew that he wanted to make London a platform for overseas business transacted in Chinese currency, a first step to the convertibility of the renminbi. Just two weeks after Mr. Xi\u2019s speech on the bank, which the Chinese leader delivered in Indonesia, Mr. Osborne visited Beijing, where the courting began.The confluence of Chinese and British interests led to Mr. Osborne\u2019s announcement last week that Britain would become a founding member of the bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. American opposition was made clear, but most likely came late in the process.The British decision cleared the way for other European allies that China had courted to go Beijing\u2019s way, as well. Australia is expected to sign up in the next week, according to government officials, and South Korea is likely to follow.Speaking of Britain, an angry senior administration official told The Financial Times that the decision to join the bank was one more sign of \u201cconstant accommodation\u201d of China.One problem is that Washington did not offer much of an alternative to China\u2019s call to inject far more funding into building roads, railroads and pipelines around Asia, much of which remains underdeveloped. There is little dispute, Mr. Haenle said, that the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have been unable to fulfill the infrastructure needs in the region.\u201cBut there is a strain in Washington that if the U.S. is not in the lead, then the U.S. should not be part of it,\u201d he said.Early on, the United States should have realized that China was determined to create the bank, and that Washington should have tried to influence its creation rather than block it, analysts in Washington and Asia said.China was upset that after the 2008 financial crisis, Congress rebuffed legislation intended to increase Beijing\u2019s voice in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Now that China was sitting on more than $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, Beijing could easily afford to finance an entirely new institution that would have a majority Chinese stake with other countries as minority shareholders, they said.Moreover, China had decided that it wanted to use its excess capacity in steel, concrete and pipes to build up neighboring economies and benefit the Chinese economy, said Laurence J. Brahm, an American who worked with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji on China\u2019s entry to the World Trade Organization in 2001.\u201cChina\u2019s economy will benefit from the export of its own labor to build the infrastructure in the region,\u201d he said.That China would use the bank for its own pet projects in Asia and try to knit together the poorer countries of Southeast and Central Asia into an economic sphere of influence was one of the main worries in Washington.Even so, the administration could have adopted a positive approach. It had the option of agreeing that investing in infrastructure was needed in Asia, and that China, flush with cash, had the ability to fill the gap, said Matthew Goodman, senior adviser on Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.From that more supportive position, Washington would have been in a better position to try to shape the new bank\u2019s rules on lending, the environment and transparency, he said.China\u2019s Finance Ministry has told prospective members that it will strive to make the new bank a first-class operation that will manage to deliver projects more efficiently than the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank.To that end, the Chinese have asked a lawyer who worked at the World Bank for over 30 years, Natalie Lichtenstein, to help prepare the bank\u2019s charter. Such people are important to the bank\u2019s success, said Fred Hu, the founder of Primavera Capital, a private equity firm in Beijing, who early in his career worked at the World Bank. \u201cThe last thing China and A.I.I.B. needs is that some of the fears expressed by Washington are validated,\u201d he said. \u201cAttracting world-class talent is absolutely crucial.\u201d And mindful of reputation, the Finance Ministry has deflected an interest in bank membership from Iran, saying it might consider Iran in a second round, but not as a founding member. No matter how the bank shaped up, it was highly unlikely that the United States would be a member. That was an unfortunate situation, said an Asian diplomat whose country is a founding member.\u201cThe truth is no one in the region wants to choose between the United States and China,\u201d he said. But Washington\u2019s hostility to the bank, he said, made countries choose in China\u2019s favor.Advertisement"}

But I didn\u2019t care.\u201dMs. Chan is one of a number of people seemingly weary of the 24-second cycle of Internet memes, viral distractions and celebrity hearsay that provide the fodder for today\u2019s online intelligentsia. They do not busy themselves keeping up with the online cultural conversation of the moment, and they willingly brave the social cost of seeming out of touch.Kate Unsworth, a designer of wearable tech who splits her time equally between New York and London and who recently disabled the Twitter and Facebook apps on her mobile phone, was befuddled recently when a barista at her East London coffee shop greeted her one morning with the question, \u201cDid you watch it?\u201dMs. Unsworth, 27, had no idea what he was talking about, and she was equally puzzled when he told her he was referring to the third season of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d a show with which she was familiar but hadn\u2019t realized was back online. What\u2019s more, when he mentioned the show again the next morning, to see if she had caught up, she seemed annoyed that he expected her to be part of his personal binge-watching experience.\u201cHow did this make it into our daily conversation?\u201d she said. \u201cI see him every morning, but he is not a friend.\u201dIt has also, she contends, made her more aware than many of her peers of what\u2019s going on outside the world of E! and TMZ. \u201cIn this day and age, it is expected that you know all the unnecessary tidbits,\u201d she said. \u201cBut ask people what they think about death, the process of birth or the caste system in India, and they have no idea what to think.\u201d(Ms. Feingold has not gone cold turkey, however: She has a friend who texts her the latest pop culture news that she thinks Ms. Feingold needs to know about, like Kim Kardashian dyeing her hair blond.)Some researchers suggest that the desire to opt out is a backlash to the \u201cfear of missing out,\u201d or FOMO, a term dating to around 2011 that described the anxiety people felt reading on social media about parties they were not invited to attend.FOMO was followed by another putative trend, the \u201cjoy of missing out,\u201d which extolled mindfulness and staying offline to snuggle on the couch instead.

{"Headline": "Modi Sees Shiny Cities in India\u2019s Future", "Date": "2015-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From IndiaNEW DELHI \u2014 If all goes according to plan in a city that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is building, human excrement will travel faster than most Indian trains. This is either an indication of how advanced Mr. Modi\u2019s vision is or how backward Indian reality is.The project in question is a \u201csmart city,\u201d a concept that is very dear to Mr. Modi and unclear to Indians who have tried to find out what exactly it does. A smart city, it appears from the government\u2019s sketches, is a cluster of high-rise buildings that shine in daylight and glow at night, and loom over waterways and handsome trains that have automatic doors. A smart city would be run and managed by software that would, among other things, suck human waste from buildings and send it at high speed to some other place.Mr. Modi plans to build scores of smart cities and hundreds of other cities that are only marginally dumber. He also wants to develop many industries.He wants the world to \u201cmake in India.\u201d India\u2019s chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian, has conveyed to him the hypothesis that agriculture is useless in enriching Indians. The economy should instead focus on providing low-skilled manufacturing jobs to absorb millions of poor young Indians who are fit to work.To achieve all this, Mr. Modi\u2019s government needs a lot of land from Indian farmers. It is a messy process. He appears to know how messy it can be. Once, in a speech to Delhi\u2019s elite, he expressed his amusement at the memory of a bunch of automobile executives who went to acquire land from farmers, \u201cwearing ties and suits.\u201d They were driven away.He is pushing legislation that would make it easier to acquire land for public and private projects. There is much political and intellectual opposition to this, because it would be a potent and transformative measure.Historically, when Indian governments have set out to acquire land, they have been viewed as corrupt and exploitative, the pimps of private firms. Something inside farmers, humanitarians, political economists and tradition lovers combusts at the combination of the words \u201cland\u201d and \u201cacquisition.\u201d The previous government passed an act in 2013 that would require the consent of 70 percent to 80 percent of landowners, depending on what the land was to be used for, before any acquisition by the government or a private company. The act also mandated an assessment of the project\u2019s impact on those who are not the owners of the land but are dependent on it.The Modi government is attempting to amend this act. For some types of projects, the government wants to eliminate the requirement for the consent of landowners and the impact assessment. This would speed up land acquisition. At the heart of the new bill is the notion that few Indians want to be farmers anymore and that landless farm laborers are better off working in the new economies that the new projects would create.Indian agriculture, despite all the homage that is paid by city dwellers to farmers, is mostly land aspiring to become real estate. Farming is the least productive industry in India, and farmers are among its most impoverished laborers, even though the sheer size of India and the fact that more than 60 percent of its land is used for farming ensure that it is a statistical giant in agriculture.The intellectuals and activists who oppose the government\u2019s plans for efficient land acquisition despise the idea that anyone should be forced to sell his land and that hundreds of thousands of landless farmworkers should suddenly be asked to choose another profession. They accuse the government of being the enemy of the poor farmer. But it appears that Mr. Modi\u2019s instinct tells him he has much to gain from those sketches of big gleaming things coming to life.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is the Next \u2018Next Silicon Valley\u2019?", "Date": "2015-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCivic Boosters\u201cNerds love Orlando,\u201d according to public relations materials I received this week from the city of Orlando, Fla. But as Orlando seeks to rebrand itself as \u201ca high tech hub for innovation,\u201d it faces a lot of competition.For its part, Orlando brags it was named a \u201cpromising tech hub to watch\u201d in 2014 by Techie.com. If you hadn\u2019t heard of Techie.com, don\u2019t worry, neither had I; the tech site, based in South Bend, Ind., folded a few months ago, but not before it awarded the \u201cpromising tech hub\u201d distinction to Orlando along with Minneapolis, Detroit, Champaign-Urbana, Ill., and Sioux Falls, S.D.The hard data does not bear out the proposition that nerds love Orlando. They do not love Las Vegas, and they are lukewarm about Chicago. Research from the Brookings Institution, based on figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, tells a rather more conventional story: Nerds love Silicon Valley. Among the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States, San Jose, Calif., ranks first in \u201cadvanced industry\u201d employment as a share of total employment. Orlando ranks 73rd \u2014 and places 78th in advanced industry employment growth from 2010 to 2013.The gap between San Jose and the No. 2 metro area is large. Seattle, no tech slouch with Microsoft, Amazon, Zillow and others, has 16 percent of its work force in advanced industry compared with 30 percent for San Jose.The Progressive Policy Institute puts out its own \u201ctech/info jobs index,\u201d which uses a narrower definition of the high-tech sector, but it produces broadly similar results: The three large counties showing the strongest gain in tech jobs from 2009 to 2013 were San Francisco, Santa Clara and San Mateo \u2014 the three counties at the core of Northern California\u2019s tech industry cluster. Orange County, Fla., which contains Orlando, scored 89th out of 214. (The index compares tech jobs added to the overall job base, so it doesn\u2019t discriminate in favor of places with high total populations.)The other model for competing with Silicon Valley is about cross-industry collaboration. Michael Mandel, the chief economic strategist at P.P.I., notes that strong growth in New York\u2019s tech industry has helped soften the blow from the financial crisis. Its numbers show New York gained almost 28,000 jobs, about what Santa Clara County, Calif., did.\u201cWhat you had was the intermix between the content hub and the tech hub that turned out to create a lot of job gain,\u201d Mr. Mandel said. That is, New York is not a broad-spectrum competitor to Silicon Valley, but is seeing extensive growth in areas of the tech industry that benefit from exposure to other industries with a large concentration in New York, especially media, but also fashion and finance.What New York and Provo have in common is they provide not just the resources necessary to start a high-tech business, but also the impetus to keep it there once it succeeds. In the Provo (or Boulder) example, the businesses stay local because the owners and the workers really want to live there. (This is something else Silicon Valley has always had going for it.) In the New York example, they stay local because the location provides an irreplaceable business advantage.Mr. Florida pointed to Pittsburgh as a cautionary example. He used to teach at Carnegie Mellon, a top research university that produces a lot of graduates capable of starting and staffing great technology companies. But start-ups that spin out of Carnegie Mellon have neither a strong lifestyle reason nor a strong economic reason to stay in Pittsburgh once they succeed. \u201cIf there was a successful start-up, eventually it got sucked into the Silicon Valley vortex,\u201d he said.So, what lessons does this provide for someplace like Orlando, if it wants to shift its economy toward high tech?\u201cI think what Orlando has is a combination of the space stuff and the Disney stuff,\u201d Mr. Florida said. \u201cIt\u2019s not trivial, those things taken together, but it\u2019s hard to see how you put them together.\u201dLocal officials point to one way they might. Orlando is a center for modeling and simulation technology, because flight simulators and theme park rides can rely on a lot of the same technology. Tourism isn\u2019t generally thought of as a tech-intensive field, but Disney recently developed its MyMagic Plus system (waterproof wristbands with RFID chips that give visitors access to rides and unlock their hotel room doors) in-house in Orlando.Still, tourism is heavily dispersed geographically, and while there are a lot of tourism dollars in Orlando, even Disney is not headquartered there. Companies that produce technology for the hospitality industry do not need to cluster in Orlando.\u201cI would say, over all, this is a relatively thin backdrop,\u201d said Mark Muro, the researcher behind the Brookings report, after examining his own figures about industry concentration in Orlando, which show few high-tech specialties. \u201cBut I would note it is possible to diversify, starting from nothing.\u201dIt is also possible to set more modest goals.

In the absence of a federal policy, the biggest and wealthiest companies are performing the role of setting workplace policy for other businesses.As the economy has become more dependent on contract workers, workers\u2019 rights advocates have voiced concern about their working conditions, especially for low-skilled jobs.The situation is particularly acute in the tech industry, where average full-time employees earn more than $115,000 a year, along with generous benefits like child care, gourmet cafeterias and luxury shuttle rides to work. Many of the contracted service workers \u2014 who take care of the children, cook the food or drive the shuttles \u2014 earn near poverty-level wages and often do not receive basic benefits like sick leave.After pressure from contract workers and labor groups, other tech companies have also made changes. Apple and Google hired security guards as full-time employees instead of contractors, for instance, and Facebook agreed to a new contract with substantial raises after its shuttle drivers unionized.Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft\u2019s general counsel, said the company was in part responding to complaints from contract employees who worked alongside full-time employees but did not have the same benefits.More broadly, he said, Microsoft decided it was necessary given the company\u2019s dependence on contractors. \u201cThe research shows that employees who do get these kinds of benefits are far likelier to be happier, have higher morale and are far more likely to be productive,\u201d he said.\u201cIf people are sick,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s not necessarily good to have them go to work because they can infect their colleagues.\u201dThe United States is the only advanced economy that does not require paid sick leave, and 43 million workers do not have it, the president said in his address.But an approach like Microsoft\u2019s is much more unusual.\u201cWhen you follow the money, the money comes from the tech companies, so ultimately they could raise the floor for our contract work force,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s a moral model, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a high probability it\u2019s going to become universal through business initiatives,\u201d she said. \u201cThe public wants this. The resistance is all from employers. The only way is through public policy.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s policy will require contractors that employ 50 or more people to provide workers with either 10 paid vacation days and five paid sick days or 15 days of unrestricted paid time off. Only the employees who work with Microsoft will be required to get the leave, if they have worked at the supplier for more than nine months. Mr. Smith said Microsoft expected to pay more for contractors\u2019 services to cover the added costs. (Microsoft\u2019s own employees get 10 sick days and 15 to 25 vacation days, depending on their years at the company.)Mr. Smith said the company did not know how many contract employees did not already have paid sick leave.The contractors at Microsoft and many big companies include highly paid engineers, marketers and lawyers as well as lower-paid security guards, cooks and janitors. Professional, educated workers are much more likely to have paid sick leave and other benefits than working-class ones.\u201cAs you get to the lower end of the wage spectrum, it starts to become the exception rather than the norm,\u201d Mr. Smith said.It was first introduced in 2004, and has never made it to the floor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Asia Rushes to Lower Rates, but Maybe Not Fast Enough", "Date": "2015-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Central banks across Asia are racing to cut interest rates, but they may not be doing it fast enough to stave off economic malaise.The problem is weak inflation. Policy makers appear to have been surprised by how slowly prices are rising, and the slowdown is starting to weigh on economic growth across the region. If prices drop for too long, companies invest less and people\u2019s pay shrinks.Asia is not experiencing such outright deflation yet, but the risks are rising. Inflation began weakening last year in the region, with the drastic drop in the global prices of oil and other commodities. Those declines now appear to be spreading throughout the Asian economy, and growth is slowing as a result.\u201cAsian central banks in general have been very relaxed in recent years about the economic outlook and risks around price stability,\u201d Frederic Neumann, a head of Asian economic research at HSBC, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. \u201cChina is an obvious example where deflation pressures have taken hold, but if you look everywhere from Korea to Southeast Asia, inflation is coming off much more rapidly than expected.\u201dSouth Korea\u2019s central bank on Thursday reduced its benchmark rate to a low of 1.75 percent, a day after Thailand reduced rates for the first time in a year. Last week, India lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 7.5 percent, with the central bank\u2019s saying the cut, its second between scheduled policy meetings, had been tied to easing inflation and weakness in the economy. In recent months, China has cut interest rates twice and freed its banks to lend more.The rush to lower rates in Asia is notable because the region is breaking with tradition and moving in a direction opposite to that of the United States. With the American economy rebounding smoothly and the job market appearing increasingly healthy, the United States Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising interest rates. In previous years, many central banks in Asia have tended to align their monetary policy with the Fed\u2019s.That they are now moving in the opposite direction \u201cbrings home the strength of the disinflationary force that\u2019s gripping Asia,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cIt\u2019s relentless.\u201d\u201cThere must be prudence,\u201d Mr. Zhou said to reporters in Beijing on Thursday. The bank\u2019s actions so far, he said, were \u201cmaintaining appropriate liquidity in the financial markets, and they haven\u2019t overstepped the bounds.\u201dHis approach, he added, \u201cremains unchanged, as steady and neutral.\u201dIn China\u2019s case, the picture is complicated because the country is still moving forward with several overhauls to its financial system. Mr. Zhou said Thursday that the government would introduce the country\u2019s first deposit insurance program in the coming months.He also reiterated a pledge to deregulate interest rates charged by the country\u2019s banks. Limits on some of those rates have already been lifted, although deposit rates on savings accounts remain capped.In statements released after they moved to cut rates, the central banks of South Korea and Thailand cited the slowdown in China \u2014 previously the main engine of growth in the region and a major trading partner of both countries \u2014 as a reason for their decisions.There are signs that China\u2019s own recent easing actions, which since November have included two interest-rate cuts and a lowering of the amount of cash that banks are required to keep on reserve, have resulted in more lending. China\u2019s new credit growth in February was stronger than economists expected, with new local-currency loans rising 14.3 percent from a year earlier to 1 trillion renminbi, or $165 billion, according to figures released on Thursday.But in China, as with elsewhere in Asia, being too neutral for too long may have led to problems. \u201cIntensified policy easing can help cushion, but unlikely reverse, the downtrend in China\u2019s real economic growth,\u201d Tao Wang, the chief China economist at UBS, wrote Thursday in a research report.Part of the problem is that the real cost of credit in China, after factoring in inflation, remains persistently high despite the recent easing measures.Li-Gang Liu, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, estimates that real borrowing rates for Chinese companies are more than 10 percent a year. That is based on an average bank lending rate of around 7 percent, and includes producer price inflation of around 4 percent.Many companies in China have turned to even more expensive borrowing from the country\u2019s sprawling shadow banking sector, which includes players as diverse as trust companies and online lenders. But authorities, worried over spiraling amounts of loosely regulated credit, have been seeking to curtail such lenders.\u201cBank lending is getting more important as shadow banking activities have been cracked down on,\u201d Mr. Liu wrote in an email. \u201cBanks have become more risk averse in lending to trust companies, and shadow banking financing has dropped.\u201dAnd then there is the uncertainty that could be introduced by the Fed. Rising interest rates in the United States and falling rates in Asia raise the risk that Asian nations could begin to see a shifting away of foreign currency. In China, there have been signs in recent months that this is taking place, as locals sell renminbi for dollars and move money offshore.Mr. Zhou, the Chinese central bank governor, said this was to be expected if the Fed raised rates. \u201cPeople in the financial markets may certainly consider now whether to buy more dollars, or to have some dollars stored abroad.\u201d\u201cBut the signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve are that this move will be quite cautious and prudent,\u201d he said of the anticipated rate increase. \u201cSo from what we can see for now, we believe that this doesn\u2019t constitute a huge threat.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Costa Rica", "Date": "2015-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real EstateThis steel-frame house, with four bedrooms and five bathrooms, is perched on a steep hillside near Manuel Antonio National Park, one of the most popular tourist destinations in Costa Rica.A FOUR-BEDROOM HOUSE WITH VIEWS OF JUNGLE AND OCEAN$2,390,000The living area in the steel-frame house encompasses about 5,000 square feet, including covered balconies. There are four bedrooms and five bathrooms, with wide terraces accessible from almost every room and offering views of the Pacific Ocean. The front door leads to an open-design living area, dining area and kitchen. The flooring is ceramic tile. The furniture is included in the price. The kitchen has granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, a pantry and large windows with ocean views.Large windows frame the living area, offering unobstructed jungle and ocean views. It has overhead fans, but no air-conditioning, a common arrangement in Costa Rica. (There are air-conditioning units in the bedrooms.) Outside is a long open-air deck with a narrow plunge pool. Monkeys, sloths and exotic birds are regular visitors, according to Dave Houck, an owner of Tulemar Vacation Home Rentals and Sales. The top floor, accessible by a floating wood staircase, has two master bedroom suites and an office. One master bedroom features a bathroom with twin sinks and a whirlpool bathtub; the bathroom off the other bedroom has a shower with a glass door leading to the balcony. The office has a built-in wood desk and storage space; Wi-Fi is available throughout the house. All the rooms on this level access wide terraces with jungle and ocean views.The remaining two bedrooms are on the bottom floor, each with its own bathroom, tile shower and deck. The two lower bedrooms also share a small kitchenette with a refrigerator. The house sits on a lot of about two-thirds of an acre, which includes a wide, flat grassy area that has been used as a croquet court. There is no garage, but there is a storage area under the house, Mr. Houck said. Within the Tulemar development, 45 homes have been completed. Amenities include two restaurants, four pools, resort shuttles and a concierge service. The homeowners\u2019 association fee is $600 a month.Tulemar is off a narrow, winding, two-lane mountain road, about halfway between the small fishing town of Quepos and the national park. It is within walking distance of a cluster of restaurants, open-air bars and a small market. Most people reach the area by driving from San Jos\u00e9, which takes about four hours, or by flying into Quepos on one of the small Costa Rica airlines, which is a 25-minute trip. The house has been on the market for several months, but the price has not been lowered and the owners are in no rush to sell, Mr. Houck said. They rent it out for most of the year, typically for $6,500 a week during high season, from January to April, and as high as $13,000 a week during Christmas and New Year\u2019s, Mr. Houck said. \u201cThere is a very strong following of repeat guests,\u201d Mr. Houck said. MARKET OVERVIEWThere is no multiple listing service or central database in Costa Rica, making it difficult to find accurate information on sales and pricing. When the international second home market stalled in 2008, sales in the Manuel Antonio area slowed to a trickle and prices dropped 20 to 30 percent, according to agents.But activity has been picking up in the past year. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely having an uptick in sales,\u201d said Shawn Ferguson, co-owner of the Coldwell Banker office in Manuel Antonio and Quepos, a real estate agency. The market is very dependent on the United States economy, which generates the largest group of buyers. \u201cWe\u2019re probably six to eight months behind the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. \u201cAs the U.S. heads up, so do we.\u201dThe bulk of recent activity involves bargain homes priced below $350,000 and luxury properties priced over $800,000, according to agents. Investors are primarily interested in the higher-end villas to rent to tourists as vacation homes. \u201cLess than $800,000 and they are not going to get the amenities they need\u201d for a prime rental, Mr. Ferguson said.All the original lots in Tulemar have been sold, but typically there are five to seven homes and lots available on the resale market, Mr. Houck said. When the market collapsed, Tulemar \u201cdidn\u2019t sell as many properties, but prices didn\u2019t drop,\u201d Mr. Houck said. The least expensive home on the market there is a three-bedroom, 3,000-square-foot home for $799,000. A one-bedroom, 700-square-foot bungalow recently sold for $435,000, Mr. Houck said. WHO BUYS IN COSTA RICANorth Americans looking for a second home or a tropical investment property dominate the Costa Rica market, according to agents. The largest number of buyers comes from the West Coast of the United States, with Canadians a close second. Air connections from Europe are slowly improving, bringing more tourists from Italy, Germany and Britain. Costa Rica is famous for attracting ecotourists and buyers drawn by its lush landscape and natural beauty. It is also one of the favorite destinations in the region for retirees. The country offers a pensionado visa program with a wide range of discounts and tax breaks for anyone who moves to Costa Rica and can show a minimal income from Social Security or a pension plan. Buyers from around Latin America, including from Colombia and Venezuela, are playing an increasing role, Mr. Ferguson said. His company is changing its marketing strategy to attract more buyers from the region, including a growing class of affluent Costa Rican buyers. BUYING BASICSThere are few restrictions on foreigners buying property. \u201cForeigners have exactly the same rights as a Costa Rican when it comes to buying property,\u201d said Roger Petersen, a San Jos\u00e9-based lawyer who works with property buyers.The only twist involves waterfront property, known as the maritime zone, which is tightly regulated by the Costa Rican government. It can be difficult for a foreigner to buy land in the maritime zone, which extends about 200 meters from the high-tide line, and building or renovating a property can be a complicated process.\u201cAnybody considering investing in properties in the maritime zone needs to do a more extensive due diligence,\u201d Mr. Petersen said.\u00a0Transactions are typically carried out in dollars, and most purchases by foreigners are in cash. Mortgages are difficult for nonresidents to obtain in Costa Rica. Transfer deeds to record the transfer of title must be done in Spanish; purchase agreements are often translated into English, but buyers should carefully review the translation.It is mandatory to use a notary public to complete and record the transaction \u2014 all notaries are also lawyers.Agents recommend that buyers hire their own lawyer, who represents their interests exclusively, with no ties to the seller.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESSpanish; col\u00f3n (1 col\u00f3n = $0.0019), with the United States dollar widely accepted.TAXES AND FEESTransaction fees for a purchase typically total about 3.5 percent of its value, Mr. Petersen said. Although the buyer usually pays the fees, sometimes sellers may agree to split the costs to close a deal.Property taxes are calculated as 0.25 percent of the tax value of the property. In 2009, the government implemented a \u201cluxury\u201d tax on homes with a construction value of more than about $250,000 (on the structure, not including the land). The formula is complicated, but typically adds another 0.25 percent, Mr. Petersen said. There is no capital gains tax for individual sellers.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netanyahu Soundly Defeats Chief Rival in Israeli Elections", "Date": "2015-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith 99.5 percent of the ballots counted, the YNet news site reported Wednesday morning that Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party had captured 29 or 30 of the 120 seats in Parliament, sweeping past his chief rival, the center-left Zionist Union alliance, which got 24 seats.Mr. Netanyahu and his allies had seized on earlier exit polls that showed a slimmer Likud lead to create an aura of inevitability, and celebrated with singing and dancing. While his opponents vowed a fight, Israeli political analysts agreed even before most of the ballots were counted that he had the advantage, with more seats having gone to the right-leaning parties likely to support him.Mr. Netanyahu, who served as prime minister for three years in the 1990s and returned to office in 2009, exulted in what he called \u201ca huge victory\u201d and said he had spoken to the heads of all the parties \u201cin the national camp\u201d and urged them to help him form a government \u201cwithout any further ado.\u201d\u201cI am proud of the Israeli people that, in the moment of truth, knew how to separate between what\u2019s important or what\u2019s not and to stand up for what\u2019s important,\u201d he told an exuberant crowd early Wednesday morning at Likud\u2019s election party at the Tel Aviv Fairgrounds. \u201cFor the most important thing for all of us, which is real security, social economy and strong leadership.\u201dBut it remained to be seen how his divisive \u2014 some said racist \u2014 campaign tactics would affect his ability to govern a fractured Israel.Mr. Herzog also called the election \u201can incredible achievement.\u201d He said he had formed a negotiating team and still hoped to lead \u201ca real social government in Israel\u201d that \u201caspires to peace with our neighbors.\u201d\u201cThe public wants a change,\u201d he said at an election-night party in Tel Aviv, before the Likud\u2019s large margin of victory was revealed by the actual vote count. \u201cWe will do everything in our power, given the reality, to reach this. In any case, I can tell you that there will be no decisions tonight.\u201dBased on the results reported on YNet, Mr. Netanyahu could form a narrow coalition of nationalist and religious parties free of the ideological divisions that stymied his last government. That was what he intended when he called early elections in December. President Reuven Rivlin, who in coming days must charge Mr. Netanyahu or Mr. Herzog with trying to forge a coalition based on his poll of party leaders\u2019 preferences , said shortly after the polls closed that he would suggest they join forces instead.\u201cI am convinced that only a unity government can prevent the rapid disintegration of Israel\u2019s democracy and new elections in the near future,\u201d he told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.Both camps rejected that option publicly, saying the gaps between their world views were too large. Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Herzog started working the phones immediately after the polls closed, calling party heads to begin the horse-trading and deal-making in hopes of lining up a majority of lawmakers behind them.Kulanu \u2014 Hebrew for \u201cAll of Us\u201d \u2014 won 10 seats , according to the tally YNet reported Wednesday based on 99.5 percent of ballots counted. That is enough to put either side\u2019s basic ideological alliance over the magic number of 61 if they also win the backing of two ultra-Orthodox parties that won a total of 14 seats.Silvan Shalom, a Likud minister, told reporters that the prime minister would reach out first to Naftali Bennett of the Jewish Home party and to Avigdor Lieberman of Yisrael Beiteinu, two archconservatives, and \u201cof course Moshe Kahlon,\u201d predicting a coalition \u201cwithin the next few days\u201d of 63 or 64 seats.\u201cIsrael said today a very clear \u2018yes\u2019 to Prime Minister Netanyahu and to the Likud to continue leading the State of Israel,\u201d Mr. Shalom said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it with our allies. We\u2019ll have a strong coalition that is able to deal with all the important issues.\u201dThe Zionist Union said, essentially, not so fast.Nachman Shai, a senior lawmaker from the Labor Party, which joined with the smaller Hatnua to form the new slate, said Mr. Herzog could still form a coalition, thought he did not specify how, and advised the public to \u201cwait and see.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re trying to cash the check and create a certain atmosphere of victory,\" Mr. Shai told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the same.\u201dThe murky exit-poll predictions led to a murky reaction from the White House, where a spokesman said that President Obama remained \u201ccommitted to working very closely with the winner of the ongoing elections to cement and further deepen the strong relationship between the United States and Israel, and the president is confident that he can do that with whomever the Israeli people choose.\u201dThe Joint List of Arab parties won 13 seats, making it the third-largest parliamentary faction. Its four component parties previously had 11.The unity seems to have lifted turnout among Arab voters to its highest level since 1969, said the list\u2019s leader, Ayman Odeh. Arab parties have never joined an Israeli coalition, but Mr. Odeh has indicated that he would try to help Mr. Herzog in other ways in hopes of ending Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s tenure.Yesh Atid, a centrist party that won a surprising 19 seats in the 2013 election, its first, earned 11 this time. The Jewish Home lost votes to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s swing to the right and ended up with eight, according to YNet, down from its current 12. The ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu had six, and the leftist Meretz four.A new ultra-Orthodox breakaway faction apparently failed to pass the raised electoral threshold to enter Parliament, which means its votes will be discarded, costing the right-wing bloc.Turnout was near 72 percent, four percentage points higher than in 2013, which analysts attributed to the surprisingly close contest between the Likud and Zionist Union.\u201cFor the first time in many years, we see a serious strengthening in the two major parties,\u201d said Yehuda Ben Meir of the Institute for National Security Studies. \u201cBoth parties are higher up at the expense of the smaller parties, which is good for stability, and it\u2019s a move to the center. The larger parties are always more to the center than the satellite parties.\u201dBut Mr. Plesner of the Democracy Institute said the results showed the need for electoral reform because Israel\u2019s \u201csystem is so fragmented, so unstable, so difficult to govern.\u201dTuesday\u2019s balloting came just 26 months after Israel\u2019s last election, but the dynamic was entirely different. In 2013, there was no serious challenge to Mr. Netanyahu. This time, Mr. Herzog teamed up with Tzipi Livni to form the Zionist Union, an effort to reclaim the state\u2019s founding pioneer philosophy from a right-wing that increasingly defines it in opposition to Palestinian national aspirations.They promised to stop construction in isolated Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, to try to renew negotiations with the Palestinians, and to restore relations Mr. Netanyahu had frayed with the White House. Mostly, though, they \u2014 along with Yesh Atid and Kulanu \u2014 hammered the prime minister on kitchen-table concerns like the high cost of housing and food.Mr. Netanyahu talked mainly about the threats of an Iranian nuclear weapon and Islamic terrorism, addressing economics only in the final days. That was also when he made a sharp turn to the right, backing away from his 2009 endorsement of a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict and sounding an alarm Tuesday morning that Arabs were voting \u201cin droves.\u201dMany voters complained about a bitter campaign of ugly attacks and a lack of inspiring choices.\u201cI am happy today to be able to vote, but I know I\u2019ll be unhappy with the result, no matter who wins,\u201d said Elad Grafi, 29, who lives in Rehovot, a large city south of Tel Aviv. Sneering at the likelihood of any candidate being able to form a coalition stable enough to last a full term, he added, \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll see you here again in two years, right?\u201dIn the Jerusalem suburb of Tzur Hadassah, Eli Paniri, 54, a longtime Likud supporter, said he \u201cvoted for the only person who should be prime minister: Netanyahu.\u201d\u201cI am not ashamed of this,\u201d Mr. Paniri said after weeks of Netanyahu-bashing from all sides. \u201cHe is a strong man and, most important, he stood up to President Obama.\u201dReporting was contributed by Irit Pazner Garshowitz from Tzur Hadassah, Israel, and Tel Aviv; Isabel Kershner, Myra Noveck and Carol Sutherland from Jerusalem; Michael D.

{"Headline": "Cameron Promises Another Dose of Austerity as British Elections Near", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The British election campaign now underway here revolves in large part around a single issue: the economy, and whether its rebound is the result of an austerity policy championed by the Conservative-led government, or in spite of it.Similar questions are being debated throughout Europe, but in the wake of the global recession after the 2008-9 financial crisis, few nations veered more sharply than Britain toward the theory that getting deficits and debt under control was a precondition to a sustained recovery.His platform is being challenged by a broad spectrum of critics. The Church of England, for one, is urging more \u201cmoral authority\u201d and criticizing inequality and low-paying jobs.But the campaign is also focusing attention on key elements of the economic debate: How much austerity did the government actually impose? Is Britain\u2019s recovery a victory for budget cutting, or evidence that the country pulled out of its slump through continued if somewhat lower deficit spending combined with an aggressive effort to keep interest rates low?Despite tough talk from Mr. Cameron and George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, the government continues to spend much more than it takes in. Its budget deficit of 5.5 percent of gross domestic product is considerably higher than that of the supposedly spendthrift Socialist government of France.Mr. Osborne has failed to deliver on two key promises made when he and Mr. Cameron took office five years ago at the head of a coalition with the Liberal Democrats \u2014 to run a cyclically adjusted balanced budget by this year and to begin to shrink Britain\u2019s cumulative government debt.\u201cBy historical standards this has been significant austerity,\u201d said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a nonpartisan research institution that calculates the costs of political promises. \u201cBut despite the rhetoric, it\u2019s not a massive austerity, not compared to Ireland, Spain or Greece.\u201dMr. Osborne, he said, has \u201cnot been quite such an austere chancellor as either his own rhetoric or that of his critics might suggest.\u201dStill, real spending by government departments is down 8 percent from 2010, when the budget deficit was more than 11 percent of G.D.P., a function of the Labour government\u2019s response to the global crash of 2008.Yet because the economy did not grow as much as forecast, limiting tax revenue, the deficit did not fall as much as planned. The government made important reductions, delivering most of the cuts it promised. But those cuts mostly took place in the first two years, until 2012. As economists on both sides point out, the government eased off sharply after that. Austerity was essentially put off \u2014 to a potential second term.\u201cThey were faced with a choice \u2014 to stick to the austerity plan, or to do something economically more sensible \u2014 and they chose the latter,\u201d said Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. \u201cThough I\u2019m not a great fan of this government, they made the right choice, and by comparison to what happened in the eurozone, everyone looks good.\u201dIn that sense, Mr. Cameron and Mr. Osborne have threaded the needle, cutting enough at the start to keep bond holders and core constituents happy, but at the same time, benefiting from a Keynesian recovery, fueled by deficit spending, while making the moral and ideological case that they are reducing the deficit over time.Whatever the cuts so far, Mr. Osborne has vowed to swing a much broader ax to chop back the size of the state, renewing the Thatcher-era belief that a large state sector is wasteful and stifles creativity.Mr. Osborne vows that his last budget before the election, to be delivered Wednesday, will contain \u201cno giveaways, no gimmicks.\u201d He has promised an absolute budget balance by 2019, including investment spending, and a 1 percent surplus by 2020, which will mean a spending cut by government departments of 14 percent in real terms, some 38 billion pounds, over the next five years, a reduction on a scale never before seen.According to Mr. Johnson, Mr. Osborne, by 2019, would bring the state\u2019s share of the economy to its lowest since World War II.The impact, if the budget is adopted, would be substantial. While promising to cut some taxes and protect politically sensitive things like pensions and the National Health Service as well as foreign aid, Mr. Osborne will have to make disproportionate cuts in defense, policing and local government, hard choices in a time of renewed anxiety about security.\u201cMuch low-hanging fruit has already been plucked,\u201d said Ryan Bourne, head of public policy at the right-leaning Institute of Economic Affairs. In his coming budget, Mr. Osborne may use the extra economic growth and the tax revenue it has produced to soften his targets slightly, especially with key Tories pushing to preserve military spending at 2 percent of G.D.P., the NATO guideline.But he will not have much room to maneuver, since he has insisted that he will reach his goals through spending cuts, not tax increases.\u201cIf you really do that,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, \u201cthen the rhetoric begins to match the reality, because you really are beginning to shrink the state.\u201dHe added that he has his doubts: \u201cThe size of the cuts in the nonprotected parts of the budget would be so high I\u2019d be astonished if this happens.\u201d Polling suggests it is unlikely that the Conservatives will win an overall majority in Parliament, even if Mr. Cameron returns as prime minister, limiting their ability to enact their agenda.The Labour Party has been vaguer about its economic plans, while generally committing itself to limit deficits and slow the increase in the public debt. But Labour is in no hurry to get started.Mr. Johnson\u2019s institute published a \u201cgreen budget\u201d comparing the economic plans of the main parties. The differences are clear when it comes to the size of the government, with Labour projecting much less drastic spending cuts of roughly \u00a39 billion over the next five years, less than a quarter of Tory plans.Labour promises a balanced budget on everything except investment in infrastructure, for which Labour would continue to borrow, only by 2020.The Conservatives are playing on voters\u2019 mistrust of Labour\u2019s economic management. They argue that with lower oil prices, stronger demand, lower inflation, more jobs, seven consecutive quarters of growth, and growth of about 3 percent last year, the economy looks pretty good, so why let Labour mess it up again?In fact, the economy has significant problems, with G.D.P. per capita and real wages still lower than they were before the 2008 economic crisis, though household incomes have finally reached the 2008 level. Living standards are down, especially for young people who are getting lower pay and a smaller share of social benefits than their parents. Labor productivity is poor, and Britain is still running a large structural deficit, another indication that austerity has been much milder than in Ireland or Greece.What took everyone by surprise, given the slow turnaround in the economy, has been the rebound in job creation, with unemployment now at 5.8 percent, down from 7.9 percent when the government took office. Yet because most of the new jobs are either part-time or not highly paid, they have produced less tax revenue.With interest rates so low, many economists say it is wrong to worry about adding modest amounts of new debt and to insist on fiscal tightening that imperils the fragile recovery. Yet those who want to push down the debt now argue that if interest rates go up to traditional levels, servicing an increasing amount of debt will be extremely painful.Mr. Johnson said that the cutbacks so far had encouraged the Treasury to push for more. \u201cWe got here with a lot less pain than I and others expected in 2010,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to rein in spending without things falling apart.\u201d At least so far.Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Public Pension Cuts Exempt Police and Firefighters", "Date": "2015-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisIn recent weeks, Gov. Bruce Rauner of Illinois has traveled the state promoting his proposal for more than $2 billion in cuts to pensions for public employees. All public employees, that is, except police officers and firefighters.By announcing the exemption, Mr. Rauner was following the lead of other Republican governors in the Midwest who have imposed unwelcome changes on state and local employees in the name of saving money and improving services.In 2012, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan signed a right-to-work bill, eliminating the requirement that private and public sector workers contribute dues to the unions that represent them, whether or not they are members. The bill included a \u201ccarve-out\u201d for police officers and firefighters, which Mr. Snyder supported.All these exemptions and carve-outs have a popular appeal. Who, after all, would deny the heroism of police officers and firefighters? The hitch, labor experts contend, is that the exemptions lack any substantive merit.\u201cWhen you get into structural differences, you\u2019re hard pressed to see why anyone would argue that one group should be left out,\u201d said Robert Bruno, a professor of labor relations at the University of Illinois. \u201cThis has to have more to do with the fact that it\u2019s politically dangerous to attack these people.\u201dWhile no one would dismiss the risks that police officers and firefighters face daily, they are not the only public employees whose work is dangerous. Statistically, at least, there are far more dangerous public sector jobs.But even granting that police officers and firefighters have a special claim on the public\u2019s conscience, it is not clear why the most effective way to honor that claim is through more generous pensions. It might make far more sense to rein in their pensions while raising their salaries, said David Lewin, a professor of management at the University of California, Los Angeles.For one thing, police officers and firefighters can retire with full pensions at younger ages than other state employees (beginning at age 50 in Illinois, often younger in other states). That means they frequently spend many more years drawing their pension benefits, even while receiving full-time salaries in the private sector. This drives up long-term costs for municipalities and states.The early retirement policies also deplete police and fire departments of critical employees at precisely the time when they are most valuable.\u201cWhy stay with a 130-year-old pension arrangement that came in when we thought police and firefighter work was all brawn, no brain?\u201d said Professor Lewin. \u201cThat forces folks out just when they\u2019re adding value and intellectual capital.\u201dBut few politicians are challenging these longstanding privileges or asking police officers and firefighters to sacrifice along with other public employees.In Wisconsin, for example, Mr. Walker and other Republicans argued that it was important to insulate police officers and firefighters because the state relies on them during emergencies and cannot afford unrest in their ranks. In Michigan, Mr. Snyder worried that extending right-to-work provisions to police officers and firefighters would hurt their cohesion.That argument is hard to square, however, with statements by Republican legislators and governors like Mr. Snyder that their proposals would be a boon to employees \u2014 one that police officers and firefighters should presumably want to share in, not something they should want to avoid.\u201cThis is all about taking care of the hard-working workers of Michigan, about being pro-worker, about giving them the freedom to choose who they associate with,\u201d Mr. Snyder said when announcing his support for a right-to-work law in 2012.Glenn Grothman, a Wisconsin Republican who as a state senator strongly backed Act 10 and now serves in Congress, said that by making it easier for supervisors to lay off state and municipal workers, the law had actually improved worker morale. \u201cI\u2019ve heard compliments from public employees that are happy they don\u2019t have to work with underperforming employees,\u201d he said.Similarly, Mr. Grothman said that the real purpose of Act 10 was \u201cto improve the quality of education and other government services.\u201d But if policing and firefighting are the most critical services local governments provide, the public would presumably be even more eager to improve them, not less.But the existing arrangements are difficult to alter under the status quo. In the case of firefighter schedules, Mr. Macy said, \u201cthe only way to change that is through bargaining.\u201d\u201cAnd firefighters like that, they protect that,\u201d he said.Some backers of right-to-work laws and curbs on collective bargaining for public employees say they should be applied without exception.A spokesman for Daniel Knodl, a Republican state legislator in Wisconsin, said: \u201cRepresentative Knodl\u2019s position on the Act 10 provisions is that all public employees should be subject to the same provisions. This should include police and firefighters.\u201dIn Michigan, Gary Glenn, a freshman Republican state representative, has drafted legislation that would extend the right-to-work provisions to these employees as well.But for all its consistency, many Republican leaders are reluctant to go along with that view. For governors like Mr. Walker, Mr. Rauner and Mr. Snyder, political considerations appear to trump everything else.Co-opting public safety employees divides and weakens labor unions, according to Harold Schaitberger, general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters.\u201cClearly part of what these governors are doing by treating cops and firefighters differently is driving a wedge in labor,\u201d Mr. Schaitberger said.Police officers and firefighters, Professor Bruno pointed out, are also much more likely than other public employees to be white and male \u2014 precisely the demographics from which Republicans draw their electoral strength.\u201cPeople are happy to see us come to their door,\u201d Mr. Schaitberger said. \u201cThat gives us a face, a voice, an ability to not only push a narrative, but to advance an agenda.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Try Living on the Minimum Wage", "Date": "2015-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialOver half a million workers in New York State subsist on the minimum wage of $8.75 an hour. That\u2019s about $18,000 a year for those working 40 hours a week. Anyone who thinks that is generous should try spending just $350 a week on food, housing, gas and heat. He also said he favored allowing a local option for expensive places like New York City to set their minimums as much as 30 percent higher than the rest of the state.The package does not, however, call for indexing, which would help end the perpetual need to go back to the Legislature and fight for an increase. Mr. Cuomo has also backed away from the local option. The governor\u2019s wage package is weaker without those provisions. If the Legislature doesn\u2019t agree to raise the minimum wage during budget negotiations, which are expected to conclude at the end of March, Mr. Cuomo has another option. He can use his emergency control over wage setting, as he did last month for tipped workers. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has been pushing for an immediate increase to $13.30 an hour with a goal of $15 an hour in the city by 2019; the Assembly has its own similar proposal for the state.

{"Headline": "Israel\u2019s Gilded Age", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut wait: Why are Israelis discontented? After all, Israel\u2019s economy has performed well by the usual measures. It weathered the financial crisis with minimal damage. Over the longer term, it has grown more rapidly than most other advanced economies, and has developed into a high-technology powerhouse. What is there to complain about?The answer, which I don\u2019t think is widely appreciated here, is that while Israel\u2019s economy has grown, this growth has been accompanied by a disturbing transformation in the country\u2019s income distribution and society. Once upon a time, Israel was a country of egalitarian ideals \u2014 the kibbutz population was always a small minority, but it had a large impact on the nation\u2019s self-perception. And it was a fairly equal society in reality, too, right up to the early 1990s.Since then, however, Israel has experienced a dramatic widening of income disparities. Key measures of inequality have soared; Israel is now right up there with America as one of the most unequal societies in the advanced world. And Israel\u2019s experience shows that this matters, that extreme inequality has a corrosive effect on social and political life.Consider what has happened at either end of the spectrum \u2014 the growth in poverty, on one side, and extreme wealth, on the other.And when it comes to children, in particular, relative poverty is the right concept. Families that live on much lower incomes than those of their fellow citizens will, in important ways, be alienated from the society around them, unable to participate fully in the life of the nation. Children growing up in such families will surely be placed at a permanent disadvantage.Still, why is Israeli inequality a political issue? Because it didn\u2019t have to be this extreme.You might think that Israeli inequality is a natural outcome of a high-tech economy that generates strong demand for skilled labor \u2014 or, perhaps, reflects the importance of minority populations with low incomes, namely Arabs and ultrareligious Jews. It turns out, however, that those high poverty rates largely reflect policy choices: Israel does less to lift people out of poverty than any other advanced country \u2014 yes, even less than the United States.So Mr. Netanyahu tried to change the subject from internal inequality to external threats, a tactic those who remember the Bush years should find completely familiar. We\u2019ll find out on Tuesday whether he succeeded.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "3 European Powers Say They Will Join China-Led Bank", "Date": "2015-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe announcement by Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, came only six days after Secretary of State John Kerry asked his German counterpart, Frank Walter-Steinmeier, to resist the Chinese overtures until the Chinese agreed to a number of conditions about transparency and governing of the new entity. But Germany came to the same conclusion that Britain did: China is such a large export and investment market for it that it cannot afford to stay on the sidelines.American officials have fumed that China never approached the Group of 7 \u2014 the consortium of economic powers that the United States has led \u2014 but rather decided to pick off individual members, setting a deadline of the end of March for them to decide whether to join the new organization, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which many refer to by its initials, the A.I.I.B. China, in turn, has long chafed at the idea that the World Bank\u2019s president is traditionally an American, and that France appoints the head of the I.M.F.\u201cThis has been a power struggle,\u201d one senior European official said. \u201cAnd we have moved from the world of 1945.\u201dIn Washington, Jen Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman, declined to criticize the countries that announced they would seek to participate, but expressed reservations. \u201cIt will be important for prospective members of the A.I.I.B. to push for the adoption of those same high standards that other international institutions abide by, including strong board oversight and safeguards,\u201d she said.The European decision is bound to help efforts by Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president and Communist Party chief, to reshape the global balance of power, starting with the institutions that underpin it.Mr. Xi\u2019s predecessors chose to join some of those institutions, including the World Trade Organization, and work from within to amend some of their rules more to China\u2019s liking. But with the new bank, China appears to be stepping up previously halting efforts to also build new, Sino-centric institutions from scratch. China\u2019s control of the bank, however, will face constraints. Britain has insisted on a senior post on its board, and Germany will do the same.China has worked for years to break what it regards as an unfair grip by the United States on global political and financial institutions and to set up rival structures more responsive to Chinese demands for a voice in international affairs commensurate with its status as the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.The United States lobbied its allies not to join the new China-based bank. The United States has argued that the bank at best duplicates, and at worst undermines, the role of the Washington-based World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which has its headquarters in the Philippines, a close American ally at odds with Beijing over the South China Sea. The I.M.F., which manages financial crises, is less directly affected.Ms. Fallon said she expected that South Korea, another close American ally, would also sign up for the new bank and that \u201cin the end, only Japan won\u2019t say yes.\u201d China, she said, is offering a \u201cwhole economic and political package that provides an alternative to the creaking international structures shaped by the U.S. in the postwar period.\u201dWestern officials and anticorruption groups have long criticized China\u2019s lending practices, particularly for infrastructure projects in Africa involving Chinese companies, saying they foster corruption and undercut efforts by the World Bank and I.M.F. to link loans to demands for good governing. China rejects such complaints, pointing to its success in building roads and railway lines quickly in countries bereft of Western capital.In an apparent reference to such concerns, France, Germany and Italy, in a statement declaring their eagerness to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, said they were \u201ckeen to work with the A.I.I.B. founding members to establish an institution that follows the best standards and practices in terms of governance, safeguards, debt and procurement policies.\u201dSnubbing the bank would have angered Beijing, but aside from earning Chinese good will,\u00a0it was not immediately clear what European countries would gain by joining other than the right to endorse and help finance infrastructure projects\u00a0that, in many case, are likely to be dominated by Chinese, not European, construction companies.Europe\u2019s defiance of pressure from Washington over the bank does not signal a major rupture, analysts said. But, they say, it does add friction at a time when the marquee project of trans-Atlantic solidarity, a proposed free trade deal, has lost much of its momentum in the face of fierce hostility from European politicians and activists opposed to American-style capitalism.While heavily dependent on the United States for security, especially since the crisis in Ukraine erupted last year, European countries, Ms. Fallon said, \u201ctend to take the U.S. for granted,\u201d while \u201cChina is very good at lobbying them and promising them things.\u201d But she said Washington had been unwise to expend diplomatic and political capital over the bank when it was clear that even staunch allies like Britain wanted to join it.Since taking over leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012, Mr. Xi has steadily expanded a longstanding Chinese policy of seeking political influence through lending and investment, putting his weight behind an ambitious plan to build maritime and land links between China and Europe that span the Eurasian continent. China began the plan after a 2011 call by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was then secretary of state, for a \u201cnew silk road\u201d to help Afghanistan\u2019s economy.Miffed that Washington had appropriated a term China considers an inseparable part of its own heritage, Mr. Xi in 2013 put forward his own \u201csilk road\u201d plan. This was initially called the Silk Road Economic Belt but, since expanded and shorn of any echoes of the American proposal, is now known in China as the \u201cBelt and Road\u201d scheme, said Ms. Fallon, who has studied the evolution of China\u2019s minutely calibrated nomenclature.China first signaled its desire to set up its own alternative structures as its economy took off in the 1990s. In 1996, in Shanghai, it established a security grouping comprising China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.The body, since joined by Uzbekistan and known as the Shanghai Cooperation Council, has Chinese and Russian as its working languages instead of English, the lingua franca of most international organizations set up under the auspices of the United States.Under Mr. Xi, Beijing has also put itself at the center of a four-year-old grouping of 16 Eastern and Central European countries, promising investment to the region in a push for economic and political influence that has raised eyebrows in Brussels, the headquarters of the European Union.Some see the venture as an attempt to divide the European Union and circumvent the bloc\u2019s rigid rules and standards. Eleven of the nations courted by China in Eastern and Central Europe belong to the union.But China has voiced annoyance at what it derides as \u201cCold War thinking\u201d that divides the world into fixed camps, promoting its efforts to win friends and also contracts in formerly Communist Eastern Europe and elsewhere as part of a \u201cwin-win strategy\u201d beneficial to all.Commenting in Beijing on the decision by European countries to join the new investment bank, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said China \u201cwants to work together with all parties to set up a mutually beneficial, professional infrastructure investment and financing platform to contribute to regional infrastructure and economic development.\u201dWhile China has risen over the last decades to become the second-largest economy \u2014 or even the largest, by some measures \u2014 it is still sidelined at the international level by the reluctance of developed nations to relinquish their privileged places.In one such case, the United States and its partners at the International Monetary Fund agreed in 2010 to give emerging nations an expanded role in the institution. Congress has so far refused to sign on.Speaking on Tuesday in Washington, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said it was \u201curgent that we address prior unmet commitments, which have grown to levels that raise significant questions about U.S. credibility and leadership in the multilateral system.\u201dFailure to do so, he added, could \u201cresult in a loss of U.S. shareholding at a time when new players are challenging U.S. leadership in the multilateral system.\u201dAndrew Higgins reported from Brussels, and David E.

{"Headline": "Beach Dogs, a Bitten Girl and a Roiling Debate in Bali", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKuta Village JournalKUTA VILLAGE, Indonesia \u2014 The controversy began a few weeks ago when a small, cream-colored mutt named Sheila bolted unexpectedly from under a beach hammock and bit a 10-year-old Australian girl in the leg.Kuta Beach, the most popular spot on the getaway island of Bali, is well known for good surfing, cold beer, loud music and mangy-looking beach dogs. The dogs are something of a tourist attraction and generally harmless, except when they are not.Sheila\u2019s bite on Jan. 27 set off a chain of events that has once again plunged this community into a vigorous debate about the island\u2019s canine cohort and what some residents say is the government\u2019s draconian effort to control them, with prime tourist season only a few months away.Minutes after the bite, witnesses said, members of Kuta Village\u2019s security team, armed with clubs, arrived at the beach and surrounded the dog, which in a panic ran to the surf.\u201cOne man chased her with what looked like a large paddle and started repeatedly hitting her on the head, and intermittently drowning her,\u201d said Praveen Elango, a tourist from India. \u201cAnother man approached with a brick and started whacking her with it.\u201dTourists gaped in horror. Sheila escaped and was taken away by a surfing instructor. The Australian girl was rushed to a nearby clinic.But the next day, the other dogs of that section of Kuta Beach, where about half a dozen strays usually roam, were gone. People who work at the beach say the government rounded them up overnight and killed them.\u201cUsually, the dogs are there every day, but since this happened, we have not seen any dogs on Kuta Beach,\u201d said Dedi Suherman, 35, a surfing instructor who also said he witnessed Sheila\u2019s beating. \u201cPeople are pretty angry.\u201dTwo days later, Bali\u2019s governor, I Made Mangku Pastika, invited the public to join the government in killing every stray dog on the island, which he estimated to be 500,000 animals.Bali\u2019s government provides free medical treatment, including vaccination shots, to any resident bitten by a street dog, but the governor said the province had run out of money to buy the vaccine.On average, more than 4,000 people a month were bitten by dogs on Bali, an island of four million people, from 2010 to 2012, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. While few of the dogs are rabid, it is not always possible to know whether one that bites is, so treatment is usually prescribed. If not treated immediately, people can die of rabies.The governor first called on the public to kill street dogs in 2008, after rabies appeared on this island.He did so again last July, complaining about the expense of the vaccines and noting that dog owners were violating the law by letting their pets run free.The local news media reported that more than 120 dogs were culled, mostly by animal control officers, in two remote districts in December and January.The most common methods the government uses include shooting dogs with strychnine-laced darts or administering fatal injections, a practice that has been denounced by animal rights groups and documented in gruesome videos on YouTube.\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible way to die,\u201d said Janice Girardi, an American resident of Bali for more than 30 years and the founder of the Bali Animal Welfare Association, which has campaigned against culling. \u201cIt\u2019s like torture.\u201dAt Kuta Beach, locals share pictures on cellphones and by email of their missing beach dogs wearing the special collars proving that they have been vaccinated for rabies. Moreover, village officials say there has not been a reported case of rabies in dogs or humans at Kuta Beach.Economic and religious themes also play into the debate. This being Bali, where tourism and related industries account for about 80 percent of the economy, news reports of dog bites and rabies outbreaks undermine the image of a tropical island paradise.\u201cMany people don\u2019t like the idea\u201d of killing stray dogs, said Wayan Suarsa, the chief of Kuta Village, \u201cbecause it affects our image. But in some cases, they disturb tourists, and we clearly want to expand our tourism industry.\u201dBut other residents argue that dogs are an important part of the culture on this historically Hindu island, as noted in the Mahabharata, an ancient Indian epic, and are worthy of respect.Putu Sumantra, the head of Bali\u2019s animal husbandry department, said the governor\u2019s comments about \u201cinviting\u201d the public to kill stray dogs had been taken out of context.\u201cIt was the public that asked the government to do it, either during local meetings or through government offices,\u201d he said in a written reply to questions.He said that the government would continue to cull dogs \u201cselectively,\u201d including unvaccinated semiferal dogs, but that vaccination was the government\u2019s primary rabies-eradication strategy. The government has carried out mass vaccination operations and has plans for another one from April to July.That is the right path, public health experts say.\u201cVaccination is the most effective way to stop rabies,\u201d said Eric Brum, a rabies expert and chief technical adviser for the United Nations agriculture agency, which financed the rabies vaccination program in Bali until last year and has trained the dogcatchers there.Culling, on the other hand, is counterproductive, he says.Killing dogs does not reduce contact between sick and healthy animals, while vaccinating the majority of dogs \u2014 70 percent is thought to be effective \u2014 can provide herd immunity. Without other susceptible dogs for rabid animals to pass the disease to, the disease will ultimately die out.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to flood the environment with immune animals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want vaccinated dogs to go out and meet the virus.\u201dRabies cases have dropped rapidly in Bali since the virus first appeared, a fact Dr. Brum attributes to the vaccination campaign, which inoculated more than two million dogs from 2008 to 2014, according to provincial government data.In 2010, there were 421 confirmed animal cases of rabies and 84 human deaths, according to United Nations data. Last year, there were only 132 canine cases and no human deaths.\u201cThe problem is not the dogs \u2014 it\u2019s the virus,\u201d Dr. Brum said.Not for the Australian girl, however, who underwent treatment as a precaution but was probably never in danger of contracting the disease. Sheila had been vaccinated and was wearing her collar proving it, even as she was being beaten by village security.The dog, who has been in hiding with a local family, should not be marked for death, advocates say, but instead should be back on the beach, her immunity helping to keep the virus from spreading.\u201cThey are our warrior dogs,\u201d said Ms. Girardi, the animal welfare advocate.Advertisement"}

Fisher was frequently mistaken in his economic predictions but seldom boring.The departure of Mr. Fisher, who stepped down on Thursday, means that the Fed is losing one of the most outspoken internal opponents of its stimulus campaign just as it is winding down. Mr. Fisher argued right up to his retirement that the central bank was increasing economic inequality, destabilizing financial markets and might yet unleash higher inflation. But he is best known not so much for what he said as for the way he said it.He spoke more often and more colorfully than any of his colleagues at the Federal Reserve, larding his speeches with quotes, anecdotes and metaphors. Among the most memorable was his 2012 description of his breeding bull, Too Big to Fail, as full of liquidity but unable to reach the pretty cows on the other side of the fence.\u201cHis speeches have regularly been the most eloquent \u2014 a true joy to read his somewhat excessive Texas exuberance in explaining both the successes and the possible excesses of monetary policy,\u201d the former Fed chairman Paul A. Volcker, a mentor to Mr. Fisher, said in a recent introduction.Noting that Mr. Fisher was the rare non-economist among senior Fed officials, Mr. Volcker continued: \u201cIn an era in which economists claim a natural right to central banking leadership, Dick has brought a healthy sense of reality, sound judgment, business background and leadership.\u201dBut Mr. Fisher also has angered those who think the Fed can and should do more to help unemployed workers.\u201cHe was wrong at the beginning, and he\u2019s still wrong now,\u201d said Danny Cendejas of the Texas Organizing Project, a nonprofit group that advocates for lower-income Texans. \u201cHe\u2019s ignoring the reality of what\u2019s happening, particularly in the Latino community and in communities of color.\u201dAt the Fed, Mr. Fisher was set apart by his views and his style. He kept a list of roughly 50 executives at corporations ranging from Walmart to American Airlines to \u201cthe Bud distributor in North Texas,\u201d and he called several dozen before each Fed meeting. He insisted that those anecdotal reports offered a more accurate and timely window onto the economy than government data and the Fed\u2019s elaborate models.\u201cMy local dry cleaner, I would say that if you took him and put him against the whole Fed staff in terms of forecasting, he\u2019s been far more accurate,\u201d Mr. Fisher said.Mr. Fisher now worries that the Fed is waiting too long to raise rates and that its efforts to assist the recovery instead will cause another downturn. He said the consequences of the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign would not be clear for some time.\u201cHow long?\u201d he said, repeating a question. \u201cNo idea. And I hope my concerns, which are only expressed as uncertainties, prove to be sleep lost and nothing more.\u201dThese warnings have made Mr. Fisher a popular figure among the Fed\u2019s Republican critics, who also insist that the Fed\u2019s attempts to expand employment are doing more harm than good. So did a February speech in which Mr. Fisher told a New York audience that the Fed should change its governance structure to limit the outsize role of the New York Fed.But Mr. Fisher has spoken sharply against calls from Republican lawmakers for new restrictions on the Fed\u2019s authority. He said he wanted the Fed itself to make better decisions.Mr. Fisher rose in Horatio Alger style from childhood poverty to marry the daughter of a prominent congressman and build a fortune of more than $20 million as an investor. He worked his way through Harvard as a cook and a crew member on the yacht of a wealthy alumnus, and by renting his dorm room to amorous couples. Now he sits on Harvard\u2019s Board of Overseers.He was born in Los Angeles in 1949 to a Norwegian mother and an Australian father who met in South Africa and conceived Mr. Fisher in Shanghai before moving to California. A few years later, propelled by poverty, the family moved to Mexico City, where Mr. Fisher learned to speak Spanish fluently.After returning to California, he won a scholarship to attend Admiral Farragut Academy, a preparatory school for the United States Naval Academy. After two years at Annapolis, a teacher encouraged him to transfer to Harvard.\u201cI thought, \u2018This place is already made,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cThings were moving my way, but I just thought, \u2018This has already been built. I need to go someplace new.\u2019\u201dHe made a fortune investing in distressed assets during the rocky years of the Texas economy in the late 1980s and early 1990s. After two failed runs for the United States Senate, he signed on with the Clinton administration as a deputy trade representative in 1997. He remained in Washington until 2005, when he got a call asking him if he\u2019d like to come back to Texas to run the Dallas Fed.The Fed\u2019s 12 regional branches together oversee the banking system, operate payments infrastructure and conduct economic research. Their presidents also participate in setting monetary policy. And the Dallas Fed has a longstanding preference for outspoken leaders.Mr. Fisher\u2019s predecessor, Robert D. McTeer, was known for reciting cowboy poetry and for his disagreements with the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan. When Mr. Fisher took the job, he changed the hold music on the Dallas Fed\u2019s phone system from country and western to classical.The Dallas Fed\u2019s board has yet to select Mr. Fisher\u2019s successor, but Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, said it was a good bet they would pick someone with a strong voice. \u201cThey like to have people who are cowboys,\u201d she said.He was one of the first Fed officials to raise concerns about the health of the housing market. Yet he was also among the last to understand the depth of the resulting financial crisis. He warned throughout most of 2008 that inflation was the primary danger to the economy \u2014 a threat that has still not materialized \u2014 and that the bleak pronouncements of other Fed officials were fueling an unwarranted sense of panic.In August, as the financial system teetered on the brink of collapse, he voted to raise interest rates, which would have made the situation even worse.In December that year, when the Fed reduced its benchmark interest rate nearly to zero in a move to spur a recovery, Mr. Fisher cast the only dissenting vote. After the meeting, he decided the moment required solidarity and went to Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman, to change his vote.But Mr. Fisher said in the interview here that he had not changed his mind. He said the Fed should never have pushed interest rates below 2 percent, nor bought so many bonds.Like many of the Fed\u2019s critics on the left, Mr. Fisher emphasizes that he is deeply concerned about the damage caused by the Great Recession. He says he simply does not believe the Fed is helping. He says holding down interest rates has mostly enriched the rich, like his own family.The middle class is being squeezed, he said, \u201cbut the Fed can\u2019t fix that.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, sometimes uses the metaphor of a car to talk about monetary policy. Mr. Fisher said he had frequently argued for the substitution of a ship \u201cbecause there are no brakes.\u201dHe told of serving as a student at the Naval Academy on the U.S.S. Truckee, a tanker, as it collided with an aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. Wasp, in June 1968.\u201cThe scariest thing was watching all the other ships pull over the horizon,\u201d he said, and then draws the metaphor: The Fed\u2019s portfolio, which has swelled to more than $4 trillion, is \u201can enormous amount of explosive fuel\u201d and the danger is \u201can explosion of inflation.\u201d\u201cMy successors,\u201d he said, \u201care going to have to be very careful in steering that ship.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Haitian Leader\u2019s Power Grows as Scandals Swirl", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis words have proved prophetic. A political crisis almost four years into Mr. Martelly\u2019s presidency gave life to the fantasy he once described: He is now running the country without the checks and balances of a parliament.After Mr. Martelly and his opponents in Parliament could not agree on elections, most legislative terms expired, and the seats remain empty. Only 11 elected officials remain in the entire country, and the president is one of them.For two months, Mr. Martelly has governed Haiti by executive order, concentrating power in the hands of a man who, his critics say, is a prisoner of his past, surrounded by a network of friends and aides who have been arrested on charges including rape, murder, drug trafficking and kidnapping.As Mr. Martelly strengthens his hold on power, scandals involving those close to him have continued to mount, raising questions about the president\u2019s ability to lead.One of Mr. Martelly\u2019s senior advisers was jailed for six months during the president\u2019s tenure after being accused of killing a man in a gunfight at the Dominican border. Another friend of the president vanished last year, shortly after being released from jail in a marijuana trafficking case. The prosecutor in that case fled the country fearing retaliation.Yet another of the president\u2019s associates is in jail, accused of running a kidnapping ring. The authorities are trying to determine whether the man, Woodley Eth\u00e9art, who said he worked at the Ministry of Interior, laundered ransom money through a lucrative catering contract at the presidential palace, an investigator familiar with the case said.One longtime law enforcement official said he stopped going to events at the palace because he kept running into people who had been arrested on charges as serious as murder but were now working at the presidential offices as security guards.\u201cThere they were, in the palace, carrying automatic weapons,\u201d the official said under the condition that his name not be published out of safety concerns.The Martelly administration\u2019s influence has been criticized most for its effect on the judiciary, where the criminal cases of some people close to the president have stalled or disappeared.Prosecutors who objected to the administration\u2019s interference were fired or fled, and one judge who complained that the president had meddled in a civil corruption case against Sophia Martelly, the first lady, died two days later.\u201cI would be very concerned of this interconnected web of nefarious characters,\u201d said Robert Maguire, a Haiti scholar at George Washington University. \u201cMartelly has empowered them to do what they do. He has established an environment of corruption, abuse of power and impunity.\u201dThe president\u2019s office did not respond to several requests for an interview since January. The presidential spokesman, Lucien Jura, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Mr. Martelly\u2019s allies defended him, saying that the president could not be blamed for the actions of his friends. Several said that he is loyal to a fault, and that he will stand beside old friends no matter what trouble they find themselves in. The president, aides said, wants the best for Haiti but is easily influenced by relatives known for ties to drug trafficking and friends who abuse their proximity to power.One of those relatives, the president\u2019s brother-in-law Charles Saint-R\u00e9my, said the president and his family had been victims of a politically motivated campaign to discredit them.\u201cWe have had stability for four years,\u201d said Daniel Edwin Zenny, a senator allied with the president. \u201cWe used to have 10,000 to 20,000 people protesting on the streets every day. Now we have 1,500 to 4,000, and while they are protesting, the country is moving forward. This is not a big situation yet.\u201d Disputed ElectionWashington\u2019s role in the election and the American ambassador\u2019s warm relationship with him since has hurt Mr. Martelly\u2019s credibility at home, where the president is considered a member of the conservative elite, disconnected from the poor majority.Still, he is credited with getting the vast majority of residents who lost their homes to the devastating 2010 earthquake out of tent cities. Solar panels light once-darkened streets, and government ministries and hotels are being built. An anticorruption law was enacted, and the president found creative ways to enroll more children in primary school.\u201cConstruction is, like, for certain people \u2014 rich people. They built new banks, they built new hotels and government buildings,\u201d said Jean Fran\u00e7ois, 52, a father of six who has lived in a hillside tent for five years. \u201cThe government officials drive by this hill every day, but they don\u2019t see us.\u201dNow that Mr. Martelly can organize elections without consulting opponents in Parliament, it will soon be voting time again. A movement to oust the president appears to be losing steam. A general strike organized by opposition parties in recent days mostly flopped.Among those who protested in the streets demanding Mr. Lamothe\u2019s ouster was Mr. Saint-R\u00e9my, the first lady\u2019s brother, who admits that he sold drugs in his youth but now functions as an unofficial adviser to the president. Mr. Saint-R\u00e9my was furious over the arrest of Mr. Eth\u00e9art, who operates an expensive French restaurant known to be one of the president\u2019s favorite hangouts \u2014 but who has also been identified by the Haitian National Police as being the leader of Galil, a gang of kidnappers.Mr. Saint-R\u00e9my started calling senior government officials to plead for his friend\u2019s release, three people close to the administration said. Simon Desras, who was president of Haiti\u2019s Senate during the political crisis, said that one of the recipients told him he considered the call more a threat than request.\u201cIn Martelly\u2019s environment, you don\u2019t find all saints,\u201d Mr. Desras said. \u201cYou find demons.\u201dMr. Saint-R\u00e9my admitted \u201chaving discussions\u201d with senior officials about the case, because he remains firmly convinced that his friend is innocent and was set up by the politically ambitious former prime minister, Mr. Lamothe, in an effort to discredit the president.\u201cLaurent has been playing heavy politics, because he has always wanted to be the only player standing,\u201d Mr. Saint-R\u00e9my said. Mr. Lamothe did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.Mr. Eth\u00e9art was arrested last year in connection with the kidnapping of a businessman by gunmen in police uniforms who demanded $1.2 million.Telephone records showed that Mr. Eth\u00e9art was in contact with the kidnappers and, like the hostage-takers, had turned off his cellphone at the precise time of the abduction, according to a police investigative report. A Ministry of Interior license plate found on a vehicle at Mr. Eth\u00e9art\u2019s house had been reported in previous kidnappings, an investigator said.The police tied the case to 15 other kidnappings involving 17 hostages and one murder, the police said.But irregularities in the investigation quickly emerged. According to government officials, subpoenas to interview several witnesses stalled for months. When the investigating judge ordered the arrest of Mr. Eth\u00e9art\u2019s wife and closed the expensive French restaurant the couple operated, another judge had her released and lifted the judicial seal on the restaurant\u2019s doors.Mr. Eth\u00e9art has denied wrongdoing, saying his arrest was the result of his \u201cpresidential acquaintances.\u201d He said in a radio interview last year: \u201cI\u2019m like a big Kleenex. They used me and then threw me away.\u201dAn Arrest in the 1990sTwo law enforcement officials in Haiti said that Mr. Eth\u00e9art had been arrested in the late 1990s with a naked man in his trunk, who led officers to a nearby murder scene. Mr. Eth\u00e9art denied the assertions in the radio interview, but acknowledged that at another time he was found with $178,000 in cash \u2014 proceeds, he said, from a music festival in Miami.His lawyer, Claudy Gassant, said that the prosecution\u2019s evidence was flimsy. \u201cNo one in the palace intervened or asked the judiciary to release him. No one,\u201d Mr. Gassant said. \u201cTo me, his relationship with the president does not matter.\u201dEvans Paul, who was named prime minister after Mr. Lamothe\u2019s ouster, said the fact that Mr. Eth\u00e9art is in jail awaiting trial proved that the country had an independent judiciary.\u201cWe cannot stop someone from choosing his friends, and cannot give hold him responsible for his friend\u2019s actions,\u201d Mr. Paul said of the president. \u201cOnly if you can show there is complicity.\u201dThe president was widely criticized for the handling of a 2013 drug-trafficking case involving Evinx Daniel, a prominent hotelier and Martelly campaign supporter who owns Dan\u2019s Creek, a beachfront hotel the president is known to frequent.Mr. Daniel told the authorities that he had found 23 packages of marijuana floating at sea and decided to bring them home. He called the president\u2019s brother-in-law, Mr. Saint-R\u00e9my, who called the United States Drug Enforcement Administration to pick up the load, the brother-in-law said.A prosecutor, Jean Marie Salomon, doubted the story, suspecting that it was a ruse to cover up a drug deal that local residents had stumbled upon, and arrested Mr. Daniel on drug-trafficking charges. But the prosecutor was nervous, because he knew the hotelier had been active in the president\u2019s campaign.A Phone CallThe suspect was brought into custody and allowed to make a phone call. He called the minister of justice, the prosecutor\u2019s boss, and handed over the telephone.\u201cHe told me, \u2018Commissioner, someone wants to talk to you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Salomon recalled in an interview. \u201cHe said, \u2018The minister is on the phone.\u2019\u201dMr. Daniel was released the next day, and Mr. Salomon was suspended for abuse of power and later resigned. The prosecutor\u2019s police bodyguard never showed up for work again, Mr. Salomon said. Mr. Salomon said he saw masked gunmen outside the courthouse just as investigators were calling him to discuss Mr. Daniel\u2019s case.Shortly after, Mr. Salomon said President Martelly went to Port Salut, about 140 miles west of the capital, and stayed at his friend\u2019s hotel.\u201cIt was not only a provocation from the president, but also a coded message,\u201d Mr. Salomon said. \u201cThat day, I understood there was a bounty on me, and my days were numbered.\u201dMr. Salomon called the United Nations for help and fled the country, but has since returned.The hotelier disappeared three months after his release from jail and is widely presumed to be dead. \u201cSince Martelly arrived in office, state institutions have become weaker than before,\u201d said Pierre Esperance, director of the National Human Rights Defense Network. \u201cWe have no rule of law in Haiti.\u201dOne human rights lawyer, Samuel Madistin, filed a complaint asking for an investigation into the sudden death of Judge Jean Serge Joseph in 2013, two days after telling Mr. Madistin that the president had attended an illegal meeting to pressure him to dismiss the case against the first lady.A coroner\u2019s report said that a medical examiner who conducted an autopsy in Quebec lacked the medical files in Haiti needed to be certain how Mr. Joseph had died, but that the death was the result of a cerebral hemorrhage.\u201cI\u2019m not na\u00efve. I know as long as those in office are in power there is no way this case will move forward,\u201d Mr. Madistin said. \u201cBy doing this complaint, it\u2019s like throwing a rock. Someday, the rock must fall somewhere.\u201dAndr\u00e9 Paultre contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economy Grew 2.2% in 4th Quarter, Final Estimate Shows", "Date": "2015-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States economy grew at a rate of slightly more than 2 percent as 2014 drew to a close, but economists fear some of that momentum flagged in the first quarter of this year.At an annualized rate of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, the Commerce Department\u2019s estimate of growth in the period, released Friday, was unchanged from an earlier estimate released in late February.This was the final revision by government statisticians who track the economy\u2019s performance at the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Before the report, economists on Wall Street had expected the growth rate to be revised upward to 2.4 percent.While decent, the economy\u2019s performance in October, November and December 2014 was well below the 5 percent pace of growth in the third quarter and the 4.6 percent rate in the second quarter.Even so, at 2.2 percent, the pace of economic expansion late last year represents healthier growth than is likely to be seen in the current quarter, which ends Tuesday.Although the job market has been showing real signs of life, with the unemployment rate\u2019s falling to 5.5 percent in February as employers hired 295,000 new workers, other yardsticks have been anemic.This week, the government reported that durable goods orders fell last month, and retail sales had also been weak, despite consumers\u2019 having more cash in their pockets because of lower energy prices.One positive factor last year, rising exports, has faded recently, hurt by a strong dollar and weak conditions in key overseas markets like Europe and Brazil. In particular, the decline of the euro against the dollar has made American-made goods more expensive for European consumers.Different components of economic performance within the report did change, but in the end, the overall effect of increased estimates in some sectors was canceled out by downward revisions in others.For example, the estimates for consumer spending and exports were revised slightly upward, but they were effectively washed out by slower inventory additions than first thought. In late 2014, the government said Friday, consumer spending increased at a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.4 percent, better than the previous 4.2 percent estimate made last month.Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS, said smaller stockpiles than initially estimated for last quarter actually suggested slightly healthier growth in the current quarter.\u201cLess inventory is good for the future because it provides a little tailwind for future production,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have downward revisions, it\u2019s better to have it be in inventories than anything else.\u201dStill, like other economists on Wall Street, he foresees a slow start to growth in 2015, estimating that economic output will rise in the first quarter at an annual rate of just over 1 percent. He cautions that the cold winter most likely held back consumer spending, as did a weakening trade balance and potentially lower business investment, especially in the energy sector.Mr. Berger expects the economy\u2019s arc to rise later in the year, with the growth rate average just over 3 percent in the second half of the year, helped by healthier consumer spending.In a separate report Friday morning, the University of Michigan\u2019s monthly survey of consumer sentiment showed a small dip to 93 in March from 95.4 in February, but that was slightly better than experts had expected.Despite the lagging pace of economic growth, consumers have been encouraged recently by a stronger job market and falling gasoline prices. In January, the Michigan index rose to 98.1, its best reading in more than a decade, although a modest rebound in energy prices since then has tempered that enthusiasm.The downshift in early 2015 has echoes of the economy\u2019s performance in the first quarter of 2014, when very cold temperatures and snow were blamed for a 2.1 percent contraction in output.Growth did pick up subsequently last year, but the on-again, off-again pattern of the recovery has frustrated experts and ordinary Americans alike, after years of predictions that sustained gains were finally at hand.On Wednesday, after the durable goods figures were released, Barclays cut its tracking estimate of first-quarter growth to 1.2 percent, as did Macroeconomic Advisers, a widely followed forecasting firm. As recently as Feb. 10, Macroeconomic Advisers had been looking for growth of 2.4 percent in the first quarter.Next week, the economic picture will become a bit clearer, with data due April 3 on job creation and unemployment in March. Figures for the trade balance, home sales, personal consumption and construction in February are set to come out earlier in the week.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Nationwide Protests, Angry Brazilians Call for Ouster of President", "Date": "2015-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across Brazil on Sunday to express their ire at President Dilma Rousseff, raising pressure on her as she grapples with an onslaught of challenges including an economy mired in stagnation, a sweeping bribery scandal and a revolt by some of the most powerful figures in her governing coalition.The payoff racket coincided roughly with the period that Ms. Rousseff led the company\u2019s board of directors. While no testimony has surfaced claiming that she personally profited from the scheme, calls for her impeachment have been growing louder. Political analysts and even some of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s chief political opponents view impeachment as a distant possibility. Yet with her approval ratings falling sharply, Ms. Rousseff has seen her maneuvering room grow more limited to deal with a range of urgent problems.\u201cIf there was thievery all around her and they were looting Petrobras, then, yes, the president is responsible,\u201d said Joana Sim\u00f5es Lopes, 40, a fashion designer who was among the protesters in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s seaside Copacabana district. \u201cShe should resign simply out of shame.\u201dPointing to rising polarization, some prominent supporters of Ms. Rousseff have begun calling supporters of her ouster \u201cgolpistas,\u201d or putschists, claiming the movement reflects dissatisfaction among privileged Brazilians rather than broad-based discontent.But in contrast to leaders elsewhere in the region who have responded to rising dissent by spewing insults at their critics or cracking down with security forces, Ms. Rousseff has taken a relatively nonconfrontational approach. While she has acknowledged the corruption at Petrobras, she contends there is no basis for impeachment.Leaders of the PMDB, who control both houses of Congress, are fuming after the Supreme Court authorized investigations into claims that they received money from the Petrobras bribery scheme. Blaming Ms. Rousseff for their predicament \u2014 the prosecutor general in her government is pursuing the inquiry \u2014 they are threatening to block legislation aimed at bolstering unpopular austerity measures.Beyond the halls of power in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, a public opinion survey by Datafolha, a Brazilian polling company, showed Ms. Rousseff\u2019s approval ratings declining to 23 percent from 42 percent at the end of 2014. The poll, conducted in early February with interviews of 4,000 people, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.Brazil\u2019s diverse economy remains on a stronger footing than neighbors like Argentina and Venezuela. A sense of crisis, however, is spreading through the political establishment, which resents Ms. Rousseff\u2019s top-down management style and questions her reluctance to acknowledge that policies expanding the government\u2019s role in the economy might have accentuated some of the problems Brazil faces.\u201cThere is no evidence for removing Dilma from the presidency, so let her finish her term,\u201d said Kelly Molina Porto, 33, a street vendor who attended smaller protests on Friday here in support of the president. \u201cShe was democratically elected.\u201dAt the same time, others are saying they have had enough after witnessing the evolution of the leftist Workers Party from an insurgent organization that criticized the rampant corruption in Brazil\u2019s political system into an establishment fixture, fending off accusations that it benefited from what may be the largest bribery scandal in the country\u2019s history.\u201cThe economy is entirely for them, and they don\u2019t care if this finishes with Brazil,\u201d said Laerte Alves Machado, 61, a civil engineer among the protesters in S\u00e3o Paulo, referring to the Workers Party. \u201cThey just want to stay in power.\u201dMariana Sim\u00f5es contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Claire Rigby from S\u00e3o Paulo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is It Sheldon Adelson\u2019s World?", "Date": "2015-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe symbolism was too powerful to ignore. As anyone who watched Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech last week in Congress knows, one of the people prominently seated in the House gallery was the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, a primary financial backer of both the Republican Party and Netanyahu. As The Washington Post\u2019s Colby Itkowitz reported, at one point Adelson\u2019s wife, Miriam, accidentally knocked her purse off the House gallery railing and it hit Representative Brad Ashford, a Nebraska Democrat seated below. The Post noted that Adelson had given $5 million to the G.O.P.\u2019s Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC, which had spent $35,000 in a failed effort to defeat Ashford in his 2014 race against Representative Lee Terry. Ashford later joked to The Omaha World-Herald: \u201cI wish I\u2019d opened the purse. Do you think she carries cash?\u201dWe certainly know that Mr. Adelson does. And when it came to showering that cash on Republican presidential hopefuls and right-wing PACs trying to defeat President Obama (reportedly $150 million in 2012), and on keeping Netanyahu and his Likud party in office, no single billionaire-donor is more influential than Sheldon. No matter what his agenda, it is troubling that one man, with a willingness and ability to give away giant sums, can now tilt Israeli and American politics his way at the same time.Israel has much stricter laws on individuals donating to political campaigns, so Adelson got around that in 2007 by founding a free, giveaway newspaper in Israel \u2014 Israel Hayom \u2014 whose sole purpose is to back Netanyahu, attack his enemies in politics and the media, and enforce a far-right political agenda to prevent any Israeli territorial compromise on the West Bank (which, in time, could undermine Israel as a Jewish democracy). Graphically attractive, Israel Hayom is now the biggest-circulation daily in Israel. Precisely because it is free, it is putting a heavy strain on competitors, like Yediot and Haaretz, which both charge and are not pro-Netanyahu.Adelson then bought the most important newspaper of the religious-nationalist right in Israel, Makor Rishon, long considered the main backer of Netanyahu\u2019s biggest right-wing rival, Economy Minister Naftali Bennett. Last March, in an interview with Israel Army Radio after the Makor Rishon sale, Bennett said: \u201cIt saddens me. Israel Hayom is not a newspaper. It is Pravda. It\u2019s the mouthpiece of one person, the prime minister. At every junction point, every point of friction between the national interest and the interest of the prime minister, they chose the side of the prime minister.\u201dThe Washington Post said that last November at a conference of the Israel American Council, a lobbying group Adelson has funded, he joked in a public discussion with a wealthy Israeli: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you and I go after The New York Times?\u201d Told it was family owned, Adelson quipped, \u201cThere is only one way to fight it: money.\u201d At this same conference Adelson was quoted as saying that Israel would not be able to survive as a democracy: \u201cSo Israel won\u2019t be a democratic state,\u201d he added. \u201cSo what?\u201dLast March in Las Vegas Adelson organized his own private Republican primary. Politico wrote at the time: \u201cAdelson summoned [Jeb] Bush and Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey, John Kasich of Ohio and Scott Walker of Wisconsin to Las Vegas. ... The new big-money political landscape \u2014 in which a handful of donors can dramatically alter a campaign with just a check or two.\u201d When Christie, in his speech before Adelson, described the West Bank as \u201coccupied territories,\u201d some Republican Jews in the audience were appalled. So, Politico reported, Christie hastily arranged a meeting with Adelson to explain that he had misspoken and that he was a true friend of Israel. \u201cThe New Jersey governor apologized in a private meeting in the casino mogul\u2019s Venetian office shortly afterward,\u201d Politico reported. It said Adelson \u201caccepted\u201d Christie\u2019s \u201cexplanation\u201d and \u201cquick apology.\u201dWhen money in politics gets this big, when it can make elected officials bow and scrape in two different countries at the same time, it is troubling. I\u2019m sure Adelson cares deeply about Israel, but he lacks any sense of limits in how he exercises his extraordinary financial power \u2014 power he is using to simultaneously push Israel and America toward eliminating any two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians, toward defunding the Palestinian Authority and toward a confrontation with Iran, not a diplomatic solution. People need to know this.The most important bonds between Israel and America always emerged from the bottom up \u2014 a mutual respect between two democracy-loving peoples. Money can\u2019t buy those bonds, but it can threaten them by going to excess \u2014 by taking Israel\u2019s true good will in America and using it to help one party \u201cstick it\u201d to the president, one big donor drive his extreme agenda, one party appear more pro-Israel than the other for electoral reasons or one Israeli politician win re-election. People who go \u201call the way\u201d like this will one day go over a cliff. They will regret it. So will the rest of us.Thomas L. Friedman\u2019s column on Wednesday incorrectly suggested that the businessman Sheldon Adelson is Israeli. He is American.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Make Way for Generation Z ", "Date": "2015-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPreoccupationsI recall the exact moment the temperature changed in the workplace. It was 2005, and I was speaking to an audience of 100 young professionals. I was relating my experiences building a career as a Gen Xer (born 1964-79) in a world of traditionalists (born before 1945) and baby boomers (born 1946-63). Every time I threw out phrases like \u201cpaying your dues\u201d and \u201cplaying the game,\u201d the audience stared at me blankly. This was not the reaction I had come to expect from early twentysomethings. Usually they took notes on how they could get ahead in corporate America as quickly as possible. I would soon learn, however, that the millennial generation (also known as Generation Y, born after 1980), had come on the scene. Generally speaking, these guys didn\u2019t like my advice about coping with bureaucracy and office politics. It seemed to me that some of them didn\u2019t want to grow up, but at the same time they felt they deserved to do meaningful work right away. Many were not afraid to speak their minds and made it clear they wanted to change the status quo. And at 80 million strong, they had the numbers to do it. It took 10 years before most organizations identified the millennials as a talent issue on fire. By now, the oldest millennials are 35. They aren\u2019t children anymore \u2014 in fact, a majority of them are leaders with decision-making power and direct reports. While executives have been fretting over the millennials, though, a new generation is growing up behind the scenes \u2014 Generation Z (born starting in the mid-90s to the early \u201900s depending on whom you ask). Within the next three years, Gen Zers will be the college grads in my audiences, and they are poised to be somewhat different from the millennials.I\u2019ve now had the opportunity to meet lots of Gen Zers, and here\u2019s what I\u2019ve noticed. To start, they tend to be independent. While a 2015 Census Bureau report found that nearly a third of millennials are still living with their parents, Gen Zers are growing up in a healthier economy and appear eager to be cut loose. They don\u2019t wait for their parents to teach them things or tell them how to make decisions. As demonstrated by the teenagers attending the recent Generation Z Conference at American University in Washington, Gen Z is already out in the world, curious and driven, investigating how to obtain relevant professional experience before college. Despite their obvious technology proficiency, Gen Zers seem to prefer in-person to online interaction and are being schooled in emotional intelligence from a young age. Thanks to social media, they are accustomed to engaging with friends all over the world, so they are well prepared for a global business environment.Gen Z is also diverse. My 15-year-old next-door neighbor is a quarter Hispanic, a quarter African-American, a quarter Taiwanese, and a quarter white. That\u2019s Gen Z \u2014 they are often a mix of ethnicities.At the conference, a few hundred teenagers gathered to take that first step. The mood was electric.\u201cThe young people at the conference want to take an active role in their communities and their futures,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an upbeat group that\u2019s full of passion.\u201dSejal signed up for sessions on finance, investing and networking. She says that her parents did not push her to register for the Gen Z event, nor do they help her with her nonprofit organization. \u201cMy parents are supportive, and they\u2019ve had to drive me around, but generally they\u2019re pretty hands-off,\u201d she said. Many Gen Zers intend to go to traditional college, but after that, their lives and careers are likely to be anything but traditional. Even well-known organizations will have to rethink their recruiting practices to attract this group, and now is the time to start. Those who want to take advantage of Gen Z talent in the future need to develop relationships today with teenagers in grades seven through 12. Get into their schools, provide mentorship and education, and put yourself in a position to help shape their career decisions. They are eager to listen. Filling the talent pipeline has never been so critical now that the United States is facing a skills gap in most industries. Even if you\u2019re a small operation, you can still have a Gen Z internship program. These children are so mature and they learn so fast, they might just be ready to take over by the time they\u2019re 22.ALEXANDRA LEVIT is a workplace consultant and the author of \u201cThey Don\u2019t Teach Corporate in College.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bypassing the Questions and Delays at Passport Control ", "Date": "2015-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorial ObserverSecond perhaps only to visits to the dentist, the form of human interaction I dreaded most over the years was passport control upon arrival to the United States.

Instead of focusing mainly on those who raised red flags, he added, \u201cWhat about identifying good travelers and getting them out of the way?\u201dInitially, there were skeptics in the agency who wondered if processing travelers into the United States could be done safely using a machine that resembles an A.T.M. and is about as easy to use. \u201cYou have to be cognizant of the impact on travel and the economy when you have excessively long wait lines,\u201d Mr. Wagner said.

{"Headline": "Smothered by a Boom in Banking", "Date": "2015-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameAttendees at last week\u2019s JPMorgan Chase annual investor day once again asked the question that no big bank executive wants to hear. Wouldn\u2019t shareholders be better off if the company were smaller or broken up?No, no and no, JPMorgan replied. \u201cScale has always defined the winner in banking,\u201d said Marianne Lake, the company\u2019s chief financial officer.It is to be expected that all big bank executives believe in big finance. They benefit from being giant, after all.For the rest of us, though, it\u2019s worth noting that the effects of a dominant financial industry are far less beneficial.Certainly, as we learned in 2008, when megabanks get into trouble, they line up for bailouts. This imperils taxpayers.The paper\u2019s co-authors are Stephen G. Cecchetti, economics professor at Brandeis International Business School, and Enisse Kharroubi, senior economist at the B.I.S. Their findings are a great addition to the debate about how much is too much when it comes to the role finance should play in our economy.This idea seems almost counterintuitive. Wouldn\u2019t a booming finance industry mean that money is humming through all parts of the economy, financing growth in all kinds of industries? In the new paper, the authors looked for an answer. They studied 33 manufacturing industries in 15 advanced economies around the world.They found that financial booms were especially harmful to certain industries. Bankers, they say, act in predictable ways. They tend to lend money to projects with assets that can be pledged as collateral, such as those in real estate or construction. This is understandable \u2014 bankers want to be able to seize assets if a borrower gets into trouble on a loan, and they prefer those assets to be tangible.But these industries are also among the least productive, and that leaves fewer dollars for more promising research-and-development start-ups that may have only intangibles, such as knowledge and ideas, to offer a banker as collateral. Even though such start-ups have far more potential than projects backed by tangible collateral, they don\u2019t attract the financing they need.This is true during slow-growth economic times as well, but during boom times, so much money crowds into less productive sectors that the overall economy suffers.\u201cBy draining resources from the real economy,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cfinancial-sector growth becomes a drag on real growth.\u201dThe impact is sizable.\u201cWe find unambiguous evidence for very large effects of financial booms on industries that either have significant external financing needs or are R.&D.-intensive,\u201d the authors concluded in their paper. Even in economies where finance is growing quickly, industries that require a lot of research and development trail the performance of other industries in economies where finance is experiencing slower growth, they found. In fact, that productivity growth appeared to be two percentage points lower per year. Two percentage points a year is an enormous difference.Another pernicious element is at work, the authors said. When finance is ascendant in an economy, it attracts an inordinate number of highly skilled workers who might otherwise take their productivity and brains to nonfinancial industries.I spoke with Professor Cecchetti last week about the paper. \u201cWhen I was in college long ago, all my friends wanted to figure out how to cure cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cBut by the 1990s, everyone wanted to become hedge fund managers. Do we want to have more hedge fund managers or more people trying to figure out how to solve our energy and environmental problems or otherwise improving our lives? That\u2019s the way I think about the problem.\u201dThere may be hope on that score. Some 31 percent of the Yale class of 2000 were employed in finance a year after graduation; among last year\u2019s class, 17 percent went to work in the industry, according to a university survey.Also questioning the dominance of finance in our society is Luigi Zingales, professor of entrepreneurship and finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. In his 2012 book, \u201cA Capitalism for the People,\u201d he wrote that the financial sector, \u201cthanks to its resources and cleverness, has increasingly been able to rig the rules to its own advantage.\u201dIf big finance can have such injurious implications, what should policy makers do? \u201cIn some countries we see governments that are very protectionist of financial companies,\u201d Professor Cecchetti said. \u201cThe two issues you want to worry about are what happens when there is too much debt and financing in your economy, and if you are subsidizing it, you might want to think about that pretty hard.\u201dOne way we subsidize debt in this country is by providing tax deductions for mortgage interest. That policy encourages borrowers to take on bigger home loans than they otherwise might.Even now, as the mortgage crisis recedes into the distance, it remains critical that we assess the financial industry\u2019s purpose and try to determine whether it adds value in our society.Ideally, finance should propel an economy by helping create jobs and wealth for a broad portion of the population. But clearly, there\u2019s a point when finance sucks too much oxygen out of the room, leaving the rest of us gasping for air.Bigger, in finance, it seems, is not better.Advertisement"}

King Elementary School in Monrovia rose to sing Liberia\u2019s national anthem. It was their first day back, eight months after schools were closed to stop the spread of Ebola. Many of the children wore long sleeves and trousers that covered as much skin as possible.MONROVIA, Liberia \u2014 A couple of dozen students sat quietly inside the C.D.B. King Elementary School\u2019s dim and dusty auditorium on their first morning back. Despite the stuffy heat, many of the children wore long sleeves and trousers that covered as much skin as possible.A second grader wore pink knit mittens that muffled the sound of his clapping when the teachers introduced themselves. As everyone rose to sing Liberia\u2019s national anthem, he saluted with his left hand, still sheathed in the mitten.But Liberia\u2019s on-again, off-again back-to-school campaign is also a measure of the long shadow cast by Ebola, a disease that affected almost every facet of society in the hardest-hit countries, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.Though Ebola cases have all but disappeared in Liberia, with the Health Ministry saying Wednesday that the last patient in treatment had tested negative for the virus, lingering fear and a depressed economy have dampened the turnout at schools. Many have yet to reopen, having failed to meet the minimum requirements put in place to prevent transmission of the virus.Many of those that have reopened are struggling. Just as Liberia\u2019s weak health care system collapsed as Ebola began raging across the country, many people here worry that the nation\u2019s schools may be ill equipped to handle even the tail end of the epidemic.C.D.B. King, despite being in the center of the capital, lacks electricity and running water, and has only a few toilet stalls for a student population that numbered 1,000 before the outbreak.Now, the school is trying to overcome those longstanding problems \u2014 and the ravages of a disease that has killed more than 9,600 people in the region.Fanning herself with a sheet of paper, Ms. Crayton, the vice principal, rattled off a list of don\u2019ts: Don\u2019t play rough. Don\u2019t exchange pencils. Don\u2019t share food. Don\u2019t spit. Don\u2019t urinate in the courtyard. Don\u2019t hide illness in the family.\u201cIf you want to live,\u201d she told the students, \u201cdon\u2019t lie about Ebola.\u201dBy the end of the first day of class, only about 30 students had showed up.\u201cPeople are still afraid, so they are careful with their kids,\u201d said Augustus Seongbae, the principal. \u201cMany of them are watching what happens to the kids who come first.\u201dFierce disagreement over whether to resume classes forced the government to change the original start date of Feb. 2 several times before finally deciding to reopen schools on a rolling basis starting on Feb. 16. The government said that with Ebola waning, many children were already playing in their communities, and that potential teaching time in the classroom was being frittered away.Tolbert Nyenswah, the Liberian deputy health minister in charge of the Ebola response, said Wednesday that there had been no new confirmed cases of the disease in the country for 12 days, but that officials were still tracking 102 people for possible exposure to the virus.\u201cWe are not out of the woods yet,\u201d he said.Many parents have complained that because of Ebola\u2019s chilling effect on the economy, they needed more time to gather the resources to send their children to school.Miatta Fahnbulleh, the mother of the boy with the pink mittens, James Nyema, 9, used to send him to a private school. But because she had been unemployed for months from her job as a kindergarten teacher, she had chosen to send him to C.D.B. King, a public school. Public schools are free, though parents must pay for uniforms and other supplies.She walked her son, known as J.C. because his middle name is Christian, to school in the morning with a blue plastic bag containing his lunch and a water bottle.\u201cI told him when he was going, \u2018Don\u2019t deal with anybody, don\u2019t drink anybody\u2019s water, don\u2019t touch anybody,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said, laughing, as she came to pick up her son after lunch.She had dressed him in trousers and long sleeves, which he usually wore only during the rainy season \u2014 not now, the driest and hottest time of the year. She had bought the mittens at a nearby market, where they had become available during the height of the epidemic last year.On Saturday, the World Health Organization declared Liberia free of Ebola.\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d she said, laughing again.Liberia\u2019s 14-year civil war, which ended in 2003, destroyed schools and left a generation that is less educated than older ones.\u201cProminent people came from our school, ministers and government officials,\u201d said Thomas Deshield, a teacher at C.D.B. King, which is named after a former president and is one of the oldest public schools in the capital.Since the end of the war, Liberia has focused on expanding access to education; 1.2 million Liberians were in school before Ebola, out of a population of 4.3 million. But C.D.B. King and many other public schools suffer from a scarcity of resources and crumbling infrastructure. Public schoolteachers are often poorly trained and unmotivated.\u201cWe realize that it\u2019s been good to get a lot of people in,\u201d said Albert Coleman, the Ministry of Education official overseeing the reopening of schools. \u201cBut if we must develop and move forward as a country, our emphasis should be more on quality and a little bit less on access.\u201dMost Liberians prefer enrolling their children in private schools, which account for more than a third of the nation\u2019s 4,460 educational facilities. But with many private schools now reporting a drop in enrollment because parents are unable to afford them, many parents are expected to register their children at already strained public schools in the weeks and months ahead.At C.D.B. King, Ms. Crayton arrived at 6:30 a.m. on the second day of class to try to make the school safe against Ebola. No one at the school had received any direct training, so she consulted an instruction pamphlet she had received along with materials from international donors \u2014 infrared thermometers, buckets, chlorine, rubber boots and gloves, brushes and soap.She chased away local petty traders who had stored their goods overnight in the schoolyard. \u201cThis is a government school,\u201d she told one woman, who scampered away with her wares on her head.The school\u2019s lone security guard \u2014 who ran at least two side businesses, including renting out the schoolyard for storage and operating a prepaid cellphone card business just outside the school entrance \u2014 was put in charge of taking incoming students\u2019 temperature. Hand-washing stations, filled with chlorine and water drawn from the well in the schoolyard, were set up at the entrances to the school and the toilets.A teacher rang a cowbell to call the morning assembly. After the Lord\u2019s Prayer, Ms. Crayton warned her students, \u201cEbola is still in town, so we just want you to be very, very, very careful.\u201dThe first student to show up for school that morning, and most mornings that week, was J.C., with his pink mittens.Born in a United Nations refugee camp in Ghana, where his mother stayed for several years, J.C. now lived 15 minutes away from the school, sharing a room with his mother and younger sister.During the epidemic, J.C.\u2019s mother never let him outside the home. A creative boy who often talked to himself, J.C. did pirouettes and seemed to be performing plays in his mind. He had no problem keeping himself occupied, his mother, Ms. Fahnbulleh, said.But even J.C. was getting restless and was eager to be back in school, though perhaps not on the third morning of the first week when he and two classmates were called into the vice principal\u2019s office. The three boys had drunk from J.C.\u2019s water bottle, and a girl in the classroom had immediately told on them.\u201cI threatened to send them home,\u201d the vice principal said. \u201cBut they begged. They got on the floor. \u2018You can beat us,\u2019 they said, \u2018but don\u2019t send us home.\u2019\u00a0\u201dOver the remainder of the first week, some of the pieces began falling into place at C.D.B. King. Liberia\u2019s red, white and blue flag was hoisted up in the schoolyard. The children seemed to relax, and J.C. even wore shorts by the end of the week. By Friday, about 60 students had showed up.The cowbell set the children free. Unable to find an aunt who was supposed to accompany him, J.C. began walking home, lingering in front of stores with toys. Back home, his mother laughed when asked about her son\u2019s short pants and sleeves, with the mittens nowhere in sight.\u201cWe\u2019re afraid-o,\u201d she said. \u201cEbola is still here.\u201dSheri Fink contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Citing Fear of Neo-Nazi Group, a German Mayor Quits", "Date": "2015-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 The mayor of a small town in eastern Germany said Wednesday that fear for his family led to his decision to resign his post after the local authorities failed to block an anti-immigration demonstration by neo-Nazis outside of his home.The resignation of Markus Nierth, 46, mayor of Tr\u00f6glitz, has set off a firestorm in Germany, where the authorities have become increasingly alarmed by the growing strength of far-right forces that have been taking to the streets to protest a swelling number of asylum seekers.Mr. Nierth, a father of seven, told German public television ARD on Wednesday that the decision had been difficult, but after the local authorities refused to block the march, he was left without a choice but to step down from his elected but unpaid post. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any other way to protect my family from this demonstration,\u201d he said.The march, which still took place on Sunday, after his resignation, was apparently prompted in part by Mr. Nierth\u2019s support of plans to house several dozen refugees in an unused building in the center of Tr\u00f6glitz, over the objections of neo-Nazis who had held seven demonstrations in the town since the beginning of the year.Mr. Nierth said he was initially targeted on social media, and became worried when the decision to march past his house was announced. When he realized that regional security officials were not going to intervene to stop it, he said, he decided to step down.\u201cShould I have expected that my children, who have already had to put up with a lot lately, to look out of their windows and see armed police and hear the hate-filled and racist chants?\u201d Mr. Nierth said in announcing his decision.His decision has become fodder for a national debate on the growing power of neo-Nazis and prompted members of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government and opposition parties to speak out. German leaders have been watching as a tide of refugees has helped to galvanize support for far-right extremists, such as the far-right National Democratic Party, known by its German initials N.P.D., and grass-roots anti-immigrant movements.\u201cIt is a tragedy for our democracy when an elected mayor has to step down due to hostility from neo-Nazis,\u201d Heiko Maas, Germany\u2019s justice minister, said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cSomeone who wants to support refugees in need actually deserves our wholehearted support.\u201dLast year, 173,000 people applied for asylum in Germany, and more than 25,000 have submitted applications already this year. Although it is Europe\u2019s strongest economy, the country of 80 million is straining to accommodate the newcomers, many of whom made their way to Germany after fleeing the war in Syria.While many communities have welcomed them, the large numbers have also raised fears and emboldened far-right forces who observers say are seizing on the crisis to gain support.\u201cIf a democratically elected mayor needs to step down to protect himself from a far-right mob, then all alarm bells need to be going off,\u201d Cem Ozdemir, head of the opposition Greens told public broadcaster SWR. \u201cSomething like this cannot be allowed to happen in Germany in 2015.\u201dGermany lacks a strong far-right party such as the National Front in France or the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands, given its mindfulness of 20th century history. But in recent months, it has experienced the growth of a populist tide, with thousands of people taking part in weekly demonstrations organized by an anti-immigrant movement calling itself Pegida, or Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West.Support for Pegida dipped to only several hundred participants in the weekly marches after a leadership crisis earlier this year, but on Monday the group again mobilized several thousand people in Dresden.Some of the targets of the neo-Nazis have been local officials like Mr. Nierth who have supported plans to house refugees in their communities. The officials have been victims of social media campaigns, threatening letters and vandalism, with far-right slogans smeared on public buildings.In one recent case, the mayor of Magdeburg, the state capital of Saxony-Anhalt, said that he had received three anonymous, threatening letters in 10 days. \u201cThey are very clear death threats, signed with a \u2018Heil Hitler\u2019 and Nazi symbols,\u201d Lutz Tr\u00fcmper told state broadcaster MDR. The police are investigating and have assigned a security detail to protect him.In 2013 a local N.P.D. politician in the town of Schneeberg in the eastern German state of Saxony gathered several dozen people to surround the mayor\u2019s home, after he announced the city would be taking in refugees. In the western city of Dortmund, the police barred members of a far-right party from holding a rally outside of the home of Mayor Ullrich Sierau, who continued to receive threats from neo-Nazis.In Tr\u00f6glitz, regional officials decided on Monday to go ahead with plans to accommodate 40 refugees. Mr. Nierth, whose replacement will be elected in the coming weeks, said the decision was proof that \u201cthe mob on the street\u201d had not won.But on Wednesday he called on the government to do more to inform Germans about the refugees. \u201cI think that regarding asylum policy, many people have a feeling that it is not working,\u201d he said on ARD, \u201cand many people feel that it could be better explained.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Cheap and high-quality?Steve Easterbrook seems to think so. Mr. Easterbrook took over as the chief executive of McDonald\u2019s on March 1, and last week he was in Las Vegas, where the company presented franchisees and suppliers with a new vision of McDonald\u2019s. That \u201cdestination,\u201d as it was called, was McDonald\u2019s as \u201ca modern, progressive burger and breakfast restaurant\u201d where \u201ccustomization and made to order\u201d are essential and where executives \u201calign our food story around the consumer\u2019s definition of quality and value.\u201dBy Tuesday, when the meeting started, he was realigning the company\u2019s food story. Mr. Easterbrook\u2019s first major act as C.E.O. was to announce that within two years all the chicken served at its restaurants would be free of antibiotics, or at least those antibiotics also used in humans. It was a big move for McDonald\u2019s, which is one of the biggest buyers of chicken, and one that pleased health officials who see overuse of antibiotics in animal husbandry \u2014 and the resulting antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria \u2014 as a serious threat to human health.A 47-year-old British national, Mr. Easterbrook has spent nearly his entire career in Europe, most of it with McDonald\u2019s. He is credited with turning around the company\u2019s 1,200-store business in Britain in part by doing things \u2014 reducing the salt in fries, adding organic milk \u2014 that appealed to a more health-conscious consumer.While some analysts have urged the company to stop trying new things and focus on its core burger business, Mr. Easterbrook pushed back on that notion at a meeting with investors this year. \u201cTo me, he seemed clearly wedded to the notion that they need to try new things to restore growth,\u201d said one analyst who attended the meeting.Mr. Easterbrook, who declined to be interviewed, may find the challenge in the United States particularly daunting. His predecessor certainly did. While McDonald\u2019s is among the world\u2019s largest restaurant chains with more than 36,000 outlets, about 14,000 of those in the United States, its performance is slipping fast. Same-store sales have fallen over the last five years, and last year the company turned in a miserable performance.If Mr. Easterbrook is trying to attract a more affluent, food-conscious customer, he is surely aware of all the ways McDonald\u2019s has already stumbled on that path. Mike Donahue, who headed communications at McDonald\u2019s from 1987 until 2006, points out that the company has tried a dizzying array of tactics to reinvigorate its business and shed its bad-food image, like new products, healthier options, lower prices, higher prices, store revamps and greater transparency, to little avail.\u201cNow more than ever, the company is facing the perfect storm that is challenging its very relevancy,\u201d said Mr. Donahue. He should know. He left McDonald\u2019s to help start Lyfe Kitchen, a restaurant chain that markets healthy meals and local ingredients.McDonald\u2019s rivals are winning on taste and image. To catch them, the company might have to sacrifice on speed, which has been its main advantage. And even on that score, it\u2019s not doing so well.\u201cThe two key words in fast food are fast and food, and McDonald\u2019s is no longer fast, and its burgers ranked last in a Consumer Reports survey recently,\u201d said Larry Light, chief executive of Arcature, a consulting firm, and a former McDonald\u2019s executive. \u201cThose are their No. 1 and No. 2 challenges, but I\u2019m not sure they know it.\u201dSuccess Measured in SecondsThirty-seven seconds.That\u2019s what it takes to alienate a customer.Ten years ago, customers placing orders in the drive-through lane at McDonald\u2019s would have their food in about two and a half minutes (or 152 seconds, if you want to get precise). Today, the same order takes a bit over three minutes (or 189.5 seconds) on average, according to analyst research from Janney Montgomery Scott. While a half-minute extra might not seem like a lot, it represents lost customers and revenue at a company that can ill afford to lose either.When Richard Adams owned a string of McDonald\u2019s franchises in Southern California, he liked to sit outside and do paperwork. It gave him great insight into the business, he said, and how all those seconds add up.\u201cMy magic number was 13,\u201d said Mr. Adams, who now has a consulting firm. \u201cOnce 13 cars had lined up in the drive-through, all the other cars would turn around and drive away. There was a point where people just wouldn\u2019t wait. McDonald\u2019s has ignored this problem for a long time.\u201dThe longer wait times are primarily the result of efforts to make McDonald\u2019s more varied and relevant in a premium, fast-casual world. And perhaps nothing exemplifies this problem better than the Premium McWrap.In 2002, McDonald\u2019s added Chicken Selects to its menu. The strips of chicken breast in a crispy batter proved so popular that franchisees struggled to keep up with demand. They were sold in servings of three, five and 10, and the company simply couldn\u2019t make enough of them. Its response was to slowly replace the big servings of Selects with a simple snack wrap that used just one Select strip. It was dabbed with ranch sauce, dressed with the same shredded cheese and lettuce used in other preparations and wrapped in a tortilla.The snack wrap was so successful that franchisees in Europe, where the menu traditionally is more limited than in the United States, asked for a souped-up version that they could sell at a higher price. The Premium McWrap was born.But when McDonald\u2019s brought it back to the United States, the Premium McWrap flopped. It took McDonald\u2019s two years just to establish a supply chain for cucumbers, which it had never used before, and the wraps proved devilishly difficult to assemble. It takes 60 seconds on average for a worker to assemble a Premium McWrap, according to franchisees, compared with roughly 10 seconds to assemble a burger.Last summer, McDonald\u2019s announced that it was testing \u201chigh-density prep tables\u201d to try to address the problems with the wraps. This only frustrated franchisees more because they had to make yet another investment in the tables to fix a product that wasn\u2019t selling well.\u201cThe problem is not that consumers don\u2019t want hamburgers, as anyone who\u2019s been to Five Guys recently can tell you,\u201d said a former McDonald\u2019s executive whose severance agreement effectively made it impossible for him to speak publicly about the company without taking a financial hit. \u201cWhat they\u2019re waiting for is a better hamburger from McDonald\u2019s, not a wrap.\u201dBarry Klein, the former McDonald\u2019s marketing executive who created Ronald McDonald, agrees. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see that wrap go away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems that Thompson thought that by trying to be all things to all people, by getting more products into the lineup, he would be able to maintain volumes,\u201d said Mr. Klein, referring to Don Thompson, whom Mr. Easterbrook replaced. \u201cInstead, operations got so complicated that waiting times went up, and people didn\u2019t come in droves for the new menu items.\u201dMr. Klein is among the few consumers who\u2019ve had a chance to try McDonald\u2019s latest turnaround effort \u2014 a Create Your Own tablet that allows people to custom-build their sandwiches from a menu of meats, toppings and buns. The burger he got, he said, could compete with the more succulent ones at, say, Elevation Burger.But it also was about $1.50 more than a Big Mac and required him to wait at a table to be served. The new burgers can be ordered only inside restaurants, and because they\u2019re made from raw patties, not the precooked ones used in the standard burger, they take seven or eight minutes to prepare, an eternity for the typical McDonald\u2019s customer. \u201cWhen something like two-thirds of the business is drive-through,\u201d Mr. Klein said, \u201cthis is not the solution.\u201dAlso, franchisees have not forgotten that McDonald\u2019s already tried a higher-priced burger, the Angus Deluxe, and failed. It was removed from the menu in 2013 after a four-year run. They are wary of the new build-your-own-burger idea, according to Mr. Adams, the franchisee turned consultant.Mr. Adams surveys about one-third of McDonald\u2019s franchisees every quarter. \u201cFor the last three or four years, they\u2019ve been saying the biggest problem is menu complexity,\u201d he said. \u201cNow management is finally talking about menu simplification on the one hand, and on the other hand, with this Create Your Own thing, starting to roll out an entirely new restaurant system within the restaurants.\u201dThe Create Your Own setup will cost franchisees about $100,000 per store, Mr. Adams said. Those who invest must have shaved Parmesan on hand, in addition to the shredded lettuce used for regular burgers, not to mention grilled onions, jalape\u00f1os, avocado and 30 other toppings. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s has many strengths that it\u2019s had for decades,\u201d said Mark Kalinowski, an investment analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. \u201cCustomization is not one of them.\u201dReaching for the HaloMcDonald\u2019s has been around for more than 60 years. It\u2019s been through bad times and recovered. Given its extraordinary brand recognition, it can\u2019t be dismissed. A bottle of its \u201csecret sauce\u201d recently sold for more than $14,000 on eBay.Also, it has innovated, even out of failure. The fast-food breakfast is such a staple now that we forget McDonald\u2019s invented it in the 1970s with the Egg McMuffin.\u201cAtlanta was a test market for breakfast, and it was failing and failing badly,\u201d said Michael McDonald, a former advertising executive whose firm worked for McDonald\u2019s in its southern region back then. The problem was that Atlanta residents had no clue what an English muffin was. \u201cWe like soft, doughy biscuits,\u201d Mr. McDonald said. A series of radio ads voiced by a man with a thick Southern accent, who explained that there was \u201cthis muffin from England\u201d and \u201cbacon from Canada that\u2019s really just like ham,\u201d saved the Egg McMuffin.Today, breakfast accounts for some 25 percent of McDonald\u2019s sales.More recently, McDonald\u2019s in 2009 added espresso drinks to the menus in McCaf\u00e9, an attempt to compete with Starbucks. The espresso machines cost $13,000 apiece, and were largely idle, to the frustration of franchisees who made the investment, according to several former executives. So the company regrouped, adding fruit-flavored frozen drinks that offset the lack of interest in espresso.\u201cMcDonald\u2019s dodged a bullet there because the next spring, corporate quickly rolled out the crushed-ice drinks, which have been a huge success,\u201d Mr. Adams said. Today, McCaf\u00e9 counters draw customers into stores in the afternoons, traditionally a lull period, and a no-frills cup of McDonald\u2019s coffee competes so well with Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and Starbucks that McDonald\u2019s is starting to sell ground coffee in grocery stores.Mr. Donahue, the former communications chief, said the company had allowed itself to be defined by others. \u201cInstead of telling consumers that they sell more chicken than beef and are the No. 1 seller of apples, for instance, they\u2019ve allowed the fringe groups and so-called influencers to define McDonald\u2019s as the company that\u2019s made America fat,\u201d he said.The new marketing campaign, \u201cOur Food, Your Questions,\u201d is an attempt by McDonald\u2019s to take back its story. Consumers can watch short videos that answer questions such as whether each Egg McMuffin is made from a freshly cracked egg \u2014 it is \u2014 and \u201cWhat\u2019s in a Chicken McNugget?\u201d (meat from the chicken breast, tenderloin and ribs ground with a small amount of chicken skin).But marketing experts question whether that effort is working the way McDonald\u2019s intended. Consumers pointed out, for instance, that McDonald\u2019s uses 19 ingredients to make its famous fries in the United States, including dextrose and dimethylpolysiloxane, when only five ingredients go into its fries in Britain.\u201cTransparency\u2019s fine,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anybody, and especially moms, wants to see big slabs of beef being ground into hamburger.\u201dThat new marketing campaign comes straight from Mr. Easterbrook\u2019s English playbook, and it seems to be a sign that the company intends to do a better job of controlling its own message. Also on that agenda in Las Vegas last week: \u201cChange the conversation about McDonald\u2019s: Counterattack brand disparagers with continuous positive news on food quality and employment image.\u201dThat Mr. Easterbrook\u2019s first big marketing move was about fundamentals \u2014 how McDonald\u2019s products are made \u2014 indicated that he was reaching for the halo floating above some of his rival companies.But how much can McDonald\u2019s afford? The chicken meat raised with fewer antibiotics will cost more. And while the company doesn\u2019t expect those costs to be passed on to consumers now \u2014 many factors go into pricing any particular menu item \u2014 if it wants to compete in the \u201csustainable, local, build your own meal\u201d space of Smashburger, Shake Shack or Panera Bread, it won\u2019t come cheap.\u201cIt can\u2019t be all things to all people,\u201d Mr. Donahue said. \u201cIt has to decide.\u201d McDonald\u2019s can\u2019t afford to let high-quality ingredients price out its core customers. It can\u2019t afford to miss out on an affluent market that wants high-quality ingredients. And it certainly can\u2019t afford to make any of those customers wait a second longer.Because of an editing error, an article on March 8 about McDonald\u2019s efforts to turn around its flagging performance erroneously attributed a distinction to the company. While it is among the world\u2019s largest restaurant chains, with 36,000 outlets globally, it is not the largest. Subway, with more than 43,000 outlets worldwide, is larger.Advertisement"}

He clearly doesn\u2019t want negotiations and failed to suggest any reasonable alternative approach that could halt Iran\u2019s nuclear efforts. Moreover, he appeared to impose new conditions, insisting that international sanctions not be lifted as long as Iran continues its aggressive behavior, including hostility toward Israel and support for Hezbollah, which has called for Israel\u2019s destruction. Mr. Netanyahu has two main objections. One is that an agreement would not force Iran to dismantle its nuclear facilities and would leave it with the ability to enrich uranium and, in time, to produce enough nuclear fuel for a bomb. Two, that a deal to severely restrict Iran\u2019s ability to produce nuclear fuel for a decade or more is not long enough. He also dismisses the potential effectiveness of international inspections to deter Iran from cheating. While an agreement would not abolish the nuclear program, which Iran says it needs for power generation and medical purposes, neither would walking away. Even repeated bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear plants would not eliminate its capability because Iran and its scientists have acquired the nuclear know-how over the past six decades to rebuild the program in a couple of years. The one approach that might constrain Iran is tough negotiations, which the United States and its partners Britain, France, China, Germany and Russia have rightly committed to. If an agreement comes together, it would establish verifiable limits on the nuclear program that do not now exist and ensure that Iran could not quickly produce enough weapons-usable material for a bomb. The major benefit for Iran is that it would gradually be freed of many of the onerous international sanctions that have helped cripple its economy. While no Iranian facilities are expected to be dismantled, critical installations are expected to be reconfigured so they are less of a threat and the centrifuge machines used to enrich uranium would be reduced. Iran would be barred from enriching uranium above 5 percent, the level needed for power generation and medical uses but not sufficient for producing weapons-grade nuclear fuel. Absent a negotiated agreement, Iran will continue with its program without constraints. Mr. Netanyahu also denounced Iran\u2019s Islamic regime and the danger it poses to Israel and to regional stability through its support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Shiite militias in Baghdad, rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran\u2019s behavior is often threatening and reprehensible, and that is precisely why Mr. Obama has invested so much energy in trying to find a negotiated solution. But a major reason for Iran\u2019s growing regional role is the American-led war that toppled Saddam Hussein in Iraq, which Mr. Netanyahu supported, although he was not prime minister at the time. Even after a nuclear agreement is signed, some sanctions connected to Iran\u2019s missile and nuclear programs will remain in place. Despite his commitment to negotiations, President Obama has repeatedly said he would never let Iran obtain a nuclear weapon and if an agreement is not honored, he would take action to back up his warning. Mr. Netanyahu obviously doesn\u2019t trust him, which may be the most dangerous truth of this entire impasse.Congress must not forget that its responsibility is to make choices that advance American security interests, and that would include a strict and achievable agreement with Iran. If it sabotages the deal as Mr. Netanyahu has demanded, it would bear the blame.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Cuts Interest Rates to Stimulate Slowing Economy", "Date": "2015-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 With its growth engine slowing, China said on Saturday that it was reducing the nation\u2019s benchmark interest rates for the second time in three months.In an announcement on its website, China\u2019s central bank said that, effective Sunday, the one-year bank lending rate would drop 0.25 percentage point to 5.35 percent and that deposit rates would also be reduced by a quarter percentage point.The move, which will make it cheaper to borrow money, comes as policy makers search for ways to stimulate the economy while also promoting overhauls aimed at allowing market forces to play a greater role in the country\u2019s development.China already has the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States. And during much of last year, it was expanding about 7.5 percent. But late in the year, momentum slowed considerably, raising concerns that growth targets would not be met and that a deeper downturn was possible.In the fourth quarter of last year, growth dipped to 7.3 percent, the slowest rate in more than two decades. And in January, China\u2019s consumer price index slid to 0.8 percent, its weakest showing since late 2009.Economists are now pressing the People\u2019s Bank of China to ease its monetary policy in the hope of bolstering growth.\u201cChina\u2019s real economic activity has slowed further in recent months, largely due to the ongoing property downturn,\u201d Wang Tao, an economist at UBS, wrote last week in a report to clients. \u201cWeak domestic demand has aggravated excess capacity issues in many sectors, and together with a sharper decline in commodity and oil prices, have led to rapid disinflation, and for the industrial sector, deeper deflation. Against this backdrop, it would seem clear that monetary policy in China should be eased more aggressively.\u201dThrough much of last year, the government seemed to resist calls for economic stimulus packages and monetary easing out of fear that the policies might lead to a repeat of the events of 2009, when a vast government stimulus effort pumped up growth but also led to soaring debt for corporations and local governments.There were also concerns among some experts that a stimulus package or monetary easing would aid inefficient companies and allow companies to pile on even more debt.But a sluggish property market and signs of deflationary pressure have become urgent concerns in a country that has benefited from nearly two decades of spectacular growth, analysts say.The government has tried to make it easier for small business to obtain loans and allowed China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, to weaken against the dollar, aiding exporters.In November, for the first time in two years, the government reduced interest rates. In February, it lowered the reserve requirement ratio, allowing banks to lend a larger share of their assets. The move on Saturday to cut rates again is an effort to reduce corporate debt burdens and financing costs for borrowers and home buyers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bills on \u2018Religious Freedom\u2019 Upset Capitols in Arkansas and Indiana", "Date": "2015-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLITTLE ROCK, Ark. \u2014 The Arkansas legislature on Tuesday passed its version of a bill described by proponents as a religious freedom law, even as Indiana\u2019s political leaders struggled to gain control over a growing backlash that has led to calls to boycott the state because of criticism that its law could be a vehicle for discrimination against gay couples. The Arkansas bill now goes to the state\u2019s Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, who expressed reservations about an earlier version but more recently said he would sign the measure if it \u201creaches my desk in similar form as to what has been passed in 20 other states.\u201d But the bill already faces a significant corporate backlash, including from Doug McMillon, the chief executive of Walmart, the state\u2019s largest corporation, who said Tuesday afternoon that Mr. Hutchinson should veto it.Mr. Pence has said he wants to modify the law, but he has not indicated how he could do so without undermining it. He rejected claims that it would allow private businesses to deny service to gay men and lesbians and said the criticism was based on a \u201cperception problem\u201d that additional legislation could fix. \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that it would be helpful to move legislation this week that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses the right to discriminate against anyone,\u201d Mr. Pence, a Republican, said at a news conference in Indianapolis. He acknowledged that the law had become a threat to the state\u2019s reputation and economy, with companies and organizations signaling that they would avoid Indiana in response. Mr. Pence said he had been on the phone with business leaders from around the country, adding, \u201cWe want to make it clear that Indiana\u2019s open for business.\u201dThe bill in Arkansas is similar to the Indiana law, with both diverging in certain respects from the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. That act was passed in 1993 and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, Arkansas\u2019s most famous political son. But the political context has changed widely since then. The law was spurred by an effort to protect Native Americans in danger of losing their jobs because of religious ceremonies that involved an illegal drug, peyote. Now the backdrop is often perceived to be the cultural division over same-sex marriage. Both states\u2019 laws allow for larger corporations, if they are substantially owned by members with strong religious convictions, to claim that a ruling or mandate violates their religious faith, something reserved for individuals or family businesses in other versions of the law. Both allow religious parties to go to court to head off a \u201clikely\u201d state action that they fear will impinge on their beliefs, even if it has not yet happened. The Arkansas act contains another difference in wording, several legal experts said, that could make it harder for the government to override a claim of religious exemption. The state, according to the Arkansas bill, must show that a law or requirement that someone is challenging is \u201cessential\u201d to the furtherance of a compelling governmental interest, a word that is absent from the federal law and those in other states, including Indiana.\u201cIt has way too broad an application,\u201d said John DiPippa, a professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock law school, who had spoken before the legislature in 2011 on behalf of a narrower and ultimately unsuccessful version of the bill. \u201cI never anticipated or supported applying it to for-profit companies and certainly never anticipated it applying to actions outside of government.\u201d Though Arkansas has now joined Indiana as a target of criticism from businesses, condemnation of Indiana\u2019s law continued to grow.Days before the N.C.A.A. is to hold the men\u2019s basketball Final Four in Indianapolis, the group\u2019s president, Mark Emmert, said Tuesday that the new law \u201cstrikes at the core values of what higher education in America is all about.\u201d The city\u2019s mayor, Greg Ballard, a Republican, and the state Chamber of Commerce have called on lawmakers to change the statute.Business executives, notably leaders of tech companies like Apple and Yelp, have spoken out against the law, and Angie\u2019s List cited it in canceling plans to expand its facilities in Indianapolis. Entertainers have canceled tour dates in the state, a gaming convention is considering going elsewhere and the governors of Connecticut, New York and Washington have imposed bans on state-funded travel to Indiana.On the other hand, likely Republican presidential contenders \u2014 prominent among them Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio \u2014 have supported the law.Even the White House joined in. \u201cThis piece of legislation flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Tuesday at his daily briefing. Mr. McMillon of Walmart, in a statement, said the bill in Arkansas \u201cthreatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state,\u201d while the chief executive of Acxiom, a marketing technology company based in Little Rock that employs nearly 1,600 statewide, described the bill as \u201ca deliberate vehicle for enabling discrimination.\u201d Governor Hutchinson, a pragmatic Republican who ran on a jobs platform, said in an earlier statement that he was \u201cpleased that the legislature is continuing to look at ways to assure balance and fairness in the legislation.\u201d But with the votes on Tuesday, the decision now lies with him whether this balance has been effectively struck. His office was quiet on Tuesday, with a spokesman declining to comment, though the governor did meet in the morning with Democratic legislators who had concerns about the bill.The future of similar measures elsewhere remained unclear. In Georgia, where the legislature will adjourn for the year on Thursday, opponents of a pending proposal rallied Tuesday outside the State Capitol. Although the bill\u2019s path has been turbulent \u2014 a Monday committee hearing about the measure was canceled \u2014 supporters and critics alike said it could be approved in the session\u2019s final hours. North Carolina is far earlier in its debate. Religious freedom proposals surfaced last week in both the House and the Senate, and neither has faced a vote at even the committee level.In Indiana, lawmakers are expected to go to a conference committee as early as Wednesday morning. They are likely to use an unrelated bill as a vehicle to create the clarification Mr. Pence has requested. Aides to lawmakers said they expected passage to happen as early as Thursday, but it is not certain that a measure acceptable to the legislature will be acceptable to critics.And supporters of the laws urged political leaders not to bend to pressure. Micah Clark, executive director of the American Family Association of Indiana, said he feared \u201ca capitulation that enshrines homosexual behavior as a special right in Indiana.\u201d Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said, \u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t force religious businesses and churches to participate in wedding ceremonies contrary to their owners\u2019 beliefs.\u201dProponents of Arkansas\u2019s bill insisted that there was no intent to discriminate against gays and lesbians, pointing out that there had been several previous attempts to pass such a law well before same-sex marriage came to be seen as nearly inevitable. \u201cThe whole gay issue really was not a big discussion four years ago,\u201d said Jerry Cox, the president of the Family Council, an Arkansas-based lobbying group. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t discussed that much two years ago but for whatever reason that has been the focal point of the legislation this time.\u201dCritics of the law countered that the same legislators who presented this bill sponsored another law earlier in the session that forbids towns and cities to pass their own anti-discrimination ordinances, a law that scuttled ordinances that would have protected gays and lesbians. Mr. Hutchinson did not sign that bill when it came to his desk, but allowed it to become law.As late as Tuesday afternoon, legislators who opposed the bill in Arkansas were trying to add amendments clarifying that it could not be used to discriminate against gays and lesbians, similar to what political leaders in Indiana are considering. But the sponsors of the legislation refused those amendments during the legislative process and on Tuesday dismissed them as last-minute efforts to kill the bill.\u201cAll the way through this I thought it was unnecessary because of the fact that it didn\u2019t do everything that everybody was saying it was doing,\u201d Representative Bob Ballinger, a Republican and the chief sponsor of the bill, said in the minutes after the bill\u2019s successful passage. \u201cIn hindsight maybe I would have done it to maybe avoid all the pain.\u201dCampbell Robertson reported from Little Rock, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York.

{"Headline": "The Rub: Remodel or Move?", "Date": "2015-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNeil Shapiro considers himself \u201cwithin shouting distance\u201d of retirement. He and his wife could have sold their home near Chicago and bought a condo in the Sun Belt, long a lure for American retirees.Instead, the couple bought another single-family home \u2014 in Boise, Idaho.\u201cWe wanted to come to a place where we want to live, and work for a few more years,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. A city with an active economy was also important, he said, so that \u201conce I do retire, if I get bored out of my mind, there will probably be employment opportunities.\u201dA wave of retirements among baby boomers in the coming decades will have a big impact on residential real estate, in ways that are upending some conventional assumptions. Baby boomers are working longer or opting for \u201cphased\u201d retirements, in which they work at least part time after leaving their primary careers. They are changing the definition of a \u201cretirement\u201d locale, driving migration to cities that have not only affordable housing and recreational opportunities, but also robust economies that can support jobs. It\u2019s still true, however, that most retirees adamantly prefer to stay in their homes and communities as they age, rather than relocate. This group is choosing to alter their homes to make them easier to navigate, rather than sell them and downsize.And while the boomers nearing retirement age are generally too young to need assisted living facilities or similar housing, they already are having an impact on that market: They are influencing how and where those properties are built, as the decision makers on behalf of their parents.\u201cMultiple trends are happening at the same time,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the National Association of Realtors.While the list includes plenty of Sun Belt cities in Florida and Arizona, it also includes less obvious locations like Boise, as well as Raleigh, N.C.; Greenville, S.C.; Chattanooga, Tenn.; and McAllen, Tex., in part because housing in such places is relatively affordable and taxes are low. Such housing markets are attractive to baby boomers, who are moving en masse toward retirement age but don\u2019t necessarily want to stop working all at once. \u201cThey can trade down, using equity in their home to fund their retirement lifestyle,\u201d Mr. Yun said. But they can also find work, if needed, to supplement their retirement savings. Mr. Shapiro, 61, said Boise filled the bill. He and his wife, Rhonda Imhoff, 53, enjoyed living in Northbrook, Ill., a northern Chicago suburb with excellent schools, and partaking of the city\u2019s cultural resources while their children were young. \u201cWe enjoyed all the benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we paid for them,\u201d both financially, in stiff property taxes, and in traffic-laden commutes. They started visiting Boise when Ms. Imhoff\u2019s oldest daughter decided to attend Boise State University. Ms. Imhoff had grown up in Boise, but hadn\u2019t lived there for decades and was pleasantly surprised to learn that the city had grown and changed. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally different place now,\u201d she said. The city of about 214,000 people has a Shakespeare festival, and residents can see touring Broadway shows and attend sporting events at the university. In Boise, the couple bought a single-family ranch-style home with three bedrooms: \u201cWe weren\u2019t ready to completely downsize,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. Yet the equity from the sale of their home in Chicago enabled them to buy the house with little debt, and property taxes in Boise are $10,000 less than they were in Illinois. \u201cThat\u2019s real money,\u201d he said.On a recent weekend, while temperatures dropped to frigid levels back east, the couple hopped on their bicycles and rode 15 minutes in 70-degree weather to attend a college basketball game.They kept an eye on their future needs, however, when house hunting. \u201cOne of our nonnegotiable demands was that it had to be a single-level home,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said, so they would not have to worry about climbing stairs when they were older. And although they chuckled nervously about it, they also made sure its hallways were \u201cwide enough for a wheelchair.\u201d Such concerns are driving another trend, as retiring boomers who do not want to relocate seek to adapt their homes to their changing needs.Most people over age 65 say they prefer to stay in their own homes as they age, according to the advocacy group AARP. And indeed, people over 65 are far less likely to move (4 percent) in a given year than those under 65 (13 percent), according to the federal Administration on Aging. Those who do move usually stay in the same county or state; only 19 percent of older movers, for instance, moved out of state or abroad from 2012 to 2013. That suggests many homes are in for significant remodeling. \u201cA lot of work has to be done,\u201d said Kermit Baker, director of the center\u2019s Remodeling Futures Program.It\u2019s already starting to happen in some areas. Some markets with high concentrations of people aged 55 to 64 report high spending on home improvements by households of people in that age group, the Harvard center found. And spending on home improvement in 2013 was modestly higher among owners in that age group who had lived in their homes 20 years or more.David Tate and his wife, Carol, both 65, of Yorktown, Va., retired five years ago from careers in the health care field. They considered moving or downsizing, he said, but ultimately decided they wanted to stay put. Their grown children, and their grandchildren, live close enough for frequent visits, and their five-bedroom home provides plenty of space for them to stay. They also relish the change of seasons, as well as the area\u2019s rich history: Mr. Tate enjoys volunteering as a docent at the Yorktown Victory Center, as well as visiting Colonial Williamsburg and Jamestown. Once they made the decision to remain, they started thinking hard about the 42-year-old, two-story home where they have lived for the last 28 years. \u201cIt was built with the needs of a family in mind,\u201d he said, not those of an older couple. From their career experiences \u2014 Mr. Tate had worked at onetime as a long-term care executive, and his wife was a nurse \u2014 they knew that the right design elements could make a home much more livable for aging residents.\u201cWe knew things like, when you\u2019re older, you need more light to see,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd grab bars in the shower are essential.\u201dThey found a contractor who is certified in \u201caging in place\u201d remodeling, Robert Criner, to help them redesign a bathroom with an eye toward the future. The new shower has a low curb that is easy to step into, along with a shower bench and a removable shower head that can be used while seated. The new toilet is higher, making access easier, and it has more space around it to make it easier for someone else to assist with rising and sitting, if necessary.Since older people often feel the cold more severely, features were added to warm up the bathroom, like radiant heating in the floors. One day this winter, the outside temperature was 17 degrees, but the floor was a toasty 84, Mr. Tate said.Although the couple had paid off their mortgage, they took out a home equity line of credit to help fund the $59,000 project, Mr. Tate said. Yet some accommodations can be made relatively inexpensively, Mr. Criner said. For instance, doorways do not necessarily have to be widened to admit a wheelchair; in some cases, doors can be fitted with offset hinges, which swing the doors outward when they are opened, adding a couple of extra inches without any demolition.It also helps to compare the cost of needed changes with other options, like moving. One client decided adding an elevator, while expensive, was actually the least costly alternative. \u201cIt may be \u2018expensive,\u2019 but compared to what?\u201d Mr. Criner noted. \u201cCompared to building a mother-in-law suite on the first floor, it\u2019s cheaper.\u201dStill, couples should be realistic about the cost of remodeling. One type of house that often is not salvageable is a split level, with stairs going both up and down. \u201cI tell them to move,\u201d said Susan Bachner, a home modification consultant in Lexington, Ky. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get your money out of it.\u201dIt might seem that retiring boomers would create demand for senior housing and assisted living facilities. But right now, they are generally too young for such options, said Beth Mace, chief economist with the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care. The average age of residents in such facilities is 84, while the oldest boomers are now 69 (the baby boom generation is generally considered to be those born from 1946 to 1964), so they generally will not create serious demand for these properties for another decade or more.However, she said, boomers do influence the market for such properties in an important way: \u201cThey\u2019re the adult children of today\u2019s residents.\u201d It\u2019s often an adult daughter or son who makes the decision to move a parent into a senior property, and typically they like their parents to be relatively close to where they live \u2014 ideally, within a 10-minute drive \u2014 so they can stop by and visit. \u201cThis \u2014 the adult child influence \u2014 is one significant demand driver for seniors\u2019 housing,\u201d she said.So properties are often being developed in population centers where jobs are concentrated, Ms. Mace said, \u201ccatering to adult children bringing a parent back\u201d from a retirement location.

{"Headline": "Skills in Flux", "Date": "2015-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeveral years ago, Doug Lemov began studying videos of excellent teachers. He focused not on their big strategies but on their microgestures: How long they waited before calling on students to answer a question (to give the less confident students time to get their hands up); when they paced about the classroom and when they stood still (while issuing instructions, to emphasize the importance of what\u2019s being said); how they moved around the room toward a student whose mind might be wandering.Leslie notes that the Los Angeles school system tabulated the performance of roughly 6,000 teachers, using measures of student achievement. The best performing teacher in the whole system was a woman named Zenaida Tan. Up until that report, she was completely unheralded. The skills she possessed were invisible. Meanwhile, less important traits were measured on her evaluations (three times she was late to pick up students from recess).This raises an important point. As the economy changes, the skills required to thrive in it change, too, and it takes a while before these new skills are defined and acknowledged. For example, in today\u2019s loosely networked world, people with social courage have amazing value. Everyone goes to conferences and meets people, but some people invite six people to lunch afterward and follow up with four carefully tended friendships forevermore. Then they spend their lives connecting people across networks. Similarly, people who can capture amorphous trends with a clarifying label also have enormous worth. Karl Popper observed that there are clock problems and cloud problems. Clock problems can be divided into parts, but cloud problems are indivisible emergent systems. A culture problem is a cloud, so is a personality, an era and a social environment. Such people tend to possess negative capacity, the ability to live with ambiguity and not leap to premature conclusions. They can absorb a stream of disparate data and rest in it until they can synthesize it into one trend, pattern or generalization. Such people can create a mental model that helps you think about a phenomenon. As Oswald Chambers put it, \u201cThe author who benefits you most is not the one who tells you something you did not know before, but the one who gives expression to the truth that has been dumbly struggling in you for utterance.\u201dWe can all think of many other skills that are especially valuable right now:One gets the impression we\u2019re confronted by a giant cultural lag. The economy emphasizes a new generation of skills, but our vocabulary describes the set required 30 years ago. Lord, if somebody could just identify the skills it takes to give a good briefing these days, that feat alone would deserve the Nobel Prize. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Targeting Inequality, This Time on Public Transit", "Date": "2015-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATAC, Wash. \u2014 On Sunday, the county transit system for the Seattle metropolitan area began hurtling down a road that few cities have traveled before: pricing tickets based on passengers\u2019 income.The project, which is being closely watched around the nation, gives discounts on public transportation to people whose household income is no more than 200 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 for instance, $47,700 or less for a family of four under the 2014 guidelines. The problem it addresses is that many commuters from places like SeaTac, an outlying suburb, are too poor to live in Seattle, where prices and rents are soaring in a technology-driven boom. If they are pushed out so far that they cannot afford to get to work or give up on doing so, backers of the project said, Seattle\u2019s economy could choke.\u201cIt\u2019s people doing really well, and people making espresso for people who are doing really well,\u201d he said.At 12:01 a.m. on Sunday, buses, trains and passenger ferries in the county began charging only $1.50 per ride \u2014 more than 50 percent off peak fares \u2014 to riders like Basro Jama, who lives in Tukwila, just south of Seattle. ORCA Lift is run by King County Metro Transit, but the discount will apply to all passenger public transit in the county, including that of other agencies, like Sound Transit. But at least for the moment, all eyes are on Seattle, transportation experts said.\u201cWhat Seattle has done is what others might consider,\u201d said Art Guzzetti, vice president for policy at the American Public Transportation Association. \u201cEveryone is watching.\u201dThe distinctions start with scale and ambition: King County has about two and a half times San Francisco\u2019s population, and in aiming for enrollment numbers San Franciscans could only dream of, it is relying on what transit experts say is the most innovative idea of all: tools honed by the Affordable Care Act. A countywide system of more than 40 health clinics, food banks, community colleges and other sites run by nonprofit groups was put together to enroll residents in health insurance, and those partners were re-enlisted in the last few weeks to start registering people for ORCA Lift. Ms. Jama said yes. She also happened to have a recent pay stub in her pocket, verifying her income. Fifteen minutes later, she had the card in her hand. Though it works like a regular transit pass, the card will remove only $1.50 for a fare. It is good for two years without the need for users to reconfirm their income. County officials said they did not anticipate big wage increases.\u201cWhat\u2019s the trick in it?\u201d Ms. Jama asked softly, glancing down at the card and up at Amy Samudre, the program manager at Global to Local who had processed her application.\u201cNo trick,\u201d Ms. Samudre replied with a little shrug.The discount ORCA Lift provides might sound trivial to some, but for Ms. Jama, it is clearly not. The $10 or more a week that she will save on commuting represents a raise of almost 2.5 percent in her take-home pay. She said she might use the money for a special treat.\u201cThat\u2019s like taking my kids to McDonald\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo Happy Meals is $9.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Militants, ISIS Included, Claim\u00a0Tunisia Museum Attack", "Date": "2015-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 The Islamic State and other extremists on Thursday sought to claim responsibility for the deadly attack that killed at least 21 people at the National Bardo Museum in Tunis. The authorities there arrested at least nine people suspected of being accomplices as major cruise lines indefinitely suspended stops in Tunisia, a sign of the looming toll on the crucial tourist industry.The assault was the latest evidence that the extremist victories and cruelties in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere are emboldening like-minded militants to acts of violence around the world \u2014 including recent attacks in Paris, Ottawa and Sydney, Australia.The eagerness of the Islamic State and other jihadists to associate themselves with the killings in Tunis underscored the looseness of their proliferating networks, recalling the distant ties to both the Qaeda and Islamic State networks among the assailants who attacked the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris two months ago.The massacre of tourists on Wednesday, scholars said, was in some ways a throwback to the tactics that older militant groups had relied on in the 1980s and \u201990s. But the attack also comes at a time when some Islamist militants elsewhere, most notably in Egypt, are gravitating to the idea that economic interests may be a vulnerable point they can exploit to destabilize governments.A statement about the attack posted by the Afriqiyah Media, a jihadi forum often used by Uqba bin Nafa, a Tunisian group linked to Al Qaeda, even included graphs and price charts to show the economic pain the museum assault had already inflicted.Celebrating \u201cthe sharp collapse of the Tunisian markets after a simple operation involving only two individuals,\u201d the statement asked, \u201cWhat do you think would happen if an organized attack happened, and simultaneously on several military, vital and tourist targets?\u201dSome analysts said they saw an ominous trend. \u201cThe shooting spree tactic is really catching on, and that is going to be a huge headache for security services around the world,\u201d said Will McCants, a scholar of Islamist militancy at the Brookings Institution, noting the similarities with recent attacks on the Canadian Parliament building and Charlie Hebdo.Brian Fishman, a researcher at the New America Foundation in Washington, said he, too, foresaw more low-tech assaults, \u201cbecause these attacks are easy.\u201dTunisian officials said Thursday that they had not yet found evidence tying either of the two gunmen to any known terrorist group. Both men were killed by security forces in a gunfight at the museum, and the authorities identified them as Yassine Laabidi and Hatem Khachnaoui, both Tunisian.Prime Minister Habib Essid said in an interview with the French radio network RTL that Mr. Laabidi had caught the attention of the country\u2019s intelligence agencies in the past, but not for \u201canything special.\u201dThe Tunisian authorities are working with other governments to learn more about the men\u2019s backgrounds and motives, he said, adding at a news conference later that Tunisia was obtaining military equipment from allies, including eight helicopters equipped for nighttime surveillance, to aid its hunt for militants. Mr. Essid did not specify which countries, but the United States has already approved the sale of a number of UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters to Tunisia.\u201cSuch operations take place in the U.S., in France, in Egypt,\u201d Mr. Essid said of the attack.The authorities said the Tunisian Army would be deployed to cities to bolster the police, and Mr. Essid asked Tunisians for their forbearance regarding searches and checkpoints.\u201cWe are now in a phase of chasing after some terrorists who contributed indirectly to yesterday\u2019s operation in the Bardo Museum,\u201d he said. \u201cThe citizens must deal with this process with the utmost good will.\u201dPresident Beji Caid Essebsi said in a statement that four of the nine suspects under arrest had direct connections to the attack. He did not specify the exact reasons leading to the arrest of the other five. News reports indicated that the police had also arrested members of the family of one of the gunmen.Separately, two Spanish tourists emerged Thursday from a hiding place inside the museum, according to news reports citing the Spanish foreign ministry. Tunisian health officials said at least two people who were wounded in the attack died overnight, raising the death toll to at least 21, not including the two gunmen.Tunisia, the Arab Spring\u2019s lone success, is seeking to consolidate its transition to democracy after the uprising four years ago that removed a longtime strongman, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.The government has struggled to defeat Islamist militant groups, based mainly in the area around Mount Chaambi near the Algerian border. At the same time, the simmering frustrations of many young men with a sputtering economy and police abuses, which continued after decades of autocracy, have helped make Tunisia a leading source of foreign fighters for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, in its battles in Syria and Iraq.Supporters of the Islamic State on Thursday circulated a terse audio statement from one of its media outlets claiming responsibility and naming the gunmen under the aliases Zakaria al-Tunisi and Abu Anas al-Tunisi.\u201cWe tell the apostates who sit on the chest of Muslim Tunisia: Wait for the glad tidings of what will harm you, impure ones, for what you have seen today is the first drop of the rain, God willing,\u201d the group said in the audio statement, according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, an organization that tracks extremist groups.\u201cYou will not enjoy security, nor be pleased with peace, while the Islamic State has men like these,\u201d the statement said.The statement offered no evidence that the group had played a role in the attack, and its claims could not be confirmed.The Islamic State was not the only group to seek to associate itself with the attack. Afriqiyah Media posted a more detailed message recounting the chronology. Yet much of what it listed could have been gleaned from news media reports, and some of its assertions contradicted the accounts of witnesses and Tunisian officials.Its message rendered the names of the gunmen as Yassin al-Obeidi and Sabr al-Khachnaoui, according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence Group. Photographs included in the message appeared to show the bodies of the attackers \u2014 young men with assault rifles, each lying in a pool of blood and wearing running shoes and casual clothes. Tunisian officials had said the attackers wore military uniforms.Instead of claiming responsibility, Afriqiyah Media at times appeared to tease the authorities. \u201cWe will not answer this now, in order to listen to more of your ridiculous analysis and your weeping and crying on television and radio, and to laugh more at the inefficiency of your apostate masters,\u201d it said.Most of all, the message reveled in the damage done to the Tunisian economy at such a bargain price. \u201cJust two Kalashnikovs, four hand grenades, and some bullets,\u201d Afriqiyah Media\u2019s statement said. \u201cThe total price did not exceed 4,000 dinars.\u201d\u201cInstead of spending 3,000 dinars to enter Libya via smuggling for the pursuit of martyrdom, you can purchase a weapon and attack in the heart of the state of the tyrant and kill its police and soldiers,\u201d the statement encouraged.Scholars of extremism said this attack harkened back to an earlier era of jihadi violence, like the massacre of more than 60 people outside an ancient temple in Luxor, Egypt, in 1997 by militants with assault rifles. Then, too, the extremists hoped that driving away tourists would undermine the economy and thus weaken and topple the state.Instead, the cruelty of the slaughter and the damage to the economy alienated average Egyptians and strengthened support for President Hosni Mubarak. The Luxor attack cleared the way for a decisive crackdown.Most extremists had accepted that attacks on tourists were \u201ca model that across the jihadi world has always failed,\u201d said Mokhtar Awad, a researcher at the Center for American Progress in Washington, but the Tunisian attackers appear to have dusted it off. \u201cIt shows they have obviously not thought it through,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are going to start to hate you.\u201dSome young Islamists in Egypt have also begun carrying out violent attacks against business interests as a means of bringing down the military-backed government. But they have so far mainly attacked empty buildings in an attempt to minimize casualties, seeking to avoid triggering a popular backlash or reinforcing the police state.The spectacular success of other extremists around the region, however, appears to have emboldened even amateurs.Their interest is visible on social media, where some aspiring jihadists have begun using the hashtag, in Arabic, \u201cLone Wolf.\u201dIn one Twitter message this week that appeared to come from Egypt, for example, a user who called himself roughly Abu Mos\u2019ab the Cairene laid out his dreams very plainly: \u201cBrothers, a very important request,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI want any video to learn how to shoot, or to learn how to use guns.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly in some passages to a message about the museum attack posted online by the Uqba ibn Nafi Battalion. The message was in the form of a written statement with photographs; it was not a video.Reporting was contributed by Mayy El Sheikh from Cairo, Carlotta Gall and Farah Samti from Tunis, Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A High School Where a Student Might Letter in Polo", "Date": "2015-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside WealthWhen the billionaire William I. Koch spent $60 million to start the Oxbridge Academy in West Palm Beach, Fla., he vowed to teach children \u201chow things get done in the real world.\u201d The real world of Oxbridge includes a full-motion flight simulator, locally sourced blackened mahi tacos prepared by the former sous-chef of the popular Il Bellagio Restaurant in West Palm Beach, and a MacBook Pro for every student. And, in the coming months, Oxbridge will start offering students the chance to play one of the games of nobility: polo. Oxbridge says the team is a response to the demands of its students and parents. It will be only the third high school polo program in the country. And contrary to the image of polo as the rarefied pastime of global playboys, with Champagne-soaked matches on the lawns of the Hamptons or Saint-Tropez, and $100,000 ponies, school officials say Oxbridge\u2019s polo team will serve as a great democratizer, bringing children of different economic backgrounds together in an effort to expand the sport.Mr. Parsons says 40 percent of Oxbridge\u2019s students get some form of financial aid to help pay its $25,000 tuition, and about a third of the total enrollment are students of color. He says students who don\u2019t play polo now could learn: The idea is to start with basic riding lessons and then graduate to polo and competitions.Still, at a time when many public schools, especially in Florida, are struggling for funding and basic class supplies, the notion of a high school polo team highlights the widening education gap emerging with the broader wealth divide. High-income families now spend, on average, seven times as much each year on education as lower-income families, up from four times as much in the 1970s, according to one study. From 2007 through 2011, while the broader economy was weak, enrollment at private schools with tuition averaging $28,340 jumped 36 percent, according to federal data.The Palm Beach County public school district, for example, was forced to postpone new roofs and school equipment for several schools last year because of what many parents and teachers say is a lack of money. Oxbridge\u2019s polo team began like the school itself, as a service for affluent parents. Mr. Koch, the billionaire energy magnate and younger brother of David and Charles Koch, the conservative political donors, may be better known for his sailing exploits and wine collecting than his politics. He founded Oxbridge in 2011 so his children could go to a school close to his Palm Beach home.\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to have to send them away to boarding school in the Northeast,\u201d Mr. Parsons said. \u201cSo he started Oxbridge.\u201dThe prep school, which sits on a 54-acre campus, covers grades nine through 12. It expects to reach its cap of 600 students in a few years, Mr. Parsons said.\u201cThe school is all about being in tune with the demands of our students,\u201d said Craig Sponsky, Oxbridge\u2019s athletic director.Oxbridge first got help from Tim Gannon, the co-founder of Outback Steakhouse (he created the famed Bloomin\u2019 Onion) and polo hall of fame member whose teams have won five U.S. Polo championships and three U.S. Open Polo championships. Mr. Gannon, who lives in Palm Beach, put the school in touch with the U.S. Polo Association, which advised it on starting a program.Nearby Wellington, the winter horse capital of the East Coast rich, offered a convenient training ground with its roughly 60 polo fields. Oxbridge students will learn basic riding, hunting, jumping and dressage at Wall Street Farm, a riding school in Boynton Beach. They will learn polo from Joey Casey, a former professional polo player who owns the Palm City Polo training grounds.The school will use the horses from Palm City and Wall Street, and supply lessons, helmets, jerseys and other basic equipment. (The students will have to supply their own boots and polo pants.)\u201cPolo is probably the cheapest sport we have,\u201d Mr. Parsons said.Cheap is relative in polo. Mr. Casey said helmets can cost about $500 each and \u201cdecent\u201d paddock boots can run as much as $500 a pair. An hourlong lesson typically costs $250. The students will receive a discounted rate, which the school will pay. But building a polo team in a matter of months may prove difficult. Mr. Casey said students often needed at least 10 or 20 riding lessons before they could even start learning the basics of polo. After that, it takes months to learn to play polo at a competitive level.Yet polo is thriving in the United States, as the growing numbers of newly rich yearn for the trappings of old money and more women and students turn to a sport traditionally dominated by older males.

{"Headline": "E.C.B. Bond-Buying Program Is \u2018Pointing in the Right Direction,\u2019 Draghi Says", "Date": "2015-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn addition, he said, borrowing costs for eurozone governments have fallen since the European Central Bank began signaling last year that it was likely to begin buying government bonds to stimulate growth and push inflation from dangerously low levels.A recent decline in interest rates for Portugal and other countries occurred \u201cin spite of the renewed Greek crisis,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cThis suggests that the asset purchase program may be shielding other euro-area countries from contagion.\u201dAs the central bank snapped up sovereign debt, interest rates on the bonds continued to drop on Wednesday, with Germany\u2019s 10-year yield tumbling to a low of 0.213 percent and the yield in Portugal falling to a low of 1.674 percent. The bank\u2019s printing of euros to buy the bonds helped push the currency down to a 12-year low against the dollar, trading in late morning at $1.057.Mr. Draghi also predicted that downward pressure on inflation, which has fallen into negative territory, should ease by the end of the year. \u201cOn average, the latest news is positive,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.The conference at Goethe University in Frankfurt drew an especially critical audience. Germany is the center of opposition to the European Central Bank\u2019s policies, and Mr. Draghi was followed by Otmar Issing, former chief economist of the central bank and a leader among those who believe the purchases will create asset bubbles and give countries like Greece or Italy an excuse to delay necessary overhauls to their economies.\u201cThere is strong disagreement over what we can expect from this new measure,\u201d Mr. Issing said.At the event, Volker Wieland, a member of the German Council of Economic Experts, which advises the government on economic policy, said the new left-wing government in Greece has already provided evidence of how central bank stimulus is encouraging complacency among political leaders.By pushing down market interest rates on government debt, the asset purchases have reduced pressure on governments to control spending, critics say.The European Central Bank has \u201cgiven government room to delay reform,\u201d Mr. Wieland said. \u201cThe government in Greece has done its best to destroy investment opportunities. There were first signs of hope that have been destroyed.\u201dMr. Draghi left at the end of his speech and did not hear Mr. Wieland or Mr. Issing speak. However, he anticipated the criticism.\u201cThe beneficial impact of our asset purchases on financing conditions, rather than reducing the incentives for reforms, will actually increase the benefits of such reforms,\u201d Mr. Draghi said during his speech. \u201cFirms will be encouraged to increase investment, bringing forward the economic recovery. Effective, price-stability oriented monetary policy and structural reforms work hand in hand.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated a currency.

{"Headline": "Oil Company Lease Stirs Revolt in Green Seattle", "Date": "2015-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 The environmental messaging never stops here, whether from a city-owned electric utility that gets nearly 98 percent of its power from sources untainted by carbon (and is not about to let residents forget it) or the fussy garbage collectors who can write tickets for the improper sorting of recyclables. \u201cYou have signed a lease that will amount to a crime against the planet,\u201d said Zarna Joshi, 32, a Seattle resident who was first to speak at a raucous three-hour public meeting this week before the port\u2019s commissioners. The meeting was packed mostly with opponents and punctuated by the occasional dissenter, pointing out the hypocrisy of protesters who had arrived to denounce Shell in vehicles running on gasoline.Officials at the publicly owned port, which has branded itself as a global maritime gateway \u201cwhere a sustainable world is headed,\u201d have strongly defended the lease, saying the two-year contract would bring in millions of dollars of revenue and create hundreds of good jobs on 50 acres that Shell would use just west of downtown. The decision to allow oil exploration in Arctic waters is in any case federal policy, noted Peter McGraw, a port spokesman, not anything that the port or the city or the State of Washington can alter. \u201cThe port did everything right,\u201d said a lawyer for the Port of Seattle, Patrick J. Schneider, at a court hearing on Friday defending the lease. \u201cIt is an outstanding steward of the environment.\u201dAt the center of the dispute lies a tangle of questions about the politics of climate change. Since Shell will not be drilling or exploring for oil anywhere near Seattle, but merely parking for the night, so to speak, can or should the company be denied a berth because of what might or might not happen thousands of miles away off the north coast of Alaska, or what could take place years in the future if burning fossil fuels \u2014 maybe produced by Shell, maybe not \u2014 raises sea levels or causes other havoc? Lawyers for the port, in court filings, have said opponents are waging an \u201cintense\u201d political campaign that will falter on the rocks of a narrow contractual dispute.Opponents of the contract, though, said that protecting Seattle\u2019s environment, in the broadest sense, means taking on the fight everywhere. Whether there may be harm from greenhouse gases, or possible environmental damage from an oil spill or other accident in Alaska, to which Seattle is deeply connected in its economy and history, what Shell does in the Arctic, they say, will not stay there. \u201cHosting the Arctic drilling fleet in the city of Seattle is an activity that, if successful in drilling and extracting oil from the Arctic, will almost certainly mean that all of the industrial land in Seattle will be under water, and is completely inconsistent with the region\u2019s and even the port\u2019s goals,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Brien, a Seattle City Council member.Shell used a private shipyard here for repairing its arctic equipment in 2012, which required no public hearings. The difference this time is the involvement by the port, where the commissioners run for office and contracts are public documents. The city\u2019s Department of Planning and Development, under a request sent this week by the City Council and the mayor, is looking at whether the port\u2019s lease, signed with a local company, Foss Maritime, which would manage the terminal site with Shell as the tenant, is consistent with the legal designation of the terminal\u2019s use for \u201ccargo\u201d handling. That decision is expected in a few weeks.The judge, Mariane C. Spearman, pressed lawyers on both sides to explain what exactly Shell would be doing at the site and whether fears of environmental harm were real or speculative, particularly because the rigs are not actually here yet. She said she would rule within the next week whether the case could proceed.If the lease is revoked, there would probably not be another space on the waterfront big enough to hold the huge rigs, said Mr. O\u2019Brien, the City Council member. A spokesman for Shell, Curtis Smith, said the company had not looked at alternatives. The two rigs Shell plans to bring in \u2014 the Noble Discoverer and the Polar Pioneer \u2014 are enormous, one more than 320 feet tall and the other more than 500 feet long. Mr. Smith said the company also remained committed to exploring for oil in the far north. \u201cWe have reason to believe the acreage offshore Alaska is home to some of the most prolific, undeveloped hydrocarbon basins in the world,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cAs a result, we are advancing our plans to drill in Alaska in 2015 \u2014 dependent, of course, on successful permitting, clearing any legal obstacles and our own determination that we are prepared to explore safely and responsibly.\u201d\u201cIt is up to you whether you will be known as the commissioners who stayed true to their enthusiastically green campaign promises, or the commissioners who sold the planet to Shell Oil,\u201d he said, in demanding that the lease be revoked \u2014 within a deadline of two weeks. If that does not occur, he said, \u201cyour position will be clear, and we will take further public action.\u201dMr. Siadak declined in an interview to specify what action that might be.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reinventing the Mail Truck ", "Date": "2015-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsA United States Mail regulation wagon in front of the Boston post office building in 1895.ARLINGTON, Va. \u2014 On a recent snowy morning, Michael Ellis prepared his mail truck for the daily route he has run here for the last decade, through a neighborhood in the Washington suburbs.White, boxy mail trucks are a staple of neighborhoods across the country. But the aging vehicles \u2014 many date to the late 1980s \u2014 were built for a different era. They have no anti-lock brakes, airbags or even air-conditioning, and more important, the mail trucks simply are too cramped to carry the increasing number of packages postal carriers deliver.\u201cIt\u2019s been a good vehicle for me, but it just can\u2019t keep up anymore with what we need,\u201d Mr. Ellis said, pointing to the stacks of boxes in the back of his truck.Mr. Ellis, a mail carrier for nearly 29 years, remembers when the post office here received its first batch of the Grumman-bodied trucks around 1990. Back then, he said, they were a dream compared with the Ford Pinto he had been using.\u201cOh man, that Pinto, that was the worst,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cThese trucks were a big step up back then. But as with everything, times have changed.\u201dAlready, automakers are working to compete for the coveted contract, worth an estimated $6 billion to produce 180,000 vehicles. And although manufacturers declined to divulge details of their designs, the outlines of the mail truck of the future are emerging based on the requirements that the Postal Service has detailed.The biggest shift: Drivers must be able to stand up. With the rise in online retail sales, drivers are increasingly delivering packages, not just envelopes, and need more room in the back of the vehicle to store boxes and walk among them.To this end, the Postal Service has asked automakers to consider a \u201cfully enclosed van style body\u201d that would have internal cargo capacity and even sliding side doors.\u201cMost likely it\u2019ll be a van of some kind, but we\u2019re still early in the process,\u201d said Sarah Ninivaggi, a spokeswoman for the Postal Service. \u201cIt will definitely be larger and likely with a different shape than what we have now.\u201dAutomakers were told to make plenty of room in the back of the vehicle for packages, including shelving units and sorting machines to help ease access to the boxes during delivery.Those features would be welcome by Mr. Ellis and his fellow mail carriers, who in December alone delivered 524 million packages, an 18 percent increase over the previous year.\u201cIt would be great to be able to maneuver back there, to not have to step over parcels and be able to organize them better,\u201d he said. Recently, some makeshift shelves were installed to help, he said, but there simply is not enough room to work efficiently.Two weeks ago, the Postal Service met with automakers interested in building the vehicles, and the process \u2014 by government contract standards \u2014 was set to accelerate quickly. Companies will submit information by the middle of this month to be deemed \u201cqualified\u201d to bid. Those chosen will then formally bid and have their designs ready for postal officials by the summer.From there, officials will choose two or three versions, and automakers will produce working prototypes over the next six months, Ms. Ninivaggi said. The vehicles will be tested in real-world situations by postal workers and in other test situations, until the winner is decided. The new fleet is scheduled to begin operating in 2018.Some of the changes are aimed at simply bringing the truck in line with current standards. Among the new features the post office wants are not only items like airbags, but also backup cameras and warning systems, ergonomic seats and doors, and antiskid surfaces.Mr. Ellis, the Virginia postal carrier, showed how precarious the bare-metal footholds by the driver\u2019s door can get in the wintry weather. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to slip,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople started putting strips down to try and help, but even then.\u201dWhile the Postal Service is not claiming the new mail trucks will reduce the number of accidents, it does expect they will keep postal workers safer if they are in a crash. (It declined to provide recent accident figures.)Mr. Ellis said anti-lock brakes would be a welcome addition to help navigate wet and wintry weather. He also said the current trucks could get a little top-heavy toward the end of the day, when the truck was emptier, and a new design with improved weight distribution would help.\u201cThey can slide around a little, so you learn to be careful in those conditions,\u201d he said.Backing up is also a challenge. A large yellow sticker on the dashboard of Mr. Ellis\u2019s truck warns drivers to not back up unless necessary.\u201cI\u2019ll try to park where I never have to back up. But that\u2019s not always possible,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of us here asked about backup cameras, and thankfully that\u2019s been included in what the next truck will have.\u201dBetter fuel economy is paramount; the current trucks achieve only about 9 miles per gallon. In the 2014 fiscal year, the Postal Service spent $539 million over all just on fuel. The competition is open to alternative motors, like hybrid, natural gas, fuel cell or electric, if automakers can demonstrate they can do the job as well as internal combustion engines.The contract is a potential windfall for automakers, which in recent years have given their commercial fleet vehicles a significant overhaul.\u201cGetting the Postal Service contract all by itself could justify the expense of developing an entirely new model line,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst with Kelley Blue Book, adding that it takes on average about $1 billion to develop a new vehicle.Mr. Brauer said the aggressive push into the commercial van market over the last several years by the likes of Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Nissan meant they potentially could also adapt one of their platforms into the postal truck.Mercedes-Benz, whose Sprinter van was largely recognized as a significant leap forward when it debuted about a decade ago, now has competition, Mr. Brauer said, as automakers bet on corporate and government fleets being ready for a refresh after the recession.\u201cThey saw this coming and recognized they needed to up their game if they wanted to compete,\u201d he said.He also said the Postal Service \u201ccould be pressured to pick a domestic automaker, though that will be secondary to cost considerations.\u201dAutomakers would not say much about pursuing the postal contract. A spokesman for Fiat Chrysler said the company was reviewing the details provided by the Postal Service, \u201cbut beyond that, we\u2019re not commenting further.\u201dGeneral Motors said it was \u201cearly in the process of exploring potential solutions that would work\u201d for the postal vehicle. And Ford Motor said only that it was capable of \u201ccommercial-grade solutions that can be tailored to meet a wide variety of business or fleet needs.\u201dAs he stood near his truck in the cold morning air, Mr. Ellis said that although it had been a good partner for the last decade, one thing he would not miss was the vehicle\u2019s propensity for breakdowns. It\u2019s not uncommon for mail carriers to be stranded on their routes while waiting for repairs or a tow.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to even get parts for it anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when you know you\u2019re driving something old.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Monday was Niger\u2019s turn to do so. Chad\u2019s military spokesman hung up the phone when questioned about the discrepancy, though the spokesman, Col. Azem Bermandoa Agouna, did say that forces from the two neighboring countries were \u201cin coalition\u201d in the regional fight against Boko Haram.\u201cThe armed forces have launched themselves into the fight to recover the town,\u201d Colonel Azem said Monday from Ndjamena, the Chadian capital, referring to Damasak, a Boko Haram staging post for attacks.Control of the border towns has changed hands several times, and the situation in other remote towns in territory controlled by Boko Haram remains ambiguous. The Nigerian Army, which up until last month had conceded swaths of territory to the Islamist insurgents, is sensitive over the military assistance provided by its smaller neighbors.With a national election scheduled for March 28 and a pledge by military officials to stamp out Boko Haram before the vote, activity by Nigerian forces has intensified, as have efforts by the country\u2019s neighbors, who are worried about the effects of the insurgency on their economies. Boko Haram has increased cross-border raids into Cameroon, Chad and Niger in recent months.The attacks were grimly familiar, with women concealing explosives under their hijabs. In one attack on Saturday at Maiduguri\u2019s Monday Market, vigilantes forced a woman whom they suspected of carrying a bomb to the ground, only to be blown up as she detonated it. Nigerian reporters at another attack on Saturday at the Baga Fish Market noted that a number of the victims were children.Issa Ousseini contributed reporting from Niamey, Niger, and a correspondent for The New York Times from Maiduguri, Nigeria.Advertisement"}

But as her business has grown, she has been harshly criticized online and accused of mass-producing goods, of obtaining wares from China. Detractors consider her a blight on Etsy\u2019s hipster cred.As for Ms. Shaffer, she denies the claims that have dogged her business recently but says she understands why questions have arisen about the volume of goods she produces. She says her store strictly adheres to Etsy\u2019s guidelines, including that all items listed are either handmade or \u201cvintage\u201d secondhand, with some new exceptions that allow for approved outside manufacturing. \u201cWe\u2019re a team of dedicated Etsy artisans who have been able to grow a tiny shop into a little machine,\u201d she said.For many of its fans, Etsy is much more than a marketplace. They view it as an antidote to global mass production and consumption, and a stand against corporate branding. It\u2019s their vote for authenticity and good old craftsmanship, and a seemingly ethical alternative to buying from big corporations. And it has helped spur a wider industry of items, from bedsheets to beef jerky, that claim to be homespun, artisanal or or otherwise handmade.Though the site still loses money because of high development costs, it is booming, with gross merchandise sales reaching $1.93 billion last year. The fees Etsy collected on items listed and sold, as well as on services like the promoted placement of goods, reached $196 million.But criticism of the production methods of Three Bird Nest and other increasingly high-volume sellers, together with a string of defections by prominent vendors, reflect the company\u2019s struggles to balance growth with maintaining the indie credibility that fueled its popularity.Some sellers say they worry that the site could soon become overrun with knockoffs and trinkets. Others say Etsy\u2019s handmade ethos could soon become just a marketing gimmick, turning off shoppers drawn to the site\u2019s alternative appeal.Etsy grew out of a design project that three Brooklynites took on for an arts-and-crafts bulletin board. At the time, the indie craft scene was just starting up, and one of Etsy\u2019s founders, Rob Kalin, was an active participant, according to acquaintances. Etsy declared to shoppers it was building an entirely \u201cnew economy\u201d that would re-establish a personal connection between buyers and sellers, and it allowed its merchants to sell only things they made themselves.But as stores took off, sellers started to complain that one person could not possibly keep up with the flood of orders. The logical next step, they said, would be to take on investment and hire employees, or outsource the manufacturing, but doing so would run afoul of Etsy\u2019s rules.Still, Etsy stuck to its ban \u2014 Mr. Kalin was known to be a vocal opponent of easing it \u2014 until late 2013, when, under its new chief executive, Chad Dickerson, the site relaxed those standards. The change allowed sellers to hire workers or outsource the production to small-scale manufacturers that met a set of labor and ecological criteria. Almost 30 percent of sellers on Etsy took part in support groups in 2014, according to Etsy\u2019s I.P.O. prospectus, and there are already over 5,000 instances of Etsy sellers outsourcing their manufacturing. The company said 6 percent hired paid help in 2013, the most recent year that statistic was available.According to Alibaba, the necklace is made by the Yiwu Shegeng Fashion Accessories Firm, based south of Shanghai, which claims that it can churn out almost 80 million similar necklaces a month. Jacky Wang, listed as the company\u2019s chief executive, did not return requests for comment.\u201cIt\u2019s like having a gourmet restaurant on a street with upscale galleries, bookshops and coffee shops, and a McDonald\u2019s or a Walmart gets built in a vacant lot on the street,\u201d said Diane Marie, an artist who sells handmade jewelry from her home in La Pointe, Wis., and who has called out so-called \u201cresellers\u201d on Etsy\u2019s discussion forums.Etsy does police such cases, but it can be akin to playing whack-a-mole. Users can flag a suspected reseller to the site\u2019s Marketplace Integrity, Trust & Safety Team, and Etsy has also said it uses algorithms to detect suspicious sellers. But it acknowledges in its prospectus that it cannot fully vouch for the standards of its sellers and the manufacturers they work with. Some critics have questioned whether there is sufficient incentive to investigate or shut down sellers that generate big traffic and sales.\u201cI\u2019m all for ramping up production,\u201d said Ms. Bowskill, who now sells 40 to 50 cloths a month at $50 each. \u201cEtsy shouldn\u2019t be about one person crafting goods all by herself with no sleep,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re building a viable business, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re mass-manufacturing.\u201dEtsy declined to make officials available for interviews, citing the quiet period leading up to its stock offering. In its I.P.O. filing, however, Mr. Dickerson acknowledged concerns that Etsy is \u201cdiluting our handmade ethos\u201d by allowing sellers to work with manufacturers.\u201cAfter all, Etsy has always served as an antidote to mass manufacturing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still do.\u201dStill, its success, and perhaps its problems, have spurred a flurry of would-be Etsys, like Artfire, a community-based marketplace for handmade items. Artfire gained traction for a while \u2014 especially among disgruntled Etsy sellers, who started to migrate to the site \u2014 but many of those defectors soured when it started charging a monthly fee for hosting storefronts. DaWanda, an online bazaar based in Germany selling handmade and vintage products, is popular in Europe, but its sales are thought to amount to just a fraction of Etsy\u2019s.Nicole Burisch, a fellow with the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, who is editing a book about crafts and the global economy with the Canadian artist Anthea Black, said separating the handmade from the manufactured would always be tricky.Etsy sellers are frustrated, she said, because they had relied on the site to validate their work as \u201cgenuinely handmade.\u201d But distinguishing handmade items from mass-produced ones has become increasingly difficult, and is in fact a false distinction, she said, \u201cunless you are digging your own clay, weaving your own cloth, raising your own sheep.\u201dAn article on March 16 about a dispute over how goods are produced and sold on Etsy, an online market for handmade products, paraphrased incorrectly some comments on the matter by Nicole Burisch, a fellow with the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. She said it was increasingly difficult to distinguish handmade items from mass-produced ones. She did not raise a question about whether a hand-knit sweater or clay pot was handmade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Plan to Join China-Led Bank, Britain Opens Door for Others", "Date": "2015-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 A surprise decision this week by Britain to join China\u2019s new development bank for Asia, despite opposition from the Obama administration, will almost certainly encourage other American allies to become members, particularly Australia and South Korea, analysts said Friday.Britain\u2019s announcement Thursday that it intends to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which China is largely funding in hopes of becoming the dominant influence in Asian affairs, has bolstered the fledgling bank\u2019s reputation even before it begins operations, the analysts said.Britain said it wanted the new bank \u2014 which would provide financing for transportation, telecommunications and energy projects in developing countries across Asia \u2014 to address concerns about environmental standards and other lending safeguards before signing the final membership documents.But the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, made it clear Thursday that Britain was intent on joining, calling it \u201can unrivaled opportunity for the U.K. and Asia to invest and grow together.\u201dThe Chinese Finance Ministry warmly welcomed the British announcement, saying on its website on Friday that if all went well, Britain would formally become a \u201cprospective founding member\u201d of the bank by the end of March.Washington has expressed reservations about the new institution, on the grounds that it would not meet environmental standards, procurement requirements and other safeguards adopted by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank for their lending projects.The National Security Council in Washington implicitly criticized Britain\u2019s decision, in an indication that Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s conservative government had forged ahead with little if any consultation with the United States.\u201cThis is the U.K.\u2019s sovereign decision,\u201d a spokesman at the National Security Council said. \u201cWe hope and expect that the U.K. will use its voice to push for the adoption of high standards.\u201dSouth Korea and Australia, both of which count China as their largest trading partner, have seriously considered membership but have held back, largely because of forceful warnings from Washington, including a specific appeal to Australia by President Obama. Peter Drysdale, a professor of economics at Australian National University who has advised Australian governments, said the British decision would probably lead Australia to join.\u201cI think it will play into the decision by Australia which should be made over the next few weeks,\u201d Mr. Drysdale said Friday. He added that Australia, with its close economic ties to China, had more reason to join the bank than Britain and other European countries had.Prime Minister Tony Abbott\u2019s government decided against Australian membership late last year, citing national security considerations. In the weeks leading up to that decision, Mr. Obama spoke to Mr. Abbott and urged him against joining, a senior member of the Australian government said. Recently, however, the government has indicated that it is reconsidering.In South Korea, Britain\u2019s announcement is likely to reignite the government\u2019s internal debate about the merits of membership, said Hahm Chaibong, president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.\u201cIt will give a lot of ammunition to those who have been pushing for it,\u201d Mr. Hahm said. \u201cThe ministries of trade and finance have been for it. The United States has been unremittingly negative.\u201dHaving South Korea as a founding member would be a considerable coup for Beijing.

{"Headline": "Midrange Travel Choices Expanding in Asia", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDays before booking two weeks of temple-hopping in Vietnam and Cambodia last year, Karisa Kopaczewski and three of her friends came up with a twist. Let\u2019s try to find a beach for a couple of days and go home from there, they decided.A self-proclaimed Type-A traveler and no fan of last-minute changes, Ms. Kopaczewski hit the Internet. She quickly found a $30 one-way flight from Vietnam to the Malaysian island of Langkawi and a mid-range resort on sandy, palm tree-lined beach for $134 a night.\u201cCosts were so reasonable we decided, why not?\u201d said Ms. Kopaczewski, 32, an attorney based in Atlanta who writes a blog called Flirting With the Globe. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have happened a few years ago.\u201dTravelers like Ms. Kopaczewski and her friends are finding a much different travel experience in Asia, a region that has been known for extravagant five-star resorts and super-cheap one- or two- star choices \u2014 but little in between. Even as the region\u2019s luxury travel options continue to expand, companies around the world are racing to provide more midmarket choices, whether new hotels or the car-sharing service Uber battling it out with tuk tuk drivers and taxis.Asia\u2019s midrange travel industry is in the midst of a \u201cdramatic transformation,\u201d said Douglas Quinby, vice president of research for PhoCusWright, a travel industry consulting company. \u201cIt\u2019s still a very early market, very young.\u201d Helping to fuel the expansion is a new generation of travelers, especially those from mainland China, who are quickly becoming one of the world\u2019s largest groups of tourists. (The China National Tourism Administration recorded more than 107 million outbound trips in 2014, a 19.5 percent increase from 2013.)In China, \u201cnot only rich people are doing it,\u201d said Melissa Yang, co-founder of Tujia, a company based in Beijing that hopes to become the AirBnB of China. \u201cA lot of people are traveling for the first or second time.\u201dAcross the region, the increasing competition is creating more choices and more deals for travelers.Hannah and Adam Lukaszewicz, veteran budget travelers based in Chiang Mai, Thailand, were surprised at the choices when they decided to book a trip to Angkor Wat, Cambodia, a few months ago. They found a new boutique hotel near the Cambodian temple that offered a swimming pool, air-conditioning, cable TV and private bathroom for the equivalent of $25 a night. \u201cThere are way more affordable hotels\u201d in Asia than a few years ago, Ms. Lukaszewicz said. \u201cWe actually don\u2019t stay in hostels at all in Asia, because you can get a three-star hotel for 20 bucks.\u201dThe Lukaszewiczs, who write about their travels on GettingStamped.com, regularly take advantage of the new low-cost airlines flying in and out of Chiang Mai. A connection to Bangkok is typically about 970 Thai baht, or about $30. \u201cSometimes it can be cheaper than taking the overnight trains and buses,\u201d Ms. Lukaszewicz said.The number of passengers flying on smaller carriers in Asia has doubled since 2010, reaching 400 million a year, and is expected to reach 600 million by 2018, according to data compiled by Euromonitor. The growth has \u201copened up a lot of destinations,\u201d said Bill Barrett, managing director of C9 Hotelworks, a Thailand-based hotel industry consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to jump around.\u201dFares are also dropping, as both smaller carriers and large airlines look for new ways to lure passengers. In February, for example, AirAsia introduced its Asean Travel Pass, offering as many as 10 one-way flights in a 30-day period for about $160.At the same time, international hoteliers are rapidly expanding in the region. One growth area: so-called \u201cposhtels,\u201d upscale hostels offering simple dorms and private rooms in stylish surroundings, catering to thrifty travelers who still like high-thread-count sheets. The Singapore-based Radiance Hospitality Group and Lub D, in Bangkok, are among the companies expanding their poshtel offerings. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of innovation in the economy space,\u201d Mr. Barrett said. And familiar Western brands such as Intercontinental and the Accor Group, which includes the Ibis brand, have all announced aggressive expansion plans. Asia is also the fastest growing region for online vacation home listing services such as AirBnB and HomeAway. In Singapore, the AirBnB listings rose to 2,100 homes in 2014, a 260 percent increase over the previous year; in Japan the number quadrupled, to 5,600 listings. \u201cIn Tokyo demand is almost outstripping supply,\u201d said Nate Blecharczyk, AirBnB\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer.However, the services also are creating controversy. Faced with a wave of homes advertised online for vacation rentals, many cities, including Singapore, are considering new regulations to restrict the practice. \u201cThis is a new concept, wherever you go,\u201d Mr. Blecharczyk said. \u201cI expect cities to follow the same trajectory as in Europe or the U.S.\u201dIn China, several cities, including Beijing, have moved to ban Uber. Yet investment and, ultimately, more growth in such operations is continuing.Many travelers and travel experts also note that arranging trips has become a lot easier as more businesses in Asia adapt to life on the Internet and the websites of midrange and smaller businesses improve.\u201cOnline systems and Web-only fares are new to Asia,\u201d said Mimi Cassidy, co-owner of Moraga Travel, a travel agency in northern California. In the past she often relied on tour operators or regional contacts. But now the Internet \u201cis something I always check.\u201dThe fact that so many in Asia are focused on their mobile devices also has prompted travel companies to use Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to announce special prices and promotions, something that helps potential travelers elsewhere in the world. \u201cThat\u2019s where the best deals are coming from,\u201d Mr. Barrett said.For the Lukaszewiczs, who have more than 22,000 followers on Twitter, they say that all the changes have been readily apparent in their recent travels: ATMs available on remote islands and the online availability of an $18 room in the municipality of El Nido, in the Philippines\u2019 Palawan Islands. \u201cEven the mom-and-pop hotel with four rooms is now on Agoda,\u201d the online service, Ms. Lukaszewicz said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t there last year.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Where You Go Is Not Who You\u2019ll Be\u2019 and \u2018The End of College\u2019", "Date": "2015-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.If you have sat through a high school commencement ceremony in the past 25 years, you may have endured an earnest recitation of the last book written by Dr. Seuss, \u201cOh, the Places You\u2019ll Go!\u201d The book is a popular gift to graduates from grown-ups who have forgotten how late adolescents feel about condescension. Here are two deeply felt, intentionally provocative alternatives for college applicants worried about getting into their first choice and parents worried about paying for it: Frank Bruni\u2019s exhortation to go elsewhere and Kevin Carey\u2019s invitation to go online.Bruni argues that the first place some of us go \u2014 not to college generally but to a particular college \u2014 has less impact on identity, success and happiness than many suppose. What he calls the \u201cindustrialization of the college admission process\u201d in recent decades amounts to a speedup abetted by expensive personal coaches, proliferating online applications and the inevitable U.S. News & World Report rankings. He admits to \u201cbashing\u201d the last of these familiar and easy targets. \u201cI\u2019ll proceed to bash,\u201d he explains, \u201cbecause I believe passionately that the college experience can\u2019t be reduced in this fashion.\u201dPassion has been one of Bruni\u2019s trademarks on the New York Times Op-Ed page since 2011, particularly for this subject. \u201cI\u2019ve used my column,\u201d he writes in the book, \u201cto argue that education is so much more than brand.\u201d Regular readers may recognize bits of those columns that reappear here \u2014 such as the Yale applicant whose essay recalled being so enrapt by her teachers that she once urinated on herself rather than interrupt.Parents who always want the best for their brightest may not seek to be \u00adtalked out of that impulse, but Bruni tries to re-educate readers about what best really means. Arguing that motivated kids can get a good education almost anywhere, he lists Fortune 500 executives, Pulitzer Prize winners and MacArthur Foundation fellows who attended what he gingerly refers to as \u201cpublic universities and schools without major reputations.\u201d Of course, it\u2019s one thing to learn that unranked \u00adCollege\u202fX graduated a genius and quite another to gamble on its doing as well by your child, however far above average.Candid interviews with the likes of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (who went to the University of Delaware but sent his son to Princeton), Condoleezza Rice (a self-described \u201cfailed piano major\u201d at the University of Denver) and the CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour (a thwarted doctor who got her journalism degree from the University of Rhode Island) raise similar quibbles. Can you imagine any of those three being put at a disadvantage by their choice of college?This is actually Bruni\u2019s point: that the best education is less a matter of getting into the best school than of making the best of wherever you go. His most vivid examples and insights emerge from sensitive conversations with parents, applicants, guidance counselors, admissions officers \u2014 and especially recent graduates, thriving 20-somethings who now feel lucky to have been rejected by their preferred schools. Some who ended up far afield, geographically or demographically, discovered the educational and personal value of exceeding their comfort zones. Such was the case for Bruni himself, who, after growing up in the suburbs of Connecticut and New York, turned down his dream school, Yale, to accept a scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Reflecting on \u201cthe stories of many of the people happiest with the way things had turned out for them,\u201d Bruni pulls from them a few common threads, including \u201can openness to serendipity\u201d and \u201ca nimbleness in adapting to change, a willingness to shoot off in a new direction.\u201dKevin Carey urges nearly identical advice not on parents and students but on colleges and universities, which he believes have actively resisted transformation by information technology in order to maximize profit and preserve centuries-old privileges. An education wonk at the New America Foundation, with degrees (Bruni would want you to know) from Binghamton and Ohio State, Carey elegantly blends policy analysis, reportage and (briefly) memoir into a hard-charging indictment of the eggheads and ivory towers many Americans love to hate. While Bruni extols all the other places you could go, Carey believes that the time is nearly at hand when students won\u2019t need to go anywhere to learn everywhere.Part alternative history and part road trip, the book is a tour guide to higher education from Bologna, Italy, where the first modern university was founded in the late 11th century, to what the author rather breathlessly calls \u201cnew digital learning environments\u201d of the early 21st. Carey traces our present dilemma (frenzied competition for scarce berths at vastly overpriced institutions) to the 19th century, when a new trinity of \u201cpractical training, research and liberal arts education\u201d combined to form a \u201cstrange hybrid university.\u201d Over the past hundred years, he argues, efficient and economical education has been sacrificed to professorial autonomy in research and teaching and to high but elusive ideals of curricular breadth. Carey blames what he calls \u201cthe hybrid university administrative class\u201d \u2014 a vast, left-brained conspiracy of bureaucrats who have turned American higher education into \u201ca government-backed, culturally reinforced monopoly on the sale of increasingly valuable credentials.\u201d In other words, elite universities are fully accredited racketeers that employ intellectual and economic muscle to frighten parents into either paying protection money or risking something bad happening to their children.You have to admit he\u2019s got something there.He\u2019s also got a great sense of irony. Beyond noting that research conducted at \u201cthe best hybrid universities\u201d contributed greatly to the \u201cinformation technology revolution\u201d that might be hastening their demise, Carey delves into brain and learning science to point out that many of the same schools \u201cmade phenomenal contributions to the understanding of human cognition even as they steadfastly refused to apply those insights to their own philosophies and practices of teaching.\u201d Seeking out exceptional institutions, he spends time at a few where \u201clearning scientists and computer engineers,\u201d as well as entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, have been collaborating at \u201cthe cutting edge of learning technology.\u201d These include Stanford and especially Carnegie Mellon University. (Disclosure: I am on faculty at Carnegie Mellon, albeit teaching analog American history and relying on my degrees from the University of Iowa and Rutgers, the State University of New \u00adJersey.) When the new science of learning, new online business models and new kinds of verifiable, digital credentials converge, Carey concludes, \u201cthe cornerstone of the hybrid university economy will begin to crumble, and the University of Everywhere will take its place.\u201d The subtitle is perhaps the least clever thing about this readable and thoughtful book. From the start, Carey adopts a utopian or ominous (depending on your end of the tuition bill) tone that leads him to follow intriguing claims \u2014 \u201cAt the University of Everywhere, educational resources that have been scarce and expensive for centuries will be abundant and free\u201d \u2014 with silly ones: \u201cThe University of Everywhere will span the earth.\u201d Hyperbole sometimes distracts from his gift for finding fascinating characters and explaining complex ideas clearly.Ultimately, these are both utopian books. Perhaps Bruni speaks for both authors when he writes that \u201ccollege has the potential to confront and challenge some of the most troubling political and social aspects of contemporary life; to muster a pre-emptive strike against them; to be a staging ground for behaving in a different, healthier way.\u201d But he looks backward with nostalgia at what may be lost if Carey\u2019s futuristic vision materializes: the transformative experiences of different people learning in a room together.

{"Headline": "Netanyahu Says No to Statehood for Palestinians", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Netanyahu\u2019s chief challenger, Isaac Herzog of the center-left Zionist Union, backs the two-state solution and has promised to try to restart talks with the Palestinians, though he has warned an agreement may not be possible. He has, however, made Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s alienation of allies, especially Washington, a prime campaign point, and said Israel\u2019s international isolation is itself a security threat.With his conservative Likud Party trailing the Zionist Union in the last pre-election polls, Mr. Netanyahu has ratcheted up his statements in a panicky blitz of interviews and campaign stops in recent days. He accuses rivals of colluding with Arabs and moneyed antagonists in a global conspiracy to oust him. He has also belatedly begun to address the pocketbook questions that polls suggest will drive most people\u2019s votes.But in many corners, these efforts and the Palestinian flip-flop only underscore a longstanding critique: that Mr. Netanyahu, 65, who led Israel for three years in the 1990s and returned to the premiership in 2009, places staying in power above all else.The Israeli leader\u2019s settlement policy resembles his predecessors\u2019, but it is a march toward permanence at a time when prospects for peace are few.The election has become a referendum on Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s rule. While Israel\u2019s complicated electoral math gives him a good chance of remaining at the helm even if the Zionist Union wins more of Parliament\u2019s 120 seats than the Likud, the campaign has revealed a yearning for change across the spectrum.\u201cI promise: I will be a prime minister to everyone,\u201d said Mr. Herzog, 54. \u201cFor right and left, for settlers, Haredim, Druze, Arabs, Circassians; I will be prime minister for the center and for the periphery.\u201dLater, he announced that his partner in Zionist Union, Tzipi Livni, had agreed to drop their deal to rotate the premiership \u2014 a focus of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s case against them. Ms. Livni\u2019s lower popularity had made the deal an electoral liability and would also complicate coalition brokering.\u201cWe are united in our task to change the government,\u201d Mr. Herzog said on Israeli television Monday evening. \u201cThe choice tomorrow is between desperation and hope, and the hope of the greater good for this country is change of the government.\u201dBut the right-wing bloc still looked far larger than the center-left, making Mr. Herzog\u2019s path to the premiership difficult to plot. Seen more as consensus builder than commander in chief, he took voice lessons to address a persistent squeak and asked people not to use his nickname, Bougie. The gap between him and Mr. Netanyahu on whom Israelis saw as most suitable to lead them shrank but remained significant.Mr. Herzog and others argued that he was actually threatening Israel\u2019s security by angering the White House, and that all his strident speeches had not yielded results on improving the terms of the Iran negotiations.The economic platform was also seized by Yesh Atid, the centrist faction that had stunned Israel by winning 19 Parliament seats in the last election, 2013, and Kulanu, a new party led by a popular former minister who broke from the Likud and had few nice things to say about his former boss.\u201cWhat\u2019s striking is that the Israeli public seems to have lost interest with the Palestinian question \u2014 the general feeling is that it\u2019s like the weather, nothing you can do about it,\u201d observed Guy Ben-Porat, a political scientist at Ben Gurion University. \u201cEconomy, housing, all these issues where nobody\u2019s sure what the difference is, exactly, between the parties, there\u2019s a feeling of government failure. I think it\u2019s really a personal election, meaning anti-Netanyahu.\u201dScenes from the campaign trail earlier this year, as Israelis grappled with a rapidly evolving political landscape.Most analysts agreed that Tuesday was unlikely to produce a clear winner. Once the votes are counted, Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, will poll party heads to see whom they prefer as prime minister, a process that could take 10 days. Whoever Mr. Rivlin designates then has six weeks to try to create a coalition and form a government. Given the divisions, another possibility is a unity government, with the Zionist Union and Likud rotating the premiership \u2014 something both sides publicly oppose. Leaders of smaller parties said Monday night that Ms. Livni\u2019s withdrawing her rotation agreement suggested that secret negotiations for shared power between Mr. Herzog and Mr. Netanyahu were already underway.Tamar Hermann of the Israel Democracy Institute said the campaign has been \u201ca struggle over the identity of the nation,\u201d where she sees \u201coverlapping cleavages\u201d in income, education, religion and worldview.\u201cI\u2019m very much afraid of the morning after,\u201d Ms. Hermann said. \u201cI see no way of either a right-wing government or a left-wing government acquiring the necessary public legitimacy, grass-roots legitimacy, in order to design \u2014 and more than that, implement \u2014 grand strategies on social-economic issues or even security-diplomatic matters.\u201dVoters appear energized by the close contest, and the last polls, published on Friday, suggest a large chunk remain undecided. Sara Dahan, a Jerusalem mother of three, said Sunday that she would either vote for the new Likud-breakaway, Kulanu, or, \u201cif there is a chance my vote may influence helping making a change,\u201d the Zionist Union.\u201cI don\u2019t claim to know what is best for the country, but I do know what I see now and what I feel are the biggest problems,\u201d said Ms. Dahan, who never before voted for Labor. \u201cOn the one hand is the security situation, which I would love to have some kind of solution for. On the other hand,\u201d she added, \u201cit\u2019s the difficulties of a young couple, both working, having a difficult time buying an apartment, groceries, making it through the month.\u201dMr. Netanyahu\u2019s final push to win back voters from the right seemed to have worked on Adi Perkin, 24, who in 2013 backed the pro-settler Jewish Home, but said Sunday that \u201cprobably in the end I will vote for Bibi in order to strengthen him.\u201d\u201cThis election had a very bad side, which was that instead of talking to the citizens, the campaigns were about besmirching the others,\u201d Ms. Perkin said. \u201cAll the ads were \u2018just not Bibi,\u2019 \u2018just not Herzog.\u2019 Instead they should have explained to the voters what they plan and what they want.\u201dBut Ido Nitai, 21, a bar manager, voted for Mr. Netanyahu last time, and now is shopping for someone \u2014 anyone \u2014 else.\u201cIf I wanted to keep the country in the same situation it is in today then I would vote for Bibi,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I want to see a change here.\u201dAn earlier version of this article erroneously translated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s response to a question from NRG, an Israeli news site. Asked, \u201cIf you are prime minister, a Palestinian state will not be established?\u201d he responded, \u201cIndeed,\u201d not \u201cCorrect.\u201d (The Hebrew words for these are very similar.)Irit Pazner Garshowitz contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debunking the Myth of the Job-Stealing Immigrant", "Date": "2015-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyWhen I was growing up in the 1980s, I watched my grandfather \u2014 my dad\u2019s stepdad \u2014 struggle with his own prejudice. He was a blue-collar World War II veteran who loved his family above all things and was constantly afraid for them. He carried a gun and, like many men of his generation, saw threats in people he didn\u2019t understand: African-Americans, independent women, gays. By the time he died, 10 years ago, he had softened. He stopped using racist and homophobic slurs; he even hugged my gay cousin. But there was one view he wasn\u2019t going to change. He had no time for Hispanics, he told us, and he wasn\u2019t backing down. After all, this wasn\u2019t a matter of bigotry. It was plain economics. These immigrants were stealing jobs from \u201cAmericans.\u201dI\u2019ve been thinking about my grandfather lately, because there are signs that 2015 could bring about the beginning of a truce \u2014 or at least a reconfiguration \u2014 in the politics of immigration. Several of the potential Republican presidential candidates, most notably Jeb Bush, have expressed pro-immigration views. Even self-identified Tea Party Republicans respond three to two in favor of a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Every other group \u2014 Republicans in general, independents and especially Democrats \u2014 is largely pro-immigrant. According to Pew, roughly as many people (18 percent of Americans) believed in 2010 that President Obama was a Muslim as believe today that undocumented immigrants should be expelled from the United States. Of course, that 18 percent can make a lot of noise. But for everyone else, immigration seems to be going the way of same-sex marriage, marijuana and the mohawk \u2014 it\u2019s something that a handful of people freak out about but that the rest of us have long since come to accept.Scratch the surface, though, and you\u2019ll pretty quickly find that many Americans are closer to my grandfather\u2019s way of seeing things than they might find comfortable acknowledging. I am referring not to the racial animus but to the faulty economic logic. We generally support immigration when the immigrants are different from us. People in the middle and upper-middle classes don\u2019t mind poorly educated, low-skilled immigrants entering the country. Nor do we mind highly educated professionals coming in \u2014 unless, that is, we are in the same profession ourselves. More broadly, those of us advocating an immigration overhaul are basically calling for official recognition of the status quo, through offering legal status to some of the roughly 11.2 million undocumented workers who aren\u2019t going away. Few of us are calling for the thing that basic economic analysis shows would benefit nearly all of us: radically open borders.And yet the economic benefits of immigration may be the \u00admost \u00adsettled fact in economics. A recent University of Chicago poll of leading economists could not find a single one who rejected the proposition. (There is one notable economist who wasn\u2019t polled: George Borjas of Harvard, who believes that his fellow economists underestimate the cost of immigration for low-\u00adskilled natives. Borjas\u2019s work is often misused by anti-immigration activists, in much the same way a complicated climate-\u00adscience result is often invoked as \u201cproof\u201d that global warming is a myth.) Rationally speaking, we should take in far more immigrants than we currently do.So why don\u2019t we open up? The chief logical mistake we make is something called the Lump of Labor Fallacy: the erroneous notion that there is only so much work to be done and that no one can get a job without taking one from someone else. It\u2019s an understandable assumption. After all, with other types of market transactions, when the supply goes up, the price falls. If there were suddenly a whole lot more oranges, we\u2019d expect the price of oranges to fall or the number of oranges that went uneaten to surge.But immigrants aren\u2019t oranges. It might seem intuitive that when there is an increase in the supply of workers, the ones who were here already will make less money or lose their jobs. Immigrants don\u2019t just increase the supply of labor, though; they simultaneously increase demand for it, using the wages they earn to rent apartments, eat food, get haircuts, buy cellphones. That means there are more jobs building apartments, selling food, giving haircuts and dispatching the trucks that move those phones. Immigrants increase the size of the overall population, which means they increase the size of the economy. Logically, if immigrants were \u201cstealing\u201d jobs, so would every young person leaving school and entering the job market; countries should become poorer as they get larger. In reality, of course, the opposite happens.The single greatest bit of evidence disproving the Lump of Labor idea comes from research about the Mariel boatlift, a mass migration in 1980 that brought more than 125,000 Cubans to the United States. According to David Card, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, roughly 45,000 of them were of working age and moved to Miami; in four months, the city\u2019s labor supply increased by 7 percent. Card found that for people already working in Miami, this sudden influx had no measurable impact on wages or employment. His paper was the most important of a series of revolutionary studies that transformed how economists think about immigration. Before, standard economic models held that immigrants cause long-term benefits, but at the cost of short-term pain in the form of lower wages and greater unemployment for natives. But most economists now believe that Card\u2019s findings were correct: Immigrants bring long-term benefits at no measurable short-term cost. (Borjas, that lone dissenting voice, agrees about the long-term benefits, but he argues that other economists fail to see painful short-term costs, especially for the poor.)Economists have shifted to studying how nations so quickly adjust to new arrivals. The leading scholar on this today is Giovanni Peri of the University of California, Davis, who has shown that immigrants tend to complement \u2014 rather than compete against \u2014 the existing work force. Take a construction site: Typically, Peri has found, immigrants with limited education perform many support tasks (moving heavy things, pouring cement, sweeping, painting), while citizens with more education focus on skilled work like carpentry, plumbing and electrical installation, as well as customer relations. The skilled native is able to focus on the most valuable tasks, while the immigrants help bring the price down for the overall project (it costs a lot to pay a highly trained carpenter to sweep up a work site). Peri argues, with strong evidence, that there are more native-born skilled craftspeople working today, not fewer, because of all those undocumented construction workers. A similar dynamic is at play on Wall Street. Many technical-support tasks are dominated by recent immigrants, while sales, marketing, advising and trading, which require cultural and linguistic fluency, are typically the domain of the native-born. (Whether Wall Street\u2019s technical wizards have, on balance, helped or hurt the economy is a question for another day.)This paradox of immigration is bound up with the paradox of economic growth itself. Growth has acquired a bad reputation of late among some, especially on the left, who associate the term with environmental destruction and rising inequality. But growth through immigration is growth with remarkably little downside. Whenever an immigrant enters the United States, the world becomes a bit richer. For all our faults, the United States is still far better developed economically than most nations, certainly the ones that most of our immigrants have left. Our legal system and our financial and physical infrastructure are also far superior to most (as surprising as that might sometimes seem to us). So when people leave developing economies and set foot on American soil, they typically become more productive, in economic terms. They earn more money, achieve a higher standard of living and add more economic value to the world than they would have if they stayed home. If largely open borders were to replace our expensive and restrictive lottery system, it\u2019s likely that many of these immigrants would travel back and forth between the United States and their native countries, counteracting the potential brain drain by sharing knowledge and investment capital. Environmentally, immigration tends to be less damaging than other forms of growth, because it doesn\u2019t add to the number of people on earth and often shifts people to more environmentally friendly jurisdictions.Whenever I\u2019m tempted by the notion that humans are rational beings, carefully evaluating the world and acting in ways that maximize our happiness, I think of our meager immigration policies. For me, it\u2019s close to proof that we are, collectively, still jealous, nervous creatures, hoarding what we have, afraid of taking even the most promising risk, displaying loyalty to our own tribe while we stare, suspiciously, at everyone else. It\u2019s nice to believe that I am part of a more mature, rational generation, that my grandfather\u2019s old ways of thinking are dying away. But I\u2019m not so sure. We might be a lot more like him than we want to think.Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR\u2019s \u201cPlanet Money\u201d and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.N. Reveals \u2018Alarmingly High\u2019 Levels of Violence Against Women", "Date": "2015-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout 35 percent of women worldwide \u2014 more than one in three \u2014 said they had experienced physical violence in their lifetime, the report finds. One in 10 girls under the age of 18 was forced to have sex, it says.The subject is under sharp focus as delegates from around the world gather here starting on Monday to assess how well governments have done since they promised to ensure women\u2019s equality at a landmark conference in Beijing 20 years ago \u2014 and what to do next.Hillary Rodham Clinton, who attended the Beijing conference in 1995, is scheduled to speak on Tuesday.As many girls as boys are now enrolled in primary school, a sharp advance since 1995. Maternal mortality rates have fallen by half. And women are more likely to be in the labor force, though the pay gap is closing so slowly that it will take another 75 years before women and men are paid equally for equal work.The share of women serving in legislatures has nearly doubled, too, though women still account for only one in five legislators. All but 32 countries have adopted laws that guarantee gender equality in their constitutions.Little was even known 20 years ago about the extent of such violence, a measure of the lack of focus on the issue.\u201cAt the time of the Beijing conference there was a desperate call for more information,\u201d said Mary Ellsberg, director of the Global Women\u2019s Institute at George Washington University. Now, she said: \u201cWe have data from most of the countries in the world. That, in and of itself, is a huge accomplishment. The issue is, it\u2019s very hard to collect this data.\u201dWhere there are laws on the books \u2014 125 countries criminalize domestic violence today, up from 89 in 2006, according to Equality Now, which tracks laws that affect women\u2019s rights \u2014 they are not reliably enforced.In some cases, the laws on the books are the problem, women\u2019s rights advocates say. In some countries, like Nigeria, the law permits a man to beat his wife under certain circumstances. But even when laws are technically adequate, victims often do not feel comfortable going to law enforcement, or they are unable to pay the bribes required to file a police report.Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the executive director of the United Nations agency for gender equity and women\u2019s empowerment \u2014 known as UN Women \u2014 said that for the laws to mean anything, governments around the world have to persuade their police officers, judges and medical personnel to take violence against women seriously.\u201cI am disappointed, I have to be honest,\u201d she said about the stubborn hold of violence against women. \u201cMore than asking for more laws to be passed, I\u2019m asking for implementation.\u201dYasmeen Hassan, the executive director of Equality Now, said governments needed to be reminded that they committed to making their laws fair for women. Cultural differences cannot be an excuse, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a cop-out for governments to not do what they signed up to do,\u201d she said.The new round of global development targets that governments around the world will have to agree to later this year, known as Sustainable Development Goals, includes a separate requirement for women\u2019s equal rights, including how they protect their female citizens from violence.The latest United Nations report draws attention to the rise of \u201cextremism and conservatism,\u201d and without naming any countries or groups, it argues that what they share is a \u201cresistance to women\u2019s human rights.\u201d The assaults and abductions by the Islamic State have brought new urgency to the issue.Dr. Hudson, the academic, said the persistence of violence in so many forms is in part because it can establish domination against women of all kinds, for a broad range of personal and political purposes. A husband can just as easily beat his wife if she is a high school dropout or a college graduate. An entire territory can be claimed if fighters rape the local women \u2014 or take them as sex slaves, as is the case of the Islamic State.\u201cI think violence against women is so darn useful,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019ll be so hard to eradicate.\u201dViolence can start before birth. Sex-selective abortions have been reduced in some countries, as in South Korea, but are higher than ever in other places, like India, and are going up sharply in places like Armenia.Harassment is commonplace. In the United States, 83 percent of girls aged 12 to 16 said they had experienced some form of harassment in public schools. In New Delhi, a 2010 study found that two out of three women said they were harassed more than twice in the last year alone.\u201cViolence against women has epidemic proportions, and is present in every single country around the world,\u201d said Lydia Alpizar, executive director of the Association for Women\u2019s Rights in Development, a global feminist group. \u201cYet it is still not a real priority for most governments.\u201dPerhaps the biggest change in 20 years, say those who attended the Beijing conference, is that the subject is now front and center in public discussion.\u201cThere is actually a great deal more attention being paid today to violence against women,\u201d said Charlotte Bunch, a feminist scholar who attended the Beijing conference. \u201cThe truth is, it\u2019s a complex issue that isn\u2019t solved easily.\u201dAn article last Tuesday about a United Nations analysis that showed an \u201calarmingly high\u201d level of violence against women and girls worldwide understated the cost of domestic violence against women and children as calculated by a separate study. It is $8 trillion, not $4 trillion. (Violence against women alone costs $4 trillion, the study said).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece Says It\u2019ll Present E.U. With Planned Overhauls by Monday", "Date": "2015-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Greece will present a detailed list of proposed overhauls to its eurozone partners by Monday, a government spokesman said, as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras met supporters and leading government ministers on his first official visit to Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse, Germany.At 40, the always tieless Mr. Tsipras has cut an unusual figure among European leaders since being elected less than two months ago. After stopping his convoy en route to Angela Merkel\u2019s chancellery on Monday to greet friendly demonstrators, on Tuesday he visited the stark memorial in central Berlin to the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust.It is rare for visiting leaders to stop at the 2,711 blocks of stone that make up the memorial to Europe\u2019s murdered Jews.The visit to the memorial next to the Brandenburg Gate followed more than five hours of talks and dinner with Ms. Merkel on Monday. It also came after more meetings on Tuesday with the two leading Social Democrats in Ms. Merkel\u2019s coalition as well as with opposition leftists sympathetic to Mr. Tsipras and his pleas for a new approach to Greece\u2019s debt crisis.A Greek government spokesman, Gavriil Sakellaridis, told Mega TV that a list of overhauls would \u201cbe done by Monday at the latest.\u201dThere was no indication whether the list had been discussed in any detail with Ms. Merkel. Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said Monday\u2019s talks had taken place \u201cin a good and constructive atmosphere,\u201d covering Greece\u2019s situation, how the European Union works and bilateral cooperation.At an evening news conference barely an hour into the talks, both leaders urged their compatriots to abandon stereotypes about each other\u2019s countries. While guarded, they were clearly at pains to reduce the acrimony that has clouded the new Greek government\u2019s dealings with Germany and its other eurozone partners in recent weeks.One issue that has flared up is that of German reparations for the Nazi crimes committed during the occupation of Greece in World War II. Tens of thousands of Greeks were killed, and an estimated 80,000 Greek Jews were deported to concentration camps. The Nazis also exacted a forced loan from Greece that was not repaid in full.Mr. Tsipras raised the loan as a matter of what he called ethical and moral concern. But he emphasized that \u201ctoday\u2019s Germany has nothing to do with the Germany of the Third Reich, which cost so much bloodshed.\u201dThe visit to the memorial was sandwiched between talks with Germany\u2019s foreign and economy ministers, both Social Democratic leaders in Ms. Merkel\u2019s coalition government of center-right and center-left parties. Mr. Tsipras also met with two leaders of the Left Party, which has voiced strong support for the new Greek prime minister.Portrayed in popular German news media and by many conservative politicians as irresponsible or at best na\u00efve, Mr. Tsipras was hailed by the Left Party leader, Katja Kipping, as \u201chighly responsible.\u201d He deserves support for efforts to alleviate the suffering of hungry and homeless Greeks, she said on German television Tuesday morning.Niki Kitsantonis reported from Athens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kosovars Who Fought for Land Are Now Eager to Leave ", "Date": "2015-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA bus housing illegal immigrants who have been caught crossing the border from Serbia. An Afghan and two Kosovar Albanians who have left the bus to smoke are watched by the\u00a0 police.STANOVC, Kosovo \u2014 The extended Cakaj family has built a few dozen homes here, along Tony Blair Street, between the Dubai supermarket and the French peacekeepers base, in a clannish faith that closeness would bring security. But recently the family of Kosovo Albanians has begun to splinter, as a disastrous economy, static politics and a newly created opening in the border with Serbia have enticed tens of thousands of Kosovars to leave their troubled land in search of opportunity and work.\u201cMy son had no choice,\u201d said Xhevat Cakaj, but to leave their enclave for Germany with his wife and their five girls. They had only one cow, he said, whose milk they sold in a market in nearby Pristina, Kosovo\u2019s capital, and their only other source of income was running a minibus service until the local authorities clamped down.Squinting to survey the land where his family hid from the Serbs in the 1999 war, he wept at the irony of fate. \u201cNo one leaves for pleasure,\u201d said Mr. Cakaj, 64.Afrim Syla, 48, of Pristina, who makes pancakes for a living and recently had a son join the exodus, concurred: Once, Kosovars were laying down their lives to stay here. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have come to a situation where we leave of our own free will.\u201dSixteen years after NATO, in its only war, drove out Serbian security forces so 850,000 Kosovo Albanians expelled by the Serbs could return home, the flow of Kosovo Albanians has reversed. For months now, buses have been bringing Kosovo Albanians through Serbia to the porous land border with Hungary, in the European Union.The Albanians cross on foot, often undetected. When picked up by Hungarian officials, they have been detained only briefly. Many are enticed by the promises of a paid Serbian \u201cguide\u201d or have a friend or relative in Austria, Switzerland, Germany or Scandinavia and, moving freely among European Union nations, make their way toward them.But Kosovo\u2019s Albanians, most of whom are Muslims, are not being greeted with open arms. In another twist, they are being forced back to their land, deemed too physically \u2014 if not financially \u2014 secure to warrant asylum status.The turnaround says as much about Western Europe\u2019s struggle to handle its torrent of refugees and other immigrants seeking stability and opportunity, as it does about the isolation and deprivation of the people in the Balkans.At Pristina\u2019s grim bus station, the flow of buses leaving each night is down to two, from a reported 12. There, a large notice lists 10 reasons not to emigrate, first among them that the Kosovo state for which Albanians fought so hard needs people if it is to exist.But persuading people to remain and reintegrating those who are being forced to return remains a challenge.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very difficult spring,\u201d said Samuel Zbogar, a Slovenian diplomat who heads the European Union\u2019s mission here.No one seems to know exactly when and why the exodus started, but it has been startling in its swiftness and intensity. Officials in Austria and Germany sounded alarms in January, after registering huge increases in Kosovo Albanians seeking asylum.The immediate trigger was a fresh opportunity at the border. Kosovars \u2014 unlike impoverished Balkan neighbors in Albania, Macedonia and Bosnia \u2014 do not have access to European visa programs, contributing to their sense of abandonment and isolation, political leaders, officials and independent researchers say.European-brokered agreements last fall \u2014 part of continuing Western efforts to foster cooperation between Kosovo Albanians and Serbs \u2014 created more entry points for Kosovars to enter neighboring Serbia and freer passage across Serbia, as well as broader mutual recognition of identity documents. The buses started to roll northward.While Kosovars felt hope in the aftermath of their brutal war with the Serbs and their declaration of independence in 2008, many \u2014 particularly the young \u2014 say they now see few prospects.Many feel a stifling sense of uncertainty rooted, in part, in the territory\u2019s status. Russia, a longtime ally of Serbia, does not recognize it, and some nations see its independence as a signal to their own separatists: China, which is under pressure for a free Tibet and five of the 28 members of the European Union \u2014 most notably Spain, which worries about Catalonia.Domestically, Kosovo is reeling. Elections last June went unresolved for months, until the party of the former prime minister, Hashim Thaci, a hero of the war against Serbia lately accused by critics of being power hungry and corrupt, muscled its way into a governing coalition. Mr. Thaci is now foreign minister.Adding to this brew of troubles is the economy. In a region plagued by aging demographics, it is Europe\u2019s youngest territory, with 27 the average age of its two million citizens. Kosovo would need an impossible 7 percent annual economic growth to offer work to the 25,000 to 30,000 youths the government says finish school each year. Direct investment from foreign sources is about $270 million a year, half what it was in 2007, said Lumir Abdixhiku, executive director of Riinvest, an independent research group.Austria registered 1,901 asylum applications from Kosovo citizens in 2014, but saw 1,029 in January alone, said Karl-Heinz Grundb\u00f6ck of the Interior Ministry in Vienna. By mid-February, Germany had some 18,000 applications from Kosovars since Jan. 1.Within Kosovo, the Education Ministry counts some 5,600 absent pupils.But Western Europe is already swamped with refugees from war and turbulence in the Middle East and Africa, and is struggling to integrate Muslim immigrants. Accommodation is so scarce that some Kosovo arrivals were housed in old United States Army barracks in Heidelberg, Germany.In Germany, the flood from Kosovo has now slowed to about 200 arrivals a day, from 1,400 a day in early February.Prime Minister Isa Mustafa, 63, now faces the challenge of keeping Kosovo Albanians at home. A veteran of Kosovo politics, he said he hoped to ease youth discontent by spreading the city\u2019s sports and cultural facilities across Kosovo \u2014 a region that broils in summer, but still has no public swimming pool \u2014 and improving education.\u201cWe have to free people from this isolation,\u201d he said.Many here see the solution in a regulated flow of visas for Europe. Mr. Abdixhiku, the analyst, said providing 100,000 Kosovars opportunities in Europe could compensate for neglect. \u201cIt was not fair,\u201d he said, \u201cto leave Kosovo as a black hole for all these years,\u201d limiting even business travel.But European governments are troubled by rising populism and nationalism, along with voters\u2019 complaints about immigration from even European Union member states like Romania and Bulgaria. Germany expects 300,000 asylum applications this year after just over 200,000 in 2014. So visas are unlikely. Mr. Zbogar, the European Union diplomat, talked of an increase in European spending, to about $90 million this year, from $80 million. Germany and others are also promising more aid.Critics said corruption is rampant, undermining development. They point to new government highways recently built, linking Pristina with Albania and its coast, whose costs ballooned.Ardian Gjini, a leader of the opposition party Alliance for the Freedom of Kosovo, likened the highway project \u2014 and corruption in general \u2014 to giving one\u2019s son a 100 euro note (about $110) and asking him to buy two glasses of wine. The son proudly returns with the wine, but cannot say where the change went, Mr. Gjini said bitterly.For the Cakaj family, the problems have prompted some reinvention. Isa Cakaj, 42, showed a visitor around his neat food store and compound, including a two-story home, cow stall and apple orchard. He has a degree in geological engineering, but Kosovo\u2019s mineral mines are either drying up, or still untapped. So he is retraining in forensics, supporting his wife, father and five children as best he can.Opposite his home is the well-appointed but deserted compound of a cousin who works year-round in Germany and visits in summer \u2014 and is among those who send an estimated $650 million in remittances back to Kosovo each year.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have connections and know people, there is no way for you to get a job,\u201d said Isa Cakaj\u2019s father, Sherif. Officials, he said angrily, \u201cdon\u2019t care if you have a job or not; they just want you to pay the utility bills.\u201dIn his 75 years, he insisted, things had never been so bad. \u201cThe worst thing is when you are alive, but you are dead,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was not so old, I would leave myself.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swedish Prostitution Law Targets Buyers, but Some Say It Hurts Sellers", "Date": "2015-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGOTHENBURG, Sweden \u2014 Not far from the Sticky Fingers nightclub, three Romanian women were hunched against the cold on a street corner. When a man walked by, the women, in broken Swedish and English, tried to tempt him to buy sex.On this dismal street in Gothenburg, Sweden\u2019s second-largest city, the same scene plays out every Friday night. Until recently, Daniella, 34, who was brought to Sweden from Romania by a pimp 10 years ago, was a part of it.Now, Daniella, who asked that her full name not be used, has walked away from that life. After the pimp was sent to jail for four years, she turned to a volunteer group for help finding a way off the streets and became part of a broad decline in prostitution in Sweden.But as Sweden assesses the lessons of its approach, it continues to grapple with issues that could limit progress in reducing prostitution and sex trafficking, including the effects of technology on the market for sex and the rights of prostitutes themselves.The stigma against prostitutes remains widespread, the review also found, making it difficult for women to get help from social services and the police, and stoking their fear of eviction or loss of custody of their children.The law is forcing women who sell sex into more dangerous situations, it said, arguing that transactions have become faster and more furtive because men are afraid of the police, leading women to jump into cars without first checking if the driver is drunk, high or otherwise threatening. And the number of Swedes in favor of a ban on the sale of sex as well as its purchase appears to have grown.The Swedish Association for Sexuality Education \u2014 known by its Swedish initials, R.F.S.U. \u2014 said the results of the research review raised questions about the law\u2019s effectiveness, as well as its impact on prostitutes and on women like Daniella seeking to leave prostitution. The group said in February that it was \u201cfar from obvious that the legislation had had the intended effect.\u201dIt said the law had increased stigma and discrimination, putting women who sell sex \u201cin an even more precarious position,\u201d and should be changed to better protect their rights.Kristina Ljungros, the group\u2019s president, said she opposed legalizing the purchase of sex, as Germany and the Netherlands have done. Instead, she said, her group wants to open a discussion about what it considers the unintended consequences of Sweden\u2019s law.\u201cSome people selling sex report that it is very hard to find a social service that will help women unless they stop selling sex,\u201d Ms. Ljungros said. \u201cI think we need more of a harm reduction perspective that would protect people selling sex and their rights in a better way.\u201dSuch questions about the law\u2019s effectiveness have provoked a storm of indignation among its supporters, with some accusing the R.F.S.U. of siding with men who buy sex, closing its eyes to trafficking and violence against women, making prostitution respectable, and denying the victim status of the women who are forced into the trade. The report released Friday by the County Administrative Board of Stockholm found that while there had been a huge increase in online ads for escorts selling sex to men, one seller was often behind multiple ads. \u201cAgainst this background, there is nothing indicating that the actual number of individuals engaging in prostitution has increased,\u201d it said.When Patrik Cederlof, head of Sweden\u2019s National Coordination Office Against Prostitution and Trafficking, began working on these issues in the late 1990s, the situation was very different: Trafficking was not an issue, and the women selling sex were overwhelmingly Swedish. Now, he said, the women are mostly from the poorest European countries, like Romania and Bulgaria, along with some from Nigeria.More than eight in 10 want to go back to their home countries, Mr. Cederlof said, because it is hard for them to find other jobs and make a life in Sweden. \u201cIn the best of all possible worlds, we would have better exit programs, funding to offer education and work possibilities, and to increase cooperation with the countries of origin,\u201d he said.Sweden\u2019s stuttering economy and 8.4 percent unemployment rate make it harder for prostitutes to quit, said Anna Skarhed, Sweden\u2019s chancellor of justice, whose detailed review in 2010 presented evidence that the law had reduced prostitution and changed attitudes toward it.Thomas Ahlstrand, Gothenburg\u2019s deputy chief prosecutor, has spent more than a decade combating the trafficking of women into the city.Mr. Ahlstrand was originally against the ban on buying sex \u2014 the state should not meddle in the affairs of consenting adults, he reasoned. But he later changed his mind. \u201cI realized by meeting these girls and talking to them and reading about it, I was wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were victims of oppression.\u201dSweden\u2019s law is \u201ca stroke of genius,\u201d he said. \u201cThe beauty of the Swedish system is that we criminalize the strong, the oppressors.\u201dThe law gives prostitutes essential support, Mr. Ahlstrand said, and helps the police track down pimps and traffickers while stigmatizing men who buy sex.Daniella, the former prostitute, said her turning point came when the pimp who had brought her here was convicted and jailed. She continued working the streets at first, sending the money back to a prostitution ring in Bucharest, Romania, but eventually concluded that she needed to stop.\u201cI was fighting with myself inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid. It took me three years to trust the people who wanted to help me.\u201dThe government has an agency to help prostitutes, but \u201cthe girls don\u2019t trust it,\u201d said Jonna Bostrom, the founder of Rosenlundstodet. \u201cWe are sisters to the girls. We listen; we don\u2019t judge.\u201dMs. Bostrom spent months trying to win Daniella\u2019s trust and convince her that she could start a new life outside prostitution.\u201cI wanted it to be my decision, not being pushed by somebody else,\u201d Daniella said. \u201cI needed to be ready inside to take this decision.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saints\u2019 Owner Marches Out of Step With His Heirs\u2019 Expectations", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Tom Benson sat at the head of a wooden conference table unruffled in a dark business suit, with a crisp aqua necktie and a handkerchief tucked neatly in his breast pocket. One after another, the top executives who run his two teams \u2014 the N.F.L.\u2019s Saints and the N.B.A.\u2019s Pelicans \u2014 offered details about how their ad campaigns, ticket sales and digital signboards were doing.As he listened, Mr. Benson, 87, sipped Coke from a glass that his wife, Gayle, 68, who sat at his side, kept refreshed. He asked about budgets and timetables and playfully needled an underling. When he heard that the Saints\u2019 media guide was being prepared for the coming season, though, he issued a command.\u201cNow that Gayle is going to be more involved, I want her to have a separate page,\u201d he said.Everyone nodded.Mrs. Benson\u2019s future ownership of the Saints and the Pelicans is at the center of a compelling legal drama that has gripped a city that is no stranger to fevered melodrama. In January, Mr. Benson announced that when he died, the city\u2019s cherished Saints as well as the Pelicans would be passed on to his wife of 10 years \u2014 not to his daughter, Renee Benson, and her two children, Rita and Ryan LeBlanc, as had long been assumed.Suddenly, New Orleans\u2019s most prominent family became Topic A at cocktail parties and on sports radio. There is no shortage of theories: greed, jealousy and ineptitude. Or questions: Is Mr. Benson feeble or frail? Is Gayle Benson a gold digger or his protector? Are his daughter and grandchildren spoiled or spurned?\u201cAll the people who came before me that said money can\u2019t make you happy, this proves their point,\u201d said the political consultant James Carville, who worked with the Saints to bring the Super Bowl to New Orleans in 2013. \u201cThis has all the elements of a story that is going to last. It\u2019s not the question of whether it\u2019s going to be a book, but how many.\u201dIn the coming weeks, Mr. Benson, by court order, will be tested by a panel of three doctors, who will report their findings to a judge. If the doctors decide that Mr. Benson is incapable of taking care of himself, he could be in for a struggle to save an empire that he initiated almost 70 years ago while working at a local Chevrolet dealership. New Orleanians are watching \u2014 the Saints especially are considered a barometer of the city\u2019s self-esteem, and fans worry that a struggle for the team could hurt its fortunes on the field.\u201cI think now people want to know what is best long term for the Saints and New Orleans,\u201d said Deke Bellavia, a local sports radio talk show host. \u201cThere\u2019s been some mudslinging, but it could get real, real, real nasty.\u201dFight Gets PersonalIn New Orleans, however, the battle has gotten more personal because Renee, 59, Rita, 38, and Ryan, 35 (who refer to themselves as the Three R\u2019s), say that Mr. Benson is mentally unfit and is being manipulated by Mrs. Benson, his third wife.Renee Benson \u2014 a daughter from the first marriage \u2014 and Rita and Ryan LeBlanc declined to speak for this article. Ms. LeBlanc was the most involved with the Saints, as a vice chairwoman, but had an uneven record there. In 2012, Mr. Benson forced her to take a sabbatical from the team because of mistreatment of co-workers and her work ethic. But several people who had worked with Ms. LeBlanc came to her defense.\u201cBesides being an engaged partner, she was a cheerleader for the city,\u201d said Rod West, the chief administrative officer at Entergy Corporation, who worked with Ms. LeBlanc and other members of the Benson family on the host committee for Super Bowl XLVII. \u201cParticularly within the New Orleans region, Rita was the face of the Saints and Hornets to the business leaders who dealt with the committee.\u201dMs. LeBlanc has also been active in the movie industry, working with the Louisiana Film and Entertainment Association. She is credited with contributing to the growth of the New Orleans Film Festival.\u201cShe\u2019s very interested in it, been active on the board, very interested in growing the film economy here and a terrific advocate,\u201d said Susan Brennan, who owns Second Line Stages. \u201cShe does her homework and is prepared and asks good questions.\u201dIn court papers, Renee, Rita and Ryan have said they are close with the family patriarch and are victims of a \u201ccoup attempt\u201d that has banished them from the teams, auto dealerships and other businesses that, until recently, they had helped run and stood to inherit.Gayle Benson, who once ran a home-sales jewelry business and is twice married and divorced, has \u201cincreasingly isolated and alienated Mr. Benson from family, friends, business associates and employees,\u201d according to their complaint. To prove that Mr. Benson is unfit, Renee, Rita and Ryan have said that Mr. Benson believed that Ronald Reagan was still president and that Mr. Benson subsists on a diet of candy, ice cream, soda and red wine. They are seeking to remove him as the trustee of a trust he established for them because he withdrew $24 million from a bank owned by the trust. Mr. Benson said he was angry that his daughter had gone behind his back and sought his personal financial information. In late December, he sent her and her children a letter stating that he never wanted to see them again, something the three say could have been written only under duress.\u201cSuddenly after I remarried you all became offensive and did not act in an appropriate manner and even had arguments among yourselves which created a very unpleasant family situation which I will not stand for,\u201d Mr. Benson wrote.In court papers, Mr. Benson said that his decision to give the teams to his wife, and not his daughter and her children, was not a result of a pique of anger, but of years of disappointment. He tried to groom them to take over the teams and his other businesses, but \u201cunfortunately, the petitioners never rose to the task.\u201dIn late December and January, the Saints fired Ms. LeBlanc, and her company car was taken away. Mr. Benson revoked Ms. LeBlanc\u2019s lease in his office tower because she failed to pay the rent. The N.F.L. removed her from various owners\u2019 committees.Still, Mr. Benson\u2019s complaint said Renee and her two children \u201cwill continue to enjoy hundreds of millions of dollars they have been given; they simply will not have the specific assets they would like to have.\u201dA Couple Rarely ApartThe critical legal issue in the Benson case is simply: Is Mr. Benson capable of taking care of himself and his property?In several meetings last month at the teams\u2019 headquarters in a New Orleans suburb, Mr. Benson talked at length about his work, joked amiably with colleagues and guests and recalled friends and events from years ago.Seven operations on his knee last year have taken their toll. He walked slowly with a cane and occasionally had to fish for a date or a name. But Mr. Benson said that he continued to work five days a week because it kept him sharp mentally and physically.\u201cSome people like to play golf; I like to come to work,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody makes me come here. It\u2019s what I like to do.\u201dMr. Benson conceded that his daughter and grandchildren\u2019s lawsuit was a shock but insisted that he had moved on.\u201cWas I surprised? I think so, because when your family attacks you, it\u2019s kind of hard to take, hard to understand,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first, I couldn\u2019t believe it, you know. But I finally accepted it, and hopefully it will work out all right. The only bad thing is, you just go your way and leave us alone, you know?\u201dMrs. Benson, who sat next to her husband at meetings and works in a small office nearby, said the couple were apart only three days a year, when Mr. Benson attends an all-male religious retreat.\u201cI\u2019m with him 24 hours a day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a very close relationship. He tells and talks to me a lot about what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s been a big help to me.\u201dMrs. Benson acknowledged that she knew little about football when they met a decade ago, not long after Mr. Benson\u2019s second wife died from complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease. But over time, she has developed relationships with N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell and David Stern, the former N.B.A. commissioner, as well as other owners and their wives.\u201cIn the beginning, I was a little shy about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI would sit back a little bit.\u201dMrs. Benson said that her husband made all the business decisions but that she was very familiar with the inner workings of the teams. Mr. Benson does not have a cellphone, for example, so Saints and Pelicans executives who need to reach him when he is out of the office often call or email Mrs. Benson to relay their messages.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a phone; he doesn\u2019t want to deal with it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would rather me tell him about it.\u201dMr. Benson, sitting nearby, nodded and then smiled. \u201cBut one thing about it, she doesn\u2019t ever try to overrule me.\u201dRemaking a TeamMr. Benson built a network of about 30 auto dealerships (most have since been sold), opened a bank and has accumulated a portfolio of real estate, including the Benson Tower next to the Superdome.He has significant business holdings in San Antonio, but he is rooted to New Orleans, where he and his three brothers grew up. In 1985, when John Mecom Jr., the owner of the Saints, indicated that he might move the team from New Orleans, Mr. Benson and a group of investors bought the team for $64 million.After 20 consecutive nonwinning seasons, the Benson-owned Saints went 12-3 in 1987 and qualified for the playoffs for the first time. They made the postseason three times in the early 1990s before slumping toward the end of the decade.After Hurricane Katrina forced the Saints to decamp for San Antonio in 2005, Mr. Benson explored staying in Texas and even fired Arnie Fielkow, one of the Saints\u2019 executive vice presidents, who publicly favored returning to New Orleans. But the N.F.L. commissioner at the time, Paul Tagliabue, urged Mr. Benson to return the team to Louisiana.The return recast Mr. Benson as a savior and raised Rita\u2019s profile. After cutting a favorable deal with the state to continue playing at the Superdome, Mr. Benson bought and refurbished a dilapidated office tower near the stadium. He also bought a local television station and an Arena Football League franchise. In 2012, he took control of the struggling Hornets and changed their name to the Pelicans.When the Saints won their first Super Bowl, in February 2010, Coach Sean Payton and quarterback Drew Brees were the on-field heroes. But Mr. Benson was regarded as the Saint of New Orleans behind them.Struggle on ParadeBy outward appearances, at least, Mr. Benson remains engaged. Kevin Avin, the headmaster at the Stuart Hall School for Boys, said that in September Mr. Benson talked to some of his students for 30 minutes about growing up in New Orleans, his education and his career in business.\u201cThe guy was sharp,\u201d Mr. Avin said. \u201cIt takes a good bit to hold the attention of a 7- or 9-year-old boy. He had a wit about him that was humorous.\u201dDawn Benson Jones, whose father, Robert, was Mr. Benson\u2019s only son, said she spoke to her grandfather twice a week and visited him in New Orleans around Christmas. She decided to speak out in her grandfather\u2019s defense when she saw that his legal trouble was \u201cnot going away and was ratcheting up.\u201d\u201cI have every confidence that he\u2019ll pass the test with flying colors, and once that\u2019s established, other things will be put to rest,\u201d she said.Until then, the Bensons will remain an object of fascination in the city. Days after the lawsuits were filed, the Krewe of Muses, a social organization that puts on one of the largest Mardi Gras parades, captured the spirit of the family struggle.On one of its floats, the group mocked the Saints\u2019 up-and-down season. They asked whether Brees was a hero or overpaid and whether the team was playoff-caliber or cringe-worthy. On the front, they added a wheel with the words \u201cRita\u201d and \u201cGayle\u201d in different quadrants and a bottle that spun like a dial.\u201cIt started out as, \u2018Who Dat going to show up on the field this Sunday,\u2019 and it turned into \u2018Who Dat owner,\u2019 \u201d said Virginia Saussy, a longtime Saints fan who helped create the float. \u201cThe whole float worked with what was going on with the team.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article described incorrectly two of the people battling Tom Benson in court over ownership of the Saints and the Pelicans. As the article correctly noted, besides Rita LeBlanc, Benson\u2019s granddaughter, they are her mother and brother, not her two children.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a film studio owned by Susan Brennan. It is Second Line Stages, not Second Line Studios.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The House Budget Disaster", "Date": "2015-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe plan\u2019s deep cuts land squarely on the people who most need help: the poor and the working class. The plan also would turn Medicare into a system of unspecified subsidies to buy private insurance by the time Americans who are now 56 years old become eligible. And it would strip 16.4 million people of health insurance by repealing the Affordable Care Act (the umpteenth attempt by Republicans to do so since the law was enacted in 2010). House Republicans would increase defense financing by bolstering a contingency fund that is not subject to existing budget caps, while insisting on adherence to caps or even deeper cuts to nondefense spending on education, the environment, law enforcement, medical research and other so-called discretionary programs. At the same time, the plan proposes deep cuts to \u201cmandatory\u201d nondefense spending, which includes Medicaid, federal pensions, food stamps, farm supports and tax credits for the working poor. The details of these cuts are vague, but the Medicaid cuts alone would inevitably fall on millions of children in low-income families and millions of older people (mostly women) in nursing homes, groups that are the program\u2019s main beneficiaries. Republicans say the cuts are necessary to reduce the deficit and balance the budget, but annual budget deficits have fallen steeply during the Obama years. Going forward, there is both a need and an opportunity for the government to spend in ways that create jobs and lay a foundation for future growth, say, by investing in education, science and infrastructure. And even if cutting the budget were urgent \u2014 which it is not \u2014 the House Republican plan ignores the most sensible, equitable cuts. For example, it doesn\u2019t propose to reduce the deficit by closing tax loopholes that drain the budget of more than $1 trillion a year and that overwhelmingly benefit the highest-income households, including special low tax rates on investment income. The absence of tax increases in the presence of deep spending cuts is a recipe for increasing both poverty and inequality. But the budget plan blithely predicts that its policy proposals will bolster economic growth and increase tax revenues by some $140 billion over the next 10 years, leading to budget surpluses. House Republicans are sticking to their tired themes of spending cuts, no matter the need or consequences, and tax cuts above all. Senate Republicans, whose budget resolution is scheduled to be unveiled Wednesday, are not expected to challenge the House approach in any major way. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Icy Stillness and Muted Fishing in a New England Port", "Date": "2015-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW BEDFORD, Mass. \u2014 Mark Abraham, who has fished the New England coast for decades, kept a sharp eye on his catch as the slimy haddock spilled onto a dockside conveyor belt. He had just returned from 10 frigid days at sea, among the most brutal he has spent.\u201cIt\u2019s probably been the worst winter in 10 years,\u201d he said as workers sorted the fish by weight and slid them into bins. \u201cIt\u2019s not even the ice that\u2019s stopping you, it\u2019s the wind. It\u2019s too rough to fish. If it\u2019s rough like that, you don\u2019t catch anything.\u201dA glance at the historic harbor, the epicenter of the whaling industry in the 19th century, when New Bedford was the richest city per capita in the world, also tells the story.For the first time in more than a decade, the Coast Guard in February issued \u201csevere ice\u201d bulletins for southeastern New England. \u201cThe severe frigid weather we have experienced for the past two weeks or so is expected to continue for at least another five days,\u201d read one bulletin, issued Wednesday.The Army Corps of Engineers has banned vessels shorter than 65 feet from Cape Cod Canal. The Coast Guard has no mandatory restrictions in place, but warns that buoys and other navigational aids have been submerged or blown off their stations and rendered useless. It recommends daylight passage only and one-way traffic.Mr. LeBlanc helps assign the Coast Guard cutters that break up the ice, though the latest bulletin warned that the ice was so thick in spots that it could not be broken.From Jan. 1 through last Monday, Mr. Canastra said, the haul from all of his fishermen was 45 percent lower than in the same period last year. He attributed the decline to the weather as much as to federal quotas.\u201cIn a way, the quotas are worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe storms are only two months of the year, while the quotas are 12.\u201dThe harbor is not the only victim of the harsh winter. New Bedford is enduring record snowfalls and bitter temperatures; on Feb. 21, they plunged to 12 below zero. Like Boston, the city has had to truck snow out of its compact downtown to outlying snow farms. One of them, along the harbor here, is so vast that Jonathan F. Mitchell, the mayor of New Bedford, calls it a mountain range.Mr. Mitchell said he had set aside $350,000 for snow removal but had already spent twice that, with little to show for it since nothing has melted.\u201cIt\u2019s a big pain in the butt,\u201d he said. He had to close City Hall for several days, which also meant shutting down the schools and libraries, which in turn ground many businesses to a halt.Over the last several years, New Bedford has done much to pull itself out of the economic doldrums that have stymied so many other old Northeast industrial towns. But one growing concern here is that the harsh winter may nip that progress because it knocked out the transit system in Boston. That could mean little political will \u2014 and no spare money \u2014 to build a long-promised commuter rail line between New Bedford and Boston, 60 miles away.Mr. Mitchell said that while he wanted the rail service, it was not central to the city\u2019s economic development strategy, which he said depended more on growth at the port and on building out the campus of the nearby University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.The mayor has another plan in the works, saying that New Bedford could bolster Boston\u2019s bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics by staging the sailing races in nearby Buzzards Bay. Those races are tentatively planned for Boston Harbor, but, Mr. Mitchell said, \u201cNew Bedford may well be the best place in America to host Olympic sailing.\u201dIf the ice ever melts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia to Join Regional Development Bank Led by China", "Date": "2015-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Australia plans to join an Asian infrastructure bank led by China, the government announced on Sunday, reversing an earlier decision taken at the urging of the United States not to become a member. The move made Australia the latest of a list of major American allies to sign up.The office of Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in a statement that Australia still had concerns about the management of the bank but recognized the pressing needs for infrastructure in Asia. The decision will allow Australia to \u201cparticipate as a prospective founding member in negotiations to set up the bank,\u201d the statement said.Australia said it wanted to ensure that the board of directors had authority over crucial investment decisions and that \u201cno one country,\u201d a reference to China, controls the bank.Among Washington\u2019s main objections to the China-led bank have been concerns that it would seek to undermine the authority of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, established after World War II with the United States in the leadership role.The administration has also suggested that, given China\u2019s record on the environment and lack of transparency, the new bank would not meet the standards of existing institutions. The Chinese have countered that bureaucracy at the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which is based in Manila and led by Japan, has slowed their capacity to meet demand.Australia\u2019s move leaves the major Asia Pacific allies, the United States and Japan, China\u2019s biggest competitor in Asia, outside the bank. While some in Washington have said the United States should consider joining, that is an unlikely prospect.After expressing doubts, the Obama administration would be unlikely to reverse course, and Congress would almost certainly oppose the United States\u2019 participating in an institution founded and primarily run by China.The turnaround by Australia showed that the United States\u2019 \u201cfriends and allies are quite willing to accommodate China\u2019s growing power despite America\u2019s objections,\u201d said Hugh White, a professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University.\u201cAustralia of course worries about China\u2019s growing power, but it is also eager to be part of Asia\u2019s economic and political future and simply cannot afford to become isolated from the new Asia China is building,\u201d Mr. White said.Washington eased its opposition slightly as members of the G-20 group of advanced economies joined the bank, saying last week that it would encourage the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to cooperate with the new institution.A chief justification for the new bank is the failure of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to keep up with the huge needs for roads, railways and power in large areas of fast-developing Asia.In a speech at the annual Boao Forum for Asia in southern China on Saturday, President Xi Jinping of China said the new bank would supplement the work of the World Bank and other international financial institutions.\u201cBeing a big country means shouldering greater responsibilities for the region, as opposed to seeking greater monopoly over regional and world affairs,\u201d Mr. Xi told the forum.Nearly 40 countries have said they would join the new bank. The Chinese set a deadline for the end of March for founding members to join. The bank will be led by a Chinese official in Beijing and have a starting capital of between $50 billion and $100 billion, Chinese officials say. It is expected to start operations at the end of the year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of England Warns of Risks From Greece and Market Liquidity", "Date": "2015-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The Bank of England said Thursday that Britain\u2019s stability continued to be threatened by international risks, including Greece\u2019s financing needs, China\u2019s slowdown and potentially inadequate market liquidity.The committee, which was set up to monitor systemic risks in the financial system, said that credit growth in Britain remained moderate and that the country\u2019s banks were increasingly more resilient. Risks around the housing market have abated, though household indebtedness remains high, the report said.But it flagged international risks, specifically in Europe where signs of recovery have not placated fears of persistently low growth. China\u2019s slowdown and the standoff in Greece over its debts could pose dangerous trigger points, the report said. The Prudential Regulation Authority, which is part of the Bank of England, is factoring in these risks in developing a framework for its 2015 stress test, which is due out on Monday.The committee also raised concerns about market liquidity, noting that investors were buying and pricing some securities based on the idea that selling them again would be fairly easy, even though \u201cliquidity in some markets may have become more fragile.\u201dTrading volumes in fixed-income markets have fallen relative to market size. A sudden, brief plunge in the 10-year Treasury yield in October raised concerns over whether a lack of liquidity was exacerbating volatility.The group has asked the country\u2019s regulators to gather information from British asset managers on how they would manage their liquidity in the event of stress event.Concerns have been raised that although banks have reduced their inventory of bonds, an increasing number of individuals have invested in vehicles like exchange-traded-funds, which often can be redeemed daily. If the banks are not willing to step in and buy in a volatile environment and investors rush to sell, the effect could be dire, some have warned.More information from the asset managers \u201cwould inform assessment of the extent to which markets are reliant on investment funds offering redemptions at short notice,\u201d it said.The group specifically addressed concerns about risks in the commercial real estate and leveraged loan market. London commercial property values have soared in the last two years. But the committee concluded that yields were not unusually low and debt financing had not increased enough to warrant concern. Additionally, British banks have a smaller piece of the debt financing pie.The group said underwriting standards in the leveraged loan market had fallen as measured by loan-to-value and interest coverage ratios, but not yet to the point of warranting a policy response.\u201cWere that trend to continue, U.K. banks could quickly become less resilient to stress in these markets,\u201d it concluded, adding that it would monitor the situation.Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, said in a letter to the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, that over the next year, the group would review how banks\u2019 capital buffers were calibrated and carry out its annual assessment of financial stability risks and regulation \u201cbeyond the core banking system\u201d later in 2015.Mr. Carney, who is also chairman of Financial Stability Board, said after a meeting of the board in Frankfurt on Thursday that its members had raised concerns about liquidity.\u201cMembers noted current concerns about rising risks stemming from the overestimation by investors of the degree of liquidity fixed-income markets as well as the growth of assets under management in funds that offer on-demand redemptions but invest in less liquid assets,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janet Yellen Isn\u2019t Going to Raise Interest Rates Until She\u2019s Good and Ready", "Date": "2015-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyWith this framing, Ms. Yellen was putting her firm stamp on the policy of an institution she has led for just over a year \u2014 and making clear that she will not be boxed in. Her words and accompanying announcements conveyed the message that the Yellen Fed has no intention of taking the support struts of low interest rates away until she is absolutely confident that economic growth will hold up without them.Ms. Yellen\u2019s comments about patience versus impatience were part of that dance. But the dual message was even more powerful when combined with other elements of the central bank\u2019s newly released information, which sent the signal that members of the committee intend to move cautiously on rate increases.By eliminating the reference to \u201cpatience,\u201d Paul Edelstein, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said in a research note, \u201cThe Fed did what it was expected to do.\u201d\u201cBut beyond that,\u201d he added, \u201cthe committee appeared much more dovish and in not much of a hurry to actually pull the trigger.\u201dFed officials\u2019 forecasts of how high rates will be at year\u2019s end for 2015, 2016 and 2017 all fell compared to where they were in December. They marked down their forecast for economic growth and inflation for all three years, implying that the nation\u2019s economic challenge is tougher and inflation risks more distant than they had seemed a few months ago.In other words, they want to run the economy a little hot for the next couple of years to help spur the kinds of wage gains that might return inflation to the 2 percent level they aim for, but which they have persistently undershot in recent years.Apart from the details of the dovish monetary policy signals Ms. Yellen and her colleagues sent, it is clear she wanted to jolt markets out of any feeling that policy is on a preordained path.The current flatness of the curve shows investors expect mediocre growth.Since then, the job market has shown strong improvement, particularly in terms of jobs added and the falling unemployment rate. But meaningful wage gains are still lacking. Meanwhile, oil prices have plummeted and the dollar has risen on global markets, both of which are pushing inflation far below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target (leaders of the central bank expect inflation of 0.6 to 0.8 percent in 2015).There are likely to be plenty of twists and turns in the coming months. After this week\u2019s meeting, Ms. Yellen reinforced the message she has been trying to convey that the committee really will adapt its policy to incoming information rather than simply carry on with the path it set a year ago.If the strengthening dollar and falling oil prices start to translate into still-lower expectations for future inflation, the Fed will hold off from rate rises \u2014 and the same if wage gains and other job market indicators show a lack of progress.Conversely, if the job market recovery keeps going gangbusters and it becomes clear that inflation is going to rise back toward 2 percent, Ms. Yellen does not want to be constrained by language about \u201cpatience.\u201d\u201cThis change does not necessarily mean that an increase will occur in June,\u201d Ms. Yellen said, \u201cthough we cannot rule that out.\u201dShe has now bought herself some latitude to decide when and how the Fed ushers in an era of tighter money. Now the question is just how patient or impatient American economic conditions will allow her to be.Advertisement"}

When she appeared in Paris newly platinum blonde, it broke the front row (and all the rows after). What was on the runway hasn\u2019t yet been quite enough to sustain conversation.Going back to his beginnings (on Friday a show dedicated to Jeanne Lanvin was opening at the Palais Galliera, and he had retrospectives on the mind), i.e., his childhood in Morocco, he mixed riding trousers, striped up the side, big tassels flying out at the waist, with squared-off cropped jackets and flat knee-high leather boots, the tassels reappearing on the belts of wrap-around coats or re-imagined as the fringe of a traditional tribal wedding rug on a skirt.Flowing dresses were shielded over one shoulder by a leather harness that snaked down and around the waist; chunky Mongolian lamb coats and vests covered glittering peasant-print dresses and jumpsuits; and there were rough Berber stripes under glossy ponyskin. In the end, it all came together in velvet: glossy, distressed, rose-embellished, rich. Many of these elements have walked Mr. Elbaz\u2019s runway before, but this felt less like a rerun of greatest hits than a learning from history. The roots may have been nomadic, but the contemporary equivalent is globe-trotting executive.Drive down the streets of Paris and Angela Merkel\u2019s face stares out from myriad billboards on the cover of French Vanity Fair. Open a newspaper, and there is Hillary Clinton, presumed Democratic frontrunner for president of the United States, or Christine Lagarde, managing director of the I.M.F., discussing the European economy.

Mr. Elbaz went some way toward rectifying the situation. Instead of armor, he offered the security of lavish functionality.The answer, at least in his hands: surprising beauty, whether in the shape of a quilted backwards puffa, the front jutting out like the stern of a ship, or a jacket embellished by the Mayan-inspired architecture of a symbolic backbone. Twists and turns came fur-fringed or glinting with a river of gold sequins, like the royal robes of a space invader whose ship crashed in the desert long ago. Now she was up, and ready to rule.There\u2019s lots of talk these days about girls and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), the lack of the former in the latter, and Mr. Anderson is doing his part to close the gap.Begin with a strong female image, and who knows where you will end up?Instead of flowers, Mr. Simons gave us abandoned landscapes of knit jacquard dresses, long and short; Canadian fox mini-frocks and feral coats pieced together like the earth as seen from above; and earthquake-aftermath bodysuits under sliced apron pinafores. Someone had got their claws in.Maybe a bit too much in the case of the latter looks, but the point was made. Patent leather was cross-hatched into futuristic stretch pencil skirts and sleeveless tunic tops; men\u2019s wear tweeds cut into cropped boy pants and matching jackets or oversize Crombie coats; crisp white shirtdresses paired with car-wash tweed skirts, cut to show what lay beneath.

{"Headline": "Job Growth for Hispanics Is Outpacing Other Groups", "Date": "2015-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEmployment among Hispanics has increased 5 percent over the last 12 months, according to the Labor Department, compared with 3.8 percent for blacks and 1.4 percent for whites. (The last figure partly reflects the rising number of retirements among the aging white population.)But, on closer inspection, the trends driving the improving job market for Hispanics are trends most skeptics of immigration would cheer.The first is a rebound in the construction industry, which is good news for the American economy as a whole, because construction jobs pay above-average wages to low-skill workers.More broadly, the surge in Hispanic employment reflects an increasingly robust recovery. Economists generally say that the job prospects of lower-skill workers are more sensitive to the economy\u2019s tidal movements than those with better skills, and Hispanics, as a group, tend to be less educated than blacks and whites.The second reason behind lower Hispanic unemployment is a sharp decline in illegal immigration in recent years, which has reduced the number of workers who might otherwise have turned up in government unemployment statistics.At the recent peak in the mid-2000s, federal agents were apprehending just over one million undocumented migrants a year along the southern border. That number fell by roughly half during the recession, then dribbled to 340,000 in 2011. The collapse in apprehensions of immigrants from Mexico, by far the largest source of undocumented labor, was even sharper.The reason for the drop was twofold, said Madeline Zavodny, an economist at Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga. First, economic conditions in Mexico were improving even as growth in the United States remained sluggish, reducing a crucial incentive to emigrate.On top of that was a development that should warm the hearts of Tea Party supporters: enforcement. Thanks to the rapid militarization of the border \u2014 the number of border patrol agents has increased by two-thirds since 2006 \u2014 crossing into the United States is now a far more daunting proposition than before the recession.\u201cIt\u2019s more costly in terms of what you have to pay a coyote, how remote you have to go,\u201d Ms. Zavodny said.\u201cWhen a company makes it clear they\u2019re using E-Verify, the whole work force knows,\u201d said Pia Orrenius, an economist who studies immigration at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. \u201cThat news spreads like you would not believe.\u201dTaken together, the story of the last 10 years looks something like the following: A construction boom from 2004 to 2007 led to a corresponding boom in Hispanic employment, with immigrants gaining 1.6 million jobs and native-born Hispanics gaining 800,000, according to Pew. Unemployment then spiked for both groups during the recession, and contributed to a drop in illegal immigration. And because immigration has never really recovered, the recent rebound in construction is primarily benefiting American-born workers.Sooner or later, of course, the recovery will begin attracting more workers from Latin America, notwithstanding the beefed-up enforcement. Although illegal immigration is still far below its peak, it has begun to tick up again. Excluding unaccompanied minors, apprehensions at the southern border are up 25 percent since they bottomed out in 2011.Showdowns between Congress and the president may be zero-sum, in which one side wins only at the other\u2019s expense. But immigration, it turns out, is not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dispute Between Poroshenko and Billionaire Governor Threaten Ukraine Alliance", "Date": "2015-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 A dispute between President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine and the billionaire governor of one of the country\u2019s regions over control of two state-owned energy companies widened Monday, confronting the new Ukrainian government with its most serious internal crisis since coming to power last year.Until the dispute burst into the open last week, the governor, Igor V. Kolomoisky, had been among the Kiev government\u2019s staunchest allies. Militias financed privately by him have played a crucial role in stopping pro-Russian separatists waging war in the east from advancing into the heart of Ukraine.That alliance, however, appeared to be in jeopardy as Mr. Poroshenko and Mr. Kolomoisky clashed in recent days over the future of the two companies, UkrTransNafta and Ukrnafta, and as the president announced that he would take steps to incorporate militias like those controlled by Mr. Kolomoisky into Ukraine\u2019s regular military.The enmity comes as Mr. Poroshenko remains under tremendous pressure to demonstrate stability in spite of the continuing war and a collapsing economy that is being bailed out with tens of billions of dollars in international financing.As the animosity rose on Monday, Mr. Poroshenko ordered the Ukrainian state security service to arrest armed men, believed to be loyal to Mr. Kolomoisky, who have occupied the offices of UkrTransNafta and its parent company, Ukrnafta, in Kiev, the capital, since late last week.Some prominent lawmakers called for Mr. Kolomoisky to be dismissed from his post as governor of Dnipropetrovsk, while at least four members of Parliament announced that they were quitting Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s party, apparently out of loyalty to Mr. Kolomoisky.At the heart of the dispute is a law passed by the Ukrainian Parliament last week that reduced Mr. Kolomoisky\u2019s power as a minority shareholder in the companies and permitted a management change that he had previously blocked.Late Thursday night, masked men with guns swept into the offices of UkrTransNafta, apparently in support of the dismissed chief executive, Oleksandr Lazorko, an ally of Mr. Kolomoisky, who has refused to leave.How Russia aims to achieve its goal of keeping Ukraine isolated from the West.The government says there was no attempted sabotage.Mr. Kolomoisky\u2019s ability as a minority shareholder to control management decisions is an example of the murky dealings between the government and the country\u2019s richest business titans that have hobbled the Ukrainian economy for years.More alarmingly, however, the dispute has emphasized the potential threat that private militias pose to the fragile new government.Highlighting that risk, Mr. Kolomoisky in his remarks to reporters noted that on his command, 2,000 armed men could be brought to Kiev within hours. Still, the commander of Mr. Kolomoisky\u2019s main paramilitary group, Dnepro-1, denied any involvement.By Monday, no armed men were visible outside, though the group loyal to Mr. Kolomoisky apparently still occupied the building. Valentin Nalivaichenko, the director of the security service, told reporters on Monday that his agency would help the police arrest the men occupying the building.\u201cWe confirm that the police and journalists have noticed illegal actions by people with weapons\u201d in the capital, Mr. Nalivaichenko said. \u201cWe have a strict order from the president that every person in UkrNafta be disarmed.\u201d In another sign of mounting tensions, Mr. Nalivaichenko said his agency had also questioned two subordinates of Mr. Kolomoisky in the Dnipropetrovsk governor\u2019s office, about their possible roles in the murder of one Ukrainian security agent and in the kidnapping of another.In a statement posted on his website Monday in response to the standoff, Mr. Poroshenko said the volunteer battalions should be \u201cvertically integrated\u201d into Ukraine\u2019s regular army, which the government has been struggling to rebuild.Mr. Kolomoisky, widely known as a pugilistic character even as he is admired for his patriotism, has shown no signs of backing down. In an interview on the 1+1 television station, which he owns, Mr. Kolomoisky said he had spoken to Mr. Poroshenko and they had agreed \u201cthat this is not the way this should happen.\u201dCritics of Mr. Kolomoisky, however, said his actions showed his first allegiance was to his own wealth. Mustafa Nayem, a young member of Parliament from Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s party, urged the president and Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk to oust Mr. Kolomoisky. \u201cIgor Kolomoisky has no right to wear the title of a public servant,\u201d Mr. Nayem wrote in a blog post. \u201cAnd the president and prime minister have all the levers to correct the error.\u201d Daniel Rzhenetskyy contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From The Upshot\u2019s Editor: Political Mysteries", "Date": "2015-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet after you take into account of all these factors, there remains an element of mystery about presidential elections. The simplest way to summarize this mystery is to say that campaigns matter. And if campaigns matter, even those of us who are skeptical of gaffes \u2013 who are right to tune out the cable-television obsession with them \u2013 should be wary of dismissing them.Think about Al Gore in 2000. Someone could make a legitimate attempt to explain his loss without talking about the campaign itself. The economy was slowing sharply by late 2000, and he won the popular vote anyway. But the better reading of 2000 election, to my mind, also factors in Mr. Bush\u2019s apparent lead in likability, fair or not, over Mr. Gore.

{"Headline": "The Juvenile Habits of Israel\u2019s Voters", "Date": "2015-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTel Aviv \u2014 Israeli voters need to grow up \u2014 and preferably by Tuesday morning.The chances of this happening aren\u2019t great, and thus the chances of the March 17 election being a meaningful event are also slim. Israel might get a new prime minister, and it will certainly get a new coalition. But any coalition will have to constantly cater to the interests of the small parties it depends on. Israel\u2019s political system is in trouble. But the problem is not \u201cthe system\u201d \u2014 as people tend to often complain \u2014 it is the juvenile habits of Israel\u2019s voters.The real story of Israel\u2019s election is not about our ability to pick the right policy \u2014 it is about our ability to pick any policy. If voters don\u2019t make a clear choice between two camps, we\u2019ll all face another term of political instability, and be saddled with a government that can\u2019t truly set an agenda.According to polls, late last week 20 percent of voters were still undecided. Many of those, we call them \u201cfloaters,\u201d are just confused: they don\u2019t quite understand what the parties have to offer, and that\u2019s because many parties don\u2019t offer a clear agenda.Some floaters are angry with a political system that can\u2019t solve Israel\u2019s big problems. They have a point: Israel\u2019s recent governments were unable to make peace with the Palestinians, they didn\u2019t stop Iran\u2019s nuclear program, they couldn\u2019t eliminate Hamas and Hezbollah and they failed to reduce the cost of housing.But many of these floaters are just spoiled: they want a party that perfectly fits with their views on every single issue \u2014 no matter how arcane. That\u2019s how Israel ends up having so many midsize parties, instead of giving a clear mandate to one or two large ones.In the 1981 elections, the two main parties combined for 95 seats in a parliament of 120. Tomorrow they are expected to share less than 50. According to the polls, nine other parties will each get four to 13 seats each. This means that to have a coalition one of the two main parties would have to accommodate the special desires of four or five other parties to get to a majority of 61.I\u2019m a centrist, but my fellow centrists are clearly part of the problem. Since centrists tend not to embark on great ideological crusades, they shop for parties the same way they shop for clothing. They want a party that is fashionable and attractive and so they vote for celebrities rather than a political program. Instead of parties with an agenda, Israelis get empty shells whose sole agenda is to gain power. The whole political debate is dumbed down as a consequence.The success of parties like Kulanu and Yesh Atid, or Tzipi Livni\u2019s Hatnua two years ago, is a result of this trend. Kulanu is a vehicle for Moshe Kahlon, a popular former Likud politician who wants to be finance minister. Yesh Atid was born to give a platform to the well-known TV anchor, Yair Lapid, and allow him to get in the game. Hatnua was a way for Ms. Livni to stay in the game.Three months ago, Ms. Livni happily abandoned her platform to join forces with Labor. And why wouldn\u2019t she? Her views hardly differed from the agenda of Labor and Likud. They all vow to lower the cost of living, they say they\u2019d negotiate for peace while keeping Israel\u2019s strength \u2014 the equivalent of Miss Universe opposing hunger and advocating world peace.Then there are Israel\u2019s Russian voters. The big wave of immigration from the former Soviet Union happened more than 20 years ago, yet some of the more than one million Russian-Israelis still vote for a \u201cRussian\u201d party, Israel Beiteinu, the party of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman. But they don\u2019t need to. These immigrants are now Israelis. What they need is what most of us also need. And it\u2019s not Mr. Lieberman.It is unrealistic to expect all Israelis to vote for two big parties. Highly ideological voters and Arabs and ultraOrthodox Jews are going to vote for parties that speak specifically for them. But they can also do a better job.There is a new, unified, Arab Israeli party that will become one of the largest parties in the Knesset, giving Israel\u2019s significant minority the voice it deserves to have. Alas, the party doesn\u2019t seem to want to use this voice constructively, preferring to denounce the country\u2019s policies rather than take part in changing its realities. It is time for Israel\u2019s Arab voters to demand representation that truly reflects their interests, rather than politicians who simply denounce Israel\u2019s Zionist ethos rather than serve their constituents\u2019 political needs.Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox voters would also benefit from changing their outlook: When Israel was dominated by a secular, often condescending, Labor Party establishment, the decision by religious voters to vote for their special needs was understandable. But this was a long time ago; today, Israel\u2019s religious voters are no longer an insignificant or weak minority. It\u2019s time for them to demonstrate responsibility for Israel\u2019s society as a whole, and stop demanding special treatment that harms Israel\u2019s economy.And all the rest of us need to mature and go back to good old habit of voting for a real party.When I was young, I tended to handpick parties whose agendas and leaders seemed to perfectly suit my occasional mood. I voted for fashionable parties that appeared and then disappeared, and even for parties that did not make it into the Knesset. Tomorrow I am going to vote for a larger party that is not even close to being perfect. That\u2019s the price of growing up.Shmuel Rosner is the political editor at The Jewish Journal and a senior fellow at The Jewish People Policy Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "McConnell Urges States to Help Thwart Obama\u2019s \u2018War on Coal\u2019", "Date": "2015-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe campaign of Mr. McConnell, the Senate majority leader, is aimed at stopping a set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations requiring states to reduce carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, the nation\u2019s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions.Once enacted, the rules could shutter hundreds of coal-fired plants in what Mr. Obama has promoted as a transformation of the nation\u2019s energy economy away from fossil fuels and toward sources like wind and solar power. Mr. McConnell, whose home state is one of the nation\u2019s largest coal producers, has vowed to fight the rules.Since Mr. McConnell is limited in how he can use his role in the Senate to block regulations, he has taken the unusual step of reaching out to governors with a legal blueprint for them to follow to stop the rules in their states. Mr. McConnell\u2019s Senate staff, led by his longtime senior energy adviser, Neil Chatterjee, is coordinating with lawyers and lobbying firms to try to ensure that the state plans are tangled up in legal delays.On Thursday, Mr. McConnell sent a detailed letter to every governor in the United States laying out a carefully researched legal argument as to why states should not comply with Mr. Obama\u2019s regulations. In the letter, Mr. McConnell wrote that the president was \u201callowing the E.P.A. to wrest control of a state\u2019s energy policy.\u201dTo make his case, Mr. McConnell is also relying on a network of powerful allies with national influence and roots in Kentucky or the coal industry. Within that network is Laurence H. Tribe, a highly regarded scholar of constitutional law at Harvard Law School and a former mentor of Mr. Obama\u2019s. Mr. Tribe caught Mr. McConnell\u2019s attention last winter when he was retained to write a legal brief for Peabody Energy, the nation\u2019s largest coal producer, in a lawsuit against the climate rules.Peabody Energy has been the fourth-largest contributor to Mr. McConnell\u2019s election campaigns over the course of his political career, and his office maintains close and frequent communication with the company.In addition to stopping state-level enactment of the climate rules, Mr. McConnell\u2019s strategy is intended to undercut Mr. Obama\u2019s position internationally as he tries to negotiate a global climate change treaty to be signed in Paris in December. The idea is to create uncertainty in the minds of other world leaders as to whether the United States can follow through on its pledges to cut emissions.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen modern lobbying strategies that become a very large campaign, coordinated with states and localities, but we\u2019ve never seen a Senate majority leader or House speaker in front of it,\u201d said James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clever. It\u2019s sophisticated and unusual.\u201dAs he campaigned across Kentucky\u2019s economically ravaged coal towns last fall, Mr. McConnell frequently declared that he would do everything in his power to battle what he calls Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cwar on coal.\u201dUsing its existing authority, the E.P.A. will require each state to submit an individual plan for cutting emissions from power plants. Ultimately, the success or failure of the plan will depend on how \u2014 and if \u2014 states comply with the rules. It will also depend on the courts. Coal-dependent states and coal mining companies are already planning legal challenges to the regulations.Those coal-dependent states are where Mr. McConnell has trained his fire.Mr. McConnell contends that the Obama administration has bypassed Congress and stretched the boundaries of existing law to impose climate change regulations \u2014 and that he intends to step outside of Congress and use creative legal methods to push back. \u201cThe E.P.A. is bypassing Congress and the American people by unilaterally proposing these crippling regulations that would wreak havoc on our economy and are clearly unprecedented,\u201d he said. \u201cI have used and will continue to use all of the tools available to protect families and jobs, whether that be in Congress, or outside of the legislative process.\u201dAdvocates of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change agenda called Mr. McConnell\u2019s actions nearly unprecedented, and a spokesman for the White House assailed Mr. McConnell\u2019s moves.\u201cClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges that we face, and instead of offering solutions, Senator McConnell\u2019s alternative is an inappropriate and unfounded attempt to dictate state decisions,\u201d said Frank Benenati, the spokesman. \u201cE.P.A. is following the law by proposing clean-air standards to tackle the largest sources of carbon pollution \u2014 the power sector,\u201d he said. While some governors oppose the climate change plan, others are preparing to comply. On Thursday, the National Governors Association announced that four states \u2014 Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Utah \u2014 would take part in a program to prepare to meet the climate-change regulations. But longtime experts in the field of climate change law and policy say that Mr. McConnell\u2019s unconventional efforts could prove formidable.\u201cThe majority leader is a master tactician,\u201d said Scott Segal, a lobbyist with the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani and the director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, which represents power companies. \u201cHe understands the legal vulnerabilities, and he\u2019s acutely aware that not all solutions go through traditional legislative channels.\u201dOver the coming weeks and months, Mr. McConnell\u2019s office intends to continue to push to undermine the climate regulations, using a host of legal, lobbying and legislative tools.Less than a week after Mr. McConnell\u2019s op-ed article citing Mr. Tribe, Mr. McConnell\u2019s friend and fellow Republican, Representative Ed Whitfield of Kentucky, was the chairman of a House hearing designed to highlight the legal challenges to the climate change law. Mr. Whitfield called as his star witness Mr. Tribe \u2014 who in testimony likened Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change rules to \u201cburning the Constitution.\u201dIn April, Mr. Tribe, representing Peabody Energy, is set to deliver oral arguments in the first federal court case about Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change rules.Mr. McConnell\u2019s efforts come on top of an initial groundswell of efforts by Republican governors from coal-dependent states to push back at the rules. Twelve states have already filed suit against the rules.In Washington, a coalition of nearly 200 industry and lobbying groups, led by the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, has been working together for months on a set of legal and legislative tactics, both in Washington and the states, to block the rules.Advertisement"}

An exceptional 1959 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz can fetch as much as $250,000. The sketches that inspired these magnificent sculptures command far less money and attention.\u201cAmerican Dreaming\u201d was organized by Robert Edwards, a Detroit-area collector and documentary filmmaker who had started noticing midcentury design sketches at local garage and estate sales. When he discovered that a number of retired designers lived in his suburb, Royal Oak, his interest grew.\u201cThese were artists who impacted American culture in a huge way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut their stories were not being told.\u201dIn 1950 General Motors had $900 million in net income, a feat that Life magazine described as the \u201cmost profitable year of any corporation any time.\u201d That postwar period was heady for Detroit: Incomes were rising; people were moving to the suburbs; and the car, Life said, had emerged as the \u201cmost important cachet of social/economic position.\u201dIt was widely understood that what drove sales was what G.M. called \u201ceye appeal.\u201d Hundreds of artists were working in the automaker\u2019s styling section by that point, and every other car manufacturer had styling departments, too.Because aesthetics were considered the key to sales, these studios were insular realms. Doors were kept locked, and artwork was not allowed to leave the building. When a project was finished, or a design was no longer considered potentially useful, the sketches were destroyed. While the car manufacturers retained some drawings, most of what survives today was smuggled out of the studios by the stylists themselves. Mr. Edwards estimates that around 10,000 sketches still exist from professional stylists working in the golden age. The sketches reflect an America in which foreign competition was virtually nonexistent, and fuel economy was not yet an issue, yet it\u2019s not as if the stylists were working without constraints. Customers had high expectations for roominess and visibility. Engineering concerns established limits for wheelbases and road clearance. Cost was always an issue.\u201cEvery designer has a story where they fought for a particular aspect of design that they weren\u2019t able to get through,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cThe bean counters would step in and say, \u2018This is going to be too expensive.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe collaborative process also meant you could work for years on end and only rarely see your visions come to fruition. Along the way, there would be compromises and disagreements. Yet if stylists were somewhat akin to Hollywood screenwriters, unsung and often unable to deliver their dreams to the market intact, what is most apparent in their work is not the compromises, but their spirit of invention, love of speed and power and belief that a car can transform as well as transport.These sketches weren\u2019t necessarily supposed to be practical or even technologically feasible; they were meant to stir passionate responses. The goal was to inspire the development of a product so compelling that it would prompt hundreds of thousands of people to say: \u201cThis car speaks to me on some deeply personal level. This car embodies some primal part of my soul so fully I will gladly spend half of what I earn a year to own it!\u201dThat was no easy task, yet Detroit\u2019s stylists did it again and again.

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDesign NotebookScott McGlasson, of the one-man furniture studio Woodsport, characterizes his unfussy, clean style as \u201crustic modern.\u201d It\u2019s furniture he wants to make and furniture he can sell. But a dining chair for $1,600? Should that be considered an extravagance, or a pretty good deal?ST. PAUL \u2014 What is the value of a dining-room chair? You can\u2019t eat it. And you can sit on the floor free, as millions (billions?) of people do.A chair \u2014 any chair \u2014 is a luxury. But then what would be the right term to describe the real worth of a dining chair that sells for $1,600? An extravagance? An obscenity? How about a pretty good deal?The furniture maker Scott McGlasson, 48, professed a couple of goals last week when he set out to design a new chair in his shop, called Woodsport.He wanted a prototype that he could display in his booth at the Architectural Digest Home Design Show, which runs March 19 to 22 at Piers 92 and 94 in Manhattan. And he wanted to create a piece that could match his easy chair ($3,200) and chaise longue ($8,900). He calls this furniture line \u201cRB,\u201d for the running bond of two-inch-wide wood tiles that cover the seats like brickwork.At the moment, the black walnut tiles were all Mr. McGlasson had \u2014 that and a pencil sketch on a piece of quarter-inch hardboard. Last Monday found him laying out his high-tech design kit: a free pencil from Youngblood Lumber, a 4-foot-long straight edge, a Starrett square, a bevel, a punched metal disc and a Pink Pearl eraser.The eraser was getting the heaviest use. He hadn\u2019t liked the hardboard template when he first drew it four months ago. And it hadn\u2019t improved through desuetude.Ideally, when the chair was completed, it would be well proportioned, impeccably finished and sustainably sourced. It would express Mr. McGlasson\u2019s personal vision as a craftsman.Practically, the piece needed to be something he could build with about $200 to $300 worth of materials.And while the test model could take 40 hours to assemble, he would budget just half that time for the production version. (The chaise longue, by comparison, consumed 120 hours.)Mr. McGlasson also obeyed an overarching imperative: The chair needed to make a profit, and a decent one at that.\u201cI get hassled on price sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people will say, \u2018Really, isn\u2019t that a little much?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018What do you make?\u2019 I\u2019m sure my hourly rate is a lot lower than theirs.\u201dMr. McGlasson estimates that his hourly rate is $85. But Woodsport is a one-man studio (at least until he hires a new assistant).This means that he spends hours of every workday answering sales inquiries, shipping finished work and posting promotional images on Instagram. In a sense, his hourly rate for this work is zero. \u201cThe only time I\u2019m actually making money is when I\u2019m standing at the lathe,\u201d Mr. McGlasson said.That lathe, by the way, cost $4,000.This is the perverse economy of furniture making. A completed set of six chairs could run $10,800. The federal poverty guideline for a one-person household is only $1,000 more.\u201cThat kind of money is kind of insane,\u201d Mr. McGlasson said. \u201cPeople say that to me all the time: \u2018I love your stuff. I wish I could afford it.\u2019 And I say, \u2018I wish I could, too.\u2019 \u201dAt these prices, it\u2019s hard to believe that a high-end woodworker would cut corners. But, in a literal sense, cutting corners on a bandsaw is the definition of the job.The question is what kind of corners a designer chooses to cut. Should the legs be straight or tapered? Should the wood tiles be beveled or flat? Should the back slats be solid or laminated, straight or bowed?The chair he was imagining would be 36 inches tall, with a ladder-back up the spine. How many rungs should there be? \u201cTwo or three,\u201d Mr. McGlasson said.Each of these choices determines the labor that he needs to put into executing a piece. The easy chair had masculine arms, but the dining room version would go armless. \u201cArms? It\u2019s a pain,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a price in mind for this chair. The bigger the pain, the more time it takes me. And the more I need to charge for it.\u201dHe added: \u201cI also think it might look more elegant and clean without it.\u201dMr. McGlasson sometimes characterizes his style, with its unfussy geometry and clean appearance, as \u201crustic modern.\u201d It\u2019s furniture he wants to make and furniture he can sell. And these two priorities are not necessarily in competition.For example, he likes to use logs that he collects with a local sawyer, a weathered maverick named Vince Von Vett \u2014 \u201cTriple V\u201d for short.These are blowdowns from the lake country suburbs. It\u2019s environmentally sustainable, which makes a good story for the Woodsport website. And the harvesting gets him outside during the summer, which is where he wants to be.These are also the cheapest boards you can find. At the lumberyard, select-and-better-grade walnut costs $6 to $8 a board-foot. Triple V mills the trees for a quarter of that price. (Mr. McGlasson\u2019s own backbreaking labor is free.)The tiles for the new dining chair came from field trips with the sawyer. And the fetching curls and burls in the grain looked like prisms under bright light.Another way to put this thought is that if your aesthetic doesn\u2019t jibe with your pricing, you\u2019re not a furniture maker. You\u2019re a contractor, spending half your workweek installing kitchen cabinets and constructing office tables off someone else\u2019s blueprints. Or you\u2019re a hobbyist.Mr. McGlasson practiced both of those occupations. And before that he, too, was a hobbyist. These were honorable pursuits.\u201cI\u2019ve had bad jobs,\u201d Mr. McGlasson said. \u201cI scraped the sides and painted houses in the summer heat. I drove an ice cream truck that made no money. I ran the in-school suspension room in a junior high.\u201dAt that time, in his 20s, he was training to be a teacher. A perk of the job: free classes in the district\u2019s adult vo-tech program. \u201cI had no idea how a door was made,\u201d he said.His tastes were simple from the start. \u201cI liked Donald Judd,\u201d he said, referring to the conceptual artist known for his boxes. \u201cWhen your skills aren\u2019t that great, it\u2019s easy to look at Donald Judd and say, I can do that.\u201dHe built a bedroom set for himself and his wife, and then a crib. \u201cI was sort of burning out on working with kids,\u201d he said. \u201cI was having kids of my own.\u201dThen he met a Minneapolis architect who began giving him jobs in custom millwork and fabrication. He assembled reception desks (ramparts for corporate headquarters) and built-ins for condo conversions.Mr. McGlasson didn\u2019t quit this trade so much as the trade quit him. \u201cWhen the economy went in the tank, it really made me stop doing things the way I was working, building whatever came along,\u201d he said.For $25 a week, he set up a table at the Mill City Farmers Market, above the Mississippi riverfront. And he started hawking his original bowls, benches and cutting boards.Today, some of these early designs fill a showroom in his new wood shop. This is a five-room suite in a hulking old can-spraying factory, which he splits with four other woodworkers. A shopmate flies a remote-control plane under the blast-safe windows that cross the 28-foot ceiling. Mr. McGlasson bikes to the bathroom across the factory floor.For 5,300 square feet, the wood shop pays $2,000 a month, on a 10-year lease. Mr. McGlasson\u2019s share works out to $600 a month.An industrial shelving unit on the north wall holds his templates and forms. The key to profitable furniture is replication. He has learned to turn down commissions for one-offs. \u201cIf someone called me up and said, \u2018Can you make a bathroom vanity?\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201dThis standard would guide the model chair, too. On Tuesday, he redrew the jig (or template), raising the seat by three-quarters of an inch and chopping the top by almost two inches. Coming off the bandsaw, it looked like a lowercase letter h, in Helvetica backslant bold.\u201cYesterday, I might have been mired in a little self-doubt,\u201d Mr. McGlasson said. \u201cAnd today I thought, that\u2019s the chair. Why is there always this effort to change it, to make it something it\u2019s not?\u201dThe back slats would come from walnut he\u2019d milled down to 1/16th-inch veneers. The concept was to laminate them with a very slight curve. He glued these sheets together and clamped them to a solid wood form. Next, he placed the form in a 5-by-5-foot vacuum-sealer: a sous-vide bag for a side of elephant steak. The device cost $1,000.\u201cThis is a ton of work for a stupid little detail,\u201d Mr. McGlasson said. \u201cThe piece of wood that comes out of this is a lot stronger than if it was solid wood. So it can be thinner. It\u2019s a detail I like.\u201dMr. McGlasson had selected the walnut boards he would be using for the frame. He began to trace the template in three parts: a back leg and post; a seat rail; and a front leg. The plan was to cut them out, join them, then tape the rough outline to the jig and rout the edges.A router is a violent machine, Mr. McGlasson said. And it makes a mess. The wood shavings will go in a two-cubic-yard Dumpster, with a haulage cost of $100 a month.If the chair were to enter his furniture line, Mr. McGlasson could farm out these parts to a CNC shop, a computer-controlled router that makes quick, cheap, identical cuts. But then Mr. McGlasson held strong preferences about how the figure of the wood should lie. And he wanted to avoid the imperfections.You can\u2019t pay a computer to care about knots.Mr. McGlasson relies on other mechanical shortcuts without apology. \u201cMachines are golden and they\u2019re expensive,\u201d he said. He swears by his timesaver: a belt sander he bought for $4,500.And the lathe, he added, \u201ctook me from a dude in a shop making whatever came along to a designer who was producing original work that people sought out to purchase.\u201d This machine is where he turns his popular tables and lamps, whose voluptuous bases suggest the bust mannequins at Lane Bryant.An earlier generation of woodworkers was almost religious about hand tools. In the movement called Studio Craft, an artisan expressed an individual credo through consummate skill and strenuous human effort. You could see it in the hand-planing, the subtle gouges and rips.\u201cWhen I was a self-employed furniture maker, I made every mortise and tenon by hand,\u201d Mr. Korn said. \u201cBecause I enjoyed it, and it was about integrity. And I starved.\u201dMr. McGlasson runs across plenty of Studio Craft furniture at American Craft Council shows, where he sometimes rents a booth. He can appreciate the technical proficiency that goes into melding six types of wood into a single table. He calls it \u201cextreme woodworking\u201d or \u201cwoodworking for woodworkers.\u201dBut woodworkers are not his clientele. To reach his niche, he is paying $5,800 for perhaps 100 square feet of floor space at the Architectural Digest expo. Kiki Dennis, who runs Kiki Dennis Interiors, in Brooklyn, sourced a Woodsport credenza for a Park Slope client who attended last year\u2019s show.\u201cHer style was sort of minimal, and she loves beautiful wood and an organic sensibility,\u201d Ms. Dennis said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s definitely evident in his pieces.\u201dThe credenza is one of Mr. McGlasson\u2019s best-sellers: a four-panel rectangular box on a stark steel or bronze frame. The corner door-pulls follow the natural wane, or curve, of the tree. The credenzas cost $4,000 to $7,000.\u201cFurniture is expensive,\u201d Ms. Dennis said. \u201cEven not-especially-well-made furniture or not-solid-wood furniture.\u201d Mr. McGlasson\u2019s minimalist designs and unfussy workmanship could match a new dining room set a decade from now, she added.Finishing credenza doors with a timesaver, in other words, leads to the appearance of timelessness.On Friday morning, the riddle still plagued him: two slats or three? \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I\u2019ll get hung up on,\u201d Mr. McGlasson said. \u201cIt seems so simple, but that\u2019s the tricky stuff.\u201dThe chair was standing on the concrete floor, clamped and dry-fitted. He had trimmed the seat rail and lowered the back leg, lending the chair a bit of a louche slouch. \u201cNow I like the proportions of it,\u201d he said.This posture tilted the sitter toward the slats, though. The two-rung version recalled an ex-husband after an amicable divorce: He may appear supportive, but he doesn\u2019t actually have your back.Mr. McGlasson clamped on a third rung, sat down, and then stood up again and took in the profile. He had his verdict: \u201cTwo is better than three. It looks a little more mod. You put the third on there, and it looks like it\u2019s built for comfort.\u201dAs beer o\u2019clock rolled around, it was time \u2014 past time \u2014 to finalize the chair. \u201cI\u2019ll make a spec piece every once in a while,\u201d he said (that is, a design with no committed buyer). \u201cI\u2019ll knock a week off my schedule. But it\u2019s sort of stolen time, and I\u2019ll start getting really antsy. I\u2019ve got to get back to making money.\u201dMr. McGlasson finally punched insertion holes with the Domino and chiseled the seat back slats. Glue, sandpaper, rope, oil. By noon on Saturday, the chair was done.Correction: by noon on Saturday, the chair was finished, but still not done. The design was fine from the leg down. But to Mr. McGlasson\u2019s eye, the top felt homey, the equivalent of a Rockette wearing a sweater-vest.By necessity, he had moved on to turning four tables and four lamps. But he wanted a do-over with the chair. \u201cIf I had a little more time, I\u2019d make another one right now,\u201d he said. The seat-stays, he realized, should be shaped slabs of walnut, as thick as the back rail.A week ago, he\u2019d woken up in a fit of anxiety about piloting his Ford F-150 through the Lincoln Tunnel on the way to the home show. \u201cThis is not part of the furniture maker\u2019s skill set,\u201d he said. He was thinking of leaving the RB dining chair back home in St. Paul. If someone in New York tried to order it, what would he say?Designing a sublime piece of wood furniture was an achievement. But at the end of 40 hours, Mr. McGlasson had managed something even rarer. At $85 an hour for labor and $250 in materials, he\u2019d lost $3,650 on a $1,600 chair.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Industrial Zone Shifts East in Europe", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeBRUSSELS \u2014 Once depicted as a \u201cblue banana\u201d stretching from Manchester to Milan, Europe\u2019s industrial heartland has moved eastward just as its political center of gravity has shifted to Germany.The term was coined in 1989 \u2014 the year the Berlin Wall fell \u2014 to describe the French geographer Roger Brunet\u2019s work identifying a manufacturing megacity, visible from space at night as a band of light curving from England to Italy via the Netherlands, Belgium, West Germany and Switzerland.Mr. Brunet was worried that France, a highly centralized economy dominated by Paris, was fading from the map. He developed the concept to urge the government to invest in infrastructure to connect the Paris-Lyon-Marseille axis to the highly urbanized European backbone of around 110 million people.A quarter of a century later, the Continent\u2019s industrial geography has morphed. A more fitting image might be a golden football centered on southern Germany and reaching into Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria and Romania.\u201cWe seen a huge relocation and concentration into a central European manufacturing core,\u201d says Michael A. Landesmann, scientific director of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies.The former communist countries that joined the European Union in 2004 and 2007 have become the extended production line of German industry, no longer just supplying raw material and components but assembling cars and some industrial machinery.Manufacturing employment has declined everywhere in Europe as a share of the work force but most sharply in Britain, France and Belgium. The trend, driven by the globalization of supply chains, was accelerated by the post-2008 economic crisis.The shift in the balance of trade inside the European Union in the decade since the beginning of its eastward enlargement offers a striking illustration.The golden football region \u2014 Germany, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania \u2014 increased its share of trade within the European Union by 5.3 percentage points from 2004 through2013, the latest year for which final data has been published. The biggest gains accrued to Germany: 2.2 percentage points.Over the same period, the Atlantic Arc region encompassing Britain, France, Ireland, Spain and Portugal lost a cumulative 4.4 percentage points in its share of intra-European Union trade, led downward by Spain and Britain. Italy also lost 1.7 percentage points.How much this all matters is open to debate. To some extent, industrial jobs have been replaced by the growth of business services, especially in Britain, which has passed France as the European Union\u2019s second-biggest economic power, after Germany.Manufacturing jobs in advanced economies have become increasingly highly skilled, while those parts of production for which high skill levels are not needed have been shifted to regions with lower labor costs.In the knowledge economy, location may become increasingly irrelevant and industrial plants may wither in Europe, as coal mines and steel mills largely did in the late 20th century. Yet Germany has built on its economic dominance of Europe by maintaining the largest manufacturing base.More worryingly, Mr. Landesmann says, the southern periphery has become largely disconnected, industrially, from the core since the eurozone debt crisis forced Greece, Spain and Portugal to seek bailouts. \u201cThe periphery and lower-income regions are not linked to cross-border production networks. That is not easily reversible, and it\u2019s not just an exchange rate issue,\u201d Mr. Landesmann said.Economists assume too blithely that such trends will balance themselves out over time, Mr. Landesmann said, arguing that the loss of manufacturing capacity on Europe\u2019s southern fringes calls for policy action to build up the export capacity of peripheral countries.Not everyone is quite so gloomy.The latest figures from Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistics office, show exports from Spain, Portugal and Ireland rising again. Ireland was the fastest-growing economy in the eurozone last year, with 4.8 percent growth. Spain grew 2 percent, finally starting to turn the tide of mass unemployment.The Ford Motor Company and General Motors have just made major investments to increase car production in Spain. Because of big gains in productivity, Spain has increased its share of Europe\u2019s industrial gross value-added even as it has lost manufacturing jobs.These shifting patterns pose conundrums for European Union policy makers and the European Investment Bank as they consider how to target a planned strategic investment fund of 315 billion euros, or $330.5 billion, intended to attract private capital to long-term infrastructure projects.Should the priority be to counter the growing north-south economic divide, reindustrialize the rust belt and the olive oil belt, focus on reducing dependence on fossil fuels like imported Russian natural gas, or promote research and development in the industrial heartland?While acknowledging that trying to reverse the tide of industrial concentration would be futile, Vincent Aussilloux and Arno Amabile of the French government\u2019s policy planning agency, France Strat\u00e9gie, argue in a forthcoming paper that the European Union needs to target strategic investment at the most depressed regions.They also advocate a specific fund for the eurozone to provide loans and subsidies to develop research, small business and vocational training in the poorest peripheral areas.\u201cThis is also a political imperative so that Europe is once again identified with positive, future-oriented projects and not just with enforcing budget austerity,\u201d they say, warning that the widening industrial gap could otherwise cause a political explosion.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Foreign Policy Bridges Republican Divisions ", "Date": "2015-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCongressional MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Republicans, struggling in their first months of controlling Congress, have struck upon one unifying force: challenging President Obama on Iran and other aspects of his foreign policy.Republican lawmakers have defended their invitation to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to address Congress as well as a Senate letter to leaders of Iran despite criticism that they were undermining Mr. Obama and essentially operating a rogue State Department from Capitol Hill.The renewed emphasis on foreign policy has done more than provide Republicans with a rallying point \u2014 it has also given them a respite from internal divisions that were exposed in an unsuccessful effort to block the president\u2019s immigration actions and the embarrassing collapse of border security and abortion legislation in the House.It is a notable shift for a party that has concentrated in recent years on sparring with Democrats on domestic issues such as health care, federal spending and how to spur wage growth and job creation. With the economy improving, those lines of attack have lost significant punch and Republicans are embracing foreign policy to contrast themselves with the president and his Democratic allies.\u201cUniformly, we believe that this administration has been very weak on foreign affairs,\u201d said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, a member of the Senate Republican leadership. \u201cWe\u2019re at a point where our friends no longer trust us, our enemies don\u2019t fear us, and it\u2019s not just what\u2019s happening with Iran or Iraq. You see it with Russia.\u201dThe focus on foreign policy represents a return by Republicans to their more hawkish national security roots after recent party discord over how aggressively the United States should pursue intervention overseas.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, noted that the rift in Republican ranks between interventionists like himself and Senator John McCain of Arizona and more libertarian Republicans like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has significantly diminished in light of the rise of the Islamic State and mounting terrorism concerns.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a common view from a Republican point of view of the role of national security,\u201d Mr. Graham said.He said the terrorism threat and the fear of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons ability had brought the party\u2019s congressional leaders and possible presidential candidates close together on foreign policy.\u201cOn the domestic side, not so much,\u201d he acknowledged.The new Republican emphasis on foreign policy also has its practical value, providing a distraction from Republican failures on domestic policy.It was hardly a coincidence that Speaker John A. Boehner informed House Republicans that they were unconditionally surrendering in their fight against Mr. Obama on immigration on the same morning that Mr. Netanyahu was to deliver a scorching reproach of the president from the House chamber. The prospect of the Israeli prime minister\u2019s dressing down the president at the invitation of the speaker muted any backlash, and House conservatives went quickly and quietly.Mr. Boehner has since invited the president of Ukraine, another place where congressional Republicans favor a more aggressive United States role than the White House does, to address Congress in September.The foreign policy push against the administration has drawn many detractors among Democrats and even respected Republican foreign policy veterans.They warn that lawmakers are treading into dangerous territory and setting precedents they may come to regret by first arranging the address by Mr. Netanyahu without informing the White House and then taking it upon themselves to write to Iran that any agreement with Mr. Obama might not hold up once he is gone.Even some of the seven Senate Republicans who did not join their 47 colleagues in signing the letter despite their support of legislation requiring congressional review of any future nuclear deal suggested that it was ineffective and ill timed.\u201cI don\u2019t think that the ayatollah is going to be particularly convinced by a letter from members of the Senate, even one signed by a number of my distinguished and high-ranking colleagues,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. She said the focus should be on \u201ckeeping the pressure on the president to make a good deal, not a bad agreement.\u201dWhite House officials and congressional Democrats have savaged the missive to Iran as an outrageous breach of precedent and protocol that diminishes the nation\u2019s standing and credibility.\u201cWe are witnessing a fundamental test of Republicans\u2019 ability to govern,\u201d Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said Wednesday. \u201cThey are treating nuclear negotiations as a chance to play games.\u201dNo signer of the letter has backed away from it, although a few have suggested that it could have been handled better. But most who signed it dismiss such criticism as overwrought. They say they have every right as members of Congress to express their views to foreign leaders.\u201cThis indignation and breast-beating over this letter is absolute nonsense,\u201d Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, said.One unknown for Republicans is how voters will respond. Independents traditionally favor a bipartisan approach to foreign policy, and the fight could potentially turn them off.Despite the emerging foreign policy consensus, Republicans may soon face a situation where their unity on that front collides with differences on domestic policy.Mr. Graham, Mr. McCain and others want to ease spending limits imposed on the Pentagon a few years ago in a bipartisan budget deal so that the military can be prepared to carry out new operations overseas against the Islamic State and elsewhere if necessary, a view that has strong Pentagon support.But Republican fiscal hawks in the House and Senate adamantly oppose relaxing the limits on the Pentagon, fearing the move will hamper attempts to balance the budget and spur demands for higher domestic spending as well.That looming budget debate promises to test what truly comes first for congressional Republicans \u2014 domestic policy or an ambitious foreign policy agenda.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Strength Is Weakness", "Date": "2015-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe\u2019ve been warned over and over that the Federal Reserve, in its effort to improve the economy, is \u201cdebasing\u201d the dollar. The archaic word itself tells you a lot about where the people issuing such warnings are coming from. It\u2019s an allusion to the ancient practice of replacing pure gold or silver coins with \u201cdebased\u201d coins in which the precious-metal content was adulterated with cheaper stuff. Message to the gold bugs and Ayn Rand disciples who dominate the Republican Party: That\u2019s not how modern money works. Still, the Fed\u2019s critics keep insisting that easy-money policies will lead to a plunging dollar.Or not. Actually, the strong dollar is bad for America. In an immediate sense, it will weaken our long-delayed economic recovery by widening the trade deficit. In a deeper sense, the message from the dollar\u2019s surge is that we\u2019re less insulated than many thought from problems overseas. In particular, you should think of the strong dollar/weak euro combination as the way Europe exports its troubles to the rest of the world, America very much included.This remarkable situation makes even those low, low U.S. returns look attractive by comparison. So capital is heading our way, driving the euro down and the dollar up.Who wins from this market move? Europe: a weaker euro makes European industry more competitive against rivals, boosting both exports and firms that compete with imports, and the effect is to mitigate the euroslump. Who loses? We do, as our industry loses competitiveness, not just in European markets, but in countries where our exports compete with theirs. America has been experiencing a modest manufacturing revival in recent years, but that revival will be cut short if the dollar stays this high for long.In effect, then, Europe is managing to export some of its stagnation to the rest of us. We\u2019re not talking about a nefarious plot, about so-called currency wars; it\u2019s just the way things work in a global economy with highly mobile capital and market-determined exchange rates. Oh, and one more thing: a lot of businesses around the world have borrowed heavily in dollars, which means that a rising dollar may create a whole new set of debt crises. Just what the global economy needed.Is there a policy moral to all this? One thing is that it\u2019s really important for all of us that Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank and associates succeed in steering Europe away from a deflationary trap; the euro is their currency, but it turns out to be our problem. Mainly, though, this is another reason for the Fed to fight the urge to pretend that the crisis is over. Don\u2019t raise rates until you see the whites of inflation\u2019s eyes! Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Approves Bill on Changes to Medicare", "Date": "2015-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House overwhelmingly approved sweeping changes to the Medicare program on Thursday in the most significant bipartisan policy legislation to pass through that chamber since Republicans regained a majority in 2011.The measure, which would establish a new formula for paying doctors, increase premiums for some Medicare beneficiaries and extend a popular health insurance program for children, has already been endorsed by President Obama and awaits a vote in the Senate. The legislation, approved in the House by a vote of 392 to 37, embodies a rare and significant agreement negotiated by Speaker John A. Boehner and the House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California. Both saw the value in ending a problem that has bedeviled the nation\u2019s health care system for more than a decade, and in demonstrating that the nation\u2019s legislative branch could function. Mr. Obama called Mr. Boehner and Ms. Pelosi to congratulate them after the vote. \u201cThis is how Congress is supposed to work,\" Mr. Obama said, addressing students at a community college in Birmingham, Ala.Lawmakers could not immediately recall the last time a bill of such consequence had passed with a huge majority in the era of divided government, when merely keeping federal agencies from shutting down counts as a major achievement. \u201cNormally we\u2019d be here to admit that we are going to kick the can down the road one more time,\u201d Mr. Boehner said. \u201cThis is what we can accomplish when we\u2019re focused on finding common ground.\u201d Marilyn Moon, a health economist and former trustee of the Medicare program, said the vote Thursday had far-reaching implications. \u201cIf doctors respond to the incentives in this bill, they will have to change the way they do business,\u201d Ms. Moon said. \u201cNow doctors get paid more if they do more. In the future, they will be paid more if they do it better \u2014 and may be paid more for doing less.\u201d Whether the bipartisan accomplishment represents a passing moment of harmony or signals a new period of cooperation remains to be seen. Many other issues, like the expiration of highway funds and an ambitious rewrite of the tax code, await.Mr. Boehner\u2019s strategy of working out a significant legislative compromise with Ms. Pelosi was a break from his prior attempts to mollify his most conservative House colleagues. \u201cWe are showing that we have a majority that\u2019s working,\u201d said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, \u201cand when we see opportunities to find common ground, we are moving forward on big things.\u201dFor her part, Ms. Pelosi, who turned 75 on Thursday, again demonstrated that even as the leader of a minority party that is sometimes restless for fresh leadership, she could win policy fights for Democrats while persuading them to compromise. Mr. Boehner lost just 33 Republicans on the bill, and only four Democrats voted no. Democrats were pleased that the bill extended some of their favorite programs and did not attempt to roll back the Affordable Care Act, as Republicans have repeatedly tried to do. Republicans felt they had won because, as Mr. Boehner said, the bill made a start on \u201creal entitlement reform\u201d without the tax increases often sought by Democrats.Under the bill, Medicare would pay doctors based on their performance, rewarding them for higher-quality work rather than the volume of services. The Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program would be extended for two years, rather than the four years sought by Democrats. More money also would be appropriated for community health centers, with a restriction for abortion services.To help offset the costs, some higher-income Medicare beneficiaries would be required to pay higher premiums for coverage of doctors\u2019 services and prescription drugs. But about two-thirds of the costs would be added to the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would add $141 billion to federal budget deficits in the coming decade, compared with existing law.Members of both parties went to the House floor on Thursday for what was officially a debate, but sounded more like a wedding, with lawmakers speaking of the measure as benefiting elderly Medicare patients, children and taxpayers. \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect bill,\u201d said Representative Ami Bera, Democrat of California, who is a physician. \u201cBut I came to Congress to put people first. I came to Congress to work across the aisle in a bipartisan way to put our country first.\u201d Senate Democrats have been resistant to provisions in the bill that preserve restrictions on the use of federal money for abortion services and extend the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program for only two years, rather than four. House Democrats who also disliked those provisions said they got the best they could. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, said: \u201cThat certainly was a big vote in the House. We need to look at the details.\u201d The lopsided vote in the House will probably help bring along members of both parties in the Senate, which is unlikely to vote before a two-week recess scheduled to start Friday. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have the votes,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania. Several conservatives expressed concern about the bill\u2019s effects on the deficit, including Senator Ben Sasse, a freshman Republican from Nebraska, and Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, who said the bill \u201cis exciting for someone but not necessarily me.\u201d Doctors face a 21 percent cut in Medicare fees on April 1 unless Congress takes action. Such a reduction would almost surely prompt some doctors to accept fewer Medicare patients. Medicare officials could stretch the deadline and delay the cuts for about two weeks.Since 2003, Congress has passed 17 short-term bills to block cuts in Medicare doctors\u2019 fees, which are calculated under a formula that defines a \u201csustainable growth rate\u201d linked to growth of the overall economy. The Boehner-Pelosi bill repeals that formula.Representative Michael C.

{"Headline": "Tunisia Museum Attack Is Blow to Nation\u2019s Democratic Shift", "Date": "2015-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 Gunmen in military uniforms killed 19 people on Wednesday in a midday attack on a museum in downtown Tunis, dealing a new blow to the tourist industry that is vital to Tunisia as it struggles to consolidate the only transition to democracy after the Arab Spring revolts.Tunisian officials had initially said that the attackers took 10 hostages and killed nine people, including seven foreign visitors and two Tunisians. When security forces retook the museum about four hours later, however, the death toll more than doubled, raising questions about how and at what point the hostages had died.Prime Minister Habib Essid said in a news conference that security forces had killed two gunmen inside the museum but that two or three accomplices might still be at large. He said 17 foreign visitors \u2014 including Polish, Italian, Spanish and German tourists \u2014 as well as two Tunisians, one of whom was a member of the security forces, had been killed in the attack. At least 22 others were wounded.Mr. Essid urged national unity, calling the attack \u201cthe first operation of its kind ever to occur in Tunisia\u201d because it struck the crucial tourist economy. \u201cWe will show no compassion and no mercy in defending our country,\u201d he said.The two gunmen killed were believed to be Tunisians, he said. Yet their identities and motivations were not immediately clear, and there was no claim of responsibility.Democracy has provided new freedom of speech for the group\u2019s recruiters, and it is easy to find young Tunisians captivated by promises of justice and opportunity as they struggle under the weight of an economy suffering from years of tumult and an abusive police force left over from the old authoritarian system.There was no specific evidence by Wednesday night linking the museum attack to the Islamic State, but its supporters circulated celebratory messages on social media, often citing a video released online in December.Gunshots were heard in the area around 12:30 p.m., just as buses from cruise ships docked in the harbor were unloading hundreds of tourists, witnesses said. The two gunmen, moving easily through the crowds because of their uniforms, were armed with grenades and Kalashnikovs, officials said.Noriko Yuki, 35, a Japanese tourist, reached Tunis on Wednesday morning on a cruise from Italy with her mother, Nobuko. They heard bullets flying over their heads and dropped to the ground, the younger Ms. Yuki said, but one wounded her cheek.\u201cI started shaking my mother to see if she was alive, but she was not responding,\u201d Ms. Yuki said in an interview at the hospital where she was taken by the police. \u201cI lost track of her.\u201dMost of the crowds escaped. Military helicopters swooped overhead, the Parliament building was evacuated and the district was closed off. Video on state television showed terrified tourists crouching and scurrying out of a doorway and up a stairway, guided by heavily armed riot police. Both the police and tourists glanced nervously skyward, as though afraid of a gunman on a nearby rooftop.Complaints about a failure to stop lesser attacks by Islamist extremists dogged Ennahda, the moderate Islamist party that led the constituent assembly elected after the revolution. The newly elected president, Beji Caid Essebsi, a former interior minister under the old autocracy who campaigned on the promise of a restoration of stability and a crackdown on extremism, and his anti-Islamist political faction won a plurality of the new Parliament.The bloodshed on Wednesday raised fears that the new government might be tempted to turn back toward authoritarianism in its effort to stamp out terrorist threats. It also raised questions about whether Mr. Essebsi\u2019s more secular faction might now be blamed for failing to solve the problem more effectively than the Islamists who led the transition.Ennahda called for a public rally against terrorism on Wednesday evening and \u201ca national conference to set a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy.\u201d But in television appearances, its officials also criticized what they called a lack of transparency about the deaths of the hostages and the police operation.The Bardo Museum houses a large collection of antiquities, including many important mosaics dating from the Roman and Carthaginian era, as well as Phoenician and Byzantine ceramics, statuary and jewelry.In Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere, militants have sometimes destroyed ancient cultural artifacts that they deemed un-Islamic. But Unesco, the United Nations cultural agency, said in a statement Wednesday evening that there was no sign of damage to the museum or its collection.Since the revolution in 2011, the Tunisian authorities have struggled to eradicate Islamist militants in regions far from the coast, but the assault on Wednesday was especially damaging because European tourists are the lifeblood of the Tunisian economy and its main source of foreign currency.The office of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France confirmed late Wednesday that two French citizens had died in the Tunis attack and that seven others were wounded.In Tokyo, a government spokesman said that three Japanese had been killed. In a statement, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said that Japan was \u201crendered speechless to think of how the families of the victims must be feeling.\u201dA spokesman for the Italian Foreign Ministry said at least three Italians had been among those killed in the attack, and at least six had been wounded.Piero Fassino, the mayor of Turin, Italy, told Italian television that six City Hall employees had been in Tunis, but that only two had been heard from. \u201cWe are waiting for news with a certain anguish,\u201d he said.An article on Thursday about a massacre at a museum in downtown Tunis misspelled the given name of one of those injured, a Japanese tourist. She is Nobuko Yuki, not Nobuku.Reporting was contributed by Farid Farid, Hend Hassassi and Farah Samti from Tunis; Ma\u00efa de la Baume from Paris; Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome; Mayy El Sheikh from Cairo; and Tom Mashberg from Boston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Greece, Syriza Struggles to Deliver Promises as Money Runs Out", "Date": "2015-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Venizelos, once a powerful minister given the task of defending austerity, offered a disgusted opinion: Who are you kidding?\u201cYou were grossly unprepared and na\u00efve,\u201d Mr. Venizelos boomed during last Friday\u2019s debate over a government amnesty program to collect unpaid taxes. He added: \u201cThe government is fooling itself by using double talk. They are saying one thing in the country and another thing to the lenders.\u201dInfighting is worsening as hard-core leftist factions grow frustrated by some of the compromises made by Mr. Tsipras in his continuing negotiations with creditors. Critics on the left and right are questioning whether the government has a viable plan to restart economic growth. And still unresolved is whether the government can strike a deal with Europe to keep the country afloat, an issue that will be front and center on Monday, when Mr. Tsipras meets in Berlin with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.Greece\u2019s finances have deteriorated as postelection anxiety over uncertainty about the bailout spurred a spike in bank withdrawals. Tax collections also plunged, raising questions about whether the government would be able to pay state workers and meet other obligations.On Feb. 20, Greek leaders signed a four-month bailout extension with its three main creditors \u2014 the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission. Yet creditors have refused to release a critical 7.2-billion-euro, or about $7.8 billion, loan payment (money that Syriza had once vowed not to accept but that is now badly needed) until the government provides a list of acceptable structural reforms to replace pension cuts and other austerity measures that had been under consideration by the previous government.Having held office for only two months, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government might seem to be facing grossly unrealistic expectations, yet they are largely self-imposed. During the campaign, Mr. Tsipras told buoyant crowds that Syriza would repeal punitive austerity laws \u2014 practically on Day 1 \u2014 rehire fired public workers, stop privatizations of state-owned assets, force creditors to write down the national debt and tackle the corrupt oligarchical business elites that dominate the economy.As yet, none of that has happened, and the contentious talks with European creditors have created a sense of parallel realities, as Mr. Tsipras and his outspoken finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, continue to declare that Greece, not the lenders, are winning the standoff, even as they have already retreated from some campaign promises.On the streets of Athens, Syriza remains popular even as many people say they are waiting for action. Antigovernment protests had mostly dissipated in the weeks after Syriza\u2019s election. Yet on Friday, a youth wing of the Communist Party staged a demonstration outside a Finance Ministry building as it revived demands for the reinstatement of slashed university funds.Syriza leaders reject any suggestion that European creditors are forcing them to walk the same line as their predecessors. Syriza had denounced the past government, a coalition led by the center-right New Democracy party, for allowing bureaucrats from creditor institutions to wield veto power on legislation.\u201cThese bills will be written here, because we will not continue the practice of having technocrats writing our bills,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said last week as the government introduced its first major piece of legislation, named the humanitarian bill, to provide relief to the poor.Even as some European leaders have criticized Mr. Tsipras and Mr. Varoufakis for their confrontational approach to debt negotiations \u2014 and have accused them of stoking nationalist anger \u2014 the Greek public seems undisturbed. A new poll by Metron Analysis, sampling 1,000 people across the country, found that 41.9 percent of respondents would vote for Syriza if a new election were held, more than double the share of the New Democracy party.Yet if still popular, Syriza is not united. Over all, Greeks appear overwhelmingly to want to remain in the eurozone. Yet analysts and past polls suggest that Syriza partisans are much more divided, a split that reflects other tensions. One far-left faction, led by Panagiotis Lafazanis, a government minister, is already pushing back against compromises that Mr. Tsipras has made to creditors on privatizing state assets.\u201cLafazanis has vowed to stop any privatizations that fall under his jurisdiction,\u201d said Vasiliki Siouti, a liberal political commentator who has written extensively about Syriza. She said some leftists had also questioned why the party had not yet moved to investigate and to tax business oligarchs long suspected of corruption. Others are frustrated that the government hasn\u2019t yet repealed the existing terms of the bailout, known as the memorandum.\u201cThey basically have accepted the memorandum,\u201d Ms. Siouti added. \u201cThey have not annulled it.\u201dSome Syriza lawmakers have bluntly warned that the government has done too little to prepare for the possibility of a crisis \u2014 even a potential exit from the euro. Costas Lapavitsas, a Syriza lawmaker who in the past has supported leaving the euro, recently warned that an informed public debate over a Greek exit from the single currency is needed because party leaders know they cannot reconcile their political program with the demands of creditors.Greek news media are reporting that when Mr. Tsipras meets with Ms. Merkel on Monday, he will push for a compromise on privatizations.In Athens, the government will continue rolling out its initial legislative program, after a delayed start. The humanitarian law provides subsidies on food, electricity, rent and public transportation to the desperately poor \u2014 fulfilling a campaign promise, even if the financial support is narrower than originally expected.Friday\u2019s debate was over legislation to provide an installment plan that would allow citizens or companies to repay overdue taxes while waiving penalties. Greek taxpayers owe the government \u20ac78 billion in arrears, and Syriza lawmakers expect the legislation to provide an influx of cash to state coffers as well as relief to citizens who had been facing legal action.Yet in Parliament, opposition lawmakers seized on the title of the legislation \u2014 \u201cRebooting the Economy\u201d \u2014 as an opportunity to pillory the government for lacking a real growth plan.Adonis Georgiadis, a minister in the former government, said Syriza would eventually be forced to pass new austerity measures to appease creditors, or face a catastrophe if the loan money was shut off.\u201cYou cannot admit that you are signing a new memorandum,\u201d he said mockingly. \u201cWe want to welcome you to the memorandum.\u201dThe new government is facing other challenges. On Sunday, a Greek newspaper reported that George Katrougalos, the deputy minister for administrative reform, had used his government position to help former law clients, an assertion that he and Syriza flatly denied.Not far from Parliament, Evangelia Alexaki was also watching her new government with high expectations. She is a leader of a group of cleaning ladies who became national symbols of the harshness of austerity when they were fired from their jobs in the Finance Ministry. They have been sleeping in tents outside the ministry for months, demanding to be reinstated, and Syriza has pledged to introduce legislation soon to rehire them and other fired workers.\u201cIf the government does not deliver,\u201d she said, \u201cthey will find us against them.\u201dDimitris Bounias contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Andalusia Election a Measure of Spain\u2019s Disillusionment", "Date": "2015-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut as Andalusia votes Sunday in a regional election that may serve as a bellwether for national elections this year, the Socialists enter the balloting as a party badly tarnished by corruption scandals and a regional unemployment rate of 34 percent, 10 percentage points above the national average.Though the Socialists are nonetheless expected to come out on top, the vote on Sunday is being closely watched as a measure of just how fractured Spain\u2019s political landscape has become, as disillusionment with established parties seeps into the electorate.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in 35 years that nobody here knows what the outcome of the vote will be \u2014 and that in itself shows we\u2019ve come to the end of a political cycle, not only in Andalusia but in the whole of Spain,\u201d said Teresa Rodr\u00edguez, 33, the lead candidate for Podemos, a left-wing party that is barely a year old and is having its first test in a Spanish election on Sunday.Asked whether the region would suffer if Sunday\u2019s result was a highly fragmented regional Parliament, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ve had plenty of government stability, but that hasn\u2019t yielded policies that have really helped citizens.\u201dNevertheless, the same poll showed two insurgent parties, Podemos and another newcomer, Ciudadanos, receiving a combined quarter of respondents\u2019 support, which would most likely make them kingmakers in the regional Parliament. The poll, conducted March 5-11, was based on 3,200 interviews and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.For Podemos, which was founded on a shoestring in early 2014, the election is the first important test of whether its radical anti-austerity message can allow it to mirror the success of Syriza, the left-wing party that swept to power in Greece in January.For Ciudadanos, Sunday\u2019s vote should help establish whether the party can transcend its Catalan roots and transform itself from a regional, anti-secession party into a national and centrist political force.Both Podemos and Ciudadanos are fielding candidates with limited political experience who are urging voters to clean up Spanish politics by turning their backs on Spain\u2019s two traditional parties, the Socialists and the Popular Party of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.\u201cWhat is clear is that we need to change the way politics is run,\u201d said Carlos Castilla Alonso, a 28-year-old software developer who said he planned to vote for Podemos on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen here just what happens when a party stays in power for more than 30 years, which is corruption to the point of stealing money from our unemployed.\u201dLast month, the Spanish Supreme Court named two former Socialist heads of Andalusia\u2019s regional government as suspects, joining other Socialist officials who were previously indicted on suspicion of having orchestrated a widespread unemployment benefit fraud scheme.Under that scheme, several politicians and labor union officials, as well as their friends and relatives, are alleged to have falsely claimed payments from a fund established by the Socialist regional government to pay compensation to people who had lost their jobs.But since 2013, when she took over as the Socialist government leader in Andalusia, Susana D\u00edaz, 40, has vowed zero tolerance toward corruption, while forcefully blaming Mr. Rajoy\u2019s austerity cuts for Andalusia\u2019s economic troubles, which are among the worst in the country.\u201cSusana D\u00edaz has developed a personal populistic style, not far from Argentine Peronism, in which she claims to represent and talk on behalf of the whole Andalusian people, caring for their problems against the central government,\u201d said Manuel Arias Maldonado, a politics professor at the University of M\u00e1laga.\u201cThat is why Podemos is not able to damage her so much,\u201d he added. \u201cShe is more of a populist than them.\u201dIndeed, the region presents a rare test in particular for Podemos, which has cast itself as anti-establishment and anti-austerity, but pro-European Union.Though the European Union is linked to the steep budget cuts that have hurt so many Spaniards, here it is also held in high regard for having helped develop this farming region of 8.4 million, almost a fifth of Spain\u2019s population, after Spain entered the European Union in 1986 under a Socialist government led by an Andalusian prime minister, Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez.\u201cHe really helped Andalusia receive significant European financial aid,\u201d said Antonio L\u00f3pez, the president of the audit chamber of Andalusia, which reports to the regional Parliament.\u201cI think many people still recognize just how far this region had been from European levels of convergence and how improved Andalusia became after Spain got to enter the E.U.\u201dEven as Andalusia has been among regions to continue to struggle with high debt and widespread unemployment in the aftermath of Spain\u2019s construction downturn, Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government has recently been claiming the credit for putting Spain back on track, after its economy grew 1.4 percent last year.Such renewed economic solidity, however, could be offset by unprecedented political fragmentation and future tensions among parties elected on the back of radically different agendas, some analysts warn.The Andalusian vote, which comes ahead of more regional elections in May and general elections around November, could \u201cpresage the difficult politics that Spain is likely to experience,\u201d according to a report published last week by Antonio Barroso, an analyst at Teneo Intelligence, a think tank based in London.\u201cWhile coalition governments can be successful in implementing economic reforms,\u201d he noted. \u201cSpain has no experience with such arrangements at the national level.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Central Bank Warns of Temporary Return to Deflation", "Date": "2015-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Over the last two years, the Japanese central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, has accomplished what a string of more cautious predecessors failed to do: reverse a prolonged and damaging slide in the price of goods and services in Japan.But on Tuesday, Mr. Kuroda acknowledged that his aggressive campaign to create inflation \u2014 seen as crucial to rekindling growth in the world\u2019s third-largest economy \u2014 had stalled.At a news conference after the central bank\u2019s latest monetary policy meeting, Mr. Kuroda said prices might turn \u201cslightly negative,\u201d meaning a return to deflation, or broadly falling prices, with which Japan has struggled since the late 1990s.His comment followed an official assessment by the Bank of Japan that consumer prices would most likely stop rising \u201cfor the time being.\u201dIt was the first time that Mr. Kuroda or his institution had formally acknowledged that prices were leveling off, although the bank\u2019s preferred measure of inflation has been declining for about a year.The bank predicted the lull in inflation would be temporary, however. It said in its assessment that prices would eventually start rising, spurred by low unemployment and rising incomes, though it did not say when that might happen. It chose not to modify the expansive bond-buying program it has been using to encourage inflation, keeping its target for purchases of government debt at 80 trillion yen, or about $660 billion, a year.Mr. Kuroda was appointed Bank of Japan governor by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2013, with a mandate to pull Japan out of deflation by whatever means necessary. He immediately ordered a sharp increase in the bank\u2019s bond buying, then expanded it again late last year.Mr. Kuroda and his supporters argue that a \u201cdeflationary mind-set\u201d is behind many of Japan\u2019s economic woes. Weak consumer spending and a reluctance by investors and businesses to take financial risks are evidence of that, they say.Changing that mind-set has proved difficult. Mr. Kuroda\u2019s goal of achieving 2 percent inflation by the middle of this year is looking impossible. The Consumer Price Index, or C.P.I., rose by just 0.2 percent in January, the latest month for which nationwide data are available, after excluding the effect of some volatile items and changes in taxes.The main culprit has been the decline in oil prices that began last summer. It has had a paradoxical effect on Japan: Because the country relies heavily on imported energy, most economists agree the fall has helped the economy as a whole. Yet making gasoline and other mainstay energy-related items cheaper has made Mr. Kuroda\u2019s inflationary mission more difficult.He characterized the situation as temporary, however \u2014 a pause rather than an outright breakdown in the intended effects of the central bank\u2019s inflation program, which it calls qualitative and quantitative easing, or Q.Q.E.It its written assessment, the Bank of Japan said, \u201cThe year-on-year rate of increase in the C.P.I. is likely to be about zero percent for the time being, due to the effects of the decline in energy prices.\u201dOne reason Mr. Kuroda thinks inflation will pick up again is the labor market. Unemployment is at its lowest level since 1997, at just 3.5 percent, empowering workers to negotiate higher wages.Toyota, for instance, is preparing to offer its workers the largest pay increase in 13 years, Japanese news media reported on Tuesday.The results of annual wage negotiations between the carmaker and its unions \u2014 known as shunto, or spring battle \u2014 are scheduled to be announced on Wednesday, and are expected to serve as a benchmark for other large Japanese corporations.Naohiko Baba, the chief Japan economist at Goldman Sachs, said the Bank of Japan was unlikely to undertake any further stimulus measures until the outcome of the annual pay talks and its likely effect on inflation became clearer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Rural India, Hoping for Jobs and Education in a Growing Economy ", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorial ObserverBHESDA KHURD, India \u2014 To begin to understand the hurdles Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces in building India into an economic powerhouse and reducing extreme poverty, the rural village of Bhesda Khurd, about 45 minutes from the western city of Udaipur, is a good place to start.It is here where Rohit Nagda, a 29-year-old computer software engineer, lives with his wife, a would-be teacher studying for a master\u2019s degree, and his family. Though he has a degree in computer science from a local university and spent a two-year stint as a commercial web developer that ended last year, Mr. Nagda is losing hope. He has been applying online for web jobs at companies in distant Mumbai, India\u2019s financial center, but has yet to find work.Seated next to him on a mat in front of the local Hindu temple was Shankar Donge, 26, who runs a small pharmacy near the Udaipur airport but would rather work for a big pharmaceutical company where the benefits are better. \u201cTo get a good job, you need to move out of the village, but it\u2019s not talent that gets you big jobs but jack,\u201d he says, meaning political influence or a bribe. He adds that \u201cvery often you have to pay people to make the call\u201d just to get a job referral.Two-thirds of India\u2019s more than 1.2 billion people are under the age of 35. Nowhere is the demand for jobs more acute, and the obstacles more formidable, than in rural areas that are home to more than 70 percent of India\u2019s population, including the 450 households in this village.In many ways, Mr. Nagda and his friends, who also went to college or technical school, are better off than those who live on the poorer side of the village, a 10-minute drive away. Mr. Nagda\u2019s father helps run the water department at Hindustan Zinc, a local mining company. Most of their neighbors are farmers, and some own cows and goats. Others pick up itinerant work as migrants in Udaipur, or even Gujarat, an eight-hour bus ride away. In their neighborhood, there is a portion of a paved road and minimal drainage and electricity, and some houses are made of concrete. A few have toilets.In the poorer section where lower-caste families live, there is no water piped to houses, which are mostly made of mud, less electricity and no paved road. The fondest wish of Sarjan Bai Jogi, mother of six children and grandmother of eight, is a house where \u201cyou don\u2019t get wet when it rains,\u201d she said through an interpreter.We met on the shore of a small lake where her family has lived and worked for 60 years. They survive, barely, on fishing and jobs as laborers, stone crushers and cement mixers. Her youngest son is the most educated; he finished seventh grade.Among several dozen other women I met in this hamlet, only one went as high as eighth grade; only one young man had a college degree. He was earning money as a part-time wedding photographer because he couldn\u2019t find work in his field. In recent years, the village public school expanded from eight grades to 10. For now, students who want to finish 11th and 12th grades must travel to Udaipur, a hardship for many families who can\u2019t afford the expense and fear for their daughters\u2019 safety.The expansion of education has made a difference in nationwide literacy rates. While very few villagers over age 60 have any formal education, more than 90 percent of the younger generation are attending primary school, according to Anirudh Krishna, a Duke University professor who has been doing research in this region for a decade and traveled with me to this village. But going on to high school and college remains rare. Fewer than 7 percent of Indians (only 4.4 percent of young adults in rural areas) have a college education, and, as Mr. Nagda discovered, even that is no guarantee of success.For all of India\u2019s advancement \u2014 it has one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies \u2014 fewer than 10 percent of workers have regular jobs with legal protections and social security benefits and as much as 5 percent of the population falls into poverty every year, Mr. Krishna said. Mr. Modi\u2019s plans for economic growth rest largely on wooing foreign investment, making India a global manufacturing hub and developing a defense industry. And he has set ambitious goals, including building 40 million rural homes with toilets by 2022.Economic expansion will mean millions of people moving from the countryside to the cities, as it has been in most countries, including China. But India is a nation of villages, with a population that has survived for decades on government handouts, without real opportunities for jobs or a way out of grinding poverty.I asked the women of Bhesda Khurd if they thought a future Indian prime minister could come from their village. Mr. Modi, after all, rose to power from the lowly rung of a tea seller. \u201cYes,\u201d one woman replied, \u201cif there is education and hard work.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Everyone is questioning their role in the industry.\u201dWhile sales of traditional laptop computers have stalled worldwide, shipments of smartphones \u2014 some of which now sell for as little as $25 \u2014 are expected to hit almost two billion units this year, according to the technology research company Gartner.At the same time, upgrades to carriers\u2019 networks, particularly in the United States, Europe and parts of Asia, have increased mobile Internet speeds to a level that allows consumers to carry out many tasks \u2014 like online banking, e-commerce and Internet messaging \u2014 that, until recently, had been restricted to computers.\u201cMobile has become the heart of the Internet,\u201d said Anne Bouverot, director general of the GSMA, an industry body that organizes the annual conference in Barcelona, known as Mobile World Congress. This shift has led to some uneasy relationships between telecom and tech companies.For many carriers, which have invested billions of dollars in recent years to upgrade their networks, growing consumer appetite for services like streaming from Netflix has raised fears that telecom operators will be relegated merely to providing the infrastructure that powers the boom in mobile Internet.Telecom executives worry that this role will force operators to miss out on the growing revenue that flows into smartphone applications, Internet gaming and other services, which all run on top of their networks. The concerns come as many carriers\u2019 revenues \u2014 particularly in Europe, whose economy continues to stutter \u2014 have leveled off.Some industry insiders also have expressed frustration that American tech giants like Google and Amazon, which have used complicated tax structures to reduce their global tax burdens, do not face the same levels of regulatory scrutiny as carriers. That includes the F.C.C.\u2019s net neutrality decision last week, which will allow the agency to treat broadband Internet access as a public utility for regulatory purposes.\u201cWe always pay taxes in Europe,\u201d Pierre Louette, deputy chief executive at the French telecom operator Orange, told an industry conference late last year, in a jab at the Silicon Valley giants. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to be overregulated while they are not regulated.\u201dAt the same time, several tech giants have gained footholds in areas traditionally dominated by the big telecom companies.Google, for example, is introducing fiber-optic networks in several American cities, offering television and Internet services at speeds of up to one gigabit a second, 100 times as fast as the average Internet connection. The search giant is running other pilot projects in emerging markets, including Kampala, Uganda, to build Internet infrastructure not offered by local carriers. And Facebook now competes head-on with traditional telecom players after acquiring WhatsApp, the Internet messaging service, last year for $19 billion. Along with Facebook Messenger, the company\u2019s separate messaging service, Facebook now has hundreds of millions of mobile users who have shifted from traditional text messaging \u2014 a once highly lucrative revenue source for carriers \u2014 to free Internet messaging on their mobile devices.\u201cOperators only have themselves to blame,\u201d said Steven Hartley, a telecom analyst at the research company Ovum in London. \u201cThey didn\u2019t adapt to the mobile shifts in the industry. They can\u2019t complain when others beat them to the punch.\u201dTo avoid falling further behind, operators are trying to adapt.Some, including Telef\u00f3nica of Spain and Deutsche Telekom, have opened their own start-up incubators to invest directly in fledgling companies that could one day compete with West Coast rivals. Peter Borchers, who runs Deutsche Telekom\u2019s start-up program, with offices in Berlin, Tel Aviv and Krakow, Poland, said the investments helped the carrier keep ahead of new tech developments like connected devices and smartwatches that might otherwise pass it by. Investments range from $112,000 to $335,000 for a stake of up to 10 percent in a start-up.\u201cThe investments have to be strategically relevant to Deutsche Telekom,\u201d Mr. Borchers said. \u201cIt helps us tap into future innovations.\u201dYet analysts say most operators do not have a good track record of spotting the latest tech trends. For that reason, some carriers have decided to forgo their own online services and team up with existing tech players. The goal is to bundle in-demand services, like mobile music or movie streaming, into monthly cellphone contracts, with both sides taking a percentage of the additional revenue.\u201cBy working with us, carriers often see a rise in the amount of mobile data people consume,\u201d said Cl\u00e9ment C\u00e9zard, head of business development at Deezer, a Paris-based music service similar to Spotify that has signed more than 30 deals with operators around the globe and now has more than six million paying subscribers worldwide. \u201cIt\u2019s all about partnerships,\u201d Mr. C\u00e9zard said. \u201cWe get more users, and they can offer people access to online music.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Richard Russo, Pulitzer Winner, Tells Gloversville Library Thanks for the Memories", "Date": "2015-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by6 PhotosGLOVERSVILLE, N.Y. \u2014 In 1904, Andrew Carnegie donated $50,000, then a princely sum, to this upstate community so it could build a new library. Now, 111 years later, that stately, domed Beaux-Arts structure has fallen on hard times, much like the black-and-blue, blue-collar town that surrounds it.The century-old boiler sometimes breaks. Some of the dark-wood shelving looks as if it barely survived World War I. The library is without wheelchair access and, lacking air-conditioning, it once had to close when the heat index inside soared to 113.In recent decades, town leaders have started three drives to raise funds to modernize the library, but those efforts foundered, largely because Gloversville, a city of 15,000 that once produced 90 percent of the nation\u2019s dress gloves, back when leather gloves were de rigueur, remains mired in its own Depression.Gloversville\u2019s economy collapsed and many of its factories were closed when American women stopped wearing leather gloves during the 1950s (the industry enjoyed a brief upsurge in 1961, after Jacqueline Kennedy wore gloves to her husband\u2019s inauguration). Nowadays, the town\u2019s finances are so battered that it has had to shut the public pool and the recreation department, both blows to Gloversville\u2019s children.Still, the city harbors hope for its library. With visions of a cheery new children\u2019s section with atrium windows as well as a gleaming reading room, the town has started a drive to raise $7 million for a renovation. It has raised $2.4 million so far.\u201cThis time we\u2019re not giving up,\u201d said Barbara Madonna, the library\u2019s executive director, whose office features a 1904 photo of a 10-foot-tall replica of the library, built of 20,000 spools of thread. \u201cWe need to do this renovation for the kids. A library is so important for them. And we need to do this as a catalyst to lift the whole town.\u201dTo help reach its goal, Gloversville has turned to its most famous son, Richard Russo, the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer, to serve as honorary chairman of the drive.Mr. Russo, now 65 and living in Portland, Me., has mined Gloversville\u2019s color, its characters and its woes for novels such as \u201cEmpire Falls,\u201d \u201cNobody\u2019s Fool\u201d and \u201cMohawk,\u201d even when the books were set in a fictional somewhere else.Mr. Russo grew up going to the Gloversville library, one of the nearly 1,700 built with Carnegie money. \u201cI have such fond memories of the place, going there Saturday mornings with my grandfather or mother, who would wait forever for me to pick books,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cI just have this feeling that if it weren\u2019t for the Gloversville Free Library that I probably would not be a writer.\u201dBefore getting involved in the campaign, he had not spent much time in Gloversville in many years.\u201cI have invented so many fictional Gloversvilles,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing back to the real place, there was something really odd about it. I just felt the way that Faulkner must have felt about his fictional county, probably the way Joyce felt about Dublin. It just behaves much better in my mind than in reality.\u201dThe library, with its majestic 35-foot-tall lobby, is one block from the Four Corners, the town\u2019s once-thriving main intersection. One corner is now an empty lot where a fire-damaged hotel was demolished. On Main Street, the Kasson Opera House closed long ago.Gloversville\u2019s mayor, Dayton J. King, hopes that a library renovation might spur a hoped-for renaissance downtown.\u201cWhen people see the library is changing, it looking and feeling totally different, it will increase people\u2019s confidence that this is not a bad place,\u201d Mr. King said.Attracting about 9,000 visitors a month, the library is already a gathering place. Parents take their toddlers to story time on Thursdays, while older users hold reading and knitting groups there. For teenagers, the library sponsors \u201cOff Line and Unplugged,\u201d an effort to get them to talk and play board games without their cellphones and computers.If the renovation proceeds, there will be bright, ample spaces where high school students can tutor younger students, chamber music concerts can be held, and the unemployed can use computers for job searches. Children will still be able to discover books the way a young Rick Russo came upon Jules Verne and Edgar Rice Burroughs.\u201cOne reason Mr. Russo is so interested in the renovation is there\u2019s very little place for children these days outside of school,\u201d said Elizabeth Batchelor, a chairwoman of the fund-raising campaign. \u201cFor many kids, a library can be a ladder out of poverty.\u201dVincent DeSantis, a retired city court judge, said that back in Gloversville\u2019s heyday, \u201cthe captains of industry lived in the community and supported the community.\u201d But now, with so many factories abandoned and so many businesses run by distant executives, he said, \u201cwe have to do it ourselves.\u201dHe hopes that a renovated library, together with the new Mohawk Harvest food co-op, which offers locally produced meat, cheeses, jams and apple butter, will create the momentum to turn the community around. The co-op, which contains an art gallery and a cafe, draws patrons from miles around.\u201cThis is a move to revitalize the downtown as the front porch of the community,\u201d Mr. DeSantis said, making a pitch that Gloversville, with its rock-bottom rents, handsome stone buildings and proximity to lakes and the Adirondack Mountains, would be an ideal site for young artists and craftspeople.But revitalizing the town could be a long shot, some residents acknowledge.Mr. Russo said that \u201cElsewhere\u201d was the first time he had written anything negative about Gloversville, but he said he was channeling his mother\u2019s, not his own, views. \u201cI wondered whether I burned a bridge in writing that book,\u201d he said.Some residents say his involvement in the library campaign is an effort at redemption. But Mr. Russo \u2014 whom many view as a hometown hero \u2014 said: \u201cRedemption might be a bit of a strong word. I don\u2019t see it as a redemption, but as a homecoming. If there was anything to forget or forgive, it\u2019s been forgotten and forgiven.\u201dHe said Gloversville has suffered the same fate as many American mill towns, adding that it was \u201cat the epicenter of my imagination.\u201cI do think I have a debt to pay, and I\u2019m happy to engage now in paying it back,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Israeli Election Turns Ugly ", "Date": "2015-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMr. Netanyahu showed that he was desperate, and craven, enough to pull out all the stops. On Monday, he promised that if his Likud faction remained in power, he would never allow the creation of a Palestinian state, thus repudiating a position he had taken in 2009.His behavior in the past six years \u2014 aggressively building Israeli homes on land that likely would be within the bounds of a Palestinian state and never engaging seriously in negotiations \u2014 has long convinced many people that he has no interest in a peace agreement. But his statement this week laid bare his duplicity, confirmed Palestinian suspicions and will make it even harder for him to repair his poisoned relations with President Obama, who has invested heavily in pushing a two-state solution.Mr. Netanyahu added to the ugliness of the campaign when, during Tuesday\u2019s voting, he said in a video on social media: \u201cRight-wing rule is in danger. Arab voters are streaming in huge quantities to the polling stations.\u201d This outrageous appeal to hard-line voters implied that only he could save Israel from its enemies, including the country\u2019s Arab citizens, who represent 20 percent of the population and have long been discriminated against. There were signs that Arab Israelis were turning out in somewhat higher numbers, apparently to vote for the Joint Arab List, a coalition of four small parties.Mr. Herzog made such domestic concerns a centerpiece of his campaign. While peace talks with the Palestinians were not a major focus of the Zionist Union campaign, or the election generally, he made clear that if elected he would try to restart negotiations.Late Tuesday, Mr. Rivlin said he would work for a national unity government with Likud and the Zionist Union. It is difficult to see how Mr. Netanyahu could find enough common ground with any moderate faction to govern constructively.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Now That Ben Bernanke Is Blogging, Here\u2019s What He Should Write About", "Date": "2015-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryday EconomicsBut as those of us who write about economics on the Internet can attest, it\u2019s not always easy figuring out what to write about. And while Mr. Bernanke may know more about many things than the rest of us, getting attention, and traffic, for economics writing on the web isn\u2019t among them. So here are some ideas to get him started.Other work has argued that this phenomenon is holding back the overall economy, as the wealthy save more than middle- and lower-income families. And regardless of whether you buy that idea, there is a moral argument that an economy failing to generate income gains for the bottom 95 percent of the population isn\u2019t an economy that\u2019s working very well.It\u2019s easy to forget, given that he presided over a period of interventionist policy by the Fed, but Mr. Bernanke is a Republican, and subscribes to a traditional center-right skepticism of the desirability of government intervention to try to correct perceived problems in the economy. But how have events of the last decade influenced his thinking on this crucial question of whether the government should do more to combat inequality?Mr. Bernanke tended to avoid taking a position on these questions as Fed chairman, viewing them as being outside his purview and more the stuff of partisan debates. As an outsider, now\u2019s the time for him to chime in.Are the people who worry about a dystopian future in which most of us have no real prospects for earning an income onto something, or is it more like bemoaning what the invention of the personal computer will do to the typewriter industry?In the past, Mr. Bernanke has tended toward techno-optimism, looking at the great advances in technology as a way to improve human welfare and make workers more productive (with higher incomes), rather than squeezing them out of work entirely.This is closely related to the \u201csecular stagnation\u201d debate that was kicked off in recent years by another former high-ranked economic policy maker, Larry Summers. It should be prime blogging territory for Mr. Bernanke, who has been thinking about these issues in great depth for much of his adult life.On one hand, this structure has created a high-performing, technocratic organization that employs some of the smartest people in government. On the other, it creates doubts about its legitimacy in a democratic society, particularly during the 2008 crisis when the Fed was choosing how to deploy hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer resources.What, then, are the lessons for American government? Should Congress be outsourcing more of its decision-making to independent technocrats? Or could the lawmaking process be reformed to keep decision-making in the hands of elected officials, but with better outcomes?Mr. Bernanke has seen the economic policy sausage made up close. Time to explain how we could get tastier sausages.On one hand, with baseball, unlike economic policy, Mr. Bernanke is just one more fan, albeit one who is uncommonly good at math. But that can be liberating! The chairman can offer his unbridled opinions about the Nats in a way he probably never will about monetary policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emerging Markets Lose Their Luster as Crises Mount", "Date": "2015-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Russia, it\u2019s assassinations and war. In Brazil, a corruption scandal may derail the economy. And in Turkey, the president is attacking the country\u2019s senior central banker.Emerging markets, not long ago seen as a necessary ingredient for the common portfolio, have lately taken on a more toxic quality as messy politics and staggering economies are prompting some investors to reassess their investment rationale.Compounding these concerns has been the dollar\u2019s upward march and the growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve will soon increase interest rates as the United States economy outpaces the rest of the world\u2019s.Emerging-market currencies, an accurate barometer of investor mood swings, are now suffering the consequences. The Turkish lira and the Brazilian real have touched multiyear lows against the dollar while the Russian ruble remains volatile after its 65 percent plunge.Even the currencies of economies seen to be in better shape, like the Mexican peso, which is trading at record lows against the dollar, and the Indian rupee are under pressure.\u201cYou are seeing all the bad things about emerging markets that originally made them sub-investment grade,\u201d said Daniel Tenengauzer, an emerging-market specialist at the Royal Bank of Canada. \u201cThe whole thesis that emerging markets are emerging is being questioned right now.\u201dMr. Tenengauzer points to Brazil as the main culprit. Allegations of kickbacks and bribes at Petrobras, the country\u2019s energy giant, threaten to engulf the country\u2019s business and economic elites. Petrobras, which has relied on global bond markets to finance its ambitious investment plans, is now retrenching \u2014 a bad omen for Brazil\u2019s investment-starved economy, which is not expect to grow this year.But the outlook is no better in Russia, where a war with Ukraine and President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s erratic ways \u2014 combined with a collapse in the price of oil \u2014 have rattled investors. And in Turkey, the country\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has added to existing currency jitters by suggesting that the head of the Turkish central bank is beholden to foreign speculators because he has not lowered interest rates fast enough.Beyond these surface problems are deeper vulnerabilities in these and other emerging markets that, analysts say, will become more acute as the dollar continues to race ahead.In a report published last week, Mr. Tenengauzer highlighted how, in the last five years of extraordinary central bank easing, emerging markets have taken on more debt as developed markets have done the opposite.This dollar-based leveraging up has been led by capital-hungry companies that cashed in on a broad investor desire for high-yielding bonds. Chinese short-term debt has exploded to $850 billion from $101 billion since 2008; in Brazil, the increase was to $112 billion from $47 billion, and Turkey\u2019s near-term liabilities jumped to $95 billion from $56 billion.When their currencies were strong and the dollar weak, such a strategy made sense. But when the reverse is true, foreign investors take their money elsewhere, and these dollar debts become harder to pay off.Of course, it is a mistake to treat emerging-market problems as uniform. For example, while Brazil and Russia suffered last year, stocks and bonds soared in India under a new reform-minded government. Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines also attracted investor interest because of their successful economic policies.And while currencies have been volatile, capital flows out of emerging markets, although weaker of late, have not yet approached the levels of a year ago.According to the Institute of International Finance, the trade group for global banks, global flows into emerging markets nearly halved last month, to $12 billion from $23 billion, with money flowing out of Brazil, Ukraine and Thailand and into Indonesia and India.Since the beginning of the year, investors in the world\u2019s largest emerging-markets investment vehicle, the $38 billion Oppenheimer developing markets fund, have withdrawn just $400 million \u2014 an amount by no means indicative of investor panic.Still, emerging-market experts say that the fact that the dollar is on a tear and that interest rates in the United States are moving up will entice investors to hunt for juicy returns in the United States as opposed to Brazil and Turkey.Further cementing the United States\u2019 appeal is rising doubt about senior-level decision making in some of the developing countries.In Turkey, for example, Mr. Erdogan has been pressuring his central bank, which is nominally independent, to bring interest rates down even though inflation remains high and the lira shaky.Standard economic theory has it that higher interest rates quell inflation and support the currency.\u201cThis is a vulnerable period,\u201d said Michael Harris, a Turkey specialist at Renaissance Capital in London. \u201cThe market assumes that Turkey is one of the big victims of Fed tightening, so we need a spell now when politicians don\u2019t throw more fuel on the fire.\u201dIn Brazil, the Petrobras scandal has added to longstanding fears that the country became too reliant on the commodity boom of the previous decade and gorged on debt.Now, with Petrobras debt being recently downgraded to junk status, investors fear that a downgrade of the country\u2019s government bonds could follow.So far this year, the Brazilian real has lost 15 percent and the Turkish lira has lost 12 percent against the dollar, making them the worst-performing currencies among major developing markets.Brazil and Turkey have taken steps to reassure investors.Late last year, President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, under fire for her ties to Petrobras, appointed a new market-friendly finance minister, Joaquim Levy, to oversee Brazil\u2019s cost-cutting drive.And last week, a weighty delegation of Turkish politicians, headlined by Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and the country\u2019s finance minister, swept into New York to meet with anxious fund managers.But as long as turmoil and scandal persist, such measures, while helpful, run the risk of being too little too late.Mr. Tenengauzer, the emerging-market expert, said he had been barraged by phone calls from investors about the chaos in these markets. \u201cIt\u2019s really affecting the asset class.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conservative Alliance Gains in French Voting", "Date": "2015-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The clear winner in the second round of France\u2019s local elections on Sunday was an alliance of conservative parties that took control of at least two-thirds of the country\u2019s departments, trouncing the Socialists.Voters were selecting 4,108 local council members who will run 98 of France\u2019s departments, local units of government that have limited powers over schools, roads and some social services. But the elections were seen as having national significance since the results are likely to influence the climate ahead of the 2017 presidential election.The outcome was a comeback for former President Nicolas Sarkozy and a clear defeat for the governing Socialists, who lost control of about half of the departments they had led, including Corr\u00e8ze, the base of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.While the far-right National Front party, led by Marine Le Pen, had been predicted to make large strides and did win a number of seats in some areas, it did not win enough to take control of even one department, according to National Front leaders.In acknowledging defeat, Prime Minister Manuel Valls, a Socialist who had campaigned hard to rally left-leaning voters, said his party had heard voters\u2019 anger and frustration and would respond with a focus on \u201cjobs, jobs, jobs.\u201dHe lamented that the left had been divided rather than combining into a coalition as several conservative parties did.Mr. Valls also warned that the number of votes garnered by the National Front, which has embraced a strongly anti-immigrant and anti-European Union position, \u201cindicates a lasting change in our political landscape from which we will each have to draw our own conclusions.\u201d For Mr. Sarkozy, who lost the presidency to Mr. Hollande in 2012, Sunday\u2019s vote was a victorious one that seemed to bring him one step closer to making another run. Last year he became the leader of a conservative party, the Union for a Popular Movement, but even before that he was weighing a return to politics. Mr. Sarkozy, looking determined and focused as the results came in, emphasized the voters\u2019 apparent rejection of Mr. Hollande\u2019s government, saying that there had never been such a complete disavowal at the polls of a sitting government.France\u2019s turn to the right was presaged by the first round of local elections on March 22, in which a mainstream right-leaning coalition led by Mr. Sarkozy garnered 29 percent of the popular vote while the Socialist Party won barely 22 percent. In both rounds only about half of eligible voters cast a ballot.The moribund French economy casts a long shadow over the electorate here, and the extended period of high unemployment hits especially hard on young people. Despite some small economic improvements \u2014 most recently a slight drop in the deficit \u2014 unemployment remains around 10 percent, according to Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s data arm. Much of the political discussion at the national level occurs with an eye to the next presidential elections, and both Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Le Pen of the National Front as well as Mr. Hollande are positioning themselves to run. They will have another chance to gauge their popularity and that of their parties in December when there will be regional elections.Though her party did not win control of any department in the elections, Ms. Le Pen tried to take the long view, based on the assumption that her party would at least capture more council seats than in past ballots.\u201cThis is the base for the great victories of tomorrow,\u201d she said.The vote Sunday was, to some extent, a test of the popularity of the National Front, which was in a strong position in this second round in hundreds of districts. However, both Mr. Valls on behalf of the Socialists and the conservative coalition led by Mr. Sarkozy urged people not to vote for the extreme right.Laure Fourquet contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hotels for the Next Generation", "Date": "2015-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayLonging for alternatives to the conventional, cookie-cutter hotel? Along with crocuses and daffodils, new specialty chains from major hospitality companies including Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt and Carlson Rezidor will be springing up across the globe in the coming weeks and months.The hotels are what\u2019s known in the industry as \u201clifestyle\u201d brands: They strive to appeal to the predilections of next-generation travelers. Some are trying to lure millennials (who are defined as between 18 and 34 in 2015, according to the Pew Research Center)) with high-tech lounges, reasonable rates, locally inspired amenities, and grab-and-go meals. Others are aiming to attract cosmopolitan travelers who simply want affordable, modern spaces that feel luxurious without being fussy or sterile.Here\u2019s a primer on what to expect if you step inside.\u201cIt\u2019s just like home, but with a bartender,\u201d explains the brand\u2019s website to the uninitiated. To the right, there\u2019s a slide show with a photograph of a blond woman in diminutive jean shorts and a cropped jacket, head cocked and eyes closed, suggesting she\u2019s rocking out to music streaming through her headphones. This is Marriott for Millennials, a demographic Marriott International felt was being underserved by its competitors with staid hotels that lacked personality. Much of what one will find inside Moxy, which is being rolled out in the United States after being introduced in Milan in September, is based on Marriott\u2019s research into millennial behavior, according to Tina Edmundson, the global officer for luxury and lifestyle brands for Marriott International. For instance, the company\u2019s research suggested that millennials shy away from hotels that feel corporate; they\u2019re immersed in social media; and they enjoy shared spaces for both work and fun. So Moxy hotels have playful \u201cliving rooms\u201d with free Wi-Fi, plenty of electrical outlets and classic games sized for giants, such as Jenga and Connect Four.Moxy is designed to compete with more traditional economy hotels \u2014 after all, millennials aren\u2019t necessarily flush \u2014 by offering affordable prices along with sleek, industrial-inspired design (polished concrete floors, exposed columns), comfort and a lively scene (ergo the bar).Each hotel in this chain, which will begin operating late this year, will aim to convey the feeling of the neighborhood it\u2019s in through locally inspired design, art, music, drinks (like evening tastings of local brews) and food. Guests may be shown neighborhood fitness options such as jogging routes and bikes, and they\u2019ll receive a small welcome gift from local businesses. Guests in Denver, for example, might be given a treat from the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, while those in Chicago might receive a snack from Garrett Popcorn.At check-in (which can be done through a mobile app) guests will have the option of selecting a themed \u201cfoodie bag\u201d for their minibar \u2014 \u201cone of the most underused amenities in hotel rooms,\u201d according to Gary Steffen, the global head of Canopy by Hilton. The foodie bag details are still being finalized, but Mr. Steffen said in an email that the options could include a \u201chealth driven\u201d bag, a \u201cchocolate lovers\u201d bag and a \u201cjet-lag\u201d bag.It\u2019s all part of Canopy\u2019s effort to cut through the clutter of so-called lifestyle hotels and offer a simple yet modern take on comfort and value. Speaking of the latter, breakfast will be free, and so will the Wi-Fi.This new brand is designed for what Hyatt calls \u201cmodern explorers\u201d: multigenerational, sophisticated travelers who want to be in the heart of their destinations and who want their hotel to be connected to the local culture.To that end there will be locally made amenities and bath wear; a common lounge for work or play called the Corner will have local books and magazines. As with some of the new hotels designed for millennials, there\u2019s free Wi-Fi, and dining is a more casual affair. For example, room service will be offered as a \u201cknock \u2018n\u2019 drop\u201d service; gone is the formal in-room, on-the-bed presentation.Another brand geared to millennials, this upscale line from Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group \u2014 the owners of chains including Radisson, Radisson Blu, and Country Inns & Suites by Carlson \u2014 is making its debut this year. As with other properties that are courting the next generation, the emphasis is on technology, modern design and quick food service (expect a bar and deli instead of a full-service restaurant).A mobile app will allow you to do everything from skipping the check-in desk to ordering a drink from the bar to requesting flowers through an online concierge and summoning a taxi to whisk you to the airport. When you arrive you enter a \u201cgallery\u201d art space, which flows into a bar and deli area open from morning coffee to evening cocktails.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Fed in 2009, Rolling the Dice in a Crisis", "Date": "2015-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameBen Bernanke and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board have earned accolades from all corners for the extraordinary actions they took to rescue the financial system in 2009. While 2008 was the Fed\u2019s annus horribilis, exposing how unaware the central bank had been of the risks building in the financial system, 2009 was its year of redemption.So it was interesting, last week, to read the newly released transcripts from Federal Reserve Board meetings in 2009, which include some of the darkest days of the mess. With the economy now on a sound footing and the stock market near a record high, the decisions made by the Fed to shore up credit markets in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis look even better. There were two basic camps within the Fed. On one side were the reserve bank presidents who wanted to throw anything and everything at the crisis. For the most part, these officials came from regions \u2014 like New York and Boston \u2014 that are home to big financial firms. They contended that the financial system was in such peril that big substantive action had to be taken, pronto.On the other side were those who hoped to weigh the trillion-dollar programs \u2014 separately and together \u2014 to make sure their costs and risks didn\u2019t exceed their benefits. Many holding this view were from regions with more diverse economies, like Kansas City and Dallas.\u201cThis last discussion has been fascinating against the backdrop of our not having a clear sense of exactly why and how expanding our balance sheet affects the world,\u201d said Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., at an April 2009 meeting. \u201cI think we\u2019re really groping in the dark here. I think we need to recognize that.\u201dMr. Lacker and others who raised questions about the potential costs and benefits of the 2009 programs had good reason to. As the new transcripts indicate, their concerns were at least in part intended to protect the larger economy from the perils of rescuing reckless market participants. Consider the discussions surrounding something with a mouthful of a name \u2014 the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, also known as TALF. Operated by the New York Fed, it was put in place in late November 2008 and allowed borrowers to receive loans for up to five years in exchange for asset-backed securities they held. For the securities to be eligible for exchange, they had to be newly issued and rated AAA. The program would have allowed up to $200 billion in loans. The idea behind it was to open the credit spigot for businesses and consumers \u2014 making it easier to provide car loans, for instance \u2014 and jump-start the moribund asset-backed securities market. By limiting eligible securities to those that were newly issued and highly rated, the Fed hoped to limit the risks associated with lending against questionable assets. But the TALF program later became riskier. The Treasury proposed loosening the TALF program\u2019s asset eligibility requirements to include so-called legacy securities. This was a euphemism for asset-backed instruments created during the boom that had become toxic. In the early months of that year, the Fed pressed ahead with the bold measures it had initiated in 2008 to arrest the financial crisis. By summer it had largely succeeded.Why open up the program to such risks? Providing a market for such securities would propel their prices, Fed staff argued, and bolster bank balance sheets.In 2009, of course, the Fed was under significant pressure from financiers to save their institutions and the markets. It also had to hold the line against the United States Treasury, which was pushing it to accelerate its efforts. Five regional Fed presidents balked. \u201cI would stay away from legacy TALF,\u201d said Gary H. Stern, then president of the Minneapolis Fed. \u201cFunding the bad bank is a close cousin to being the bad bank.\u201d Other objections came from Richard W. Fisher, the Dallas Fed president; Thomas M. Hoenig, then head of the Kansas City Fed; Charles I. Plosser of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank; and Janet L. Yellen, then president of the San Francisco Fed and now the chairwoman of the Board of Governors.The criticisms went nowhere. In May 2010, the Federal Reserve announced that it would accept legacy securities backed by commercial mortgages.The TALF program emerges in the transcripts as a sticking point for those at the Fed who objected to the ad hoc nature of the rescues. These people, quite rationally, wanted a cost-benefit analysis of the proposals to ensure they would generate real results while limiting downside exposure.\u201cWhat\u2019s not clear to me is whether we have the right set of metrics to help us judge how much expansion we need and what the right trade-offs are as we do it,\u201d said Mr. Plosser at the March meeting, referring to balance sheet growth. (That was the meeting at which the Fed staff proposed expanding TALF.) \u201cIt seems to me that we do these various programs on almost a one-off basis. I think one of the challenges we face is getting some grasp of how these programs are benefiting us at the margin.\u201dIt took a few more months for the program to start running on all cylinders, but by then, the economy and the stock market had begun showing signs of life. Perhaps because of those improvements, the facility never ballooned in size. So did the program work? On the surface, it looks like a money generator, having reaped $746 million in fees and income. The New York Fed kept 10 percent of that and sent the rest to the Treasury. But those returns are not adjusted for the risk that the Fed took by being willing to bring dubious securities onto its balance sheet and the true costs of lending money against them. How effective was it? Obviously, in the 2008 crisis, the Federal Reserve was operating without a guidebook. And there wasn\u2019t much time to do the kinds of cost-benefit analyses of liquidity programs that some in the Fed wanted. Still, if these transcripts show us anything, it\u2019s that regulators should be armed with precisely these kinds of assessments. And well before the next financial panic ensues. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flurry of Freight Spurs New Commercial Building Construction in Georgia", "Date": "2015-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetGARDEN CITY, Ga. \u2014 The business of marine transport here at the nation\u2019s fourth-largest container port is a study in numbers.Thirty-one oceangoing container vessels berth at the nearly 10,000-foot-long Garden City terminal each week. More than 8,000 trucks arrive and depart from the terminal daily. Garden City handled 3.3 million 20-foot containers last year, over 10 percent more container cargo than in 2013, and a record.There are other numbers that are just as vital to this growing business, but not nearly so visible. Hidden behind the green curtain of Georgia pine forest that surrounds the terminal are 45.3 million square feet of logistics, storage and distribution centers, according to the Georgia Ports Authority, the terminal\u2019s owner and operator.\u201cThe link between the terminal and the distribution centers is essential to our operations,\u201d said Curtis J. Foltz, executive director of the Georgia Ports Authority. \u201cOur competitiveness is based on efficiency and connectivity, making sure products don\u2019t sit around. The real estate developments are a partnership that makes expanding trade here possible.\u201dGarden City\u2019s traffic, which includes everything from containers of frozen Georgia chicken parts heading to Asia and stuffed doggy beds coming in from China, is about evenly divided between exports and imports.The largest distribution center is the 2.5-million-square-foot facility owned by Schneider Logistics, a unit of the national trucking company. Walmart operates a two-million-square-foot center in Statesboro, 55 miles west. Both are expansive enough to completely enclose two typical suburban shopping malls, or all the businesses in Savannah\u2019s historic downtown, which lies just downstream.Other large forested parcels near Savannah will be used to build more distribution warehouses. OA Logistics/JLA Home, a subsidiary of the privately held California-based E&E Company, announced plans in January to build a 1.1-million square-foot e-commerce fulfillment center near the port.Hundreds of miles away, construction of other distribution centers has been influenced by the port, according to the Georgia Department of Economic Development. Last year, Bed Bath & Beyond opened a $50 million, 810,000-square-foot distribution center in Jefferson, northeast of Atlanta and 230 miles away. Walmart is constructing a $102 million, 1.2-million-square-foot distribution facility in Union City, south of Atlanta and 250 miles from the Savannah port.Demand for new warehouse and distribution space is intensifying, said John F. Petrino, director of business development for the Georgia Ports Authority. Vacancy rates, which were as high as 18.6 percent in 2009, dropped to 5.4 percent last year, according to the port. That occurred even as 11 new or expanded distribution centers, enclosing more than three million square feet, opened last year in or near Garden City, the Ports Authority said, accounting for 1,950 new jobs.\u201cThe economy is recovering and you see that in the amount of freight moving through these buildings,\u201d Mr. Petrino said.Anticipating the growth in canal traffic, the state of Georgia and its Ports Authority spent a decade and $758 million to improve highways, purchase new cranes, improve rail connections and reconstruct the terminal ramps and traffic patterns to compete. A dredging contract was signed this month as part of a $706 million state and federal project to expand the port and deepen the Savannah River.Georgia\u2019s share, $266 million, was approved by the legislature. Congress authorized the federal share in a water bill last June. President Obama requested $42 million for the project in this year\u2019s budget proposal. Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia, a Republican, has repeatedly told reporters that he is confident Congress will approve the request.Such fiscal transactions, largely distanced from public attention, are characteristic of the operations at the logistics and distribution centers here. Unlike the container terminal, with its enormous ships coming and going, and its trucks and cranes operating with almost antic urgency, the immense distribution centers aren\u2019t visible at all.It takes a veteran guide like Mr. Petrino to navigate the building sites, which generally range from 50 to 100 acres, and are hidden by deep screens of mature pines. Encountering a million-square-foot facility, half a mile long and 400 yards wide, is like emerging from a dark locker room tunnel to confront towering tiers of stands in an N.F.L. stadium.Companies are leery about opening the interior of their buildings to public view, which Mr. Petrino attributed partly to the proprietary nature of some of the newer equipment used to move and ship products. Even the systems for storing freight and organizational warehousing techniques are tightly held, a reflection of slim profit margins and steep competition.Rodney Dickey, the president of OA Logistics and chief operating officer of JLA Home, noted these features of the business while walking through the company\u2019s 679,000-square-foot distribution center. Electric and propane-fueled forklifts whirred through the building, which is longer than a five-stroke golf hole, has a 32-foot ceiling and smells like new cardboard.A portion of the building contains a printing shop for art sold by the import company. Another part is an area for Chinese-made products that require final assembly and packaging. One hundred and ten people work in the 11-year-old building, housed on 41 acres, which the company bought in 2009 for $28 million.A new distribution center costs $42 to $55 per square foot to build, plus the price of the land and infrastructure like utility installations, which is usually more than $100,000 an acre, Mr. Dickey said.OA Logistics and its parent company are expanding so quickly that planning for a second new building has started. \u201cWe\u2019ll need another million square feet,\u201d Mr. Dickey said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking five years ahead. These centers take 16 months to build so we have to start thinking about it now.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article rendered incorrectly part of the name of a company that plans to build a fulfillment center near the port. As noted correctly in the article, it is OA Logistics, not AO Logistics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Judge Refuses to Lift Injunction on Argentine Bond Payments", "Date": "2015-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA New York judge at the center of a multiyear battle between Argentina and a group a hedge funds has dug in his heels once again.On Thursday, Judge Thomas P. Griesa of the Federal District Court in Manhattan rejected an appeal by Citigroup to lift an injunction that prevents the bank from making interest payments to investors holding $2.3 billion of Argentine bonds.Judge Griesa\u2019s decision \u2014 the latest in a legal battle that has played out in the New York courts \u2014 is a stinging defeat for Citigroup, its clients and Argentina.For Citigroup, the decision pits the bank against Argentina once again, placing it in a situation that it has compared to having a gun held to its head. The bank\u2019s lawyers have argued that it faces \u201cgrave sanctions\u201d from Argentina and could lose its banking license if it is not allowed to make the interest payments.For Argentina, the decision dashes any hope the debt-ridden country has of finding a new source of funding in the international markets.The most recent ruling stems from a decision by Judge Griesa to block all interest payments on Argentine debt, a move that caused the country to default last summer and has locked Argentina out of the international debt markets ever since.The dispute traces its roots to 2001, when Argentina defaulted on nearly $100 billion of its bonds. Most of the investors holding government bonds exchanged them later for new, discounted ones. But a small group of hedge funds, led by Paul E. Singer\u2019s NML Capital, held on to their old bonds and instead took Argentina to court seeking full repayment.In a surprise victory for the so-called holdout hedge funds, Judge Griesa ruled that banks handling the bond payments could not pass Argentina\u2019s money to holders of the exchanged bonds without also paying the holdouts in full.But in a twist last September, Judge Griesa allowed Citigroup to make a one-time $5 million payment to a group of investors holding bonds issued under Argentine law. This ruling had raised hopes that it could pave the way for more leniency from the court.Until his ruling on Thursday, Judge Griesa had blocked Argentina from making payments on all government bonds issued under New York and English law, but he had yet to rule conclusively on the bonds issued under Argentine law.\u201cThe court\u2019s ruling makes clear that any third-party that attempts to help Argentina in the payment process is in violation of the court\u2019s injunction,\u201d a spokesman for NML Capital said.Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for Citigroup, said, \u201cCiti will pursue all legal measures available to comply both with this decision and Argentine legislation. In that regard, Citi will appeal the court\u2019s decision and has already requested the suspension of the injunction pending such appeal.\u201dThe chief press aide to Axel Kicillof, Argentina\u2019s economy minister, did not respond to an email asking for comment on the ruling. But speaking on Thursday in a northern Argentine province before news of the ruling broke, Mr Kicillof said, referring to the holdouts as vultures, \u201cWe have beaten the vulture funds, showing Argentines and the world that speculative investors \u2014 which seem omnipotent and which attack a nation\u2019s people \u2014 are not invincible.\u201dJonathan Gilbert contributed reporting from Buenos Aires.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Black Jobless Rates Remain High, but Fed Can Only Do So Much to Help", "Date": "2015-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncomes and OutcomesThe time-honored pattern of American economic cycles is that recessions are worse for black workers.As the recovery gains momentum, and the labor market starts to look more normal, a new report offers a reminder that black workers once again are lagging behind.The unemployment rate for black workers remains 1.3 percentage points higher than on the eve of the recession in December 2007, while for white workers it is 0.5 points higher.Black workers have also suffered twice as large a reduction in median hourly wages: down 3.6 percent for black workers; 1.7 percent for white workers.\u201cThe Federal Reserve needs to craft monetary policy that tightens the labor market sufficiently so that all Americans, and African-Americans in particular, have an opportunity to benefit from the shared prosperity that a full-employment economy provides,\u201d the two groups argue in the report, which presents unemployment and wage data for each of the Fed\u2019s 12 regions to put a local face on the problem.The black unemployment rate has remained roughly twice as high as the white unemployment rate through good times and bad times in recent decades. Black unemployment rose more quickly during the recession and it has fallen more quickly during the recovery, preserving that ratio going up and coming down. So black workers stand to benefit disproportionately.It\u2019s not obvious, however, that holding down borrowing costs for a little longer would be an effective way to address the underlying problem. Indeed, the problem is a good illustration of the limits of monetary policy.The magnitude of the differences varies widely among the states, but the lowest level of black unemployment in any state last year, the 8 percent rate in Virginia, was still higher than the highest rate of white unemployment in any state, the 7 percent rate in Nevada. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports black unemployment rates for only 28 of the states.)They are more likely to live in lower-income communities where jobs are harder to find. Living in these places may also make it harder for workers to obtain a good education, and easier to run afoul of law enforcement.As a result, the level of stimulus necessary to reduce excessive black unemployment may well be excessive for the economy as a whole.It is possible stronger growth would have even larger benefits for black workers, by eroding the importance of the various structural obstacles that have historically made it harder for them to find jobs. But other parts of the government, through fiscal and regulatory policies, have many more levers to address the problems of particular communities.The Fed has a hammer, and, as the saying goes, not all problems are nails.An earlier version of this article misstated the relative levels of unemployment decline among blacks and whites since the Great Recession. Since the recession, black unemployment has declined by a larger amount than white unemployment, not the reverse, and that pattern is likely to continue.Advertisement"}

And in case the message was not clear enough, after the vote, men paraded through the streets chanting, \u201cTell your father that Amari camp doesn\u2019t like you!\u201dMuch attention has focused recently on the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s apparent disavowal of a two-state solution and his shattered relationship with the Obama administration.\u201cYou need Palestinians to be unified and have a system that will allow them to become a Palestinian state,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo internal problems \u2014 like the split, and like the paralyzed political system, and a lack of elections \u2014 they are impediments also, for achieving the objective of independence and statehood.\u201dPalestinians note that Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank have expanded. East Jerusalem, which they hope to be the capital of a future state, is beyond their reach, and they are beholden to Israel for their prosperity. Years of negotiations with Israel for statehood have gone nowhere.Now, Palestinians are deep in an economic crisis because Israel withheld tax revenues for nearly three months, as a punishment for Palestinians\u2019 seeking to join the International Criminal Court (they will assume full membership in April). Israel announced Friday that it would release the withheld funds, apparently in an effort to appease the Obama administration after weeks of tensions, though it will continue to hold back tax revenue.\u201cThere\u2019s no change, but the settlements get bigger and people are tired \u2014 if they had a chance to change, they would,\u201d said Hassan, 27, at a two-chair falafel stall amid the crowded homes of the Amari refugee camp.\u201cPeople are being buried in starvation and unemployment,\u201d said Hassan, who requested that his family name not be used because he feared harassment by security services. He supports his seven brothers and sisters on $12 a day earned as a day laborer.Mr. Abbas is widely resented in Gaza, a territory he has not visited since Hamas drove out Fatah in 2007, in a bloody civil war that followed a failed unity government after Hamas\u2019s victory in the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections.The Israeli leader\u2019s settlement policy resembles his predecessors\u2019, but it is a march toward permanence at a time when prospects for peace are few.With deep resentments on both sides, they have been unable to negotiate a deal that would allow Mr. Abbas to take control of Gaza\u2019s border crossings, which would ease a blockade by Egypt and Israel. Most frustrating for many Palestinians is that there is international support for such a move, making it appear, more than ever, that their leaders care little for their welfare.Instead, Mr. Abbas sent his prime minister, Rami Hamdallah, to Gaza last week, although little was expected of his meetings with Hamas officials.Neither Hamas nor Mr. Abbas show interest in elections, paralyzing the Palestinian parliamentary and legislative system. The government that sprang from the reconciliation pact they signed last April has achieved little.Mr. Abbas refuses to pay Hamas-appointed government workers in Gaza, fostering resentment. Hamas officials are resisting handing over military control to Mr. Abbas\u2019s forces.Yet Mr. Abbas is also somewhat hamstrung. Reconciling with Hamas, whose charter calls for Israel\u2019s destruction, could lead to crushing international isolation in an economy dependent on foreign aid.European diplomats have offered a solution in which Mr. Abbas would have the leading hand in a unity government. But a direct role for Hamas, which the United States deems a terrorist organization, would risk the $400 million Washington provides the Palestinian Authority annually.In the West Bank, Mr. Abbas was once praised for establishing security, cracking down on gunmen who terrorized Palestinian communities devastated by years of violence and Israeli closures. He also crushed Hamas in the West Bank, helped by coordinating security with Israel.On the eve of the recent Israeli election, the prime minister said that no Palestinian state would be created on his watch. Two days later, he began to backtrack.Palestinians say that Mr. Abbas has little else to show for his efforts, and that he is trying to ensure that no other leaders can emerge in his stead.In particular, he is trying to crush the ambitions of his one-time ally, Muhammad Dahlan. The wealthy Gaza strongman, once a feared security chief, commands loyalty in Gaza, and appears to be building a following in the West Bank.Over the past two years, Mr. Abbas\u2019s Palestinian Authority has put Mr. Dahlan on trial in absentia for corruption. He was sentenced to two years in jail for defamation \u2014 effectively barring him from running in elections \u2014 and he was expelled from the ruling body in Fatah, the political party that Mr. Abbas heads.Mr. Abbas has also moved against Salam Fayyad, a former prime minister: In August, Mr. Abbas\u2019s security forces questioned employees of an organization led by Mr. Fayyad, in what was widely seen as an attempt to intimidate him.A small incident in Amari on March 20, which lies just miles from Ramallah, the gleaming political center of the West Bank, underscored the gathering fury against Mr. Abbas and the system he heads.After Mr. Tumaileh\u2019s victory, men chanted in the streets and women ululated from balconies. \u201cIt was a defeat for Mahmoud Abbas,\u201d Abu Mohammed, the former teacher, said.While many Palestinians acknowledge their system is broken, they worry that it is being used as an excuse by Israel and other countries to allow their statehood hopes to wither.\u201cIt is always demanded of Palestinians to give a guarantee so they can have a state,\u201d said Sabri Saydam, a former adviser to Mr. Abbas. \u201cNo matter what we do, there will always be pretexts.\u201dSaid Ghazali contributed reporting from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taxes Take Away, but Also Give Back, Mostly to the Very Rich", "Date": "2015-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cGet your billions back, America,\u201d the tax preparer H&R Block urges in television advertisements.What many taxpayers may not realize is that they already do. When it comes to the government, taxing is often just another name for spending.There are tax credits and tax deductions; tax exclusions and tax exemptions; tax deferrals and tax reductions; tax discharges and tax preferences, all of which put money in people\u2019s wallets rather than take it out.\u201cEvery year, the federal government spends billions of dollars on these tax programs primarily to support the highest-income households that need support the least,\u201d said Ezra Levin, associate director of government affairs for the group, which is based in Washington.Relentless pressure in recent years, particularly by conservatives, to reduce program spending has meant that the tax code has increasingly become the primary driver of social policy when it comes to education, retirement and housing.The amount of spending in those areas channeled through taxes is on the rise, topping $620 billion in 2014, up from $540 billion in 2013, according to Mr. Levin\u2019s analysis. By comparison, federal discretionary spending by 14 of the 15 cabinet agencies, including housing, transportation, labor, commerce, education, Treasury and health and human services totaled $464 billion.\u201cThis is not a liberal position or a conservative position,\u201d he said.Those at the tippy-top of the income scale \u2014 the top 0.1 percent, with an average annual income of $7.6 million \u2014 received an average of $33,391 in federal tax payouts analyzed by the group. Those in the bottom 60 percent, who earn less than $65,000, got less than $1,000 on average, altogether about 12 percent of the billions handed out.Other benefits similarly help largely upper-income families. The deduction for mortgage interest payments, one of the oldest and largest, and the one for property taxes together cost the federal government $98.5 billion in 2014. About 70 percent of the benefits went to the top quintile of earners. The average gain for a household in the bottom 20 percent \u2014 those earning less than $21,000 a year \u2014 amounted to $3, according to the enterprise development group.Retirement tax spending, totaling $146 billion in 2014, up from $128 billion from the previous year, also primarily benefits high-income households. The average annual benefit for the 1 percenters in 2013 equaled $13,088, compared with $200 or less for the bottom 60 percent, the development group found.Tax programs that do help those with less include the earned-income tax credit, a wage subsidy that increases the incomes of 27 million low-wage workers. Many economists and advocates consider it the most effective antipoverty measure around. The savers credit, which helps low- and moderate-income families build retirement savings, is also geared toward those with fewer resources.In his 2016 budget, President Obama proposed bulking up these programs, including a $500 tax credit for working parents with children. The White House estimated that the maximum credit would help those earning below $120,000, with some money funneled to households with incomes up to $210,000.Tax policy tends to benefit those in the upper tier of the income ladder for several reasons. Wealthier households fall into higher income brackets, and so they get proportionately greater savings. They also have more assets to put into housing, retirement accounts and educational programs that are eligible for tax subsidies.Many economists have noted that from an accountant\u2019s point of view, there is no difference between spending through the tax code and the budget. The minimum-wage worker who uses a federal voucher to help pay the rent and the Wall Street banker who deducts the mortgage interest on a multimillion-dollar vacation getaway in the Hamptons are both the recipients of government housing assistance.Congress started including what are known as tax expenditures in federal spending totals in 1976 as part of a budget reform package.She advocates providing receipts that detail just how much money someone receives through the tax code, a counterpart to the W-2s and other notices that list what someone pays.That way everyone would know just who is getting their billions back.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anemic Support Greets Potential Olympic Bid in Boston", "Date": "2015-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 Public support for Boston to host the 2024 Summer Olympics was already on the downslope, but it has plunged even further in the last month.Only 36 percent of adults in the Boston region support hosting the Games, while 52 percent oppose doing so, according to the latest poll for WBUR, Boston\u2019s NPR radio station. This is among the most anemic levels of support ever registered by a potential host city at this stage in the process and could doom the bid unless it is reversed. Public opinion will play an important role when the International Olympic Committee selects its choice in 2017 from an array of cities that is likely to include Paris; Rome; Hamburg, Germany; Istanbul; and Doha, Qatar.Now, the numbers have dropped to the opposite of where the public started in January.The United States Olympic Committee responded to the poll Thursday. Scott Blackmun, the committee\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement Thursday that \u201cit\u2019s still early in the process, and while we would be pleased to see full support across the board, we recognize that it will take time and effort to successfully answer the important questions being raised by Bostonians.\u201dThe decline in support coincides with a brutal winter in which Boston\u2019s regional transit system, a linchpin in the proposed bid, collapsed as a record amount of snow fell on the city.\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what we would see this time,\u201d said Steve Koczela, the pollster for the MassINC Polling Group, which conducted the survey for WBUR. \u201cOne theory was that after February, once the snow melted and the trains revved back to life, you\u2019d see support bounce back, that those numbers just reflected the winter grumpiness,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that hasn\u2019t happened.\u201dThat suggested that winter, or winter alone, was not to blame.\u201cPeople have learned more about it and like it less,\u201d he said of the bid. Chief among the concerns is that taxpayers will end up being saddled with overrun costs.Only 29 percent of the poll\u2019s respondents believed the promise that the Games would be paid for with private money, while 65 percent said taxpayers would end up footing the bill.And they have a negative view of Boston2024, the group of business leaders, construction magnates and public officials who organized the bid. It has been criticized for failing to be transparent, announcing venues that were not verified with landlords, and paying officials extravagant salaries: Deval L. Patrick, the former governor, is to be paid $7,500 a day for his work as a \u201cglobal ambassador\u201d for the bid.After the WBUR poll became public Thursday, Patrick said in a statement that he would continue to promote the Olympics but would not take a fee. \u201cI intend to take a full-time position soon and to forgo all outside consulting pay, including for Boston2024,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I think the Olympics could be good for the Commonwealth, I will continue to help as and when I can, but not for a fee.\u201dOnly 19 percent of respondents said they had a favorable view of Boston2024, while 34 percent said they had a favorable view of NoBostonOlympics, the chief opposition group.Doug Rubin, a spokesman for Boston2024, said the committee knew it had work to do. But he added that as the committee gets feedback and is able to explain its ideas and goals, the bid is \u201cgaining traction.\u201dHe said the plan was still fluid. \u201cIt will take six or nine months of working this through, but fairly soon we will come back with modifications to the plan, and people will say, \u2018Hey, they listened to us,\u2019\u00a0\u201c he said. He declined to specify any venue changes. \u201cWe want to avoid some of the mistakes we made early, and if we announce alternative venues, we want to make sure there\u2019s significant community input beforehand,\u201d he said.He also anticipated that support would grow.\u201cWe are going to continue to talk with people every day, solicit their input and advice and try to answer their questions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when we do, we are confident that people will support an Olympic bid.\u201dIn the group\u2019s favor, the first detailed independent study of the bid, released Wednesday by the Boston Foundation and conducted by the University of Massachusetts Donahue Institute, said that hosting the Games would pump billions of dollars into the economy and create 54,000 temporary jobs; related construction would create more than 4,000 jobs a year from 2018 to 2023. But it also warned of the need to check potential cost overruns.The International Olympic Committee will conduct its own official polling starting in January 2017. One consultant who has been involved in three successful Olympic bids hewed to the notion that this poll reflected negativity brought on by winter and represented the nadir of public opinion.The consultant, who spoke anonymously because of his sensitive position, predicted the numbers would climb as spring blossomed. But he also said it was important for Boston2024 to settle on a strategic campaign and begin to execute it.\u201cNo one should be pressing the panic button yet,\u201d he said. \u201cNorth America is a discerning place, and I doubt you could ever see support over 70 percent because there will always be a hard core that is opposed.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cBoston needs to start getting its act together.\u201d The WBUR poll interviewed 504 registered voters from March 16 to 18 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Reality of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:I treated chronic fatigue syndrome patients in my family medicine outpatient practice for several years. They were easily identified, actually, from all the other illnesses that cause fatigue. You just had to have an interest and look for it.Patients were remarkably grateful for a diagnosis even if treatments were ineffective over all, and the best advice was to moderate activity, since overexertion could certainly worsen the illness. Many of my patients improved over the years and were grateful to have someone who believed in them.My question to those docs who disparage the notion that the disease is real: What if you\u2019re wrong? What about \u201cFirst, do no harm\u201d? Aren\u2019t denial and neglect of a patient\u2019s experience and symptoms an easy way to harm patients?This is a real disease that begs for more research money. The recent interest by the Institute of Medicine is a good start after more than 35 years in the shadows.Julie Rehmeyer\u2019s article documented the serious and devastating nature of chronic fatigue syndrome. But it may have several etiologies, some unknown and some caused by known illnesses like adrenal insufficiency, pernicious anemia, occult neoplasms (hidden tumors) and major depression, to name a few.Therefore, until more specific tests can be established, a careful medical evaluation to rule out other causes of chronic fatigue syndrome is necessary. Even then, the diagnosis should be a working diagnosis, subject to amendment when new medical data is obtained.The writer is an internist and endocrinologist. Now that the prestigious Institute of Medicine has examined the illness known as chronic fatigue syndrome and unambiguously declared it to be \u201ca serious, chronic, complex, systemic disease\u201d that is \u201creal,\u201d there can be no excuses.No excuses from our country\u2019s health agencies, which have failed to fund research at a level commensurate with the economic burden it places on our economy. And no excuses from anyone \u2014 doctors, friends, co-workers or family \u2014 who dismisses the devastating suffering of a million or more of our fellow Americans.This definitive I.O.M. report declared that we must commit to funding research to eradicate this disease. We have an opportunity to be on the right side of history.In \u201cA Disease Doctors Refuse to See,\u201d Julie Rehmeyer highlights the challenge in persuading the medical and scientific community of the evidence behind chronic fatigue syndrome. If there\u2019s no objective test to prove it, the conventional argument goes, then it must not be \u201creal.\u201dAs a graduating medical student, I can empathize with Ms. Rehmeyer\u2019s frustration. Doctors in training are hard-wired from the very beginning of medical school to believe only that which can be confirmed by some diagnostic test or lab result. We are programmed to feel uncomfortable with clinical ambiguity and uncertainty.But perhaps we are committing a great disservice to ourselves \u2014 and most of all, to our patients \u2014 by dismissing real patient concerns in our search for more and more \u201creal\u201d objective tests.The writer is a fourth-year student at the University of Vermont College of Medicine.As someone who has suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome for five years and who has had his life turned upside down as a result, I welcome the report of the Institute of Medicine, which sheds light on the seriousness of the disease and urges doctors to stop accusing patients with symptoms of having psychological problems.It is past time that doctors, as well as friends and relatives of people who have this disease, understand, as the article states, that what we experience \u201cis so much more\u201d than normal fatigue.While the proposed name change may have the beneficial effect of making some people in the medical community sit up and take notice of the disease, the new name is certainly not something that will roll off the tongue of patients, as in \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t go to the ballgame today because I have systemic exertion intolerance disease.\u201dThe truth of the matter is, to paraphrase Shakespeare, a debilitating disease is a debilitating disease by any other name. What is desperately needed is funding to find a cause and a cure. If that ever happens, they can call it anything they want!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Seventh Day,\u2019 by Yu Hua", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In Yu Hua\u2019s surreal, mordant novel \u201cThe Seventh Day,\u201d the victims of China\u2019s \u00adexplosively expanding market economy include the still conscious, still suffering, still impoverished dead. They can\u2019t afford burial plots. They\u2019ve been separated from their families and uprooted from their \u00adancestral homes. Unable to be mourned in the proper Chinese way, they\u2019re fated to roam a \u201chazy, indistinct city\u201d where snow swirls around their legs and they have the opportunity to reflect upon their lives and the circumstances of their deaths. The limping shades may then encounter the dead former friends and loved ones who also inhabit this characteristically \u00adChinese mega-necropolis.Yu is the internationally celebrated \u00adauthor of \u201cTo Live\u201d (which was made into a well-regarded 1994 film) as well as the epic satirical novel \u201cBrothers,\u201d which \u00adappeared in an English translation in 2009. In 2011, his collection of linked \u00adpersonal essays, \u201cChina in Ten Words,\u201d recalled the Cultural Revolution and the 1989 \u00addemocracy movement that met its violent end in Tiananmen Square, the historical memories of which have been all but suppressed by a modernizing nation lost in a frenzy of getting and spending. In \u201cThe Seventh Day,\u201d he amplifies his critique of contemporary Chinese society, especially government corruption and his country\u2019s headlong \u00adaffair with consumerism. The novel opens with Yang Fei, a poor, freshly deceased tutor, late for his \u00adappointment at the local crematorium. There\u2019s heavy traffic, and the 203 bus isn\u2019t running. When he finally makes it to the facility, he discovers that the \u00adinequalities that separate the living continue to \u00addivide the dead. The V.I.P.s have their own \u00adwaiting area, with comfy armchairs. Newly dead officials boast of burial plots that await them on mountain peaks with ocean views. Their \u201corganic headstones\u201d have already been ordered. Realizing that he doesn\u2019t have adequate funerary garments or even an urn, Yang Fei declines to \u00adanswer when his number is called. \u00adInstead, he leaves the crematorium. On a journey of post-mortem discovery, he is eventually reunited with his beloved \u00adfather and reconciles with his ex-wife, who has just committed suicide.In Yang Fei\u2019s limbo walk, the dead \u00adoffer lurid accounts of corruption, police \u00adviolence, political repression and the demolition of homes with their residents still inside, along with tales of the day-to-day mistreatment suffered by ordinary Chinese at the hands of the powerful and the wealthy. Some of these stories, which read as if they had been drawn from the country\u2019s sensationalist press, provide occasions for broad satire \u2014 as when a cross-dressing prostitute steals into a police station to attack the cop who arrested and tortured him. The policemen defend their failure to protect a colleague: \u201cPeople who arrive at the public security bureau with backpacks are normally there to deliver bribes. .\u2008.\u2008. Who could have known that this guy would pull out a knife?\u201d\u201cThe Seventh Day\u201d contains many \u00adinstances of macabre comedy, though Allan H. Barr\u2019s workmanlike translation is too wordy to deliver its best potential laugh lines. Here pathos rules. Yang Fei\u2019s life, which begins in the toilet of a railway train and ends in a restaurant fire, has not been any easier than those of the \u00adother dead. His relationship with his \u00adfather, marked by mutual self-sacrifice, left both men going to their deaths in tragic \u00adisolation.The conditions that regulate the \u00adnovel\u2019s troubled afterlife, requiring the \u00adunmourned to wander the netherworld, reflect a particularly Chinese concern about remembering and honoring one\u2019s lost family members and ancestors. In \u201cThe Seventh Day,\u201d a materialistic, greedy, increasingly impersonal society has made these obligations difficult, if not impossible, to fulfill. For many, this \u00adfantasy may be Yu\u2019s most devastating critique of the new Chinese reality. THE SEVENTH DAYBy Yu HuaTranslated by Allan H.

{"Headline": "Ways to Put the Boss\u2019s Skin in the Game", "Date": "2015-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameLife is not fair, I know, but this is getting ridiculous.Whenever a big corporation settles an enforcement matter with prosecutors, penalties levied in the case \u2014 and they can be enormous \u2014 are usually paid by the company\u2019s shareholders. Yet the people who actually did the deeds or oversaw the operations rarely so much as open their wallets.Economists have a name for this sort of thing: It\u2019s called a perverse incentive. Essentially, company executives and other major players are encouraged to take outsize risks because they can earn princely amounts from their actions. At the same time, they know that they rarely have to pay any fines or face other costly consequences from taking dangerous actions.Changing this troubling dynamic won\u2019t be easy. But it is the goal of two new proposals worth consideration. One will be put to a vote of Citigroup shareholders at the bank\u2019s annual meeting this year. Let\u2019s take up the Citigroup proposal first. It would require that top executives at the company contribute a substantial portion of their compensation each year to a pool of money that would be available to pay penalties if legal violations were uncovered at the bank. To ensure that the money would be available for a long enough period \u2014 investigations into wrongdoing take years to develop \u2014 the proposal would require that the executives keep their pay in the pool for 10 years.The proposal would also require that Citigroup advise shareholders of forfeitures that resulted under the program. And the money could be tapped even if the executives contributing to it were not responsible for the wrongdoing.\u201cBank managers are paid to keep a bank compliant with the law,\u201d Mr. Naylor said in an interview last week. \u201cWhen the bank is not compliant, those managers should be held accountable. Docking their paycheck is one way to do that.\u201d\u201cCiti employees committed these unlawful acts,\u201d Mr. Naylor wrote in a statement supporting the proposal. \u201cThey did not contribute to this penalty payment, but instead undoubtedly received bonuses.\u201dCitigroup, not surprisingly, asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to exclude the policy from its 2015 shareholder proxy. The S.E.C. said no, and Citi\u2019s shareholders will vote on the proposal when they meet on April 28.The proposal is nonbinding; Citigroup need not abide by its terms even if a majority of shareholders favor it. Citi has urged shareholders to reject the proposal, saying that its current policies do the job and that the terms of Mr. Naylor\u2019s proposal would put the bank at a disadvantage to its peers. But if broad support for the proposal emerges, Citi might throw in the towel.The proposal has additional heft, Mr. Naylor said, because William Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has publicly suggested a similar approach. In a speech in October, he described the benefits of a so-called performance bond to be issued to bank executives.\u201cIn the case of a large fine, the senior management and the material risk takers would forfeit their performance bond,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. \u201cNot only would this deferred debt compensation discipline individual behavior and decision-making, but it would provide strong incentives for individuals to flag issues when problems develop.\u201dAnother way to overcome this type of perverse incentive is a proposal by Greg Zipes, a trial lawyer for the Office of the United States Trustee, the nation\u2019s watchdog over the bankruptcy system, who also teaches at the New York University School for Professional Studies. In the article, Mr. Zipes calls for the creation of a contract to be signed by a company\u2019s top executives that could be enforced after a significant corporate governance failure. Executives would agree to pay back 25 percent of their gross compensation for the three years before the beginning of improprieties. The agreement would be in effect whether or not the executives knew about the misdeeds inside their companies.It\u2019s only fitting for executives to hold themselves accountable for costly misdeeds, Mr. Zipes argues, even if they were unaware of them. After all, top managers often take credit \u2014 and receive bonuses \u2014 for positive corporate activities in which they had little role or knew nothing about.What kinds of governance failings would be covered by the contracts? Mr. Zipes identified nine possibilities, among them imposing a reduction if a company pleaded guilty to a crime. Another might occur if an executive signed a financial document filed with the S.E.C. that subsequently proved false and required an earnings restatement of at least $5 million.Corporate executives are unlikely to sign such codes of conduct of their own volition, Mr. Zipes conceded. But independent corporate directors who are serious about their fiduciary duties to shareholders could push for these kinds of contracts, he argued.If a few corporate executives signed these kinds of agreements, and if they publicized their actions, others might feel compelled to follow. Consumers who are interested in holding executives accountable could also play a role by boycotting products at companies whose executives declined to sign such contracts.\u201cThis idea doesn\u2019t require regulation and it doesn\u2019t require new laws,\u201d Mr. Zipes said in an interview last week. \u201cExecutives can sign the binding code of conduct or not, but the idea is that the marketplace would reward those who do.\u201dWho knows how many Citi shareholders will support Mr. Naylor\u2019s proposal? But if a significant number do, that would be a big step forward in helping avoid another plague of corporate disasters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bringing African Shoppers to the Global Mall", "Date": "2015-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrototype\u201cIn Nigeria we\u2019re sometimes skeptical about online businesses,\u201d Mr. Adebayo says. So he tested the service two years ago with an inexpensive purchase, and that transaction went smoothly. Now he says he frequently shops on MallforAfrica. His purchases have included the castles, which his company takes to parties for children to jump around in, and personal items.\u201cI buy most of my children\u2019s clothing and my own clothing from there,\u201d he says of the service.Chris and Tope Folayan, two brothers who grew up in Nigeria and attended college in the United States, founded MallforAfrica in 2013. Tope earned an M.B.A. from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern. After graduating, he returned to Lagos, while Chris remained in the United States.Their company makes it easier for Nigerians to place online orders for American and British products that are difficult to find in Nigerian stores and that online retailers don\u2019t offer directly to most African consumers because of troublesome customs duties and paperwork, shipping costs and the fear of fraud.As Nigeria\u2019s middle and upper classes have grown, so has the appetite for foreign goods. But few stores sell them, and when they do, the selections are often paltry, Chris Folayan says. \u201cWhen you go into a store, you might only find three colors of Ralph Lauren Polo shirts in three sizes.\u201dItems like Pulsar watches and Juicy Couture tracksuits aren\u2019t any easier to come by. Many North American web merchants won\u2019t ship to Nigeria or other African countries. (South Africa is an exception.)\u201cThey get an order coming in from a Nigerian I.P. address and refuse to complete the order,\u201d says Zia Daniell Wigder, who studies the globalization of e-commerce as a vice president and research director for Forrester Research. Another barrier for American and European retailers is a lack of familiarity with Africa. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a region that they\u2019re comfortable with,\u201d Mr. Folayan says. \u201cThey\u2019ve never been there and they don\u2019t have a sense of the economy.\u201dMr. Folayan says he conceived of a service like MallforAfrica while working as an intern in Silicon Valley in the early 2000s. Whenever he was preparing to return to Nigeria to visit his family and friends, they would send him money to buy American products for them. He stuffed his suitcases with clothing, jewelry and electronics. By 2010, when he founded a software application development and design company in Pleasanton, Calif., he could afford to fly back to Lagos five to eight times a year. Word of these journeys spread through his Nigerian network, and the number of courier requests ballooned. \u201cI was taking more than three bags,\u201d he recalls of these trips. \u201cIt was getting ridiculously crazy. I\u2019d get to the airport, and it was like, \u2018Who in the world is this guy, and what is he doing?\u2019\u00a0\u201dIn 2011, Mr. Folayan decided to begin formalizing his delivery service. He developed a web app for buying American and British products, and asked friends and family to test it. Then in 2013, he and Tope, who had been working as a telecom executive in Lagos, founded MallforAfrica. The company now sells products from more than 120 online retailers, including Amazon, Barneys, Bloomingdale\u2019s and J. Crew. Among the most popular vendors are Children\u2019s Place, Macy\u2019s and an online retailer called Perfume Junkie, according to Mr. Folayan. This year, they began shipping to customers in Kenya and Ghana as well. They hope to expand further in Africa and, eventually, to other continents.MallforAfrica\u2019s customers place and pay for their orders through the company\u2019s web or mobile app. MallforAfrica then makes payments to other retailers on the customers\u2019 behalf. The items are delivered to MallforAfrica\u2019s warehouse in Portland, Ore. From there, the company ships the merchandise to Africa. Customers can opt for home delivery, but Mr. Folayan says most choose to pick up their products at MallforAfrica\u2019s Nigerian depots, which resemble UPS Stores. The entire process takes four to 15 days, Mr. Folayan says. He estimates that his company sends four and a half tons of products to Africa each week. Shipping orders together in large containers allows it to pay bulk rates and keep costs down. MallforAfrica charges customers a fee of 3 to 5 percent of the cost of the product. Ordering a watch that sells for $100 in the United States, for instance, would cost a Nigerian customer $117 to $120, including taxes, customs duties, shipping and the company\u2019s fee.MallforAfrica\u2019s annual sales for 2014 were $15 million to $20 million, according to Internet Retailer magazine. Mr. Folayan declined to comment on the company\u2019s sales.Perhaps one of the company\u2019s biggest challenges is Nigeria\u2019s reputation for rampant fraud schemes. \u201cWhen the word Nigeria is mentioned, everyone stays alert, looking for a fraud angle,\u201d he says. Some of the concerns are well founded \u2014 and aren\u2019t limited to Nigeria, he adds. \u201cThere are a lot of knockoff items throughout Africa. You might buy one of those Ralph Lauren shirts and find out it\u2019s not really Ralph Lauren.\u201d He says that American and British retailers are concerned that some African customers may use bogus credit cards or make false claims that their orders never arrived. To thwart fraudulent credit card charges, MallforAfrica issues its own debit cards. Customers load funds on the cards before they start shopping. And to prevent customers from claiming they did not receive their orders, MallforAfrica requires them to present identification and sign paperwork verifying receipt of the goods. His goal, Mr. Folayan says, is a thriving business based on \u201czero fraud.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nasdaq Changed in Its Climb to 5,000", "Date": "2015-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseThat the Nasdaq composite index closed over 5,000 this week for the first time in 15 years is not just a reminder of the virtues of patience. It\u2019s even more a testament to the transformative power of capitalism.\u201cJoseph Schumpeter was spot on when he said capitalism is all about creative destruction,\u201d said Richard Sylla, an economics professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business and a specialist in the history of markets, referring to the Austrian-American economist who described the phenomenon in 1942 in \u201cCapitalism, Socialism and Democracy.\u201dMany investors have forgotten that the plunge in the Nasdaq that began in 2000 was no steeper than its rise in the late 1990s \u2014 a classic formation and bursting of an investment bubble, as a glance at a chart of the Nasdaq over the past 20 years makes clear. The plunge was so severe in large part because the index\u2019s steep rise resulted from not one, but two simultaneous bubbles \u2014 one in dot-com stocks and the companies that supplied them, the other in telecommunications.The Nasdaq was up 15.67 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,982.81 on Thursday.No one thinks the Nasdaq composite, or any other broad stock index, is in bubble territory today, despite the prolonged rally that began in 2009. \u201cToday\u2019s levels are justified by the fundamentals,\u201d said Paul Wick, who has lived through both boom and bust as portfolio manager of the Columbia Seligman Communications and Information Fund, which he began managing in 1989.He notes that the Nasdaq index trades today at a far lower price-to-earnings ratio than it did in 2000. \u201cThe biggest company in the index is Apple,\u201d he said. \u201cBy every yardstick, it\u2019s a great company and it\u2019s very modestly valued.\u201dProfessor Sylla suggested that investors, now twice burned by market plunges in 2000 and 2008, were far more cautious than in the late 1990s. \u201cThe dot-com bubble was just 15, 16 years ago, so just about everyone 35 or older, an age when people begin to have money to invest, remembers it,\u201d he said. \u201cThese folks have learned some lessons about bubbles, fortunately. So current valuations, while high by most historical standards, are more reasonable than they were 15 years ago.\u201dNevertheless, at the market\u2019s current elevated levels, he said, \u201ccaution is warranted.\u201dMr. Smith, of Nasdaq, said that as a group, Nasdaq companies today \u201care bigger, older and more mature,\u201d though still younger, on average, than those in the Dow Jones industrial average or the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, the other leading market indexes.They are also more diversified. Although the Nasdaq is often considered a proxy for technology companies, they now make up about 43 percent of the Nasdaq listings, down from nearly 65 percent in 2000, according to Nasdaq. Among the nontechnology companies ranked among the top 20 today are the biotechnology companies Gilead Sciences, Amgen, Celgene and Biogen Idec as well as the retailers Walgreens Boots Alliance, Costco, eBay and Priceline, and the coffee chain Starbucks.\u201cYou could argue that these are 2000-era stocks,\u201d Mr. Wick said. \u201cTo some degree, there are always people who are willing to roll the dice. They want to own companies that might be the next big thing, and they\u2019re just wired to take the chance that some companies might turn into that. They look at exponential revenue growth, and it\u2019s easy to imagine that somewhere down the road, they\u2019re going to be hugely profitable.\u201dBut there\u2019s a different tone even with these highflying stocks, Professor Sylla said. \u201cUnlike in 1999, when adding dot-com to your name caused your company\u2019s valuation to soar, in these more mature, more sober times the recipe for stratospheric valuations is a promising product (Tesla cars) or fast-growing revenues and widespread product acceptance (Amazon), coupled with charismatic leadership.\u201d\u201cI think our markets are still doing what they long have done, namely financing entrepreneurship and innovation,\u201d he continued. \u201cNo one can know the future, but the markets encourage investors to make bets on it and some of those bets pay off, for investors and buyers of innovative products. Wall Street is much more than the rich man\u2019s racetrack, as some have described it. It\u2019s what helps to move our economy and our standard of living forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plenty of Noise, but Not Much Guidance From Fed or Company Reports", "Date": "2015-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe markets are suffering from information overload. Investors have been receiving guidance about the future, but it\u2019s not clear what they should do about it. I\u2019m thinking of the guidance coming from two sets of important sources. One is the Federal Reserve, which controls short-term interest rates and influences longer-term rates, too. The other is the array of publicly traded American corporations reporting earnings for the last three months of 2014 \u2014 and opining about earnings prospects well into the future.Because investors should care about what will happen to their money in the future, all of this guidance could be very helpful. Yet, except as an exercise in elaborate signaling behavior, there\u2019s little evidence that it has been useful. First, let\u2019s look at what the Fed has been saying. Edward Yardeni, an independent market researcher, put it this way: \u201cShe said the Fed will be \u2018data dependent\u2019 \u2014 and basically that means that once the Fed knows what it\u2019s doing, it will let the rest of us know.\u201d There\u2019s more to the Fed guidance, including new market signals, which Ms. Yellen explained. It centers on the word \u201cpatient\u201d \u2014 the Fed\u2019s characterization of its attitude about raising rates. For the moment, the stock market took the new Fed information as a signal that nothing much had changed. It barely moved over the course of the week, although stocks fell a bit on the second day of Ms. Yellen\u2019s testimony, when she had spirited exchanges with House Republicans who criticized the Fed\u2019s expansive monetary policy. The market has been rising \u2014 for the most part \u2014 since March 2009, in no small measure because of that policy, which makes stocks and other assets relatively attractive, compared with low-yielding fixed-income instruments. Ms. Yellen\u2019s prepared testimony seemed aimed at keeping the market calm \u2014 not only now but whenever the Fed actually decides to raise interest rates.Recently, the market has been rising despite a barrage of corporate reports that might suggest that stock prices are overextended. After all, growth in both revenue and earnings for the last quarter has decelerated. For the 440 companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index that had reported by Wednesday, revenue for the fourth quarter rose only 1.5 percent over the period a year ago, compared with a 4.1 percent growth rate for the third quarter at the same point in the previous earnings season, Mr. Yardeni said.Comparable numbers for earnings were an annual increase of 5.9 percent in the fourth quarter, versus a 10.4 percent rise at the same point in the previous earnings season. The strong dollar, falling oil prices and a sluggish global economy have all taken their toll. What\u2019s worse, guidance for future earnings turned extremely pessimistic. Bespoke Investment Group examined 1,680 publicly traded companies that reported earnings between Jan. 12 and Feb. 19. After subtracting downgraded guidance from upgrades, it found that, on average, companies had downgraded their earnings prospects by \u201ca ridiculously low\u201d net 9.5 percentage points. Corporate guidance hasn\u2019t been that bleak since the end of the financial crisis in the first quarter of 2009.Companies that lowered their guidance were punished for it. On average, this earnings season, their shares declined 2.7 percent on the day of the announcement. Yet despite the mediocre profit performance and warnings of worse to come, the market has remained buoyant. \u201cWe\u2019re in danger of a market melt-up,\u201d a surge that isn\u2019t supported by fundamentals, Mr. Yardeni said. \u201cThe problem with a melt-up,\u201d he said, \u201cis that it will lead to a meltdown.\u201dOf course, corporate executives have been known to engage in signaling behavior of their own \u2014 deliberately lowering expectations ahead of time so their company will register \u201ca positive earnings surprise.\u201d Companies facing an earnings squeeze may be paving the way for positive surprises later.That\u2019s why Laszlo Birinyi, an independent strategist who has been bullish since 2009, says most of these signals mean very little. \u201cApple\u2019s made an art form of lowering expectations and then beating them,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe other companies are learning from them.\u201d Canny investors should learn from this behavior, he said. Fundamentally, he says, in the months before a Fed rate increase, the stock market has tended to rise, and he expects that to happen now. \u201cBull markets usually continue until there is a big shock or a recession, which we can\u2019t predict,\u201d he said.Most of the deluge of information is maneuvering, signaling and just plain noise, in his view. \u201cI don\u2019t see a recession coming right now. And in the meantime, while the market may run into some trouble, we\u2019re still in a bull market \u2014 until we\u2019re not, but we don\u2019t know when that will be.\u201d The recent guidance won\u2019t help with that.

{"Headline": "Boston Celebrates End of Ban as Gays March in St. Patrick\u2019s Parade", "Date": "2015-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 Despite a gray chill and spits of rain that gave way to a downpour and later snow, hundreds of thousands of people celebrated a new chapter in this city\u2019s history on Sunday as the storied South Boston St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade opened its ranks for the first time to gays and lesbians.\u201cTo be included in this parade and be part of this parade is just really special for us,\u201d said David Story, 65, a finance manager and a veteran of the Air Force. A member of OutVets, which honors lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender veterans, he and other members wore navy blue jackets branded with the group\u2019s logo and a rainbow.\u201cWe\u2019re marching not just for us, but for all the closeted L.G.B.T. people who have been in the Air Force, are in the military, for years past, and the ones that may be in now,\u201d he said. The South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, a private group that organizes the 114-year-old parade, had banned gay groups from participating for decades, saying it was no place for people who were vocal about their sexual orientation. In 1995, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld what it said was the group\u2019s First Amendment right to exclude whomever it wanted. But that stance turned the parade into an annual battleground for the gay-rights movement, and it forced many Massachusetts politicians, including Boston\u2019s mayor, to skip the parade, which is an essential part of Boston history and culture. Not only does it celebrate the city\u2019s important Irish heritage, but the parade also honors a Revolutionary War holiday unique to Boston and its environs called Evacuation Day. On March 17, 1776, the Continental Army, under the command of George Washington, forced the British to retreat.The veterans\u2019 council last year changed leadership. And in December, the group voted 5 to 4 to invite OutVets to participate. More recently, it invited Boston Pride, a large gay-rights organization.John Hurley, 84, a member of the council and the major impediment to including gays, missed that December meeting, and so did not vote. He told The Dorchester Reporter last week that had he been present, he would have opposed extending invitations to gays, saying they have their own parades and should not be interfering in this one.But much of Boston seemed thrilled that the parade was finally more inclusive, and for the first time in two decades, since the Supreme Court ruling, the mayor joined the marchers.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of moving on to a new chapter of Boston\u2019s history,\u201d Mayor Marty Walsh told reporters before stepping off with a gaggle of public officials, including Gov. Charlie Baker, who stopped often as paradegoers snapped selfies with him.Ayanna Pressley, a Boston city councilor, joked that because she had never marched in the parade, she had made the mistake of wearing high heels.\u201cI didn\u2019t come prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cSee? I\u2019m so not used to it.\u201dMany paradegoers said they appreciated the gay groups\u2019 inclusion. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge privilege to be here, to witness that,\u201d said Nora Yotts, 27, who works for a dry cleaner and who cheered as the OutVets contingent marched by. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge step, them being military and gay as well,\u201d she said.The parade route was rejiggered and cut in half this year because waist-high mounds of snow left over from the winter\u2019s record snowfall still clog South Boston\u2019s narrow streets. Volunteer crews with front-loaders spent the last several days clearing the new route. As people left the jammed streets, the rain turned to snow \u2014 adding enough to this winter\u2019s accumulation to break by one inch the record of 107.6 inches set in 1995-96. The weather was a major topic earlier in the day at South Boston\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day breakfast, an annual political roast that precedes the parade. Many jokes revolved around the depressing winter, the systemwide failure of the region\u2019s rickety subway and commuter rail lines, and the local custom of saving shoveled-out parking spots with furniture and household items.Governor Baker told the attendees that he would like to get to work, \u201cif Maura Healey would stop putting her lawn chair in my parking space.\u201d Ms. Healey, a Democrat, is the state\u2019s popular new attorney general and is widely perceived as a potential challenger to Mr. Baker, a Republican.Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, produced his own favorite space-saver: the Vince Lombardi Trophy, which his team won at the Super Bowl in February. Also the butt of frequent jokes: Hillary Rodham Clinton and her use of a private email address, and the long-windedness of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who called in to the televised breakfast and spoke at length.Halfway through his ramble, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you a quick story.\u201d It was his only line that got a laugh.When Mr. Biden\u2019s call ended, Representative Stephen F. Lynch, a Democrat, said: \u201cI just hope he didn\u2019t call collect. Holy cow. That was painful.\u201dSenator Elizabeth Warren, who took the podium to \u201cHail to the Chief,\u201d said she hoped to be briefer than Mr. Lynch and funnier than Mr. Biden, acknowledging that she was setting the bar low.Ms. Warren, a Democrat, said that in Washington, she was focused on the economy and noted that a lot of people \u201chave entirely given up on looking for work \u2014 but enough about Scott Brown.\u201dAnd this winter has been so brutal, she said, \u201cthat Mitt Romney left his money here and he went to the Cayman Islands.\u201dThe roast concluded on a serious note, with Michael Flaherty, a city councilor, thanking the Allied War Veterans for its wisdom and tolerance in accepting gays into the parade. He said thousands of South Boston families had gay family members, \u201cand hopefully this will be the best St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade those folks have had in 20 years.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Poorer and Richer ", "Date": "2015-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOME arguments are hard to settle but are too important to avoid. Here is one: whether the social crisis among America\u2019s poor and working class \u2014 the collapse of the two-parent family, the weakening of communal ties \u2014 is best understood as a problem of economics or of culture.Their argument gets some things right. The American economy isn\u2019t performing as well as it once did for less-skilled workers. Certain regions \u2014 like Putnam\u2019s Ohio \u2014 have suffered painfully from deindustrialization. The shift to a service economy has favored women but has made low-skilled men less marriageable. The decline of unions has weakened professional stability and bargaining power for some workers.And yet, for all these disturbances and shifts, lower-income Americans have more money, experience less poverty, and receive far more safety-net support than their grandparents ever did. Over all, material conditions have improved, not worsened, across the period when their communities have come apart.This is a dense debate whose surface I can only skim. (Inequality as well as absolute income enters into it, as does immigration, cost inflation for key goods \u2014 including weddings! \u2014 and more.)But the basic point is this: In a substantially poorer American past with a much thinner safety net, lower-income Americans found a way to cultivate monogamy, fidelity, sobriety and thrift to an extent that they have not in our richer, higher-spending present.So however much money matters, something else is clearly going on.The post-1960s cultural revolution isn\u2019t the only possible \u201csomething else.\u201d But when you have a cultural earthquake that makes society dramatically more permissive and you subsequently get dramatic social fragmentation among vulnerable populations, denying that there is any connection looks a lot like denying the nose in front of your face.This judgment would echo Leonard Cohen:Now you can say that I\u2019ve grown bitter but of this you may be sure\u00a0/The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor.And without dismissing money\u2019s impact on the social fabric, it would raise the possibility that what\u2019s on those channels sometimes matters more.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s Tense Talks With Its Creditors Escalate to the Next Phase", "Date": "2015-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Greece\u2019s debt negotiations with its international creditors will proceed to the next, more technical level later this week, as a result of an agreement reached on Monday by eurozone finance ministers.The left-led Athens government, which came to power in January on a pledge to stop Greece\u2019s capitulation to inspectors from the so-called troika that represents the country\u2019s creditors, immediately began taking pains to say the new round of talks will be on its own terms.\u201cThere is no further time to lose,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, said here at a news conference Monday evening. The talks \u201cmust and will start\u201d on Wednesday, he said.And though the Greek government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has been insisting that it will negotiate with the creditors only in Brussels, to avoid the continued stigma of inspectors periodically occupying Athens, Eurogroup members on Monday indicated that it was not feasible to get a clear picture of the Greek economy without emissaries visiting Greece\u2019s capital.\u201cSome people will have to be on the ground in Athens,\u201d Mr. Dijsselbloem said. That visit would be in addition to the meeting with the Greek officials in Brussels on Wednesday, although Mr. Dijsselbloem did not say when it would take place.The visitors would be given \u201cfull access\u201d to Greek officials, Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, told a news conference after the meeting. But those visitors should not \u201center the ministries\u201d displaying \u201ca kind of power play that smacked of a colonial attitude,\u201d said Mr. Varoufakis. \u201cThat practice is finished.\u201d Although European officials had agreed in principle in late February to disburse an additional 7 billion euros, or about $7.6 billion, from Greece\u2019s bailout program, they have indicated that no money will be released before a full assessment of the Greek economy is complete and overhauls are in place.And they have said it would happen only if the new left-leaning Greek government could demonstrate it was serious about improving its tax-collecting efforts and making structural changes in the economy.Greece could have access bailout money as soon as it moves to pass laws and make those structural changes, Mr. Dijsselbloem said at the news conference. But those payments would be made only once such steps are \u201cwell off the ground,\u201d he said.Payments to Greece could be \u201ccut into parts, which we\u2019ve done before,\u201d he said, apparently offering Greece the incentive of financial rewards each time it made significant progress toward its creditors\u2019 goals.Asked for his assessment about the current cash position of Greece, Mr. Varoufakis declined to offer numbers. He said Greece\u2019s liquidity position would be \u201cguaranteed\u201d by the government and its creditors.In an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Saturday, Mr. Varoufakis said Greece could call elections or a referendum in the event that its proposed overhauls are rejected by international creditors. As the Greek news media feverishly speculated over the weekend about a possible referendum on the country\u2019s membership in the eurozone, the government accused the newspaper of distorting the minister\u2019s comments, saying he had not suggested Greece would hold a referendum on the euro but on the country\u2019s economic program and fiscal policy.Panos Kammenos, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s junior coalition partner and the defense minister, also suggested on Saturday that a referendum could be an option.Antonis Samaras, the former prime minister, on Sunday rejected a potential referendum as a \u201cvery bad development,\u201d saying it would allow the government to shirk its responsibilities. The criticism continued on Monday with central members of Mr. Samaras\u2019s conservative party describing Mr. Varoufakis as \u201cdangerous\u201d because of both the referendum idea and his proposal to employ Greeks and tourists as undercover agents to bolster a tax evasion crackdown.Some officials of the Syriza-led government also expressed reservations about a referendum, which the prominent legislator Alexis Mitropoulos described as \u201cna\u00efve and thoughtless.\u201dAt his news conference late on Monday, Mr. Varoufakis denounced the way his comments had been presented in Corriere della Serra as part of a \u201cprocess of misinformation.\u201d Mr. Varoufakis said any reference that he made to a referendum had been entirely \u201chypothetical\u201d because he was referring to the improbable circumstance that European lenders rejected all of Greece\u2019s proposed reforms. Opinion polls consistently indicate that most Greeks want the country to remain in the eurozone, but a majority continue to back the government\u2019s tough stance against creditors.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens.

The president announced that his administration had enlisted 21 cities or regions and about 300 private-sector employers to expand training programs and would chip in $100 million in federal money for grants to encourage innovative approaches.\u201cWe are going to more effectively capture what is the boundless energy and talent of Americans who have the will but sometimes need a little help clearing out the way,\u201d Mr. Obama told an audience of mayors and other municipal leaders attending a conference of the National League of Cities in Washington. \u201cHelp them get on a path to fill the new jobs of this century.

It also prevents them from traveling to the United States. American officials, however, seemed uncertain this week of the effect of the measures because it\u2019s unclear whether the blacklisted officials have substantial ties to the United States. For now, the showdown stands to provide Mr. Maduro with political cover and excuses amid a widening economic crisis that is largely his fault. To shore up his flagging popular support, he accuses the United States of waging an economic war against his country to drive him out of power. While American sanctions might hurt some Venezuelan officials, it seems unlikely that they would curb abuses by the government and could even embolden Mr. Maduro. A more productive approach might be to increase efforts to persuade Latin American leaders to speak up for democratic principles in Venezuela and further isolate a leader who is becoming a regional pariah.

{"Headline": "Ryanair Dangles Possibility of Ultracheap Trans-Atlantic Travel", "Date": "2015-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Nearly a decade after it first floated the idea of $10 flights between London and New York, Ryanair, Europe\u2019s largest discount airline, is once again dangling the possibility of ultracheap travel across the Atlantic.The service is still at least four years in the future, and it might be that talk of such rock-bottom fares is nothing more than a promotional gimmick. Still, the prospect of Ryanair eventually entering the trans-Atlantic market can only cause new anxiety for Europe\u2019s biggest carriers as they struggle to compete against nimbler rivals at home and abroad.\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing that ought to make the European majors quake in their boots,\u201d said Peter Morris, chief economist at Ascend, an aviation consulting firm based in London.With upstart airlines now charging passengers as little as $99 to cross the Atlantic, though not necessarily profitably, the question will be whether Ryanair can make its knack for budget economics work on a transoceanic scale.On Monday, Ryanair, based in Dublin, confirmed reports that its board had approved a loose plan to begin operating \u201clow-cost\u201d flights between two dozen cities in Europe and the United States sometime around the turn of the decade.\u201cEuropean consumers want lower-cost travel to the U.S.A., and the same for Americans coming to Europe,\u201d the airline said in a statement. \u201cWe see it as a logical development in the European market.\u201d It declined to comment further on the board\u2019s move, which was first reported by The Financial Times.Michael O\u2019Leary, Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, has long wanted to replicate the airline\u2019s success on the lucrative routes linking Europe and North America. But until now, Ryanair has seemed to prefer watching from the sideline.Norwegian Air Shuttle, based in Oslo, began flying trans-Atlantic in 2013 and now operates discounted flights to a half-dozen American cities, including New York and Los Angeles, from European bases in Copenhagen, Stockholm and Gatwick Airport, near London, with one-way fares as low as $244.This month, Lufthansa, the German flagship carrier, detailed its plans to start offering in October a handful of budget flights from Cologne, Germany, to tourist destinations in Cuba and the Dominican Republic under its nascent international budget brand, Eurowings. One-way fares will start at around $100.WestJet of Canada began operating seasonal flights between Toronto and Dublin last summer and plans to add services between Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and Glasgow in June, with fares as low as $261 one way.WOW, a low-cost Icelandic airline, recently began marketing services between Reykjavik and several East Coast cities in the United States for as low as $99 one way \u2014 with onward connecting service to Gatwick for an additional $72 or so.But analysts say it is unclear how many of these cheap fares are \u2014 or ever can be \u2014 sustainably profitable. Norwegian Air, for example, swung to a net loss of more than 1 billion krone, or about $120 million, in 2014 amid heavy investments in new aircraft to support its long-haul expansion plans.Cheap flights over longer distances have always been a tricky business formula for carriers \u2014 mainly for reasons of cost and logistics, but also in terms of passenger comfort.Traveling long distances means burning more fuel, of course, and limits the number of daily flights that can be made with each plane in an airline\u2019s fleet. And while young backpackers might be willing to endure being wedged into narrow economy-class seats for six or seven hours and forgoing free meals or movies, such privations are less likely to be acceptable to business travelers.That is why even Ryanair has long said that it would eventually need to break with its current system of one-class seating to offer a significant number of premium-economy or even business-class seats on its planes. Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer, told The Financial Times that the airline would probably earmark as many as half of the seats on any trans-Atlantic flight to higher-paying passengers.Chris Tarry, an analyst at Ctaira, a British aviation consulting firm, said airlines were no different than retailers. \u201cThey need to maximize the revenue of every inch of floor space,\u201d he said.That is likely to severely limit the number of truly rock-bottom fares on Ryanair\u2019s proposed trans-Atlantic brand. Mr. Jacobs told The Financial Times that Ryanair expected most of its one-way tickets from London to cost upward of $145.Yet such fares would still be well below the $500 to $700 that major European and American carriers routinely charge for round-trip economy-class flights across the Atlantic today.Even before receiving the blessing of its board, Ryanair had long said that any trans-Atlantic expansion would be contingent on acquiring a fleet of long-range jets \u2014 most likely among the latest generation of fuel-thrifty wide-body jets like as the Boeing 787 or Airbus A350 \u2014 at a reasonable price. But both manufacturers are still struggling to increase production rates of such planes.\u201cAt the moment there is a scarcity of aircraft that is keeping the prices up, particularly for new aircraft,\u201d said Mr. Morris, the Ascend chief economist. He suggested that in the interest of obtaining suitable planes more quickly, Ryanair could seek a deal to buy a large number of older planes like the Airbus A330 or Boeing\u2019s 777 \u2014 models that both makers plan to phase out over the next two to three years in favor of revamped versions with newer engines.That would mean forgoing the fuel economy of newer aircraft, however, which would probably drive Ryanair to seek those older planes at a hefty discount \u2014 something Boeing or Airbus might be unwilling to accept.Ryanair, Europe\u2019s largest carrier by number of passengers, will also need to contend with the challenge of brand recognition in the United States.\u201cIt is going to be difficult for Ryanair to attract U.S.-based traffic,\u201d Mr. Morris said.While Ryanair\u2019s website says it serves \u201cthousands\u201d of American travelers across its vast European network, that figure is a tiny fraction of the 89 million passengers it carried in the last year.\u201cYou are basically starting from zero there,\u201d Mr. Morris said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "O.E.C.D. Will Advise Greece on Economic Overhauls", "Date": "2015-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Greece will get advice from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on ways to revamp the country\u2019s economy, under a deal announced on Thursday.The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and the head of the O.E.C.D., Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, made the announcement at a news conference in Paris, indicating that Mr. Gurr\u00eda\u2019s group would help Greece with the economic changes that its international creditors are demanding in exchange for unlocking additional bailout money.The O.E.C.D. is a research and discussion forum for the world\u2019s most advanced economies.Mr. Tsipras also pledged on Thursday that Greece\u2019s embattled government would pursue economic overhauls and chase down tax evaders. In addition, he asserted that the era of painful austerity measures demanded by the country\u2019s creditors, which he said had devastated his country\u2019s growth and social services, had come to an end.\u201cThere will be reforms that will be promoted because we are now at a turning point,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said. \u201cWe have a new government that does not depend on the financial oligopolies, we are not dependent on the past. We have a government that is supported by a majority of the people.\u201dThat government, elected in January on the promise to strike a new deal with Greece\u2019s creditors, has frequently voiced resentment against representatives of the so-called troika \u2014 the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 that is overseeing Greece\u2019s 240 billion-euro, or $255 billion, bailout program.Asked at the news conference whether the O.E.C.D.\u2019s guidance in Greece\u2019s economic overhaul might diminish the role of the troika, Mr. Gurr\u00eda replied, \u201cEverybody has a job to do.\u201dHe elaborated in a statement by saying that the O.E.C.D. \u201cis not replacing any other institution that the government is working with.\u201d The organization will help Greece create jobs, reduce bureaucracy and improve the efficiency of its public finances, he said.The Greek government is in a race with the calendar to persuade the troika to provide it with additional loan money necessary to avoid risking default.But the Tsipras government contests some of the terms of the bailout agreement and has proposed some different measures.The Greek government nonetheless remains committed to putting the February agreement into effect, Mr. Tsipras said on Thursday, noting that he was comfortable with the state of the negotiations. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that I have a noose around my neck,\u201d he said.Recently, though, tensions have risen between Greek officials and their German counterparts, who have demanded a hard line on the negotiations. Germany, as the richest country in the eurozone, plays a lead role in those talks.Mr. Tsipras this week accused Berlin of using \u201clegal tricks\u201d to avoid paying compensation for its World War II occupation of Greece. His justice minister, Nikos Paraskevopoulos, suggested that the Greek authorities could seize German property in Greece as compensation. Germany contends that it has settled all of its World War II obligations.As hopes for a quick compromise on Greece\u2019s debt have faded, Greek bond yields \u2014 often seen as a proxy for market confidence and a guide to what it would cost the state to borrow on the market \u2014 have risen sharply.On Thursday, the five-year government bond was trading to yield 14.1 percent, well above its recent low in the past month of 10.6 percent. That was in sharp contrast to the comparable German bond, the European benchmark, which had a yield of minus 0.114 percent \u2014 a negative rate indicating that buyers were willing to pay Germany\u2019s government to hold their money.Greece\u2019s spiking bond yields suggest significant concern about the outlook for a debt deal and the prospects of the country\u2019s eventually having to leave the currency union if it cannot avoid default.Advertisement"}

China shipped a record 100 million metric tons of steel overseas in the 12 months ended in February, a 55 percent increase from the previous year.\u201cI\u2019m sure they are happy that at least somebody is buying it, but I don\u2019t think that this is a strategy that Beijing wants to follow,\u201d said Louis Kuijs, the chief economist for greater China at the Royal Bank of Scotland.The country\u2019s traditional drivers of growth \u2014 manufacturing, real estate and local government infrastructure spending \u2014 are now among the biggest threats to China\u2019s economy.A slowdown in those areas is expected, and even accounted for in the country\u2019s economic outlook. But economists and analysts say the pullback could be more painful than China and its leaders are ready to handle.While Beijing has emphasized reorienting the economy toward consumer spending and market forces, its policy goals around jobs, growth and inflation are still greatly dependent on heavy industry and manufacturing. But the health of industries like steel, railways or housing construction is highly interconnected, and stress in one can put pressure on the others.The latest economic data offer little comfort.\u201cIf you look at what companies are suffering the most in China, it is heavy industry,\u201d Mr. Kuijs said.So far, China\u2019s leaders have remained publicly sanguine. In a speech last week, Premier Li Keqiang lowered the official growth target for this year to about 7 percent, which would be the country\u2019s slowest expansion in a quarter-century. He drove home the importance of reducing China\u2019s reliance on traditional industry and credit-fueled investment, replacing them with consumer demand as a pillar of the economy.\u201cIn expanding consumption, we need to ensure that every drop of spending builds to create a mighty river, so that the potential contained in an ocean of private consumers will be channeled into a powerful force driving economic growth,\u201d Mr. Li said.China\u2019s leaders have also sounded a new note of caution about the impact on job creation.China added 13.2 million urban jobs last year, surpassing its target of 10 million. But the number of newly created positions fell in the first two months of this year compared with a year ago, Yin Weimin, the minister of human resources and social security, told reporters on Tuesday in Beijing on the sidelines of the weeklong annual meeting of the party-appointed national legislature.\u201cAgainst a backdrop of slower economic growth, increasing downward pressure on the economy and of industrial restructuring, this year\u2019s employment situation will be even more complex and grim,\u201d Mr. Yin said, declining to provide specific figures on the number of jobs added so far this year.The upheaval in China\u2019s traditional economy is already being felt by workers like Chen Huabin.For years, Mr. Chen worked in export sales at a privately owned steel plant in Yangzhou, a city in eastern Jiangsu Province. Mr. Chen, 35, said the plant\u2019s operations expanded greatly from 2003 to 2009, growing from 150 employees to 1,800.\u201cAt that time, the boss was really confident of the market and decided to invest all the profits to build more facilities,\u201d Mr. Chen said in a recent interview. \u201cIt was also easy to get a loan. So we had been expanding blindly.\u201dThen the steel industry got whipsawed by a wave of challenges, like the global financial crisis and antidumping tariffs. Mr. Chen quit in late 2013. He switched sides, setting up his own business, which helps companies from the Middle East and Southeast Asia buy steel from China.\u201cNow it\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market, and I need to take advantage of this,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I changed my role.\u201dThe effects of such industrial changes ripple outward through the economy. For example, as housing prices fall, developers curtail projects under construction. Fewer new high-rises means factories churn out less steel, cement and glass \u2014 and what they do produce, they sell more cheaply. Activity then slows at the mines and quarries that provide the raw materials for these industrial goods, affecting mining companies from western China to Western Australia.\u201cThe near-term dilemma is that the slowdown in the traditional sectors is happening very quickly, in the real estate market or manufacturing sectors,\u201d said Haibin Zhu, the chief China economist at J. P. Morgan in Hong Kong. \u201cIt will take time for new sectors to be developed and to eventually substitute the pillar industries.\u201dSuch reforms could undermine infrastructure construction, which has long been a priority of the leadership in Beijing. Under a national initiative called \u201cone belt one road,\u201d the government is spending billions on new rail, road and port infrastructure. The goal is to improve China\u2019s ties to Western Europe and Southeast Asia.Chinese leaders say that would provide a major boost to the economy by improving transportation links for both freight and passengers. The infrastructure upgrades alone will create hundreds of thousands of construction jobs.But closer inspection of the economics behind this huge build-out raises questions. Consider rail, where Mr. Li, the premier, said last week that the government intends to spend 800 billion renminbi, or about $130 billion, this year on new lines.Around 60 percent of all rail freight traffic in China comes from transporting coal. The amount of rail freight fell about 11 percent in December and 9 percent in January compared with a year earlier \u2014 the steepest decline since the financial crisis. The slump is partly tied to fewer shipments of coking coal, which is mainly used in the steel industry.The slowdown comes at a vulnerable time for China\u2019s rail industry, which is facing overcapacity and is heavily indebted. China Railway Corporation, the main rail operator that was spun out of the Ministry of Railways in 2013, had total debt at the end of September of 3.5 trillion renminbi, or about $567 billion \u2014 up 26 percent from the end of 2012.China\u2019s economy and financial system remain dominated by the state, and the government can always nurture short-term growth by flooding the economy with credit. In the meantime, the state news media is trying to stoke enthusiasm and confidence in the economy.After several years of castigating officials who seek promotion by focusing on gross domestic product growth at the expense of social issues or the environment, Communist Party-controlled news outlets have changed course.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At JPMorgan Chase, Business Tilts Toward the Consumer Side and Away From Wall St.", "Date": "2015-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA reversal of fortunes within the financial industry is illustrated in few places more vividly than JPMorgan Chase. A few years ago, the company\u2019s consumer bank, Chase, was struggling under the weight of the mortgage crisis and a slow economy while the JPMorgan investment bank thrived.More recently, however, it was the head of the consumer bank, Gordon Smith, who was sounding upbeat and jocular as he spoke, with his English accent, about his growing business during a presentation at the company\u2019s annual investor day, pointing to opportunities like the bank\u2019s new mobile app and the improving credit of the American consumer.A few hours earlier that same day, Daniel Pinto, the Argentine-born head of the company\u2019s investment bank, was notably less cheery as he reviewed billions of dollars in cuts his division will be making and reductions in his future financial projections, even as his team has gained relative to competitors.It was not discussed during the investor day last week, but it is Mr. Smith who is in line to succeed Jamie Dimon should JPMorgan Chase need a new chief executive in the near future, according to company executives briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.In the past, the succession line at JPMorgan Chase was generally thought to run through the more complicated and, at the time, more profitable investment bank. When it came time for Mr. Dimon to speak to the company\u2019s investors, he joked about the unexpected nature of a situation in which it is the Wall Street power brokers who are on the back foot.\u201cI tell Daniel and all the guys, all the folks from the investment bank, it\u2019s really weird to feel sorry for the investment bank, isn\u2019t it? You have to confess,\u201d Mr. Dimon said, drawing a laugh from the audience.The diverging prospects for JPMorgan\u2019s biggest businesses reflect a split within the broader financial industry. Investors are betting that banks like Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp, which focus primarily on American consumers, will grow much faster than firms like Goldman Sachs, which are concentrated on Wall Street business.JPMorgan is a particularly stark indication of the trends because it has maintained dominant operations in both consumer and investment banking.The investment bank led by Mr. Pinto has been improving its position relative to competitors, gaining market share in areas like stock trading and European banking, cementing its place as the largest investment bank in the world. But while profits at JPMorgan Chase rose to a record level last year, profits from the investment bank fell 16 percent from the previous year to the lowest level since 2011. Mr. Pinto still oversees an enormous operation that accounts for about a third of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s total revenue. When judged by the returns it provides to shareholders, though, the investment bank has become the worst performing major division in the company. The return on equity \u2014 a commonly used measure of profitability \u2014 was around 20 percent in the consumer division last year. In the Wall Street operation it was half that. Moving forward, Mr. Pinto lowered his projected returns for future years to 13 percent from 15 percent, bringing it below even the struggling mortgage lending operation. The gap between the different businesses inside JPMorgan is a large part of the reason an analyst at Goldman Sachs suggested that the company might be worth more if the investment bank was broken off as a separate business. JPMorgan\u2019s executives resist any suggestion that the bank should be split up. But the lagging performance is forcing Mr. Pinto to consider cutting expenses more sharply than other divisions of the company must. Over the last four years, the investment bank has already reduced costs by 10 percent, largely by cutting front-office salaries. And last week Mr. Pinto outlined another round of cuts that he expected to bring expenses down an additional 13 percent. \u201cIt is a point where you really need to embrace the change, disrupt your model and do what it takes in order to maintain the leadership position that we have going forward,\u201d he said. The recalculation is being brought on by several factors, some of them temporary. The regulatory pressure on the investment bank remains strong as it faces potential fines over accusations that traders colluded to manipulate various financial benchmarks; it is not alone in facing this pressure.The continuing low interest rates have also reduced activity on trading desks across the industry, something that Mr. Pinto suggested was likely to change soon. Indeed, he suggested that trading revenue during the first weeks of 2015 had improved significantly.But even if that continues, the trading desks that provide a majority of the investment bank\u2019s revenue face major headwinds that are not likely to fade away. In 2014, the single biggest driver of falling returns was the increased amount of loss-absorbing capital that JPMorgan needed to allocate for every trade it did \u2014 a result of the stepped-up capital requirements put forward by the Federal Reserve. Such capital costs the investment bank real money that is not required, to the same degree, by the consumer bank, and reduced returns for Mr. Pinto by 1.8 percentage points last year. In the coming years, JPMorgan is likely to have to raise even more capital, and more so than other banks because of JPMorgan\u2019s size and complexity. Most of the rising capital requirements are tied to the capital-intensive operations under Mr. Pinto\u2019s purview.Mr. Pinto said he was taking several steps to curtail business lines that require disproportionate amounts of capital. That could force the firm to potentially stop clearing certain derivatives trades for customers and holding deposits for some clients, like foreign banks.Mr. Dimon said that he got a note from one of his top deputies, reminding him that in past years it was the investment bank that was \u201ccarrying the load while we were sucking wind in card and mortgage. And it\u2019s hard to remember today.\u201dThe bank chief said the situations would most likely reverse again, but his executives provided no timeline for when that might happen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We\u2019re Frighteningly in the Dark About Student Debt", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewImagine that a big, complicated company holds a huge portfolio of loans, many of which are in default or delinquency. The company\u2019s leadership and some vocal shareholders demand a detailed review but receive a thin and incomplete report from the loan division. Financial analysts at headquarters want to scrutinize the data. But the loan division doesn\u2019t turn it over. Without better data, the firm can\u2019t move forward.This dysfunctional enterprise is fictional, but in at least some respects it bears more than a passing resemblance to the United States government, which has a portfolio of roughly $1 trillion in student loans, many of which appear to be troubled. The Education Department, which oversees the portfolio, is playing the part of the loan division \u2014 neither analyzing the portfolio adequately nor allowing other agencies to do so. Student debt has grabbed the attention of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Officials in these organizations worry that student debt threatens the well-being of households and the federal budget, since taxpayers are liable if student loans go unpaid. Several years ago, the mortgage crisis caught policy makers flat-footed, and they are determined not to be surprised by a possible future collapse rooted in household debt. \u201cWhile regulators have beefed up monitoring of the mortgage market, similar efforts are needed to better understand and address the drivers of the millions of student loan defaults that have piled up in recent years,\u201d said Rohit Chopra, the consumer bureau\u2019s student loan ombudsman.The frightening reality, however, is that we are remarkably ignorant about student debt. How many borrowers are delinquent on their federal loans? How does delinquency differ by amount of debt, income and education? Which colleges leave students underwater, with low earnings and large debts they can\u2019t pay? That\u2019s just a start. We also don\u2019t know how many borrowers are eligible for federal debt relief, which caps payments and forgives balances, or how many have tried, but failed, to get such relief. Because we can\u2019t answer these questions, we can\u2019t quantify the risks that student debt places on individual households and the economy as a whole. This limits our ability to help borrowers before they spiral into default.Why can\u2019t we answer these basic questions about student debt? The Education Department runs the federal loan program, but it has not released detailed analyses or handed the data to those who could do the necessary number-crunching. The Federal Reserve, which tries to keep a close eye on household debt, has purchased credit records from Equifax that let it track trends in student debt. That\u2019s right: The central bank relies on a private firm for data about student loans, when much of the data it needs is held by a federal agency. The credit records are better than nothing, but they lack crucial details like the type of loan and the college the borrower attended.But this data doesn\u2019t say much. It does not provide delinquency rates for all loans, for example, or information about how many borrowers have managed to renew their debt relief. To get such additional information, Ms. Horn suggested, a Freedom of Information Act request would be appropriate.David A. Bergeron spent 34 years at the Education Department, ending up as an assistant secretary for postsecondary education. He left in 2013 and is now vice president for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, a Washington research organization. Mr. Bergeron says he is frustrated by the incomplete data. \u201cThe department releases only very high-level summary statistics, which do not allow us to understand the problems facing individual student borrowers,\u201d he said. \u201cTrying to solve a problem with incomplete information leads you to the wrong solutions.\u201dThis close oversight is critical for preventing another mortgage crisis. And it\u2019s a terrific model for what we should be doing with student loans. But at the moment, the federal student loan data remains locked within the walls of the Education Department, with limited metrics trickling out.Asked for a response to this criticism, Ms. Horn declined to comment. Over at the Federal Reserve and consumer bureau, as well as outside the government, highly trained analysts are eager for data. One solution might be for the Education Department to put it in their hands and let them get to work. A longer-term solution could be to move the loan program out of the Education Department entirely \u2014 either into an existing agency that has the statistical expertise or a new student-loan authority. In Britain, an independent public agency has been devoted to student loans for 25 years. Analyzing the complicated student loan market may not be a job for the current Education Department, which lacks a chief economist. Another agency might be better equipped to handle it, allowing the department to focus on its central goal: improving education.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economic Reform Is Best Path for Greece", "Date": "2015-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyGreece has no good Plan B\u2019s. Its only rational course of action is to work with its eurozone creditors to reform its economy.Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, is in a bind. He agreed to a short-term deal with other eurozone governments last month. But he has found it difficult to sell this to hardliners in his radical-left Syriza party back home, who accuse him of making a U-turn.Some of the rhetoric since that deal from Mr. Tsipras\u2019s ministerial colleagues, such as promises to cancel privatizations, has been troubling. So have decisions such as raising the salaries of electricity workers.Meanwhile, Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister, has sent a rather thin list of proposed reforms to his eurozone counterparts in advance of a meeting on Monday. He will have much explaining to do.If Greece is to secure a long-term pact with its creditors by the end of June, Mr. Tsipras will have to abandon most of his election promises. Given his difficulties in delivering on even the short-term pact, there is a temptation to cast around for alternatives.Some members of Syriza want Greece to regain its financial independence by defaulting on its debts and cutting loose from the euro. Meanwhile, pundits like Wolfgang Munchau of The Financial Times want Greece to threaten to default while staying within the single currency and to use that as a tactic to secure a better deal from its creditors.Mr. Tsipras should resist these siren voices. Their advice would lead to disaster.Look first at the option of default combined with leaving the euro. This is superficially attractive because Greece\u2019s debt would be cut to more manageable levels, while bringing back the drachma would allow the country to devalue its currency and lift its competitiveness.The snag is that the transition would be nightmarish. It could be managed only by imposing severe capital controls until the new currency was introduced, a process that would take several months, given the need to jump through political, legal and logistical hoops. Otherwise, the Greek people would merely take their money out of the banks, knowing that their euros would be replaced with devalued drachmas.Capital controls were introduced in Cyprus two years ago when its banks were restructured and are due to be lifted only this month. But if controls were imposed in Greece to coincide with a default, the Cypriot measures would look like a walk in the park.After all, Cyprus did not default on its debt and was working with its creditors toward a mutually acceptable solution. As a result, the European Central Bank flew in piles of cash, people were allowed to take 300 euros, or about $325, a day out of their accounts and companies were able to pay for imports.By contrast, Athens would stop paying its creditors, including not just other eurozone governments but also the E.C.B. It is pie in the sky to suppose that, in such circumstances, the central bank would feed the cash machines or supply liquidity so businesses could bring in vital commodities such as oil and medicines. The economy would sink into a new recession.It is not just that the transition to the drachma would be terrible. The aftermath would also be appalling, because taxes would have plummeted and the newly busted government would not be able to borrow abroad.In such circumstances, a responsible government would tighten its belt, cut spending and run a balanced budget. But what chance is there that Syriza, which was voted in on a promise to increase spending, will do that? Instead, it might take the irresponsible option: printing drachmas to fill the hole in its finances and so fueling inflation and, ultimately, hyperinflation.What, then, about the other supposed Plan B: defaulting while staying in the euro? This would be miserable, too.Such a move would bankrupt the Greek banking system, as it is exposed to the state. Because Athens would no longer be able to get funds from its eurozone partners to recapitalize the banks, the only option would be to \u201cbail in\u201d depositors \u2014 converting a portion of the money in their accounts into shares in the banks, on the lines of what was done in Cyprus. For the duration of such an operation, capital controls would have to be introduced.The government, meanwhile, would have to balance its budget. This would be hard, given that the depositor bail-in plus capital controls would deaden economic activity.The state might, therefore, be tempted to pay salaries, pensions and the like with i.o.u.s. This would be extremely unpopular, as the recipients would view them as worth a fraction of real euros. The i.o.u.s would start to circulate as a parallel currency, trading at a discount to euros and seen as the probable precursor to the reintroduction of drachmas.Given that none of the supposed Plan B\u2019s is any good, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s best bet is to convince his creditors of his good faith and push ahead with vigorous reforms in the hope that they will cut him some slack. If that means breaking with his far-left faction and perhaps calling a new election, so be it. His duty is to the Greek people as a whole.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Under Health Care Act, Many Tax Filers Are Discovering Costly Complications", "Date": "2015-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPITTSBURGH \u2014 When he signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act last fall, J. C. Ciesielski estimated his income at $19,400, qualifying him for a federal subsidy that cut his premiums in half. But Mr. Ciesielski, an actor, earned an extra $2,340 from a voice-over job in December, and that welcome bit of income proved problematic when he did his taxes this month.\u201cThis is definitely the lowest refund I\u2019ve ever gotten,\u201d Mr. Ciesielski, 34, said as he drummed his fingers on the tax preparer\u2019s desk. \u201cBut it boils down to I have health insurance, which I desperately need.\u201dThis filing season, for the first time, millions of Americans are facing tax implications \u2014 and new forms that even seasoned preparers are finding confusing \u2014 related to their health insurance status. The changes are not only complicating things for tax filers, but also costing many of them money.And people who did get insurance but, like Mr. Ciesielski, underestimated their income for 2014 \u2014 the figure on which subsidies are calculated \u2014 are being required to pay back part of their subsidy.The health law prohibits the I.R.S. from imposing criminal fines or putting liens on the property of people who ignore the insurance mandate, but it does allow the agency to collect the penalty by reducing future refunds.\u201cIt will still be on their books,\u201d said Courtenay Murphy, a tax preparer in Gunnison, Colo.H & R Block also found that as of Feb. 24, just over half of its clients with subsidized marketplace coverage had to repay a portion of their subsidy because their 2014 income turned out to be higher than what they estimated when they applied for coverage.Kathy Pickering, executive director of the Tax Institute at H & R Block, said these clients had owed back $530 on average, decreasing their tax refund by an average of 17 percent.\u201cThat\u2019s pretty significant,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shows how difficult it is for someone to estimate their income on a looking-forward basis.\u201d\u201cMany of them know that there\u2019s something bad that happens when they don\u2019t have health insurance, but they\u2019re not quite ready for it,\u201d said Samuel Mudrak, a volunteer tax preparer. \u201cThey\u2019re coming in expecting to get the same refund that they got last year.\u201dThat was the case for Mark Taylor of Carroll, Iowa, who was surprised to owe a $95 fine with his taxes because his wife, Barbara, remained uninsured last year. Other members of his family were fined, too, he said, and some were irate.\u201cI\u2019ve got a cousin, he called me up and said, \u2018How bad did you get socked?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Taylor, 52, said. \u201cWe think it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dNonetheless, in Mr. Taylor\u2019s case, the penalty worked as a nudge: After doing his taxes, he hustled to buy coverage for his wife in order to avoid a much bigger penalty \u2014 at least $325 \u2014 at tax time next year.Others threatened with a penalty have discovered they did not owe one. Josephine Kennedy, for instance, had worked a series of low-paying jobs in 2014 and had gone without health insurance, despite the new Affordable Care Act requirement that most Americans get coverage.\u201cI don\u2019t understand where all of this is coming from,\u201d Ms. Kennedy, 51, said, shaking her head as she waited for a tax preparer at Just Harvest in Pittsburgh to tell how big a penalty she would owe.But Ms. Kennedy, now a housekeeper at a private business club, ended up owing no penalty. With an income of $12,563, she would have qualified for Medicaid if Pennsylvania had expanded the program, an option allowed by the Affordable Care Act, last year. Since it did not, she got an exemption from the penalty.The state has now expanded Medicaid, and Ms. Kennedy said she would apply even though she preferred the free clinic she had gone to for years. If she remains uninsured, she will most likely be subject to the penalty for 2015, which will grow to $325 per adult or 2 percent of household income, whichever is larger.\u201cI still don\u2019t see the point of forcing someone to get insurance,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy I got this taken care of for now.\u201dPeople who learn they have to pay back part of their subsidy after underestimating their 2014 income on their insurance application are equally perplexed. Many saw their circumstances change during the year \u2014 getting a job or a raise as the economy improved, for example. But if they failed to report an income change, they will owe the I.R.S.Mr. Ciesielski, who is on disability, said he would think twice about taking on acting jobs this year to avoid the same predicament when he files his 2015 taxes.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to guess\u201d what his income will be, he said.As if taxpayers were not confused enough, the federal marketplace sent out forms containing inaccurate data to 820,000 people with subsidized insurance policies in January. Marketplace officials said\u00a0Friday\u00a0that they had mailed corrected forms to all but 80,000 of the affected taxpayers, who need them for calculating whether they received an appropriate subsidy.Those who filed their taxes before the mistake was caught \u2014 about 50,000 people, the Obama administration has said \u2014 do not have to refile, but they could lose subsidy money they are owed.Laurel Dickenson of Duluth, Ga., is among those people. She was surprised to learn while doing her taxes that she owed back $600 of her insurance subsidy. Now she is waiting for a corrected form and hoping that she may in fact owe less, even though she got a job after becoming insured last spring and did not report her income change.\u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised,\u201d said Ms. Dickenson, 57, who recently became unemployed again. \u201cBut this is complicated, and it\u2019s affecting people\u2019s lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In Togo, President Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 is lining up to run for a third term in April, and has that race all but sewn up. So, too, does President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan.Africa is such a rich hunting ground for leaders who want to hang around that only a handful of countries have seen presidents try and fail to remove term limits \u2014 notably, Nigeria under Olusegun Obasanjo, Zambia under Frederick Chiluba and Malawi under Bakili Muluzi. In Burkina Faso, in October last year, President Blaise Compaor\u00e9 went too far. After 27 years, he still hadn\u2019t had enough and sought to give himself more years at the top. Angry youths and women wielding wooden spoons ran him out of power and out of town.By contrast, 11 countries \u2014 starting with Burkina Faso back in 1997, and including since then Cameroon, Chad, Gabon, Guinea, Namibia, Niger, Togo, Uganda, Algeria and Djibouti \u2014 have all seen presidential term limits changed or scrapped altogether. At first glance, it seems like familiar African Big Man politics is at play here. It isn\u2019t.Term limits were introduced in the wave of political reforms and economic liberalization across Africa in the 1990s and early 2000s, following the end of the Cold War. Military dictatorships or one-party governments all over the continent fell like dominoes in that period, and the smarter actors adapted and civilianized.The roots of some of the prosperity that has led to the \u201cAfrica rising\u201d mantra today can be traced to the changes in that period. They opened up African countries to international investment, and by introducing term limits, they brought predictability and stability to its politics. These reforms actually worked. Old-style one-party rule is all but dead in Africa. The coups and counter-coups of the past are infrequent. Elections are plentiful. In 2014, across the continent, there were at least 15 national votes. And unprecedentedly, four incumbents lost power and went home, mostly willingly: in Malawi, Mauritius, Tunisia and the semiautonomous Somali territory of Puntland. This year, there will be about 14 or 15 presidential elections. By my count, two will most likely be free, maybe eight half-free, and possibly as many as five stolen outright. Still, for all the shortcomings, those are more elections than took place during the entire course of the 1970s.The very reforms that made these improvements possible, however, created the conditions for reversals. When state-owned companies were privatized, for example, many were sold at favorable prices to businesspeople with links to the governments of the day. Then, nearly every African country established an \u201cinvestment authority,\u201d whose job was to grant incentives like tax holidays and procure industrial land for foreign investors.A result is that the liberalized economies that emerged in Africa were based on systems of patronage. Even though they relied far less on the old command economics of the Cold War era, their success often became dependent on incumbent regimes. The emergent private sector, and new foreign investors, thus developed a vested interest in the continuity of the regimes of the day. Over time, ruling parties also became vulnerable to being toppled by rivals. Back when they still had millions of members, they didn\u2019t use to demand subscription fees. But when they started levying fees, the membership fell away, and party finances suffered.With censorious-eyed foreign donors keeping a watch on government finances, however, it got more difficult to raid Central Bank vaults without provoking funding cutbacks from institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 a form of censure that would, in turn, spook private investors. So political parties turned to friendly businesses for help with their finances. Of Uganda, for example, United Nations researchers recently noted: \u201cIf businesses finance the ruling party they may be promised tax exemptions.\u201dThat explains how we have a situation in which presidents, whose governments are running huge deficits and can\u2019t pay public service salaries, are still able to raise large sums from private-sector allies and buy votes. In the past, if the national treasuries were bankrupt, leaders would be unable to fund campaigns. And because of these free-market reforms, many opposition politicians also became rich, because they, too, were free to do business. Just look, for example, at how the opposition veterans of Kenya, Raila Odinga, and Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, have prospered.Since pork no longer depends exclusively on holding the reins of government, the struggles for political power have actually become less of a life-or-death matter in most of the continent. Since opposition figures are already getting a slice of the pie, the incentive to push back against the Big Men when they tinker with constitutions is reduced. That, in turn, allows incumbents to get away with their term-limit extensions more easily.It is counterintuitive, yes, but for the next few years, the richer Africa gets, the less democratic it will become. I suspect most African voters, though, are happy to go to bed with a full stomach \u2014 rather than with an empty one but a head full of high ideals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Slumping Economy and Bribery Scandal Eat Away at Dilma Rousseff\u2019s Popularity", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 President Dilma Rousseff ran for office declaring that she would harness an oil bonanza in Brazil to supercharge the economy while avoiding the corruption and mismanagement that have plagued other oil-rich countries in the developing world.But less than three months into her second term as president, Ms. Rousseff is fighting for her political survival as Petrobras, the national oil company she oversaw and has championed, reels from a colossal bribery scandal.Public anger over the scandal, and the slumping economy, brought hundreds of thousands of people to the streets of Brazil last weekend demanding Ms. Rousseff\u2019s resignation. On Wednesday, a public opinion survey showed her approval rating at a paltry 13 percent.\u201cDilma Rousseff arrogantly claimed she got it all right when she was overseeing Petrobras, prioritizing oil over biofuels, encouraging the population to consume gasoline by keeping fuel prices low,\u201d said Adriano Pires, a prominent energy consultant. \u201cBut now the shock is here: She got it all wrong, and the entire country is paying for her failed energy policies.\u201dWhile even Ms. Rousseff\u2019s political opponents say that the possibility of her being impeached or resigning remains distant, she is grappling with political and economic crises that are feeding off one another and eroding her authority.In addition to the street protests this month, prominent figures in her own Workers Party have begun criticizing her reluctant embrace of austerity measures sought by her critics in the business establishment.At the same time, centrist leaders in her coalition in Congress are in open revolt against Ms. Rousseff, blaming her for not shielding them from inquiries over their involvement in the Petrobras scandal, raising doubts about whether she can push through unpopular spending cuts.The scandal dwarfs previous corruption cases in Brazil, with the Supreme Court authorizing the investigations of dozens of prominent political figures, including the heads of both houses of Congress. Former Petrobras executives who reached plea deals have described a scheme in which construction companies vying for business with the oil company paid bribes equivalent to about 3 percent of the value of contracts.The scheme was put into motion during a period roughly corresponding to the time when Ms. Rousseff was chairwoman of Petrobras, from 2003 to 2010. At the time, she also served as energy minister and chief of staff to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, her predecessor.No testimony has surfaced indicating that Ms. Rousseff personally profited from the bribery scheme, and she has insisted that she knew nothing about it until investigators revealed it last year.Ms. Rousseff was a forceful presence at Petrobras, a sprawling enterprise founded in 1953, using her influence to expand the role of state-controlled companies and banks in Brazil\u2019s economy.With new legislation, she put Petrobras firmly in control of new deep-sea fields and gave it a nationalist mandate to buy ships, oil platforms and other equipment from struggling Brazilian companies, causing project delays and cost overruns.These strategies were a shift from the 1990s, when Brazil\u2019s government ended Petrobras\u2019s monopoly, exposing the company to market forces while keeping it under state control.The push to build entire domestic industries supplying Petrobras, as well as huge refineries in states controlled by allies of the Workers Party, created thousands of jobs \u2014 until now. The scandal and the worldwide slump in oil prices have caused Petrobras to suspend work on projects like a huge refinery complex in Itabora\u00ed, a city near Rio de Janeiro.The work force at the refinery has dwindled to less than 5,000 from a peak of 35,500 in 2013, according to union officials. Many laborers have returned to their home states in Brazil\u2019s relatively poor northeast, but as many as 200 unemployed workers now live on the streets of Itabora\u00ed, according to F\u00e1bio Krespane, coordinator of the city\u2019s agency for the homeless.Others are squatting in apartment complexes built during the boom years. One of the squatters, Leirson Fabiano Santos, 34, an unemployed heavy machinery supervisor, estimated that 90 percent of the workers had voted for Ms. Rousseff, but added, \u201cI no longer have any good things to say about her.\u201d\u201cNow she wants to raise taxes and energy prices so that we, the masses, pay the price for the corruption at Petrobras,\u201d Mr. Santos said.Ms. Rousseff had kept electricity prices low in recent years to keep inflation from accelerating, before allowing them to rise after she narrowly won re-election in October. Subsidized gasoline prices also wreaked havoc on Brazil\u2019s once-envied ethanol industry by making biofuels costlier, with more than 60,000 jobs lost from 2013 to 2014 from sugar mill closings, according to Unica, a sugar and ethanol trade group.Still, energy experts point out that Brazil has strengths lacking in many other oil-rich countries such as Venezuela, including trusted institutions such as the Federal Police, which revealed the scandal to the nation, and the Supreme Court, which authorized investigations of an array of influential legislators. And a diverse economy, including a cutting-edge agricultural sector and a broad industrial base, reduces the reliance on oil. Petrobras also has technical expertise when it comes to finding and producing oil in complex offshore fields.\u201cDespite all the government meddling and the culture of corruption at the top of the company, Petrobras is still doing quite well on an operating level,\u201d said Cleveland Jones, a geologist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro.Even so, the oil scandal contributing to Brazil\u2019s economic quagmire is fueling a broader re-evaluation of the policies that strengthened the role of state-controlled enterprises under Ms. Rousseff. Even her finance minister, Joaquim Levy, is questioning the wisdom of giving so much power to corruption-plagued companies like Petrobras.\u201cState capitalism doesn\u2019t work very well in a democracy,\u201d Mr. Levy said in a speech to business leaders in S\u00e3o Paulo this week.Taylor Barnes and Vinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As the Economy Awakens, Thoughts Turn to Dream Houses", "Date": "2015-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersSCOTT SELTZER\u2019S beach house in Sagaponack, N.Y., would have been finished in half the time, if not for the screening room. That one room took two years, but Mr. Seltzer, who works in finance, has no regrets.\u201cI lived in small apartments my whole life,\u201d said Mr. Seltzer, 52, who grew up in Queens and now lives in Manhattan. \u201cWhen we were building this house, I said I\u2019d like a screening room. I could watch movies or the news. Then I thought, let\u2019s make this special.\u201dIt was that word \u201cspecial\u201d that doubled the project\u2019s time for one room in his 8,000-square-foot home, taking more time to finish than the spa with the Turkish marble floors or the wine cellar.\u201cWhat most people call screening rooms are glorified dens, with a big television and leather chairs, maybe some stadium seating,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted mine to have a vision. I feel it\u2019s one of the most impressive screening rooms in the country.\u201dThe screening room, which is oval, has a hand-painted ceiling that mixes silver and gold leaf with Swarovski crystals.He declined to say how much the entire project cost, but said he spent $350,000 on the screening room alone. The house was valued for tax purposes at $3 million last year, though the actual value is certainly higher when the renovations and land are factored in.After faltering slightly, luxury building is again booming in the traditionally high-end parts of the country, like South Florida and the Hamptons, as the economy continues to show healthy signs, architects and designers say. But even people with more modest homes in mind are turning their desires into reality. A study to be released next week from Liberty Mutual said that 44 percent of Americans were planning to move or renovate their homes this year.The idea of building a dream home can captivate many people\u2019s imaginations. It allows them to create spaces like screening rooms that are uniquely theirs. There is, after all, only so much you can do with bedrooms and dining rooms.But those grand plans do not always come off smoothly. There are reasons for that and blame to be shared among clients, architects and builders.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for someone who is not trained to get all the subtle nuances of the houses right,\u201d said Campion Platt, an architect and interior designer, who worked with Mr. Seltzer on his home. \u201cIt\u2019s about scale and proportion. Until they see it all assembled, they can be surprised.\u201dThe toughest spaces are not screening rooms, he said, but great rooms, those vast open spaces meant to be the convening spot of a home. \u201cIt has to do with the scale and placement of the furniture,\u201d he said.But people make seemingly smaller mistakes that have larger ramifications. They skimp on lighting and tile, said Shane Inman, an interior designer who specializes in kitchens and baths.And just as bad as having too much furniture in the great room, people don\u2019t allow enough space for a kitchen to be functional. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how many inches they need to walk past something,\u201d Mr. Inman said.To minimize those gaffes that detract from a dream home, many people with means hire a team to help them, such as architects, contractors, craftsmen and landscapers. Finding them is not easy. One option is the famous architect route, picking a Richard Meier or Robert A.M. Stern, the dean of the Yale University School of Architecture. But that is out of reach of all but the wealthiest people, and even those who can afford them need to want a house that matches the architect\u2019s style. Another option is to seek referrals from friends.John Patrick, founder of Above the Fold, a New York talent agency with a focus on home construction, is trying to create a gallery system where he will assemble teams of architects and contractors for people who want to build luxury homes.\u201cThere is not a place for people to make a credible and insightful decision about an architect or interior designer,\u201d he said. \u201cA budget doesn\u2019t dictate whether a building could be iconic. If someone has an intention, they can make it work.\u201dFor many people, channeling that intention comes from finding an architect they have chemistry with. That relationship will keep the project on track and still allow clients to realize their vision.When Robert and Carol Aicher decided to renovate a home they owned in Traverse City, Mich., they were living in New York City, where he was working as a lawyer. They were nervous about the distance, but also concerned about remaking a home they had once co-owned with her sister.They hired Mr. Inman to renovate the house, which sits on a bay. \u201cHe gave us a number at the beginning, and we probably ended up spending 15-20 percent more than that, but mostly because of changes we made,\u201d Mr. Aicher said.Mr. Inman suggested a second-story deck to capture the water view, but also smaller touches like a built-in cutting board that could be flipped over to empty the scraps into a garbage can below. In the laundry room, he put in drying racks that hide away when not in use.\u201cThose details made mundane tasks seamless,\u201d Mr. Aicher said. \u201cThey\u2019re not really ground-shaking, but they\u2019re nice to have.\u201dMr. Aicher would not disclose the cost of the renovation, but said, \u201cfor up here it was a huge amount of money.\u201d Those extra touches are what often drives the price up.\u201cIt always boils down to two things: to money and to how bad you want it,\u201d Mr. Inman said. \u201cI had a client who bought a $20,000 grill. He said, \u2018I just have to have it.\u2019\u201dFor those creating a dream house through renovation and addition, there is, it seems, a fairly direct correlation among authenticity, patience and cost.A house Ms. Sachs worked on for Bob Doyle, who manages country musicians including Garth Brooks, and his wife, Alex von Hoffmann, was on 750 acres outside Nashville. They decided to restore the old part of the house and use wood from other buildings on the property for the interior finishes on the addition.\u201cIt was a recycling of resources that was unusual,\u201d Ms. Sachs said. \u201cIt would have been cheaper for me to knock it all down and buy reclaimed lumber from someone else. It felt irresponsible to them.\u201dIt also took them over three years to finish the job. For most projects that stretch beyond 12 to 18 months, seemingly small changes can ripple through the entire project.\u201cIt\u2019s not like shopping where I return the pair of pants and I get the credit back,\u201d Ms. Sachs said. \u201cThe pants are tied to my foundation, which is tied to my power, which is tied to my A.V. These plans are a tight puzzle: You take one little piece out and there is a big domino effect.\u201dFor a recent interior design project for a 10,000-square-foot house, Mr. Platt\u2019s firm put together a 260-page book of ideas, including ones that would not work. And that was just a first pass.Tony Ingrao, an architect who has worked with celebrities like Kim Cattrall, said first-timers needed to be flexible, above all else.\u201cThe best projects are always a collaboration between the client and the designer,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can push each other, and it goes back and forth, and it\u2019s really fabulous.\u201dMr. Seltzer continues to love his home and his screening room. But he still tinkers. He recently worked with Mr. Platt on a custom-built garbage shed.\u201cThe home can be a layperson\u2019s own art to express who you are,\u201d Mr. Seltzer said. \u201cWe wanted something that was comfortable and inviting, which we have, but not too overly formal. And not too rustic. We wanted something elegant too.\u201dIn other words, a mix of aesthetics that reflects an individual\u2019s taste and preferences.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "George Osborne Offers Tax Breaks to British Voters in Budget Statement", "Date": "2015-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 With British elections approaching, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, used a budget statement on Wednesday to claim credit for the economic recovery and to offer some relief to hard-pressed voters.His statement to Parliament outlining spending plans, a little more than seven weeks before elections on May 7, gave the governing Conservative Party a chance to outline its main policies to voters.\u201cBritain is growing, creating jobs and paying its way,\u201d Mr. Osborne said, adding that the country was \u201cwalking tall again.\u201d His plans represented \u201cone more step on the road from austerity to prosperity,\u201d he said, describing Britain as the \u201ccomeback country\u201d and saying it could eclipse Germany, economically, within 15 years.\u201cIn the last year, we have grown faster than any other major advanced economy in the world,\u201d Mr. Osborne told lawmakers.In an effort to help spread the benefits of recovery, Mr. Osborne announced an increase in the amount that workers can earn before paying income tax, to 11,000 pounds, or about $16,300, from \u00a310,600, by 2017-18. Investors will be able to earn up to \u00a31,000 in interest without having to pay tax on it, he added.Forecasts released by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility in Britain upgraded growth forecasts to 2.5 percent in 2015, and to 2.3 percent for each of the next three years.Behind the rosy picture on growth, there are some problems. The country\u2019s budget deficit of 5.5 percent of gross domestic product is high, as is borrowing. At the same time, low productivity remains a constant, disappointing feature of the British economy.When the economy failed to grow as expected early in his tenure, Mr. Osborne was forced to rethink his deficit-reduction targets and to temper his austerity policies. However, he has promised more spending reductions if the Conservatives win the election.In a pre-budget analysis, Robert Wood, chief Britain economist for Berenberg Bank, predicted small changes. \u201cThe Conservative Party campaign is laser-focused on the economy, on \u2018competence versus chaos,\u2019 as its slogan puts it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt can hardly spray cash around with abandon while also arguing that voters should return a Conservative government because the fiscal job remains unfinished.\u201d\u201cThe room for chunky tax cuts is fictional anyway,\u201d he added. \u201cIt should be emphasized that the government budget deficit is currently running at \u00a390 billion a year.\u201dMr. Osborne\u2019s announcements included a penny off the tax on a pint of beer, a 2 percent reduction of the tax on spirits and most ciders, and a freeze on the tax on wine. Taxes on gasoline would also be frozen, he said.Mr. Osborne promised that the annual paper tax return would be replaced by digital tax accounts, which are devised to be easier to complete. A new plan would be created to help people save for the deposit on their first home, he added.Before the statement to Parliament on Wednesday, Mr. Osborne had announced plans to change the system for pensions, a politically delicate area of policy because retirees are, statistically, more likely to vote than young people.Last year, he scrapped rules that would have forced those who are retiring to convert pension savings into annuities, which guarantee a cash income for life.This year, Mr. Osborne said he would allow those who already had annuities to sell them without facing large tax bills, as they do now.Mr. Osborne also confirmed on Wednesday the introduction of a new 12-sided pound coin.An earlier version of this article misquoted George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer. He said, \u201cIn the last year, we have grown faster than any other major advanced economy in the world,\u201d not \u201cthan any other major economy in the advanced world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Creeps Closer to Higher Rate That May Not Arrive for Months", "Date": "2015-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve on Wednesday moved to the verge of raising interest rates for the first time since the economy fell into recession more than seven years ago, even as officials suggested that the Fed might not pull the trigger until well into the second half of the year.\u201cJust because we removed the word \u2018patient\u2019 from the statement doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to be impatient,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, said at a news conference after the statement\u2019s release. Ms. Yellen said the Fed was not declaring an intention to raise rates in June, \u201calthough we can\u2019t rule that out.\u201dHer remarks suggested that borrowers have a few more months to take advantage of exceptionally low interest rates on mortgages and car loans, while savers face a few more months of exceptionally meager returns on their low-risk investments. And even after the Fed raises its crucial interest rate, borrowing costs may well remain comparatively low well into the future.Investors celebrated like the recipients of a last-minute reprieve.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 1.2 percent to close at 2,099.50. Bond prices also jumped, driving the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond to its largest one-day decline since October. The yield fell 0.13 points to 1.92 percent. Evan A. Schnidman, chief executive of Prattle Analytics, which analyzes central bank communications, said the Fed surprised many investors because the public remarks of Fed officials over the last year have consistently pointed to an earlier start date for rate increases than the Fed\u2019s official statements. \u201cAlthough they are individually eager to normalize policy, they are collectively reticent about the possibility of raising rates prematurely,\u201d Mr. Schnidman said.The march toward higher rates may be slow, but it still looks all but certain to begin at some point this year. That reflects the Fed\u2019s optimism that the economy no longer needs quite as much help from central bank stimulus and a sense of fatigue with the Fed\u2019s long-running campaign to encourage faster economic growth.The current flatness of the curve shows investors expect mediocre growth.Many Americans are still struggling to find good jobs, while the sluggish pace of inflation suggests that the economy still has room to grow more quickly without setting off alarm bells that prices will escalate beyond a comfortable level. The Fed acknowledged in its statement that growth had \u201cmoderated somewhat\u201d in recent months, and that inflation had sagged even further below its 2 percent target, a level most economists consider appropriate to a healthy economy. There are also growing concerns that the stronger dollar, which has been rising partly on expectations that the Fed will raise rates while other central banks are cutting them, will hurt American exports and reduce corporate investment. The rise of the dollar also appears to be worsening the weakness of inflation. Low inflation is a sign of economic weakness and can also be a cause of it, for example, by making it harder to repay debts. The forecasts published by the Fed showed that 15 of the 17 members of the policy-making committee expect to raise the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate this year. Those projections showed that on average they expect two increases, to roughly 0.75 percent. The Fed has held short-term rates near zero since December 2008.\u201cI think some of the headwinds that have long been holding the economy back are beginning to recede,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at her news conference. Monetary policy exerts a gradual influence on economic conditions, so the Fed must anticipate the trajectory of growth when it makes policy. Ms. Yellen said officials were inclined to raise rates because they expected continued improvement in the labor market and a rebound in inflation that would move it closer to its desirable level. In place of its recent promise to remain \u201cpatient\u201d in deciding when to start raising rates, the committee\u2019s statement said that the Fed would act \u201cwhen it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.\u201dThe statement said the Fed \u201cremains unlikely\u201d to act at its next meeting, in April, turning the attention of investors to subsequent meetings. A number of analysts said they viewed the Fed\u2019s September meeting as the most likely date.\u201cWhile the Fed chose to explicitly drop the patient qualifier, the implicit patience remains intact,\u201d Michael Dolega, senior economist at TD Bank, wrote in a note to clients after the release of the statement. \u201cThe Fed does not yet appear to be convinced that the economy can withstand higher interest rates at this point, especially in an environment of weak external demand and a surging dollar.\u201dThe most striking changes on Wednesday were in the Fed\u2019s quarterly economic forecasts. Officials said they now expected economic output to expand 2.3 to 2.7 percent in 2015, a downgrade from their December estimate of 2.6 to 3 percent. Forecasts for 2016 and 2017 were also revised downward, the latest instance in the Fed\u2019s postcrisis pattern of repeatedly reducing its forecasts.Officials also shaved their estimates of inflation. In 2015, they now project, prices will rise 0.6 to 0.8 percent, and then 1.7 to 1.9 percent in 2016. Most consequentially, officials reduced their estimates of the lowest level of unemployment that is consistent with stable inflation. The average forecast of 5 to 5.2 percent was significantly lower than the December average of 5.2 to 5.5 percent and almost as low as the precrisis average. The changes reflected the reality that the unemployment rate has already reached the top of the old range without any evident sign of faster wage growth. In keeping with these forecasts, Fed officials also pushed back their expectations about the timing and the pace of interest rate increases. After rates reach 0.75 percent by the end of this year, officials expect them to hit just 2 percent by the end of 2016.The changes move the Fed\u2019s outlook closer to the expectations priced into bond markets in recent months, rewarding investors who bet that the Fed was again allowing its hopes to get ahead of the economic data. \u201cIt is now clear the bond market is not moving toward the Fed; the Fed is moving toward the bond market,\u201d wrote Tim Duy, a professor of economics at the University of Oregon and a close watcher of the Fed. \u201cBy moving toward the markets on the path of rate hikes, the Fed acknowledges that they are eager to let this recovery run on.\u201dAlongside the debate about the timing of rate increases, there is growing concern that whenever the Fed moves, it will disrupt financial markets. At a minimum, The Fed is on track to be the first major central bank to start raising interest rates, and it is also intentionally introducing greater uncertainty. Wednesday\u2019s statement represented the end of the Fed\u2019s crisis-era practice of providing explicit guidance about its plans for interest rates.In a note to clients last week, the hedge fund manager Ray Dalio cautioned that if the Fed did tighten too soon, it would have little ability to correct the mistake because it has already exhausted the standard arsenal of monetary policy. \u201cWe don\u2019t know \u2014 nor does the Fed know \u2014 exactly how much tightening will knock over the apple cart,\u201d Mr. Dalio said in the note, which made the rounds on Wall Street because of his prominence and its unusually foreboding tone. \u201cWhat we do hope the Fed knows, which we don\u2019t know, is how exactly it will fix things if it knocks it over.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Euro-Skeptics Rally as Hope Holds Its Own", "Date": "2015-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeLONDON \u2014 The latest episode of Greece\u2019s debt crisis has revived doubts about the long-term survival of the euro, nowhere more so than in London, Europe\u2019s main financial center and a hotbed of euro-skepticism.The heightened risk of a Greek default and/or exit comes just as there are signs that the eurozone is turning the corner after seven years of financial and economic crisis and that its perilous internal imbalances may be starting to diminish.To skeptics, the election of a radical leftist-led government in Athens that is committed to tearing up Greece\u2019s bailout agreement looks like the start of an unraveling of the 19-nation currency union, with southern countries rebelling against austerity while the European Union\u2019s paymaster, Germany, rebels against further aid.A last-ditch deal to extend Greece\u2019s bailout for four months \u2014 after much kicking and screaming between Athens and Berlin \u2014 did little to ease fears that the eurozone\u2019s weakest link may end up defaulting on its European creditors. An aphorism of the American economist Milton Friedman \u2014 \u201cWhat is unsustainable will not be sustained\u201d \u2014 is cited by those who believe market forces will eventually overwhelm the political will that holds the euro together.Countries that share a currency cannot devalue when their economies lose competitiveness, as occurred in southern Europe in the first decade of the euro\u2019s existence. And in the eurozone, there is no mechanism for large fiscal transfers between member states.So the only option has been a wrenching \u201cinternal devaluation\u201d by countries on the periphery of the euro area, involving real wage, pension and public spending cuts and mass unemployment, causing deep social distress.Austerity has fueled radical forces of political protest and may be running out of democratic road \u2014 not just in Greece \u2014 but none of the alternative ways out of the eurozone\u2019s economic divergence dilemma looks remotely plausible.\u201cThe history of the gold standard tells us that an asymmetric adjustment process involving internal devaluation in debtor countries, with no corresponding inflation in the core, is unlikely to be economically or politically sustainable,\u201d the economic historians Kevin O\u2019Rourke and Alan Taylor wrote in The Journal of Economic Perspectives in 2013. \u201cWhat is desirable for the eurozone may not be feasible.\u201dGermany has so far been unwilling to accept higher inflation, debt forgiveness, issuing common eurozone bonds or cross-border fiscal transfers. There is scant support for closer political and economic integration of the euro area. \u201cThe strategy of the eurozone has been to wait for something to turn up,\u201d said a senior figure in the British financial establishment who has observed the eurozone crisis from up close. \u201cIn the 1930s, World War II turned up. Maybe something else will turn up.\u201dThe European Central Bank has acted at key moments to hold the eurozone together, vowing in 2012 to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the currency and now launching a massive program of buying government bonds in an effort to spur the economy and avert deflation.Central bank action can only buy time for governments to implement structural economic reforms that could close the competitiveness gap by raising potential growth over time. But countries like France and Italy largely failed to use that breathing space in 2013-14 to shake up their labor markets and pension and welfare systems. Yet things can go right as well as wrong.A nascent cyclical recovery in the eurozone, aided by lower oil prices, a weaker euro and central bank money-printing, may narrow the imbalances that have led skeptics to predict the euro\u2019s demise.Ireland and Spain, which have been through the wringer of austerity programs and structural reforms in return for European assistance, are now the fastest-growing economies in the currency bloc. Portugal, too, is perking up.German wages are rising faster than prices, giving a lift to consumer spending and raising the prospect that inflation in the bloc\u2019s biggest economy may outpace the rate in southern Europe for several years. That would make economic adjustment more symmetrical, and less agonizing for the south.There are also signs that France and Italy, the eurozone\u2019s second- and third-largest economies, are finally tackling some of the economic reforms that politicians long feared to touch, albeit at a slow and gradual pace.In France, the government of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has just rammed through a bill to loosen some shackles on business, like a prohibition on Sunday store openings, and plans new steps to ease labor regulation.The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, has introduced a jobs act to ease hiring and firing and is making progress on reform to streamline Parliament and the electoral system.\u201cSpain shows that reform is possible to create a growth environment and significant job creation,\u201d said Luigi Speranza, co-head of European economics at BNP Paribas bank in London. \u201cThe return of growth could make it easier for Renzi to make reforms in Italy, and Hollande in France.\u201dThe European Commission\u2019s budget leniency for Paris and Rome may assist that process by rewarding them for planned growth-enhancing reforms with more time to cut their deficits and debt.Another encouraging sign is that lending to businesses in Italy and Spain is picking up following last year\u2019s central bank stress tests of European banks, and their interest rates are falling, narrowing the gap with the eurozone core.A Greek default or exit from the eurozone \u2014 whether by accident or intention \u2014 could shatter that returning trust, even though Athens accounts for just 2 percent of the bloc\u2019s economy. So Greece\u2019s fate remains entwined with the euro\u2019s survival.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Military Budget Increasing 10% for 2015, Official Says", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese military budget for 2015 will be about 10 percent bigger than last year\u2019s, a senior Chinese official said on Wednesday, meaning that such spending is growing at a pace faster than the overall growth rate of the Chinese economy.The estimate was given in Beijing by Fu Ying, a veteran diplomat who is the spokeswoman for the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s legislature, whose annual meeting begins this week. Ms. Fu said at a news conference that the military budget\u2019s precise numbers would be announced Thursday, along with other budget outlays that will later be formally approved by the legislature.China\u2019s \u201cdefense budget increases have always outpaced the growth in G.D.P.,\u201d said Richard A. Bitzinger\u200b, a senior fellow at \u200bthe S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore\u200b who has studied China\u2019s military spending patterns.\u201cBut this is the first time when the gap could be really, really big,\u201d Mr. Bitzinger said. \u201cThat is, if the economy only grows by, say, 6 percent, but the defense budget grows by 10 percent, that\u2019s a really sizable difference. It demonstrates that the Chinese leadership is committed to increasing defense spending, no matter what.\u201dMilitary experts say China\u2019s actual military budget is almost certainly higher than the official number, but still far less than that of the United States.China\u2019s military expansion is generally consistent with its economic growth and the size of its economy, which is the second largest in the world and is expected to soon surpass that of the United States. Nevertheless, China\u2019s increasingly powerful military and its modernization are alarming other Asian nations, many of which have come into diplomatic conflict with China in recent years over territorial disputes in regional seas.Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines are among those most concerned, as is the United States, which is the pre-eminent military power in Asia. The United States has said that in general, it takes no sides in territorial disputes but wants to maintain stability and freedom of navigation in the region.Xu Guangyu, a retired People\u2019s Liberation Army major general who is now a senior consultant at the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association in Beijing, said by telephone that the estimated 10 percent increase was in line with China\u2019s economic growth and security needs. He said increases of a similar magnitude would continue for years to come.\u201cPer capita, China\u2019s military spending remains too low, only about $57,000 for each member of the military forces in 2014,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s far lower than Japan or the United States.\u201dHe added that China\u2019s relatively large increases in spending were likely to continue for another decade or more. \u201cFor some time into the future, the rises will continue at a level higher than rises in Western countries,\u201d he said. \u201cUp until, I would estimate, average spending for each member of the military reaches levels similar to Japan\u2019s.\u201dPhillip C. Saunders, an Asia military analyst at the National Defense University in Washington, said in an email exchange before the Wednesday announcement that, among other things, it was important to compare the growth in the military budget to the growth in total government expenditure to see whether the army was getting more support than other agencies. China is expected to release overall government budget figures during the congress this week.On Wednesday, Ms. Fu, the legislative spokeswoman, said the 10 percent military budget increase \u201cis on the same level as the growth rate of the budget for the central government and central-level government agencies. The overall level of national armaments is still lacking, and it will take time.\u201dIn recent years, much of China\u2019s military modernization has been concentrated on its navy. Besides mapping out possible conflicts over territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas, many senior military officers are still focused on potential war scenarios over Taiwan, the self-governing island that China considers part of its territory.As part of a longstanding mandate, the United States government on occasion approves arms sales to Taiwan, to which China strongly objects. Some foreign military analysts say the Obama administration is likely to approve new sales soon.At the news conference, Ms. Fu talked broadly about a range of policy issues and gave the military budget estimate after being asked by a foreign journalist. Ms. Fu was particularly interested in underscoring the Chinese leaders\u2019 commitment to battling corruption. Since taking power in late 2012, Xi Jinping, the president and party leader, has led a wide anticorruption campaign that has, among other things, resulted in investigations of some of his most powerful political enemies.Among those under investigation is Maj. Gen. Guo Zhenggang, son of Guo Boxiong, the retired vice chairman of the Central Military Commission. Mr. Xi has already placed under investigation Xu Caihou, another retired vice chairman of the commission, and now there is speculation about whether Guo Boxiong is next.Dr. Saunders said the increase in military spending could result in greater pay for officers as part of the effort to combat corruption in the military.Edward Wong reported from Beijing, and Chris Buckley from Hong Kong. Michael Forsythe contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Mia Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ethiopia, Long Mired in Poverty, Rides an Economic Boom", "Date": "2015-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAddis Ababa JournalADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia \u2014 The bulldozers, tractors and cranes are busy day and night, paving new roads, building tall glass buildings and constructing a new light rail system to stitch together the city\u2019s ends.In less than five years, the city\u2019s skyline has changed drastically. Above the dust, in a seven-story building overlooking Meskel Square, sits Abiy Gebeyehu, a real estate development manager at the Sunshine Construction Company. He is going through files and figures, looking down at the spot where Ethiopia\u2019s former communist dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, once smashed to the ground three bottles of what was supposedly blood as a warning to his opponents.\u201cThe government changed its policy,\u201d Mr. Gebeyehu said, explaining how his company became part of Ethiopia\u2019s economic growth. \u201cThey are engaging private business.\u201dOnce the epitome of poverty and hunger, Ethiopia is changing. Three decades after a famine that prompted America\u2019s top singers to respond with \u201cWe Are the World,\u201d Ethiopia has had an average economic growth rate of 10 percent for over a decade and has met or is coming close to meeting several important Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations, according to the World Bank.Some economists have called Ethiopia an \u201cAfrican lion,\u201d mimicking the success stories of Asia\u2019s economic tigers, and the government here has an ambitious plan to make Ethiopia a middle-income country by 2025.It sometimes seems that everything here in the capital is under construction. Head out on one road in the morning and you might find it blocked off for a development project by evening. The thumping of jackhammers, the sight of men in orange vests, and the comments of Ethiopians who are at once infuriated by the inconvenience and impressed with their country\u2019s transformation are constant.But critics of Ethiopia\u2019s economic growth story point to human rights abuses (some carried out in the name of economic development) and the lack of genuine democracy, and they question the sustainability of the nation\u2019s economic path.By no means has Addis Ababa eliminated the problems found in many developing capitals. Tin houses in shanty neighborhoods can still be seen around town, electricity cuts are common, the Internet is frustratingly slow and telecommunications are largely not reliable.\u201cThe overall performance,\u201d however, said Guang Z. Chen, the World Bank\u2019s country director here, \u201cremains impressive.\u201dThere are many reasons for the boom, but analysts attribute part of the growth to the idea of \u201cthe developmental state,\u201d championed by former Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in his writings, as the framework in which the current economy functions.Following the examples of countries like South Korea and China, he said, the government is heavily involved in the economy, directing the private sector. It has expanded in the areas of services, public investment, infrastructure, education and health by borrowing heavily from state-owned banks and effectively managing foreign development aid from the United States, Britain and other parts of Europe.\u201cOur struggle is to fight poverty,\u201d said Haji Gendo, a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. \u201cWe are targeting specific sectors.\u201dRemittances from the large Ethiopian diaspora and private investment from countries like China, India, Turkey, Sweden and Britain \u2014 attracted to the country\u2019s low-cost labor market and proximity to Europe \u2014 have also contributed to the growing economy, especially in the textile and leather industries.In an industrial zone on the outskirts of the capital, one of many throughout the country, Pittards, a British leather company, is manufacturing and exporting \u201cMade in Ethiopia\u201d gloves that include work gloves sold at Costco retailers in the United States and fashion gloves worn in Paris and Tokyo.\u201cEthiopia was a natural choice,\u201d said Reg Hankey, Pittards\u2019s chief executive, citing the availability of raw materials, labor and proximity to global markets.Back in the lobby of Sunshine Construction, where a banner displays the company\u2019s slogan, \u201cSeeing Is Believing,\u201d models of apartment complexes, villas, and new buildings and photographs of road construction adorn the place. Many of these buildings house government offices or are bought by Ethiopians returning from abroad.But the development projects that are part of a government master plan to expand the capital into areas outside the city have bred anger and clashes, as well.Last year, protests led to the deaths of at least nine students. And in other parts of the country, the displacement and relocations of populations for dam and big agriculture projects have also stirred discontent.\u201cWhile Ethiopia needs development, the government\u2019s approach to development leaves no room for dissent or opposition to government policies,\u201d said Felix Horne, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. \u201cThroughout the country, citizens are routinely displaced for development projects, and there is little consultation or compensation given for the loss of their lands.\u201dThe World Bank itself has come under fire for aiding the government despite such abuses. In the Gambella region, residents complained that they were forced off their ancestral lands by the government under the pretext of improving basic services.But in a sleight of hand, residents said, they were moved to places with infertile ground, no schools and no clinics, while their own lands were leased off to investors.Ethiopia\u2019s economic growth comes as its strategic, geopolitical role remains critical.An ally in the American fight against radical Islam in the region, Ethiopia hosts an American military base; is an island of relative stability in a tough neighborhood that includes Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia; and has largely been spared the type of terrorist attacks that have struck Kenya. The country has been able to turn its relative stability into diplomatic capital, hosting international peace talks for neighboring countries.\u201cWe no longer have war,\u201d said a cabdriver as he zigzagged his blue Soviet-made Lada through a traffic jam, explaining the roots of the economic boom as he passed a construction site.Still, critics say the government is dominated by members of the Tigre ethnic group, does not tolerate dissent and manages a surveillance program to keep dissidents in check.Elections are scheduled for this year, and Parliament is dominated by the governing Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front. Only one seat belongs to a member of the opposition.\u201cWe have elections every five years, it is a multiparty state, but the practice is authoritarian,\u201d Mr. Dori said. \u201cAnd the opposition is in shackles.\u201dLast year, six bloggers and three journalists critical of government policies were arrested and charged with terrorism and connections to an outlawed United States-based opposition group that the government said was plotting attacks to overthrow it.\u201cI am not happy about the human rights situation in Ethiopia today,\u201d said a lawyer for the bloggers, Ameha Mekonnen. \u201cIt is not uncommon to hear from detainees that torture is undergoing in many detentions centers.\u201dSome economists question how long Ethiopia\u2019s model of state-driven capitalism can be sustained.\u201cThis kind of economic model has worked very well for Ethiopia,\u201d said Mr. Chen of the World Bank. \u201cThe question is, can you continue this model unchanged over the next 10 years? Our argument is no.\u201dBeyond that, many here debate whether development and democracy are necessarily interlinked.\u201cIf people are hungry, they will not think of democracy or anything; they need bread,\u201d said Mr. Gendo, the ministry spokesman.Mr. Mekonnen, the lawyer, thought differently.\u201cIf there is confidence between the government and the people, that would be better for development,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is that kind of trust, I am afraid.\u201dThe Addis Ababa Journal article on Wednesday, about Ethiopia\u2019s booming economy and the government\u2019s efforts to make Ethiopia a middle-income country by 2025, misstated part of the name of the governing party. It is the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front, not the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Party.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Birth of a Freedom Anthem", "Date": "2015-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionFew Americans could have missed the significance of these four words. Since the early 1960s, \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d had served as the unofficial anthem of the civil rights movement. Protesters sang the song during the 1963 March on Washington, the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer campaign and the demonstrations in Selma. As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. watched the broadcast in a Selma living room, a tear ran down his cheek. And yet encapsulated in this famous song is a story that escaped many Americans then, and that continues to escape many today, one that should not be lost as we commemorate the golden era of the civil rights movement.\u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d has roots in the antebellum period, when slaves sang \u201cNo More Auction Block,\u201d a spiritual with a similar message and tune. By the late 19th century, black churchgoers across the South embraced \u201cI\u2019ll Be All Right,\u201d a song almost identical in rhythm and melody to the civil rights anthem. And in 1900 a black Methodist minister, Charles Albert Tindley, published a hymn titled \u201cI\u2019ll Overcome Some Day,\u201d which included the line, \u201cIf in my heart, I do not yield, I\u2019ll o-vercome some day.\u201d But \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d antecedents weren\u2019t confined to black churches. In the first half of the 20th century, Southern labor activists took them up, too. When coal mine operators in Birmingham, Ala., proposed a wage cut in 1908, more than 10,000 black and white members of District 20 of the United Mine Workers defied the dictates of segregation and the heavy hand of company guards and state troops and staged a two-month strike. Although the union was defeated, the laborers sustained themselves throughout their ordeal by singing \u201cWe Will Overcome Some Day.\u201d \u201cDear Brothers,\u201d one miner entreated in 1909, \u201clet us not drop that old song, but still sing it. If we stick together we will overcome some day.\u201d His prediction was tested four decades later in Charleston, S.C., when 1,100 black and white employees of the American Tobacco Company cigar factory struck for higher pay and better working conditions. For five cold and rainy months starting in October 1945, the picketers, most of whom were African-American women, marched from dawn until dusk. Each night Lucille Simmons, a black laborer with a captivating alto voice, led the protesters in singing \u201cI Will Overcome,\u201d a later version of \u201cI\u2019ll Be All Right,\u201d to boost morale. Along the way, strikers crafted new verses \u2014 \u201cwe will win our rights,\u201d \u201cwe will win this fight,\u201d \u201cwe will overcome\u201d \u2014 that gave the song still greater collective and political meaning. The tobacco strike ended in March 1946 with the protesters\u2019 gaining modest concessions. Not long after, a few participants, including an African-American woman named Anna Lee Bonneau, traveled to the Highlander Folk School in the rolling foothills of southeastern Tennessee, where they shared their song with the school\u2019s white music director, Zilphia Horton. Co-founded in 1932 by Ms. Horton\u2019s husband, Myles, Highlander brought union organizers together for interracial residential workshops. Zilphia made music a staple of the curriculum and, over the next decade, she taught \u201cWe Will Overcome\u201d to countless labor and civil rights activists, among them the folk singer Pete Seeger, who changed its chorus and title to \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d During Highlander\u2019s 25th anniversary celebration in 1957, Seeger performed the song for King, who remarked the following day, \u201cThat song really sticks with you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Three years later, Guy Carawan, a white California folklorist who succeeded Zilphia Horton as Highlander\u2019s music director, introduced \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d to members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee at their founding meeting in Raleigh, N.C. The song spread quickly, its redemptive message ringing out from picket lines, Freedom Rides and jail cells. It became the \u201cMarseillaise\u201d of the civil rights movement. The story of \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d illuminates the rich history of the black freedom struggle. The movement did not, as popular memory would have it, begin in 1954 with Brown v. Board of Education and end when Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act on Aug. 6, 1965. Nor were its proponents focused solely on civil and political discrimination. Instead, the civil rights movement built on a vibrant interracial unionism that had challenged the South\u2019s low-wage economy for a half century. This \u201clong civil rights movement,\u201d as historians call it, intertwined issues of race and class, insisting that economic disenfranchisement was neither separate from, nor less important than, political disenfranchisement.This is not to minimize the significance of the Voting Rights Act. Indeed, in light of recent efforts to restrict black access to the polls \u2014 abetted by the 2013 Supreme Court decision that freed some states to change their voting laws without federal approval \u2014 celebrating, and defending, this measure seems more important than ever. But an accurate rendering of the civil rights movement must include more than victories like the Voting Rights Act. From the coal fields of Birmingham to the foothills of Tennessee to the streets of Selma, those who sang \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d sought rights and opportunities that extended far beyond the ballot box. Johnson said as much in his 1965 speech when he observed, \u201cEven if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.\u201d In our era of rising economic inequality, racial polarization and hostility to organized labor \u2014 when 27 percent of African-Americans live in poverty \u2014 it is important to remember everything that earlier protesters fought to overcome. Only then will we see contemporary struggles for economic justice, such as fast-food workers\u2019 demands for a higher minimum wage and union rights, as part of a century-old civil rights movement. Only then will we hear the movement\u2019s signature song not just as a source of reassurance, a comforting reminder of toppled barriers and laws overturned, but as a call to action against the problems that remain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Partying Like It\u2019s 1995", "Date": "2015-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySix years ago, Paul Ryan, who has since become the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the G.O.P.\u2019s leading voice on matters economic, had an Op-Ed article published in The Times. Under the headline \u201cThirty Years Later, a Return to Stagflation,\u201d he warned that the efforts of the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve to fight the effects of financial crisis would bring back the woes of the 1970s, with both inflation and unemployment high.True, not all Republicans agreed with his assessment. Many asserted that we were heading for Weimar-style hyperinflation instead.Needless to say, those warnings proved totally wrong. Soaring inflation never materialized. Job creation was sluggish at first, but more recently has accelerated dramatically. Far from seeing a rerun of that \u201970s show, what we\u2019re now looking at is an economy that in important respects resembles that of the 1990s. To be sure, there are big differences between America in 2015 and America in the \u201990s. TV is much better now, the situation of workers much worse. While stocks are high and there is talk of a new technology bubble, there\u2019s nothing like the old euphoria. There is also, unfortunately, no sign that the great productivity surge of 1995-2005, brought on as businesses adopted information technology, is coming back.Still, we\u2019re now adding jobs at a rate not seen since the Clinton years. And it goes without saying that low inflation combined with rapid job growth makes nonsense of all those predictions that Obamacare, or maybe just the president\u2019s bad attitude, would destroy the private sector. But pointing out yet again just how wrong the usual suspects on the right have been about, well, everything isn\u2019t the only reason to note parallels with the 1990s. There are also implications for monetary policy: Recent job gains have brought the Fed to a fork in the road very much like the situation it faced circa 1995. Now, as then, job growth has taken the official unemployment rate down to a level at which, according to conventional wisdom, the economy should be overheating and inflation should be rising. But now, as then, there is no sign of the predicted inflation in the actual data.The Fed has a so-called dual mandate \u2014 it\u2019s supposed to achieve both price stability and full employment. At this point price stability is conventionally taken to mean low but positive inflation, at around 2 percent a year. What does it mean to achieve full employment? For the Fed, it means reaching the Nairu \u2014 the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, which is consistent with that inflation target. The Fed currently estimates the Nairu at between 5.2 percent and 5.5 percent, and the latest report puts the actual unemployment rate at 5.5 percent. So we\u2019re there \u2014 time to raise interest rates!Or maybe not. The Nairu is supposed to be the unemployment rate at which the economy overheats and an inflationary spiral starts to kick in. But there is no sign of inflationary pressure. In particular, if the job market really were tight, wages would be rising quickly, whereas they are in fact going nowhere.The thing is, we\u2019ve been here before. In the early-to-mid 1990s, the Fed generally estimated the Nairu as being between 5.5 percent and 6 percent, and by 1995, unemployment had already fallen to that level. But inflation wasn\u2019t actually rising. So Fed officials made what turned out to be a very good choice: They held their fire, waiting for clear signs of inflationary pressure. And it turned out that the United States\u2019 economy was capable of generating millions more jobs, without inflation, than it would have if the Fed had reined in the boom too soon.Are we in a similar situation now? Actually, I don\u2019t know \u2014 but neither does the Fed. The question, then, is what to do in the face of that uncertainty, with no inflation problem yet in sight.To me, as to a number of economists \u2014 perhaps most notably Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary \u2014 the answer seems painfully obvious: Don\u2019t yank away that punch bowl, don\u2019t pull that rate-hike trigger, until you see the whites of inflation\u2019s eyes. If it turns out that the Fed has waited a bit too long, inflation might overshoot 2 percent for a while, but that wouldn\u2019t be a great tragedy. But if the Fed moves too soon, we might end up losing millions of jobs we could have had \u2014 and in the worst case, we might end up sliding into a Japanese-style deflationary trap, which has already happened in Sweden and possibly in the eurozone.What\u2019s worrisome is that it\u2019s not clear whether Fed officials see it that way. They need to heed the lessons of history \u2014 and the relevant history here is the 1990s, not the 1970s. Let\u2019s party like it\u2019s 1995; let the good, or at least better, times keep rolling, and hold off on those rate hikes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Merkel Warns That Greece Will Receive Aid Only if Reforms Are Met", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 With Greece rapidly running out of money and again teetering on the edge of default, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said Friday that the Greeks would receive a desperately needed financial aid payment only after creditors approved a package of reform measures that the Greek government has promised to send them soon.Her warning, delivered at a summit meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels, came as Greece managed to scrape together enough money to pay around 2 billion euros ($2.17 billion) in debts that were due on Friday. That included a \u20ac350 million payment (about $375 million) to the International Monetary Fund.Greek officials have indicated that the country could meet its obligations for March, but they have been able to offer few certainties beyond that.Greece made a deal on Feb. 20 with the finance ministers of its European Union partners to extend its $257 billion bailout package by four months, to June. But the creditors are withholding $7.5 billion in aid until Greece provides a list of measures to increase tax revenue, contain spending and overhaul the economy that they find satisfactory.Ms. Merkel and other European leaders have been growing increasingly impatient with what they see as foot-dragging by the Greek government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who won office campaigning against the harsh austerity measures demanded by the creditors.Mr. Tsipras met on the sidelines of the summit meeting with Ms. Merkel, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank. Afterward, Ms. Merkel, the leader of Europe\u2019s biggest economy and its main decision maker on policy toward Greece, told reporters in Brussels that Mr. Tsipras had promised to submit the list of overhaul measures \u201cquickly, because the situation obviously is one where trust is needed urgently.\u201dMr. Tsipras told reporters that \u201cwe are more optimistic after this deliberation.\u201d But he did not commit to a specific date to deliver the list, saying that \u201cdeadlines only create more pressure.\u201dWith the Greek economy on the verge of tumbling back into recession, the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, offered a small palliative. He said in Brussels on Friday that about $2.2 billion in unused European Union development funds would be made available to Greece to help it address its \u201chumanitarian crisis.\u201d\u201dThis will not be used to fill Greece\u2019s coffers, but to support efforts to create growth and social cohesion in Greece,\u201d especially youth unemployment, Mr. Juncker said.Between now and June, Greece is obliged to make an additional $3 billion in payments to the monetary fund and will have to refinance nearly $9.7 billion in short-term debt that is coming due. Otherwise, the prospect looms that Greece may have to drop out of the shared euro currency, touching off a crisis not only in Greece but across Western Europe.Mr. Tsipras is scheduled to meet with Ms. Merkel in Berlin on Monday, when he visits Germany for the first time since taking office in January. Greek-German relations have grown caustic since then, with German officials insisting that Greece stick to its commitments and Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government blaming German-led austerity demands for Greece\u2019s economic woes.Other European leaders have generally lined up with Germany\u2019s demands for prompt action by Greece to satisfy its creditors.President Hollande of France echoed Ms. Merkel\u2019s tough line, saying that the talks with Mr. Tsipras had focused on \u201cthe necessity of Greece to deliver the reforms that are expected of it.\u201d He ruled out any revision of the February deal, describing it as \u201cthe right process, the right path to find a solution for Greece.\u201dAnd Alexander Stubb, the prime minister of Finland, said Greece had \u201cno chance, absolutely\u201d of getting any further money from Europe unless it first delivered on its February promises.Andrew Higgins and James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

When the furnaces cool, they crack, and the cost of repairing and restarting them could run to a prohibitive $1 billion or more. Those in the business like to say that a coking plant can be shut down only once.\u201cWe are like a shark,\u201d said Mr. Magomedov, an economist by training. \u201cIt has to swim all the time because if it stops, it drowns. We are the same. We always have to be working.\u201dNo hiding place above ground guarantees safety at the plant, a sprawling 52-year-old behemoth that produces blast-furnace coke, the fuel used in Ukraine\u2019s steel mills, as well as dozens of chemical products, electricity and heat, along with an acrid stench that stays in clothing for days.After repeated attacks at the plant, rain pours through a gaping hole in the machine-room roof. Mortar rounds have slammed into the coke ovens that heat coal at a temperature of more than 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (about 1,000 degrees Celsius). One rocket strike nearly obliterated a turbine crucial to production. Another ruptured a gas pipe, igniting a nine-hour blaze that Mr. Magomedov still seems surprised he was able to extinguish.\u201cYou can\u2019t wait until tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t wait until they stop shooting. We wait a few moments and then we act. To extinguish the fires, plug the gaps, replace power sources. And you keep going until you fix all the holes.\u201dThe plant is critically important to Ukraine and its efforts to revive an ailing economy. Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk has named the factory a strategic asset for Ukraine\u2019s ailing economy.\u201cThey are purposely bombing Avdiivka in order to destroy the coking plant, to stop the Mariupol factories,\u201d Mr. Yatsenyuk said during a news conference broadcast on national television last month. \u201cTo leave 30,000 people without work and to provoke a social explosion, to leave us as a government without currency.\u201dPolitical views within the factory are mixed. Many workers, hailing from territory controlled by the separatist Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and with family still living there, sympathize with the separatists. Others, including some top managers like Mr. Magomedov, favor the government.But the plant, owned by Rinat Akhmetov, once Ukraine\u2019s richest man, continues to pay salaries and is a lifeline for the thousands who work there, so politics takes a back seat.Fearing what they call response fire, the workers have opposed placing artillery positions near the plant or the town of Avdiivka, which is in the throes of a humanitarian crisis.Despite the danger of shelling and extensive damage, the factory is considered one of the safest places in the area. Because roads to the plant are contested and the nearby towns where workers live lack electricity and water, nearly 2,000 employees are living on the factory grounds, sleeping on cots just a few feet from where they work.Four of the five workers who died amid the shelling were on roads near the plant or in the city of Avdiivka. But there have been many close calls.Anna Skvortsova, a personnel director, grew up in Avdiivka. But for the last several months she has been living in the factory\u2019s Soviet-era nuclear bomb shelter, which has been converted into an office and living space. As bomb shelters go, it is surprisingly cheerful, with good lighting, a bank of computers with access to the Internet and plans for a new heating system.Ms. Skvortsova and a colleague, also named Anna, work in a concrete-walled boiler room. Earlier, they traveled occasionally to Avdiivka to see if their apartments had been damaged. Now, the trip of several miles into town, even under the cease-fire negotiated last month, is too dangerous.The two moved into the bomb shelter when two shells crashed through the roof of their office on the second floor of the factory\u2019s administrative building. Ms. Skvortsova, who had just left the room to speak with a colleague, was thrown to the ground by the explosion. If she had been at her desk, she said, she would have been killed.\u201cI didn\u2019t see it; I felt it,\u201d she said, still shaken by the experience. \u201cI was only saved by a miracle.\u201dNearly every worker at the factory has a similar story. Nikolay Skhadyak, 39, was pouring superheated coal from the ovens into a transfer cart when mortar rounds began falling about 100 yards away. It was the third time he had been under fire.When asked why he did not quit on the spot, Mr. Skhadyak gave a familiar answer.\u201cHow can I not work? I have to feed my family,\u201d he said, sitting soot-faced in an aging control booth that glides back and forth among the ovens. Through a window, an open coking furnace, a 20-foot-high maw of fire, appeared to sail by.\u201cThere is no way out,\u201d Mr. Skhadyak said. \u201cAnd there is no work anywhere else in the chemical business.\u201dEvery other major factory in Avdiivka has closed, and other coking plants in the region have either stopped or are producing a tenth of their normal output.Since the bombing began, 600 workers have quit or taken extended leave, while 324 others agreed to come in periodically, receiving two-thirds salaries, Mr. Magomedov said.But thousands more stayed on full time. They did so for their salaries, for their safety, or out of fealty to the plant.Pavel Zhelavy, a grizzled foreman, has been working at the plant for 36 years, since he was 24. When he planned to retire, he was asked to stay on as an adviser because of his knowledge of the coking process.He was moving in earlier this month, carrying a folding cot into the administration building.\u201cThere are two reasons I\u2019m moving in. First, I\u2019m almost always needed here. Second, because it\u2019s cold in my house,\u201d he joked. He had moved his family away from danger to an apartment in Berdyansk, well behind the lines. But now he needed the money to pay the rent.His two brothers live near Donetsk. He said he had not seen them since the fighting began because he had not crossed the front lines.\u201cWe don\u2019t need a cease-fire,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need peace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Ellen Pao\u2019s Suit vs. Kleiner Perkins, World of Venture Capital Is Under Microscope", "Date": "2015-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Speak up \u2014 but don\u2019t talk too much. Light up the room \u2014 but don\u2019t overshadow others. Be confident and critical \u2014 but not cocky or negative.Ellen Pao got a lot of advice about how to succeed in the clubby, hypercompetitive, overwhelmingly male world of venture capital. Her annual evaluations were filled with suggestions about how she could improve and perhaps even advance to the inner circle of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the blue-chip firm where she was a junior partner. She would be paid millions and be at the red-hot center of the crucible of the tech economy.Ms. Pao did not make it. Exactly why is the subject of a lawsuit she filed against Kleiner, which is now being heard in civil court here. Ms. Pao contends she was discriminated against. Kleiner says she failed to improve despite all that coaching and was terminated.The money she might win if Kleiner is found liable is probably trivial in a world where start-up geniuses are worth billions. What is really under examination in this trial is the question of why there are so few women in leadership positions in Silicon Valley. At stake is any hope that the tech world can claim to be a progressive place, or even a fair one.In essence, Mr. Doerr said, it was not his fault. Venture capital firms draw from successful companies, and few entrepreneurs are women. It is a very slow process to change, although Mr. Doerr agreed that the percentage of female venture capitalists was \u201cpathetic.\u201dMr. Doerr, who backed Amazon and Google and whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at $3.5 billion, came across as an ambivalent figure during his hours of testimony.Ms. Pao, now 45 and interim chief of the social media site Reddit, was somewhere between Mr. Doerr\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and surrogate daughter. He promoted her, encouraged her and defended her after his colleagues soured on her. And his interest in having more women in technology seemed genuine.On the other hand, he said that Ms. Pao had \u201ca female chip on her shoulder,\u201d according to a report by an independent investigator hired by Kleiner. Mr. Doerr testified that he did not recall having said this, even after he was shown the relevant page in the report. He also said he had never read the report. \u201cIt was summarized for me,\u201d he said.The report, by Stephen Hirschfeld, was not admitted as evidence, but was extensively discussed in testimony Thursday. Ms. Pao\u2019s account to Mr. Hirschfeld depicted an office where sexism was rampant and she was told \u2014 in a friendly way \u2014 \u201cyou had to be one of the guys to be successful.\u201dKleiner, during its portion of the trial, will undoubtedly seek to undermine that view. Its lawyers told the judge on Thursday that they planned to call 17 witnesses, a number he found so astounding he repeated it in surprise.Yet even allowing for the fact that all the witnesses so far were called by Ms. Pao\u2019s team, documents and testimony in the trial show a firm whose attitudes derived from an earlier era. When Mr. Hirschfeld asked for a copy of Kleiner\u2019s manual on discrimination, it could not be found.Kleiner is only a few miles from Facebook, where the chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, wrote a popular book telling women to \u201clean in,\u201d by, for instance, seizing a seat at the table during meetings instead of hanging back at the edges.Not everyone at Kleiner appeared to have heard of such notions. At one meeting discussed in the trial, Ray Lane, a senior partner, needed someone to take notes. He asked two female junior partners, and was surprised when they said no, according to testimony.Ms. Pao, who is expected to testify as early as Friday, began at Kleiner in 2005 as Mr. Doerr\u2019s chief of staff. She had a consensual affair with a married junior partner, Ajit Nazre, that ended badly. Her suit maintains that Mr. Nazre was in a position to retaliate against her, and did so, and that her position at the firm suffered when she complained.Mr. Nazre later approached Trae Vassallo, another junior partner, on a business trip, showing up at her hotel room door wearing a bathrobe and carrying wine, according to testimony. She rebuffed Mr. Nazre and complained to Mr. Lane.\u201cI feared somewhat for her safety,\u201d Mr. Lane testified. Later, he underscored his alarm, adding: \u201cThis could have gone in a different direction. He could have pushed his way into the room.\u201dMr. Lane conceded his response to Ms. Vassallo\u2019s complaint was less than appropriate: He asked her if she really wanted to go public and if she had talked to her husband.\u201cI made a mistake,\u201d he told the court. \u201cI cared more about her feelings than anything else.\u201dMr. Lane also jokingly told Ms. Vassallo she should be \u201cflattered\u201d for Mr. Nazre\u2019s attention, Ms. Vassallo testified. He denied having said that.The men and women sitting in judgment of all this behavior look nothing like what Silicon Valley would consider a jury of its peers. Instead of being young, white and male, with a sprinkling of Asians \u2014 what critics say is the furthest limit in Silicon Valley in terms of diversity \u2014 the jury is half female and ethnically diverse. Testimony ended abruptly Thursday afternoon when one of the jurors had a family emergency.Before then, the jurors had been hearing for days about a world distant from that of most Americans. Ms. Pao, a Harvard-trained lawyer with deep experience in the tech field, was initially paid $220,000 a year, plus 30 to 60 percent of her base salary as a bonus, plus much more as her share of Kleiner\u2019s investment funds. In return for this, she was expected to do whatever she was told, according to testimony and emails shown at the trial. She polished a speech for Mr. Doerr on her honeymoon. When he recommended a book, she wrote the blurb. She worked so much that he begged her to stop, writing her at one point to \u201cplease, please really take a real leave. You deserve it!\u201dKleiner has had about 24 junior partners in its history, Mr. Doerr testified. Most of them were male. Most of them did not make it to the inner circle.\u201cWhat\u2019s unusual, what is truly unusual, is for a partner to be promoted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s happened only five times in the 30-year history of the firm.\u201d The others, he said, were asked \u201cto move on.\u201dOne of the five who made it was Wen Hsieh, who joined as a junior partner in 2006. Mr. Doerr saluted Mr. Hsieh, saying, \u201cthis guy bleeds for Kleiner.\u201d For a photo shoot, Mr. Hsieh literally gave Mr. Doerr the shirt off his back. When he moved to China, he took his family even though they did not want to go.Mr. Hsieh\u2019s testimony involved a lengthy examination of his annual evaluations, which had as many recommendations for improvement as Ms. Pao\u2019s.\u201cWen needs to speak up more and be willing to challenge our thinking,\u201d one review said. But another said: \u201cHe tends to fill every vacuum with his voice.\u201dThese contradictions were \u201chard to weigh,\u201d Mr. Hsieh told the court. And in any case, he had no time to discuss them further: He was flying to China that night.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a junior partner at Kleiner Perkins. She is Trae Vassallo, not Vasallo. An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled part of the name of the firm being sued.

{"Headline": "Greece Looks to Russia as Deal With Europe Stumbles", "Date": "2015-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 With the prospect of a default looming in Greece, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is preparing to meet next week with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a European deal to give more aid to Athens falters.The timing has raised questions of whether the visit is an ordinary component of the new Greek government\u2019s multipronged foreign policy, or a pivot toward Russia for financial aid in the event that Greece\u2019s talks with European officials collapse.Negotiations between the struggling Greek government and its creditors stumbled anew on Monday after European leaders said that a reform plan submitted over the weekend to unlock a fresh lifeline of 7.2 billion euros, or about $7.8 billion, fell short. Greece has warned that it may run out of money soon after Mr. Tsipras meets with Mr. Putin on April 8.Mr. Tsipras, who came to power in January, originally planned to travel to Moscow in May. But he accelerated the meeting with Mr. Putin a couple of weeks ago as Greece came to loggerheads with Germany and other European countries over the terms for releasing the money. Without it, Greece could go bankrupt or possibly exit the 19-nation eurozone, an event that, if it happened, could increase instability in the region.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s visit to Moscow is being billed by Athens as a routine meeting to strengthen the relationship between the countries, which have longstanding political and religious ties. But some Greek officials have suggested that Athens might be tempted to assess whether Russia, which is itself squaring off with Europe over the conflict in Ukraine, could be willing to ride in as a white knight if Europe steps back.\u201cThis is an attempt to ratchet up the pressure on the rest of the eurozone to make concessions to Greece,\u201d said Simon Tilford, the deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London.If so, he added, it is a gamble that could backfire. \u201cFlirting with Russia is guaranteed to antagonize the rest of the eurozone,\u201d Mr. Tilford said. \u201cIt will make it harder for those in Germany who were arguing for a more conciliatory line toward Greece to keep it.\u201dRelations between the new Greek government and other European countries have been strained almost since Mr. Tsipras took office. He has vowed to do away with the harsh austerity terms attached to Greece\u2019s \u20ac240 billion international bailout. The government struck a deal on Feb. 20 with European officials to extend the bailout and unlock a further \u20ac7.2 billion in aid for Athens, provided Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government made the required structural reforms.But creditors said the plans that Greece has submitted so far were inadequate, including a new proposal put forward over the weekend.In an address to Parliament on Monday night, Mr. Tsipras said that Greece\u2019s list of \u201cshort-term measures\u201d to creditors included curbing fuel and tobacco smuggling, checks on bank transfers and fighting sales tax fraud.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the \u2018haves\u2019 to start paying and for the looting of the middle class and salaried workers to stop,\u201d he said.In the negotiations with the creditors, he said, \u201cWe are seeking an honorable compromise with our partners, but do not expect an unconditional surrender.\u201dMr. Tsipras noted that a new law making it easier to pay back taxes raised \u20ac100 million in a week, but he reiterated that Greece\u2019s debt needs to be restructured for Athens to be able to repay it.With tax revenues falling quickly, Greece will be hard pressed to pay \u20ac450 million owed to the International Monetary Fund on April 9, the day after Mr. Tsipras\u2019s visit to Moscow.Most top Greek government officials have rejected suggestions in recent weeks that they might turn to Russia for aid. But others have courted the idea publicly, including Panos Kammenos, Greece\u2019s defense minister. Greece could seek financial help from Russia, China or the United States as a \u201cPlan B\u201d if Germany \u201cremains rigid and wants to blow Europe apart,\u201d he declared last month.Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said that Moscow would consider a Greek request for aid if one is made \u2014 an offer that the Russian ambassador to Greece repeated in an interview with Greek newspaper Kathimerini over the weekend.On Monday, the Greek energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, traveled to Moscow to meet with his Russian counterpart and the chief executive of the Russian energy giant Gazprom. As he prepared to leave for Moscow, Mr. Lafazanis lashed out at the European Union and Germany for \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around the Greek economy.Last month, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said in an interview that Mr. Tsipras had assured him he would not be a \u201ctroublemaker\u201d over European policy toward Russia.But few people have forgotten how the new Syriza-led government in Greece, just days after it was elected in January, denounced European Union sanctions against Russia over Ukraine. The move took European Union leaders by surprise and threatened to upend Europe\u2019s policy toward Moscow. Facing pressure, Athens quickly reversed its position and joined other countries in a unanimous vote to continue sanctions for Russia.Still, some officials in Brussels saw Greece\u2019s flip-flop as a bargaining ploy to win concessions from European Union creditors over the terms of Greece\u2019s bailout package. Athens has also talked of turning to China for help if need be.On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Yiannis Dragasakis met with Vice Premier Ma Kai in Beijing, where both men pledged to strengthen ties between the countries. Mr. Dragasakis also assured Beijing that the Chinese state-run shipping company Cosco could move ahead with a tender for a 67.7 percent stake in Greece\u2019s Piraeus Port Authority, one of the most strategic ports in southern Europe.Even if Greece were eventually to seek financial assistance from Moscow, Russia\u2019s economy is under pressure amid a collapse in oil prices and the lengthy conflict in Ukraine. It is expected to contract by at least 4 percent this year. While the ruble has been rising in recent days \u2014 and the sense that the Kremlin may be getting things under control is increasing \u2014 Russia may think twice if Mr. Tsipras were to seek large sums of financial aid, especially if loans risked not being repaid any time in the foreseeable future.\u201cMoscow could provide a little bit of funding to tide over the Greeks,\u201d Mr. Tilford said. \u201cBut it is not in a position to provide the kind of money that Greece would need to stay in the eurozone.\u201dGreece\u2019s European partners have suggested Athens may need to apply for a third bailout this summer, before an additional \u20ac7 billion worth of debts to the I.M.F. and the European Central Bank come due. Any new package could be in the tens of billions of euros, and would most certainly hinge on a string of harsh conditions that Greece would rather avoid.In the meantime, the haggling between Athens and Brussels continues. Greece and its creditors were expected to discuss the latest reforms on Wednesday, although no conclusion is expected during the Easter holiday on whether they will be sufficient to unlock cash.An earlier version of this article misstated the date on which Greece will have to pay about \u20ac450 million owed to the International Monetary Fund. It is April 9, the day after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras visits Moscow, not April 7, the day before.Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens, and David Herszenhorn from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Seasonal Fix for the Economy ", "Date": "2015-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialSome economic forecasters have pinned their hopes for an improvement in the economy on this year\u2019s early Easter to boost consumer spending after a brutal winter. That outlook has a dispiritingly familiar ring to it. In recent years, bad weather has often been blamed for weaker than expected economic performance while the prospect of Easter shopping and warmer weather has been seen as a sure catalyst for growth. To some extent, the economy does move up and down with the seasons. But time and again in the current recovery, seasonal upswings have not heralded sustainable improvements. The economy faces tougher problems than the weather, and there are no easy or automatic fixes. For instance, the economy was supposed to take off as unemployment fell. But unemployment is way down from its recession-era high, and there has been no big upsurge. Similarly, exports were supposed to help lead an economic revival. But the expected growth in exports has not occurred of late. To its credit, the Federal Reserve is facing those issues. In its latest statements and projections, issued last week, it did not flinch from marking down its earlier projections for economic growth and price inflation through 2017 \u2014 signaling that the economy is weaker than was thought to be the case only a few months ago. The markdowns also reflect underlying weaknesses in the economy that will not be corrected without fundamental changes. Accordingly, the Fed embraced a fundamental change last week when it acknowledged that unemployment can fall further than previously believed without causing inflation. That acknowledgment will allow the Fed to keep stimulating the economy, and encourage job growth, with loose monetary policy for the foreseeable future. What the Fed cannot directly affect is how much employers pay their workers. Stagnant and low pay is a decades-long phenomenon, but in the past its negative economic effects were masked partly by the growing participation of women in the work force and by easy credit for cash-strapped households. The former has run its course, and the latter has justifiably been curtailed. Moreover, in the current recovery, rising economic growth and rising job growth have so far failed to push up pay appreciably. Without higher wages, the needs and wants of everyday life, let alone the luxuries, remain out of reach for many families, and as a result the economy remains in low gear. Changing that dynamic will require policy changes beyond the Fed\u2019s purview, including a higher minimum wage, updated rules for overtime pay, stronger support for collective bargaining, better enforcement of wage and hour laws and tougher trade pacts. Congress has thus far not moved in any of those areas, though many lawmakers appear prepared to demand provisions in upcoming trade deals that would prevent currency manipulation that disadvantages American businesses and workers. States have a mixed record, with several of them raising their minimum wages, but others working to weaken collective bargaining. Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, has made it clear that she wants to see wage growth before she declares the labor market healthy. But where is that wage growth going to come from?

{"Headline": "Politics and Tradition Collide Over Iran Nuclear Talks", "Date": "2015-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama wants any nuclear deal reached with Iran to last at least 10 years. But a threat by Republican senators raises the question of whether it would last even 22 months.In their protocol-breaking letter to Iran this week, nearly four dozen Senate Republicans suggested that the next president could simply reverse such an agreement after Mr. Obama leaves office in January 2017. On one level, they were right. A new president could decide to not go along with the terms inherited from his predecessor.But it would be an extraordinary breach of tradition, one that most presidents have avoided. As a practical matter, presidents generally do not break international agreements because it could call into question the reliability of other agreements, alienate allies and set a precedent that few occupants of the White House want to set since they would like their pacts honored after they leave office.\u201cHe\u2019d be violating an international agreement with another country, but the president has the power to do that,\u201d said John B. Bellinger III, who served as the chief lawyer at the National Security Council and later the State Department under President George W. Bush. Few do so, he added, because \u201cit\u2019s sort of like judicial positions or positions in briefs that a prior administration has taken. There\u2019s sort of respect for precedent.\u201dThe letter, drafted by Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas in response to concerns that Mr. Obama\u2019s deal would not do enough to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons, touched off a sharp debate about the boundaries between the executive and legislative branches on foreign policy. Even as Republicans emphasized the limits of a deal brokered unilaterally by a president without submitting it to Congress, the White House and its allies fumed.The letter seemed aimed at sowing doubt among Iranian leaders that the United States would live up to the terms Mr. Obama is offering and therefore perhaps scuttle the talks. At first, Iran brushed off the threat, with its foreign minister dismissing it as a \u201cpropaganda ploy\u201d with no legal impact.What the United States and Iran want out of discussions over Iran\u2019s nuclear development.But Hamid Abutalebi, a key adviser to President Hassan Rouhani, issued a statement warning that congressional interference should be taken seriously. \u201cThis move must not be easily ignored,\u201d he said.Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the letter bolstered Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \u201cEven if the talks fail because Iran takes a maximalist position when negotiating behind closed doors, the blame will nevertheless be placed on the U.S. legislators for poisoning negotiations,\u201d she said.The debate underscored how modern presidents have exerted their executive authority in forging deals with foreign countries, much as they have expanded their authority to make war. While the Constitution requires a two-thirds Senate vote before a treaty can be ratified, presidents often skirt this requirement by negotiating what are called executive agreements with foreign counterparts.Since the 1930s, in fact, 94 percent of pacts between the United States and other countries have been executive agreements and just 6 percent have been treaties submitted to the Senate, according to a study by Glen Krutz of the University of Oklahoma and Jeffrey Peake of Clemson University. The vast bulk of them involve minor matters, like rules and practices in an increasingly globalized economy. But sometimes they involve controversial issues.In 2008, for instance, Mr. Bush signed an agreement with Iraq permitting American forces to remain there until the end of 2011. At the time, Mr. Obama, then a senator, and other Democrats objected that Congress should get to vote on it. \u201cThe notion that President Bush could somehow tie the hands of the next president, I think, is contrary to how our democracy\u2019s supposed to work,\u201d Mr. Obama said then.Now, on the issue of whether Congress should be consulted on such agreements, the positions have flipped: Republicans who supported Mr. Bush\u2019s authority to make his agreement are trying to insert themselves into Mr. Obama\u2019s dealings with Iran, while Mr. Obama is asserting his power as president to act on his own.In the Iran case, Mr. Obama would lift sanctions he has imposed under executive authority if Tehran agrees to curb its nuclear program for at least 10 years. He also has the power to suspend other sanctions imposed by Congress. Where lawmakers would have a role is if Mr. Obama agreed to completely lift congressional sanctions, which only Congress could do permanently.The letter warned that any nuclear agreement could be reversed by the next president \u201cwith the stroke of a pen.\u201dA coalition of Republican and Democratic lawmakers has crafted legislation to force Mr. Obama to submit the agreement to Congress for a vote, but some of those same Democrats are angry at the Republican decision to release the letter to Iran, seeing it as partisan.Other Democrats even suggested it may violate the Logan Act, a law passed under President John Adams making it illegal for any citizen \u201cwithout authority of the United States\u201d to carry on a correspondence with a foreign government \u201cwith intent to influence the measures or conduct\u201d of that government or \u201cto defeat the measures of the United States.\u201dWhile lawmakers in both parties have been accused of violating it over the years, it has never been enforced in modern times. Lawyers and former officials said the Republican letter probably would not cross the legal line because it was styled as an \u201copen letter\u201d and not actually sent to Iran, similar to an op-ed in the newspaper.\u201cThis is an open letter, an open statement, not an interference in negotiations,\u201d said Elliott Abrams, a veteran of the Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush administrations. \u201cThey have no vow of silence on foreign affairs.\u201dStill, it was up for debate whether a new president would unravel a deal set by Mr. Obama. Mr. Bush abrogated the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty after taking office, but by exercising a withdrawal clause included in the document. He also renounced the Kyoto climate change treaty negotiated by Bill Clinton, but that treaty had never been submitted to the Senate for a vote and so was never in force.Backing out of an Iran agreement would be more complicated, especially because it also would mean bailing out on allies like Britain, Germany and France. \u201cTechnically, a president could change things,\u201d Mr. Krutz said. \u201cBut they\u2019re so unlikely to do so on a previous executive agreement because there are multiple other signatories.\u201dThat would be even more complicated if the Iran agreement is taken to the United Nations Security Council for approval. \u201cThe U.N. nature of it adds a level of legality that makes it different from just an agreement between the United States and Iran,\u201d said Mark Fitzpatrick, an Iran expert at London\u2019s International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cA Security Council resolution will give it standing that makes it even more concrete and harder for a successor to simply undo.\u201dIndeed, a United Nations resolution would enshrine legal obligations for Iran, too, in terms of inspections and verification, said Camille Grand, director of the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris. \u201cThe Security Council is meant not to bless the deal,\u201d he said, \u201cbut carve it into marble.\u201dA news analysis article on Wednesday about a debate over protocol touched off by an open letter to Iran sent by Republican senators who object to the nuclear deal President Obama is negotiating with Iran misspelled, in some editions, the given name of a veteran of the Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush administrations who said the letter was \u201cnot an interference in negotiations.\u201d He is Elliott Abrams, not Elliot. The article also referred incorrectly to the director of the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris, who said that if the deal were taken to the United Nations Security Council for approval, it would enshrine legal obligations on Iran. The director, Camille Grand, is a man.Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Steven Erlanger from London. Thomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Abuse at Attica Calls for Federal Scrutiny", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe three guards should have gone to prison. Instead, the Wyoming County district attorney let them plead guilty to a misdemeanor \u2014 which means they will do no jail time \u2014 and allowed them to resign from their jobs, which means their pensions will remain intact. The case has drawn back the curtains on the insular communities that surround Attica, where prisons dominate the economy, the guards\u2019 union dominates local politics and prosecutors may be unwilling to bring to bear the full force of the law. The assault happened in August 2011, when three guards \u2014 all at least 240 pounds \u2014 converged on an inmate named George Williams, apparently because they believed he had insulted them. The guards ordered him to strip for a search and then marched him down the hall to a darkened room where he was beaten with of batons, fists and kicks until he begged for his life, as inmates in nearby cells watched the attack. A hospital in Buffalo chronicled the injuries: two broken legs, one of which had to be realigned through surgery using a plate and several screws; a fracture of the orbit around his left eye; several cracked ribs; a broken shoulder; and multiple cuts and bruises. The guards were to go on trial in western New York on Monday, charged with assault, filing false documents and evidence tampering; each would have faced a minimum of five years imprisonment if convicted. After letting them plead to a misdemeanor and no prison time, the Wyoming County district attorney, Donald O\u2019Geen, said that the case had \u201cnever been about jail for these officers\u201d as though the barbaric acts they committed were not to be taken seriously.Mr. Williams, who was preparing testimony for the trial, referred to the plea agreement as \u201ccrazy.\u201d The Justice Department should examine the case to determine whether federal civil rights charges would be appropriate. State officials assert that reforms are moving forward at Attica \u2014 which is primarily known for a violent prison uprising that occurred in 1971 \u2014 and that officers are using less force against inmates. Nevertheless, inmates say that some guards still commit unchecked violence and then justify savage beatings by concocting false charges of inmate misconduct. The attack on Mr. Williams shows that there are still deep problems at Attica. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why More Education Won\u2019t Fix Economic Inequality", "Date": "2015-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncomes and OutcomesSuppose you accept the persuasive data that inequality has been rising in the United States and most advanced nations in recent decades. But suppose you don\u2019t want to fight inequality through politically polarizing steps like higher taxes on the wealthy or a more generous social welfare system.Brad Hershbein, Melissa Kearney and Lawrence Summers offer a simple little simulation that shows the limits of education as an inequality-fighter. In short, more education would be great news for middle and lower-income Americans, increasing their pay and economic security. It just isn\u2019t up to the task of meaningfully reducing inequality, which is being driven by the sharp upward movement of the very top of the income distribution.It is all the more interesting that the research comes from Mr. Summers, a former Treasury secretary who is hardly known as a soak-the-rich class warrior. It is published by the Hamilton Project, a centrist research group operating with Wall Street funding and seeking to find third-way-style solutions to America\u2019s problems that can unite left and right.In their simulation, they assume that 10 percent of non-college-educated men of prime working age suddenly obtained a college degree or higher, which would be an unprecedented rise in the proportion of the work force with advanced education.They assume that these more educated men go from their current pay levels to pay that is in line with current college graduates, minus an adjustment for the fact that more college grads in the work force could depress their wages a bit.There is no doubt that in this simulated world with a more educated labor force, middle-income workers earn more \u2014 $37,060 in simulated 2013 earnings for a person at the 50th percentile, compared with $34,000 in the real world, a 9 percent improvement.But that improvement brings that 50th-percentile worker only back closer to the inflation-adjusted level of income he enjoyed in 1979, which was $37,838. Meanwhile, the 90th-percentile worker in this simulation holds onto (and indeed improves upon) the sharp income gains of the past 34 years. Annual earnings at the 90th percentile climbed from $75,700 in 1979 to more than $100,000 in both the actual 2013 data and the simulation with higher education levels.Add it all up, and the Gini ratio, a frequently used measure of income inequality, would decrease only to 0.55 from 0.57 in this scenario of drastic educational improvement. It would still be far higher than the 0.43 recorded in 1979.None of this is to say that a better educational system isn\u2019t desirable. The 9 percent income gain for middle-income men evident in the authors\u2019 simulation is a big deal.In other words, it\u2019s worth pursuing more and better education for working-class Americans on its own terms, because it will improve their lives and economic potential. Inequality, meanwhile, is a deeper problem, and its potential solutions remain ideologically divisive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil Official Charged in Petrobras Bribery Case", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Prosecutors on Monday filed new corruption charges arising out of the huge bribery scheme at Petrobras, the national oil company, against the treasurer of the ruling Workers Party \u2014 putting additional pressure on President Dilma Rousseff at a time when she is fighting calls for her ouster over the burgeoning scandal. The charges against the treasurer, Jo\u00e3o Vaccari, moved the payoff scandal closer to Ms. Rousseff herself. A former executive at Petrobras testified earlier this month that he met with Mr. Vaccari to define how the party should receive bribes from contractors vying for business with the oil giant. The former Petrobras executive, Pedro Barusco, who was also charged in the scheme on Monday, said that the Workers Party had received as much as $200 million in bribes. Mr. Barusco said that some of those payoffs were channeled to Ms. Rousseff\u2019s first presidential campaign, in 2010. \u201cVaccari knew that the payments were actually bribes,\u201d Deltan Dallagnol, a prosecutor in the investigation, told reporters in the southern city of Curitiba. The developments in the scandal have shaken Brazil\u2019s political establishment, with the Supreme Court authorizing investigations of powerful legislators in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ruling coalition. Setting an important precedent in Brazil, corporate executives accused of paying the bribes have spent months in jail as investigators examine the charges. No testimony has emerged suggesting that Ms. Rousseff, who led the Petrobras board of directors during much of the time that the payoff scheme unfolded, personally profited from the scheme. Responding to the latest developments in the scandal, Ms. Rousseff said Monday that the work by the prosecutors pointed to institutional independence in Brazil. \u201cIf they want to investigate, then they\u2019re going to investigate, and those who are responsible will pay for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d she said. The Workers Party, which has held power since 2003, has repeatedly denied that it received illegal campaign donations. Mr. Vaccari has also denied wrongdoing. In addition to Mr. Vaccari, prosecutors filed corruption charges on Monday against 26 others including Renato Duque, a former high-ranking Petrobras executive with close ties to powerful figures in the Workers Party. The Federal Police took Mr. Duque into custody on Monday after investigators said they had found more than $20 million in accounts controlled by him in Monaco and other tax havens. S\u00e9rgio Moro, the judge overseeing the investigation of the bribery scheme, said Mr. Duque had moved the money into the accounts last year in an attempt to hide it from the authorities. The police on Monday also seized a vast art collection at Mr. Duque\u2019s home in Rio de Janeiro, including works by the painters Djanira da Motta e Silva and Alberto da Veiga Guignard. Mr. Duque was previously detained by the police last year until a justice on the high court ordered his release. Alexandre Lopes, a lawyer for Mr. Duque, said his client denied having any involvement in illicit activities at Petrobras. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Putin and the 'Mariupol Test'", "Date": "2015-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 As the West remains divided over providing defensive lethal weapons to Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin of Russia is pondering whether to move on the strategic Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. The West needs to unite and deter him.President Obama has now agreed to provide Ukraine with $75 million in nonlethal assistance, a decision which is unlikely to satisfy those in Washington and Kiev who want the United States to send antitank and antiaircraft weapons. A new approach is needed.The Minsk II cease-fire agreement brokered by Russia, Germany and France last month has changed the political dynamics in Europe. Germany and to a lesser degree France have resisted calls to provide lethal weapons to Kiev, and much of the rest of Europe takes its cue from Berlin and Paris. They did not want the arms issue to interfere with the Minsk negotiations, and they continue to oppose sending weapons to Ukraine as long as the basic cease-fire holds. They do not want to give a pretext to Mr. Putin and his proxies to move further into Ukraine.Chancellor Angela Merkel is now widely associated with the cease-fire, and to some degree Germany is seen as a key guarantor that the agreement will be maintained. Some German politicians have quietly indicated that they would need to reconsider their overall policy should a fundamental breach of the cease-fire take place. A major Russian separatist attack on Mariupol would represent such a breach and would trigger a major European policy review.Given this reality, a coordinated trans-Atlantic initiative could both unite the West and deter Mr. Putin from pursuing what is likely to be one of his key goals \u2014 the creation of a land bridge from Russia to Crimea. A Western initiative \u2014 call it \u201cthe Mariupol test\u201d \u2014 would require the United States to reach agreement with Germany and the rest of Europe now on how the West would react should Mr. Putin make a move against the city. It would require the Obama administration to press its European allies to unite and deter Mr. Putin\u2019s next move.Russia has already violated the Minsk II cease-fire agreement by seizing the strategic transportation hub of Debaltseve a few days after the accord was reached. Although Western intelligence reports that Moscow is moving in more heavy weapons, the rest of the cease-fire line still seems to be holding, for now.Along with many policy makers and analysts in Washington, we believe that providing lethal weapons to Kiev would show solidarity with Ukraine, make further military moves by Russia more painful, and deter Mr. Putin from aggressive steps elsewhere. Yet maintaining alliance unity in the face of the Kremlin\u2019s challenge is critical to designing the kind of multifaceted response needed to prevent Ukraine from collapsing.Mr. Putin is unlikely to honor Minsk II if he believes he can circumvent it without much cost. He is proud, emotional, aggrieved and shrewd \u2014 historically a dangerous combination. His skills, well-honed at the K.G.B., include a perfected ability to obfuscate and divide. His long-term goal may be the creation of \u201cNovorossiya,\u201d or New Russia, which would constitute all of southern Ukraine past Odessa to Moldova, and would enable Russia to control the entire northern coast of the Black Sea. There are no large armies to stop him.If he succeeds, Ukraine would be a less-viable state, heavily dependent on Russia for access to the sea. The West would have failed to preserve Ukrainian independence or halt Russian aggression.Mr. Putin may seek to create Novorossiya one slender slice at a time, thereby reducing his chances of massive confrontation with the West. An intermediate Kremlin goal would be to connect Crimea by land to Russia. Mariupol stands in the way. Ukrainian volunteers of all ages are digging trenches there to block what they believe will be Mr. Putin\u2019s next move. The West must decide how to prevent Mariupol from becoming another bloody road bump on Mr. Putin\u2019s westward drive.American and European leaders urgently need to construct a viable deterrent to Mr. Putin\u2019s plans for Novorossiya. This would not include NATO boots on the ground, since few in government or the public at large in Europe and America support that option. But any plan to contain Russia must be tough to be effective.Mr. Putin has said he wants the cease-fire to hold. The West needs to unite and force him to keep that promise. It needs to construct a Mariupol test, which will turn that town from a road bump into a red line with teeth.Washington and its European allies need to decide now what they will do should the separatist fighters and their Russian enablers who took Donetsk and Luhansk appear in Mariupol in force.Under such circumstances, Kiev must be given lethal weapons and training, not just by the United States but by the Europeans as well. Tougher economic sanctions should also be imposed. The West should publicly discuss suspending Russia from the Brussels-based Swift financial-messaging system, a step which could cripple the already reeling Russian economy. Strict new limits on visas for Russian travel to the West should also be imposed. Such measures could ignite a dramatic reaction from Russia, such as a natural gas cut-off to Europe. But absent the will to introduce Western ground forces, it will take stern measures such as these to deter Moscow.Should the cease-fire hold and Ukraine regain full control of its territory, then the West may start to ease sanctions. Mr. Putin will need incentives for him to back down. That can be done without accepting what the Kremlin has gained through violence.A carrot-and-stick approach also should have some appeal in Germany. If Germany leads on this issue the rest of Europe is likely to follow. As Ms. Merkel has said, the stakes for Europe are high. If military force can be used to change borders, the rules that have created a fairly unified, peaceful and prosperous Europe are open to revision everywhere.Hans Binnendijk is a senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins Center for Transatlantic Relations and served as senior director for defense policy at the National Security Council.

{"Headline": "Oil Prices Drop as Production Hums Along Despite a Brimming Supply", "Date": "2015-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Just as the oil market appeared to be stabilizing, the price of crude resumed its descent on Friday.The drop, of about 4 percent, came after a report from the International Energy Agency warning that oil pouring into tank farms in the United States might \u201csoon test storage capacity limits.\u201dThe agency, whose reports are closely monitored by oil traders, said that overflowing storage \u201cwould inevitably lead to renewed price weakness.\u201d American production of oil continues to increase despite recently announced cutbacks in new drilling by producers.The price of West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark, fell to around $45 a barrel on Friday, while Brent, the international benchmark, fell below $55 a barrel.Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based research firm, said that with winter coming to an end in much of the world, the oil market was most likely due for a spell of softness. Refineries in Europe and Asia will now be undergoing routine maintenance, leading to a period of weaker demand for crude. \u201cWe are expecting another period of weakness,\u201d Mr. Mallinson said in an interview.Additionally, striking refinery workers in the United States reached a tentative deal this week to end their walkout. Although the walkout affected 12 refineries, it had minimal impact on production as managers and other workers kept the plants running.While prices rose to more than $60 a barrel for Brent recently, the fundamentals in the market had not changed greatly since oil prices hit multiyear lows in the early part of this year, the agency said in its report. The supply of oil from the United States, which has increased production by more than four million barrels a day since 2009 \u2014 more than the total output of either Iraq or Iran \u2014 shows little sign of slowing down, the agency said.At the same time, Russian exports have been rising, and Saudi Arabia, the third of the world oil production leaders, increased output slightly in January and February.Those low prices have helped lift demand for oil to higher levels than forecasters expected in places like India, Brazil and Indonesia. Even China, whose economy is widely reported to be slowing, is still lapping up lots of crude. Overall demand, which is up more than a million barrels per day over last year, according to Energy Aspects, has trimmed expected inventory builds outside of the United States.Stronger-than-expected global demand helps explain the wider-than-usual gap in pricing between Brent, which is used as a reference in much of the globe, and W.T.I. With operators in the United States largely barred from exporting crude, the surplus barrels have nowhere to go, and inventories have risen to near record levels.Still, seasoned traders were taken by surprise by the roughly 30 percent rise in Brent prices to over $60 a barrel since the six-year lows in January. When oil was scraping bottom, for instance, trading companies like Trafigura Beheer booked fleets of tankers to use as storage to take advantage of the steep spread between current prices for crude and those further out.

{"Headline": "Our Immigration Policy", "Date": "2015-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySunday DialogueReaders discuss whether undocumented immigrants should be legitimized and integrated into the United States economy.As an Englishman living in the United States, I find that the three-way tug-of-war between Congress, President Obama and 26 states challenging his executive actions on immigration reminds me in some ways of the Scottish referendum on independence, which was voted down last September. In both cases the key question is really one of preservation of perceived cultural heritage. The economic arguments bend in the wind to serve their political master. Does the world really need more fences and borders?The real global goal should be economic equity that can preserve culture while encouraging positive migration in all directions: essentially, a world without borders. The United States is a young country and is still in the process of rapid evolution (unlike its European counterparts). That evolutionary process has the potential to be a beacon of what the world could or should look like.Addressing the current population of immigrants in this country requires more than an executive action stemming deportation. I believe that the hidden fear is of cultural contamination, not jobs or resource allocation. There is still a pervasive feeling that one has to \u201cfight\u201d for one\u2019s place in American society. I think that time is over, and positive integration has to be the way forward.Knowledge is power. We need to actively integrate the immigrant population, which is primarily Hispanic, into the American economic engine by providing the tools to learn about filing taxes, opening bank accounts, obtaining auto insurance and other basic activities we take for granted.An orderly legitimization program would be the least expensive and most productive (did I hear anyone say tax dollars?) way forward. As to a check and balance, market forces will control immigration better than any fence.The legitimization of the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants should be less about the political machinations of policy, and more about the beginning of a new global understanding of how we should cooperatively share this brilliant blue marble we call home.The writer is chief development officer of SABEResPODER (Knowledge Is Power), which works to empower Spanish-speaking consumers.Mr. Ridley\u2019s open borders proposal is just as na\u00efve and dangerous as xenophobic efforts to defend a presumed cultural purity, but he is surely right that we need to pursue \u201cpositive integration\u201d in the face of rapid change. We also need balanced policies that allow talent to flow into our country while ensuring the safety, security and welfare of our citizens.If our borders were made secure, the vast majority of Americans would support a path to citizenship for those undocumented immigrants who can prove they have lived here for some time and have no criminal record. This path would place them at the back of the line and would include sanctions for knowingly breaking our laws. Annual limits and qualifications will inevitably remain matters of political push and pull. The best way forward globally is to ensure that the United States remains a nation of laws, strong and secure enough to be a model and a force for good throughout the world.The writer is a professor of history at Davidson College.Many correlate the dispossession of working-class Americans and a tide of white nationalism. At the same time, the lost promise of the civil rights movement has also left Americans, black and white, feeling hopeless about prospects for racial egalitarianism. Amid this swirl of threats it is a wonder that support exists for enfranchising undocumented Americans. And yet, miraculously, it does. Slow action on immigration reform does not originate with a hostile citizenry but rather with a flailing, polarized Congress. Advocates for immigration reform must remain committed to giving vulnerable Americans a solid economic and social footing while firmly insisting that we treat immigrants according to the same egalitarian principles.The writer is an associate professor of political science at Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University.Mr. Ridley speaks in practical terms of our primarily Hispanic immigrants\u2019 need for integration into our economic engine, \u201cto learn about filing taxes, opening bank accounts, obtaining auto insurance.\u201d In what language are they presented? English. The time, effort and money expended to overcome, in our welcoming zeal, the lack of language assimilation is staggering and offensive. Obviously I do not subscribe to Mr. Ridley\u2019s Pollyannaish view of what the world should be.There seems to be a feeling that a world without borders cannot exist or is \u201cna\u00efve,\u201d as mentioned by Mr. Barnes. A visit to Europe would show that not to be the case. The goal of immigrants, contrary to what Mr. Frauenglass suggests, is the same now as at any other time. They want to find a better life for themselves and their families and are willing to assimilate if given the opportunity. You cannot have \u201clanguage assimilation\u201d among an educationally marginalized group.Some Americans opposed to legalization worry about job competition from an immigrant population that accepts low wages. I would argue that it is the Western world\u2019s insatiable desire for low prices with no thought to their social consequences that has created this situation. It appears that we are not concerned whether those low prices are generated by sweatshop labor in a far-off country or more remarkably from people who actually live among us. People move to fill a created need. It is all of us who are guilty of creating that need.The United States, like many Western economies, is potentially heading for a demographic crisis. Without immigration and an increased birthrate, I\u2019m not sure who is going to drive the economic engine. The imperative to ensure that this population is as educated as possible is both social and economic. Future tax revenues depend on it.Sometimes practical decisions need to be made that fly in the face of current legislation and what some might consider fair. Ultimately, if we want to preserve the way of life we enjoy, it is imperative that we legitimize, educate and assimilate our immigrant population.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "First Amendment, \u2018Patron Saint\u2019 of Protesters, Is Embraced by Corporations", "Date": "2015-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySidebarWASHINGTON \u2014 Liberals used to love the First Amendment. But that was in an era when courts used it mostly to protect powerless people like civil rights activists and war protesters.\u201cCorporations have begun to displace individuals as the direct beneficiaries of the First Amendment,\u201d Professor Coates wrote. The trend, he added, is \u201crecent but accelerating.\u201d\u201cOnce the patron saint of protesters and the disenfranchised, the First Amendment has become the darling of economic libertarians and corporate lawyers who have recognized its power to immunize private enterprise from legal restraint,\u201d Professor Wu wrote.\u201cAn expansive conception of free speech became attractive to Republican justices,\u201d he wrote, \u201cboth because robust free-speech protection fit neatly into the right\u2019s skeptical, deregulatory approach to government generally, and because it encouraged vigorous transmission by powerful speakers of the right\u2019s newly energized collection of ideas.\u201dThose conservative justices, Professor Neuborne wrote, found willing allies in liberal justices long committed to free speech.In the next two decades, the Supreme Court continued to protect dissent, twice voting to strike down laws banning flag burning. But now, Professor Neuborne wrote, broad coalitions of justices also voted to protect the powerful.By the time the left woke up and realized it had made \u201ca Faustian bargain,\u201d Professor Neuborne wrote, \u201cthe bipartisan coalition had generated an enormously powerful body of precedent establishing an imperial free speech clause.\u201dMore striking, the success rates for both groups increased, but far more for businesses. Individuals won 55 percent of the time, up from 41 percent. Businesses also won 55 percent of the time, up from 20 percent.Before 1976, First Amendment challenges from corporations generally involved companies in the business of free expression, like newspapers, book publishers and film producers. More recently, companies have filed free-speech challenges to laws regulating how ordinary products may be marketed or advertised.Professor Coates also analyzed data from federal appeals courts, finding that \u201cbusinesses are growing steadily more aggressive in their use of the First Amendment.\u201d Court dockets these days are full of free-speech challenges from pharmaceutical firms, tobacco companies, miners, meat producers and airlines.Such lawsuits, he wrote, have pernicious consequences for both free enterprise and the rule of law. Corporations are diverting resources from research and innovation to litigation, he wrote.\u201cConcentrated, moneyed interests, represented by those in control of the country\u2019s largest business corporations,\u201d he wrote, \u201care increasingly able to turn law into a lottery, reducing law\u2019s predictability, impairing property rights, and increasing the share of the economy devoted to rent-seeking rather than productive activity.\u201dThe court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has been receptive to arguments based on corporations\u2019 free-speech rights.\u201cIt is part of a trend in First Amendment law that is transforming that body of doctrine into a charter of largely untrammeled libertarianism,\u201d he wrote, \u201cin which the regulation of virtually all forms of speech and all kinds of speakers is treated with the same heavy dose of judicial skepticism, with exceptions perversely calculated to expose particularly vulnerable and valuable sorts of expression to unconvincingly justified suppression.\u201dProfessor Tribe gave examples of the sorts of people whose First Amendment arguments have not fared well in the Roberts court: students, prisoners, pacifists and whistle-blowers.\u201cThere is truth in the proposition that a number of recent First Amendment victories in recent years have been on behalf of the \u2018haves\u2019 \u2014 some of them corporations, some individuals,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is no basis for concluding that the decisions were wrongly analyzed or wrongly decided.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Moscow's Twisted History Lessons", "Date": "2015-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRussia\u2019s Victory Day, celebrated on May 9th, has for decades been its most unifying event of the year domestically and its least controversial holiday internationally. But because of the peculiarities of the Kremlin\u2019s politics of history, Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the ongoing struggle over Ukraine, even the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the end of the Great Patriotic War has become divisive. Heads of state the world over have been invited to the military parade in Moscow to mark the defeat of Hitler\u2019s Germany. According to the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, leaders from China, Israel, the Czech republic, Serbia, North Korea and most former Soviet republics are planning to attend. But those from the Western countries that were Russia\u2019s closest World War II allies have declined. Russia has always had a love-hate relationship with the West. Writers from Turgenev to Brodsky worked to build bridges, while others, from Dostoyevsky to Solzhenitsyn, have warned that the West\u2019s morals, cultures and customs are somehow corrupting. President Vladimir Putin and his supporters have opted to embrace the view that the West has always sought to corrupt and cheat the Russian people, to thwart the country\u2019s development and prevent Russia from taking its rightful place in the world. They have long insisted that the United States and its allies were unjust to Russia as the Cold War drew to a close, even as Moscow voluntarily gave up its interests in Central and Eastern Europe. And they castigate their own countrymen who have sought and still seek greater ties with the West.\u201cThe greatest criminals in our history were those weaklings who threw Russian power on the floor \u2014 Nicholas II and Mikhail Gorbachev \u2014 those who allowed the power to be picked up by the hysterics and the madmen,\u201d the journalist Ben Judah reported Mr. Putin as saying privately to his aides.These themes have become central to Mr. Putin\u2019s public discourse as well. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop taking note only of the bad things in our history and berating ourselves more than even our opponents would do,\u201d he declared at the annual gathering of international Russia experts known as the Valdai Discussion Club in 2013. \u201cWe must be proud of our history.\u201d Mr. Putin has buttressed his domestic standing by bending history to justify his self-proclaimed mission to reclaim Russia\u2019s lost glory. In a documentary released on national TV to coincide with the anniversary of the annexation of Crimea, which officially became part of Russia on March 21, 2014, Mr. Putin took personal responsibility for the move, calling the loss of the peninsula and the historic Russian naval port of Sebastapol as the Soviet Union collapsed a \u201chistoric injustice\u201d that had to be corrected. This premise is certainly a selective one. Take the case of Perm-36, a museum of Soviet repression created in 1992 on the site of a former penal colony 800 miles east of Moscow. The privately run museum, named after the Soviet designation for the prison camp, was dedicated to the victims of Stalinism. But the local government, sensing a need to demonstrate loyalty to the Kremlin, pushed the organization out. Perm-36 will soon reopen as a state museum dedicated to the airbrushed history of the Russian penal system.This distorted approach to the past, which stresses Russian triumphs while dismissing Russian crimes, continues in the Kremlin\u2019s current relations with Washington and the capitals of Western Europe. Nowhere is this more obvious than in Russia\u2019s relationship with Germany, a country that has built its post-World War II identity on being open and penitent about the dark side of its history. On a recent visit to Japan, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germany, despite the brutality and horror of the Hitler era, is now accepted by the international community not only because of the generosity of its neighbors but also because of the \u201creadiness in Germany to face our history openly and squarely.\u201d Today Ms. Merkel presides over Europe\u2019s biggest and most successful economy. Gradually and reluctantly, Germany is assuming a leading role on European foreign policy issues. The Ukraine crisis \u2014 and the low-key stance the Obama administration has taken in dealing with it \u2014 have forced her to take the initiative. After the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, it was both symbolic and justified that Germany, Russia\u2019s bitterest enemy in Europe\u2019s most ugly and murderous war, became the nation that took its strategic relationship with Russia the most seriously.\u201cGerman policy makers really did think they, and they alone, could bring Russia into the West,\u201d says Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cGermany was Russia\u2019s bridgehead into Europe. Vladimir Putin has destroyed this bridge single-handedly.\u201d Western leaders insist that they do not want another Cold War with Russia. Nevertheless, the atmosphere with Moscow is so chilly and the anger over Mr. Putin\u2019s aggressions is so pronounced that neither President Obama nor the leaders of Britain, Poland, the Baltic countries and most other European Union member states plan to be in Moscow for the Victory Day parade. Neither does the chancellor of Germany. But though Angela Merkel, ever the peacemaker, will skip the main celebration, she nevertheless plans to lay a wreath at the Kremlin Wall before the tomb of the unknown soldier.Advertisement"}

Gramley, who served as a White House economic adviser and a Federal Reserve governor in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as the economy fought exceptionally high inflation and a deep recession, died on Sunday at his home in Potomac, Md. He was 88.The cause was complications of spinal stenosis, his wife, Marlys, said.Mr. Gramley had spent more than two decades as an economist at the Federal Reserve when he was named in early 1977 by the newly elected president, Jimmy Carter, as one of three members of the Council of Economic Advisers. In May 1980, he was appointed to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, where he stayed until September 1985. Those were tumultuous years for the economy, which was reeling from the oil shocks of the 1970s. Unemployment was above 10 percent, inflation was in double digits, and the country was suffering through one of its worst economic slowdowns since the Great Depression.Working from the Old Executive Office Building, across the street from the White House, Mr. Gramley was one of President Carter\u2019s most senior economic advisers and forecasters. Economic policy was then focused on a single goal: bringing down inflation. \u201cInflation drains consumer purchasing power,\u201d Mr. Gramley said in August 1979. But even as he took some blame for the failures of the Carter administration\u2019s economic policies, once he joined the Fed board, Mr. Gramley emerged as one of the Fed chairman Paul A. Volcker\u2019s main allies in pushing for more aggressive action against inflation; heeding the call, the Fed soon raised a benchmark interest rate to 20 percent.In a speech he gave in September 1980, shortly after returning to the Fed, Mr. Gramley indicated how all-encompassing the issue of inflation was.\u201cThe problem of inflation is so intractable that no single measure to deal with it will suffice,\u201d he said. \u201cOur only hope for making substantial progress against inflation over the next several years lies in keeping the fight against inflation at the forefront of every economic policy decision.\u201dSome senators criticized the appointment of Mr. Gramley, a Fed insider, to the board as a sign that it had become clubby and inbred.After Mr. Carter was succeeded by Ronald Reagan in 1981, tensions between the White House and the Fed increased until a truce was called four months into the Reagan presidency. According to The New York Times, the White House agreed to mute criticism of the Fed\u2019s monetary policies, and Mr. Volcker agreed in turn that Mr. Gramley would stop publicly expressing doubts about the Reagan economic program.The Fed\u2019s policies to tame double-digit inflation succeeded. Averaging nearly 14 percent in 1980, inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, had fallen below 4 percent by the end of 1982.Lyle Elden Gramley was born on Jan. 14, 1927, in Aurora, Ill., the youngest of four children of Cook Gramley and the former Myrtle Pflugfelder. From 1944 to 1947, he served in the Navy submarine service as an electronic technician.After leaving the Navy, Mr. Gramley attended Aurora University before transferring to Beloit College in Wisconsin, from which he graduated in 1951. He then studied economics at Indiana University, earning a master\u2019s degree in 1952 and a doctorate in 1956. He joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City as a financial analyst in 1955. Mr. Gramley was an assistant professor of economics at the University of Maryland from 1962 to 1964, before becoming a senior economist for the Fed. In 1974, he was named director of the Division of Research and Statistics at the Fed.Mr. Gramley married Evelyn Wachtel, a concert pianist, in 1951; she died in 1981. His second marriage, in 1983, to Sandra Royal, ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, the former Marlys Fee Jensen, whom he married in 1989, he is survived by a son, Alan Gramley, and a daughter, Lynn Gramley Dawson, from his first marriage; two stepsons, Michael and Kevin Jensen; and two granddaughters.After leaving the Fed board, Mr. Gramley was named chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. His approach to his work was summed up in words he had used to describe Mr. Volcker. \u201cI think of Paul Volcker as a pragmatic, eclectic economist,\u201d he said shortly before joining the Fed board, \u201cand I would so label myself.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHUNDER BAY, Ontario \u2014 The trip to pick up a load of iron ore powder in Conneaut, Ohio, was supposed to take four days by way of the Great Lakes.It was a 24-day ordeal, and the ship returned to its home port in Wisconsin without picking up the cargo.A deep freeze this winter left much of the Great Lakes blanketed in thick ice, sidelining the ship lines and companies that move vast amounts of grain, cement and other commodities through this system of waterways. And now the spring thaw, which creates piles of impassable ice, will most likely create more delays.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ice out there, and we need to understand the impact of that ice,\u201d said Mark Barker, the president of the Interlake Steamship Company, which carries mostly iron ore, coal and limestone on its nine ships. \u201cLast year, we pretty much lost the month of April.\u201dCold spells and snowstorms have taken a bite out of businesses across the Northeast and Midwest of the United States, as well as in Canada. Car manufacturers have blamed the weather for weak sales. Housing starts, too, have slumped. And blizzards in places like Boston have been brutal for many local businesses.Michael Dolega, who analyzes the United States economy at the Toronto-Dominion Bank, says he expects that the weather will cut first-quarter growth by as much as three-quarters of a percentage point. And not all of that loss will be made up later in the year, he said.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a welcome development,\u201d said Mr. Dolega, who is based in Toronto.The Great Lakes shipping trade largely hibernates during the late winter months, with occasional sailings for supplies like road salt. The Arthur M. Anderson was making its last run of the season in early February when it became stuck.Shipping is usually up and running again by March. But the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, the critical system of locks that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes, has been postponed until April 2. Even when the locks open, there is no assurance that all of the lakes, particularly choke points prone to ice buildup, will be navigable.Last year\u2019s ice-induced delays reduced early shipments from the United States by seven million tons, according to the Lake Carriers\u2019 Association, which represents American shipowners. That amounts to about 10 percent of all American shipments on the lakes.The Great Lakes are a vital conduit for companies in a wide range of industries. Grain from farms in Western Canada makes its way to markets around the world. Iron ore travels to steel mills along the shorelines. Power plants depend on the coal that travels via the lakes. Companies in steelmaking, electrical generation, construction and agriculture \u2014 like Cargill, United States Steel and Lafarge \u2014 all need the waterways.For companies now facing dwindling stockpiles, there are few alternatives to ships for restocking. Shipping by rail is more costly, even if the tracks were not already overloaded. And hauling large quantities of, say, iron ore by truck is neither practical nor cost-effective. Replacing a single Great Lakes ore-carrying ship requires about 2,400 tractor-trailer trucks.During a normal winter, some ships can continue to make relatively short treks without much trouble, particularly when ice cover is light. But the last two winters have been particularly harsh.In 2014, ice cover peaked at 92.5 percent, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich. Ice persisted in some places until June. This year, ice cover was 89.1 percent.\u201cTwo especially severe winters back to back \u2014 we haven\u2019t seen that in a long time,\u201d said George A. Leshkevich, who tracks the ice for the research laboratory. \u201cAll the lakes seem pretty brutal.\u201dIt has created nightmarish troubles for vessels that must continue to attempt runs through the worst of winter.Truck and train cargo that is too dangerous or too large for the bridge and tunnels spanning the international border between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, must instead travel the Detroit River. But dense ice stopped the Detroit-Windsor Truck Ferry for 31 days this year, 25 of them consecutively. At one point the ferry\u2019s tug was stuck in Windsor with its barge separately frozen to a dock in Detroit.Ed Bernard, vice president of the Toronto-based Precision Specialized Division, a heavy haul company, said he waited more than two weeks to ferry across the river sections of large chimneys destined for Ohio.Gregg Ward, the co-owner of the ferry, said, \u201cOur expenses continue, so it\u2019s a tragedy for us. By the time this is over, we\u2019ve lost 20 percent of the year.\u201dAs the thaw gets underway, the shipping situation can actually worsen if wind causes ice to pile up in stacks. \u201cI\u2019ve been on a 235-foot Coast Guard ship going full speed ahead, and when it hit one of those, the ship shuddered to a stop,\u201d said Lt. Davey Connor of the Coast Guard district in Cleveland, which is responsible for the Great Lakes.Many companies are now playing the waiting game.A United States Coast Guard icebreaker made initial attempts at breaking up ice last week in the port here. Eight imposing grain elevators, which collectively have the largest storage capacity in North America, make the Thunder Bay port an important hub for Canadian exports heading to the Atlantic Ocean.Once again this year, the season\u2019s first ships will not get loaded in March as they normally are. As the Canadian Wheat Board\u2019s elevator nears capacity, Paul Kennedy, its manager, says that he may soon be forced to stop daily unloadings of 90 or so rail cars, which have come from the western part of the country.\u201cThey\u2019re starting to hunt and peck a little bit for space,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said of his employees in the concrete elevator. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get to the point where you can\u2019t unload any more cars and you\u2019ve got loaded cars sitting on track.\u201dRailroads impose a $100-a-day charge for every loaded but idle car stuck on their tracks. Last year, when shipping didn\u2019t start in Thunder Bay until April 26, Mr. Kennedy estimates that about 2,000 rail cars destined for the eight grain elevators along the city\u2019s shoreline were backed up in rail yards.The delays are just as painful for the companies that depend on the various commodities.Robert Lewis-Manning, the president of the Canadian Shipowners Association, said that last year, two large steel makers \u201cwere getting awfully close to having to lay off people\u201d because their stockpiles of iron ore, coal and coke almost ran out in the spring. He declined to identify the companies.As his fleet of 22 ships gears up to resume service, Allister Paterson, the president of Canada Steamship Lines, said he expected that the most anxious customers would be suppliers and users of road salt along the lakes and the east coast of North America. With their stocks all but wiped out, such players will need to immediately start the long process of rebuilding.\u201cThey were still recovering from last year, trying to get inventories up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now we have another brutal winter, so I suspect they will be in a restocking mode for quite a while.\u201dIan Austen reported from Thunder Bay, Ontario, and Mary M. Chapman from Detroit.Advertisement"}

In doing so, Podemos runs the risk of selling its soul and alienating its core support among Spain\u2019s discontented and disenfranchised, who have thrust the fledgling party to prominence with meteoric speed.Mr. Iglesias welcomes comparisons between Podemos and Syriza, but he has been careful to distance Podemos from anti-establishment parties on the right that have made similarly big strides riding voter dissatisfaction with Brussels, like the United Kingdom Independence Party in Britain or the National Front in France.\u201cWe\u2019re perhaps all part of a general situation of dissatisfaction with the politics of Europe, but the big difference is that we are democratic, pro-European and clearly not racist,\u201d Mr. Iglesias said.\u201cPolitical forces like Podemos and Syriza provide among the last opportunities to convince citizens that something positive can still be achieved within a European Union project,\u201d he added.Since then, Podemos has made further gains in opinion polls, raising the prospect of the most open race in Spain\u2019s modern history in a busy voting year that starts this month with a regional election in Andalusia and culminates in a general election around November.Since presenting his party\u2019s program last year, which read like a long wish list, Mr. Iglesias has begun softening some claims, notably over whether an ailing country was entitled to renege on its debt.Instead, Mr. Iglesias now says debt repayment schedules should be \u201clinked to growth,\u201d spread out long enough to ensure that a country does not fall deeper into recession. \u201cDebts have to be paid, but it\u2019s got to be in a viable way,\u201d he said.The program also calls for new taxes on the wealthy and on financial transactions. It promises higher pensions and salaries, as well as a rise in spending on health care, education and other social services \u2014 without, however, elaborating on how those plans would be paid for.\u201cWe stood in the European elections, but now we have to be a lot more precise and assume the responsibility of governing a state in very difficult conditions,\u201d Mr. Iglesias said. \u201cOur program can\u2019t just be promises and good intentions.\u201dSpain, however, is not in the same situation as Greece, whose Syriza-led government has been tussling with its creditors and European Union partners over how to avoid defaulting on its debt.Instead, Mr. Rajoy recently told lawmakers that Spain\u2019s economy, which has inched out of recession, had \u201ccome out of the nightmare\u201d and was now growing more strongly than that of any other major European nation, even at just 1.4 percent for all of 2014.In a thinly veiled reference to Podemos, Mr. Rajoy told Parliament that \u201cwith demagogy, you don\u2019t maintain the welfare state, you destroy it.\u201dMr. Iglesias had a ready riposte, noting before a gathering of party faithful that many families still struggled to get by. \u201cThe nightmare, Mr. Rajoy, is the reality of our country,\u201d he declared.While Mr. Rajoy is hoping to convince voters that the country\u2019s economic turnaround is meaningful, Mr. Iglesias insists that the benefits of Spain\u2019s return to growth are being felt only by \u201cthe old privileged elite.\u201dIt is the kind of argument \u2014 often made with a ready arsenal of facts and figures in the style of the university professor he is \u2014 that one would expect of a man named for Pablo Iglesias, the 19th-century father of Spanish Socialism.But the media-savvy Mr. Iglesias, a regular presence on television chat shows even before he started Podemos, is the first to admit that to win a general election, Podemos must move beyond its radical roots.\u201cI come from the left, but current society should no longer be understood in terms of right and left, but in terms of those who are above and those who are below, the privileged elite and the majority,\u201d he said.Indeed, his criticism of Spain\u2019s long-established Socialist Party, until now the largest opposition party, has been equally unsparing, threatening to divide the opposition vote in ways that could buoy Mr. Rajoy.Mr. Iglesias called Podemos \u201cthe real opposition,\u201d charging that the Socialists had rubber-stamped the austerity program imposed by Mr. Rajoy\u2019s governing Popular Party. \u201cIn economic terms, these two parties have been in an agreement,\u201d he said.Though a leader of his own party was recently embroiled in accusations of fraud, Mr. Iglesias also says the mainstream parties share the blame for \u201callowing us to reach levels of corruption that are scandalous.\u201dSince the economic tide went out with the financial crisis of 2008, more than 150 corruption cases involving politicians of all stripes have proliferated around the country.But as elections quickly approach, Mr. Iglesias acknowledged that his party faced growing pains.On the one hand, he is eager to oust Mr. Rajoy as soon as possible, especially in a fast-fragmenting political landscape that also now features another rising party, Ciudadanos, led by a youthful Catalan leader.On the other hand, Podemos, founded by a handful of university academics, has been scrambling to select candidates and build its basic party machinery. \u201cIn ideal circumstances, we would like to have more time, but citizens are asking us for change now,\u201d Mr. Iglesias said.But even as he pours scorn on Mr. Rajoy and other mainstream politicians from what he calls \u201cthe caste,\u201d Mr. Iglesias already has his eye on what it would take to govern, if it came down to it.For a man who has cast himself as an outsider, Mr. Iglesias sounded curiously pragmatic about forming possible coalitions, should no party emerge as a clear victor from this year\u2019s elections.\u201cWe are not sectarian and our hand is held out to all who want to change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will always reach out to any party willing to recognize that what they have been doing until now simply didn\u2019t work.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Christians Loving Jews", "Date": "2015-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHE was almost lost in the whirl of lawmakers, pundits, plutocrats and other boldface names who showed up for Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress last week. But the presence of Pat Boone was a key to understanding why John Boehner was playing a smart game of party politics to stand so solidly with the Israeli prime minister.I\u2019m referring to Boone the singer. But I really mean Boone the churchman. He\u2019s a prominent figure among, and megaphone for, American\u2019s evangelical Christians, who listened to Netanyahu\u2019s remarks as closely and adoringly as any constituency in this country.And days earlier, on a radio show, Boone described Netanyahu as a friend who was well aware that evangelical Christians constitute some of \u201cIsrael\u2019s most staunch supporters,\u201d numbering \u201cin the tens of millions in the United States.\u201dHe\u2019s correct in that analysis, which was strangely missing from much of the media coverage of and commentary about the Netanyahu-Boehner alliance.Yes, Boehner\u2019s invitation to Netanyahu, rendered independently of the White House, was a way to get under President Obama\u2019s skin and in President Obama\u2019s way. And, yes, that provocation was manna to the most conservative House Republicans, who sometimes chafe under Boehner\u2019s leadership.The prompt for all that clapping? Representative Doug Lamborn, a Colorado Republican, spoke up to thank Boehner for weathering attacks from the White House in order to make Netanyahu\u2019s speech happen.What part of Colorado does Lamborn represent? Colorado Springs, which is a Republican stronghold, famous for its concentration of evangelical Christians.JEWS in the Democratic Party are more divided on the actions that conservative Israeli leaders like Netanyahu have taken in defense of Israel than evangelical Christians in the Republican Party are.And that helps to explain the tightened bond between Israel and Republicans over the last few decades.We in the media often look past that to focus on the influence of a handful of rich Jewish Republican donors for whom Israel is a priority. Foremost among them is Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate. He almost single-handedly kept Newt Gingrich\u2019s 2012 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination financed and alive.And a year ago, when Chris Christie joined other potential Republican presidential candidates to give speeches to the Republican Jewish Coalition, he had to ask Adelson\u2019s forgiveness after using the phrase \u201coccupied territories\u201d in reference to land where Palestinians live but Israel maintains a military presence.But the bigger story is Israel\u2019s importance to evangelical Christians.\u201cChristian Zionism as a sentiment is not new,\u201d said Dan Senor, a Republican foreign policy adviser who has traveled to Israel with Mitt Romney, Chris Christie and other Republican candidates. \u201cBut as a movement, it has grown exponentially in size and political sophistication over the past 15 years.\u201dIn early 2013, when Obama nominated Chuck Hagel, a Republican, to become the next defense secretary, and Hagel\u2019s support for Israel was called into question, one of the groups lobbying against him in greatest number and at greatest volume was Christians United for Israel.Its founder and chairman, John Hagee, was in Washington, D.C., with his wife last week at Netanyahu\u2019s speech. They were Adelson\u2019s guests.Senor told me that in 2009, when he was promoting a book that he co-wrote, \u201cStart-Up Nation,\u201d about the modern Israeli economy, Christian radio shows extended as many invitations to him as Jewish groups did.Some evangelical Christians\u2019 interest in Israel reflects an interpretation of the Bible\u2019s prophetic passages that\u2019s known as premillennial dispensationalism. It maintains that the End of Days can play out as God intends only if Jews govern Israel and have reconstructed a temple on the Temple Mount, where there\u2019s now a mosque.But just a subset of evangelicals subscribe to that. Others are motivated by their belief, rooted in scripture, that God always intended Israel for Jews and that honoring that and keeping Israel safe is a way of honoring God. God\u2019s blessing of America, they feel, cannot be divorced from America\u2019s backing of Israel.The conservative Christian television preacher Pat Robertson once publicly suggested that Ariel Sharon had suffered a stroke and that Yitzhak Rabin had been assassinated because both of these former Israeli prime ministers had pursued policies of \u201cdividing God\u2019s land.\u201d\u201cThere are evangelical connections to the land,\u201d said Russell Moore, the president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.The attacks of 9/11 and the spreading threat of Islamic extremists have further strengthened American evangelicals\u2019 sense of kinship with Jews in Israel, whom they see as crucial partners in fighting butchers who have recently singled out Christians for slaughter.Moore told me that American evangelical leaders are routinely trying to get American lawmakers to focus on anti-Semitism around the globe. He said that when he joined the prominent evangelical pastor Rick Warren and the lawyer (and Clinton adversary) Ken Starr last week on a panel at Georgetown University to discuss religious issues, anti-Semitism came up immediately.That\u2019s a climate and a context that are essential to understanding fully the bear hug in which Boehner wrapped Bibi. He wasn\u2019t merely welcoming a world leader. He was doing in the arena of foreign policy what he tries and sometimes fails to do with domestic issues: keeping the base in buoyant spirits.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warnings Raised of a Greek Exit From the Euro", "Date": "2015-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Just a few weeks ago, fears that Greece might exit the euro union subsided when Europe extended its financial bailout. But as a new war of words escalates between Athens and its creditors, talk of a \u201cGrexit\u201d is heating up.In the last several days, European and American banks, think tanks and ratings agencies have issued a fresh round of warnings and studies calculating the damage to the currency union if Greece were to default on its debts or stop using the euro.Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup body of European finance ministers, this week also raised the possibility of restricting the flow of money in and out of Greece to make sure the country has enough money to pay its debts.Driving those concerns is an increasingly venomous standoff between Athens and nearly every other country in the 19-member currency union \u2014 especially Germany.One of the main sticking points is Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s pushing ahead with an anti-austerity agenda that creditors say conflicts with pledges he made on Feb. 20 in winning an agreement to let Greece extend its 240 billion euro, or $254 billion, bailout program for four months. That deal was crucial to giving Greece the ability to unlock loan money it badly needs. But so far, no funds have been forthcoming.On Wednesday, Greece\u2019s Parliament approved a number of anti-poverty measures despite warnings from creditors that the legislation ran contrary to the overall package of changes Greece had agreed last month to adopt.And it probably did not help Greece\u2019s debt diplomacy that members of Mr. Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party were among the thousands of European demonstrators in Frankfurt on Wednesday protesting, amid tear gas, European Central Bank policies.Athens has become so politically isolated, even as its coffers run dry, that Mr. Tsipras will be trying to salvage relationships on Thursday and Friday in Brussels at a European Union summit meeting.He has persuaded Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany; President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France; the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi; and others to discuss the Greek crisis directly with him. Whether he will clinch a deal to unlock funds and prevent a wider crisis remains to be seen.Europe has \u201can overwhelming will to keep Greece in the eurozone,\u201d Pierre Moscovici, the European Commission\u2019s financial affairs chief, told a German newspaper this week. But, he added, \u201cwe won\u2019t keep Greece in the eurozone at any price.\u201dMembers of Mr. Varoufakis\u2019s Syriza party, meanwhile, are also agitated over a recent opulent photo shoot of him in the magazine Paris Match.On Tuesday, Greece further angered its creditors by refusing to update them on progress it had made since the February deal to put in place economic changes required to free up around \u20ac7 billion in funds from Greece\u2019s bailout program. Instead, Mr. Tsipras insisted on waiting to speak directly to Ms. Merkel and others about it in Brussels.The government teeters precipitously close to a default. On Friday, Greece must reimburse \u20ac350 million in loans to the International Monetary Fund and roll over \u20ac1.6 billion in short-term debt.Tax receipts have fallen by more than \u20ac1 billion since the Syriza party came to power in January. In the face of the cash squeeze, the state has said it might have to borrow money from national pension and farmers\u2019 funds to avoid default, and withhold back payments owed to hospitals and other state entities.Several of Greece\u2019s largest companies are also privately complaining that the state has not paid them millions of euros owed for construction and other state contracts since December.A number of large and medium Greek companies have started withdrawing cash overnight from their Greek bank accounts to banks in London, Luxembourg and elsewhere, and returning the money in the morning to finance their business operations, according to Athens-based analysts, bankers and Greek company officials aware of the transfers. All declined to speak for attribution.The practice \u2014 which is legal and was last used widely by Greek companies and multinationals with Greek operations in 2012, when fears of a Greek euro exit ran high \u2014 is meant to protect the companies\u2019 euro holdings in case capital controls are imposed overnight or over a weekend in Greece, or in the event of some other financial calamity, these people said.Greek officials have insisted that capital controls will not be imposed in Greece \u2014 or will be applied only if the situation grows dire. But Mr. Dijsselbloem raised the issue again on Tuesday in an interview with BNR Nieuwsradio of the Netherlands, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s been explored what should happen if a country gets into deep trouble \u2014 that doesn\u2019t immediately have to be an exit scenario.\u201dHe cited \u201cradical measures\u201d taken in Cyprus, where banks \u201cwere closed for a while and capital flows within and out of the country were tied to all kinds of conditions.\u201dMr. Tsipras has insisted that Greece does not want to leave the eurozone, and European officials have chimed in to insist that the currency bloc must stay together. The ultimate goal is for Greece to get a \u20ac7 billion loan installment to tide it over until summer.Greece would then hope to return as quickly as possible to borrowing in international financial markets so that it needed no further aid from its European partners, according to a senior Greek finance official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. But Greece would need to overcome a sizable credibility gap for that to happen \u2014 and to quell the Grexit talk.Mr. Moscovici, in his interview with German news media, said a Greek departure from the single currency would raise the question of whether the eurozone could remain a viable currency union. \u201cEveryone would ask, \u2018Which member state is next?\u2019\u201d he said.Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research note on Tuesday that the faster that Greece\u2019s situation deteriorates, the greater the chance it may exit the union. \u201cThe economy is now shrinking, tax revenues are falling short of targets, bank deposits are leaving the system and political volatility seems on the rise, both domestically and in the relations with official lenders,\u201d the bank said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that Greece would want to exit the euro. Yet a misstep big enough may force the exit.\u201dBut back in Athens, Mr. Tsipras remained defiant.Addressing lawmakers before the vote Wednesday on a \u201chumanitarian crisis bill,\u201d which promises free electricity and food aid for thousands of very poor Greek families, Mr. Tsipras condemned \u201cthose who dare to write a letter and send it by email, describing the bill for the humanitarian crisis as a unilateral move.\u201dHe was referring to a note that a European Commission official sent to Athens on Tuesday calling for further discussions of the proposed measure.\u201cThey\u2019re asking us to freeze legislation so that thousands of families without electricity can continue to freeze,\u201d Mr. Tsipras told Parliament on Wednesday. \u201cPeople have asked us to put an end to austerity and bailout agreements, to begin the process of reclaiming the dignity of the nation.\u201dNiki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}

No,\u201d said Martin Panza, the New York Racing Association\u2019s senior vice president for racing operations. \u201cBut there is a side to it, and that side is that it creates a lot of jobs, and those jobs are taxpaying jobs for the state.\u201d\u201cIt would be foolish, based on one of the worst winters we\u2019ve had in decades and decades, to start making judgment calls as to why we are doing winter racing,\u201d said Richard Violette Jr., president of the New York Thoroughbred Horsemen\u2019s Association.Violette has about 30 horses training in New York. But he, too, chose to stay away with his top horse, Upstart, who is regarded as a top Kentucky Derby contender. Upstart is being prepared at Palm Meadows Training Center in Boynton Beach, Fla., and being pointed toward the Florida Derby on March 29 as his final prep race.At Aqueduct, a 25-person grounds crew, supplemented by additional workers, labored to get the track into shape for the Gotham, a Grade III prep race intended to put some horses on the road to the Derby.Glen Kozak, vice president for facilities and racing surfaces, said work began at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday with an emphasis on clearing snow to improve drainage. He estimated that a few hundred tons of sand were added to the surface. The track was twice harrowed throughout the night.Track officials said they did not have estimates on how much revenue had been lost as a result of the 15 cancellations \u2014 by comparison, there were seven days lost last winter \u2014 or the costs associated with the extraordinary amount of maintenance required.Violette said Aqueduct should consider installing a synthetic surface if \u201cthere is evidence that a synthetic track would provide us with a safer surface on which to race.\u201dMike Repole, a New York native and a high-profile owner, questioned whether Aqueduct, an antiquated track in Queens next to a bustling casino, was worthy of investment. He favors expanding the casino and turning nearby Belmont Park, a more inviting venue in Nassau County, into a year-round site.\u201cIt would be better for the fans, the horses and the horsemen,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Tug Captain, Job That Runs in Family Turns Deadly Off Long Island", "Date": "2015-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was rain, thick fog and an ocean swell \u2014 in other words, just another day on the water for Donald Maloney, 60, as the Sea Bear, the tugboat he was captaining, traveled along the South Shore of Long Island on Saturday.The Sea Bear, which had three other crew members, had finished a dredging job in a bay just west of the Hamptons, and the blue and white tug was headed toward New York Harbor to pick up a barge.The tug was about a mile from the Pines section of Fire Island, a few miles south of where Mr. Maloney grew up in a tugboat family in Farmingville, N.Y. He was scampering onto tugboats while still in diapers and accompanying his father, Donald Sr., also a captain, on the family\u2019s tug.\u201cDonnie came from a long tradition of tugs in our family,\u201d recalled Kevin Maloney, 58, one of Mr. Maloney\u2019s four brothers, and also a tug captain himself. \u201cYou\u2019d be hard pressed to find a better captain out there, especially in a difficult situation.\u201dSuch a situation was now coming, as the Sea Bear suddenly began to take on water for reasons that are still unclear. The ocean, with water temperatures in the 30s, would swallow the heavy steel vessel within minutes.Mr. Maloney\u2019s crew members were able to put on insulated survival gear, known as immersion suits, that would help them avoid hypothermia. They went into the water and awaited rescue. Mr. Maloney, who had been a captain nearly all of his adult life, was apparently bent on trying to save the vessel. He finally abandoned ship but was unable to put on his suit.In the icy water, he quite likely died within minutes and was separated from his bobbing crew, the authorities said. He was found about three hours later by another tugboat crew that had responded to the Sea Bear\u2019s Mayday call.\u201cI\u2019ve pulled up a dead man crushed between two barges; I\u2019ve had a deckhand with his fingers ripped off,\u201d Kevin Maloney recalled. \u201cYou teach young guys that once they step on that deck, anything can happen.\u201dThe Sea Bear was one of hundreds of tugs that ply the waterways in and around New York Harbor, along the Hudson River and on Long Island Sound. They are the muscle that powers the vibrant maritime economy, ushering millions of tons of cargo and fuel moving through the region\u2019s waters.Compactly built around a large engine, tugboats do the heavy pushing, pulling and guiding for work boats, tankers, freighters and cruise ships, crudely shoving them through strong currents and chop but also delicately steering them into narrow berths.Crews often remain together, sleeping on board, and shifts can last weeks or even months.The Sea Bear, a 62-foot-long boat built in 1991, was one of the harbor\u2019s smaller tugs. Its 1,000-horsepower diesel engine was more than adequate for working with barges, as well as maneuvering and assisting work boats.Donald Maloney had been captaining the Sea Bear for about five months. He worked with the same crew, two weeks on and two weeks off, and was close to them. They were nearly at the end of a two-week shift on Saturday.\u201cHe was trying to do something about the situation, and something unfortunately happened that precluded him\u201d from getting into his survival suit, said the executive, who spoke on the condition that his name not be published because of the delicate nature of the situation.Soon after the distress signal, Coast Guard vessels rushed to the location. Suffolk police officials said that their rescue boats were prevented from responding because of icy waterways, and that the agency\u2019s helicopter was unable to fly because of poor weather conditions.The surviving crewmates \u2014 Lars Vetland, 43, of Staten Island; Jason Reimer, 38, of Leonardo, N.J.; and Rainer Bendixen, 22, of Bay Head, N.J. \u2014 were not injured, the authorities said. None would return calls requesting comment. A woman who answered the door at the address of Mr. Vetland\u2019s home on Staten Island, when asked how he was feeling, said, \u201cHave you ever tread water for three hours?\u201dMr. Maloney was taken to the Fire Island Coast Guard station, where he was pronounced dead.The survivors were in the water for about two hours before being rescued by the Coast Guard, the authorities said.Coast Guard officials said on Tuesday that they were still trying to determine what caused the tug to sink, and that they were conducting an investigation that would include recovering the boat from the ocean floor.Kevin Maloney said he was angered at widely published news reports describing his brother as having panicked and going into the water without putting on his immersion suit. \u201cI can assure you Donnie didn\u2019t panic \u2014 he\u2019s been in plenty of situations like this over the years,\u201d he said.The Wittich Brothers executive said that he had listened to the crew\u2019s account, and that they said Mr. Maloney \u201cshowed complete valor to the very end.\u201dThe Maloney family grew up talking tugboats around the dinner table, Kevin Maloney said. Their father, a tug owner, would take the family on vacations on the Hudson while he pulled barges.Donald Maloney worked as a deckhand on his father\u2019s tug, the Altoona, after high school, and began working as a captain a few years later. He worked for a half-dozen tugboat companies and became known as an easygoing but firm captain, widely respected for his skill and adamant about teaching new deck hands about the importance of safety, Kevin Maloney said.\u201cHe broke in a lot of guys,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cHe knew his stuff and he knew how to deal with tough situations.\u201dThe Maloney family has had many close calls.In summer 1960, Donald Sr., who died in 2007, was forced into the waters of the Hell Gate section of the East River along with a dozen other crew members after their tug, the Devon, was rammed by a tanker. Steven Maloney, Donald and Kevin\u2019s brother, was nearly killed when a tug he was working on sank in the Cape Cod Canal in 1983.Kevin Maloney shared these stories from his home in Sayville, N.Y., on Monday. The Cape-style house was decorated in a nautical theme and adorned with photos of the family\u2019s life on the water.\u201cIt was his passion,\u201d he said of his brother Donald. \u201cHe was doing the profession he loved.\u201dWhen Kevin Maloney learned of his brother\u2019s death on Saturday, he was at work, pushing oil barges in New York Harbor. Still, he completed his shift, because \u201cyou have to finish what needs to be done.\u201dRuth Bashinsky and Nate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tunisian Museum Attack Leads to Firing of Chiefs", "Date": "2015-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an interview in his office in the old city of Tunis, the prime minister said he had removed the chiefs after visiting the museum with a group of top officials on Sunday. He said he had found lapses in security even after the attack, the country\u2019s worst terrorist assault in more than a decade.\u201cI went to look close up and see how things function,\u201d he said. \u201cWe told the interior minister there are failings and we have to prevent another catastrophe.\u201d There were problems in controlling access to the compound that houses the National Bardo Museum, a historic palace that has a large collection of Roman mosaics, and the parliament buildings, he said, adding that the police lacked the means to enforce adequate security.The attack at the museum on Wednesday \u2014 in which two gunmen fatally shot 20 cruise ship passengers from Japan, Poland, Italy, Colombia and elsewhere \u2014 has shaken both the country and the new Tunisian government.Tunisia successfully held legislative and presidential elections last fall and seemed set for a brighter future after completing a difficult transition since the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. Mr. Essid, 66, has been in office barely more than one month, and President Beji Caid Essebsi, the first democratically elected president of the country, only three months.Contrary to reports last week that the gunmen had been heading for parliament, the attack was aimed specifically at Tunisia\u2019s tourist industry, its main source of foreign exchange, and at destabilizing its democratic and economic transition, Mr. Essid said. \u201cThey wanted to attack an economic sector that is very important for Tunisia, a sector that is already in difficulties, and try to sink once and for all the economic development of the country.\u201dThe police and staff members at the museum said that the gunmen appeared to single out the foreign tourists, noting that Tunisian museum employees, including people at the reception area, were spared. The gunmen began shooting at tourists emerging from buses and when police forces began arriving, the men tossed grenades and retreated into the museum, he said. They fatally shot an officer and his dog outside the museum. \u201cThe objective was to prevent the economy of the country reaping a good harvest because everything is there to succeed,\u201d Mr. Essid said. \u201cNow the country is going to cross the last stage of the transition towards economic and social development of the country and they wanted by this barbaric act to block, to prevent this political transition.\u201d\u201cI always say democracy is good, but it has to deliver. They do not want democracy to deliver,\u201d he said.In the days since the attack, the government has come under criticism for not providing better security at such a prominent site in the heart of the capital.Mr. Essid said the gunmen had slipped through the front gate of the compound and taken advantage of a moment when tourist buses were pulling in, then had hidden behind them as the police were occupied. Nevertheless, counterterrorism police garrisoned nearby responded quickly and effectively to save many lives, Mr. Essid said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Award Goes to Muslim Televangelist Who Harshly Criticizes U.S.", "Date": "2015-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 He has publicly declared that \u201cthe Jews\u201d control America, that apostates can be killed, that the United States is the world\u2019s \u201cbiggest terrorist\u201d and that the Sept. 11 attacks were an \u201cinside job\u201d by President George W. Bush.But last weekend, Dr. Zakir Naik, a prominent Muslim televangelist from India, appeared at an elaborate ceremony at a luxury hotel in Saudi Arabia, where the new monarch, King Salman, gave him one of the country\u2019s highest honors.The award for \u201cservice to Islam\u201d highlighted the conflicted position of Saudi Arabia as an American ally that continues to back Islamists who espouse hatred of the West.Scrutiny of Saudi Arabia\u2019s role in shaping thought in the Muslim world has grown with the rise of the Islamic State extremist group in Iraq and Syria, which shares some aspects of the fundamentalist Islam propagated by the Saudi state.Saudi officials reject any comparison to the Islamic State, noting that they are on its hit list and that they have joined the American-led coalition that is bombing the group.But despite longstanding ties between the United States and the Saudi royal family, the gap between what the two countries consider appropriate religious rhetoric was clear in the public celebration of Dr. Naik.Reached by phone in Saudi Arabia on Monday, Dr. Naik said he was proud to join the \u201cicons of the Muslim world\u201d who had received the award. He remained harshly critical of the United States.Dr. Naik, a thin man with a wispy beard and a penchant for dark suits, has made his name internationally through colloquial lectures about Islam, the religion\u2019s links to science and why he considers it superior to other faiths.Thomas Blom Hansen, a professor of anthropology at Stanford University who studies religion in India and who met Dr. Naik in India in the late 1990s, said that the televangelist struck a chord with some upwardly mobile Muslims who liked his combative way of defending their religion. But, he said, Dr. Naik is not a jihadist directly calling for violence.\u201cHe is a conservative for sure, but is he someone who would endorse people going to Syria, for example? That is not my view,\u201d Dr. Hansen said.A journalist who covers Mumbai\u2019s Muslims for a prominent Indian newspaper said that Dr. Naik was controversial at home, where opinion is divided on his puritanical views.\u201cHe promoted the supremacy of Islam, and when he is in dialogue with the heads of other religions, he talks about how Islam is superior to all other religions,\u201d the journalist said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing his sources.Dr. Naik often deflects when talking about Muslim violence. Asked by phone about the Islamic State, he said he was against its actions if the media had reported them correctly, although he said he had no way of knowing.\u201cIf he is terrorizing America the terrorist, the biggest terrorist, I am with him,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery Muslim should be a terrorist.\u201d\u201cThe Jews are a minority less than 5 percent in America, but they are controlling the economy, they are controlling America,\u201d he said.When asked on Monday about the accusations, Dr. Naik said he had been misquoted.\u201cPeople say Muslims have done it, and some others said Bush had done it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut who knows who did it?\u201dSaudi watchers were unsurprised that the kingdom would honor a harsh critic of its American allies, noting that many members of the Saudi religious establishment hold similar views.\u201cIf you ask them their opinions about America, they would share lots of Zakir Naik\u2019s opinions,\u201d said St\u00e9phane Lacroix, an associate professor at Sciences Po in Paris who studies Saudi Arabia. \u201cBut usually they don\u2019t talk about it.\u201dDr. Naik\u2019s positions have caused him trouble before. In 2010, both Canada and Britain denied him entry for speaking engagements.Theresa May, the British home secretary, said then that \u201cnumerous comments made by Dr. Naik are evidence to me of his unacceptable behavior.\u201dOn Monday, Dr. Naik blamed Christian missionaries who fear that letting him in will cause Christians to convert to Islam.\u201cI know, and that is why I haven\u2019t even tried going to these countries,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can hear me on the Internet.\u201dSuhasini Raj contributed reporting from New Delhi, and Neha Thirani Bagri from Mumbai, India.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Good News on the Deficit, This Time Because of Private Insurance Health Premiums", "Date": "2015-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthEstimates for government health care spending keep coming down.That could eventually be not only a boon for consumers, but it could also have big implications for the federal budget: If the Congressional Budget Office is right, the amount the federal government pays for health insurance in the coming years will be hundreds of billions of dollars lower than it recently forecast, meaning a much smaller federal deficit.Over the last few years, the Congressional Budget Office has been gradually lowering its estimates of how much Medicare, the government insurance program for the elderly and disabled, will spend to care for people. Taken together, the size of those reductions is huge \u2014 dwarfing nearly any other deficit reduction proposal under discussion in Washington today.Today\u2019s announcement about private insurance amounts to an effective deficit reduction on a similar scale, but it came all at once. Precise math is hard, given how the budget office\u2019s estimates are provided, but it appears that the federal government is now estimating it will spend about $300 billion less over the next 10 years because of lower health insurance premiums.The federal government pays for private health insurance in two major ways. It subsidizes the premiums of people who get their insurance through work by making that portion of their pay tax-free. And it helps pay the cost of premiums for middle-income people who buy their own insurance on Obamacare\u2019s insurance marketplaces, on a sliding scale according to income. When private insurance gets more expensive, as it typically does, the federal government must pay more for its share of the premiums.What the budget office said Monday is that private insurance premiums are going to grow much more slowly than it previously estimated. That means that the government will be paying out less to subsidize people\u2019s private premiums in the marketplaces \u2014 and will be collecting a greater fraction of workers\u2019 total compensation in income taxes as people get paid relatively more in cash and less in health insurance.There are some other factors in the Obamacare reduction; the savings can\u2019t be entirely explained by the premium reductions. And there are a few related phenomena that cut the other way: Lowered premiums also mean that fewer companies will end up paying a \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on expensive insurance under the Obamacare law, an estimated loss of $62 billion. And as some companies stop offering insurance to their workers, the savings to the federal government will get smaller.The change, of course, means that the health reform law is now forecast to cost the government substantially less than originally expected. The net savings to the program could be about $142 billion over 10 years.The growing cost of health care has been effectively erasing pay raises for workers. It\u2019s also driving up the federal deficit and crowding out other state budget obligations, like education. The budget offices\u2019s estimates are just that \u2014 estimates. But they point to a welcome economic trend: one in which health care won\u2019t keep gobbling up more and more of the money needed for other priorities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Premier Vows Tougher Regulation on Air Pollution", "Date": "2015-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Premier Li Keqiang of China said on Sunday that the government was failing to satisfy public demands to stanch pollution and would impose heavier punishments to cut the toxic smog that was the subject of a popular documentary belatedly banned by censors.The premier\u2019s news conference at the end of the annual full meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress has become a fixture of the Chinese political calendar, cast as a show of political candor and accountability. But the briefings have mostly become a stilted ritual, with questions generally preselected and massaged to avoid the airing of controversies about legal rights, corruption scandals and other themes unwelcome by Communist Party leaders.This year\u2019s conference was no different. But Mr. Li took one reporter\u2019s question about air pollution, which mentioned the banned documentary, \u201cUnder the Dome,\u201d and he acknowledged that there was a gap between the government\u2019s efforts and public ire about pervasive smog.\u201cThis is a concern that is uppermost on all people\u2019s minds,\u201d Mr. Li said in response to a question from a Huffington Post reporter, who asked about the government\u2019s struggle to clean up the environment.\u201cThe Chinese government is determined to tackle smog and environmental pollution as a whole,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cBut the progress we have made still falls far short of the expectation of the people. Last year, I said the Chinese government would declare war against environmental pollution. We\u2019re determined to carry forward our efforts until we achieve our goal.\u201dThe sky over Beijing was pale blue on Sunday, though a brownish haze smudged the horizon, and the capital\u2019s air was rated \u201cunhealthy\u201d by a United States Embassy air monitor. And even with clearer skies during some of the legislative session, pollution has loomed as an issue.Mr. Li pointedly made no mention of \u201cUnder the Dome\u201d and its banning. But he acknowledged some of the problems raised by the documentary, especially lax enforcement of pollution restrictions by environmental agencies too weak to take on state energy conglomerates. Mr. Li said the government would fully enforce the newly amended environmental protection legislation.\u201cAll acts of illegal production and emissions will be brought to justice and held accountable,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cWe need to make businesses that illicitly emit and dump pay a price too heavy to bear. We must ensure that the enforcement of the environmental protection law is not a stick of cotton candy but a powerful mace.\u201dThough a reporter had asked about it, Mr. Li avoided directly blaming state-owned enterprises, including the big oil companies, that many environmental advocates say are blocking policies and stifling the enforcement of regulations designed to protect the environment. But Mr. Li said the government would work to fully implement the Environmental Pollution Law, which allows for greater fines against polluters and which environmental advocates had praised when details were announced months ago.Mr. Li has made similar remarks on various issues \u2014 the environment, official corruption and the economy \u2014 three years in a row now, ever since holding the first of these scripted news conferences in March 2013 after taking the post of prime minister.On Sunday he issued targets for reducing carbon dioxide intensity \u2014 the amount of the greenhouse gas emitted for each unit of economic activity \u2014 by 3.1 percent, and he said the government would introduce legislation for a long-discussed \u201cenvironmental protection tax.\u201dDiscussion of public anger about the pollution was, however, mostly muted throughout the National People\u2019s Congress. The Communist Party-controlled legislature has 2,965 delegates, overwhelmingly handpicked party members and officials, who meet in full session once a year to discuss and, inevitably, approve the government\u2019s plans. Even so, some of the public frustration crept into the meeting.The environment minister, Chen Jining, who took office in recent weeks, has also acknowledged the government\u2019s failings.Right after the online release of \u201cUnder the Dome,\u201d Mr. Chen praised it as akin to \u201cSilent Spring,\u201d the landmark 1962 book that energized the environmental movement in the United States. But on March 7, one day after censors banned the documentary, Mr. Chen avoided any mention of the film at what appeared to be a carefully scripted news conference.Edward Wong reported from Beijing, and Chris Buckley from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sri Lanka\u2019s Tamil Minority Grows Impatient With Just Promises ", "Date": "2015-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJaffna JournalJAFFNA, Sri Lanka \u2014 There may be no place more beautiful on the breathtaking tropical island of Sri Lanka than the white sand beaches along the Palka Strait, which is why building a luxury resort here made sense.The resort\u2019s website recommends ordering from the menu in advance \u2014 it does not say how far in advance \u2014 at the Palmyra restaurant, where \u201cin addition to deferent style of choosing, you are offered Jaffna special dished that give you the real taste of Jaffna.\u201d The waiters have suspiciously short haircuts and buff builds, and food not ordered in advance, while passable, tastes like it was cooked in a military canteen because, well, it was.And then there is the nagging ethical question of whether to enjoy a landscape seized a quarter-century ago in a bloody bombardment from thousands of still-displaced families.\u201cYou visited my land? How did it look?\u201d asked Arunachalam Gunabalasingam, 69, president of a committee of families from the area, none of whom have seen, or been paid, for their property since fleeing for their lives on June 15, 1990.The promises created euphoria in dozens of refugee camps, but the giddy laughter has given way to impatience among some, anger in others, and an almost universal realization that the postwar reconciliation process here will not be brief or easy.A drive around Sri Lanka reveals that most of the military checkpoints that once pockmarked this island nation during its 30-year civil war, waged between rebels of the minority Tamil ethnic group and a government dominated by ethnic Sinhalese, are gone. But the pain from the tens of thousands of missing people and seized lands still throbs. Almost everyone has a story of loss, and only now are those stories being told in voices that rise above whispers. Roads and hotels are better, yet scars from bullets and bombs are apparent.Perhaps most disquieting is that a vast surveillance infrastructure built up under the previous government, while quiescent now, remains largely in place. The military intelligence officers who once barged daily into villages in the north with questions about movements and visitors are not nearly as nosy or aggressive, but they still wander by. Gatherings in the north, even for a child\u2019s birthday party, still require official permission.And despite the present government\u2019s promises to curtail the military\u2019s intrusive presence in the civilian economy, military-run stores, resorts, factories, swimming pools and golf courses still operate.In an interview in his office at Temple Trees, the Sri Lankan White House, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe vowed that Thalsevana and all of the military\u2019s resorts would be sold or leased to private operators.\u201cYou interested in running one?\u201d Mr. Wickremesinghe joked in the interview.Yet at Thalsevana, soldiers were still building a spacious new facility just down the beach from the original, which opened in 2010. At Marble Beach Resort near Trincomalee, an extensive staff of soldiers served only a few patrons, something that infuriates private hotel operators.\u201cNo hotelier likes competing against the government,\u201d said Suresh K. Shah, chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThey make their own rules, and their staff is free.\u201dMr. Wickremesinghe replaced much of the army\u2019s top leadership, but there is widespread speculation that his relationship with the military is strained. The military\u2019s commercial ventures on seized land provide officers not only with nice homes and vacations, but also with personal enrichment.M. A. Sumanthiran, a prominent lawyer and member of Parliament for the Tamil National Alliance, said Mr. Wickremesinghe held a private meeting with top Tamil leaders recently and told the group that he needed time to bring in new military leaders.\u201cIt looks like he\u2019s fighting with the military,\u201d Mr. Sumanthiran said.In his interview, Mr. Wickremesinghe did not respond directly when asked whether military leaders were resisting his efforts. \u201cThere is a new army commander taking over, and he needs time to settle in,\u201d he said.Strains are also starting to appear among Tamils, with growing differences about how aggressively to confront the new government, which was elected with overwhelming Tamil support.\u201cAll of the top Tamil leaders are fools,\u201d Eswarapatham Saravanapavan, a Tamil member of Parliament and managing director of the Uthayan and Sudar Oli newspapers, said during an interview in which he repeatedly referred to the new prime minister as a \u201csnake\u201d who would not keep his promises to the Tamils.With the quiet encouragement of some Tamil leaders, more than two dozen displaced families sneaked back onto their lands near Trincomalee on Jan. 9, the day after the election. The families built thatch huts using donated and well-worn materials. There was no electricity, drinking water or even a ready source of food, but all expressed great satisfaction with the barbed-wire fences delineating small parcels.Asked why she would live in surroundings more squalid than the refugee camp she had left, Manguladevi Rasamanikam, 60, said simply: \u201cThis is our land.\u201dWhether it was truly her land was uncertain. The military bulldozed homes, trees and wells, removing crucial landmarks. Some Tamil leaders acknowledged that a massive survey effort was needed; others said the families would resolve any property questions themselves.Her husband, Selappa Rasamanikam, barely moved. Suffering throat cancer, he had returned \u201cfor his ending,\u201d Ms. Rasamanikam said. With them was their 32-year-old daughter, Routhika Mohanraj, one of the couple\u2019s seven children. With one son dead in the civil war and another killed in a traffic accident, the couple must divide their property among the remaining five children. Mr. Vanathan had been held since 1991 with no charges ever filed. Now mentally and physically disabled, Mr. Vanathan only vaguely remembered his years in custody, but he said he knew he had been tortured and forced into hard labor.Tamil leaders worry that the military will refuse to release more detainees because their stories will provoke outrage.\u201cOnce you start releasing people, things could quickly spin out of the government\u2019s control,\u201d said Bhavani Fonseka, a lawyer for detainee families. \u201cBecause there is nothing to stop these people from saying they were held for 25 years, they were tortured, and they saw this other person who is now dead. Those stories could implicate people holding high office in the present government.\u201cWhat happens then?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Fed\u2019s 2009 Transcripts Reveal About Its Handling of the Recession", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "Advertisement\n\nIn the early months of that year, the Fed pressed ahead with the bold measures it had initiated in 2008 to arrest the financial crisis. By summer it had largely succeeded, and economists would later determine that the economy stopped shrinking in June. Officials then began to grapple with how the Fed could best support and hasten a recovery.The transcripts, released after a standard five-year delay, provide more than 1,800 pages of details about the deliberations led by former chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. Janet L. Yellen, now the chairwoman of the Fed, also participated as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.Over the next six years, it will eventually amass more than $4 trillion in mortgage bonds and Treasury securities.Along with Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Mr. Bernanke also notes how Bank of America got in such trouble to begin with, namely from its acquisition of Merrill Lynch during the Lehman Brothers collapse. Later, Mr. Lacker accuses Bank of America of not being forthright about when it learned of the Merrill Lynch losses. Also at the meeting, Fed officials discuss their communication strategy around inflation, and Mr. Bernanke expresses deep worry about acting in ways that would prove politically toxic. He had consulted with members of the incoming Obama administration who, he relays, had no substantive objection with the Fed moving to a more explicit inflation target, but didn\u2019t want to face political blowback. Janet L. Yellen, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, argues that being explicit about inflation goals could help assuage fears the Fed was risking hyperinflation.Also, in discussing a range of programs the Fed had implemented to try to funnel money to credit markets that had broken down during the financial crisis, Mr. Lacker, the Richmond Fed president, argues that they should rightly be undertaken by the Treasury Department rather than the Fed because they fundamentally are a tool of fiscal policy, not monetary or bank regulatory policy. Mr. Bernanke, interestingly, agrees\u2014to a point.Ms. Yellen warns of the extent of the downturn.Under the program, the Fed buys up securities backed by automobile loans, credit card debt and business debt ranging from equipment leases to commercial real estate mortgages.Three days later, the Fed announces the program's expansion to what could be as much as $1 trillion.A Fed employee responds that the Fed was constrained to some extent by the infrastructure of financial markets.Mr. Bernanke, the Fed\u2019s chairman, then jokingly proposes a solution.Richard W. Fisher, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, reports that he has called 29 corporate executives to ask how the economy is doing.This is later seen as the moment that the panic in the financial markets finally begins to subside.JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are among 10 large banks that repay their federal bailouts on the first day they are allowed to do so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tunisia\u2019s Hour of Need", "Date": "2015-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn the terrorist attack last week that took the lives of 21 people, most foreign tourists, at the National Bardo Museum, Tunisia itself was under attack. And it will remain so because it is a secular democracy in an Arab world that is not democratic and, with the exception of Lebanon\u2019s power-sharing arrangements, has never known democracy. Responsibility for the outrage was claimed by the Islamic State, although officials have identified a cell of militants with various allegiances, including the local Salafist extremist group Ansar al Shariah. The Arab world is reeling from an unprecedented wave of Islamic extremism, in part financed by sympathizers in oil-rich Persian Gulf states and unfortunately exacerbated by America\u2019s \u201cwar on terror.\u201d The West must now decide whether the young Tunisian democracy is worth saving. From Iraq to Libya, and Syria to Yemen, the status of democracy in the region is a catastrophe. Even Egypt has reverted to its authoritarian ways. Today, those in the region who have survived the mayhem yearn for a more stable Middle East, for a chance to find their way and fulfill the destinies of their peoples.Bold action, by the United States in particular, could make a significant difference. If the West perceives Tunisia as a new light in the otherwise dark Arab political sphere, it might help the country stand up to extremist assaults. But if it chooses merely to pay lip service to Tunisia\u2019s achievements, the risk is that the newly elected government may fail. The consequences of this choice are grave.The Obama administration and the United States Congress have an opportunity to amend future historians\u2019 judgments of America\u2019s misguided interventions in the Middle East by coming to the aid of the one success story of the period. And Tunisia\u2019s political achievements are all the more important because they are not the product of American armed intervention. The country\u2019s secular democracy owes much to cultural factors: the peaceful character of its people, their middle-class culture, respect for women\u2019s equality, regard for education, moderate practice of Islam and social tolerance. Unfortunately for the hopes of many at the outset of the Arab Spring, these preconditions for democracy simply did not exist in the rest of the Arab world.In January 2014, just three years after Mohamed Bouazizi immolated himself \u2014 an act that incited the Tunisian revolution, ending 23 years of dictatorship \u2014 the transitional assembly adopted the new Constitution. Islamists held a majority of seats until the elections last fall. But the secular opposition successfully resisted the push of the Islamist party, Ennahda, toward theocracy and Shariah law. Tunisia\u2019s recent presidential elections were universally applauded for their transparency, fairness and civility. In January of this year, President Beji Caid Essebsi pledged to respect and defend the new secular Constitution.The Islamist terrorists who struck weeks later at the Bardo Museum could not accept or even fathom such a bright future. Tunisia\u2019s success as a democracy is incompatible with their perverse, absolutist, almost nihilistic interpretation of Islam. They will not cease until Tunisia declares its allegiance to an archaic form of Islam incompatible with Enlightenment principles \u2014 what my Sorbonne professor, the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur, called the \u201chermeneutics of suspicion,\u201d the interpretive power of critical reason applied to our beliefs and our texts.How can the United States come to Tunisia\u2019s assistance in its hour of need? President Obama\u2019s recent phone call to Mr. Essebsi was appreciated, but words of sympathy are surely far less than the moment requires. To convey a stronger message, America\u2019s president should schedule an early visit to the country, address its newly elected Parliament and let Tunisians know that they are, from now on, among the strategic allies of the United States on the basis of shared democratic values and interests.Congress should, for its part, promptly issue an invitation to Mr. Essebsi to address a joint session of the legislature upon his first official visit to the United States. Congress should also offer a far more significant package of economic, military and financial assistance than the present $61 million appropriation for Tunisia, particularly since the country\u2019s tourism industry, which accounts for about 15 percent of the country\u2019s economy, will certainly be affected by the museum attack.Tunisia only recently emerged from four years of financial mismanagement by the Ennahda-led transitional government. A donor conference, including other major Western countries, would provide the setting for an effective response to Tunisia\u2019s economic needs. Tunisia needs more than symbolic gestures to combat Salafist terrorists determined to cripple the Tunisian economy by frightening off Western tourists and investors. Tunisia\u2019s security sector is also vulnerable and in need of support, including more modern military equipment and intelligence-gathering tools. The government has to contend not only with a 300-mile border with a chaotic, post-Qaddafi Libya (a huge arms bazaar for Islamist terrorists of all stripes), but also with as many as 500 returning Islamic State fighters who must be prevented from launching further attacks like the one at the Bardo Museum. Effective exchange of information between the American intelligence community and the Tunisian security apparatus should be mandated by Congress.Cooperation on security should extend to NATO countries, too. It is clear that Islamic State-inspired jihadists are aiming at Europe no less than at Tunisia, with the Mediterranean region serving as shelter for a new breed of terrorists who can easily disappear among the local populations. It is estimated that about 2,500 susceptible, misinformed Tunisians are fighting in the ranks of the Islamic State. They, too, might one day return and spread havoc. Why wait for another Bardo tragedy to deal with this threat? There is as much at stake for the West in the attack at Tunis last week as there was at Paris in January: It is the same fight.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Tradition of Public Shaming Thrives", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZHUHAI, China \u2014 I got caught cutting class. My teacher was a strapping 30 year old. I was a puny sapling of 14. He gripped my collar and dragged me all the way from our dorm to a classroom, dealing thumps to my head along the way. In a loud voice he denounced me in front of most of my classmates and other teachers.Two days later, my teacher summoned me before an assembly of the whole school to read a 600-word essay of self-criticism that he had made me write. I admitted I was lazy. I said I didn\u2019t respect discipline and had let down my teachers and parents. My classmates appeared amused and my teacher satisfied. For me it was like I had been exposed naked to all.This kind of scene is not uncommon. From primary school to university, I witnessed countless such public humiliations: for fighting, cheating or petty misdemeanors. Caught committing any of these offenses and you may have to stand before the student body, criticizing your own \u201cmoral flaws,\u201d condemning your character defects, showing yourself no mercy, even exaggerating your faults. Only those who have endured it can know the depth of shame one feels.This Chinese tradition has flourished in new forms in the past two years since President Xi Jinping took the helm. The Communist Party under Mr. Xi has made public shaming an exquisite Chinese art, like our fine silk and porcelain. Compared to the brutal rituals of the past, modern televised confessions may appear gentler, more sincere and even inspiring. But their frequency shows that our \u201cpeople\u2019s government\u201d doesn\u2019t actually care much about the people\u2019s personal rights, dignity or privacy.The leading media outlet CCTV has provided a platform for many of the public shamings, which have included those of business people, screenwriters, celebrities, editors and journalists \u2014 anyone deemed to be on the wrong side of the Communist Party\u2019s latest self-serving campaign. They speak to us from behind bars, their prisoner status made clear from their uniforms and (sometimes) shaved heads, their serious expressions and tearful faces. Marshaling the full power of the state, CCTV has influence far beyond most of the world\u2019s TV stations. Its reporters are given access to tightly guarded detention centers where they oblige criminal suspects to talk. An old man might enlighten viewers about his penchant for soliciting prostitutes, or a young girl charged with prostitution might be required to explain how she would meet with clients. At the time of broadcast, these cases usually haven\u2019t come to trial, but the reports already assume their guilt.Nearly all of these public confessions are grist for the mill of some government campaign. In September 2013, when the government was cleaning up what it perceived as a swamp of online criticism and discussion, CCTV broadcast a public expos\u00e9 of the venture capitalist and influential blogger Charles Xue\u2019s arrest for solicitation of prostitutes. Mr. Xue was an investor in the Chinese Internet industry who had more than 12 million followers on the social media network Sina Weibo. And as part of Mr. Xi\u2019s ongoing campaign to keep the media in line, CCTV broadcast the repentant statements of the likes of journalists Chen Yongzhou and Gao Yu and the respected editor Shen Hao. These influential figures appeared before the nation pressured to admit that they had blackmailed companies or to show regret for leaking national secrets. Seventy-year-old Gao Yu, arrested for giving state secrets to foreign media, dressed in prison clothes, said to the camera, \u201cI admit that what I\u2019ve done touched on legal issues and threatened national interests.\u201d She continued: \u201cMy actions were very wrong. I have sincerely learned my lesson, and I admit my guilt.\u201d Her lawyer later said that she had made her televised statement only because the government had threatened her son. As for Charles Xue and others, we have no evidence that similar tactics were used, but considering their predicament after arrest, noncooperation would have called for great courage.Socialist countries tend to emphasize national and collective interest ahead of individual rights and dignity. This has been a constant throughout 66 years of Communist rule in China, but in the past two years the tendency has become increasingly strident. Cases of public shaming show us how in the name of some great cause, individual rights, dignity and privacy can all be sacrificed.Respecting the rights of individual citizens \u2014 even wrongdoers \u2014 is a fundamental principle of a moral society. But to China\u2019s government this means nothing. Even though our country now boasts the second-largest economy in the world, our freedom hasn\u2019t increased much at all, and remains imperiled. We live amid big posters with the slogan \u201cThe China Dream\u201d that ask us to strive for the strengthening and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, but in China the word \u201cnation\u201d is synonymous with the Communist government. For me, if a \u201cstronger\u201d country does not mean a freer one, then this is not a beautiful dream.On April 16 of last year, Mr. Xue, then 61, was released from prison on medical grounds. Within days he reappeared on Weibo and apologized to his family and his millions of followers. Then he pledged to never again post rumors. Instead, he would strive to \u201cspread positive energy,\u201d and to help young people to realize their \u201cChina Dream.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "European Leaders Urge Greece to Accelerate Overhaul Efforts", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 With Greece rapidly running out of money and again teetering on the edge of default, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany stood firm early Friday against pleading by the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and prodded him to speed up efforts to overhaul his country\u2019s gasping economy in return for cash.Mr. Tsipras has exasperated fellow European leaders, who gathered in Brussels on Thursday for a long-planned two-day meeting about energy and foreign affairs, with what they see as repeated failures by his own left-wing and previous Greek governments to deliver on commitments made in return for bailout funds.Separate talks on Greece stretched late into the night. Afterward, French, German and Greek leaders asserted that Greece can get back on track by accelerating the implementation of an agreement reached between Athens and its creditors on Feb. 20.The talks calmed what in recent days had become a poisonous war of words between Greece and its creditors but did not immediately unblock any money for Athens. That will have to await a decision by the Eurogroup, which comprises finance ministers from the 19 countries that use the single currency, the euro. No date has yet been set for these ministers to reconvene.Ms. Merkel, the leader of Europe\u2019s biggest economy and its main decision maker on policy toward Greece, said at a news conference early Friday in Brussels that Mr. Tsipras had promised to submit a list of overhaul measures \u201cquickly because the situation obviously is one where trust is needed urgently.\u201dGreece has had two international bailouts worth 240 billion euros, or $273 billion, since 2010 but is now once again perilously short of cash. On Friday, nearly $2 billion of debts became due for repayment by its nearly bankrupt government.In a terse statement released after more than three hours of late-night talks with the Greek leader, the heads of the European Union\u2019s main decision-making institutions called on Greece to honor the February agreement and stressed the need for it to move \u201cas fast as possible.\u201dGreece needs to present concrete measures \u201cin the next days,\u201d according to a trio of leaders from the European Commission, the European Council and the Eurogroup.Despite appearing to win no concessions and facing criticism from some of his own left-wing supporters for failing to deliver on promises to scrap austerity measures demanded by Germany, Mr. Tsipras put a brave face on the result of the Brussels talks, telling reporters that \u201cwe are more optimist after this deliberation.\u201dFrance\u2019s Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, echoed Ms. Merkel\u2019s tough line, saying that the talks with Mr. Tsipras had focused on \u201cthe necessity of Greece to deliver the reforms that are expected of it.\u201d He ruled out any revision of the February deal, describing it as \u201cthe right process, the right path to find a solution for Greece.\u201dWhile Mr. Tsipras\u2019s party, Syriza, has blamed its travails largely on Germany, other European Union leaders have aligned themselves with Berlin\u2019s demands for prompt action by Greece. Alexander Stubb, the prime minister of Finland, said Greece had \u201cno chance, absolutely\u201d of getting any further money from Europe unless it first delivered on its February promises.In keeping with the European Union\u2019s preference for orderly procedure rather than confronting crises as they happen, Greece\u2019s desperate financial situation did not figure on the official agenda for the two-day gathering of 28 leaders that began Thursday in Brussels. Instead, they focused on long-stalled but recently revived plans to reduce dependency on Russian gas; the conflict in Ukraine; and the spreading chaos in Libya.At the end of the first day of formal discussions, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which represents leaders, said there was agreement that sanctions imposed last year on Russia after the annexation of Crimea last March should remain in force until a cease-fire to the conflict in eastern Ukraine \u2014 agreed to last month in Minsk, Belarus \u2014 had been fully implemented. This, he indicated, meant that Russia could expect no relief from tight restrictions on Western credits and other sanctions until at least the end of the year.These agreements, however, did nothing to tackle what a senior European diplomat described as \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d \u2014 the risk of a Greek default and revived fears about the future of Europe\u2019s common currency.Greece\u2019s backsliding on its pledges has stirred speculation in recent days of a possible \u201cGrexit,\u201d or Greek exit, from the 19-nation group that uses the euro. It also gave rise to a new piece of Brussels jargon: \u201cGrexident,\u201d or the prospect of Greece stumbling through the exit by accident.In a sign of how testy the mood had become, Charles Michel, the prime minister of Belgium, another country that uses the euro, complained that mediation with Greece should involve all members of the eurozone and could not be done by a few individual members.\u201cI am angry,\u201d Mr. Michel said, according to Belgian news reports. \u201cWe did not give a mandate to either France or Germany to negotiate.\u201dBut Mr. Stubb of Finland, which also uses the euro, said he was happy to let Ms. Merkel and Mr. Hollande face down Mr. Tsipras late into the night, noting that \u201cthere is always a lot of mayhem around these meetings.\u201dA Greek departure from the eurozone could force it to leave the European Union, too, a step that would, for the first time, throw into reverse a process of integration that has advanced steadily for more than six decades.It would also raise doubts about the future integrity and viability of Europe\u2019s most significant joint venture, its common currency.\u201cThe eurozone is more than a fixed-rate system, it\u2019s more than that,\u201d Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said at a news conference in Brussels on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a single currency, and the single currency has to be perpetual for all its members, and as soon as one leaves, the question is, who\u2019s next? And that\u2019s not the way things must go.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As U.S. and Iran Seek Nuclear Deal, Saudi Arabia Makes Its Own Moves", "Date": "2015-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 As America talks to Iran, Saudi Arabia is lashing out against it.The kingdom, Iran\u2019s chief regional rival, is leading airstrikes against an Iranian-backed faction in Yemen; backing a blitz in Idlib, Syria, by jihadists fighting the Iranian-backed Assad regime; and warning Washington not to allow the Iranian-backed militia to capture too much of Iraq during the fight to roll back the Islamic State, according to Arab diplomats familiar with the talks.Through Egypt, a major beneficiary of Saudi aid, the kingdom is backing plans for a combined Arab military force to combat Iranian influence around the region. With another major aid recipient, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia is also expected to step up its efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, potentially setting off an arms race in the region.\u201cTaking matters into our own hands is the name of the game today,\u201d said Jamal Khashoggi, a veteran Saudi journalist and former adviser to the government. \u201cA deal will open up the Saudi appetite and the Turkish appetite for more nuclear programs. But for the time being Saudi Arabia is moving ahead with its operations to pull the carpet out from underneath the Iranians in our region.\u201dWith the approach of a self-imposed Tuesday night deadline for the framework of a nuclear deal between Iran and the Western powers, the talks themselves are already changing the dynamics of regional politics.The proposed deal would trade relief from economic sanctions on Iran for insurance against the risk that Iran might rapidly develop a nuclear bomb. But many Arab analysts and diplomats say that security against the nuclear risk may come at the cost of worsening ongoing conflicts around the Middle East as Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Muslim allies push back against what they see as efforts by Shiite-led Iran to impose its influence \u2014 often on sectarian battle lines.Unless Iran pulls back, \u201cyou will see more direct Arab responses and you will see a higher level of geopolitical tension in the whole region,\u201d argued Nabil Fahmy, a veteran Egyptian diplomat and former foreign minister.As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start.In Yemen, where a bombing campaign by a Saudi-led coalition killed dozens of civilians in an errant strike on a camp for displaced families, the Saudis accuse Iran of supporting the Houthi movement, which follows a form of Shiite Islam and recently came close to taking control of the country\u2019s four largest cities. (Western diplomats say Iran has provided money to the group but does not control it.) In Bahrain, across a short causeway from Saudi Arabia, the kingdom and its allies accuse Iran of backing opposition from the Shiite majority against the Sunni monarchy.And Iran has also cultivated clients in government in the great Arab capitals of Damascus, Baghdad and Beirut, the last through its proxy, Hezbollah.Even if the proposed deal constrains Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, the Saudis and their allies note, the pact would do nothing to stop Iran from projecting its influence through such local proxies and conventional arms. Sanctions relief from the deal could even revive the Iranian economy with a flood of new oil revenues.\u201cThe Americans seem nonchalant about this, like, \u2018This is your sectarian problem, you deal with it,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Khashoggi said. \u201cSo the Saudis went ahead with this Yemen operation.\u201dA look at where Iran exerts influence across the region and at the emerging Saudi coalition.Watching Secretary of State John Kerry pursue a deal in Lausanne, Switzerland, many in Saudi Arabia and other Arab states say their ultimate fear is that the talks could lead to a broader d\u00e9tente or even alliance between Washington and Tehran.Washington is already tacitly coordinating with Iran in its fight against ISIS in Iraq. As a result, the American-led military campaign is effectively strengthening the Iranian-backed government in Syria by weakening its most dangerous foe, Arab diplomats and analysts say.Easing the hostility between the United States and Iran would tear up what has been a bedrock principle of regional politics since the Iranian revolution and the storming of the American embassy in 1979. \u201cBut let\u2019s not forget that we are still dealing with the Islamic Republic of Iran,\u201d Mr. Shaikh said, reflecting the skeptical views of many in the Saudi Arabian camp.What the United States and Iran want out of discussions over Iran\u2019s nuclear development.\u201cThere is a disbelief in the Arab world that these negotiations are only about the nuclear file, and a frequent complaint here is that we are kept in the dark, we are not consulted,\u201d said Gamal Abdel Gawad Soltan, a political scientist at the American University in Cairo. \u201cThe U.S. is much less trusted as an ally, as an insurance policy towards the security threats facing the governments in the region, and so those governments decide to act on their own.\u201dPresident Obama has argued that a verifiable deal is the best way to secure the Arab states because it is the most effective way to ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear bomb. Even military action to take out Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, the Obama administration argues, would set it back only temporarily.But she acknowledged that at the moment Saudi Arabia and its allies did not see it that way. \u201cThe Saudi and Iranian rivalry is being played out now in a hot war in Iraq, in Syria and now in Yemen,\u201d she said. \u201cThe confrontation is causing people on both sides to dig into their sectarian positions.\u201dAversion to the Iran deal in the Saudi camp is also representative of the latest convergence of views with the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been deeply critical of the nuclear pact. But \u201cthey can be on the same side without necessarily talking,\u201d said Mr. Soltan of the American University in Cairo.Whether an Iran deal is consummated or not, he and several other analysts said, the negotiations have contributed to a divergence with the Obama administration and a growing desire for greater autonomy among the Sunni Arab states.Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies bucked the Obama administration to sponsor the military takeover and repression of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in 2013, for example. And last year the United Arab Emirates carried out airstrikes from Egyptian bases against Islamist allied militias in Tripoli, Libya, without notifying Washington. Some American diplomats were so incredulous that the U.A.E. acted on its own that they doubted early reports until a second set of strikes confirmed them.\u201cThere are issues that you cannot expect a superpower to engage in directly because of their own politics and interests, and if you don\u2019t have the capabilities or the initiatives to deal with them yourself then you are not providing enough of a deterrent to other regional players,\u201d said Mr. Fahmy, the former Egyptian foreign minister. He added, speaking of Arab relations with Washington, \u201cThere is a difference between a security relationship and a security addiction.\u201dAnnotated maps showing the Houthi rebels\u2019 drive south, U.S. airstrikes and historical divisions.Mr. Khashoggi, the Saudi editor, argued that Saudi Arabia\u2019s own campaign to push back against Iran without waiting for the Americans was showing signs of success. Saudi Arabian and Turkish sponsors, he said, had backed the coalition of jihadist groups that recently captured the Syrian city of Idlib in the first major victory in months against the government of President Bashar al-Assad.One participant in the coalition was the Nusra Front, the Syrian arm of Al Qaeda, a terrorist group in the eyes of the West. But members of the jihadi coalition \u201care the ones who captured Idlib, it is an important development, and I think we are going to see more of that,\u201d Mr. Khashoggi said. \u201cCoordination between Turkish and Saudi intelligence has never been as good as now.\u201dThe after-the-fact American support for the military campaign in Yemen, he said, was also a reassuring sign that Washington was willing to back Saudi leadership as it pushes back against Iran across the region. \u201cThe Americans are going along with that,\u201d he said.The operation \u201cproved that a regional power can lead, they do not have to wait for America,\u201d he said, \u201cand if the issue is moral or justified, America will get on board.\u201dAn article on March 31 about aggressive moves by Saudi Arabia that coincided with talks between the United States and Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s chief regional rival, over the Iranian nuclear program misstated the age of Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the Saudi defense minister and son of the new king. Saudi Arabia has not officially disclosed his age, and some of his supporters have sought to overstate his age. But Saudi officials and members of the royal family, speaking on the condition of anonymity, say the prince was born in 1985, making him 29 or 30 years old, not 34.

{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Elite Still Enjoying a Tax Break 100 Years Old", "Date": "2015-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 They are among the British moneyed elite: the head of the nation\u2019s largest bank, a billionaire hedge fund manager and the owner of some of London\u2019s most luxurious nightclubs.Yet for tax purposes, they are not entirely British.Thanks to a law from when Britain had an empire, a growing number of the rich and internationally mobile here do not have to pay tax on their foreign income or assets, only on the money they earn in Britain. They are the \u201cnon-domiciled,\u201d or non-doms.To qualify for that status, they simply need to show that their fathers were born outside Britain and that they intend to someday return to that place. Alternatively, they can choose a new permanent home \u2014 Hong Kong with its low tax rate is popular \u2014 return to Britain and demonstrate their intention to go back to their new permanent home by, for example, buying a grave plot there or drawing up a local will.This Edwardian-era tax arrangement has returned to center stage. Questions are being raised as recent revelations that HSBC\u2019s private bank in Switzerland helped clients stash money in offshore accounts reinforce a view that the wealthy play by a different set of rules when it comes to taxes.\u201cWe have a large number of very wealthy people who are using the U.K. as a tax haven,\u201d said Richard Murphy, a chartered accountant and director of Tax Research UK. \u201cThere are more non-dom people in the U.K. than there are people living in offshore tax havens like Jersey.\u201dThe number of people with non-dom status in Britain surged to nearly 130,000 in 2008, a 22 percent increase from 2000, after the government introduced an annual tax of 30,000 pounds, or about $46,000, a year on anyone who lives in Britain more than seven years. After several years of decline, the number of non-doms is again increasing.That has ruffled many in Britain, where non-doms have figured in a national debate over inequality, government austerity and asset bubbles. In London, a flood of foreign money is widely believed to have driven up housing prices and made the city unaffordable for middle-class professionals.Defenders of the tax policy say that Britain benefits because it encourages wealthy people who have choices about where to settle and spend their money to choose Britain over tax havens such as Switzerland and Dubai.\u201cIt has encouraged rich people to come and live in the U.K. and bring money and spend it here for the general good of our economy,\u201d said Patrick Stevens, tax policy director at the Chartered Institute of Taxation, a British professional body and nonprofit organization.Most countries use physical presence, or residence, to determine liability for taxes. And many allow foreigners to live and work for a short number of years, paying tax only on the money they make domestically. In the United States, citizens must pay taxes on their money wherever it may be, and foreigners living in the United States are subject to the same rules.And then there are those who own homes and educate their children here, but claim non-dom status from the good fortune of having a father who was born in say, South Africa or India.\u201cThe system is no longer fit for purpose,\u201d said one lawyer who did not want to alienate his clients by speaking on the record. \u201cA lot of people claim it who have been here a long time and whose links with other countries are pretty weak,\u201d he said.The origin of the status is rooted in the vestiges of Britain\u2019s empire. In 1914, the chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, introduced a budget that would tax wealth anywhere in the world \u2014 similar to the system in America today. But an exemption was passed for those in the far-flung reaches of the empire whose wealth might be subject to local taxes. Citizens of Britain, they were \u201cdomiciled\u201d elsewhere. Now, they are here, with future plans to settle elsewhere.Details about some prominent British non-doms have emerged in the HSBC files that were leaked recently. They include Stuart T. Gulliver, chief executive of HSBC, and Richard Caring, who lives in a house that has been called the Versailles of Hampstead \u2014 one of London\u2019s fanciest neighborhoods \u2014 and owns nightclubs in London like Soho House and Annabel\u2019s.Mr. Gulliver, who was born in Britain and runs Britain\u2019s biggest bank, became a non-dom as a result of his long tenure in Hong Kong and his stated intention to return there to die. Mr. Caring is a non-dom because his father was an American G.I. who settled in London after World War II.Chris Hohn, the billionaire hedge fund manager and another prominent non-dom, built his business in Britain and his family lives here, but he is a non-dom because his father was born in Jamaica.A representative for Mr. Hohn did not respond to a request for comment; Mr. Caring declined to comment through a spokesman, although he has said if there is a problem with his being a non-dom, the law should be changed.Non-doms pay tax on income generated in Britain, as well as any money brought into Britain. This totaled \u00a36.8 billion, including the fees from the levies, in 2011-12, the most recent year for which data is available, according to the law firm Pinsent Masons.But some non-doms have \u201cdual contracts\u201d that designate a portion of their salary or bonus to be earned abroad at significantly lower tax rates.Starting in April, the government tax for those staying more than 12 years will go up to \u00a360,000 a year and \u00a390,000 for those staying longer than 17 years. Non-doms lose the inheritance tax benefit after 17 years unless they set up an offshore trust before the 17-year deadline \u2014 which most do, say tax lawyers.Arguments for more restrictions \u2014 or a complete overhaul \u2014 have gained strength on the back of the HSBC leaks, provided by a whistle-blower to French authorities and passed to governments in 2010. The government has imposed some measures that raise more money from non-doms, including fees on those owning property via offshore companies, a popular strategy for the group, tax lawyers say.But proponents say that if the exemption is taken away, the mobile elite and their deep pockets will leave and Britain will suffer.\u201cSo much is now tied up in our economy with non-doms that it would be a brave chancellor that decided we don\u2019t need the business anymore,\u201d said Jason Collins, head of tax at Pinsent Masons.These residents do more than just spend, proponents say. They build businesses here that employ people who pay taxes and they pay taxes on the money they make here or bring into Britain.Some question the assumptions underlying those arguments. London has rich culture and world-class schools, suggesting that perhaps it does not need to offer tax benefits, too. And many challenge the view that luxury spending actually does trickle down.\u201cIf anything, the linkages between non-doms and the real U.K. economy are very weak precisely because they hold their assets offshore, beyond U.K. taxation, and hence the leakages of revenue outside the U.K. are very high,\u201d said John Christensen, founder of the Tax Justice network and a former economic adviser to Jersey.The issue of lost revenue irks some. At a recent hearing, the head of Britain\u2019s tax authority, Lin Homer, was grilled on her agency\u2019s performance chasing HSBC clients accused of tax evasion.Why had France and Spain collected more money from fewer individuals?\u201cI can only collect the tax that is due,\u201d Ms. Homer said.\u201cYou mean because of non-doms?\u201d asked an enraged member of Parliament.It was one reason, she conceded.Advertisement"}

She had taught courses at New York University and at the Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference at Middlebury College but was finding it difficult to maintain a consistent class schedule while fulfilling her obligations as a staff writer for The New Yorker. \u201cI just started thinking, well, maybe there\u2019s a different way to do this that doesn\u2019t tie me to a physical location,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd right around that time, Skillshare contacted me.\u201d The company\u2019s business model does not depend solely on experts. Instead, those behind the service are banking on the idea that amateurs will be inspired to share their knowledge online. They envision the website as a kind of educational YouTube: If you want to teach anyone anything \u2014 how to use Photoshop, or even how to chug a beer more efficiently \u2014 Skillshare wants to host your classes. Many users find that appealing. Since the platform was opened last September, the number of courses offered has nearly doubled to about 1,000. Skillshare has raised more than $10 million in venture capital.Students pay $10 a month for unlimited access to Skillshare courses, and 850,000 are signed up, the company says. Frequently, thousands will sign up for a single course. Jake Bartlett, a freelance motion-graphics artist who teaches digital visual effects, says about 1,200 students signed up for his latest course. Nearly 2,000 students are enrolled in Ms. Millman\u2019s visual storytelling class, her first on the site.Teachers with at least 25 students can enter a \u201cpartner program\u201d in which they are paid based on the number of subscribing students in their classes, and for projects those students submit. Skillshare says that on average, teachers in the program are paid $3,500 annually. Those with fewer than 25 students are not paid.Skillshare, which is based in New York, was developed in 2011 as an offline enterprise, a form of alternative education that would teach practical skills to students in local communities. But the legwork involved was taxing, so in the summer of 2012 the company moved online. Last fall, it opened to anybody who wanted to teach a course. The company\u2019s chief executive, Michael Karnjanaprakorn, said that opening the platform was essential in addressing how teaching and learning work online.\u201cThe Internet is like this virtual town getting built,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s say The New York Times is the newspaper, Twitter is a short form of communication, Facebook is a town center and AOL built the roads. What we think is getting built right now is the hospital and the school. And in order for those things to be built, they have to keep in mind how the Internet works.\u201dHe said building the Internet\u2019s school meant letting users determine the courses they want to teach and take without creating many financial obstacles. The way Skillshare accommodates its students academically and financially sets it apart from its online competitors. Companies like Coursera and Udacity prepare students for the work force in a more familiar fashion. For the most part, Coursera hews closely to traditional college courses, and Udacity offers \u201cnanodegrees\u201d for digital skills that will appeal to prospective employers in the technology sector. Even Udemy, an online education platform that is also open to anyone who wants to teach, allows instructors to set prices, which can make enrollment in multiple courses difficult for students on a budget.Most of the subjects that Skillshare offers resemble the abilities someone might pick up after spending a couple of semesters in the company of art school students. Colleen Sullivan Leh, 46, a graphic designer in Lake Orion, Mich., has subscribed to Skillshare for about a year and has taken classes on typography and photography. She said she liked being able to set her own pace without being evaluated.\u201cIt works for me because there are no grades involved,\u201d she said.Because it does not field more traditional classes or award grades or credentials, Skillshare is vulnerable to criticism that it masquerades as a learning platform while it wastes users\u2019 time and money. But those who have taken issue with other forms of \u201cedutainment\u201d are more accepting of a platform that teaches practical skills. Nathan Jurgenson, a graduate student in sociology at the University of Maryland and a specialist in Internet culture, sees Skillshare as a \u201cstopgap measure,\u201d necessary to an economy in which skills can be more valuable than diplomas. \u201cIt\u2019s far more suited to our economy than going to a graduate program,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat Skillshare is doing is more in line with what our precarious work force needs.\u201dMany instructors, including Ms. Millman and Ms. Orlean, emphasized that Skillshare was not a replacement for traditional education, but more of a complementary way to learn.\u201cThe in-class dynamic is something that is very important to me, so I\u2019ve been very reluctant to get on the online teaching bandwagon,\u201d Ms. Millman said.But Ms. Orlean found that in at least one way, teaching at Skillshare was more positive than that in traditional academia.\u201cI always had good students, but I also think they\u2019re there to fulfill their credit requirements so there\u2019s a little element of obligation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhereas people who are signing on for Skillshare really want to do it. And they don\u2019t get anything for it except learning.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New Jobs Report Shows Janet Yellen\u2019s Quandary in a Nutshell", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyThe biggest decision that Janet Yellen has faced in her year-old Federal Reserve chairmanship was laid bare in a single report on the domestic job market released Friday.For a Fed that has spent the last seven years doing everything it can think of to try to get the job market on track, that translates to: Mission Accomplished. And by traditional central bank thinking, that would mean it\u2019s waited long enough to raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating.But by other measures in the same report, overheating is a distant worry. Average hourly earnings rose only 0.1 percent, and have now risen less than 2 percent over the last year \u2014 pretty much what they\u2019ve been doing for five years straight. The number of people in the labor force actually declined, suggesting that the pool of potential workers who neither have a job nor are looking for one is growing, not shrinking.All of that points to a job market that still has a great deal of room to run before the Yellen Fed needs to do much of anything.For a Federal Reserve chairwoman who largely spent her first year implementing policies that had been agreed upon before she took office, this is a major decision point. Which set of signals should she and her colleagues on the Fed\u2019s policy-setting board listen to?The battle of conflicting economic ideas was played out in the financial markets Friday. Reaction there was at odds with the reaction of some of the sharper Fed analysts to the new data. Longer-term interest rates soared Friday morning upon the release of the new data, as did the dollar, indicating that bond and currency traders saw the report as implying the Fed will raise interest rates sooner and higher than it had seemed just before the release.Based on futures market prices, for example, investors on Thursday had seen a 49 percent chance of a Fed interest rate increase by September. It rose to 59 percent Friday after the new data. That is a clear signal that Wall Street is doing some simple math to conclude that More Jobs + Lower Unemployment = Tighter Monetary Policy.Some Fed watchers aren\u2019t so sure that adds up. \u201cUntil we see gains in higher-wage jobs (and the trend has been flat for quite a long time), we won\u2019t see upward pressure on wages, and we won\u2019t see upward pressure on inflation,\u201d Megan Greene, the chief economist of John Hancock Financial Services, said in a note to clients. \u201cI hope this would impact the timing of the Fed\u2019s next rate hike. Today\u2019s report supports the argument that the Fed should wait until at least the end of this year to start hiking rates.\u201d\u201cThe softness in average hourly earnings tempers the case for a June rate hike,\u201d wrote Krishna Guha of Evercore ISI. \u201cWe view this as a close call but still lean to September.\u201dAt the same time, it is the job of Fed officials to make policy based on where the economy is going, not where it has been. The interest rate decisions they make now have their greatest effect many months down the road.If you went back in time and told Janet Yellen, college professor, circa 2005, that the unemployment rate was 5.5 percent and the economy was adding 300,000 jobs a month, her reaction would probably be simple: It\u2019s time to raise interest rates. Excessive inflation will surely result if you don\u2019t.But so much has changed in the last decade. The economy has been so deep in the doldrums for so long, the deflationary forces pulling down prices globally so strong. The Fed has done so much to try to get the job market revving again. Ms. Yellen will be wary of quashing the recovery. Why? The expansion\u2019s ability to translate into higher pay for ordinary Americans is not yet established.That\u2019s why she was coy in congressional testimony last week when asked whether the Fed would need to see clear proof of rising wages before raising rates.\u201cThere are perhaps hints, but we\u2019ve not seen any significant pickup in wage growth,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cBut there are a number of different factors that affect the inflation outlook, and we will be considering carefully a range of evidence.\u201dBut assuming the next few months of data unfold the way they have been, with strong job growth, falling unemployment and continued disappointments on wages, she and her colleagues face a big decision that will shape how history views both Ms. Yellen and her leadership of the Fed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Orders Cuts in Federal Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "Date": "2015-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Obama\u2019s directive orders federal agencies over the next decade to cut their emissions by an average of 40 percent compared with their levels when he won office in 2008, and to increase their use of electricity from renewable sources by 30 percent.They are also part of Mr. Obama\u2019s effort during his last two years in office to use an expansive interpretation of his presidential authority to push ahead with unilateral moves to combat climate change in the face of strong opposition from the Republican-controlled Congress to advancing legislation that would do so.\u201cWe\u2019re proving that it is possible to grow our economy robustly while at the same time doing the right thing for our environment and tackling climate change in a serious way,\u201d Mr. Obama said during a visit to the Energy Department on Thursday to announce the order. \u201cAmerica once again is going to be leading by example.\u201dThe federal government\u2019s share of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States is minuscule \u2014 less than 1 percent in 2013, the last year for which data is available \u2014 so the order by itself is unlikely to make a major dent in the president\u2019s broader goals to cut emissions.But because the federal government is the largest user of energy in the United States economy \u2014 encompassing 360,000 buildings, 650,000 fleet vehicles and $445 billion in annual spending on goods and services \u2014 it has the potential to influence private companies to step up their emissions-cutting targets.In conjunction with the executive order, the Obama administration released a new scorecard to allow federal suppliers to disclose their emissions and track their reductions. Several large companies that do business with the federal government \u2014 including I.B.M., General Electric, Honeywell and Northrop Grumman \u2014 announced new emissions-cutting goals of their own.\u201cAs we get economies of scale, and demand for solar and wind and other renewable energies grows, obviously that can help drive down the overall price, make it that much for efficient, and we start getting a virtuous cycle that is good for the economy and creates jobs here in America,\u201d Mr. Obama said after touring the Energy Department\u2019s solar-paneled rooftop.At a round table with representatives of some of the private corporations taking part, Mr. Obama praised the companies for stepping up with new or enhanced emissions-cutting targets.\u201cYou guys have done an outstanding job,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of the prominence of many of the companies here, and the fact that they\u2019ve got a whole bunch of suppliers up and down the chain, what you do with respect to energy efficiency is going to have a ripple effect throughout the economy.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s directive extends a goal he set during his first year in office, when he signed an executive order to cut federal greenhouse gas emissions by 28 percent by 2020.Since then, said Christy Goldfuss, the managing director at the White House Council on Environmental Quality, federal agencies have reduced their emissions by 17 percent, and increased, to 9 percent from 3 percent, the share of electricity they consume from renewable sources.White House officials, who are increasingly describing Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental agenda in economic terms, estimated that the directive issued on Thursday could save up to $18 billion over the next decade by cutting down on wasted energy.\u201cFor federal agencies who are looking at how to cover their energy needs, this is a very pragmatic dollars-and-cents issue,\u201d said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cIf they can consume less energy or they can consume renewable energy that is cheaper, more reliable or more sustainable, then they can achieve their environmental goals while they are saving money.\u201dMr. Obama has also laid out an ambitious overall emissions-cutting goal for the United States ahead of a United Nations climate conference in December in Paris, and is expected by the end of the month to release his detailed plan for reaching those targets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three States and Two Tribes to Get $27 Million to Fight Childhood Hunger ", "Date": "2015-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration, as part of a broader push to address persistent poverty and childhood hunger in rural areas, said Tuesday that it would provide millions of dollars in grants to help several economically distressed communities.Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, said three states and two tribal governments would get more than $27 million to fund demonstration projects to provide food to children and their families, including projects that would provide home delivery of food or meals to children on weekends.The projects will be tested in Kentucky, Nevada and Virginia, as well as in the Chickasaw and Navajo tribal nations.\u201cThese projects are a continuation of the administration\u2019s efforts to help people get back to work and earn enough to take care of their families, and reach kids in high-poverty rural areas,\u201d Mr. Vilsack said in an interview.Despite an uptick in the economy in recent years, rural areas continue to lag behind, and children are hit especially hard. Approximately 6.1 million children live in poverty in rural areas, and 90 percent of counties with the highest level of child poverty are in rural areas, census data shows. Nearly 40 percent of Native American children live in poverty, the data shows.Rex Lee Jim, vice president of the Navajo Nation, said his government would get about $2.4 million in grants. Among other things, he said, it will pay about 12 people to travel around the Navajo reservation in New Mexico to educate families about government-provided food benefits.\u201cThere are a lot of government programs like food stamps and free and reduced meals that people on the reservation may be eligible for,\u201d Mr. Jim said, \u201cbut many of our people aren\u2019t aware of these programs.\u201dA $3.6 million grant for Kentucky focuses on counties in the state\u2019s southeastern coal mining region. It will be used to test the impact of allowing households with children under 16 to deduct from their income the cost of traveling to the grocery store so they could qualify for more food stamp benefits, state officials said. Families that qualify could get an increase of about $50 a month in food stamps.\u201cWe believe that with additional dollars we will see more frequent trips to the grocery store,\u201d said Audrey Haynes, secretary of the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services.The projects are just part of the Agriculture Department efforts to focus on poverty and hunger among children, particularly in rural areas, Mr. Vilsack said.The Agriculture Department will soon announce plans to expand its summer meals program for children, provide funding to schools to buy equipment to prepare healthier meals, and expand job training and employment programs.The Agriculture Department\u2019s push to address childhood hunger came as the Republican-led House announced plans to roll back new school meal regulations, and considers revisions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to reduce the number of people receiving food stamp benefits.Mr. Vilsack said the efforts in Congress could undercut the gains made in reducing childhood hunger and poverty.\u201cThis new study adds to a growing body of scientific research that shows these standards are working,\u201d Mr. Vilsack said. \u201cFor Congress to meddle with doctors\u2019 recommendations and go back to less healthy meals now would not be in the best interest of our children.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Lowers Official Economic Growth Target", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China on Thursday lowered its economic growth target for this year to \u201capproxmately 7 percent,\u201d a significant if widely anticipated development that signals the Communist Party\u2019s determination to shift to more sustainable development.In an annual report to the National People\u2019s Congress, the Party-controlled legislature, Prime Minister Li Keqiang set a target for gross domestic product to rise by around 7 percent this year. That is down from a target of around 7.5 percent that the government set for 2014, which it missed by a whisker. Last year\u2019s actual expansion of 7.4 percent was the country\u2019s slowest since 1990.Under President Xi Jinping, who came to power in late 2012, the Chinese leadership has been trying to reduce the country\u2019s reliance on credit-fuelled investment\u2014a growth model that elevated China to the world\u2019s second biggest economy, after the United States, but one that led to a host of problems including soaring government and corporate debt levels, a property market bubble, wasteful investments and environmental degradation.In their push to shift the economic model to one more reliant on market forces like consumer demand, China\u2019s leaders have repeatedly signaled this will mean a slower topline growth rate for the economy. In his report on Thursday, Mr. Li reiterated this stance.\u201cChina\u2019s economic development has entered a new normal,\u201d Mr. Li said, a nod to one of the key slogans of Mr. Xi\u2019s political agenda. \u201cSystemic, institutional and structural problems have become \u2018tigers in the road\u2019 holding up development. Without deepening reform and making economic structural adjustments, we will have a difficult time sustaining steady and sound development.\u201dChina last lowered its annual G.D.P. target in 2012, reducing it to 7.5 percent, down from the 8 percent level where it had been fixed since 2005. Before 2014, the last time China missed a growth target was 1998, in the wake of the Asian currency crisis, when G.D.P. came in at 7.8 percent against a target of 8 percent.In his report, Mr. Li also set a consumer price inflation target of 3 percent, down from last year\u2019s 3.5 percent target\u2014a nod to notable disinflationary forces at work in the economy, where consumer price inflation hit a five-year low in January.\u201cStepping down G.D.P. targets to 7 percent demonstrates the reality of China\u2019s potential current growth, and the reality that the Xi leadership is dealing with the problems that come with reform rather than the problems that come with deferring reform through further monetary permissiveness,\u201d said Daniel H. Rosen, founding partner of the Rhodium Group, an economic research and advisory firm.By shifting to a softer growth target of \u201caround\u201d a certain percent, the government is also signaling its intent to focus more on the composition of economic growth rather than its absolute pace. But doing away with targets altogether would be a step too far for China at the moment.Setting a softer growth goal represents \u201ca helpful step away from the tradition of specifying a target,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. \u201cFor now, however, too many aspects of China\u2019s fiscal system still rely on this annual touchstone to abolish it altogether,\u201d he added.Patrick Zuo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Temptation of Hillary", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHillary Clinton\u2019s record is more moderate than the Democratic primary voter today. So it was always likely that she would move left as the primary season approached. It\u2019s now becoming clearer how she might do it. She might make a shift from what you might call human capital progressivism to redistributionist progressivism. The real problem, some of them say, is concentrated political power. The oligarchs have rigged the game so that workers get squeezed. Others say the problem is stagnation. It\u2019s not that workers don\u2019t have skills; the private economy isn\u2019t generating jobs. Or it\u2019s about corporate power. Without stronger unions shareholders reap all the gains. People in this camp point out that inflation-adjusted wages for college grads have been flat for the past 14 years. Education apparently hasn\u2019t lifted wages. The implication? Don\u2019t focus on education for the bottom 99 percent. Focus on spreading wealth from the top. Don\u2019t put human capital first. Put redistribution first.Over the past few months a stream of Democratic thinkers and politicians, including natural Clinton allies, have moved from the human capital emphasis to the redistributionist emphasis. (It\u2019s a matter of emphasis, not strictly either/or.) For Clinton herself, the appeal is obvious. The redistributionist agenda allows her to hit Wall Street and C.E.O.\u2019s \u2014 all the targets that have become progressive b\u00eates noires. Unfortunately, this rising theory is wrong on substance and damaging in its effects.It is true that wages for college grads have been flat this century, and that is troubling. But this is not true of people with post-college degrees, who are doing nicely. Moreover, as Lawrence Katz of Harvard points out, the argument that college doesn\u2019t pay is partly a product of a short-time horizon. Since 2000, the real incomes of the top 1 percent have declined slightly. If you limited your view to just those years, you\u2019d conclude that there is no inequality problem, which is clearly not true. \u201cWhat I find destructive,\u201d says David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, \u201cis the message that if you don\u2019t get into the top 1 percent then you\u2019re out of the game. That\u2019s deeply, deeply incorrect.\u201dAutor\u2019s own research shows that skills differences are four times more important than concentration of wealth in driving inequality. If we could magically confiscate and redistribute the above-average income gains that have gone to the top 1 percent since 1979, that would produce $7,000 more per household per year for the bottom 99 percent. But if we could close the gap so that high-school-educated people had the skills of college-educated people, that would increase household income by $28,000 per year.Focusing on human capital is not whistling past the graveyard. Worker productivity is the main arena. No redistributionist measure will have the same long-term effect as good early-childhood education and better community colleges, or increasing the share of men capable of joining the labor force. The redistributionists seem to believe that modern capitalism is fundamentally broken. That growth has permanently stagnated. That productivity should no longer be the focus because it doesn\u2019t lead to shared prosperity.But their view is biased by temporary evidence from the recession. Right now, jobs are being created, wages are showing signs of life. Those who get more skills earn more money. Today\u2019s economy has challenges, but the traditional rules still apply. Increasing worker productivity is the key. Increasing incentives to risk and invest is essential. Shifting people into low-productivity government jobs is not the answer.It\u2019s clear why Clinton might want to talk redistribution. On substantive policy grounds, it would be destructive to do so. And, in the general election, voters respond to the uplifting and the unifying, not the combative and divisive. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beijing\u2019s Fear of Technology", "Date": "2015-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBEIJING \u2014 Since China opened to the West three-and-a-half decades ago, foreigners, foreign companies, and foreign technology have oftentimes been suspect in the eyes of some government factions. Chinese reformers have had an uphill battle in overcoming these deeply rooted cultural fears.The authorities\u2019 paranoia is at the heart of the 1985 Chinese film \u201cThe Black Cannon Incident.\u201d In the picture, the lead character, Zhao Shuxin, is a capable and competent German-speaking engineer in a state-owned mining company that seeks to obtain West German technology. Mr. Zhao is an avid player of Chinese chess and when he finds one of his chess pieces missing \u2014 the black cannon \u2014 he sends a telegram to a hotel that he previously stayed at requesting the hotel\u2019s help in finding it: \u201cMissing black cannon. 301. Search for Zhao.\u201dThe ambiguously worded telegram arouses the interest of security authorities and the police detain Mr. Zhao, believing he is spying for foreigners and involved in an illicit arms deal. The chess piece is finally found and Mr. Zhao is cleared, but the factory Communist Party chief chastises him for sending the telegram anyway. \u201cThe Black Cannon Incident\u201d reflects how innocuous communications can be misinterpreted as something sinister and as a threat to national security \u2014 and it\u2019s also a not-so-subtle attack on the overreaching and paranoia of the authorities. The reformers in the government in 1985 allowed this political satire to be shown in limited release to send the nation a message that people should be more trusting of foreigners to encourage foreign direct investment and the introduction of new technology.Fast forward to 2015 and there is a worrying trend involving a series of policy initiatives that could restrict the flow of foreign goods and services in the information communications technology sector.Such restrictive policies could put the country and its companies at a significant disadvantage in the global marketplace. Indeed, one unfortunate consequence of overbroad antiterrorism and national security policies would be to isolate China technologically from the rest of the world, and the end result of that could be to limit the country\u2019s access to cutting-edge technology and innovation.For example, the proposed antiterrorism law \u2014 which is under consideration at the National People\u2019s Congress currently meeting in Beijing \u2014 contains requirements for any information communications technology suppliers in the China market to provide in-country data storage and to alter or modify their products or services to assist in the \u201ccounterterrorism\u201d work of the authorities. Under the law, telecom and Internet operators will be required to install intercept support and decryption capabilities in their systems prior to the use or sale in the Chinese market. China also adopted new banking guidelines in December that outline security criteria for technology products to be considered \u201csecure and controllable\u201d for use in the financial sector. To attain such certification, source codes in operating systems and database software produced abroad or domestically must be registered with the government. The submission of source codes and other information creates significant intellectual property risks for information-tech companies. The China Banking Regulatory Commission provided notice to banks to submit compliance plans by March 15.Similarly, in recent months, as the government tries to get control over the dissemination of information, there has been an uptick in the blocking of foreign websites, a noticeable slowdown in Internet speed and a denial of virtual private network services. A recent business climate survey conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce China found that 83 percent of its member companies were negatively affected by Internet censorship by the Chinese government.At a minimum, the proposed antiterrorism law and the banking rules will create additional intrusive regulatory challenges for information-tech providers and their customers. The unfortunate result of excessive control over email and Internet traffic is the slowing down of commerce. Rather than creating restrictive security policies, the Chinese government should take a more rational approach to security issues and give equal attention to the healthy development and global integration of China\u2019s information-tech sector. This is especially important as Beijing struggles to maintain economic growth levels and rebalance the economy.Yet 30 years after the release of \u201cThe Black Cannon Incident\u201d we are still living in a time in which trust appears to be in question, foreign technology is deemed to be suspect, and paranoia over security interests prevails.Advertisement"}

But in February, car sales were down 38 percent across the board compared with a year earlier.\u201cThis change in our business model in Russia is part of our global strategy to ensure long-term sustainability in markets where we operate,\u201d Mr. Ammann added.Largely exiting Russia as it goes into recession even as the rest of Europe is projected to eke out some growth will help the automaker return its overall European division to profitability by next year, the company said.No signs of wide-scale regulatory pressure, though, have emerged. Instead, the Russian economy has simply slowed because of falling oil prices and sanctions, so that Russian consumers are no longer such a coveted group.Russians\u2019 inflation-adjusted incomes are declining this year for the first time since 2009, and for only the second time during the tenure of President Vladimir V. Putin. Because of the collapse of the ruble in December, Russians\u2019 incomes have plummeted: The average salary peaked in 2013 at $800 a month, and is projected this year to be about $400.The hamburger chain Wendy\u2019s has wound down business in Russia, as has the clothing store Esprit.The announcement from G.M. suggests that the carmaker is abandoning its bets on a rising Russian middle class, as it will cancel low-end models but still market the Cadillac and other expensive cars to the rich.The company will focus on premium brands in its lineup, like Corvette and Tahoe, along with Cadillac, while shuttering its car assembly plant in St. Petersburg, which had been mass-producing midsize Opel vehicles. All Opel sales will end this year.Russian regulation that encourages localization, and job creation, by requiring carmakers to commit to ever-greater use of locally produced parts also appeared to play a role in the decision. Opel said it made no sense to invest in further localization in a shrinking market.In St. Petersburg, a local official blamed the company, saying its cars were not selling well. G.M. had \u201can unlucky lineup of models,\u201d Maksim Meiksin, the head of a committee for industrial policy in St. Petersburg, told the news agency Tass. Workers would be placed at other factories, he said.Some business will continue. G.M. zoomed into Russia before other carmakers in the 1990s, setting up a joint venture at a storied Russian plant, the Volga Automobile Factory, the maker of Ladas, to manufacture a sport utility vehicle. That venture will go on, but not expand, the statement said.A separate contract with another Russian plant, the Gorky Automotive Factory, in Nizhny Novgorod, will wind down by the end of the year, ending a brief revival there of a long tradition of American and Russian automobile cooperation; Henry Ford sold the first assembly line there to the Soviet Union in the 1930s.In addition to severance pay, the $600 million one-time charge for General Motors\u2019 partial pullout from Russia will cover contract cancellations, restructuring at dealerships and lost tax incentives, the company said.Advertisement"}

About 2.5 billion people depend upon fish for food and nutrition. Unsustainable fishing practices also threaten their livelihoods, officials said.The administration also is raising the issue of illegal fishing and overfishing among Asian countries as it negotiates the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional agreement that includes four of the top 15 global producers of marine fisheries products by volume, including Vietnam and Japan.The trade agreement is expected to push to eliminate some fishery subsidies that some governments use to support their domestic fishing fleets and that conservationists say lead to overfishing.Conservation groups applauded the announcement.\u201cThis is a historic step forward to stop illegal fishing and seafood fraud,\u201d said Beth Lowell, senior campaign director at Oceana. \u201cThis shows that the administration is starting to put illegal seafood up on the same level as wildlife trafficking.\u201dLast month, the administration released a similar plan to target illegal wildlife trafficking.The National Fisheries Institute, a trade group of seafood producers, said that it supports most of the recommendations to fight illegal fishing, but that it also has concerns.\u201cThere is a need for this and we need to be bring attention to the problem,\u201d said Gavin Gibbons, a spokesman for the institute. \u201cBut our concern is who is going to pay for this and what exactly are we going to focus on? Is it just fish at risk or all seafood?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a senior campaign director at Oceana, an international organization that focuses on Oceans.

He has reined in his rambling speeches, at least compared with his recorded remarks over the years. He is trying to listen more and opine less, associates say, and he is easygoing with voters \u2014 a contrast with his pugilistic reputation from his successful battle against Wisconsin labor unions, which made him a hero to many conservatives.\u201cWhen I told Governor Walker that I went to the University of Alabama, he started rattling off Alabama players on the Green Bay Packers,\u201d said Rod Benfield, a South Carolina Republican who came away from a state party fund-raising event on Thursday \u201cvery impressed\u201d with Mr. Walker. \u201cWe talked football for five minutes. Politics never came up.\u201dNo other Republican considering a run for the presidency is under more pressure to show that he can vault from statewide popularity to top-tier contention than Mr. Walker, given his relative inexperience on the national stage and low name recognition in many states \u2014 no matter how much fervor he inspires in conservative circles.Is he a durable candidate with wide appeal? Or is he a flavor of the month \u2014 as former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Herman Cain were during the Republican nominating contests in 2012 \u2014 or a firebrand peaking too early, as Howard Dean did before the 2004 Democratic primaries?\u201cWalker has to show that his message goes beyond Wisconsin, that he is big enough \u2014 presidential enough \u2014 to handle national and international issues,\u201d said Bill Barlow, another Republican who attended the event on Thursday to check out the Wisconsin governor, who prevailed in a 2012 recall election. \u201cI think he can \u2014 he\u2019s won three governor\u2019s races in a Democratic state \u2014 but it\u2019s early.\u201dMr. Walker, 47, and his advisers were caught off guard, his associates say, by the momentum that built after some well-received speeches this winter and the strong showings in several recent polls. In South Carolina this week and in New Hampshire last weekend, he lowered his public profile, largely avoiding reporters to focus on private meetings with party members.\u201cEvery stumble Walker\u2019s had this winter are times when he was pushed to talk about issues he didn\u2019t want to talk about or face things he didn\u2019t want to face,\u201d said Charles Franklin, a Wisconsin political analyst and director of the Marquette Law School Poll. \u201cWalker has always been able to stick to his issues, but the national stage is going to test him to go deep on a range of issues that any president faces.\u201dWhile Mr. Walker is best known for his successful fight to strip many collective bargaining rights from most public sector unions in Wisconsin and his subsequent recall victory, he now brings up that dispute chiefly to thank people who prayed for his family while it was going on. But many voters still see him as a one-issue governor, as do his political opponents.\u201cScott Walker won\u2019t have a chance to win New Hampshire if he keeps attacking unions, because unions have helped generations of people here get ahead,\u201d said William Shaheen, who has helped run Democratic presidential campaigns in New Hampshire and is married to Senator Jeanne Shaheen.Donald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention.Aides to Mr. Walker declined several requests for an interview with him this month. But his spokeswoman, Kirsten Kukowski, described him as \u201cone of the most battle-tested governors in the country\u201d who wanted to take \u201creform-minded principles and highlight them to Republicans across the country.\u201d\u201cThe governor isn\u2019t going to light up a lot of rooms, though he\u2019s also not going to leave a room until he meets every person,\u201d said William J. McCoshen, a prominent Republican consultant in Wisconsin who is friendly with the Walker team. \u201cHis delivery has always been a plain-talk approach. Emotionally engaging with an audience generally hasn\u2019t been his style.\u201dThat is starting to change. After Mr. Walker delivered a long and limp speech behind a lectern to the Republican National Committee in January, Mr. Wiley and others helped the governor hone a shorter stump speech for his next big event, a week later at the Iowa Freedom Summit. Mr. Walker, who was used to writing his own remarks, practiced the speech and sought guidance about adding energy and emotion and sharpening his diction.The Iowa speech was deeply personal, with Mr. Walker going into detail about death threats he said he had received (\u201cone said they were gonna gut my wife like a deer\u201d) during the battle with organized labor, and he crisscrossed the stage to look a variety of audience members in the eye.In many ways, Mr. Walker demonstrated an instinctual grasp of the state. In addition to wearing the pullover sweaters, he focused on an anti-tax message certain to resonate with conservatives and independents in a place where opposition to taxes has long been a litmus test for Democrats as well as Republicans.During a speech in Concord last Saturday, he spoke about his \u201cobsession with lower taxes\u201d and championed \u201ccommon sense Republican conservative principles,\u201d in sync with the pragmatic small-government views of many state residents.Still, Mr. Walker has yet to move beyond his comfort zone of fellow Republicans and conservatives. He has not held a town hall-style meeting with cross-sections of voters who might challenge him on national issues.But he has been making headway at dinners like the one organized by Jennifer Horn, the chairwoman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. That night, Ms. Horn said, he described the coffees and house parties he did on the campaign trail in Wisconsin \u2014 the sort of retail politics expected of presidential candidates in New Hampshire. He traded stories about raising children \u2014 his two sons are now in college \u2014 and told a favorite anecdote about buying much of his clothing at a discount at Kohl\u2019s.And at the dinner, as well as in his Concord speech, his Wisconsin honk was noticeably absent.\u201cI didn\u2019t hear it,\u201d Ms. Horn said. \u201cGood for him, good for him.\u201dMonica Davey contributed reporting from Chicago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chasm Grows Within G.O.P. Over Spending ", "Date": "2015-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The congressional push this week to secure the first Republican budget plan in nearly a decade is revealing a chasm between fiscal hawks determined to maintain strict spending caps and defense hawks who are threatening to derail any budget that does not ensure an increase for the military.\u201cThis is a war within the Republican Party,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who has vowed to oppose a final budget that does not ensure more military spending. \u201cYou can shade it any way you want, but this is war.\u201dThe divisions will be laid bare Tuesday when congressional leaders unveil blueprints that hew to spending limits imposed by the budget battles of 2011.The struggle over the next three weeks to pass the budget plans represents the most serious test of whether Republican leaders meet their pledge to govern effectively in the majority.\u201cOh, we\u2019ll have a budget,\u201d promised Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.The budget plans that will be drafted Wednesday by the House and Senate Budget Committees are more symbol than substance. They do set overall spending levels for domestic and defense programs.What they cannot do is overturn a law signed by the president, the Budget Control Act of 2011, which imposed a decade\u2019s worth of spending caps and across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration. That will take yet another act by Congress, which defense hawks are trying to craft now, with the help of Democrats.For Republican leaders, orderly passage of a budget is imperative. Republicans harangued Senate Democrats for their repeated failure to pass budgets when they controlled the chamber.And they have promised conservative voters they will make good on their promises to fundamentally remake the federal government into a smaller, more limited force \u2014 with a budget that balances in 10 years.\u201cThis is not only possible. It\u2019s doable,\u201d Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming, the Budget Committee chairman, said last week.It will not be easy. President Obama has already proposed raising spending caps in the fiscal year that begins this October by nearly $80 billion, half for defense, half for domestic programs. Democrats in the House and Senate will offer no help to Republican leaders as they try to assemble a majority to approve plans that will be far more austere.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to have a lower number than the president of the United States is proposing, we have no credibility in saying we\u2019re committed to defending this nation,\u201d Mr. McCain said late last week, vowing to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to lift the defense caps, including making a deal with Democrats to bolster domestic spending.\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster,\u201d Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, one of those freshmen, said of the sequestration cap. \u201cThematically, we all agree sequestration must go.\u201dThe budget debate is coming as falling deficits have eased fiscal pressures. This month, the Congressional Budget Office updated its deficit forecast, projecting $486 billion in red ink this fiscal year, dropping to $455 billion next year. Measured against the economy, the deficit would fall from 2.7 percent of the gross domestic product to 2.4 percent, well below modern historical averages.The push to spend more is also intensifying, especially on defense. The warnings from the military\u2019s uniformed and civilian leadership have grown increasingly dire \u2014 deep cuts in personnel that would leave the smallest Air Force in history, tens of thousands of soldiers taken from the combat-ready units and dramatically scaled-back naval rapid-response forces. Democrats say vital nondefense programs are no less imperiled.Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said naval warships in the Arctic are only as effective as the Coast Guard icebreakers funded by the Department of Homeland Security that clear their path. The military can track drug shipments from South America, he added, but without a properly funded Justice Department, F.B.I. or Coast Guard, the homeland is not secure.But most conservative Republicans are not budging in the face of the sky-is-falling warnings. The most frightening predictions for sequestration did not pan out when the cuts hit in 2013. A bipartisan budget deal that year offered some relief through 2015, but when that deal expires Sept. 30, most Republicans are not eager to extend it. Even under the sequester, the limit on defense spending would be $523 billion for the 2016 fiscal year \u2014 slightly higher than the limit of $521 billion for 2015.The strict caps \u201care one of the best things that\u2019s happened to the finances of the country,\u201d said Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a senior Republican on the Budget Committee.Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is expected to seek the Republican presidential nomination, said he would not support lifting the caps. Lawmakers are scrambling to finesse the problem. Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, and Mr. Enzi are pressing for a place holder in the budget \u2014 a \u201cdeficit-neutral reserve fund\u201d \u2014 that they say would allow Congress to come back in the coming months with legislation to lift the spending caps.\u201cThe budget resolution is not going to allow us to change the law,\u201d Ms. Ayotte said.To some Republicans \u2014 and most Democrats \u2014 a \u201cdeficit-neutral reserve fund\u201d is a grand deception. Mr. Graham, a member of both the Budget and Armed Services Committees, said he would vote the budget out of committee this week, but without assurances that spending would rise, he would not vote for its final passage.That number may not supersede the legally binding cap, he said, but it instructs the House and Senate Appropriations Committees to override the caps later this year.\u201cDon\u2019t talk about national security,\u201d Mr. McCain warned his own party. \u201cDon\u2019t complain about the president of the United States if we are going to stick to the sequestration numbers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germans Protest European Austerity Measures", "Date": "2015-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than 200 demonstrators were injured by police bats and tear gas, Blockupy said, and the police said 94 officers were injured. \u201cThe violent acts of some activists were neither planned nor wanted,\u201d said Frauke Loew, a Blockupy spokeswoman.The size and intensity of the protests sent a strong signal that the German Blockupy movement was back after an earlier wave of activism petered out in 2012. But in contrast to the earlier, mostly mellow protests, there was a distinctly violent element on Wednesday, reflecting the political polarization that has built in the eurozone after four years of harsh cuts in government spending and astronomical unemployment in Greece and other troubled countries.Blockupy is a left-wing alliance of dozens of activist groups from across Europe. Its members include one of the largest German labor unions, the United Service Union, known as Ver.di, and Syriza, the left-wing, anti-austerity Greek political party that is now leading the government in Athens.Rosina Sfyridou, a German of Greek descent who lives in Frankfurt and was among a small group carrying a Syriza flag near the Main River at midday, said she wanted to fight for democracy and social justice, and not only in Greece.\u201cThe troika is making life difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cSchools are closing. Greeks can\u2019t get proper health care. I have family there; we\u2019re closer to the problem.\u201dPanagiotis Tsianakas, another German of Greek descent, headed to a central square to hear a speech by a Syriza representative, Giorgos Chondros. \u201cThe European finance ministers are brushing democracy to the side,\u201d Mr. Tsianakas said.Antagonism has been growing between Greece and Germany, Athens\u2019s biggest European lender. \u201cOur battle in Greece is a battle for all Europeans,\u201d Mr. Chondros told a cheering crowd of about 8,000. \u201cWe need a European organization against austerity, and that organization has started here today.\u201d Employees of the central bank began moving into the new headquarters, which cost about $1.27 billion, near the end of last year. Away from downtown Frankfurt on a park-like site overlooking the Main River, the 600-foot-high tinted-glass tower is a more potent symbol of the central bank\u2019s power than the generic gray high-rise in central Frankfurt that it previously occupied.The inauguration ceremony was scaled back in response to the protests. In addition, some European Central Bank employees were encouraged to work from home on Wednesday, though a central bank spokesman said the institution was \u201cfully operational.\u201dAs a European Union institution \u201cthat has played a central role throughout the crisis, the E.C.B. has become a focal point for those frustrated with this situation,\u201d Mr. Draghi said in prepared remarks. \u201cThis may not be a fair charge \u2014 our action has been aimed precisely at cushioning the shocks suffered by the economy. But as the central bank of the whole euro area, we must listen very carefully to what all our citizens are saying.\u201dSince 2012, activists have occasionally handed out leaflets in front of the central bank\u2019s headquarters, but there had been little organized protest in Frankfurt until Wednesday.The previous headquarters was the focal point of protests beginning in October 2011 as part of the global Occupy movement. The following year, an estimated 60 to 100 protesters encamped in a grassy area below the building until the police cleared it in August. The eviction took place without any major incidents.On Wednesday, many businesses near the headquarters shut their doors, and residents watched the action on the street from their windows, coffee and cameras in hand.One protester, a woman from Denmark who would give her name only as Sara, said she had arrived on an overnight bus with about 80 others to show her disdain for the way the capitalist system enriched some but impoverished others.\u201cI believe in fighting against the system,\u201d she said, taking a break in a bakery. \u201cIt won\u2019t change if you don\u2019t do something. I am here for solidarity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Road Show in Pursuit of Global Growth", "Date": "2015-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Rolex Australian Grand PrixBut since the acceleration of Formula One\u2019s worldwide expansion began a decade ago, so-called racing purists have bemoaned the loss of traditional tracks in countries where the series has deep historic roots and fan bases. A close look shows, however, that since its founding in 1950 the elite racing series has had a tradition of expanding to new countries, and in the process it has dropped almost none of the so-called traditional venues.More potential host countries are being considered, including Azerbaijan and Qatar. A race in Africa remains perhaps the most glaring absence.Australia, although not geographically in the series\u2019s West European cradle, is very much a traditional Formula One country, its race having existed through nearly half of the sport\u2019s history. Malaysia, which has staged races every year since 1999, is rarely considered a traditional country, even though its total of 18 races places it 18th in the all-time list and 14th among the countries on the 2015 calendar. This may be the last race for Malaysia, though, as it is weighing whether to renew its contract with Formula One.Belgium, Britain, Italy and Monaco are the only races on the calendar this season that were also part of the first Formula One season, in 1950. There were just seven races that year, including the Indianapolis 500, which counted for the championship.\u201cEach new territory brings with it multiple benefits,\u201d Gallagher wrote. \u201cNew audiences, more media, potential new sponsors from among the domestic, regional and global brands and the increased prestige that comes with the cumulative effect of racing in the largest economies combined with the most important developing ones.\u201dThe Australian Grand Prix is one of the sport\u2019s most popular races. Despite having paid its highest amount ever in public funding for the 2014 race \u2014 an estimated 60 million Australian dollars, or $46 million \u2014 the country last year extended its contract until 2020.While attendance is always high in Australia, other races are struggling. Among them is the German Grand Prix, which is experiencing difficulty even though a German team \u2014 Mercedes \u2014 is world champion and the German driver Sebastian Vettel is a four-time world champion. Last year attendance fell drastically: The Hockenheim race drew only 52,000 spectators, compared with 122,000 for the British Grand Prix two weeks earlier at Silverstone.It has not been confirmed which track \u2014 N\u00fcrburgring or Hockenheim \u2014 will stage the race scheduled for July 19, and it could be cancelled if the German organizers are unable to pay the host\u2019s fee.Meanwhile, some newer races, such as those in Abu Dhabi and Singapore, are among the most popular. The Singapore Grand Prix provides a night-time race experience, in a major Asian financial hub with plenty of off-track action and spectators from around Asia. With its street track running through the city, the race is sometimes called the Monaco of the East.\u201cThe whole point of the Singapore Grand Prix is that it takes place right in the heart of one of the most dynamic and most vibrant cities in the world,\u201d said Colin Syn, the Singapore Grand Prix deputy chairman in an article in the International Automobile Association\u2019s Auto magazine.Singapore has renewed its contract to hold the race until 2017. The Singapore Tourism Board said the race and related tourism bring in 560 million Singapore dollars, or about $404 million, to the local economy. The Grand Prix draws roughly 400,000 spectators, the board said, 40 percent of them from other countries.Mexico has for years been seeking a return to the calendar as the country has undergone rapid economic growth. The Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim has helped fund the careers of Mexican drivers, including Sergio P\u00e9rez and Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez, and is backing the return of the Grand Prix in Mexico City.A real test of tradition will be whether Monza, the home of the Italian Grand Prix since the 1920s, signs an extension with Formula One beyond the end of its contract this year. The Italian promoters are facing a local tax issue that could cost them millions of dollars, and Ecclestone has spoken of a possible loss of the race.\u201cMonza is the oldest circuit in Formula One, a record that we don\u2019t want to lose,\u201d Angelo Sticchi Damiani, the president of the Automobile Club d\u2019Italia, said last month. \u201cThe matter is complex and difficult.

{"Headline": "U.S. Oil Prices Fall to Six-Year Low", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOil prices fell to six-year lows on Monday in the face of concerns that a glut in the United States was outpacing already-brimming storage facilities.Additionally, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries published a report suggesting that the cartel remained reluctant to intervene to prop up prices.The direction of oil prices, which had risen sharply from January lows, has fallen back in recent days. Traders are now focused on the second quarter of the year, when demand for oil is traditionally weak because of the end of winter and scheduled refinery shutdowns for maintenance.On Monday, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the main United States benchmark, fell about 2 percent to about $44 a barrel, a six-year low, while Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell by about 2 percent to about $53 a barrel.Oil markets continue to focus on OPEC because its members could quickly alter the markets\u2019 balance by cutting production. But while some members, including Nigeria and Venezuela, would like to see cuts, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies show little inclination to change the policy they agreed to in the fall: Protect market share regardless of what happens to prices.While OPEC\u2019s competence at managing the market was always much in question, the organization\u2019s decision to stay on the sidelines has opened the way for volatile price movements.In the view of market participants, OPEC\u2019s role as the swing producer has moved to the United States and, in particular, to the producers of oil from shale rock. These companies have helped increase American production by more than four million barrels a day since 2009, far more than the combined increases in the rest of the world.Many analysts say that with low prices discouraging investment in drilling, production growth in the United States will level off and even begin to decline. But when this change will happen is a matter of speculation.A group of oil companies working in Texas and North Dakota and elsewhere is far different from the gatherings of OPEC oil ministers that decide whether to cut or increase supply at meetings in Vienna.\u201cA new math for oil has emerged,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an analyst at IHS Energy, a business information company in Washington. \u201cThe new math is the mix of variables that shape the pace and level of U.S. oil production as well as investment in high-cost sources of supply.\u201dMr. Bahree said that while the market was trying to find a new equilibrium, \u201cit is likely to flounder in the search for a new price range.\u201dOPEC made its own guess about when production might begin declining in the United States in its monthly oil report, published on Monday. Asserting that the output of a typical shale well can fall by 60 percent annually and noting the continued decline in the number of drilling rigs operating in the United States, OPEC suggested that \u201ca drop in production can be expected to follow, possibly by late 2015.\u201dWhile that might seem like encouraging news to oil producers, it also means that OPEC, or at least Saudi Arabia, may be in no hurry to cut production at the group\u2019s next meeting, in June.The Saudis argue that over time, economics will work in their favor because their oil costs a few dollars a barrel to produce, while oil from shale, deepwater wells and Canadian oil sands is much more expensive. The Saudis also contend that any move to prop up prices now will encourage more investment in production in the United States and elsewhere.In a speech on Sunday in Doha, Qatar, Ibrahim al-Muhanna, an adviser to the Saudi oil minister, also seemed to counsel patience. \u201cWe have a long-term view, and we do not make knee-jerk reactions to headlines,\u201d he said, according to a text of his speech.Mr. al-Muhanna said he was confident that demand from a strong global economy would prove sufficient to soak up supplies and that \u201cprices will firm up.\u201dOPEC\u2019s report on Monday was less sanguine. The group forecast that demand for its crude would average about 29.2 million barrels a day in 2015. That is about 800,000 barrels a day less than OPEC said it was producing in February.Advertisement"}

Funding the new bank is another effort by China to become an even more dominant influence in the region. The Americans worry that China could establish a parallel economic order that could weaken the World Bank and its affiliates and erode already strained international lending standards of transparency, creditworthiness, environmental sustainability, and concern for labor and human rights that took decades to put in place.By rushing to partner with China, which has one of the most opaque, most state-driven and least regulated economies, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain may hope to resist an American push for controls on speculative trading and preserve London\u2019s freewheeling ways despite the risk to global financial stability. He faces re-election on May 7 and is making economic growth the centerpiece of the campaign. There is also no doubt about Asia\u2019s need for more roads, bridges and other projects that the new bank is intended to underwrite.

However, Washington and its allies should have handled the challenge better.In significant ways, this is a problem of America\u2019s own making. The United States has urged China to exercise more leadership, but the top posts at the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have been restricted to Europeans, Americans and the Japanese. Congress bears considerable blame for refusing to pass legislation to shift voting power more fairly among I.M.F. member states, including China. China\u2019s move to create the new development bank is part of the price being paid for that obstruction. President Obama has also mishandled the issue. The American position of opposing the new bank until China accepts certain principles of governance and lending would have been more effective if the administration had worked with its allies to produce a set of common principles that could then be negotiated with the Chinese.Instead, it seems to have no coherent plan for dealing with the new bank. American and European officials say they are still pushing China to adopt international standards, with Britain and Germany demanding senior positions on the bank\u2019s board. But achieving that goal will most likely be harder when the Western allies are in a free-for-all dash to join China\u2019s new venture.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deadlines Near as Greece and Germany Seek a Consensus on Debt", "Date": "2015-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter an hour of talks, the two leaders were guarded at a news conference, and indicated no breakthrough in resolving Greece\u2019s debt troubles or its increasingly contentious negotiations with its European Union partners, who are demanding fresh reforms before offering more money to Athens.While talks over those difficult issues are certain to continue for weeks, the meeting Monday was more notable for the attempt by the two leaders to lower the temperature of the public sparring between Greece and Germany, respectively Europe\u2019s most troubled economy and its strongest.Ms. Merkel received Mr. Tsipras with military honors, and the two leaders were to continue their discussions over dinner. But their public interplay, at least, was characterized at times by smiles and a measure of warmth that has been notably absent as Greece\u2019s crisis has intensified, with Athens warning that without further relief in coming weeks it will be unable to pay its bills.\u201cIt should be really important that our work is marked by trust,\u201d said Ms. Merkel, who at 60 is 20 years older than the Greek leader. Mr. Tsipras, tieless as usual, noted that when Ms. Merkel called to invite him to Berlin, she had stressed that \u201cit is better to talk with each other than about each other.\u201d\u201cWe must define common ground,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said, \u201cAnd we must speak the language of truth and openly discuss our different opinions.\u201dFour weeks after undertaking to do so, Athens has yet to present a list of detailed reforms that it would carry out to get the next installment of credit from its three main creditors \u2014 the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission, which is acting on behalf of the 18 other members of the eurozone.The Greek failure to present clear demands has infuriated many Germans, with public opinion polls showing emotions rising against further rescue. In financial markets, analysts have talked more openly of the rising threat of a Greek exit, accidental or not, from the euro, although most still consider this unlikely.Mr. Tsipras wrote to Ms. Merkel on March 15 highlighting Greece\u2019s looming cash crunch, the Greek government spokesman, Gavriil Sakellaridis, told Greek television on Monday. He said the letter had also been sent to other European leaders, including President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission.\u201cIt\u2019s not a threat, it\u2019s reality,\u201d Mr. Sakellaridis said.Ms. Merkel emphasized that Germany, while important, cannot speak for the other nations in the eurozone and thus no binding agreements on Greece\u2019s debt could be expected Monday night.But it was clear that she and Mr. Tsipras recognized the need to ratchet down the emotions \u2014 about Nazi war crimes in Greece, or stereotypes of \u201clazy Greeks\u201d or mean Germans, as the Greek leader put it \u2014 and that their respective voters needed to see them do this together.Some Germans may have lost sight of the horror of Nazi occupation in Greece, Ms. Merkel noted. At least 80,000 Greeks were killed by the Germans. For his part, Mr. Tsipras said that a forced loan to the Nazis in 1942 was an ethical, moral issue, which he plainly regarded as outstanding, while the current German government said it considered the reparations issue closed.Most important, both leaders said, stereotypes should be abandoned. \u201cEurope is built on the idea that each country is as important as the other,\u201d Ms. Merkel said with some passion. \u201cEveryone has one vote and that is what characterizes our peaceful life together in Europe.\u201dSince the start of the Greek crisis almost five years ago, she noted, she had opposed talk of \u201cthe Italians, the Greeks, the Irish or the Germans.\u201d Making sweeping collective judgments \u201cis exactly what Europe is not,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am moved by this idea when I make politics. This is such a precious thing that we must make every effort to nurture it well in future.\u201dMr. Tsipras said of the talks so far: \u201cI must say that the chancellor listens and would like to make constructive progress.\u201dMore gravely, the question of whether Germany should pay more reparations to Greece for Nazi war crimes and forced loans has flared, with some leading figures on the German left ready to consider such payments.The magazine Der Spiegel summed it all up with a cover this week superimposing a picture of Ms. Merkel on an old photograph of Nazi commanders at the Parthenon in Athens under the headline, \u201cThe German \u00dcbermacht.\u201d In an accompanying article, it argued that fellow Europeans increasingly see Germany, which is Europe\u2019s biggest economy, and its leaders as dominant. \u201cYet they are rather a weak than a strong hegemon,\u201d Der Spiegel said of the Germans.Mr. Tsipras went out of his way to say that he found the cover \u201cvery unfair, unfair to the chancellor and to the German people.\u201d He was just as irritated, he said, by cartoons in publications of his political party, Syriza, that caricatured Germans as Nazis.\u201cYou cannot joke with history,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dark past \u2014 we must overcome.\u201dMr. Draghi bristled at accusations by one member of the European Parliament that the central bank was blackmailing Greece. He suggested it was the other way around. The European Central Bank\u2019s credit to Greece has more than doubled since December to 104 billion euros, or about $113 billion, he said.\u201cAre we blackmailing Greece?\u201d Mr. Draghi asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit rich when you look at our exposure to Greece.\u201dReporting was contributed by Melissa Eddy from Berlin, Dmitris Bounias and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Zero-Sum Moment ", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNational elections take place within a specific global moment. In the 1990s, there was a presumption that we were living in an age of rapid progress. Democracy was spreading. Tyranny was receding. Asia was booming. The European Union was building. Conflict in the Middle East was lessening. The world was cumulatively heading toward greater pluralism, individualism, prosperity and freedom.Today it\u2019s harder to have faith in rapid progress. Democracy is receding. Autocrats like Vladimir Putin of Russia are marching. The European project is decaying. Economies are struggling. Reactionary forces like the Islamic State and Iran are winning. The Middle East is deteriorating.In this climate, the tone and focus of politics change. Politics is less about win-win situations and more about zero-sum situations. It is less about reforms that will improve all lives and more about unadorned struggles for power. Who will control the ground in places like Ukraine and Syria? Will Iran get the bomb? Will the White House or Congress grab power over treaties and immigration policy?At these moments, tough guys do well. Cooperative skills are less valued while confrontational skills are more valued. Benjamin Netanyahu wins re-election in Israel. The pugnacious Nicolas Sarkozy, of all people, is staging a comeback in France. Putin is in his element.In these moments, right-leaning parties tend to do well and have a stronger story to tell on national security. They speak the language of nationalism and cultural cohesion. People who are economically insecure (and more likely to lean left) drop out of the political process.Both parties, though, change shape to fit the zero-sum contours of the moment. Progressives emphasize compassion less and redistribution more. Conservatives emphasize entrepreneurial dynamism less and the threat of government elites more. Electorates get a little uglier when faith in progress declines. Voters across the spectrum get more cynical and distrustful. They are quicker to perceive threats from The Other.For example, anti-Semitism is a good barometer of a worsening public mood. According to the Pew Research Center, acts of hostility toward Jews are now rampant in 39 percent of countries, up from 26 percent in 2007. The U.K. Community Security Trust registered 1,168 anti-Semitic incidents in Britain in 2014, more than double the number from the previous year.It\u2019s rare to have major realignments at a moment like this. Everybody is hunkered down and risk averse. Voters in this battened-down frame of mind are willing to elect familiar faces (better the devil you know). The Israeli, American and European electorates have been remarkably stable over the past decade. In Israel, for example, the overall vote that went to right-wing parties was stable from this election to last; it\u2019s just that the Likud Party grabbed a big share of the nationalist electorate.Still, you do see some shifts. Extreme parties rise, especially the ones that repel supposed interlopers and oppose elite global projects. We\u2019re seeing that across the globe with the Tea Party, UKIP in Britain, National Front on the right in France and Syriza on the left in Greece.Extreme parties rarely take power, but they do influence politics because mainstream politicians have to co-opt them. Mainstream politicians have to fight two-front wars: the official one against their ideological opponents and the unofficial one to silence, co-opt and crush the extremists on their own side.This is what Netanyahu did in Israel. He didn\u2019t literally renounce the idea of a two-state solution forevermore. He just said that it would be too dangerous in the near term as long as Islamist-style radicalism is on the march. (A defensible proposition.) Still, these comments and the ones on Israeli Arabs were blatant panders. He took Knesset seats away from parties to his right by becoming more like them.These conditions will influence the 2016 American election, too. I\u2019d guess that the cultural moment favors Scott Walker and Chris Christie, who have records of confrontation, over Jeb Bush, who hasn\u2019t won election in this era and has a softer mien. I\u2019d also say they strengthen Hillary Clinton. She has a Merkel-like toughness and may actually benefit from the familiar-face phenomenon.In general, the power of the cultural moment shapes the candidates. But occasionally there is a leader who can turn a negative popular mood into a positive one. F.D.R. and Reagan did this. But you have to be very, very good.Advertisement"}

Economists are expecting a 0.2 percent rise in the headline number for the Consumer Price Index in February, with core prices excluding the volatile energy and food sectors to have risen by 0.1 percent.In terms of the overall number, gas prices rebounded a bit in February while food costs are estimated to have fallen, most likely producing a slight increase in the C.P.I.Facebook, the social network, will hold its annual conference for application developers in San Francisco on Wednesday and Thursday.The Financial Stability Board, an international panel of top central bankers and bank regulators that is working on ways to prevent future financial crises, holds a meeting on Thursday of its plenary members in Frankfurt.When the Federal Reserve\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, speaks Friday afternoon in San Francisco, there is good reason to listen a little more carefully. Last week the Fed ended the five-year postcrisis period in which it provided explicit guidance about the future level of short-term interest rates.On Friday, the Commerce Department releases its third and final estimate of the annualized rate of economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. After initially estimating a 2.6 percent rate in January, government statisticians revised that downward to 2.2 percent last month. The final estimate could rise to 2.4 percent, economists say, but a major revision is unlikely.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert Kastenmeier, Liberal Voice in House for 32 Years, Dies at 91", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobert W. Kastenmeier, a Wisconsin Democrat who in 32 years in the House was an early opponent of the Vietnam War and in 1976 earned the gratitude of authors when he managed the first general revision of copyright law since 1909, died on Friday at his home in Arlington, Va. He was 91.His wife, Dorothy C. Kastenmeier, confirmed his death.The 1976 law that Mr. Kastenmeier helped pass extended copyright protection for an author\u2019s entire life plus 50 years. Under the 1909 law, it had protected authors for no more than 56 years.Mr. Kastenmeier represented Wisconsin\u2019s Second District, encompassing Madison, the capital, from 1959 to 1991. A steadfast liberal \u2014 he had a lifetime voting score of 97 percent from the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action \u2014 he had strong misgivings about American military involvement in Vietnam as early as 1965, when he held an unusual, unofficial hearing in his district to determine grass-roots opinion on the war.He had earlier joined 28 other House members in unsuccessfully pressing the House Foreign Affairs Committee to hold hearings in Washington.At the district hearing, in a Methodist church in Madison, a University of Wisconsin graduate student presented a campus petition with 6,000 signatures endorsing American policy in Vietnam. Mr. Kastenmeier asked, \u201cAt the risk of being unfair, would any of the 6,000 volunteer?\u201d The student replied that 98 percent would.But on issues like copyright and patents, which came to his subcommittee, Mr. Kastenmeier had little difficulty in working closely with Republicans, like Tom Railsback of Illinois.\u201cCopyright and intellectual property is basically not ideological,\u201d Mr. Kastenmeier said in an interview for this obituary in 2012, adding, \u201cIf you think the law has to be changed, updated, that doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with being conservative or liberal.\u201dNorman J. Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, called Mr. Kastenmeier the \u201cmodel\u201d congressman who spent a career developing specialized legislative expertise.\u201cHe picked an area that was obscure on its face but extraordinarily important, if you look at intellectual property as a spur to innovation in the global economy,\u201d Mr. Ornstein said.Mr. Kastenmeir\u2019s other specialty was the federal judiciary. As a Judiciary subcommittee chairman, he produced a measure that greatly reduced the range of cases Congress could direct the Supreme Court to review. The bill, he said, would give \u201csubstantial assistance to the court in managing its heavy caseload.\u201dHe also managed legislation that rearranged the geographical jurisdictions of federal appeals courts and, in another bill, increased the powers of federal magistrates.When Mr. Kastenmeier was defeated by Scott L. Klug, a Republican and local television anchor, in his bid for a 17th term in 1990, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and his predecessor, Warren E. Burger, both hailed him as a friend and supporter of the federal judiciary.But his central focus was intellectual property \u2014 copyright, patents and trademarks. He was the author of 48 laws in that area, 21 of them dealing with copyright. Many reflected technological advances. The landmark 1976 bill set rules governing radio, television, photocopying, tape recording, microfilming and computer storage, breaking a 15-year logjam on a subject that bored most lawmakers.In the 1980s he wrote copyright-protection measures covering computer software and semiconductor chips and another that gave cellphones wiretap protection, previously available only for landlines.In 1977, the Authors Guild honored him for protecting the rights of American authors.Robert William Kastenmeier was born in Beaver Dam, Wis., on Jan. 24, 1924. After graduating from public high school, he entered the Army in 1943. He was on his way to combat in the Pacific as a second lieutenant when the war ended in 1945. Discharged in 1946, he stayed on in the Philippines until 1948 as a branch office director handling war claims.After earning a bachelor\u2019s degree from Carleton College in Minnesota and a law degree at the University of Wisconsin in 1952, he practiced in Watertown for six years. He was elected to the House, on his second try, in 1958. In a district centered in liberal Madison, he was re-elected 15 times.Besides his wife, the former Dorothy Chambers, whom he married in 1952, Mr. Kastenmeier is survived by his sons William, Andrew, and Edward and two grandchildren.After Republicans took control of the House in 1995 for the first time in 40 years, Mr. Kastenmeier complained that \u201c\u2019Democrats now seem to feel the need to become more accommodating, more conservative.\u201d\u201cThe party has backed off on its liberal agenda, and that\u2019s a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t wrong.\u201dMr. Kastenmeier balanced his liberalism with pragmatism in the interest of getting things done. And while he was a severe critic of Nixon, he persuaded fellow Democrats that the president\u2019s lawyers should be able to participate in the impeachment inquiry.And he did not have much use for ceremony. A longtime aide, Michael J. Remington, recalled that Mr. Kastenmeier avoided presidential signing ceremonies of bills he had written.Even more modestly, Mr. Remington said, Mr. Kastenmeier did something almost unheard of on Capitol Hill: \u201cHe chastised his staff for drafting press releases that were too laudatory.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an obituary on Saturday about the former Wisconsin congressman Robert W. Kastenmeier referred incorrectly to his position in the House when he and other members pressed the Foreign Affairs Committee to hold hearings on the Vietnam War in 1965. He was not a member of that committee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Ending Health Subsidies Means ", "Date": "2015-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIf the Supreme Court rules that no federal tax credit subsidies can be provided to Americans buying insurance on federal health exchanges in 34 states, the economic effects could be devastating. Some 7.5 million people who qualified for subsidies this year could have them yanked away after a court decision, and more than nine million people would be unable to get subsidies in 2016. State economies would suffer, insurance markets would be disrupted, millions of people would lose coverage, hospitals and insurance plans that have counted on revenues from newly insured people would be left high and dry, and people who continue to hold policies would pay a lot more for them. The health care markets in which individuals and families buy their own policies \u2014 on the exchanges and outside them \u2014 would fall into chaos. With subsidies no longer available, the younger, healthier and less costly people to insure would decide to go without insurance, and insurers would be forced to jack up their premiums for the remaining people, likely sicker and requiring more health care. That would trigger a so-called death spiral that would cause more people to drop out and rates to rise even higher, making things worse than they were before the reform law was enacted. Hospitals that hired lots of health care workers to meet the anticipated demand would presumably have to lay them off. Insurers that set their rates on the assumption of high volume would have to recalibrate them and might leave the market. Trade groups for both hospitals and insurers have urged the Supreme Court to retain the subsidies.With people thrown off insurance, the states and their hard-pressed hospitals and doctors would also have to absorb much of the cost of uncompensated care. The Hospital Corporation of America, a gigantic health care system, estimates that uninsured patients are three times more likely than insured patients to use its emergency rooms, which are far more costly than outpatient clinics.The Obama administration has said that it has no backup plan to cope with the loss of subsidies. The congressional Republicans who want to destroy Obamacare offer no meaningful plans to deal with the consequences. Beyond economic damage, the lack of insurance almost always means that sick people get less care, with greater risk of death. The leading professional societies that battle cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and multiple sclerosis, in a brief to the court, cited extensive evidence that patients with adequate insurance are more likely to have their diseases managed or cured at an early stage, while uninsured patients tend to seek help only when the disease is advanced and treatment is ineffective and costly. For instance, among patients with diabetes, 42 percent who lacked health insurance were undiagnosed compared with 26 percent for those with insurance, according to a 2008 study. A study using 2011-12 data put the numbers at 32 percent and 15 percent. The American Public Health Association and faculty members at schools of public health warned the court that ending the subsidies would result in more than 9,800 additional deaths a year. The political opponents of Obamacare seem to think this fight is about ideology. What they refuse to acknowledge is the human toll and the economic devastation that destroying the heart of health reform will bring about. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greeks Need Their Leader to Be Tough", "Date": "2015-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyDoes Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister of Greece, have the guts to break with his far-left faction? The country\u2019s fate hangs on the answer.Greece\u2019s immediate prospects are dicey. It will default in mid-April unless its eurozone creditors lend it more money or it scrapes together cash from other sources.The central short-term issue is whether the reform proposals that Athens plans to submit to creditors on Monday will be enough to unlock some credit. The government sent negotiators to Brussels over the weekend to hash out the package after another week during which the technical teams on the ground in Athens achieved little. Meanwhile, Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister, mused publicly about the possibility of a \u201crupture.\u201d The implication was that Athens would default if it were not able to secure an acceptable deal with its creditors. Such a rupture could happen as early as April 9, when Greece has to repay money it owes the International Monetary Fund. If Athens defaults then, capital controls would presumably be imposed at the same time, coinciding with the four-day Greek Easter holiday, which starts on April 10.Mr. Tsipras might toy with the idea of calling a snap election to gain renewed support from the Greek people for such a tough line. Given that the opposition is in disarray and his own popularity is riding high, he might hope to win such a vote. But the government\u2019s approval has already fallen from 83 percent in February to 60 percent last week, according to a poll for Alpha TV. Its popularity would probably plunge further since cash machines would run out of money within days and key commodities such as petrol might have to be rationed after capital controls were imposed.If Mr. Tsipras were rational, he would want to avoid this scenario. The problem is that he would then have to make a deal with his creditors, which would also be painful. That would most likely require him not just to make promises but to start implementing them before any more cash was released.This is where the prime minister will run into a confrontation with his far-left faction, which accounts for 30 to 40 of his Syriza party\u2019s 149 members in Parliament. They will accuse him of selling out and may well vote against the laws needed to implement a deal with the country\u2019s creditors.Mr. Tsipras would probably still be able to pass legislation with the help of some opposition parties. But such an arrangement could not last for long. In that scenario, the most sensible move would be to call a second election. The prime minister could then kick out his far-left faction and replace its members of Parliament with moderates. Mr. Tsipras could win the election with an enhanced majority.The snag is that the prime minister would have to summon the courage to break with his political comrades. It is unclear whether he is tough enough to do this.Meanwhile, there is a risk that the government will charge off in the wrong direction, even if it secures a quick fix with its creditors in the next week or so. It has promised to deliver a 1.5 percent fiscal surplus before interest payments this year, according to Reuters. But this seems impossible without further austerity measures, which would crush the economy.Mr. Tsipras may think he will be a hero at home if he secures an agreement for a 1.5 percent surplus. After all, the current agreement calls for a 3 percent surplus. But since that deal was made, the economy\u2019s prospects have deteriorated. Political uncertainty has shattered confidence and lack of liquidity is choking off business. The European Central Bank has kept Greek banks on a tight leash, while the government itself has grabbed every little bit of cash it can get its hands on to keep from going bust.Athens is still predicting 1.4 percent growth this year. But it will be lucky to grow at all.Things will settle down only if the government reaches a new long-term deal with its creditors, for which the current discussions are just the preliminary skirmishing.In other words, Mr. Tsipras is setting himself up for failure by promising a 1.5 percent surplus. He needs to find a way off this hook. The problem is that Mr. Tsipras has not convinced his creditors that he is serious about reform or that his team is remotely on top of the detail. He needs a game-changer. This should, indeed, be a rupture \u2014 but with his left faction, not his creditors.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Giant Retirement Community That Explains Where Americans Are Moving", "Date": "2015-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMigration PatternsThe Villages, Fla., an hour northwest of Orlando, may be the only retirement community that is also the center of its own census-designated statistical area. It also holds another distinction: In 2014, its population rose more quickly than that of any other census area in the United States, climbing 5.4 percent, compared with 0.7 percent for the nation as a whole.Where is the population growing fastest? Places that are warm, places that have ample affordable housing and places that are popular retirement destinations. It is an old story. But during the housing bust, local real estate conditions varied so much that this basic pattern broke down, as people responded to collapsing home prices above all. In 2014, the old pattern reasserted itself.Besides the Villages, the top places for population gains last year included the metro areas of Myrtle Beach, S.C.; Austin, Tex.; and Fort Myers, Fla. Some of the metro areas with the lowest numbers \u2014 in these cases outright contraction of population \u2014 included Elmira, N.Y.; Danville, Ill.; and Johnstown, Pa.In other words, old, established Northeastern and Midwestern cities lost population or barely held even, while Sun Belt places with affordable housing added people, which has been a dominant story in United States demographic change for decades now.Consider this: If you know how quickly a place added population from 1980 to 2000, you can predict with pretty good confidence how quickly its population grew in 2014. The correlation between those two numbers was a whopping 0.82 (if they correlated perfectly, that number would be 1), according to calculations by Jed Kolko, the chief economist of Trulia.\u201cWhat\u2019s striking is how high that correlation is despite all of the effects of the housing market and migration that the housing bubble and bust had,\u201d Mr. Kolko said.By contrast, in 2009, when the housing bust was underway, the correlation was only 0.56. Knowing a region\u2019s population trend at the end of the 20th century told you something about how it was doing in 2009, just not much compared with 2014, when more of the effects of the housing bust had worked their way through.What is interesting about seeing the pre-housing crisis trend reassert itself is that it seems to be rooted in a broad shift in how Americans want to live. A close look at the data shows that a warm climate and affordability indeed seem to be the common threads in most of the places growing quickly, particularly because of migration within the United States.Last year, for example, places where the average January high temperature was over 60 degrees added population at more than six times the rate of places where the average January high was below 35 degrees.The relationship between home prices and domestic migration exists but is less strong, according to Mr. Kolko\u2019s analysis, with a negative .25 correlation between a metro area\u2019s median home price per square foot and its population change as a result of people moving within the United States. In other words, places that are more expensive have weaker population growth, though with quite a few places that break the trend.In effect, he found, two big trends support this basic idea of cheaper housing leading to more population, while one worked against it.Americans really are moving out of some of the most expensive cities for cheaper digs. Think of retirees cashing out in New York for something more affordable in Florida, or families in the industrial Midwest who see good job opportunities and plenty of affordable housing in Texas.But there are also plenty of places where the local economy has been so weak for so long that there is a combination of inexpensive housing and population outflow, like some of those cities where population fell in 2014.\u201cHigh home prices are sufficient to push many people out, but affordable housing by itself doesn\u2019t necessarily pull people in,\u201d Mr. Kolko said.Add this all up, and what do the latest census population numbers tell us?These longstanding, pre-crisis patterns for how Americans migrate exist for a reason: People want a combination of good weather, affordable housing and good job opportunities. And if a place combines those factors, people will come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congress\u2019s Critical Role on Trade ", "Date": "2015-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn recent years, trade agreements have become increasingly comprehensive, covering subjects that go far beyond familiar trade issues like tariffs and quotas. The T.P.P. negotiators, for instance, are discussing labor rights, environmental protection, patent and copyright law and how governments treat state-owned businesses. Done right, such deals can raise standards everywhere, protecting workers and opening new markets for American businesses. But there are potential downsides, too, including possible job losses. Congress has a responsibility to give the American negotiators, in advance of any agreement, clear instructions on what it would like to see in the agreement. The vehicle for doing so is a bill that could be introduced this week. The bill would also commit lawmakers to an up-or-down vote without amendment on the final deal if the deal meets the criteria established in the legislation. This is designed to give other countries assurance that Congress will not amend an agreement after it has been negotiated.Even though the final trade deal may not be done for months, it is critical that lawmakers act now to demand strong provisions protecting the right of workers to unionize, preventing wanton environmental damage and preserving access to generic drugs for consumers in poor countries. They should also seek to prohibit T.P.P. countries from deliberately manipulating their currencies. In addition to the currency issue, Congress should also extend the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which provides needed aid to workers hurt by trade deals. The program expires at the end of this year. Congress needs to use the leverage it has to have its voice heard. Otherwise, legislators cannot be fully involved in shaping agreements that cover many complex issues and could result in big changes to domestic laws. Advertisement"}

In December, for example, the painter R. H. Quaytman put abstract painting and architecture on a collision course with challenging, if decidedly confused, awkward results. Now the Swiss-born, Berlin-based artist Claudia Comte makes her American debut with roughly the opposite: a sculptural-architectural ensemble resembling a designer boutique, home furnishings store or art fair stand. This totality makes a delightful first impression, but its sources and references are startlingly obvious.With its palindromic title, \u201cNo Melon No Lemon\u201d operates in a populous artistic zone where Modernist quotation chases its tail often with diminishing returns. The main elements here \u2014 displayed on and against striped pedestals and walls \u2014 are sculptures carved in lustrous woods like cherry, walnut, acacia, yew and pear. These objects suggest derivatives of works by Brancusi, Arp and Calder; more ersatz thrift-shop finds; and in one case a squat version of McDonald\u2019s golden arches. The stripes on some walls are yellow and white, fading in and out, with matching paintings that conjure a mixture of Daniel Buren, Op Art, shaped canvases and serial art. Other gallery walls and four free-standing partitions are covered with wood painted black and hand-routed to create vertical off-white pinstripes redolent of early Frank Stella. In the best structural detail, long sections cut from the black walls, and hinged, form the pedestals. Their placement ranges from very high to very low (get it?) and adds a note of economy consistent with the artist\u2019s easy command of decorative space, scale and proportion.It seems likely that Ms. Comte, who is in her early 30s, has more up her sleeve than this.

{"Headline": "The Greek Government\u2019s Bind", "Date": "2015-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsGreece has no good Plan B. Its only rational course of action is to work with its eurozone creditors to reform its economy.Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, is in a bind. He agreed to a short-term deal with other eurozone governments two weeks ago. But he has found it difficult to sell this to hard-liners in his radical left Syriza party back home, who accuse him of a U-turn.Some of the subsequent rhetoric from Mr. Tsipras\u2019s ministerial colleagues, like the promises to cancel privatizations, has been troubling. So have decisions like raising the salaries of electricity workers.Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister, has sent a rather thin list of proposed reforms to his eurozone counterparts in advance of a meeting on Monday. He has also raised the possibility of holding a second election or a referendum if Greece meets with intransigence from its creditors. But it is unclear whether such a possible appeal to the voters may be the precursor to further U-turns by the government or an exit from the euro or may have some other purpose. Mr. Varoufakis will have much explaining to do.If Greece is to secure a long-term pact with its creditors by the end of June, Mr. Tsipras will have to abandon most of his election promises. Given the difficulties he is having in delivering on even the short-term pact, there is a temptation to cast around for alternatives.Some members of Syriza want Greece to regain its financial independence by defaulting on its debts and cutting loose from the euro. Pundits like Wolfgang M\u00fcnchau of The Financial Times want Greece to threaten to default while staying within the single currency \u2014 and to use that as a tactic to secure a better deal from its creditors.Mr. Tsipras should resist those siren voices. Their advice will lead to disaster, as Odysseus, the ancient Greek mythological hero, knew well when he had himself tied to his ship\u2019s mast so he could listen to the sirens but not do their bidding.Look first at the option of default combined with exiting the euro. This is superficially attractive because Greece\u2019s debt would be cut to more manageable levels, and bringing back the drachma would allow the country to devalue its currency and strenghten its competitiveness.The snag is that the transition would be nightmarish. It could be managed only by imposing severe capital controls until the new currency was introduced \u2014 a process that would take several months given the need to jump through political, legal and logistical hoops. Otherwise, the Greek people would merely take their money out of the banks, knowing that their euros would be replaced with devalued drachmas.Capital controls were introduced in Cyprus two years ago when its banks were restructured and are only due to be lifted this month. But if controls were imposed in Greece to coincide with a default, the Cypriot ones would look like a walk in the park.After all, Nicosia didn\u2019t default on its debt and was working with its creditors toward a mutually acceptable solution. As a result, the European Central Bank flew in piles of cash, people were allowed to take 300 euros a day out of their accounts and companies were able to pay for imports.By contrast, Athens would have stopped paying its creditors, including not just other eurozone governments but also the E.C.B. It\u2019s pie in the sky to suppose that, in such circumstances, Europe\u2019s central bank would feed the cash machines or supply liquidity so businesses could bring in vital commodities like oil and medicines. This would worsen the humanitarian crisis and possibly set off a new depression.It\u2019s not just that the transition to the drachma would be terrible. The aftermath would also be appalling, as taxes would have plummeted and the newly broke government would not be able to borrow abroad.In such circumstances, a responsible government would tighten its belt, cut spending and run a balanced budget. But what chance is there of Syriza, which was voted in on a promise to increase spending, doing that? Instead, it might take the irresponsible option: printing drachmas to fill the hole in its finances and so fuelling inflation and, ultimately, hyperinflation.What, then, about the other supposed Plan B: defaulting while staying in the euro? That would be miserable, too.Such a move would bankrupt the Greek banking system. Because Athens would no longer be able to get funds from its eurozone partners to recapitalize the banks, the only option would be to \u201cbail in\u201d depositors \u2014 converting a portion of the money in their accounts into shares in the banks, along the lines of what was done in Cyprus. For the duration of such an operation, capital controls would have to be introduced.The newly broke government, meanwhile, would have to balance its budget. This would be hard given that the depositor bail-in plus capital controls would deaden economic activity.The state might, therefore, be tempted to pay salaries, pensions and other obligations with I.O.U.s. This would be extremely unpopular, because the recipients would view them as worth a fraction of real euros. The I.O.U.s would start to circulate as a parallel currency, trading at a discount to euros and seen as the probable precursor to the reintroduction of drachmas.Given that no supposed Plan B is any good, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s best bet is to persuade his creditors of his good faith and push ahead with vigorous reforms in the hope that they will relax some of their demands. If that means breaking with his far-left faction and calling a new election or a referendum to validate a U-turn in his promises, so be it. His duty is to the Greek people as a whole.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Greece, Desperate Times and Offbeat Measures ", "Date": "2015-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Despite the European accord last month to extend a financial lifeline to Greece, Athens is rapidly running out of cash.So it is scrambling to find new, even radical ways to fill the shortfall \u2014 including a proposal to recruit citizens and tourists to spy on suspected tax evaders.That includes a proposal to enlist \u201ccasual\u201d tax spies \u2014 tourists, students, housekeepers and other nonprofessional inspectors \u2014 \u201cto pose, after some basic training, as customers, on behalf of the tax authorities, while wired for sound and video,\u201d according to a letter accompanying the proposals that the Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, sent last week to Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers.With tax arrears in Greece at \u20ac76 billion, the proposal is intended to scare tax dodgers and engender \u201ca new tax compliance culture,\u201d the letter said.In the near term, Athens is scrambling for additional ways to pay its bills. The possibilities include borrowing from government pension and social security funds, withholding payments to hospitals and universities or dipping into subsidies for farmers.Jens Bastian, a financial consultant in Athens and a former member of the European Commission\u2019s task force on Greece, said such measures underscored the depth of the country\u2019s financial problems. \u201cThe situation is dire, and this government is finding out in real time how difficult it is to meet its multiple obligations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt tells you something about the sheer level of desperation they face to identify any funding resources wherever they can pinch pennies.\u201dAlthough European officials have agreed to disburse an additional \u20ac7 billion from Greece\u2019s \u20ac240 billion bailout program, they are holding tight to the money through at least April \u2014 unless the Tsipras government pledges not to roll back austerity without their say-so and is able to push through various structural changes in the economy.The Brussels session on Monday with the Eurogroup will be the latest in a series of crisis-driven meetings about Greece since Mr. Tsipras\u2019s Syriza-party-led government was voted into office in January on the promise of striking a better deal for its austerity-weary citizens.But with money running out, Mr. Tsipras is confronting a cold truth: After five years of being supported by international bailouts, Greece has still not made enough progress in restructuring the economy and improving tax collection to stand on its own, making it hard to press anti-austerity claims with creditors.The problem reverberates beyond government balance sheets. Spyros Xanthis, the managing director of Xanthis, a family-owned marine exporting company in the port of Piraeus, said that last summer business had just begun to stabilize from a slump of 50 percent during the crisis. But renewed uncertainty about Greece\u2019s financial stability \u2014 and especially concerns that Greece might default or worse \u2014 has dealt a fresh blow to his international sales.\u201cNow everything we regained has been lost,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are back to where we started.\u201dGreece\u2019s cash position improved modestly over the last two years, but it has recently started to decline again. The government had \u20ac6.6 billion euros on deposit at the Greek central bank in January, compared with \u20ac7.1 billion in December, partly because of an unexpected \u20ac1 billion shortfall in January tax receipts.On Thursday, the European Central Bank, one of Greece\u2019s biggest creditors, did agree to add \u20ac500 million to an emergency credit line for Greece\u2019s commercial banks. But the central bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, said any further assistance to Athens would depend on whether the Tsipras government was willing to make significant economic changes.Greece\u2019s financial situation will probably grow worse before it improves. In the middle of 2014, it was experiencing a mild recovery after a half-decade recession in which the economy shrank by one-fourth. But the gross domestic product fell 0.4 percent in the October-December period, compared with the preceding quarter. If growth shrinks again in the first quarter as expected, Greece will officially re-enter a recession.At Mr. Xanthis\u2019s marine goods export firm, the crisis took a toll beyond sales. While none of his 11 employees were laid off, he said, they all agreed to take pay cuts of up to 35 percent to help make up for losses. In turn, they cut their personal spending on nearly everything but necessities.Mr. Xanthis fears the potential consequences if Greece\u2019s financial situation worsens. \u201cIt would be catastrophic if Greece were to exit the eurozone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would take years before there was a recovery.\u201dNearby, in Piraeus, just south of Athens, Paul Politakis, the owner of a men\u2019s clothing shop, said sales of his suits, shirts and accessories had started to fall again after last year\u2019s slight recovery. Even though he has lowered his prices, \u201cpeople don\u2019t have enough money to spend,\u201d Mr. Politakis said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a country that still has 25 percent unemployment, and millions of people who owe taxes and money to the state that they can\u2019t pay.\u201dLast week, the government exhorted Greeks to pay their taxes \u2014 or at least pay what they could. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our patriotic duty,\u201d Mr. Varoufakis said.To gain access to early bailout aid, the letter Mr. Varoufakis will present in Brussels on Monday includes the creation of a so-called fiscal council to generate savings, new rules for lottery and gambling licenses aimed at raising revenue and streamlining the bureaucracy to stimulate business investment.The package will also include \u201chumanitarian relief\u201d proposals, including the provision of food stamps to 300,000 poor Greeks and the reconnection of electricity to struggling households whose utility bills the government will partly pay. The authorities will also let tax debtors use installments to pay off what they owe. Greece will need to offset those costs through other cuts, or tax increases, if it is to persuade creditors to dispense the bailout money.To avoid default, Greece found a way to pay this month\u2019s bills, which include \u20ac1.53 billion owed to the International Monetary Fund by March 20. A first payment on that amount, around \u20ac300 million, was made on Friday.But this month, Greece must also pay around \u20ac4.6 billion in Treasury bill redemptions, and at least \u20ac1 billion in government salary and pension obligations.Things will not necessarily become easier after that. From April through August, Greece will need to finance an additional \u20ac10.2 billion in Treasury bill redemptions and repay approximately \u20ac3.17 billion to the I.M.F and \u20ac6.5 billion to the European Central Bank.Given those burdens, some European officials say Greece may need its third bailout since 2010.Last week, Spain\u2019s finance minister said European creditors were discussing a new Greek lifeline of \u20ac30 billion to \u20ac50 billion. Although officials in Athens and Brussels denied that talks were underway, many analysts consider it only a matter of time before Greece requires a new rescue package.But for now, Greece has no choice but to figure out how pay its own way, Dimitris Mardas, Greece\u2019s deputy finance minister, said in an interview.\u201cWe ourselves will pay our obligations,\u201d Mr. Mardas said.Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Poor Are the Poor?", "Date": "2015-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is a consensus among poverty experts that over the past 50 years there has been some improvement in the condition of the poor.\u201cAnyone who studies the issue seriously understands that material poverty has continued to fall in the U.S. in recent decades, primarily due to the success of anti-poverty programs\u201d and the declining cost of \u201cfood, air-conditioning, communications, transportation, and entertainment,\u201d David Autor, a professor of economics at M.I.T., wrote in response to my query.Despite the rising optimism, there are disagreements over how many poor people there are and the conditions they live under. There are also questions about the problem of relative poverty, what we are now calling inequality. Poverty cannot be viewed in isolation from the larger economy. We must take disparities in the way the benefits of growth and productivity are distributed into account.Jencks argues that the actual poverty rate has dropped over the past five decades \u2013 far below the official government level \u2014 if poverty estimates are adjusted for food and housing benefits, refundable tax credits and a better method of determining inflation rates. In Jencks\u2019s view, the war on poverty worked.Democratic supporters of safety net programs can use Jencks\u2019s finding that poverty has dropped below 5 percent as evidence that the war on poverty has been successful.At the same time liberals are wary of positive news because, as Jencks notes:It is easier to rally support for such an agenda by saying that the problem in question is getting worse than by saying that although the problem is diminishing, more still needs to be done.The plus side for conservatives of Jencks\u2019s low estimate of the poverty rate is the implication that severe poverty has largely abated, which then provides justification for allowing enemies of government entitlement programs to further cut social spending.Jencks\u2019s conclusion: \u201cThe absolute poverty rate has declined dramatically since President Johnson launched his war on poverty in 1964.\u201d At 4.8 percent, Jencks\u2019s calculation is the lowest poverty estimate by a credible expert in the field.No one casts doubts on Jencks\u2019s expertise. Nevertheless, his conclusion \u2014 that instead of the official count of 45.3 million people living in poverty, the number of poor people in America is just under 15 million \u2014 understates the scope of hardship in this country.In order to participate fully in the social life of a community, individuals may need a level of resources that is not too inferior to the norms of a community. For example, the clothing budget that allows a child not to feel ashamed of his school attire is much more related to national living standards than to strict requirements for physical survival.Timothy Smeeding, a professor of public affairs and economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, notes in an email that that \u201cthe official poverty line was about half of median income in 1963, but is less than 30 percent of median now because of general economic growth.\u201dJacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale, pointed out to me in an email that using a relative measure shows that the United States lags well behind other developed countries:Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, responded by email to my question on the relative measure:Most Americans are probably relativists when it comes to thinking about poverty today. Even if they acknowledge that the absolute living standards of fellow citizens in the bottom 15 percent of the income distribution have improved over time, they probably think of poverty in terms of the economic and social distance between someone in the exact middle of the distribution and a person who is near the bottom.While the United States \u201chas achieved real progress in reducing absolute poverty over the past 50 years,\u201d according to Burtless, \u201cthe country may have made no progress at all in reducing the relative economic deprivation of folks at the bottom.\u201dBurtless\u2019s point goes to the heart of the dispute: How severe is the problem of poverty?Part of the answer hinges on which measures you use to calculate inflation. Measures that show a higher rate of inflation will increase the number of poor people because the cost of basic necessities rises at a faster clip. A measure that shows a slower rate of inflation will lead to the appearance of reduced poverty levels because the cost of food, shelter and other needs will be lower.Fremstad notes that using the P.C.E. measure, \u201can elderly couple was not poor in 2013 if they had an income, including housing and food benefits, equal to $11,300.\u201d Under the C.P.I. measure, by contrast, the same couple was officially poor as long as their income remained under $14,095.\u201cThe vast majority of Americans would say that an elderly couple needs more than $14,095 today to have a minimally decent living standard, and I imagine even more would think that $11,300 is far below minimally decent,\u201d Fremstad noted.At the same time, two other poverty researchers, Kathryn Edin, a professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins, and Luke Schaefer, a professor of social work at the University of Michigan, contend that the poverty debate overlooks crucial changes that have taken place within the population of the poor.These changes have produced winners and losers, those who have benefited from two major policy initiatives adopted over the past 20 years, and those who were left behind.According to Edin and Schaefer, the consequence of these changes, taken together, has been to divide the poor who no longer receive welfare into two groups. The first group is made up of those who have gone to work and have qualified for tax credits. Expanded tax credits lifted about 3.2 million children out of poverty in 2013. So far, so good.The second group, though, has really suffered. These are the very poor who are without work, part of a population that is struggling desperately. Edin and Schaefer write that among the losers are an estimated 3.4 million \u201cchildren who over the course of a year live for at least three months under a $2 per person per day threshold.\u201dWhile Edin and Schaefer address the growing advantage the working poor have over nonworkers, Lawrence Mishel, president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute, raises a different set of issues. He agrees with the general finding that \u201cgovernment programs \u2014 transfers and tax subsidies \u2014 have helped lift low incomes, and poverty, correctly measured, has fallen.\u201d But focusing on these findings, Mishel argues, diverts attention from the more serious problem of \u201cthe failure of the labor market to adequately reward low-wage workers.\u201dTo support his case, Mishel points out that hourly pay for those in the bottom fifth grew only 7.7 percent from 1979 to 2007, while productivity grew by 64 percent, and education levels among workers in this quintile substantially improved.The effectiveness of government programs rewarding work, according to Mishel, means that in practice, taxpayers \u201care subsidizing low-wage employers,\u201d who, he wrote, \u201care not putting in enough relative to the publicly provided social safety net.\u201dThe question of how to compare levels of poverty over a half-century remains hotly contested. Jencks argues in his email for consistency:The poverty line was too low in 1964, and it is still too low today. But if you want to measure absolute progress, you can\u2019t move the goal posts just because you think they were set in the wrong place.The measurement of absolute progress is a worthy undertaking, but in terms of evaluating the lived experience of poverty and its detrimental effects, it is equally important, if not more so, to explore the relative progress of the poor. The semi-success of government anti-poverty policy has also marginalized and beaten down millions of people. Without understanding relative poverty \u2014 and in particular the \u201csmall percentage\u201d that falls to the very bottom, almost off the grid \u2014 we haven\u2019t really begun to tackle the problem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Silence Falls on Chicago Trading Pits, a Working-Class Portal Also Closes", "Date": "2015-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 The pits where generations of sweating traders in colorful jackets once bellowed out orders for wheat, corn and cattle contracts, using hand signals and sheer force of personality, are almost empty. The smattering of traders who hung around them on a recent day appeared listless, some glancing at tablet screens, others staring blankly into space.Open-outcry futures trading, a profession that took root here in the mid-19th century, becoming part of the city\u2019s identity and influencing trading systems around the world, is going extinct. Most of the futures pits inside the Chicago Board of Trade building, an Art Deco tower that looms over downtown\u2019s LaSalle Street, are scheduled to close by July after being choked by a decade of technological advancement that has made face-to-face trading largely obsolete.\u201cIt\u2019s a computer product now,\u201d said Anthony Crudele, a 37-year-old trader who started as a clerk in Chicago in the 1990s and was an early adopter of new trading technology. He said the planned closing was inevitable. \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s been closed for many years.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll probably be looked at as outlaws coming in,\u201d said Vincent Provenzano, 55, an options trader who puffed a Dominican cigar in Jack Schwartz Importer, an old-fashioned tobacconist on the ground floor of the Chicago Board of Trade building. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more competitive.\u201dPerhaps even more significant for Chicago is the disappearance of a career path that for over 150 years allowed scrappy teenagers and former high school athletes to hustle their way to wealth, or at least excitement. Futures trading \u2014 as distinguished from options trading, its more cerebral relative \u2014 was for many years a way for those with a blue-collar background to enter the white-collar world.The system for trading futures stayed remarkably consistent. In the pit, traders shouted offers to buy and sell while keeping their eyes and ears open for other offers to jump on before making eye contact with the counterparty and then writing down the trade on a card.But the technological change, when it came, happened quickly. The Merc introduced some electronic futures trading in the 1990s, and the board of trade opened its own system for electronically trading agricultural futures in 2006. As it became faster and often cheaper for institutions to trade online, orders to the pit began to dry up.These days, according to CME, open-outcry trading accounts for just 1 percent of the total trading volume in futures.Mr. Crudele, using a new system for electronically trading S.&P. 500 futures, started working in the early 2000s with Vince D\u2019Agostino, a trader who worked in the pit, to help each other find better prices. (The two of them now run an online trading room, E-Mini Exchange.) But while Mr. Crudele, who had struggled to find his footing in the pit, embraced the new technology, Mr. D\u2019Agostino, 6-foot-4 with an athletic build, was cast in the classic mold.Now 43, Mr. D\u2019Agostino remembers how, as a young child, he played at trading with the cards that his two uncles, both options traders, brought home from the exchange.\u201cYou got multimillionaires and kids that just got out of high school rubbing elbows,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Agostino recalled, sipping a beer at Ceres Cafe in the lobby of the board of trade building. \u201cThey\u2019d say the guys in the pit knew you better than your wife.\u201dCeres, like the Jack Schwartz tobacconist, was once packed wall to wall with traders every day. The barber shop downstairs, Franco\u2019s Hair Salon, would average 20 customers a day in the late 1980s, recalled Franco Calascibetta, the owner, during a long cigarette break in the shop\u2019s back room. Tips could be as high as $50, he said. After one trader lost a fortune in the crash of October 1987, Mr. Calascibetta recalled, he cut his hair for $1 until the trader got back on his feet.\u201cNow the traders are different,\u201d said Mr. Calascibetta, 61, who has an accent from his native Turin, Italy. \u201cThe traders who trade every day on the computer, they don\u2019t know what a tip is.\u201dThe trading floor today can seem as much like a soundstage as a working exchange. Fox Business has a studio there, and Rick Santelli of CNBC broadcasts in front of the pits. In a twist, the options pits, which traders say were hardly ever as raucous as the futures pits, are now the only place on the floor where anything resembling the old level of activity can be found.Some futures traders keep coming to the floor because it\u2019s effectively \u201ccheap office rent,\u201d said Scott Shellady, a prominent trader who wears a jacket printed with spots to resemble a cow. And sometimes customers still send orders there.\u201cYou go back for the people. And you go back to see if there\u2019s something in the pit,\u201d Mr. Crudele said. \u201cYou go back, more or less, because it\u2019s been our home for so long.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Eventually, 20 out of a total of 31 provinces adopted \u201cno safety, no promotion\u201d policies, hitching bureaucrats\u2019 fate to whether they met the death ceiling. The results rolled in: by 2012 recorded accidental deaths had almost halved.It wasn\u2019t, however, all about increased safety. For instance, officials could reduce traffic deaths by keeping victims of severe accidents alive for eight days. They counted as accidental deaths only if the victims died within seven.This is hardly unusual. It is certainly not exclusive to China. These days, in fact, it has acquired particular importance in the debate over how to improve American education.The question is, what will happen when teachers are systematically rewarded, or punished, based to some extent on standardized tests? If we really want our children to learn more, the design of any system must be carefully thought through, to avoid sending incentives astray.\u201cWhen you put a lot of weight on one measure, people will try to do well on that measure,\u201d Jonah Rockoff of Columbia said. \u201cSome things they do will be good, in line with the objectives. Others will amount to cheating or gaming the system.\u201dThe phenomenon is best known as Goodhart\u2019s Law, after the British economist Charles Goodhart. Luis Garicano at the London School of Economics calls it the Heisenberg Principle of incentive design, after the defining uncertainty of quantum physics: A performance metric is only useful as a performance metric as long as it isn\u2019t used as a performance metric.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how big a deal this is,\u201d said Jesse Rothstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has criticized evaluation metrics based on test scores. \u201cIt is one of the main concerns.\u201d\u201cPeople who claim to be market-based reformers want to sell the theory that there is a direct correlation between test scores, the effort of teachers and the success of children,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, who heads the American Federation of Teachers. \u201cIt just ignores everything else that goes into learning.\u201dIn this heated debate, however, it is important not to lose sight of Goodhart\u2019s Law. Most of these studies measured the impact of test scores when tests carried little weight for teachers\u2019 future careers. But what happens when tests determine whether a teacher gets a bonus or keeps his or her job?Education reformers acknowledge the challenge but argue that should not stand in the way of rigorous assessments.Supporters like Mr. Klein point out that value-added scores should not only serve to penalize or reward teachers but also provide feedback to help them improve. Test-based metrics should be leavened with other inputs, from principals, peers and even students. And better tests under the Common Core education standards will lead to better assessments.\u201cIf the evaluation is to have any meaning, it must have stakes,\u201d said James Liebman of Columbia Law School, who served as the chief accountability officer of the New York Education Department under Mr. Klein. \u201cBut the stakes can be inflexible \u2014 like there\u2019s a rigid line after which you\u2019ll fall off \u2014 or flexible, as in, \u2018We\u2019ll see where you compare to others and have a conversation.\u2019 \u201dWill schools sink in a sea of unintended consequences? Professor Rockoff doesn\u2019t think so. He offers one precondition for success: \u201cThe obvious answer is, do not put too much weight on any single measure.\u201dAt the Education Department, officials say the new measures are just about helping teachers and principals improve.Brad Jupp, a special adviser to Secretary Arne Duncan, compares the anxiety about the adoption of new evaluation tools to the uncertainty in the 1940s over what would happen if the sound barrier was broken. Some people thought it would destroy the plane. Others thought the plane would accelerate to a million miles per hour. When Chuck Yeager finally broke it in 1947, neither happened.\u201cThere is this experience of breaking the sound barrier together,\u201d Mr. Jupp said, \u201cthat is valuable for both sides.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of states expected to have fully developed teacher evaluation systems based on student gains on standardized tests, according to the National Council on Teacher Quality. It is 14 more this academic year, not 14 in all.Email: eporter@nytimes.com;\nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Is More Vulnerable in 2016 Than You Think", "Date": "2015-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical CalculusThe general election is a different story. Mrs. Clinton would not cruise to victory, and, yes, she could easily lose.But Mrs. Clinton will not be a Democratic Eisenhower, a popular, senior statesperson who cruises to an easy victory. Her popularity has already faded considerably over the last two years. Her support could erode even further as the campaign unfolds, or as she comes under new scrutiny, be it for foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation, her private email account as secretary of state or new issues.The polls now show her favorability rating beneath 50 percent, making her a fairly typical candidate for the presidency. Her numbers are much more similar to Mr. Obama\u2019s and Mitt Romney\u2019s ratings in late 2012 than her own ratings from two years ago. She has, in other words, gone back to being what Mr. Obama\u2019s supporters alleged in 2008: a polarizing figure, just as Mr. Obama is today.What\u2019s notable about the recent decline in her approval rating is that it has returned to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s apparently natural level of public support.Her ratings started out high as first lady in 1993, as is often the case with that role, but dropped to the mid-40s when she pursued health reform. Her ratings surged during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, but returned to the mid-40s once she ran for Senate, and remained there through her 2008 presidential campaign. Her ratings recovered again after she withdrew from the 2008 race and was no longer active in day-to-day politics.On paper, her strength among these voters is her greatest advantage over Mr. Obama. Perhaps 10 or 15 years ago, Mrs. Clinton could have run a campaign to win these white, Southern conservatives and perhaps carry Arkansas or West Virginia, two states her husband won in both of his presidential elections. But that strategy is untenable in today\u2019s Democratic Party, which will demand a far more liberal candidate than conservative voters are willing to tolerate.None of this is to say that Mrs. Clinton is a weak candidate. Mr. Obama won re-election, after all, despite evolving into a polarizing figure. Her favorability rating is better than that of any of her Republican opponents, who are all poised to become just as polarizing as she. There is a case that she will be a better candidate than she was in 2008, when she was widely caricatured as calculating and unlikable. Many believed that she was already a much stronger candidate by the time the 2008 campaign was over.If Mrs. Clinton does prove to be a particularly adept candidate, given how close the race shapes up to be, it could make a significant difference. But at least for now, her favorability ratings don\u2019t resemble those of an especially strong candidate. The better argument for her strength would be the demographic advantages of today\u2019s Democratic coalition.If the Democrats have such an advantage, then Mrs. Clinton, a person who has engendered great loyalty from many Democratic-leaning voters, may be the candidate best positioned to reassemble that coalition \u2014 particularly under potentially adverse circumstances. And it\u2019s possible that external events, with the economy or foreign affairs, will create those adverse circumstances for the party now in power.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Businesses Respond to Abe\u2019s Push for Higher Wages", "Date": "2015-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere have been repeated public appeals and a series of arm-twisting meetings with executives and union leaders \u2014 reminiscent, some analysts say, of a bygone era when Japanese governments guided the economy with a heavy hand.\u201cWith the usual negotiations between business and labor, executives get stuck in a deflationary mind-set,\u201d Mr. Abe said in Parliament, explaining the government\u2019s decision to become closely involved. \u201cI am counting on this progress to continue.\u201dWages are vital to Mr. Abe\u2019s hopes of reinvigorating Japan\u2019s economy. Household incomes remain roughly where they were 20 years ago. A tentative rise in wages last year was wiped out by increases in inflation and taxes, leaving the average Japanese worse off, and helping to drive the country into recession.But some question whether the size and scope of the promised increases will be enough to create a virtuous cycle of consumer spending and economic expansion. They amount to a modest $25 to $40 a month and apply only to a privileged minority of the work force: full-time workers at the largest corporations.Still, both business and labor groups expressed satisfaction with the outcome, saying they hoped that the pay increases would provide the economy some much-needed momentum.\u201cThe government, our company and the union all want to contribute to putting the economy on a positive growth cycle,\u201d Tatsuro Ueda, a managing officer at Toyota, told reporters at a news conference.Yasunobu Aihara, chairman of the Confederation of Japan Autoworkers\u2019 Unions, said, \u201cWe achieved a bigger increase than last year, so this is an important second step.\u201dThe agreements came at the climax of annual talks between companies and unions that are known here as shunto, or spring battle. The custom \u2014 part seasonal ritual, part hard-bitten negotiation \u2014 has been around since the 1950s, but governments rarely play such a hands-on role.Mr. Abe has been so involved in this year\u2019s process that observers have labeled it \u201ckansei shunto,\u201d or shunto orchestrated by the government. Nobuo Ikeda, a prominent blogger, has called Mr. Abe\u2019s approach \u201cstate socialism.\u201d And some business leaders complain privately that the intervention infringes on their freedom and could endanger their long-term competitiveness by raising the cost of labor.In addition to using his bully pulpit as prime minister to encourage raises, Mr. Abe has dangled the prospect of tax cuts for businesses, linking potential breaks explicitly to cooperation on pay.\u201cIf companies raise wages solidly, and invest in facilities, the Japanese people will gladly accept more tax cuts,\u201d he told a gathering of business leaders in January.Mr. Abe\u2019s policies are a big reason that businesses have more money than usual to distribute to their employees. He took office promising to reverse a rise in the value of the yen that had squeezed profits at companies like Toyota that do much of their business overseas in foreign currencies.The yen has duly plunged, and companies are flush with cash as a result. According to the central bank, corporate cash holdings stood at 231 trillion yen, or about $1.9 trillion, at the end of December, the most on record and a more than 4 percent increase from a year earlier.Now, companies appear to be returning the favor by sharing some of that extra cash.Toyota agreed to lift baseline pay for its full-time Japanese workers by \u00a54,000 a month, the most in 13 years. Added to regular increases linked to seniority, the average Toyota employee\u2019s monthly pay will rise 3.2 percent, the company said, significantly above the rate of inflation.Other large companies announced similar increases in base monthly pay. Nissan agreed to a \u00a55,000 raise. Honda is lifting base pay by \u00a53,400. A group of six prominent electronics makers, including Panasonic, Hitachi and Toshiba, announced raises of \u00a53,000.Economists say pay at companies like Toyota has long served as a benchmark for other businesses; so more of Japan\u2019s large companies are likely to follow in the coming weeks.Many smaller companies, which often serve the domestic market, cannot afford the same level of increases. They have little to gain from the weak currency. Instead, they are getting crimped in the current environment by the rising cost of imported raw materials.The shunto negotiations \u201care basically for large manufacturers, which benefited the most from the yen depreciation,\u201d said Masamichi Adachi, an economist at JPMorgan Chase.The overall effect, though, will move the needle.Naohiko Baba, the chief Japan economist at Goldman Sachs, estimated that basic wages for all workers would rise by an average of 0.5 percent in the fiscal year starting in April, up from 0.2 percent in the current fiscal year.Such increases may be small, but since inflation has slipped back to barely above zero, workers will still feel the benefits, he said.\u201cThe income environment is therefore likely to clearly improve,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Doublespeak in the New Economy", "Date": "2015-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From AmericaWelcome to the neo-Orwellianism of Silicon Valley, where doublespeak flourishes. It issues not from a propagandistic state but from companies that have brilliantly parlayed the novelty of their business models into hall passes shielding them from much of the regulation and scrutiny visited on other companies.In separate rulings this month, a pair of federal judges in California dealt the doublespeak a blow, shredding arguments that Uber and Lyft depend on. The judges also grappled with the problem behind the doublespeak: the rise of a new class of workers who are more than contractors and less than employees. The judges suggested that proper oversight for these workers would require the invention of new rules.The judges, Edward M. Chen and Vince Chhabria, each found that the question of whether the drivers were contractors or employees was murky enough that a jury must decide it. But each judge then went beyond the rulings to ruminate on the strange new fate of the workers.\u201cThe jury in this case will be handed a square peg and asked to choose between two round holes,\u201d Judge Chhabria wrote.Uber and Lyft\u2019s square-pegged workers don\u2019t fit into the round hole of employee because they have no real supervisors, they work irregular hours of their own choosing, and they are free to work for anyone else, too. But they also don\u2019t fit into the hole of independent contractor, like your accountant or neighborhood plumber, because they cannot negotiate their own price, aren\u2019t peripheral to the business (but are central to it), and are subject to extensive control and monitoring.Uber and Lyft have taken the contractor argument to an extreme, arguing not only that drivers are contractors, but that they contract directly with passengers. This view casts the service as \u201can uninterested bystander of sorts, merely furnishing a platform that allows drivers and riders to connect,\u201d as Judge Chhabria framed the argument. He then called this view \u201cobviously wrong\u201d and \u201cnot a serious one.\u201dIn the other case, Judge Chen derided Uber\u2019s claim that it is a technology company selling software, not rides. He likened it to Domino Sugar hypothetically declaring itself \u201ca \u2018technology company\u2019 because it uses modern irrigation techniques to grow its sugar cane.\u201dBut the judges, harsh as they were toward the companies, didn\u2019t side with the drivers, either. Instead, they suggested that the new economy was feeding the courts a problem that existing law cannot digest.What is new about these hybrid workers is that they look a lot like a contractor between gigs, and a lot like an employee during a gig. They may use the company to earn extra spending money, but they may also work for it 50 hours a week as their sole source of bread. They have the right to choose when they work. But when working, they must represent a company\u2019s brand, follow its onerous rules and be subject to its customer ratings and electronic monitoring.A federal judge citing a French philosopher\u2019s book on prisons to explain the lives of its workers: the sharing economy is officially all grown up. Grown-up economies invariably get grown-up rules. Those rules will slowly determine whether the workers of the future get the contractor\u2019s freedom and the employee\u2019s security, or the contractor\u2019s security and the employee\u2019s freedom.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stronger Dollar in a Weak Global Economy", "Date": "2015-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn the last several months, the dollar has strengthened tremendously against other currencies like the euro, the pound and the yen. This largely reflects the realization among investors that the American economy will do much better than other major economies in the coming months.The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are buying lots of bonds to stimulate weak regional economies, but not necessarily to hurt other countries. If they are successful, it will ultimately benefit the entire global economy, including the United States, which is also hurt when the dollar appreciates because that makes American goods more expensive for buyers abroad.The bigger question is whether monetary policy and a depreciating currency can make a significant difference. There is growing evidence that simply increasing the money supply may not be enough to revive weak economies, especially if demand in the rest of the world is not growing quickly enough. Countries cannot export their way to growth if other nations are not in a position to buy their goods and services.For the United States, a stronger dollar will serve to dampen growth, though by how much nobody can accurately predict because the relative values of currencies are hard to forecast. Some American manufacturers have said they are losing orders or seeing their profits decline as they are forced to cut prices to compete with the lower prices offered by European and Japanese businesses. The appreciation of the dollar is a good reason for the Federal Reserve to hold off on raising interest rates this summer. But more than anything else, the stronger dollar serves as a reminder that the world is still far too reliant on the United States, which itself has not yet fully recovered from the financial crisis. That does not augur well for sustainable global growth. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Unlikely to Meet Climate Goal, Study Finds", "Date": "2015-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 The European Union will fail to meet an ambitious goal of significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 unless it takes more aggressive measures to limit the use of fossil fuels and adopts new environmental policies, according to a report scheduled for release on Tuesday.\u201cThe level of ambition of environmental policies currently in place to reduce environmental pressures may not enable Europe to achieve long-term environmental goals, such as the 2050 target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95 percent,\u201d the report said.The report also noted that transportation continues to account for a quarter of all carbon emissions within the European Union, and reducing those by 60 percent by 2050 will require \u201csignificant additional measures.\u201dThe report, which will formally be released on Tuesday, was compiled by the European Environment Agency, based in Copenhagen, and is produced every five years to assess how the Union is progressing toward its environmental goals and to inform European policy. It will be presented to the European Commission and debated in the European Parliament later this month.Hans Bruyninckx, the executive director of the European Environment Agency, characterized the report as an alarming call that provides the 28 European Union member states with a fresh opportunity to set a global example.\u201cAlthough we have colored the outlook red, it doesn\u2019t have to be red,\u201d Mr. Bruyninckx said. He named increased energy efficiency, ecological innovation and improvements to transportation systems as potential areas in which Europeans could adjust their policies to meet their long-term goals.\u201cAlthough we have all of these very different countries with very different energy profiles, in the long run, the commitment to these targets is there, the level of ambition to reach the 80 percent is high on the political agenda,\u201d Mr. Bruyninckx said.Setting global emissions targets, however, has proved elusive for years, and the latest assessment of Europe\u2019s progress illustrates that once targets are reached, significant difficulties remain in holding countries to their agreed-to goals.Even a country like Germany, where support for the environment borders on a religion, has faced unforeseen challenges as it aims to revamp its energy sector from reliance on traditional sources of energy, such as nuclear and fossil fuels, to renewable sources, including wind, solar and biofuels.The race to shutter the country\u2019s nuclear reactors by 2022, for example, has resulted in many power providers using brown coal, or lignite, the cheapest and dirtiest of all fossil fuels to keep the power flowing to customers. This, in turn, has led to an increase in carbon emissions.According to the report, Germany, whose economy is the best in Europe, was the only country with a significant rise in both its emissions reductions and energy consumption last year. Along with Belgium, it is one of only two countries not on track to meet its 2020 targets in either category. According to the German Association of Energy and Water Industries, the country increased its carbon omissions by 20 million tons from 2012 to 2013, instead of reducing them.In order to meet its goals, Germany must reduce emissions annually by 3.5 percent over the next six years, a feat that will result in substantial increases in energy costs, and generate political pressure to block measures that could hurt the economy.Harro van Asselt, a researcher at the Stockholm Environment Institute\u2019s Oxford Centre, said Germany saw a drop in emissions after many polluting industrial sites in the former East Germany were shuttered between the late 1990s and early 2000s. The closings occurred just as Europe began tackling climate change, which assisted the European Union in meeting its 2020 targets, he said.\u201cThe question is not why they might stumble now; the main question is why did they reach their targets before,\u201d Mr. van Asselt said.Now the hard part begins, he said, as the European Union faces the need to undertake more difficult and costly measures in areas like transportation and agriculture to ensure that emissions targets remain on track.\u201cAs long as the European Commission doesn\u2019t undertake more measures in these sectors, they are going to have difficulties in even reaching their goals for 2030,\u201d Mr. van Asselt said.\u201cI think the role of Europe is essential and we have demonstrated that we can make solid multinational agreements that can work,\u201d Mr. Bruyninckx said.An article on Tuesday about a report\u2019s finding that the European Union will fail to meet its goal of significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 unless it takes more aggressive measures erroneously attributed a distinction to Germany. Germany and Belgium \u2014 not just Germany \u2014 are the only countries in the European Union not on track to meet their 2020 targets in emissions.Advertisement"}

The last instance was in 2009, during a global economic slump. In 2014, however, the economy expanded by about 3 percent.\u201cThe numbers I announced are definitely encouraging, but it doesn\u2019t bring us to a happy ending yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to see a happy ending, you want to see an agreement in Paris that will send a powerful signal to investors to go in the direction of low-carbon technologies.\u201dSome energy experts sounded a note of caution about the research, while applauding it. Steven Smith, a senior scientist at the Joint Global Change Research Institute of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, warned that even a two- or three-year shift in emissions \u201cdoesn\u2019t tell you anything,\u201d and that \u201cwhat\u2019s important is the long-term trend.\u201dHal Harvey, who runs a policy research group called Energy Innovation in San Francisco, agreed, saying, \u201cOne year does not a trend make.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cThis is a big deal: China is starting to reverse its carbon trend, as are others. But much more is necessary,\u201d including strong government policies to keep the trend going in the right direction.The renewable energy sector has grown tremendously as costs of the technology have come down and new vehicles have become more fuel-efficient, said Michael B. Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University Law School. The possibility that these shifts could already be affecting overall carbon emissions, he said, \u201cis a welcome splash of light amid all the gloom surrounding climate projections.\u201dFor all of the progress, however, billions of people will be entering the middle class in coming years, noted Steven Cohen, the executive director of the Earth Institute at Columbia. \u201cSome of these early gains are going to be wiped out pretty quickly unless we develop some of the renewable energy sources that can replace fossil fuels,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Etihad Airways\u2019 Rapid Growth Frustrates Rivals", "Date": "2015-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesEtihad flight attendants demonstrate different situations at the airline\u2019s training academy. Each week, up to 100 new trainees graduate from the six-and-a-half-week course.ABU DHABI \u2014 Emerging from the desert like some giant steel squid, the organic forms of Abu Dhabi\u2019s new airport terminal are starting to take shape.The existing airport has become too small for the ambitions of its main tenant, Etihad Airways, the smallest and fastest growing of the three giant Middle Eastern airlines, whose expansion has sown resentment among the legacy carriers of North America and Europe.For more than a decade, the Persian Gulf airlines have transformed international travel, focusing on an obsession with service and single-hub connections. They now fly to more foreign destinations and have more international seats than United States carriers.Now, how Etihad operates \u2014 especially how it is financed \u2014 has become critical in an increasingly contentious battle with airlines and unions in the United States, which accuse Gulf carriers of stealing passengers with the help of generous government support.Etihad is particularly exposed to criticism given how fast it has grown since it was founded in 2004. It now has more than 100 planes and flies to 110 destinations, including S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, Johannesburg and New Delhi. By 2017, the sprawling $3 billion new airport here will have an annual capacity of 30 million passengers \u2014 as much international traffic at New York\u2019s Kennedy Airport today \u2014 mostly driven by Etihad.And increasingly, it is targeting the United States. It has six daily flights to the United States, up from one six years ago, while Emirates Airline and Qatar Airways each fly to nine American cities daily.James Hogan, Etihad\u2019s chief executive, strikes an unapologetic tone. His mandate, he said, is to make money for his shareholder, the government of Abu Dhabi, and be a showcase for its hometown, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\u201cWherever you are in the world, you play to your advantage,\u201d said Mr. Hogan, who is Australian. \u201cWhat are we doing that\u2019s so wrong? We are doing business in a tough environment. We are commercial. We have to be creative. We are giving customers choice.\u201dEtihad and the other Persian Gulf airlines operate the latest-generation airplanes, hire younger flight attendants and offer onboard perks, like bars and showers, that other carriers find frivolous.Some of the service stretches the definition of first class. Etihad, for example, sells a $20,000 one-way ticket that comes with a personal flight attendant it calls a butler, a bedroom and a private bathroom. The airline contends such extravagance \u2014 available on one Airbus A380 now \u2014 signals that anyone capable of such over-the-top luxury for a select few can also improve the lot in the back of the cabin.American carriers, Mr. Hogan said, had not adapted to a globalized economy and were trying to protect their business by blocking competitors.It is a charge American carriers reject. The Persian Gulf airlines, they respond, have received more than $38 billion in government subsidies, according to a 55-page dossier they have shared with government officials in recent weeks but have not made public.Etihad alone received $17 billion in government subsidies in the last 10 years, they say. This includes $6 billion in interest-free loans from the government of Abu Dhabi to buy new planes from Boeing and Airbus, and $6.5 billion to cover operating losses.Etihad\u2019s $640 million sponsorship of Manchester City, an English Premier League soccer club, was also paid by the government on behalf of the airline.\u201cEtihad\u2019s argument fundamentally misunderstands the international consensus on the definition of \u2018subsidy,\u2019 \u201d the report said. \u201cGiven the company\u2019s dismal financial performance over the last 10 years, if not for the subsidies, Etihad would have gone out of business.\u201dEmirates, the biggest and oldest of the three, discloses its financial accounts, uses international auditors and posts regular quarterly profits. Etihad and Qatar Airways, on the other hand, have not opened their books to public scrutiny.Mr. Hogan declined to comment on the accusations raised by his rivals, saying he had not studied them carefully. He acknowledged that the airline had the support of its shareholder, but denied any of that amounted to subsidies. Etihad says it has been profitable since 2011.\u201cLike any new airline, there was seed money and there was shareholder equity,\u201d Mr. Hogan said.It is not the first time that rivals or governments have sought to slow the growth of the Persian Gulf airlines. Restrictions against unlimited service from such carriers exist in Canada, Germany, China and South Korea, said Will Horton, an analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation.But he said the attempt by American carriers to roll back open sky agreements was \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\u201cIf the U.S. carriers can limit growth, that will impact the Gulf carriers,\u201d Mr. Horton said.The calls for limits come after the United States government last year opened a Customs and Border Protection pre-clearance facility in Abu Dhabi for passengers flying into the United States, a move that angered airlines like Delta. The facility was requested by the American government but is financed by Abu Dhabi, including salaries and lodging for the officers.\u201cWe manage Etihad with as much discipline as any U.S. carrier,\u201d said James Mueller, a former United executive, who runs the airline\u2019s sales operations.Other aspects of the carrier\u2019s strategy puzzle outsiders. Etihad has invested in a string of smaller airlines \u2014 including Airberlin and Air Seychelles \u2014 to build its own network of airlines to compete with the world\u2019s three big airline alliances \u2014 Star Alliance, SkyTeam and OneWorld.It paid 560 million euros, or $625 million, for 49 percent of Alitalia and other assets.Mr. Hogan said these partnerships would save money in the long run by making common purchases, and provide bigger network opportunities for all. Etihad had chosen that course, he said, because the major alliances would not enter partnerships with him.Meanwhile, Etihad\u2019s growth shows no sign of slowing. The airline received 250,000 applications for flight attendant jobs last year. Each week, as many as 100 new trainees graduate from the airline\u2019s six-and-a-half-week course.Employees accept the airline\u2019s basic bargain: They work long shifts but are given free housing, and there is no income tax to pay in the U.A.E.Etihad\u2019s hiring policies could be seen as discriminatory in the United States and Europe, where employees are afforded labor protections that are absent in the Persian Gulf countries.During training, new recruits use an automated cabin that can simulate emergencies \u2014 like smoke filling the cabin or crash landings that require a fast response from the crew.Crew members also learn how to sample wines and detect differences among them. Female flight attendants receive guidelines for applying their makeup or pinning their hair.On Etihad\u2019s planes, attention to detail abounds as well. Etihad has three sets of chopsticks, some rounded, some square, some metal, some wood, based on whether the destination is China, South Korea or Japan.Passengers in coach are given pillows that can split open to serve as headrests. Night masks have a red side and a green side. Which one passengers expose indicates whether they want to sleep or be awakened by flight attendants at mealtime. \u201cThere is an advantage of having no legacy,\u201d said Peter Baumgartner, Etihad\u2019s chief commercial officer, adding that the airline can be more creative in its approach to business than traditional carriers.One recent morning, traffic was dense with dozens of flights departing to places like Hyderabad and Chennai, in India; Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Muscat, Oman; and Bangkok. None of those cities are served directly by an American airline out of the United States.Ultimately, Mr. Horton said, Etihad is simply capitalizing on an opportunity. Delta and United do not fly to Abu Dhabi, and each only offers one flight daily to the vibrant commercial and touristic hub of Dubai. American Airlines has none.\u201cIf we look past all the rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Horton said, \u201cat the end of the day what the Gulf carriers do is transport passengers to markets U.S. airlines and their existing partners cannot adequately serve.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about the rapid global expansion of the Abu Dhabi airline Etihad erroneously included a city among those without direct flights from the United States by an American airline. United Airlines recently started thrice-weekly service to Chengdu, China, from San Francisco; it is not the case that no American airline serves Chengdu directly from the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed Knew the Economy Was a Disaster in 2009. Here\u2019s What They Talked About Instead.", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCrisis ModeThe winter of 2009 was the worst, scariest time for the American economy in modern memory. Employers were slashing jobs at a frenetic pace; another major bank failure seemed to lurk around every corner; and the newly installed Obama administration was having a hard time finding its footing to fight the crisis.And at the Federal Reserve, we now know from transcripts of all that year\u2019s monetary policy meetings, there was a great deal of hand-wringing over whether any losses on programs to increase lending would be borne by the Treasury Department or the Fed \u2014 an institution that, as it happens, passes along the money it makes to the Treasury Department, meaning that taxpayers were on the hook either way.That is a recurring theme in 1,600 pages of transcripts released Wednesday: sweating the small stuff when the global economy was burning. Earlier installments of the transcripts showed a committee of policy makers struggling to understand the grave peril facing the domestic economy. But by 2009 virtually the entire committee had a clear understanding of the economic disaster that was underway. That clear understanding just did not always carry over to a sense of great urgency.In fairness, the officials involved were making fast-paced decisions with incomplete information. They were caught in the fog of war, not able to take advantage of five years\u2019 worth of hindsight. (Who among us did not say some things we wish we had not in 2009?) And a few central bank officials did display a combination of sharp economic analysis and a sense of urgency in trying to combat the downturn.But even as the unemployment rate soared by half a percentage point each month early that year, voices urging more aggression to fight the Great Recession were often counterbalanced by fretting over all the possible downsides of their actions.Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, warned in January 2009 about the risk of too much government stimulus, potentially aided and abetted by the Fed\u2019s easy money, \u201cIt strikes me that there is enormous fear in the marketplace about the potential for open-ended stimulus in fiscal policy, and there is great concern that we will acquiesce by monetizing fiscal policy,\u201d he said.Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed, was particularly worried about the possibility that the Fed\u2019s interventions to fight a breakdown in credit markets were distorting the economy and essentially preserving institutions and forms of lending that ought to go the way of buggy whip manufacturers.\u201cPeople make choices on their way to making adjustments,\u201d he said. \u201cWould these leveraged borrowers like there to be a greater demand for their liabilities? Yes. This all looks as though demand is low. I will ask you a question. The buggy whip industry \u2014 is that sector broken?\u201d(What Mr. Lacker did not mention was that this all took place at the same time the domestic auto industry was receiving federal bailouts, and General Motors and Chrysler were at risk of becoming the 21st-century version of buggy whip makers themselves.)In the early months of that year, the Fed pressed ahead with the bold measures it had initiated in 2008 to arrest the financial crisis. By summer it had largely succeeded.And to assuage the fears of many on the committee that the Fed was compromising its treasured independence from political influence, the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, spent a great deal of time discussing with his colleagues an agreement he was working on with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner to codify the relationship between the Fed and Treasury in their crisis response efforts.At one point in the March meeting, Mr. Bernanke seemed to be hoping his colleagues would wind down their questioning about that accord and move on to the real business of the meeting, weighing a vast expansion of the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing efforts to pump money into the moribund economy. \u201cI\u2019m happy to answer as many questions as people want to ask,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said, \u201cbut, again, I also hope to hear something about asset purchases before we close today.\u201dIn isolation, these are all perfectly worthwhile subjects for Fed officials to be weighing and debating. But there is far less in the transcripts that suggest the kind of hair-on-fire urgency to do more to try to help the domestic economy in its darkest hour.What would that sense of urgency look like? As it happens, one member of the committee, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, offered at the March meeting the kind of statement that, knowing what we know now, looks remarkably prescient.\u201cThe economy is just a disaster area,\u201d said Janet L. Yellen, now the chairwoman of the institution. \u201cThe economic outlook is utterly dreadful, and we have said we stand ready to do absolutely everything that\u2019s needed to support the economy. We have let some time pass without doing anything, and in light of the outlook I would want to do everything we can.\u201dIn the early months of that year, the Fed pressed ahead with the bold measures it had initiated in 2008 to arrest the financial crisis.She continued by endorsing the idea of the Fed\u2019s expanding its quantitative easing program to buy Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, calling the idea that the Fed was \u201cmonetizing the debt\u201d a legitimate concern, but dismissing it as not a primary one in the environment of early 2009.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve lost our independence, I think people realize these are unusual and exigent circumstances, and taking a step like that now is a favorable thing for the economy,\u201d she said.She endorsed bond buying and said she was \u201cvery open-minded about magnitudes.\u201dTranslation: Let\u2019s print some money.Almost six years later, the Fed has done exactly that, on a scale that officials undoubtedly never imagined in that winter of 2009. The consequences and ripple effects of those policies will be debated for a long time, but what is absolutely clear is that the United States economy is in much better shape now than it was then.History is likely to treat well the Fed officials who saw the panic of 2008-2009 as a profound economic threat that warranted whatever they could do to stop it.Advertisement"}

Reforms and Human Rights", "Date": "2015-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersRe \u201cUnshackle the United Nations\u201d (Opinion, Feb. 25) by Salil Shetty: Changing the rules of veto power at the Security Council will not fundamentally improve human rights globally. It is primarily the lack of political will and global social solidarity to advance human rights that causes paralysis at the United Nations and its members states, with devastating impacts for human rights and human welfare globally. No simple mechanical change in rules at the United Nations will shift the cold and narrow calculations of national self-interest that inform global politics and policy and undermine human rights.Such a transformation will require a shift in conscience and consciousness, necessitating public education and efforts to challenge and change illiberal social and political norms. This will potentially create greater public pressure on governments to respect human rights without prejudice and delay, and to take reasonable moral action when they are violated to stop mass atrocities and punish their perpetrators.Veto power is not the primary problem. It is merely symptomatic of a more profound moral malice: our indifference to the suffering of distant others.Noam Schimmel, Montreal The writer is a visiting fellow at the McGill Faculty of Law\u2019s Center for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism.Mr. Shetty touches on a crucial point about situations where mass atrocities are being committed or at risk of taking place and suggests that the five permanent members of the Security Council commit to not use their veto power in such cases, thus enabling the Council to protect the lives of civilians in advance, during or in the wake of grave crimes. This is a generous proposal already advanced by France in 2013, but there has been no real progress in its practical promotion. A special, well structured debate about it in the United Nations General Assembly might identify a pragmatic solution for giving tangibility to the French proposal and contributing to the elimination of acts of barbarity in our era of global vulnerabilities.Ioan Voicu, Bangkok The writer is a visiting professor at Assumption University.Turkey\u2019s personality cultRe \u201cTurkey treads a positive path\u201d (Opinion, Feb. 12) by M. Hakan Yavuz and Mujeeb R. Khan: The authors miss the point. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has created a personality cult similar to Gamal Abdel Nasser as well as Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Fidel Castro. Whether it is the sultan, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk or Fethullah Gulen, the personality cult in Turkey prevails over democracy. The Turkish military was removed from decades of power because it failed to produce a personality. The personality cult has power only as long as it can deliver the \u201cgoods.\u201d If it does not deliver, the country descends into chaos because no lawful substitute exists to replace the personality cult except another personality cult. The Turkish economy is declining. Before long, Mr. Erdogan will be unable to deliver.Nicholas G. Karambelas, WashingtonBeware a hasty deal with IranRe \u201cHow to stop an Iranian nuclear breakout\u201d (Opinion, Feb. 27): Robert Einhorn\u2019s conclusions all make perfect sense, until you consider that if Iran was able to conceal its nuclear activities from the international community before, it will probably be able to do it again, and if it can, then accurately gauging a \u201cbreakout time\u201d becomes impossible. By the time the world recognized Iran had broken the deal, we\u2019d be dealing with a nuclear-armed Iran \u2014 and then all of the stated contingencies would be rendered moot.Another issue ignored by Mr. Einhorn is that Iran\u2019s Sunni neighbors are not about to allow themselves to be caught unprepared for this eventuality. They too would soon join the nuclear club, and considering President Obama\u2019s oft-stated goal of nuclear disarmament, the likely arms race sparked by this deal seems counterproductive at best.The real problem is that this agreement is being hastily constructed by an Iranian government with some cash flow issues and an American president seeking a legacy. Any deal worth pursuing would originate from an interest in peace rather than just a desire for sanctions relief or presidential accolades. An end to Iranian hostility, provocation and threats should be the starting point of negotiations, not the distant possible result of giving Iran everything it wants while asking nothing in return.Gary Taustine, New YorkAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Election Result Complicates Life for Clinton", "Date": "2015-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s victory in this week\u2019s Israeli elections has reverberated through American politics, reinforcing Republican faith in the political wisdom of a hawkish foreign policy, worsening his relationship with President Obama, and energizing liberal critics of Israel\u2019s government. But mostly it has complicated the life of Hillary Rodham Clinton.As she moves closer to making her campaign for president official, Mrs. Clinton now faces a deepening polarization among Jewish Democrats over Mr. Netanyahu and how the United States should deal with his government.Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state who has long advocated a two-state solution and once took credit for starting what were then secret talks for an Iran nuclear deal that Mr. Netanyahu vehemently opposes, is now likely to be under increased pressure from her own party to speak up against a government that is openly hostile to Mr. Obama. But if she criticizes Israel, she risks prompting an influential segment of more conservative Jewish Democrats to withhold their support from her presidential campaign, or even to defect to a Republican candidate in 2016.\u201cEveryone is now going to have to pick a side,\u201d said Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, a liberal Jewish lobby that has supported Mr. Obama\u2019s positions on Israel and is hosting its annual conference this weekend. That included the woman at \u201cthe forefront\u201d of the Democratic Party, he said, who would undergo \u201cmore and more pressure.\u201dIn contrast to virtually the entire field of prospective Republican candidates who heaped praise on Mr. Netanyahu, Mrs. Clinton has declined to comment on the Israeli election. Reporters on Thursday were kept away from the car that took her to Atlantic City for a paid speech to the American Camp Association. Last summer she made light of her time as Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cdesignated yeller\u201d at the State Department, a title she earned in part by upbraiding Mr. Netanyahu in 2010 after he announced new settlements during a visit by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Such muscular remarks about the defense of Israel are standard procedure for a Democratic presidential candidate. The overwhelming percentage of Jewish voters, and donors, are liberal and will never vote for a Republican. The progressives who are bothered by Israel\u2019s conservative government care a lot more about other issues, such as the economy and social issues. Support for the government is strong among what people close to Mrs. Clinton estimate to be about a 10 percent sliver of wealthy and influential moderate Democratic Jews for whom Israel is a priority, and could be a reason to withhold their financial backing, if not support a Republican candidate.Still, Jewish elected officials in the Democratic Party describe a nightmare scenario in which traditional supporters of Israel will receive primary challenges from candidates now openly critical of the Israeli government. Polls show that Israel is increasingly unpopular with African-American, Latino and young voters \u2014 a key portion of the Democratic base. Officials fear that an erosion of support for Israel in the party could cause insecurity among Jewish voters, forcing them to seek comfort in the eager embrace of the Republican Party.Donald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention.This is the stuff of dreams for Republicans. For them, and especially the party\u2019s neoconservatives, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s victory was a good omen.\u201cIt will strengthen the hawkish types in the Republican Party,\u201d said William Kristol, the editor of the Weekly Standard, who said that Mr. Netanyahu would win the party\u2019s nomination, if he could run, because \u201cRepublican primary voters are at least as hawkish as the Israeli public.\u201d Would-be candidates responded accordingly.In a statement released after Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s victory, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin congratulated the prime minister on a victory that was \u201cespecially remarkable in light of the Obama administration\u2019s attempts to undermine him.\u201dFormer Gov. Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida paid lip service to the two-state solution, only to argue that its pursuit should be put off. \u201cThe conditions don\u2019t exist right now for that solution to truly take hold,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.Potential candidates appealing to right-wing Jewish Republican megadonors like Sheldon Adelson or a base of conservative evangelicals, many of whom believe Israel has a biblically rooted right to the occupied territories, did not mention the two-state solution. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, for example, praised Mr. Netanyahu for defeating \u201cthe full force of the Obama political team.\u201dAnd he happily exploited the bind in which Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s rejection of the two-state solution and apparent race-baiting on the campaign trail had put Mrs. Clinton.\u201cWhen it comes to Israel, the time for her to stand up is now,\u201d he said, adding that if Mrs. Clinton disagreed with Mr. Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear negotiations, \u201cshe needs to state so clearly and unequivocally right now.\u201dAshley Parker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

(La \u00faltima cifra refleja en parte el creciente n\u00famero de retiros a medida que la poblaci\u00f3n blanca envejece.)Pero bajo una inspecci\u00f3n m\u00e1s cuidadosa, las tendencias que impulsan el mejoramiento del mercado laboral para los hispanos son tendencias que la mayor\u00eda de los esc\u00e9pticos de la inmigraci\u00f3n se\u00f1alar\u00edan.La primera es una recuperaci\u00f3n en la industria de la construcci\u00f3n, lo cual es buena noticia para la econom\u00eda estadounidense en general, porque los empleos en construcci\u00f3n pagan salarios por encima del promedio a los trabajadores poco calificados.El aumento en el empleo hispano refleja una recuperaci\u00f3n cada vez m\u00e1s vigorosa. Los economistas en general dicen que las perspectivas de empleo para los trabajadores poco calificados son m\u00e1s sensibles a los movimientos fluctuantes de la econom\u00eda que las de aquellos con mejores calificaciones, y los hispanos, como grupo, tienden a estar menos educados que los afroamericanos y los blancos.La segunda raz\u00f3n detr\u00e1s del menor desempleo hispano es una pronunciada declinaci\u00f3n en la inmigraci\u00f3n ilegal en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, lo cual ha reducido el n\u00famero de trabajadores que de otro modo habr\u00edan aparecido en las estad\u00edsticas de desempleo del gobierno.A mediados de la d\u00e9cada del 2000, agentes federales estaban deteniendo a m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de migrantes indocumentados al a\u00f1o a lo largo de la frontera. Esa cifra cay\u00f3 en aproximadamente 50 por ciento durante la recesi\u00f3n, luego declin\u00f3 a 340.000 en 2011. El colapso en las detenciones de inmigrantes procedentes de M\u00e9xico, por mucho la mayor fuente de mano de obra indocumentada, fue incluso m\u00e1s pronunciado.La raz\u00f3n para el descenso fue doble, dijo Madeline Zavodny, economista del Agnes Scott College en Decatur, Georgia. Primero, las condiciones econ\u00f3micas en M\u00e9xico estaban mejorando aun cuando el crecimiento en Estados Unidos permanec\u00eda d\u00e9bil, reduciendo un incentivo crucial para emigrar.\u201cEs m\u00e1s costoso en t\u00e9rminos de lo que se tiene que pagar a un coyote, cu\u00e1n lejos tenga uno que ir\u201d, dijo Zavodny.\u201cCuando una compa\u00f1\u00eda pone en claro que est\u00e1 usando E-Verify, toda la fuerza laboral lo sabe\u201d, dijo Pia Orrenius, una economista que estudia la inmigraci\u00f3n en el Banco de la Reserva Federal de Dallas.En conjunto, la historia de los \u00faltimos 10 a\u00f1os es algo as\u00ed: Un auge de la construcci\u00f3n de 2004 a 2007 condujo a un auge correspondiente en el empleo hispano, en el que los inmigrantes obtuvieron 1.6 millones de empleos y los hispanos nacidos en Estados Unidos 800.000, seg\u00fan Pew. El desempleo luego se elev\u00f3 para ambos grupos durante la recesi\u00f3n, y contribuy\u00f3 a un descenso en la inmigraci\u00f3n ilegal. Y como la inmigraci\u00f3n nunca se ha recuperado realmente, el reciente repunte en la construcci\u00f3n est\u00e1 beneficiando principalmente a los trabajadores nacidos en Estados Unidos.Tarde o temprano, por supuesto, la recuperaci\u00f3n empezar\u00e1 a atraer a m\u00e1s trabajadores de Latinoam\u00e9rica. Aunque la inmigraci\u00f3n ilegal sigue estando muy por debajo de su nivel m\u00e1ximo, ha empezado a aumentar de nuevo.Los enfrentamientos entre el Congreso y el presidente quiz\u00e1 sean un juego de suma cero, en el cual un bando gane solo a costa del otro.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Summit,\u2019 by Ed Conway", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.For many people, Bretton Woods stands for that rarest of moments: when governments and experts come together to restore order to a chaotic global economy. After the financial meltdown of 2008, the president of the World Bank and the financier George Soros joined Bill Clinton\u2019s and Tony Blair\u2019s earlier call for a \u201cnew Bretton Woods.\u201d It didn\u2019t happen. The world and especially America may yet come to regret that.To its admirers, many good things were achieved at the Bretton Woods conference over three hectic weeks in the summer of 1944. As the Allies made their final push to liberate Europe, 730 representatives of 44 countries gathered in New Hampshire to set the rules for the postwar economy. Crowded into the half-restored grandeur of a hotel named after nearby Mount Washington, they agreed to create two new institutions to oversee the world economy, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and to establish a managed system of exchange rates.Anchored semi-rigidly to the dollar (which was pegged to the price of gold), this new system was intended to be fairer and more economically rational than the old gold standard, which had collapsed in 1933. It would also be more orderly and sustainable than the endless beggar-thy-neighbor currency devaluations of the subsequent foreign-exchange market free-for-all. In agreeing to this, according to the fans of Bretton Woods, the Allied governments had learned important lessons after World War I, when the determination of the victors to punish the vanquished, rather than rebuild their devastated economies, only added to the pressures that resulted in World War II.\u201cThe Economic Consequences of the Peace,\u201d John Maynard Keynes\u2019s pamphlet pointing out the likely disastrous consequences of the victor-friendly policies adopted after World War I, had turned Keynes into the century\u2019s first celebrity economist. At Bretton Woods, he led the British delegation. He was the dominant intellectual force at the conference, though that did not stop him from losing many of the crucial political battles to his American counterpart, Harry Dexter White. A Jew from a rough part of Boston with a dislike for British elitism, White was later accused of spying for the Soviets, but only after he had won some notable victories over the Cambridge don.The battle between Keynes and White provides much of the color in \u201cThe Summit,\u201d Ed Conway\u2019s entertaining and insightful history. \u201cThey were the odd couple of international economics,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe pair would shout at each other in meetings, bully each other in an attempt to get their way and, afterwards, abuse their rival to their friends.\u201d There may not be much new in this account, but the general reader will love how Conway, an economics journalist, skillfully brings to life the goings-on in what the British snobbily called the \u201cmonstrous monkey house\u201d of Bretton Woods.Comprising Colombians and Chinese, Ethiopians and Russians, this was, Conway writes, \u201cquite possibly the most cosmopolitan gathering ever seen in that part of New England.\u201d It was a chaotic fusion of summer camp and labor camp (the British called their rooms the \u201csalt mines\u201d). The delegates worked hard and partied harder. Early on, Keynes said it was \u201cprobable that acute alcoholic poisoning would set in before the end.\u201d The leading Chinese delegate, H.\u2009H. \u201cDaddy\u201d Kung, made it his goal to throw the most extravagant party. Many delegations, the Soviets above all, brought along bevies of beautiful women, not, it seems, for the typing and translation for which they were ostensibly employed.One committee of delegates took a 15-minute recess in the bar each night at 1:30 to watch the \u201ctitillating gyrations of Conchita the Peruvian Bombshell.\u201d Afterward, reinvigorated, they would negotiate for another hour or so. The long arguments left White increasingly short-\u00adtempered on less than five hours of sleep a night. Keynes, already weakened by the heart disease that would kill him within two years, was soon holding court from his bed, tended (and guarded) by Lydia, his eccentric Russian ballerina wife. At one point, a rumor spread that he was near death; when he then appeared at dinner, the delegates spontaneously stood and sang \u201cFor He\u2019s a Jolly Good Fellow.\u201d Yet for all this hard work, the negotiations were barely concluded by the deadline. Most delegates signed the final document without having time to read it.Keynes did not get much of what he wanted, largely because he was playing with a lousy hand. He who has the money calls the tune. Britain, on the verge of bankruptcy because of the cost of the war, was desperate to be bailed out by its wealthy creditor, America. (Were he alive today, perhaps Keynes would be negotiating for Greece to get a better deal from its eurozone creditors.) Keynes could not prevent both the I.M.F. and World Bank from being headquartered in America, nor strict limits from being placed on the ability of the newly created institutions to be generous to debtor nations like Britain. And White made sure, with some unexpected help from a British official acting against the wishes of Keynes, that the dollar became the reserve currency anchoring the new exchange-rate regime.Was White waging this battle not as a representative of the United States but as an agent of Soviet intelligence? Conway gives him as much benefit of the doubt as is possible given evidence that by 1997 was strong enough to convince Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. \u201cThough his involvement with the Russians undoubtedly looks shady from certain angles,\u201d Conway says equivocally, \u201cthe reality is that we shall never know for certain whether White knowingly betrayed his country.\u201d Well, maybe.By the time of the inaugural meeting of the I.M.F. in Savannah, Ga., in March 1946, both White and Keynes were losing faith in what they had created. Suspicions of spying may have cost White the top job at the fund. Keynes felt that the ability of the new institutions to provide the money needed to revive the global economy had been wrongly constrained. (Indeed, it took a later initiative financed with American money, the Marshall Plan, to get Europe back on its feet.) Nonetheless, the Bretton Woods system contributed to unusually strong and steady postwar growth in the world economy, and the twin institutions it created remain an influential legacy. Not all of it was built to last, however. The managed exchange-rate mechanism was falling apart long before Richard Nixon condemned it to death in August 1971 by devaluing the dollar and ending the remaining link between currencies and the price of gold.There are many important lessons for today from all this, not least that having the smartest person in the room on your side is no guarantee of success. It highlights how the fall of an old superpower and the rise of a new one can impose huge strains on the global economy. Today, America is the old power that is having to learn what it is like to play a game in which others are catching up fast, and yet it continues to control the global reserve currency as if we were still in 1944. How serious China was in 2009 when it proposed the establishment of a new global reserve currency is unclear. Yet, one way or another, as China rises the power of the dollar will diminish and some more China-centric alternative will arise. Similarly, the recent grumbling from developing countries about America\u2019s dominance of the I.M.F. and World Bank will only get louder. Bretton Woods was far from perfect, but it was a noble effort. It produced a remarkable degree of agreement among a large number of countries that surely contributed to the rapid recovery of the global economy after World War II, and perhaps helped avoid a World War III. Such international agreements are few and far between, and usually possible only when a shared calamity leads statesmen to set aside for a while some short-term national interests. Perhaps in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash, a similar global solution could have been found that would have contained some of the pressures now growing in the global economy. But that moment is gone, and absent a Keynes and White of our own, we are left to muddle through. THE SUMMITBretton Woods, 1944: J. M.

{"Headline": "Obama Praises Affordable Care Act on Its 5th Birthday", "Date": "2015-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama marked the fifth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act by mocking the law\u2019s longtime critics as wrong about their predictions that its passage would doom America\u2019s health care system.In an event at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Obama said the law had decreased the ranks of the uninsured by a third, having enabled 16 million people to sign up for health coverage through the government marketplaces.\u201dWe have been promised a lot of things in these past five years that didn\u2019t turn out to be the case,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cDeath panels, doom, a serious alternative from Republicans in Congress.\u201dThe president\u2019s remarks came as the law remained under attack on multiple fronts.

Short, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, issued a statement shortly after Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks.\u201cNo matter how much President Obama spins his unpopular health care law so Hillary Clinton can run for his third term, middle class Americans are still being saddled with higher premiums, higher taxes, fewer work hours, and canceled plans,\u201d Mr. Short said.For Mr. Obama, the attacks may become easier to deflect, given the statistics that he cited at the event on Wednesday. He said that health care premiums would be $1,800 higher now if price growth in that industry had continued at the rate of five years ago. He said that cuts in Medicare drug costs had saved seniors $15 billion.\u201dIt\u2019s working, despite countless attempts to repeal, undermine, defund and defame this law,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\u201cIt\u2019s not the job killer that critics have warned about for five years,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWhen this law was passed, our businesses began the longest streak of private sector job growth on record. Sixty straight months. Five straight years. Twelve million new jobs.\u201dRepublicans insist that the economy would have been even better without the health care law. But after years in which the White House was on the defensive \u2014 especially when it came to the rocky implementation of the law \u2014 Mr. Obama on Wednesday was ready to simply brag about it.\u201dWe know beyond a shred of a doubt that the policy works,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want to Save on Car Rentals? Go Low-Tech", "Date": "2015-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal TravelerWant to save on your next car rental? You may have to tear yourself away from the Internet and do the unthinkable: make a few phone calls.Sites like Kayak, Priceline and TripAdvisor have been a boon for frugal travelers. But they also foster a potentially costly illusion: that all bargains are a click or tap away. As I discovered after some obsessive searching for car rental deals, low-tech and no-tech strategies can sometimes be as helpful as the latest online innovations.I started my hunt \u2014 for a two-day weekend rental on a trip to Vancouver scheduled two weeks away \u2014 with the usual suspects, the major aggregators and booking sites. Kayak, Expedia, Carrentals.com, Rentalcars.com and the blind-booking site Hotwire all turned up similar rates for an economy rental from the airport. I found that big variations in price on the low end of the market are rare \u2014 and it turns out there is a reason for that: industry consolidation.\u201cHertz, Avis Budget Group and Enterprise now control 95 percent of the domestic market through their various brands,\u201d said Neil Abrams, president of Abrams Consulting, which specializes in the car rental industry. \u201cThese companies are ultracompetitive among themselves.\u201d Kayak found me the best deal by a slim margin, $13.15 a day from Enterprise, a price that included unlimited mileage, taxes and fees but not additional charges like insurance.So I booked. Unlike a flight or hotel reservation, this was just the beginning. Car bookings can generally be canceled anytime up to the instant you step to the counter and pay. (Hotwire is one prominent exception.) \u201cThis is one of the biggest advantages consumers have,\u201d Mr. Abrams said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no downside to locking in a good price with a reservation.\u201d (A quick aside for renters without a booking who have, say, just landed at the airport: Firing up a mobile app from Carrentals.com, Priceline or another aggregator will often turn up rates far lower than what you would get quoted just walking up to the counter.)Now it was time to beat the rate I found in 30 seconds. Granted, it seemed pretty low already, but how hard could it be?Bleary eyed, with my browser freezing up from too many open tabs, I was beginning to get discouraged when I got an email from AutoSlash with the subject line \u201cGreat News!\u201d Their tireless bots had tracked down a reservation with Hertz for just $10.01 a day, nearly a 25 percent discount over my original rate. In this instance, that worked out to a measly $3 a day savings; but at peak times of the year when rates were higher, or for a longer-term rental, my savings could have been substantial. More important, I had something to show for a day of Internet sleuthing. I clicked through to the AutoSlash site and booked.But I knew I was still missing a big piece of the puzzle: insurance. The loss-damage waiver alone at Hertz, indemnifying me in the event I smashed up the car, would cost $29 a day, about triple the price of the car rental. The frugal traveler in me was pretty sure I was already protected under my own auto insurance plan and maybe my credit card, as well. The responsible adult who would be on the hook wasn\u2019t as confident.\u201cPeople wait until they get to the counter to think of these things, then they either buy too much insurance or none it all,\u201d said Jeanne Salvatore, chief communications officer for the nonprofit Insurance Information Institute. \u201cGenerally, whatever insurance you have on your personal car applies when you rent a car, provided the rental isn\u2019t for business purposes. But the easiest way to find out is to make a few calls.\u201dSo, I pried my fingers from the keyboard and did just that. To my surprise, and relief, I learned from my insurance agent that I was fully covered for car rentals: I could comfortably decline the loss-damage waiver, as well as any supplemental liability insurance (protecting me if I hurt other people and they sued me for more than the minimal liability coverage that often comes with the rental car), personal accident protection (should I get injured and have medical expenses) and personal effects coverage (in case my stuff gets stolen).Final tally: One five-minute phone call saved me at least $58 in insurance charges; a full day staring at search and discount sites saved about $6. For compulsively frugal travelers, there may be a lesson here: In an era when online bargain hunting is easier than ever, finding the best savings may require going offline.More low- and no-tech tips from the pros:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ukraine Tells Bondholders to Expect Some Losses", "Date": "2015-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoscow \u2014 Holders of Ukrainian bonds, already beleaguered by the last year of war and upheaval in that country, should expect to lose some of their principal in negotiations with the government, Ukraine\u2019s finance minister said Tuesday.Bondholders including the country\u2019s largest single creditor, the investment fund Franklin Templeton, which is based in San Mateo, Calif., have been holding out for an agreement to extend the bonds\u2019 maturities but not write off principal.Some form of restructuring, though, was inevitable after Ukraine\u2019s security and economic situation unraveled over the last year and a requirement was written into an International Monetary Fund bailout that private sector creditors take some losses.Natalia A. Jaresko, the finance minister, met privately with more than a dozen of the largest creditors from the United States and Britain in recent days, before warning on Tuesday in a series of interviews in London that creditors should not \u201chold out\u201d against a settlement.After all, the I.M.F. made its offer of $17.5 billion in assistance to Ukraine, which desperately needed the money to prosecute the war and keep the economy afloat, contingent on Kiev persuading private creditors to accept $15.3 billion in write-offs or deferred payments over four years. Under the deal, Western governments will extend an additional $7.5 billion in bilateral loans or loan guarantees, bringing the total bailout package to about $40 billion.The private creditors say Ukraine could meet that requirement by extending the maturities on the bonds and delaying interest payments.The economy could worsen unpredictably because of the war, and the Greek bailout hardly put that country on a path to sustainably repay its debt.\u201cJust maturity extension does not get us within the three goals that we agreed to with the I.M.F.; it doesn\u2019t get us to the level of debt sustainability that I think we need,\u201d Ms. Jaresko said, according to Reuters.On her tour of creditors, Ms. Jaresko met the top 15 bondholders except the second-largest creditor, the National Wellbeing Fund, a Russian sovereign wealth fund.The Russians bought about $3 billion in bonds in December 2013 in the final months of the government of Viktor F. Yanukovych, after Mr. Yanukovych rejected a European trade deal and I.M.F. aid package. It was that decision that initiated a street protest movement against him and ultimately ushered in the new government, which inherited the debt.Even as the Ukraine crisis escalated, Franklin Templeton and other bondholders continued to bulk up on the country\u2019s bonds, betting on either a Western or Russian bailout. All these bets eventually went bad as Ukraine sank into deeper turmoil.Ukrainian government bonds have lost more than half their value. But Franklin Templeton and the Russian government fund have both rejected a principal reduction and expect to be repaid.Private-sector creditors have little leverage in Ukraine, given the clear support for the government\u2019s position within the I.M.F. and in Western capitals.They could align with Russia and force Ukraine into a destabilizing default that would raise borrowing costs for years and discourage foreign direct investment, undermining some of the expected benefits of the European trade deal that was central to last year\u2019s protests.One creditor, a fund manager, suggested that if Ukraine offered more amenable conditions to the private-sector lenders, they could ease a process of removing cross-default clauses in the bond agreements, allowing Kiev to negotiate the Russian debt separately.The fund manager, who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the negotiations, said bondholders were disappointed in the I.M.F. for expecting private investors to take such a large loss while governments that had so vocally backed Ukraine were contributing less. The expected government loans in the bailout from the United States, European nations and others of $7.5 billion come to about half the $15.3 billion in losses over four years that bondholders are being asked to accept.\u201cIt\u2019s a little ironic that the I.M.F. put together this $40 billion package,\u201d the manager said in a phone interview, \u201cand then more than a third of it is not really public aid, but private sector aid.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egypt\u2019s Leader Showcases Plans for Growth", "Date": "2015-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt \u2014 President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi knows how to haggle, if he does say so himself.An executive from General Electric recently told him that it would take at least 24 months to finish a utilities project, but Mr. Sisi demanded just eight, he boasted Sunday in a televised address.When he heard the company\u2019s price, he exclaimed, \u201cFor God\u2019s sake!\u201d Mr. Sisi continued, asserting he had talked the prices down until the executive pleaded that General Electric could reduce its cost no further \u2014 and even then, Mr. Sisi said, he had squeezed out a little more.\u201cI said, \u2018Please, again, let\u2019s remove this 100 million,\u2019 and he did! General Electric did!\u201d Mr. Sisi declared, to rapturous applause in a packed conference room here.His tales of his negotiating prowess, which could not be confirmed, are in many ways emblematic of his efforts to turn around Egypt\u2019s sputtering economy: energetic and well publicized, centered on top-down direction from his own office, and with results that remain to be seen.Four years after a popular uprising forced out President Hosni Mubarak \u2014 and 20 months since Mr. Sisi assumed power in a military takeover \u2014 Mr. Sisi knows he needs to act fast, said Richard Shediac, a managing director of the consulting company Strategy&, formerly known as Booz & Company. His firm was hired by the United Arab Emirates, a major financial backer of Mr. Sisi\u2019s government, to help advise him on overhauling the economy.\u201cThe window for the president and Egypt to show change is not long, and he sees that,\u201d Mr. Shediac said in an interview here. \u201cI think he has a couple of years to show that he has made change happen, or we risk going back to noise from key constituencies.\u201dMr. Sisi spoke at the end of a three-day development conference here that he has made a centerpiece of his economic program. The conference was intended to showcase his promises of investor-friendly reforms, but it also included some reminders of his government\u2019s continued dependence on the Persian Gulf monarchies that backed his ouster of President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates each pledged $4 billion in aid, adding to a total of more than $20 billion they had contributed after the takeover.Egyptian state television and other networks filled the weekend with broadcasts of its sessions. Panel discussions and speeches were sometimes interrupted with chants of Mr. Sisi\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cLong Live Egypt,\u201d or, in English, \u201cGo, Egypt!\u201d Ibrahim Mahlab, Mr. Sisi\u2019s prime minister, even shed a few tears in the conference\u2019s closing moments, apparently overcome by emotion, and an aide rushed forward with a handkerchief to wipe away his tears.To impress foreign visitors, the provincial government even issued every taxi driver a dark business suit, several drivers said, and two said they were warned of a financial penalty if they wore more casual clothes during the conference. But amid all the cheerleading, some businessmen complained that the government had still done too little to prune back a bloated bureaucracy, unaffordable subsidies and burdensome regulations that have drained its coffers and deterred investment.\u201cNew ministers are stuck with old baggage,\u201d Naguib Sawiris, a telecommunications mogul who is one of Egypt\u2019s richest men, told the investment minister, Ashraf Salman, in one panel discussion. \u201cThey should have fired all the people from the past,\u201d calling them \u201cslow, inefficient and unable to get anything done.\u201dWhen the minister began to extol steps taken in the past seven months, Mr. Sawiris shot back, \u201cIn the private sector, their seven months is just a day for us.\u201dEconomists fault Mr. Sisi for seeking to stimulate growth primarily through state-sponsored \u201cmega-projects\u201d like a plan to dig a new channel for the Suez. Housing Minister Mostafa Madbouly unveiled a plan for a new \u201cadministrative capital,\u201d to be built from scratch just east of Cairo. An initial \u201ccenter city,\u201d he said, would be complete in less than seven years and would include a presidential palace, a diplomatic district, as well as malls, universities and skyscrapers in an urban area that would ultimately be \u201c12 times the size of Manhattan.\u201dBut the financing and details remain to be seen.Ragui Assaad, an economist affiliated with the Economic Research Forum in Cairo and the University of Minnesota, said that so far he would give Mr. Sisi\u2019s program about \u201ca B-.\u201d\u201cHe is just looking for silver bullets that will restart the economy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is only going to generate short-term economic activity unless you change the rules.\u201dAfter the 2011 uprising, Egypt fell as much as $7 billion behind in its payments to international energy companies that pump its oil and gas, leading many to halt new investment or even some maintenance. But the new government has paid down those debts, and BP Group recently announced plans to invest as much as $12 billion over several years to develop gas reserves in the West Nile Delta.Mr. Sisi, meanwhile, spent the conference surrounded by burly guards, meeting with diplomats, Arab royals and businessmen.Joe Kaeser, chief executive of the German company Seimens, announced a $4.2 billion contract to build a power plant and a wind-power field, saying that talks had begun three weeks ago with a visit to Mr. Sisi\u2019s office. \u201cIn my long career, I think that was the first deal I ever negotiated with a president,\u201d he said.Mr. Sisi, for his part, bragged that he had successfully bargained down Mr. Kaeser\u2019s price as well. \u201cKindly reduce your profit margin; I need this from you!\u201d Mr. Sisi said he told Mr. Kaeser. And he complied, the president insisted.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall St. Bonuses Rose Just 2% in 2014", "Date": "2015-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street bonuses just aren\u2019t what they used to be.The sluggish growth reflects the challenges still facing Wall Street, including choppy markets and new regulations that have reined in profit to some extent. The industry added 2,300 jobs in the city in 2014, after two years of job losses, but the number of jobs in the sector is still much smaller than before the 2008 financial crisis.This economic engine, however, has not exactly been humming. The number of jobs on Wall Street last year, 167,800, remains below the level of 188,300 in 2007, according to the latest report. While much of the city has bounced back from the recession, Wall Street \u2014 traditionally a major driver of economic recoveries \u2014 has not led the way.Mr. DiNapoli struck an optimistic note on Wednesday, pointing to the 1.4 percent gain in jobs in 2014, though he tempered his remarks with caution.\u201cMaybe we\u2019re seeing a delayed resurgence on the Street that will contribute to the economic recovery,\u201d he said. But he added that it \u201cremains to be seen whether this trend can and will be sustained in the coming year.\u201dBonuses are a closely watched barometer of Wall Street\u2019s health, often rising in good times and falling when revenue is tight. In 2013, the average bonus rose 19 percent, to $169,850, from the previous year, according to a revised estimate by the comptroller on Wednesday.Still, the year-to-year fluctuations of bonuses are also influenced by somewhat arcane factors, like the widely used policy of deferring a portion of compensation. The 2013 figures included an unspecified amount of pay that had been awarded in earlier years, making bonuses appear larger.Similarly, the numbers for 2014 do not include compensation that was awarded for that year but not yet paid out. The data also fails to capture stock options.Wall Street\u2019s profits have declined for two consecutive years, Mr. DiNapoli\u2019s office found. The total profits for the industry \u2014 defined as the broker-dealer operations of firms that are members of the New York Stock Exchange \u2014 totaled $16 billion in 2014, a 4.5 percent decline from 2013.That\u2019s a far cry from 2009, when the industry\u2019s profit, not adjusted for inflation, was more than $60 billion, according to the comptroller\u2019s office.Wall Street\u2019s overall bonus pool for 2014 grew slightly faster than individual bonuses measured on average. Mr. DiNapoli\u2019s office found that the 2014 bonus pool rose 3 percent, to $28.5 billion, from the previous year. (The discrepancy between the two metrics was a result of the fact that a larger number of employees shared in the 2014 bonus pool than in the 2013 one.)Despite Wall Street\u2019s importance to the state and city economies, the average New Yorker probably won\u2019t be shedding any tears over the slow growth in bonuses.Mr. DiNapoli said that in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available, the total compensation for an average Wall Street employee was about five times as high as that for workers in the rest of the city\u2019s private sector.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Major British Parties Struggle to Fend Off Challenges as Campaigns Begin", "Date": "2015-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe heat of the election masks what appears to be a major change in British politics. All the pollsters and analysts suggest that Britain is on course for the first consecutive coalition governments since the early 1900s, or for a weak minority government that can command a majority in the House of Commons only with the support of minor or regional parties.That is the expected result. But it remains quite uncertain whether the Conservative Party or the Labour Party will win the most seats and produce the next prime minister.Both main parties are appealing to their base supporters and trying to fend off challenges from smaller regional and fringe parties. Those groups include the Scottish National Party, which could deny Labour a victory by winning the majority of Labour-held seats in Scotland, and the U.K. Independence Party, which could do the same to the Conservatives by taking away votes in marginal constituencies.Smaller parties \u2014 the Scottish and Welsh nationalists, the Democratic Unionists in Northern Ireland, the Greens and UKIP \u2014 could hold the balance of power in the next Parliament, making government policy subject to negotiation, no matter the ringing tones and policy promises of the main party platforms.On Monday, the leaders made the rounds, with the prime minister, David Cameron of the Conservative Party, making a formal visit to Queen Elizabeth II, and his deputy, Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats, doing the same as head of the Privy Council. But, this time, the visits were not to ask the queen\u2019s permission because Britain\u2019s is a fixed-term Parliament, and Election Day, May 7, has been on the calendar for years.The coalition government is judged to have worked well, but politically it seems to have damaged both parties. This is especially true for the Liberal Democrats, who are traditionally the middle-of-the-road choice for those opposed to the two main parties.But while either Mr. Cameron or the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, will end up as prime minister after the election, both main parties have lost many of their traditional voters in a more fragmented polity. Britons no longer vote so much by traditional class and family loyalties, and both main parties have turned away from the center.Mr. Miliband, who owes his leadership to the trade unions, has criticized the broader, centrist group Labour became under former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Mr. Cameron has pushed further right, calling for more budget cuts, debt reduction and tightened controls on immigration, and promising a referendum on Britain\u2019s continued membership in the European Union.Mr. Miliband is arguing that the Conservatives have favored the rich and he promises less inequality, with higher pay for the working poor, still higher investment in the National Health Service and steeper taxes on the wealthy. Labour is arguing that tough budget cutting is not necessary, that deficit reduction can be much more gradual in a low-interest world. It promises only to have a balanced budget, not counting loans for investment in infrastructure, by the end of the next Parliament in 2020.Mr. Miliband argues that for many voters, the economic recovery \u201cfeels like it\u2019s happening to someone else, somewhere else.\u201d He began his campaign on Monday by trying to reassure a skeptical business community. While business leaders generally favor the Tories, they are not happy with Mr. Cameron\u2019s promise of an in-or-out referendum on British membership in the European Union in 2017.On Monday, Labour took out a full-page ad in the business-friendly Financial Times rejecting any such referendum, saying, \u201cThe biggest threat to British business is the threat of an E.U. exit,\u201d adding, \u201cLabour will put the national interest first.\u201dMr. Miliband is still regarded by the British as something less than prime ministerial material and is touched by \u201cthe mark of Cain.\u201d That\u2019s because he challenged his older brother, David, a more centrist former foreign minister, for the Labour leadership, and narrowly beat him.But Ed Miliband is also considered resilient and sincere, and while Mr. Cameron is considered a better leader and more competent to run the economy, he also has a reputation for offhandedness and entitlement, and many in his own party think he is too soft on Europe. But Mr. Cameron is more popular than his party, polls say.On Sunday, Mr. Cameron said at a party rally that the election \u201ccan only be cut two ways: Conservative or Labour.\u201d On Monday, returning from Buckingham Palace, Mr. Cameron said that a Labour victory would bring \u201ceconomic chaos\u201d and warned, \u201cDebt will rise and jobs will be lost as a result.\u201d His campaign strategist, Lynton Crosby, has told Tories to stick to the economy.Mr. Cameron was then attacked for being presumptuous about winning a second term and for being na\u00efve about Tory politics \u2014 even if he becomes prime minister again, he will immediately be seen as a lame duck and rivals will maneuver in earnest to replace him.Mr. Cameron also did less well than expected in a TV interview with Jeremy Paxman, a journalist known for his aggressive, persistent questioning. Under the same pressure, Mr. Miliband is considered to have done better, at one point saying, \u201cYou\u2019re important, Jeremy, but not that important.\u201dSome polls showed an immediate boost for Mr. Miliband, who also said that he had shown his \u201ctoughness\u201d by \u201cstanding up to the leader of the free world,\u201d President Obama, over Syria.But as usual in British elections, issues of defense and foreign policy are marginal compared to the state of the economy, education and the future of the National Health Service.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of one of the regional parties. It is the Scottish National Party, not the Scottish Nationalist Party.Advertisement"}

Most small businesses, 92 percent, do not use E-Verify. If these businesses do not comply, they would face significant financial penalties.H.R. 1147 would cost employers $2.6 billion to implement, according to data from Bloomberg, and would increase the federal deficit by $30 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bill would devastate the agricultural industry, since close to 75 percent of seasonal fieldworkers are undocumented.E-Verify would also harm workers. An independent study found that lawful permanent residents were four times more likely \u2014 and work-authorized immigrants were 27 times more likely \u2014 to receive an erroneous E-Verify determination.Furthermore, there is no administrative appeal system in place if a worker receives an erroneous E-Verify determination. Under H.R. 1147, the only recourse a worker has is to hire a lawyer and sue an employer under the Federal Tort Claims Act.E-Verify would harm employers, workers and the economy. A humane immigration policy that recognizes the labor rights of all workers is the way forward.GABRIEL CAMACHOImmigration Programs CoordinatorAmerican Friends Service CommitteeCambridge, Mass.To the Editor:The proposal by a former senator and a former representative to mandate E-Verify as a bipartisan step toward immigration reform overlooks the structural flaws of comparable programs, past and present. They argue that E-Verify, currently voluntary, could be expanded to require all employers to submit and verify worker information online, in order to exclude undocumented immigrants from the work force and discourage newcomers.The laws that already exist to prohibit employment of undocumented immigrants are underenforced and abused. Employers nationwide hire illegal immigrants off the books to undercut workers with visas, who require the minimum wage and benefits.The H-2 program allows employers with labor shortages to bring in temporary foreign workers, but is sidestepped with little consequence by employers unable or unwilling to pay $7.25 an hour. E-Verify will not prevent this abuse.The proposal is more valid as a potential opportunity for bipartisan consensus than as an actual solution to unjust, unrealistic immigration policy.KERRY MARTINBurlington, Vt.

After all, it isn\u2019t sci-fi when Stephen Hawking says things like, \u201cThe development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.\u201dThe result is that we\u2019re looking at fewer jobs that pay the equivalent of what an autoworker or a teacher made in the \u201960s and \u201970s. All but a lucky few will either have the kind of service jobs that are now paying around $9 an hour, or be worse off.Welcome to the Brave New World, one featuring even fewer haves and more have-nots than the current one. The winners and losers are the same, but the polarity is even more extreme.And although this is morally detestable, as Robert B. Reich, the former secretary of labor and current professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told me a couple of weeks ago, it\u2019s also \u201ca crass economic issue. Because as you have more and more people who are getting paid relatively little, the question in most economic heads is, where is the aggregate demand going to come from?\u201d If no one can buy, there\u2019s very little to sell; again, relative to their income, rich people don\u2019t buy much. (A hundred million people with $100 each spend a lot more than one person with $10 billion.) Those unable to get those jobs \u2014 and, given that one in six Americans qualifies for food stamps, it\u2019s clear that there isn\u2019t enough good work to go around \u2014 can survive only if income distribution is addressed. One way to do this is through the earned-income tax credit, a kind of reverse income tax, similar to Milton Friedman\u2019s proposal and therefore acceptable to many Republicans.The historian and economist Gar Alperovitz, who details these efforts in his book \u201cWhat Then Must We Do?\u201d (a Tolstoy quote about, essentially, inequality), recently said to me, \u201cThe political game is beginning to resemble a checkerboard strategy: Some of the squares on the board are clearly blocked, but others are open. The goal, of course, is to expand the number of squares that are receptive to democratization efforts \u2014 not just to restore economic health and sustainability in struggling communities, but to demonstrate viable alternatives.\u201dNONE of this is short term, but neither are the robots taking over tomorrow, and it\u2019s safe to say that nearly all the humans on Earth 20 years from now would prefer an economic system that would guarantee a decent life, whether their \u201crulers\u201d are heartless robots or merely gazillionaires. We just need to do short-term work with a long view, and remember that few predicted the great changes of our time: the civil rights movement, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Arab Spring. Nineteen years ago, Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, which allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages blessed by other states \u2014 and look what\u2019s happened since.Between the recession (which is only over if you were making real money to begin with) and the crushing of our spirits by death-ray-wielding, 40-foot-high titanium monsters, perhaps there\u2019s time to reimagine society. And why not? We need equally big thinkers now, and dreamers, and we need to be acting with them.We have achieved a level of social equality barely imagined by progressives 50 years ago, but economic equality has gotten much worse.

In the long run we know that we\u2019ll make the transition from capitalism to some less destructive and hopefully more just system. Why not begin that transition now?

{"Headline": "Can Washington\u2019s Gift Economy in Marijuana Work?", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGrow and GiveIt sounds like an idea a stoner might come up with.In Washington, D.C., it\u2019s now legal to possess marijuana, to grow it, to smoke it and to give it away. But you\u2019re not allowed to trade in it. You can give your neighbor up to an ounce, but if he gives you money or even bakes you a pie in exchange, that\u2019s illegal.Drug prohibition imposes many costs. People go to jail for using and trading in drugs, causing major disruption to individuals\u2019 lives and to communities. Illegal markets breed crime, including violent crime, because people in the drug business can\u2019t use the courts to enforce contracts and settle disputes. And prohibition reduces access to a product that many people enjoy and use responsibly \u2014 though it\u2019s not that hard to buy marijuana even where it\u2019s illegal.But Mr. Kleiman warns that full-scale commercial legalization comes with costs of its own. The main risk is that marijuana businesses will \u2014 as alcohol and tobacco companies did \u2014 successfully market their products to heavy users who would be better off using less, and that they will resist regulations that discourage problem use.Mr. Kleiman shares Mr. Frum\u2019s fear that commercial legalization advocates will win the day (they\u2019ve won in the last few states where marijuana has been on the ballot, after all). But the question remains: What\u2019s the alternative?\u201cThe only hope to beat commercial legalization is with a successful noncommercial legalization,\u201d Mr. Kleiman says, \u201cbecause prohibition is over.\u201dMr. Kleiman agrees with Ms. Mangu-Ward that Washington won\u2019t have a true gift economy in marijuana. He expects small-scale illegal sales of the drug to continue, but he isn\u2019t necessarily bothered by it.\u201cI kind of distinguish between flagrant and discreet drug dealing,\u201d he says. \u201cDiscreet drug dealing happens in multipurpose locations indoors. Flagrant drug dealing occurs outdoors or in dedicated locations\u201d \u2014 think street corners and crack houses. \u201cDiscreet drug dealing doesn\u2019t attract much crime, while a flagrant dealer is a target.\u201dIn other words, Washington\u2019s reform isn\u2019t about making the marijuana trade truly, totally noncommercial. It\u2019s about making the commercial aspects of the marijuana trade mostly harmless, occurring discreetly inside people\u2019s homes, without attendant violence or mass marketing. Mr. Kleiman compares the issue to gambling \u2014 your home poker game might be illegal, but isn\u2019t likely to cause violent crime or draw government attention in the way a full-scale gambling operation might.That\u2019s a theory \u2014 but it\u2019s one we\u2019ll get to test over the next few years. If Mr. Kleiman is right about noncommercial legalization, Washington should find success. \u201cYou really want to see decreased criminal justice involvement, you want to see an absence of flagrant public dealing and you want to not see the long supply chains and the marketing,\u201d he said. Then, on the usage side, you want to see that problem use hasn\u2019t risen. You can measure that through surveys, though he also proposes a couple of novel ways, including collecting samples from the city\u2019s sewer system or of hair clippings from barbershops and salons, to measure the population-level amount of cannabis metabolites showing up in urine and hair.If the hair samples start showing a lot more T.H.C. metabolites, we\u2019ll know Washington residents are smoking significantly more weed. Of course, most of those users aren\u2019t problem users, but because the problem users have the highest usage, Mr. Kleiman argues the quantity of metabolites should be a good proxy for the total amount of problem use.We often hear that state and local governments are \u201claboratories of democracy,\u201d but in this case, that will be more literally true than usual.Advertisement"}

He says that he sleeps with both eyes open. Few Venezuelans even know where he lives.But no matter the dangers, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro says that no one will scare him, fool him or divert him from carrying out the mission that the \u201ceternal Commander Ch\u00e1vez\u201d has given him \u201cuntil the end of the end of the roads, now and forever.\u201dBut now, two years after the death of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, with his country sinking deeper into an economic crisis, what was once Mr. Maduro\u2019s greatest advantage \u2014 his absolute loyalty to the former leader \u2014 may have become his greatest handicap.\u201cThe government inaction, the inertia, comes from a belief that you find in Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his government about defending Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s legacy, as if nothing that Ch\u00e1vez left can be touched, nothing can be changed or corrected because that would be considered a betrayal,\u201d said Victor \u00c1lvarez, a leftist economist and former government minister under Mr. Ch\u00e1vez.\u201cMaduro has a tragic destiny,\u201d said Alberto Barrera, a newspaper columnist and novelist. He argued that Mr. Maduro has to blame the United States and other enemies for the country\u2019s problems because to do otherwise would recognize that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s legacy is flawed.\u201cMaduro knows that he has to confront a very big crisis, but to accept and recognize the crisis is to recognize that Ch\u00e1vez and the revolution failed,\u201d Mr. Barrera added.While Mr. Maduro sticks to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s legacy in economic matters \u2014 including price controls and government ownership of major companies that have stagnated and been mismanaged \u2014 many Venezuelans argue that he may have surpassed Mr. Ch\u00e1vez in one area: his attacks on the political opposition.Mr. Ledezma now sits in the Ramo Verde military prison, along with Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, the leader of a political party who championed last year\u2019s protests, and Daniel Ceballos, a former mayor. Another former opposition mayor, Enzo Scarano, was recently released.Mr. Ch\u00e1vez also sought regularly to intimidate the opposition, and he drove some opposing politicians into exile with threats to have them arrested. But opposition leaders say that being politically active is much riskier today.\u201cMaduro\u2019s problem is that he does not project leadership, so he has to make up for it by trying to look strong,\u201d said Stalin Gonz\u00e1lez, an opposition legislator. \u201cPeople laugh at him; they don\u2019t take him seriously. It\u2019s like a bully at school. They laugh at him, and he resorts to violence so that they will respect him.\u201dMr. Maduro, a civilian with no military background, has loaded his government with military officers to a greater extent than Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, a former paratrooper who celebrated the trappings of military life.The ministers of finance, the interior and food and Mr. Maduro\u2019s chief of staff are military officers, as are a number of other cabinet members.Mr. Maduro has also lavished perks on the military, giving the armed forces their own television station, a bank and other prizes.That has raised questions of whether Mr. Maduro has drawn the military close to build alliances, whether he is a captive of interests beyond his control, or both.Yet to many he still seems stuck in Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s shadow. Even his backers describe him in relation to his mentor.\u201cHe learned from Ch\u00e1vez to look at reality straight on and attack it as it is,\u201d said Roy Daza, a member of Mr. Maduro\u2019s United Socialist Party in the Latin American Parliament, a regional body.Critics say that attack typically focuses on the symptoms, not the roots, of longstanding problems. Faced with huge lines and shortages of basic items like corn flour or sugar, Mr. Maduro has jailed retail executives while steadfastly maintaining the price controls that many economists say cause the problem.\u201cInstead of attacking the structural causes that create these problems, they are attacking the consequences,\u201d Mr. \u00c1lvarez, the former minister under Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, said of Mr. Maduro\u2019s government.Mr. Maduro has shown a talent for juggling internal pressures and factions within the movement left behind by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, sidelining some rivals and accommodating others.He pushed Jorge Giordani, a close adviser to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, out of government and then suppressed a mini-revolt by Mr. Giordani\u2019s supporters in his party\u2019s left wing. And he has marginalized Rafael Ram\u00edrez, the powerful former head of the government oil company, PDVSA, removing him from that post and other crucial positions before finally packing him off as ambassador to the United Nations.But Diosdado Cabello, the president of the National Assembly and a former military officer, is considered Mr. Maduro\u2019s main rival for power and also the government figure with the greatest influence within the armed forces.All that has led to a kind of Kremlinology here, with observers speculating on who is behind government actions and whether Mr. Maduro is fully in control.\u201cThere is a lot of internal division. Does Diosdado have more power than Maduro, does someone else?\u201d said Daniel Cuevas, a government worker who voted for Mr. Maduro but is unhappy with the country\u2019s direction. \u201cIn the end, that hurts the people.\u201dDespite his tough talk, Mr. Maduro has also earned a reputation for Hamlet-like indecisiveness. He has spoken for over a year about raising gasoline prices, the world\u2019s lowest, but has taken no action. A long-promised foreign exchange reform last month turned out to be a tweak.\u201cHe is an enigma for Venezuelans,\u201d said Mr. Barrera, the columnist, pointing to the mystery around Mr. Maduro\u2019s residence as a metaphor for his presidency.The official presidential mansion, known as La Casona, is still occupied by one of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s daughters, Rosa Virginia, and her husband, Vice President Jorge Arreaza. Mr. Maduro has said the house is for the use of the late president\u2019s family, for their protection.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t even moved into the house that corresponds to him\u201d as president, Mr. Barrera said. \u201cHe says that he is going to stand up to the gringos, but he hasn\u2019t even been able to stand up to Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s daughter so that he can occupy the presidential mansion.\u201dA government official, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said that Mr. Maduro lives in a residence inside a Caracas military base, Fort Tiuna.On the air, he describes himself as the victim of international machinations. The evidence he offers is often colorful but far from convincing to many Venezuelans, including many supporters. He rarely appears in public without his wife, Cilia Flores, a former legislator whom he calls the First Combatant.At 52, his thick brush of hair and mustache often appear jet black, as if painted on, barely showing signs of gray. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was quoted as commenting on Mr. Maduro\u2019s lustrous hair when the two met recently in Brazil during President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s inauguration, saying, \u201cIf I had your hair, I\u2019d be president of the United States.\u201dBut in a recent speech, Mr. Maduro sounded hurt that Mr. Obama had not returned the attention.\u201cI regret very much, Mr. Obama, that you have let yourself be led down a dead-end street,\u201d he said. \u201cI regret that in a year in which I made public appeals to you, I sent you a letter, I sent you emissaries, you have, in an arrogant way, refused to speak to me. I\u2019m as much a president as you are.\u201dPatricia Torres contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Herzog, a consensus-builder short on charisma, was slow and soft in his response to the onslaught, and never quite crossed the threshold as a strong-leader alternative.If Mr. Herzog was selling hope against Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s fear, fear won in part because Israelis are not hopeful about the situation they see surrounding them.\u201cOf course they made mistakes, but not terrible mistakes, not tragic mistakes. It\u2019s much deeper than that,\u201d said Yossi Sarid, who served as a leftist Parliament member and minister from 1974 to 2006.\u201cPhilosophical arguments, theoretical arguments, are not for influence \u2014 the only factor which influences sometimes is reality by itself,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople think what they see, and as long as our reality is like the reality of the Titanic before the collision, or in Pompeii in the last days before the eruption, so nobody will influence them or convince them.\u201dAri Shavit, a prominent columnist and author, said the Zionist Union also failed to articulate what, exactly, Israelis could be hopeful for, promising only to improve relations with Washington and try to return to negotiations with a Palestinian leadership that most Israeli Jews do not see as a partner for peace.\u201cHope was very hollow, and fear is much deeper,\u201d Mr. Shavit said. \u201cThe peaceniks have never internalized the fact that the right got something right, and the only way to fight the right is by giving an answer.\u201cThey didn\u2019t market the utopian peace because no one in this country will buy it,\u201d he continued. \u201cInstead, they sold ignoring the occupation, and ignoring the traumas. They didn\u2019t bring a new, benign peace context that is solid and realistic.\u201dOn the eve of the recent Israeli election, the prime minister said that no Palestinian state would be created on his watch. Two days later, he began to backtrack.Some say a better strategy would have been to fight fear with fear. \u201cInstead of shouting \u2018things are terrible,\u2019 the left wing should have told the public the truth,\u201d Sever Plocker argued in the newspaper Yediot Aharonot. \u201c\u00a0\u2018Yes, right now your situation is good, but Netanyahu\u2019s policy vis-\u00e0-vis the Palestinians is necessarily leading to the establishment of a binational state in which things will be bad, very bad, for you and us. Truly scary.\u2019\u00a0\u201d But Mr. Herzog said in the interview that Israelis had been warned of isolation and a binational state \u201cfor 50 years, that\u2019s long term.\u201d And in any case, he said, \u201cIf you hit too hard on that people view it as a kind of lefty position, you\u2019re with our enemies.\u201dHe complained that Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s campaign consisted of \u201ca lot of lying, a lot of false blame and false rhetoric,\u201d and acknowledged, \u201cWe found ourselves kind of defending ourselves uselessly about it.\u201d\u201cWhat could be our hate rhetoric?\u201d he asked rhetorically at one point. \u201cI\u2019m trying to think.\u201dThe son of Israel\u2019s sixth president and grandson of its first chief rabbi, Mr. Herzog has since 2003 served in Parliament as a member of the left-leaning Labor Party. Yet for the bulk of a 40-minute conversation, he spoke of the center, not the left, and then ultimately defined his camp as \u201cthe center-center-left.\u201d\u201cI have huge respect for the left \u2014 the left is bold, the left is very focused and is very ideological \u2014 but most of the rank and file of the Israeli public wants something more pragmatic,\u201d he said. \u201cI moved my party to the center and I will continue forcefully to stage my party to the center. The only way to win in Israel is by being in the center.\u201dThe Israeli leader\u2019s settlement policy resembles his predecessors\u2019, but it is a march toward permanence at a time when prospects for peace are few.Mr. Herzog acknowledged that his campaign failed to expand the center-left base. Next time, he said, he would reach out more to the working-class and children of immigrants. He would emphasize Jewish tradition, understanding the damage caused when the Israeli artist Yair Garbuz derided Israelis who hold old customs dear at the left\u2019s big pre-election rally. He said he would also try to forge a deeper alliance with Arab lawmakers who have until now operated outside the political and parliamentary mainstream.Last weekend, Mr. Herzog made a brief getaway with his wife to an upscale spa resort in Israel\u2019s north. By Tuesday, he had resumed meeting with activists in the Tel Aviv suburbs of Petah Tikva and Yehud. On Wednesday, he was taking meetings in the back room of Shine & Sharp, a Tel Aviv steakhouse, fueled by a bottle of Coke Zero.He said he had not spoken with Mr. Netanyahu since calling him to concede on the morning after the election, despite persistent rumors that they might yet join forces \u2014 rumors he did not definitely deny.\u201cNetanyahu said there\u2019s a huge chasm between us. He said during the elections that we are anti-Zionists, and he said during the election that I will basically sell the country to the Arabs,\u201d Mr. Herzog said. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything to the contrary. I\u2019m not intending to be the troubleshooter or the fixer or the bleaching element in his government.\u201cWe will try to expose the weakness of this coalition,\u201d he said. \u201cMy goal will always be to bring hope, to show that there is a sincere, reasonable and sensible voice in the arena.\u201dIsabel Kershner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Premier Sketches a Lofty Vision for Private Enterprise but Warns of Obstacles", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Premier Li Keqiang, in his annual speech to the nation, warned Thursday that China would have to overcome economic inefficiencies, excess capacity and impediments to private enterprise if it were to maintain healthy rates of growth.In his state-of-the-nation report to the National People\u2019s Congress, the Communist Party-run legislature, which meets in full session once a year, Mr. Li lowered the target for economic growth to \u201capproximately 7 percent\u201d and announced new policies and programs that he said would encourage a more robust private sector to create jobs and foster innovation, moving the country away from its dependence on government-led infrastructure investment, heavy industry and low-end exports.Mr. Li acknowledged in his opening remarks that the transition would weigh on total growth and would face challenges.\u201cChina\u2019s economic development has entered a new normal,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cSystemic, institutional and structural problems have become \u2018tigers in the road,\u2019 holding up development. Without deepening reform and making economic structural adjustments, we will have a difficult time sustaining steady and sound development.\u201dSpeaking in front of nearly 3,000 appointed delegates to the congress, Mr. Li sketched out an expansive and lofty vision for fostering economic growth and improving the lives of China\u2019s 1.3 billion citizens. He promised to add 10 million urban jobs, increase monthly pension payments to retirees by 10 percent, build 7.4 million units of government-subsidized housing and construct nearly 5,000 miles of rail.Yet much of his so-called work report to the nation focused on encouraging private enterprise, increasing consumer spending and lightening the heavy hand of a government that has long directed economic growth, at times squeezing out innovation and small businesses.He repeatedly signaled the leadership\u2019s determination to reduce the nation\u2019s dependence on infrastructure construction \u2014 spending that economists have warned is often inefficient and unprofitable and that has helped lead to the worrying levels of debt accrued by local governments across the country. Instead, he said, China will make market forces and consumer demand its priorities.\u201cIn expanding consumption, we need to ensure that every drop of spending builds to create a mighty river, so that the potential contained in an ocean of private consumers will be channeled into a powerful force driving economic growth,\u201d he said.Like previous work reports, Mr. Li\u2019s speech was suffused with an almost utopian vision of China\u2019s future and a grab bag of proposals to enhance the lives of ordinary people.In his vision, college graduates would get more help finding fulfilling jobs, workers would get more guaranteed paid holidays, and migrant workers would find it easier to enroll their children in urban schools. Yet many of the proposals were short on details, and the report appeared to gloss over some of the more pressing challenges facing the nation.The government has appeared surprised by the depth of the economic slowdown, and that has sapped policy makers\u2019 potential appetite for bolder changes in land policy, banking and credit, and other major drivers of growth, Tao Ran, an economics professor and director of the China Center for Public Economics and Governance at Renmin University, said in a phone interview.\u201cWe see very little progress in reform in real sectors of the economy that could boost growth,\u201d Professor Tao said. \u201cAll the real economic reforms are very difficult to carry out, but the economic slowdown has made the government nervous, and they began to stimulate again. I think we need faster economic reforms to get the economy on the right track.\u201dYet the government also faces public anger about the air pollution that bathes many regions and the wealth gap that many citizens believe has channeled too much money to a politically privileged minority.In the documentary, \u201cUnder the Dome,\u201d a former Chinese television reporter, Chai Jing, explored officials\u2019 and state companies\u2019 failure to enforce environmental protection standards.In an annual policy report released at the same time as Mr. Li\u2019s work report, the National Development and Reform Commission, which oversees economic policy, promised \u201cunremitting efforts\u201d to improve the environment and encourage cleaner energy use.The commission said it would \u201cstrictly control\u201d any new energy-intensive industrial projects in regions already afflicted by severe smog.Mr. Li issued targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions by at least 3.1 percent and said the government would introduce legislation for what he called \u201can environmental protection tax,\u201d although he provided no details.He added that the government would seek to convert more than 1.6 million acres of farmland to forest or grassland and would plant trees on an additional 15 million acres.In contrast with his predecessor, Wen Jiabao, Mr. Li did not mention political reform in his report. He made only passing reference to fighting official corruption, the centerpiece of President Xi Jinping\u2019s agenda since he came to power in 2012.In November 2012, Mr. Xi presided over a Communist Party leadership meeting that endorsed a sweeping list of proposals to restructure the economy, tapping new sources of growth in consumption and the service sector. So far, though, the government has shown no appetite for a dramatic shake-up of state-owned conglomerates that dominate arteries of the economy, including energy and finance.But the report from the National Development and Reform Commission signaled that deeper changes could be coming to the state-dominated sectors of the economy, including the energy behemoths that were a target of Ms. Chai\u2019s documentary.\u201cWe will deepen structural reforms of electricity, petroleum and natural gas industries,\u201d said the report, which added that the government would encourage more private investment in public utilities, financial services and other areas still dominated by government-run players.The commission also hinted that barriers to foreign investors in some industries could be lowered, though it gave no specifics.Mr. Xi\u2019s government has pursued a dramatic drive against corruption, featuring images of disheveled officials being dragged off by investigators. But it has taken a more measured \u2014 and, some complain, tardy \u2014 approach to economic change, one that is reflected in part in the modest shifts in growth targets.China last lowered its annual target for gross domestic product in 2012, reducing it to 7.5 percent from 8 percent, where it had been fixed since 2005. Before 2014, the last time China missed a growth target was 1998, after the Asian currency crisis, when G.D.P. came in at 7.8 percent against a target of 8 percent.In his report, Mr. Li also set a consumer price inflation target of 3 percent, down from last year\u2019s 3.5 percent \u2014 a nod to notable forces at work in the economy, where consumer price inflation hit a five-year low in January.\u201cStepping down G.D.P. targets to 7 percent demonstrates the reality of China\u2019s potential current growth and the reality that the Xi leadership is dealing with the problems that come with reform, rather than the problems that come with deferring reform through further monetary permissiveness,\u201d said Daniel H. Rosen, founding partner of the Rhodium Group, an economic research and advisory firm.By shifting to a softer growth target with an \u201caround\u201d qualifier, the government is also signaling its intent to focus more on the composition of economic growth than on its absolute pace. But doing away with targets altogether would be a step too far for China at the moment, experts say.Setting a softer growth goal represents \u201ca helpful step away from the tradition of specifying a target,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. \u201cFor now, however, too many aspects of China\u2019s fiscal system still rely on this annual touchstone to abolish it altogether.\u201dAndrew Jacobs reported from Beijing, and Neil Gough from Hong Kong.

Did Jerry Brown \u2014 the tax-raising, Obamacare-embracing governor of California \u2014 engineer his state\u2019s boom? No, and few liberals would claim otherwise. What we\u2019ve been seeing at both the national and the state level is mainly a natural process of recovery as the economy finally starts to heal from the housing and debt bubbles of the Bush years.But recent job growth, nonetheless, has big political implications \u2014 implications so disturbing to many on the right that they are in frantic denial, claiming that the recovery is somehow bogus. Why can\u2019t they handle the good news? The answer actually comes on three levels: Obama Derangement Syndrome, or O.D.S.; Reaganolatry; and the confidence con.Not much need be said about O.D.S. It is, by now, a fixed idea on the right that this president is both evil and incompetent, that everything touched by the atheist Islamic Marxist Kenyan Democrat \u2014 mostly that last item \u2014 must go terribly wrong. When good news arrives about the budget, or the economy, or Obamacare \u2014 which is, by the way, rapidly reducing the number of uninsured while costing much less than expected \u2014 it must be denied.Actually, if creating \u201cmillions of jobs\u201d means adding two million or more jobs in a given year, we\u2019ve done that 13 times since Reagan left office: eight times under Bill Clinton, twice under George W. Bush, and three times, so far, under Barack Obama. But who\u2019s counting?Still, don\u2019t liberals have similar delusions? Not really. The economy added 23 million jobs under Clinton, compared with 16 million under Reagan, but there\u2019s nothing on the left comparable to the cult of the Blessed Ronald. That\u2019s because liberals don\u2019t need to claim that their policies will produce spectacular growth. All they need to claim is feasibility: that we can do things like, say, guaranteeing health insurance to everyone without killing the economy. Conservatives, on the other hand, want to block such things and, instead, to cut taxes on the rich and slash aid to the less fortunate. So they must claim both that liberal policies are job killers and that being nice to the rich is a magic elixir.Which brings us to the last point: the confidence con.One enduring puzzle of political economy is why business interests so often oppose policies to fight unemployment. After all, boosting the economy with expansionary monetary and fiscal policy is good for profits as well as wages, yet many wealthy individuals and business leaders demand tight money and austerity instead. As a number of observers have pointed out, however, for big businesses to admit that government policies can create jobs would be to devalue one of their favorite political arguments \u2014 the claim that to achieve prosperity politicians must preserve business confidence, among other things, by refraining from any criticism of what businesspeople do.So, as I said at the beginning, the fact that we\u2019re now seeing mornings in blue America \u2014 solid job growth both at the national level and in states that have defied the right\u2019s tax-cutting, deregulatory orthodoxy \u2014 is a big problem for conservatives. Although they would never admit it, events have proved their most cherished beliefs wrong. Advertisement"}

That resulted in a mere 2 percent advance over a year earlier, washing away the encouraging jump in January.Despite the disappointing wage numbers, the report prompted a new round of optimism about the economy\u2019s comeback from the recession along with fresh talk on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates at its June meeting rather than wait until September.The news led to a sharp rise on Friday in the yield on 10-year bonds and a substantial drop in the stock market, where investors feared that higher interest rates would make equities less attractive and chip away at corporate profits.The Labor Department said Friday the unemployment Rate in the United States decreased to 5.50 percent in February of 2015 from 5.70 percent in January of 2015. That\u2019s the lowest unemployment rate since May 2008. This month 295,000 jobs were created, exceeding economists\u2019 expectations.Job growth last month was heavily concentrated in the service sector, with leisure and hospitality adding 66,000 jobs, as well as an expansion of 54,000 jobs in education and health. Construction added 29,000 jobs in February, while manufacturing increased by a modest 8,000. Gains were also made in professional services and the trade and transport sectors.Still, one consistently dark patch in the recovery has been the sluggish growth of wages. It suggests that the economy is still far from returning to its potential and is a big factor behind the sense among many Americans that the recovery has largely left them behind.\u201cEveryone knows of someone who has been laid off or has a friend or relative who has been laid off,\u201d said Gary N. Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. \u201cWe hear we\u2019re on the road to recovery, but people aren\u2019t convinced of that.\u201dAnother reason for the disenchantment is that millions of potential workers remain detached from the job market. The labor participation rate, which counts both those with jobs and those looking for them, has stabilized, but at lows last seen in the late 1970s, falling slightly in February to 62.8 percent, from 62.9 percent.On the brighter side, the share of long-term unemployed, those who are out of work for 27 weeks or more, declined to 36.8 percent. That is still well above where it was when the recession began in late 2007, but it has fallen by almost six percentage points in the last year, said Omair Sharif, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.And with the economy galloping ahead, many analysts say it is only a matter of time before wages start to increase at a faster pace as payrolls expand and companies need to compete more aggressively to attract employees.For now the economy is creating some distinct winners and losers, with women gaining an edge.The unemployment rate for adult women ages 20 and older was 4.9 percent in February, down from 5.1 percent in January, according to the National Women\u2019s Law Center. February was the first time the adult women\u2019s unemployment rate had been below 5 percent since July 2008.Among women, some are doing better than others. The unemployment rate for adult white women was 4.2 percent in February, down from 4.4 percent in January.But adult black women\u2019s unemployment rate rose in February to 8.9 from 8.7 percent in January and 8.2 percent in December. Unemployment rates for adult Hispanic women declined slightly in February from January, to 6.1 percent from 6.2 percent, a new low for this group but still well above women\u2019s overall unemployment rate.Women accounted for 55 percent of the new jobs added in February, according to the law center. But 39 percent of the jobs that went to women were in retail and leisure and hospitality, which typically pay lower wages.\u201cFebruary posted strong job gains and a decline in overall unemployment, but many women have yet to see a real recovery,\u201d said Joan Entmacher, vice president for family economic security at the law center.Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez called all those moves \u201ca shot in the arm.\u201d\u201cAs we continue to have month after month of significant job growth, what we will see invariably is a tighter labor market,\u201d Mr. Perez said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd tighter labor markets mean higher wages.\u201dMore of the new jobs are full time. Last month, the number of workers who said they were working part time for economic reasons fell, leaving their share of all part-time workers at 25.1 percent, down from 25.6 percent in the previous month.Labor advocates like the National Employment Law Project say retailers should also be doing more to add hours as well as lifting pay for some workers.The group says too many people, many of them women, want full-time work but can\u2019t find it. The number of adults who work part time but who want to work on full-time schedules is 50 percent above the number reported in 2007, according to Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.Shannon Henderson, 29, works part time in customer service at a Walmart store in Sacramento, and supports two children with her $10-an-hour wages. Her hours are unpredictable, often interfering with her breast-feeding schedule for her 9-month-old.She says that she wants to work more, but that the company did not have more full-time positions. If she tried to work a second job, she said, she might miss a shift at Walmart and jeopardize her job there. And more hours would allow her to buy a car, providing her with greater flexibility. But for now, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t make enough money.\u201d Advertisement"}

In Austria, up to 550 people a week had been arriving this year, though the flow has trickled to 40 to 50 a week, the Austrian federal criminal office said Wednesday.Forty-six people were arrested on Tuesday, including eight in Vienna, 16 in the Czech Republic, 12 in France, four in Hungary, three in Kosovo, two in Slovakia and one in Germany, the pan-European Europol and Eurojust offices in The Hague announced.Thirty-one others accused of being part of a network of smugglers had been arrested in raids since last October, the Austrian federal criminal office said.Michela Kohlweiss, head of the police in the southern Austrian state of Carinthia, told reporters that Kosovars were lured north by Facebook pages depicting the good life in Europe with photos of bundles of 500 euro notes, jewelry and alcohol.Facilitators charged 2,800 euros, or $3,080 per person, or \u20ac7,000 for a whole family to be smuggled from Kosovo, through Serbia and into Hungary, where some claimed asylum. Others were smuggled onward in vehicles through Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany and Austria to final destinations in Switzerland, Italy and France, Europol and Eurojust said in a statement.Authorities in the destination countries have mounted a strong campaign against migration from Kosovo and even sent their own police officers to the Serbian-Hungarian border to stop the flow. Kosovo Albanians who rejoiced in their declaration of independence in 2008 have said the shattered economy and corruption in their country has left them no choice but to leave the impoverished Balkans and seek work in western Europe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Mexico Oil Market, Mood Moves From Excited to Anxious", "Date": "2015-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith oil fetching around $100 a barrel at the time, the projections were ambitious. Over the next four years, Mexico would attract more than $12 billion in investment a year. By 2018, private companies would be pumping half a million new barrels of oil a day.Now, oil prices have sunk to almost half that level, and the atmosphere has turned anxious.The question is whether private companies will still be eager to invest. Big energy players have been scaling back their investment plans as oil prices have dropped.To encourage investors to bid, the Mexican government last week sweetened the contract terms. It is also contemplating delaying some auctions until the price environment improves.The energy reform is at the core of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s efforts to jump-start the economy after decades of anemic growth. The hope is that private companies will invest heavily in developing new oil and gas fields, creating jobs and adding to the government coffers.\u201cThe Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration put all its eggs in the basket of energy reform,\u201d said Luis Miguel Labardini, a consultant at Marcos y Asociados, a Mexico City energy consultancy. \u201cIf they mess it up, this administration is doomed.\u201dAttracting private money has taken on new urgency as low oil prices have sped up the decline at the state-owned oil company, Pemex. Squeezed by high taxes and hobbled by government control, Pemex spends \u2014 and borrows \u2014 more each year to pump less and less oil. Its daily production has slipped to below 2.4 million barrels, a million lower than its peak a decade ago.Adding to Pemex\u2019s woes, the government has sliced the company\u2019s 2015 budget by about $4 billion. The move stymies the company\u2019s push to remake itself as a competitive deepwater producer. Pemex\u2019s chief executive, Emilio Lozoya, said that the company would delay some of its independent exploration plans in the Gulf of Mexico and look for deep-pocketed partners.Mr. Lozoya argues that the company\u2019s problems are manageable. \u201cPemex would be in a situation of real emergency if the energy reform hadn\u2019t given us the instruments we now have to use money from third parties to carry out our investment projects,\u201d he said in a recent radio interview.As its financial position weakens, Pemex has begun to cut.A long-delayed modernization at three refineries was postponed. The company didn\u2019t renew the contracts of some 10,000 workers employed through outsourcing companies. Pemex also got the union to agree to some $650 million in cuts to perks and benefits, accept early retirement plans for older employees and leave unfilled positions vacant.Pemex is even planning for the unthinkable: layoffs among its 150,000-strong work force, including members of its politically powerful union. \u201cThere would have to be a reduction,\u201d Pedro Joaqu\u00edn Coldwell, the energy secretary, said this week.The government had hoped to move swiftly to open its oil fields to private investment, planning to offer monthly auctions for contracts on 169 different blocks, from the Gulf of Mexico to shale gas deposits on the Texas border. But gathering all the information for investors and designing attractive contracts is proving more complicated than expected.Energy officials admit that a lot is riding on the results of the first auction in July, when the government will award a package of 14 exploration blocks in low-cost shallow waters. \u201cPolitically, the success of the first auction is the highest priority,\u201d said Mr. Coldwell. \u201cIt\u2019s the national and international reference.\u201dBut the low oil price may delay plans for bids on expensive shale and other oil fields that are more complex.\u201cWe are aware that certain areas will not be as interesting as they were when the barrel was over $100,\u201d Lourdes Melgar, Mexico\u2019s under secretary for hydrocarbons, said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t want because of the current situation to give away areas.\u201dAs oil companies decide where to spend shrinking investment budgets, Mexico has an advantage, she argued.\u201cThis is a highly productive oil area,\u201d Ms. Melgar said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking of an area where we know there are resources, both conventional and unconventional, and where we have a lot of diversity. You\u2019re not talking about a frontier area.\u201dPolitical factors come into play as well. As a democracy bordering the United States, Mexico \u201cis just in a different world\u201d compared with oil producers such as Iraq and Nigeria, said Carlos Pascual, a former energy envoy for the United States State Department and currently a senior vice president at IHS, a consulting firm.Unlike its Latin American competitors Venezuela and Argentina, which constantly change bidding rules, Mexico\u2019s rules are stable and transparent, said Jorge Pi\u00f1on, an energy analyst at the University of Texas Austin.Still, the low prices forced the Mexican government to make changes last week on its initial proposed contracts. The new rules for the first exploration package and a second group of shallow-water production blocks to be awarded in September relax the minimum investment requirements. They also loosen restrictions on the types of companies and partnerships that are allowed to bid.Perhaps most important, private investors will keep a larger percentage of their profits as their returns rise, whether because the oil price bounces back or because the field is more productive than expected. Profits are split with the government.\u201cWe are under a different market scenario,\u201d said Juan Carlos Zepeda, the president of the National Hydrocarbons Commission, the regulator charged with conducting the auctions.While the changing market hasn\u2019t altered the government\u2019s goal of increasing output by 500,000 barrels a day, \u201cexperts say it\u2019s very dubious,\u201d said Jeremy Martin, director of the energy program at the Institute of the Americas in San Diego. Still, he says he believes that many oil companies remain interested in Mexico over the long term.Others are more skeptical. David Shields, an oil analyst here, questioned whether production costs were as low as the government suggested. \u201cThe low-cost easy fields are running out,\u201d he said, pointing to Pemex\u2019s problems. \u201cJust how this whole thing is going to play out I don\u2019t know. The value of the exploration and production business has been cut in half.\u201dFor now, oil companies are leaving their options open. Some 35 paid for access to a hermetic data room where they can study seismic information on the blocks. Of those, 23 have taken the first steps to qualify for bidding, including Shell, Chevron and Petrobras.\u201cWe constantly have to look for additional resources,\u201d said Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa and Latin America Exploration and Production Company. \u201cMexico is a long-term strategy for us.\u201dBut he warned that the \u201cfiscal terms will drive the opportunity.\u201dAlthough auctions for shale fields in northern Mexico may not go forward, the regulator, Mr. Zepeda, was confident that the deepwater one would. Mexico\u2019s prospective reserves lie under the Gulf of Mexico in a region called the Perdido Fold Belt, where deepwater production has been successful in United States waters just to the north.It takes eight years for a deepwater development to produce the first barrel of oil, he said, so companies look at the long-term price when they weigh their spending. \u201cWhen you are turning to look at those projects,\u201d he said, \u201cthe spot price is not very relevant.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And as had happened before, the only metal he left with was a pair of handcuffs slapped to his wrists.For generations, scavengers have prowled this city with impunity, pouncing on abandoned properties and light poles to pilfer steel, copper and other metals they could trade for cash at scrapyards. The practice left tens of thousands of buildings so damaged that they could not be restored, turning places like the North End into grim cityscapes that appeared to have been ravaged by a tornado.In recent years, the city has become serious about fighting back. It razed dozens of rickety homes \u2014 lucrative scrapping targets \u2014 in this neighborhood alone in the past year. Residents have become increasingly vigilant about chasing scrappers away from their blocks, lawmakers have enacted rules making it more difficult to turn a quick profit from scrapping, and the police and private and public agencies have stepped up enforcement efforts.The battle has been critical in places like the North End, a community with both expansive blight and bright economic potential, given its proximity to the city\u2019s cultural and commercial heart.Yet even as the crackdown on scrapping helps make neighborhoods like the North End look better, it is sounding a death knell for part of the underground economy that took root during Detroit\u2019s long years of decay. And with that, people who continue to have bleak job prospects in the city\u2019s stubbornly sluggish economy are finding their struggle to survive that much harder.Today, Mr. Jones, who goes by the nickname Rabbi, subsists by Dumpster diving, doing odd jobs and, when he sees the opportunity, scavenging scrap metal. It is a dreary existence, evident in his drowsy eyes, a hardened face surrounded by a gray mane, a voice groggy from endless nights of sleeping in the biting cold and the torn and smeared jackets he wears in layers.He never graduated from high school because his mother died when he was a senior and he was too anguished to continue, he said. He has seven children by several women, but he lost contact with them in part because of his drug addiction, which he said he kicked six years ago. He avoids his three siblings even though, he said, he believes they would help him if he asked. He lives in an abandoned house.\u201cI don\u2019t want them feeling my pain,\u201d he said of his siblings, noting that his sister cried the last time she saw him.Mr. Jones was arrested at the yard on Jan. 31 while he and another North End man were toting a large bag with six pieces of scrap metal, including four heavy discs and a 14-inch pipe, according to a police report. A few days later, his file crossed the desk of Sgt. Rebecca L. McKay, who, as head of the police unit that handles metal theft, has gained a reputation as a relentless scrapping enforcer. Now she was faced with the difficult decision of whether to come down hard on a man barely surviving.\u201cI can\u2019t say that I don\u2019t have sympathy for these people,\u201d Sergeant McKay said. \u201cBut they\u2019re breaking the law. Not only are they breaking the law, but they\u2019re affecting the community around them by doing it.\u201dSergeant McKay, 43, embodies this region\u2019s blue-collar ethos. Born in Royal Oak, one of Detroit\u2019s comfortable northern suburbs, she moved to an industrial corridor about 25 minutes south of the city at a young age. Her father worked for a Ford stamping plant, while her mother stayed home to raise her and her brother.When her father was laid off and remained jobless for a few years in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the family received government food rations, she said. Her mother took a job as a police dispatcher, and that sustained them until her father was rehired at another Ford plant.During those years, she got to know police officers through her mother\u2019s job, and the experience bolstered Sergeant McKay\u2019s already budding fascination with law enforcement \u2014 her grandfather worked for the United States Customs Service, and her great-grandfather was a Detroit police detective. Her parents\u2019 response to hardship also influenced her.\u201cI understand that times can get tough,\u201d she said. \u201cBut no matter how tough the times got, my dad didn\u2019t resort to stealing, and neither did my mother.\u201dSo when she became a Detroit police officer nearly two decades ago, Sergeant McKay tried to balance her understanding of adversity with her belief that there was an honest way to get through anything. After years of working on patrol and narcotics, she found an outlet that allowed her to help the city reverse its decay \u2014 the copper theft task force.Thieves dismantled the plumbing, water tanks and heating systems of empty homes and schools. They left buildings in such disrepair that no one could restore them, and those eyesores helped drive down other property values.Scrappers also targeted utilities, scaling poles during the light of day to cut down electrical lines in search of precious copper, leaving highly charged wires splayed dangerously on the street and causing sporadic power failures. Streetlights died, and neighborhoods went dark.At the height of Detroit\u2019s scrapping problem in 2007, DTE Energy, a utility company, reported 361 power line thefts; AT & T reported 444. Last year, about 40,000 structures in the city were in such poor shape that they needed to be demolished, and officials blamed scrapping for much of that. Last March, Detroit\u2019s police chief, James Craig, said the police academy had lost power after scrappers stole copper wire from a nearby transformer. All told, city officials estimated that scrappers did tens of millions of dollars in damage.In the meantime, though, the city was working hard to cut into the illegal industry that fueled the life of Mr. Jones and many others.Detroit Public Schools installed motion sensor alarms in its vacant buildings. Lawmakers stiffened penalties for people stealing and selling scrap metal, reclassifying some misdemeanors as felonies. The copper theft task force worked with prosecutors and the utility companies to find the main thieves. To ensure that the scrapyards were not buying stolen material, the authorities pressed them to take inventory of who was selling to them.The State Legislature last year passed a measure forbidding scrapyards to pay cash on the spot to anyone offering $25 or more worth of commonly stolen metals like copper, requiring the yards instead to complete the sales by check, debit card or money order in the mail. It also required the yards to photograph both what they were buying and the sellers.Those measures, along with lower commodity prices and increasing scarcity of scrap metal in the city, have made scavenging harder and less lucrative. Wire and metal thefts are down precipitously. Three years ago, the police requested 222 warrants for scrap metal theft; with about 25 requests so far this year, the city is on a much slower pace. In some neighborhoods, including the North End, scrapping is all but a dying criminal art.That does not mean that Sergeant McKay has become any less vigorous in pursuing scrappers and their patrons.Ridding the city of illegal scrappers, Sergeant McKay said, starts with squeezing those who reward the thieves. \u201cWhere there\u2019s no buyer, there\u2019s no seller,\u201d she said.So her four-person unit, which also handles graffiti and illegal dumping, spends much time making sure that scrapyards follow the law. On one sunny Friday afternoon in early February, she ventured out to visit a few yards in southwest Detroit, riding with one of her investigators, Detective Laura Splitt, in one of the department\u2019s unmarked sport utility vehicles.Her mission that afternoon was to gather intelligence on Mr. Jones and five other men accused of stealing from the industrial scrapyard where he was arrested.Mr. Jones, too, is a symbol of working-class Detroit.His father was absent from his life, and his mother raised him and his siblings on public assistance. Mr. Jones said he eventually got factory work. But after being fired from a 7Up bottling plant in the 1990s, he could not find a steady job, he said. For a time, he worked at a blind pig \u2014 an illegal late-night gambling house \u2014 but took to scrapping as his primary source of income.In the 1990s, he could find abundant scrap on street corners and curbs. People who were cleaning out buildings would call him to help cart away metal. He also went the illegal route, sneaking into abandoned buildings.Mr. Jones said he targeted only open, already scavenged buildings; his police record includes more than a half-dozen arrests for breaking and entering. And he said he had never resorted to violence to make money. \u201cSo that\u2019s the way I soothed my conscience,\u201d he said.So it was, in his mind, an honest form of work, one of several in which he engaged. He said proudly that he never begged for cash, but would plead for odd jobs: pumping gas, washing windshields, shoveling driveways. But scrapping was his favorite.\u201cI got to the point where I enjoyed the work,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s a job and an adventure.\u201dHe could earn hundreds of dollars in a single day, he said, allowing him to rent a room in a house. He bought a television and a radio, purchased new clothes and food for himself and his girlfriend. But the money Mr. Jones earned also fed his addiction to crack cocaine.\u201cI could have done a lot of things with a whole lot of that money that I just let go up in smoke,\u201d he said.He saw his life spiraling. He lost contact with his children \u2014 a memory that still brings tears to his eyes. And he became involved with a new partner who had a young son. So Mr. Jones dropped the crack habit.These days, with scrapping both riskier and less lucrative, he increasingly sticks to Dumpster diving, a less prosperous venture. Weeks before his arrest, Mr. Jones was spelunking in a trash bin on a January evening when he found a copper and brass radiator that he would have trouble selling. He does not have a car, and the next day, he could not find anyone to give him a ride to the junkyard. It was nearly noon, and he had not eaten yet.He eventually found help in the form of an \u201cafter-hours man,\u201d a secondhand dealer who pays below-market prices to scrappers in desperate situations, then takes the metal to the yard to sell at full cost.Mr. Jones rolled a baby stroller holding the radiator to an alley near the dealer\u2019s house. A few minutes later, he walked away with $10 in hand and a promise of an additional $10 later \u2014 about half of what Mr. Jones said he would have received if he had made it to the scrapyard.Later that night, he snuggled in bed with some day-old chili fries donated by a Coney Island restaurant in the neighborhood, hoping his body would keep the fries warm enough to be edible in the morning.Mr. Jones stays in the living room of an abandoned two-story frame home where the stench of landfill suffuses the air, wood planks jut out of the walls and the windows are boarded up or covered with trash bags. He sleeps under a heap of blankets, on a soiled mattress he found.When he woke the next morning, he still had a dollar in his pocket, but not enough for food and cigarettes. After the owner of a pay-by-the-hour hotel gave him $5 for hacking dog feces out of the icy yard, Mr. Jones set off westward into a stiff headwind, to hit up his regular garbage containers.At a bend in a quiet street, he lifted himself into a trash bin large enough to fit several hot tubs. He threw out things that might be of value: empty plastic two-liter bottles of Cherry Coke and Faygo Pop, earbuds, an HDMI cable, computer circuits. Within about five minutes, he was off to the next bin, where he pulled out a bunch of empty soda cans. The pep in his stride seemed to increase as he turned down an alley.\u201cCan\u2019t make it to the dollar till you get past that first penny,\u201d Mr. Jones said moments before finding three pennies in the cracked pavement of a parking lot.Finally he arrived at what promised to be the most lucrative location of the day \u2014 a pair of large industrial trash bins next to the loading dock of a high-rise commercial building.His arms clutching the edge and feet dangling into one of the bins, he lowered himself with the gentle agony of someone dipping into an ice bath. He began scooping out treasures: stage lights, power cords, a steel box.After rounding up the scrap in a black trash bag, Mr. Jones stashed some pieces of steel behind the trash bin. They were too heavy to carry, so he planned to find someone with a truck who could haul them later. He balanced the heavy load on his head and, hunching over, lumbered toward his home.Breathing heavily, he stopped and pulled out the bottle of water he had found earlier. \u201cLifesaver!\u201d he said before taking a swig.A complete guide to the bankruptcy of Detroit and the city\u2019s journey of rebuilding.He says he wants to see new money and new energy come into the city, into this neighborhood. He would welcome a full-time job if he could find one, he said. Detroit\u2019s unemployment rate was about 12 percent at the beginning of this year. But he does not believe progress will trickle down to people like him. \u201cI ain\u2019t going to benefit from it,\u201d he said. Later, turning his eyes toward the cloudy sky, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t see no $100 bills falling.\u201dBefore Mr. Jones can think about money, he has to worry about the law nipping at his heels.Sergeant McKay had pictures of six people accused of stealing from the industrial yard \u2014 evidence obtained from the yard\u2019s security patrol and police files. She knew the identities of four of them, including Mr. Jones. Now she was off to find evidence that could help elevate the charges against the men.Her plan was to see if scrapyards had records of buying from the men. If they did, she would investigate what they had sold to the yards. If she could determine that they were selling metal stolen from the industrial yard, or elsewhere, that could help support felony charges.\u201cIt\u2019s not even so much about people going to jail as it is with the state of the city right now, sending the message to these people that this isn\u2019t going to go unnoticed anymore,\u201d she said.She also wanted to keep pressure on the yards.\u201cI compare it to supervising children,\u201d Sergeant McKay said. \u201cThe minute that you turn your head, you know they\u2019re going to get into mischief.\u201dSergeant McKay had barely set foot in the muddy yard of Detroit Iron & Metal when she noticed something suspicious. Two men hacking something with a chain saw immediately stopped when they spotted her. Sergeant McKay did not recognize them, but they appeared to know her.\u201cThey probably have her picture on a dart board,\u201d Detective Splitt joked.Sergeant McKay asked what they were doing, and one of the men nervously told her that they were cutting a transformer. She had never seen that done before, she told them.After the yard\u2019s computer failed to get a hit on any of the suspects, she asked the scale operator, Zarko Bilobrk, about the transformer. He explained that a contractor had brought it in, and they needed to break it down to process it.Sergeant McKay noted that the transformer was leaking a noxious-smelling fluid and said she might call the Environmental Protection Agency.\u201cYou know all that oil that is dumping out of those is really bad,\u201d she told Mr. Bilobrk, who promised to address the situation.Later, Sergeant McKay headed to the yard where she expected to hit pay dirt, Southwest Metals, which was linked to nearly half of her cases last year, she said.As Sergeant McKay and Detective Splitt entered the office, the manager sprang from his chair. He escorted them to a lanky man behind a computer, who punched in the names of the six scrappers, and, bingo, three names popped up, including Mr. Jones\u2019s. But the computer operator said that Mr. Jones had not been there since October \u2014 and the yard did not have a copy of Mr. Jones\u2019s identification available to make sure that this was the correct Robert Jones.The manager told the sergeant and detective that one of the men they were investigating used to come in daily, sometimes twice a day, with as much as 800 pounds of prepared steel, including I-beams that support buildings. This raised a red flag for Sergeant McKay. That type of steel usually comes from large buildings, and unless the sellers have documentation to prove that they were hired to remove it, chances are that they stole it.Sergeant McKay suspected that the seller was a secondhand dealer who had hired what she called \u201cminions\u201d to scavenge properties throughout the city and bring him metal.It was progress. Cracking this case would not solve the city\u2019s scrapping problem, Sergeant McKay acknowledged. But it might mean taking a major illegal dealer off the street and tightening the noose on a problem scrapyard. For her, those would be vital steps in the salvation she preaches for Detroit.What it might mean for Robert Jones was far less clear. After his arrest at the yard, the police held him for about a day before releasing him because they did not have everything they needed to charge him.But Sergeant McKay thought Mr. Jones\u2019s case was worth a closer look.She was unable to come up with data from the scrapyards to confirm that Mr. Jones regularly sold to them. Southwest Metals stalled so much in responding to multiple requests for information, she said, that she filed numerous citations against the business.But, Sergeant McKay said, while looking over the investigative notes from Mr. Jones\u2019s arrest, she saw that he had indicated that he planned to sell the scrap metal he was accused of taking from the industrial yard. For her, that was enough to justify felony charges, and she referred the case to the county prosecutor\u2019s office, which has issued a warrant for Mr. Jones\u2019s arrest.Mr. Jones might earn very little from scrapping, Sergeant McKay said, but she sees him as part of a cycle that destroys properties and, in turn, the city.\u201cIf we can\u2019t get a handle on the Robert Joneses of the city, we\u2019re not going to be able to get a handle on the problem at hand,\u201d she said.Yet Mr. Jones insisted that although he had entered the industrial yard looking for scrap metal, he had taken nothing. And before that moment of weakness and need, he said, he had sworn off illegal ways. He long ago stopped breaking into buildings to steal scrap, he said.Mr. Jones still grabs loose pieces of metal, but he said he had become more determined to keep his scavenging aboveboard since the arrest at the industrial yard.\u201cIt was a rude awakening,\u201d he said.Occasionally these days, he stumbles upon a bit of luck. Recently someone dumped stainless steel cages on a corner field in the North End, allowing Mr. Jones to help himself to the pile.\u201cThat\u2019s what I do,\u201d he said. \u201cOne heartbeat at a time. Until Jesus calls me.\u201dRuin and Renewal: Articles in this series are tracking efforts to revive Detroit\u2019s North End neighborhood.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Going Local in Vietnam\u2019s Villages", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVU LINH, Vietnam \u2014 On a 1996 tour of northern Vietnam, Fredo Binh walked through Vu Linh commune, a cluster of traditional stilt houses beside rice paddies, eucalyptus trees and a tranquil lake.The village, which at the time was accessible only by boat or off-road vehicle, was populated mostly by Dao, one of 54 ethnic groups recognized by the Vietnamese government. Today the lodge has a five-acre site with stilt houses, bungalows, a guava and pomelo orchard and a pen for livestock. But despite the rustic vibe, it also has cozy couches, Wi-Fi and a bar that serves crepes and margaritas. \u201cIt\u2019s fusion,\u201d said Mr. Binh, 48. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be a museum.\u201dAs international tourism grew in Vietnam over the past decade, the country\u2019s rich mix of ethnic minorities and their distinctive cultures became attractions. A few foreign entrepreneurs opened accommodations in the villages of ethnic minorities, hoping to attract foreign travelers interested in their brand of tourism: supporting communities through employment, language and skills training and often long-term purchasing agreements with farmers and artisans. \u201cWe buy a lot of stuff from our neighbors,\u201d said Asger Koppen, managing director of Topas Travel, the Danish parent company of Topas Ecolodge, which lies among such villages near Vietnam\u2019s border with China. \u201cThe idea was to make a showcase of sustainable tourism in a poor area.\u201dThe lodges are a departure from the typical accommodations available in and around the northern town of Sapa, the epicenter of the country\u2019s ethnic-minority tourism, where the usual choice is between Vietnamese-owned hotels and basic homestays.But while many guests have enjoyed the boutique retreats, Mr. Binh and other managers say, they have not been particularly successful from a financial standpoint.The lodge employs about 60 full-time workers, mostly from six local ethnic-minority groups, Mr. Koppen said. Most of the staff members receive years of language and hospitality training, and the lodge purchases the bulk of its food, materials and decorations locally.The lodge has not yet broken even, Mr. Koppen added, but it was never intended to be what he called a \u201ctourism factory\u201d whose only goal was making money.Lo A Cuong, a tour guide from the Tay ethnic group, who has worked at Topas Ecolodge for nine years, said the lodge was seen by people in nearby villages as a good place to work and learn new skills. He said many tourists were impressed by the lodge\u2019s picturesque setting and proximity to traditional farming. \u201cThey don\u2019t have rice fields like this in their countries,\u201d he said.Fredo Binh first visited the Vu Linh commune in 1996, when it was just a cluster of traditional stilt houses with rice paddies, eucalyptus trees and a tranquil lake.Bho Hoong villagers are from the Co Tu minority group, and Active Adventures Vietnam, the local company behind the business, markets the lodge as an authentic experience with a \u201cmodern twist\u201d: The five bungalows have contemporary amenities like king-size beds and marble-accented bathrooms. As the country becomes more of a mainstream destination catering to mid-range and high-end travelers, more clients \u201cwant the experience but don\u2019t want to rough it,\u201d said Mark Wyndham, the managing director of Active Adventures Travel Vietnam.Guests can enjoy treks and ethnic music performances by villagers, but the project\u2019s most important achievement, Mr. Wyndham said, is generating extra income for locals that may help preserve traditional cultures or reduce pressure on young people to migrate to the cities. \u201cIt\u2019s, in a sense, trying to hold back a bit of globalization,\u201d he said.The project is more than just a business. It was created in coordination with the provincial authorities and the International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency that provided technical assistance and $50,000 in initial funding, said Nguyen Thi Huyen, national coordinator for the agency\u2019s sustainable and responsible tourism program. Ms. Huyen said her office viewed public-private tourism partnerships as a promising model that could spread beyond Bho Hoong to other Vietnamese regions.At La Vie Vu Linh, Mr. Binh\u2019s efforts do not just provide Dao villagers with jobs and tourists with somewhere to sleep at 1.2 million dong, or $55, a night, or less, for a private room. He has also recruited teachers to give his employees lessons in English, French, hospitality, theater and even circus arts. (Before moving to Vietnam in the 1990s, Mr. Binh managed a traveling circus camp in Ireland.) He said he also planned to open a floating fruit and vegetable market on the lake to promote sustainable agriculture in Vu Linh.Tuong Van Thuong, a villager, said the lodge benefits the local economy and has helped promote and protect Dao culture. He said he and several other neighbors were operating their own homestay businesses.Antoine Colmet-Daage, a French graduate student, visited La Vie Vu Linh in 2013, as part of a weeklong motorcycle tour of northern Vietnam. He said he enjoyed learning about Mr. Binh\u2019s farming projects and noted that the modern comforts and tranquil setting were a relief after long days of riding bumpy roads on a motorcycle.He added that he was surprised to find that he and a friend were the only guests. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand how a place like that could be so empty,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from Toulouse, France.On a recent afternoon at La Vie Vu Linh, the premises were again all but empty, except for Mr. Binh, his wife and a few of the lodge\u2019s 15 employees. Mr. Binh acknowledged that he did not advertise \u2014 most of his bookings are made through travel agencies or international schools seeking cultural immersion programs.He has not recouped his initial investments, including about $350,000 for structures that accommodate as many as 80 guests, and $6,000 for solar heaters and water filtration and biogas-capture systems. The expense \u201calmost killed my company,\u201d he said with a laugh, referring to his motorcycle touring business. Mr. Binh hopes that he will break even in two years and that the recent opening of a highway between Hanoi and the Chinese border \u2014 Vu Linh lies slightly more than 100 miles from each \u2014 may increase bookings. But he was quick to add that La Vie Vu Linh is not a hotel but a project that blends tourism, ecologically conscious agriculture and long-term education for his employees. \u201cIt\u2019s a stool with three legs,\u201d Mr. Binh said, sitting cross-legged in a stilt house overlooking the lake. \u201cRemove one and it falls down.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A French Politician Who Has Helped Refine the National Front Party", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileST.-MACAIRE-EN-MAGUES, France \u2014 Florian Philippot was about to take the stage in this small western village in the hope of lifting the fortunes of the local candidates of the far-right National Front party.\u201cAs if our supporters were weeds,\u201d he said with a huff. \u201cMaybe he would do better to think more about how to yank voters off the unemployment rolls.\u201dThe line is an example of why some in France have called Mr. Philippot, who at 33 is the National Front\u2019s vice president in charge of communications and strategy, the \u201cargument machine.\u201d Experts give Mr. Philippot credit for much of the party\u2019s success so far, saying he has been critical in its efforts to present a respectable face \u2014 and one that is ready to govern.He told the crowd here that he had come to support the local candidates in Sunday\u2019s departmental elections (a layer of government between county and regional) because it is a corner of \u201cforgotten France,\u201d but a corner that the National Front still cares about. That line, too, won him applause.RIGHT-LEANING parties \u2014 the mainstream conservative Union for a Popular Movement party, or UMP, as well as the National Front \u2014 are expected to do well. But analysts doubt it will be a breakthrough election for them, though the UMP may face runoffs with the National Front in a number of second-round elections.These days, the French actually hear more from Mr. Philippot, who is a constant presence on television talk shows, than they do from Ms. Le Pen.It is not hard to see why he is such a popular guest. He is a graduate of one of France\u2019s elite business schools as well as its \u00c9cole Nationale d\u2019Administration, known as ENA, which has trained most French politicians, including Mr. Hollande, and he appears indestructible on television.Like the front-row student who always has his hand up, he sits, neatly groomed, on the edge of his chair, happily jousting with panels of gray-haired experts who mean to portray his party as dangerously extreme. But more often than not they are flummoxed by Mr. Philippot\u2019s intellectual agility.RECENTLY, he was mocking the French economy minister\u2019s latest reforms, which are largely a collection of small-bore items such as letting more stores stay open on Sundays and developing more bus routes between towns. Mr. Philippot scoffed at the notion that new bus routes might be called progress.\u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d said Mr. Philippot, rolling his eyes. \u201cRickshaws?\u201dWhen the National Front was led by Mr. Le Pen, it was seen as a marginal party of racist and anti-Semitic old men. He made his ideas heard during presidential election years, but never did the groundwork to build a functioning party.Mr. Philippot said he has only expanded on Ms. Le Pen\u2019s ideas, helping her develop party policy on a broad range of issues, including education and economics. Her father, he said, spent far too much time on his trademark anti-immigrant discourse.\u201cHe only talked about immigration,\u201d Mr. Philippot said. \u201cA political party should be able to speak on all subjects.\u201dHe describes his first meeting with Ms. Le Pen in 2009 as a kind of political love at first sight. A friend had arranged a dinner party, knowing that Mr. Philippot was intrigued. By the end of the night, Ms. Le Pen has said, they were finishing each other\u2019s sentences.\u201cFrom the beginning we connected both on a human and a political level,\u201d Mr. Philippot said, adding, \u201cI was attracted to her energy, her dynamism, her courage.\u201d And, he said, the National Front was a party that would allow young people a place at the table.IN public, Mr. Philippot is rousing. His message is that France needs to stop being ashamed of its history. It needs to renegotiate its treaty with the European Union, and restore its currency and its borders. Schools need to spend more time teaching the French language. On the economy, protectionism is the way to go.The audience applauded often, and happily stood with him at the end to sing the national anthem.Mr. Philippot has less charisma in one-on-one situations. He smiles little and looks awkward when he has to shake hands with people after his speech. While he campaigned to be mayor of a small town last year, aides reportedly had to continually remind him to greet people on the street and make small talk.He fell short in that contest but won a seat on the City Council, and went on to win a seat in the European Parliament a few months later. He makes no secret of his ambitions. He expects a ministerial position if Ms. Le Pen wins the presidency. \u201cWhich job is up to her,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want an active role in the executive, yes.\u201dMr. Philippot\u2019s rise in the party has been meteoric. He officially joined the National Front in 2010, and was named to his post in the wake of the party\u2019s 2012 results, when it took nearly 18 percent of the vote in the first round, more than ever before. He had campaigned only once before, as a university student in 2002 for a candidate who garnered only 5 percent of the vote.Mr. Philippot was born in the north of France near Lille, where deindustrialization has fed pockets of strong support for the National Front. His father is the principal of a public school, and he shrugs when asked if his father agrees with his politics, saying that the family gets along well.

{"Headline": "Ukraine President Dismisses Billionaire Ally From Governor\u2019s Role", "Date": "2015-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 In the latest move in a dispute that has threatened to fracture Ukraine\u2019s government, President Petro O. Poroshenko early Wednesday dismissed the billionaire governor of Dnipropetrovsk, an important industrial region that has been a bulwark against the advances of pro-Russian separatists.The ousted governor, Igor V. Kolomoisky, had been one of the government\u2019s staunchest allies, and his privately financed militias had helped stop pro-Russian fighters from moving beyond the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where they have been waging war for nearly a year.Masked, armed men, apparently loyal to Mr. Kolomoisky, occupied the offices of one company, Ukrnafta, in Kiev, the capital, late last week. The seizure of the building unsettled Kiev, which has remained peaceful since February 2014, when about 100 people were killed during mass protests that ultimately ousted the president, Viktor F. Yanukovych.Critics of Mr. Kolomoisky, including some prominent Ukrainian lawmakers, accused him of blocking reforms and had called for his dismissal.His removal was announced in a middle-of-the-night statement by Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s office, apparently after a meeting between the men. The statement said that Mr. Poroshenko had received the governor\u2019s resignation and had signed a decree removing him from the governor\u2019s post.\u201cWe have to ensure peace, stability and tranquillity,\u201d Mr. Poroshenko said in the statement. \u201cDnipropetrovsk region should remain a bastion of Ukraine in the east, to protect peace.\u201dThe statement said that Valentyn Reznichenko, who last month was named governor of the neighboring region of Zaporizhia, would be the acting governor in Dnipropetrovsk. Mr. Reznichenko had ran a government agency overseeing Ukraine\u2019s radio frequencies and has business ties to the president\u2019s chief of staff.Dnipropetrovsk, which also borders Donetsk, is widely viewed as the country\u2019s most important industrial region.Just days ago, in an interview on the 1+1 television channel, which he owns, Mr. Kolomoisky suggested that a compromise had been reached with Mr. Poroshenko. But on Monday, the director of the Ukrainian state security service said that Mr. Poroshenko had ordered the arrest of any armed men remaining in Ukrnafta\u2019s offices.The breach between Mr. Poroshenko and Mr. Kolomoisky could have far-reaching ramifications. On Tuesday, there were reports that private militia forces had disappeared from the streets of Odessa, in southeastern Ukraine, where they had been helping to maintain order.How Russia aims to achieve its goal of keeping Ukraine isolated from the West.Critics of the militias have long warned that they could easily turn against the government in Kiev. And Mr. Poroshenko had said that he would take steps to incorporate private militias like those controlled by Mr. Kolomoisky into Ukraine\u2019s military.The governor in Odessa is Ihor Palytsia, an ally of Mr. Kolomoisky, who had served as an executive of Ukrnafta.In a separate statement, the presidential administration announced that Mr. Poroshenko had signed into law a bill adopted last week by Parliament that set off the dispute with Mr. Kolomoisky.The law effectively reduced the power of Mr. Kolomoisky\u2019s minority stake in the state-controlled energy companies, depriving him of the ability to block management changes.Supporters of the law said that it was needed to prevent murky arrangements between the government and the country\u2019s richest business leaders that have hobbled the country\u2019s economy for years.In a statement, Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s office said the bill signed by the president \u201cbrings the legislation of Ukraine to international standards.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Budget Office Again Reduces Its Estimate on Cost of the Affordable Care Act", "Date": "2015-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust since January, the budget office said, it has reduced its estimate of the 10-year cost of federal insurance subsidies by 20 percent, and its estimate of new Medicaid costs attributable to the law has come down by 8 percent.Slower growth in health spending helps consumers and businesses, which shoulder most of the costs, and contributes to lower federal budget deficits.The budget office now projects deficits totaling $7.2 trillion from 2016 to 2025, a decrease of 6 percent from the more than $7.6 trillion projected in January.\u201cThe largest factor underlying that reduction is a downward revision in projected growth in premiums for private health insurance,\u201d reflecting the fact that spending by private insurers in 2013 rose less than in preceding years and much less than expected, the budget office said in a new report.The new estimates could help Democrats stave off Republican efforts to roll back the law. Even though millions of people have gained coverage, opinion polls show that unfavorable views of the law are still more common than favorable ones.\u201cUnrestrained growth in health care costs did pose a threat to our government\u2019s finances\u201d and contributed to \u201csome weakness in our economy,\u201d Mr. Earnest said, and he asserted that the law was reversing those trends.The budget office has repeatedly lowered its estimate of the cost of the health care law since the bill was signed by President Obama in March 2010. At that time, the budget office said that the law\u2019s insurance-related provisions would cost the federal government $710 billion from 2015 through 2019, the last year of the 10-year projection period used then. On Monday, Douglas W. Elmendorf, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the new projections indicated that \u201cthe cost will be $506 billion for that same period, a reduction of 29 percent.\u201dMuch of the reduction can be attributed to the subsidies. Five years ago the budget office predicted that people receiving financial assistance through health insurance exchanges would receive subsidies averaging $5,200 a person in 2015. On Monday, it said that subsidies this year would average $3,960 for each person receiving assistance.The budget office now estimates that the federal government will spend a total of $849 billion on insurance subsidies in the coming decade \u2014 $209 billion or 20 percent less than it estimated in January of this year.With premiums rising more slowly, fewer health plans will have to pay a new excise tax on high-cost insurance, which takes effect in 2018. Projected revenues from the so-called Cadillac tax from 2018 to 2025 have plunged more than 40 percent.But at the same time, the budget office said, the government will collect more in payroll and income taxes, because workers will get more of their compensation in taxable wages and less in tax-free fringe benefits like employer-sponsored health insurance.The budget office made small changes in its estimates of insurance coverage for the coming decade. It said that fewer people would lose employment-based coverage, and fewer would gain coverage through public insurance marketplaces and Medicaid. In addition, it said, somewhat fewer people will remain uninsured \u2014 24 million in 2017-19, compared with its earlier estimate of 26 million.Mr. Elmendorf estimated that new federal Medicaid costs resulting from the health care law would total $847 billion in the coming decade, down $73 billion or 8 percent from the agency\u2019s estimate in January.The budget office sounded a cautionary note about premiums for health plans sold on the exchanges. In general, it said, these plans have been paying doctors and hospitals less than employer-sponsored plans, and they have held down costs by limiting consumers\u2019 choice of providers.\u201cMany plans will not be able to sustain such low provider payment rates or such narrow networks over the next few years,\u201d and this will put \u201cupward pressure\u201d on premiums in the exchanges, the budget office predicted.After six years running the budget office, Mr. Elmendorf plans to step down next month, to be replaced by Keith Hall, who was the commissioner of labor statistics from January 2008 to January 2012.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Singapore Story", "Date": "2015-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSINGAPORE \u2014 An hour or so after the end of the funeral ceremony at the National University of Singapore, the crowds were only just beginning to thin out. Earlier, despite torrential downpours, they had stood six-deep in some stretches of the 10-mile route of the procession accompanying Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s coffin. It was a last homage in a week of homages and an intense outpouring of national grief.At times, the wall-to-wall TV, radio and social media coverage \u2014 on Singapore\u2019s 50th anniversary and a year before elections \u2014 also felt like a reminder to the country\u2019s younger, sometimes disgruntled, generation that it should not take Singapore\u2019s remarkable successes for granted.Last Wednesday, throngs of mourners queued up near Parliament House to see Mr. Lee\u2019s body lying in state. It was early afternoon when I arrived, and blistering hot. As I was trying to find the starting point of the line \u2014 the wait by then was estimated to be eight hours \u2014 I fell into conversation with a young couple in office attire. The two had taken time off work to pay their respects, and were watching on their phones old news footage showing the legendary prime minister guiding Singapore through the stormy waters of independence from Britain, through its union with and then separation from Malaysia, through its makings into a modern financial powerhouse. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s so much of history, we just forget,\u2019\u2019 the woman said.Much of the TV coverage was devoted to the 1950s and 1960s, a period of tumultuous politics after the collapse of colonialism in Southeast Asia. Channel NewsAsia repeatedly broadcast ravishing portraits from that era, with extracts of Mr. Lee\u2019s most famous speeches. It was a hypnotic loop of images \u2014 of social unrest and ferocious political battles, all a far cry from today\u2019s immaculate, orderly Singapore.Some of the most riveting segments were Mr. Lee\u2019s series of \u2018\u2018Battle for Merger\u2019\u2019 radio speeches from the early 1960s, in which he set out his case for Singapore\u2019s union with Malaysia: He believed that joining forces with a far larger, resource-rich country with a shared culture and history was the logical way forward for the small and newly independent island. Mr. Lee came across by turns as forceful, cajoling, even humorous \u2014 a highly persuasive combination, and largely unfamiliar to many young Singaporeans today, who tend to see him as an authoritarian figure.Again and again we also saw this segment of news archive: the painful announcement, at a famous press conference in 1965, that Singapore would in fact separate from Malaysia. Mr. Lee is shown saying that this is \u2018\u2018a moment of anguish.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018You see, the whole of my adult life,\u2019\u2019 he adds, dabbing his eyes with a handkerchief, \u2018\u2018I have believed in Malaysian merger and the unity of these two territories.\u2019\u2019It is a remarkable sight, high in political and human drama; it captures all the fragility and defiance of one man and a new nation.Looking at the footage now, half a century later, this moment seems all the more extraordinary because that political failure also marked the beginning of Singapore\u2019s glittering success. Cast adrift and expected soon to collapse, the island then set out to transform itself, and under the stewardship of Mr. Lee and his party it soon became one of the most determinedly modern cities in the world. Singaporeans born in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s grew up amid unprecedented growth and stability, with the economy expanding at such a rate that by 2013 the country\u2019s G.D.P. per capita exceeded that of any country in Asia \u2014 and that of Britain, France and Germany.Today these figures seem to get lost on the young; disgruntlement has seeped into the cracks of prosperity. Growth has slowed down, and the average university graduate faces fierce competition for jobs and a far longer wait to buy an apartment in low-cost government housing, for decades the bedrock of homeownership. In 2013 a government White Paper outlining its plans for immigration and population growth set off street protests, an exceptional show of public dissatisfaction in a usually placid society.Facing an uncertain future, some younger Singaporeans seem nostalgic for a past of easy plenty. The website iremember.sg commemorates everyday symbols of a pre-millennium life that are slowly disappearing, like neighborhood playgrounds and kopitiam, the once-ubiquitous traditional coffee shops now under threat from commercial chains. In the hipster enclave of Tiong Bahru, 20-somethings in batik shirts and horn-rimmed glasses gather in cafes with bare concrete floors and marble-top tables.This past week, Singapore commemorated Mr. Lee by reliving the heady, optimistic days of 1960s politics. At the same time, it was reminding its citizens, especially the young, that its transformation from backwater to economic powerhouse should continue to be a cause for celebration and gratitude.Tash Aw is the author of three novels, including, most recently, \u2018\u2018Five Star Billionaire.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To See Ukraine\u2019s Future, Recall Crimea", "Date": "2015-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 Just over a year ago, Russia annexed Crimea in the first major land grab in Europe since World War II. The world has paid little attention to Crimea since then, but developments on the Black Sea peninsula provide fearsome insights into both the folly of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, in Ukraine and his campaign of intimidation against Russia\u2019s near neighbors.Over the past 15 years, Mr. Putin has built a system in Russia in which opposition voices are silenced, individual rights are trampled on, freedom of expression is restricted, organized crime is rampant and property rights are arbitrarily enforced. Since Russia annexed Crimea, Mr. Putin has imported the same grotesque mode of governance to the peninsula.Many of the so-called self-defense forces that sprang up a year ago, alongside Mr. Putin\u2019s \u201clittle green men\u201d (as the unmarked Russian armed forces are colloquially known), were the foot soldiers of Crimea\u2019s criminal gangs. The region\u2019s elite has long had a close relationship with organized crime. Various news organizations have reported that Mr. Putin\u2019s handpicked leader in Crimea, Sergei V. Aksyonov, was known in mafia circles as \u201cthe Goblin\u201d in the 1990s. (Mr. Aksyonov has denied links to organized crime.)According to Mark Galeotti, a professor of global affairs at New York University, \u201cMany of the burly and well-armed \u2018self-defense volunteers\u2019 who came out on the streets alongside the not-officially Russian troops turned out to be local gangsters.\u201d Over the last year, many have been drafted into a quasi-policing role in Crimea, their paramilitary units renamed the \u201cpeople\u2019s militia.\u201dSince last March, this force has conducted a series of raids and property seizures. Immediately after annexation, Russia swiftly assumed control of several Ukrainian state-owned industrial interests; it soon shifted its focus to private enterprises. In August, the headquarters of Zaliv, Crimea\u2019s largest civilian shipbuilder, were stormed, as part of a campaign to force the management to hand over control to a Moscow-based company. According to estimates from local sources, the total value of losses accrued as a result of real estate and other asset expropriation in Crimea is more than $1 billion.As part of this, Crimea\u2019s authorities forced Ukrainian banks operating on the peninsula to close, including those belonging to Igor V. Kolomoisky, the pro-Kiev governor of Dnipropetrovsk in eastern Ukraine. In their place, Russian ones have moved in \u2014 among them, the Russian National Commercial Bank. According to The Moscow Times, Crimean authorities acquired this little-known subsidiary of the Bank of Moscow \u201cjust weeks after Russia seized the peninsula. They then presided over its growth from one of the country\u2019s smallest banks to become Crimea\u2019s largest bank.\u201dThe Kremlin has seized control of the peninsula\u2019s media, taking Ukrainian TV channels off the air and replacing them with state-backed Russian ones. In August, Crimea\u2019s authorities raided the independent Chernomorska broadcaster, impounding its equipment and computers, and sealing off its building. Elsewhere, journalists have been pressured to toe the Kremlin\u2019s line. According to Kyiv Post, an English-language newspaper, the Ukraine-based Center for Investigative Journalism recorded 85 incidents of harassment and censorship against reporters in Crimea during March 2014 alone.Human Rights Watch has reported that the peninsula\u2019s pro-Russian paramilitary groups are implicated in the disappearance of a number of pro-Ukrainian activists. In March, Andriy Shekun and Anatoly Kovalksy were abducted from a train station in Simferopol, Crimea\u2019s capital, and held for 11 days in detention where they were beaten and shot at with low-velocity handguns (designed to cause trauma but not kill). Mr. Shekun was subjected to electric shocks on two occasions, according to the rights group.The people who have borne the worst of Russia\u2019s annexation are Crimea\u2019s native Tatars. Since March, several Tatar activists have been abducted, some of them killed \u2014 including Reshat Ametov, who was detained during a Simferopol protest in March, and was later found murdered. Two of the community\u2019s most prominent leaders, Mustafa Dzhemilev and Refat Chubarov, have been barred by Crimea\u2019s authorities from entering the peninsula. In September, Russian security forces raided the headquarters of the Mejlis, the Tatars\u2019 representative body, as well as the home of one of its members, Eskender Bariev.Institutions that are not explicitly pro-Russian are also regularly targeted for intimidation and harassment. Ukrainian-language teaching has disappeared from school curriculums, while the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, most of which broke away from Russian Orthodoxy in the early 1990s, has been forced to close 11 of its 18 parishes.America\u2019s assistant secretary of state for the region, Victoria Nuland, said at a congressional hearing this month that as a result of Russia\u2019s actions, Crimea was \u201csuffering a reign of terror.\u201d She was right.Condemned in the West a year ago as a flagrant breach of international law, Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea has fallen down the international agenda as the situation in Ukraine has evolved. Western diplomacy has focused instead on trying to stop a deterioration of the situation in southeastern Ukraine. Yet the West should take a careful look at what is happening in Crimea: The fate of the annexed peninsula could very likely prefigure what is in store for the secessionist Donetsk and Luhansk people\u2019s republics.In January, the European Council\u2019s president, Donald Tusk, appeared to accuse some European Union leaders of favoring a policy of \u201cappeasement\u201d with Russia, and warned against any watering down of economic sanctions. But the fact that Crimea was not mentioned in either of the cease-fire deals known as Minsk I, signed last September, or Minsk II, agreed to in February, is a form of appeasement in itself. That Western countries are highly unlikely to grant official recognition to Russia\u2019s control over Crimea does nothing to change this.The fear in Western capitals last year was that Crimea might be only the first of many land grabs planned by Mr. Putin against Russia\u2019s near neighbors. And so it has proved.Last week, Russia violated Georgia\u2019s sovereignty when it signed an accord with the leadership of South Ossetia, integrating the breakaway republic with Russia. This followed the signing last year of a similar agreement with Abkhazia, another breakaway region of Georgia. In Moldova, meanwhile, the Kremlin continues to tolerate corruption and criminality as the engine of Transnistria\u2019s economy, and to block progress by the country\u2019s reform-minded government.If the West is serious about halting the growth of a Russian regime that poses a threat to the citizens not only of Russia and Ukraine but also elsewhere, it must begin by remembering that Crimea matters.Andrew Foxall is the director of the Russia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society, an international affairs think tank.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Sanctions on Russia Will Backfire", "Date": "2015-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe American government tends to see sanctions against Russia as a low-cost policy that will eventually force Vladimir Putin to change course in Ukraine. But this conventional wisdom obscures significant costs. Just as using drones to target suspected terrorists in Pakistan may have created more converts to Islamic militancy than it has eliminated, sanctions advocates haven\u2019t reckoned with the unintended consequences of the policy \u2014 consequences that could prove far more damaging to American interests than the Kremlin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine. First, by employing commercial and financial sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine, the United States \u2014 the architect and largest beneficiary of the globalized system of trade and finance \u2014 is exploiting post-Soviet Russia\u2019s integration into that system. Years of mutually beneficial progress that brought 140 million Russians into the orbit of global economic governance are now in doubt. Even if sanctions succeed in changing the Kremlin\u2019s behavior and are then lifted, the American objective of integrating Russia into the global economy has been fundamentally undermined. Second, the use of sanctions broadcasts to others the strategic hazard of integrating into the American-led global financial system. Whatever the outcome of Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine and whatever Mr. Putin\u2019s ultimate fate, other non-allies of the United States have now learned the lesson that hard-won institutional integration can be turned against those states that achieve it. Third, while there is no question that sanctions have inflicted real costs on the leading state-owned and state-affiliated companies and harmed Mr. Putin\u2019s cronies, the collateral damage to independent, private enterprise in Russia is incomparably worse. Businesses without political protection will see atrophied sales, no access to finance and an indefinite postponement of investment. Those enterprises that put the greatest store on Russia\u2019s integration with the European Union and the United States are being hit hardest. (One of us is an American investor and entrepreneur who has long been active in Russia and is witnessing this first-hand.) The most daring Westernizers among Russia\u2019s small entrepreneurial class now find themselves without protection while state banks and energy companies continue to be shielded by their access to government credit obtained on favorable terms. Fourth, by imposing sanctions on Russia when it was already falling into a downward economic spiral, Washington has given Mr. Putin a powerful political instrument to deflect blame for the consequences of his own baleful decisions in Ukraine. The Kremlin\u2019s model of \u201cstate capitalism\u201d was already struggling and its performance would have been poor without the geopolitical upheaval that Mr. Putin has created. American sanctions arrived with perfect timing, providing him an alibi that he has skillfully used to confuse the Russian people about the cause of their economic woes. Fifth, even if sanctions are carefully crafted to punish specific actors, ordinary Russians perceive the West\u2019s sanctions to be directed against them and it is they who are being forced to bear the real costs of soaring inflation, the ruble\u2019s collapse and slowing growth. Russians\u2019 sense that they are under attack has generated an understandable \u201crallying around the flag\u201d phenomenon. Mr. Putin\u2019s all-time-high approval ratings are one result; the other is the near-complete marginalization of dissenting voices. Sadly, Sunday\u2019s march to memorialize the slain opposition leader, Boris Nemtsov, will not change this. If Russia faces greater economic turbulence in the coming months and years, America could face far more intractable problems than those that exist today. Russia is likely to become more belligerent if externally inflicted economic blows deepen the country\u2019s crisis. Moreover, a deeper downturn in Russia would worsen the economic woes of the European Union, with potential knock-on effects globally. Now that Washington has made sanctions the centerpiece of its response to Russia, President Obama cannot simply abandon them. Instead, he should use them as leverage to negotiate a comprehensive settlement, one that involves some give and take. The first round of sanctions made sense. With its annexation of Crimea, Russia not only trampled over key international norms, but also cemented an egregious violation for decades to come. The United States had to demonstrate that such violations incur costs to avoid allowing Russia to set a dangerous precedent. Targeted, Crimea-specific sanctions that prevent Russia from profiting from annexation should still serve that purpose. Russia has undoubtedly violated international norms in eastern Ukraine too. But unlike in Crimea, it could feasibly return to compliance there in the near future. And more sanctions won\u2019t alter Russia\u2019s broader strategic objectives in its backyard. Many policy makers privately admit this, but they respond by asking, \u201cWhat else could we have done?\u201d It\u2019s a fair question. Since no feasible coercive measures could have prevented Mr. Putin from supporting the insurgency in eastern Ukraine, the only choice was, and remains, to negotiate \u2014 both to limit the suffering the Kremlin can inflict on defenseless populations and to avoid a wider, more dangerous Cold War-like confrontation. But talks covering Ukraine alone, like the ones in Minsk last month, will at best produce a temporary cease-fire in the conflict between Russia and the West. Only a broader agreement on regional security can end this conflict definitively. And sanctions relief can be used as a bargaining chip to get a deal that will stick.The alternative would be open-ended sanctions that escalate conflict between Washington and Moscow while influencing Russia\u2019s economy and politics in ways that contradict American interests. Mr. Putin would gain greater control over the economy and rally the public around him, and Russia\u2019s evolution as a modern, globally integrated country would be halted. Recognizing these risks is not an endorsement of Russia\u2019s aggressive behavior. Just as opposing drone strikes doesn\u2019t imply support for terrorism, highlighting the strategic costs of sanctions is about crafting an effective policy, not appeasing Mr. Putin. It is worth recalling that after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States faced a nightmare scenario of Russia in chaos. The government was bankrupt, and its ability to control its territory and large nuclear arsenal was threatened. At that time, Washington concluded that such a weak Russia would pose a grave threat to American national security. Why should that calculation be any different today?Advertisement"}

In a truly strong job market, those racial gaps would be narrower because the competition for workers would drive joblessness down for minorities, who are the hardest hit in hard times. Another sign of weakness is stagnant wage growth. In a stronger job market, competition for labor would push up wages as it pulled down unemployment. But wages have barely budged throughout the nearly six-year-old recovery. Ignoring these signs of weakness would be foolish, and yet the new report has stirred talk that the Federal Reserve will see the falling jobless rate as a sign of strength that justifies an imminent interest-rate increase. That would be a mistake, however, because raising rates in the near term would lock in high unemployment among minorities and wage stagnation.The goal of monetary policy is to set rates low enough to foster job growth and high enough to control inflation. In the past, the Fed has indicated that an unemployment rate around 5.4 percent would be consistent with holding inflation to a target rate of 2 percent on average. Both the jobless rate and the inflation rate are getting closer to the benchmarks the Fed has set for initiating rate increases. But there are problems with those targets. The reason the Fed associates falling unemployment with rising inflation is that, theoretically, more hiring leads to higher wages that, in turn, lead to consumer demand for goods and services, pushing up prices. In practice, it has been several decades since those relationships have held \u2014 in part, because the Fed has usually been too quick to raise rates when wages have started to rise. This has led to a long-term decline in the share of income that goes to worker pay and a long-term increase in the share that goes to stockholders and executives. The Fed should hold off until wages are growing in tandem with inflation and productivity. In the meantime, it should use its regulatory tools to ensure that low-interest-rate credit is put to productive uses and not speculative bubbles. Of course, Congress should do its part for job creation and economic growth \u2014 say, by financing infrastructure projects. Its inability to act is yet another reason the Fed has to get its response right. Advertisement"}

It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.\u201dNearly half a century later, that disconnect is coming to a head. Economic growth, even where it looks impressive, seems to be creating fewer jobs than in the past, and for the most part, poorly paid ones. The main metrics for economic success now appear to be decoupling from labor markets, the main source of income and meaning for citizens.Nouriel Roubini, a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University, underlined the point last week at a London conference on the future of work. \u201cThe share of labor in the economy is collapsing, and that will continue,\u201d he said.Some speak of a third industrial revolution; others call it the second machine age. With the processing speed of computers doubling roughly every 18 months and machines becoming ever smarter, paid work for human beings could become a lot scarcer \u2014 and soon.Forty-seven percent of all employment in the United States is susceptible to automation over the next two decades, according to a study by Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist, and Michael A. Osborne, an associate professor of machine learning, at the University of Oxford. It is not just truck drivers and tax preparers who risk losing their jobs, economists say. Robots can pick strawberries, distinguishing the ripe ones by taking hundreds of digital photographs a second, and algorithms apparently make more objective court decisions than human judges, who according to a study in Israel are more lenient after a food break.This hyperdigital age is also creating some new jobs for humans. Among the 10 fastest-growing job descriptions identified by Dr. Frey were big data architect and iOS developer. But over all, he said, \u201cIt seems that job creation is not going to keep pace with automation.\u201dIf so, the disruption will run deep. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t a job for every citizen, then what does it mean to be a citizen?\u201d asked Ngaire Woods, professor of global economic governance at Oxford. Dr. Woods was among those who mulled an idea developed by the American economist Milton Friedman of a negative income tax or basic income, an unconditional sum of public money that would help those displaced from the labor market.Jeremy Rifkin, author of \u201cThe Third Industrial Revolution,\u201d said a basic income would enable people to volunteer their time in areas like elder care, child care, culture and the environment.\u201cThis is not a utopia, it\u2019s a practical business plan for the next step of the human journey,\u201d Mr. Rifkin said.Laura Tyson, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, said the Nordic countries, with their flexible labor markets and generous social safety nets, could be a model.

{"Headline": "Struggling Mumbai Developers Turn to Gimmicks", "Date": "2015-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside AsiaMUMBAI, India \u2014 India\u2019s debt-laden property developers are turning to deep discounts, free parking spots and even gimmicks like gifts of gold coins and motorbikes as they struggle to sell billions of dollars worth of as-yet unfinished homes.Now outstripping China as the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy according to official data, India has a real estate market mired in debt piled up in a 2006-7 construction boom that gave way to a slowdown.It now takes developers about four and a half years to turn property inventory into cash, more than a full year longer than it takes developers in China, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine data.That figure is not just bad news for developers in megacities like Mumbai, now seeking ways to offload inventory with increasing intensity. Many debt-burdened lenders are also finding it harder to pass on interest rate cuts to borrowers, hindering central bank efforts to accelerate growth. India\u2019s central bank has decreased rates twice this year, with more reductions expected.\u201cIt is a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d said Preeti Patil, 28, who works for a large Indian media group and was in the market for a two-bedroom house in the suburbs of Mumbai. \u201cLast week, we turned down a deal. Two days later, we had the builder call us to offer an $8-per-square-foot discount.\u201dEven worse for developers, Ms. Patil is among those who have little confidence that property prices are set to rise. Despite cut-price offers, she abandoned plans to buy, saying she feared that the investment would not reap near-term returns.Offers of gold coins \u2014 prized in Indian culture \u2014 motorbikes and even iPhones have begun to feature in developers\u2019 advertising in recent weeks, prospective buyers say. Although it is too early to say whether such tactics will be enough to reel in upwardly mobile professionals and members of the newly wealthy middle class, demand for scores of empty, or under-construction, high-end residences remains flat.At the brokerage firm Kotak Securities, analysts estimate that unsold inventory held by a group of leading Mumbai developers alone now stands at about 534 billion rupees, $8.6 billion \u2014 with an additional 368 billion rupees worth of projects in the pipeline.That puts the current, unsold area in Mumbai at almost the value of the total sold in the 2014 calendar year. The backlog, analysts estimate, could take more than a decade to clear.\u201cThe overall market has slowed down in the last two years,\u201d said Niranjan Hiranandani, managing director of the privately held developer Hiranandani Constructions. \u201cOverall demand has gone down.\u201d Mr. Hiranandani\u2019s own 500-acre residential project in Navi Mumbai, a new suburb east of the city, is gearing up for construction after being stalled for more than two years and does not have a completion date. Mr. Hiranandani declined to provide figures for his company\u2019s inventory, but he said he was comfortable with its position.Issues ranging from a lack of approvals, a cash crunch and low demand mean several other Mumbai projects by developers such as Indiabulls Real Estate and DB Realty have also slowed or stalled. Demand has been squeezed in part by Mumbai residential property prices, which have more than doubled between 2009 and 2012.Part of the trouble is the excess supply of premium homes. Although developers built houses to be sold at price tags of more than $160,000, the huge bulk of demand is in the range of $8,000 to $32,000, said Akhilesh Tilotia, an analyst at Kotak Securities.Pankaj Kapoor, the chief executive of Liases Foras, a real estate rating and research firm, said, \u201cOn one side, there\u2019s a housing shortage, and on another you have rising inventory, and that\u2019s a very big paradox.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In China, a Building Frenzy\u2019s Fault Lines", "Date": "2015-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBillions poured into Chinese real estate, and big foreign financial firms hunted for the next hit \u2014 the small bet that investors could ride to great heights. One of those firms, Credit Suisse, scoured the landscape and in 2007 discovered Kaisa, a relatively small property developer in Shenzhen that mostly bought and rehabilitated distressed properties. Credit Suisse brokered a $300 million investment deal for Kaisa, and two years later, it went public. Its chairman, Guo Yingcheng, posed for photographs on the floor of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange holding a statue of a bull, which seemed to signify hopes for his company\u2019s coming bull run. His colleagues poured Champagne into an ice sculpture of the company\u2019s stock code: 1638.With the $450 million raised in the initial public offering, Kaisa embarked on an aggressive expansion into 20 more cities. It formed a partnership with Marriott hotels and announced plans to build one of the world\u2019s tallest buildings. Kaisa shares skyrocketed, helping lift the fortunes of its Western patrons, including the Carlyle Group, an American private equity firm.Then came the fall.The real estate market slumped, dragging down the rest of the Chinese economy. Developers, in particular, were under pressure, as foreign investment dried up.And in this market tumult, reports surfaced late last year that Kaisa\u2019s chairman was being questioned in a corruption case. With little explanation, in December, Shenzhen authorities blocked Kaisa from selling homes at several major residential developments.Soon after, Mr. Guo, the chairman, resigned \u201cdue to health reasons.\u201d A string of resignations followed that wiped out virtually the entire senior management team, including the chief executive, chief financial officer and the head of investor relations.The chairman\u2019s family bailed out of the company in February, agreeing to sell its 49 percent stake to a Chinese developer for $580 million, a small fraction of its value just months earlier.Stock investors got burned as Kaisa\u2019s share price fell 55 percent in just a few months. The developer had also tapped the debt markets, selling $2.5 billion worth of bonds overseas to big fund management companies like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments.Kaisa is now pushing such bondholders to accept roughly 50 percent of the value of their holdings, or risk getting pennies on the dollar if the company goes bankrupt.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen problems with other developers, but nothing like this,\u201d said Peter Churchouse, a property consultant in Hong Kong and a former executive with Morgan Stanley. \u201cThere\u2019s a deep mystery here.\u201dThe Kaisa story offers an unusual window into what can go wrong when investors rush headlong into China. In a country where the profits have been so tempting, the warning signs \u2014 the complex corporate structures, the opaque deals, the political influence \u2014 often go unheeded. Investors, even sophisticated investors, either miss them or ignore them.The Chinese authorities have offered no reason for their decision to freeze sales at Kaisa properties. And the company\u2019s executives are not talking. But there were hints. Reports of bribery. Insider deals involving more than a dozen of the chairman\u2019s relatives. An increasingly complex network of affiliated companies. And a land development project tied to a former Chinese security chief and Politburo member, Zhou Yongkang, who was arrested and expelled from the Communist Party last year in one of the biggest graft cases in decades.The most striking details about Kaisa were public. Court documents from a 2010 corruption trial in southern China show that the chairman, Mr. Guo, confessed to paying a $130,000 bribe to a high-ranking judicial official in Guangzhou to gain favorable treatment in a Kaisa property deal. And while the company has never acknowledged the case in public filings, the details are available in the court\u2019s verdict.\u201cMany investors are shocked at what happened,\u201d says Neil McDonald, a lawyer in Hong Kong for Kirkland & Ellis, which is advising some of Kaisa\u2019s bondholders. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling that in a market as sophisticated as this, no one knew what was going on.\u201dKaisa\u2019s 2009 initial public offering prospectus is a mind-numbing 837 pages of data. It includes a corporate history and a compendium of regulations, risks, financial covenants, options plans and term loan facilities. It also contains a breakdown of Kaisa assets, a corporate chart with 90 affiliates, and mailing addresses for the directors.But a search for the most basic biographical information about the company\u2019s chairman and co-founders, usually standard fare in offering documents, will end in disappointment. The prospectus says nothing about Guo Yingcheng\u2019s education or work history before he founded Kaisa, at 35. Nor does it include the work histories of other important players, including his brother, the vice chairman.How Mr. Guo, 50, made his early fortune is a mystery, even to research analysts who have covered Kaisa for years. \u201cThere\u2019s a history of Kaisa, but not too much on how the founders made their money,\u201d says Franco Leung, an analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service.Mr. Guo is from Chaoshan, a region of southern China that is the birthplace of some of the country\u2019s most dynamic entrepreneurs. He grew up in a poor village, called Tieshanyang, dotted with ancestral temples and clay-tiled homes. Residents say that Mr. Guo is the son of a local shopkeeper and that he left home at 16 to join his uncles on Hainan Island, where he sold fish and traded in imported goods.Excited by China\u2019s property boom, wealthy investors poured money into the distressed property developer, Kaisa. Those who jumped in later have suffered.\u201cHe went to Hainan after the opening and reform,\u201d says Guo Wenxiong, a resident of the village. \u201cHe just sold some household goods, at that time, whatever you could sell. Later, his business picked up, and he brought his brothers to Hainan.\u201dAfter that, his story has major gaps. Corporate records suggest that he and his brothers worked in property construction or the import and export business.What is known is that by 1999, Mr. Guo had amassed enough money to start Kaisa, in China\u2019s fast-growing manufacturing center Shenzhen. From the outset, the company focused on redeveloping distressed properties near one of Shenzhen\u2019s biggest industrial parks.When Credit Suisse found Kaisa, the company had completed only a handful of residential developments, hardly noteworthy for their architecture or amenities. But given the property boom, the bank saw the potential, as did investors. The Carlyle Group, the Singapore investment fund Temasek Holdings and other investors bought a 12 percent stake in Kaisa in 2007 for $300 million. That deal helped attract investments from a group of Hong Kong tycoons, including the billionaires Cheng Yu-tung and Lee Shau-kee.Energized with money from major backers, Kaisa underwent a rapid transformation. The developer started building residential communities with aspirational names like Lake View Place and Monarch Residences, and built more than a dozen hotels, including the Jinsha Bay Kaisa Marriott Hotel in Shenzhen.Kaisa then went in search of more money, this time tapping global bond investors. Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse lined up to win a share of the fat fees from selling the bonds. Mutual funds and other major investors were attracted by the high interest rates, up to 13 percent. In all, Kaisa sold about $2.5 billion in bonds.\u201cThey were a turnaround story,\u201d said Wee Liat Lee, a property analyst at BNP Paribas. \u201cThey had started out with bad-quality land and then got better land and hired good people.\u201dCarlyle, which sold the last of its stake in Kaisa in 2012 at a decent profit, declined to comment. Citigroup, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase also declined to comment.As the money poured in, Kaisa\u2019s deals started to look increasingly risky, fraught with potential conflicts of interest. Company disclosure became less transparent.Corporate records filed with the Chinese authorities show that more than a dozen of the chairman\u2019s relatives have been involved in Kaisa property deals, including his father, brothers, cousins and in-laws. One affiliate was set up by the spouse of a Kaisa senior executive. Another was registered by two low-level Kaisa employees who, until recently, were cooks at the company\u2019s headquarters, according to interviews with employees.Regulators often require detailed disclosures on deals with affiliates. The risk is that such parties could siphon off money from the company or allow senior executives to make deals with favorable terms to friends and relatives, at the expense of the company.As Kaisa grew, it also became entangled in power politics.According to corporate documents, Mr. Guo and several Kaisa affiliates last year acquired a large stake in National Trust, a midsize financial services firm based in Beijing that has long had connections with the relatives of the former prime minister Wen Jiabao. In 2004, the prime minister\u2019s daughter, Wen Ruchun, held a stake in National Trust through a network of shell companies using an alias, Lily Chang. Mr. Guo and the Kaisa affiliates bought the position from companies controlled by the Hong Kong businessman Zheng Jianyuan, a longtime partner of the Wen family.A National Trust spokeswoman denies such a sale took place and says the privately held firm had no relationship to Kaisa.Kaisa may have also stepped into a political minefield by acquiring land in the city of Chengdu with a company partly controlled by the relatives of the former Politburo member Zhou Yongkang. Mr. Zhou\u2019s downfall last year set off political fallout that has rippled through the business community. A group of Communist Party officials who worked with Mr. Zhou were arrested, while business executives who were in partnerships with his family have also been detained or imprisoned.The Sinopec Tower is one of Kaisa\u2019s flagship properties. The building, in Guangzhou, one of southern China\u2019s biggest cities, consists of two 51-story office towers and a six-story shopping arcade. One of the shops is a Chaoshan-style restaurant that cooks food from Mr. Guo\u2019s hometown.But Kaisa took control of Sinopec Tower in a controversial deal, tainted by bribery and corruption.Sinopec Tower was originally developed by a Chinese businessman named Zhong Hua in the early 1990s. His vision was to build an office and shopping complex that would anchor the city\u2019s newest commercial corridor. He called it Zhongcheng Plaza.But in 1996, as the complex was nearing completion, work was halted by a court order. A state-owned company had demanded payment for debts it said were owed by one of the building\u2019s partners. The court case dragged on for years, and the project languished.In 2004, a proposed sale fell apart when the buyer was accused of fraud. That is when Kaisa stepped in. Kaisa, with court approval, acquired Zhongcheng Plaza in 2006 for about $118 million, according to state-run media. Soon after, Kaisa sold one of the plaza\u2019s two office towers to Sinopec for $160 million. Kaisa kept the other tower and shopping mall, valuing those three years later, in its I.P.O. prospectus, at more than $200 million. It was an extremely profitable investment.Two years later, however, a case against a high-ranking judicial official at the Guangdong High People\u2019s Court cast a shadow on Kaisa\u2019s deal. The judicial official, Yang Xiancai, was arrested on corruption charges.At his trial, Mr. Yang confessed to receiving many payoffs, including a $130,000 bribe from Kaisa\u2019s chairman, Mr. Guo, for help acquiring Zhongcheng Plaza. Mr. Yang is now serving a life sentence. During the trial, Mr. Guo confessed to making the bribe payment, according to the court verdict. He escaped punishment.In a recent interview, Mr. Zhong, the original developer of the site, said that the judicial officer, Mr. Yang, had pressured him to sell at a below-market price.\u201cThey were working together,\u201d Mr. Zhong said about Mr. Yang and Kaisa\u2019s chairman, Mr. Guo, who both grew up in the Chaoshan area. \u201cI got trapped by this Chaoshan group.\u201dWhile he refused to go along, the court approved the sale to Kaisa anyway. Mr. Zhong said he never received a penny.Neither Kaisa nor Mr. Guo ever publicly commented on the case or discussed it in regulatory filings.But it was no secret. In 2010, accounts of the trial, and the battle for control of what became known as the Sinopec Tower, were published in major Chinese publications.A publication affiliated with Xinhua, the official government news agency, even described the Sinopec Tower deal with Kaisa as a miscarriage of justice by a \u201cmanipulated judiciary.\u201dIt did not register outside China. Analysts called the stock a \u201cpreferred name\u201d and a \u201ctop pick.\u201d Kaisa\u2019s stock price soared, and global bond investors snapped up billions of dollars of offshore debt.None of them reached out to Mr. Zhong, the original developer, or the lead lawyer in the trial of the judicial officer.\u201cNo, one ever called about that,\u201d said Yang Wenlong, Yang Xiancai\u2019s lawyer. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear from any Kaisa investors.\u201dKaisa, the champion of redeveloping distressed property in Shenzhen, is now a distressed asset.After sales of its Shenzhen properties were blocked by the authorities last December, the bad news piled up. In January, the company missed a payment on a $50 million loan from the British bank HSBC. Analysts began speculating about whether the developer would file for bankruptcy.Adding to the worries, Kaisa announced in February that its debt was valued at $10.4 billion, twice earlier projections. Several analysts said that it appeared the company had been borrowing through off-the-books affiliates, perhaps making its balance sheet look stronger than it was.\u201cA lot of these Chinese developers are leveraged to the teeth,\u201d says Anne Stevenson-Yang, an analyst at J Capital Research.Now investors, creditors and banks are fighting over its assets. Sunac, the Chinese developer, has agreed to pay $580 million to acquire 49 percent of the company\u2019s stock from the Guo family.With billions of dollars at stake, Chinese state banks and creditors have asked the courts to freeze Kaisa\u2019s assets to ensure they can recover money they lent it. Most likely, global investors, who bought billions in offshore bonds from Kaisa, will take a huge loss. A restructuring, announced by Kaisa on Monday, outlined plans to cut the interest rates on bonds and defer payments on them, essentially cutting their value in half. Bondholders are pushing for better terms. If they do not come to a deal, offshore bondholders will not have much recourse, because they have little claim on the underlying assets. Kaisa says they may get only 2.4 cents on the dollar.Whether politics played a role in Kaisa\u2019s downfall is unclear, though there has been speculation that the company\u2019s connection to the family of the former security chief Zhou Yongkang was a factor. Bloomberg News has reported that the company may have been undone by its ties to Jiang Zunyu, a high-ranking Communist Party official in Shenzhen who was detained last October on suspicion of corruption and later found to have 42 homes and $32 million in unexplained cash.But analysts say Kaisa may also have been suffering from financial stress in the property slump. Chinese government restrictions on borrowing for land purchases had also made it more difficult to finance developments. While other Chinese property firms have run into serious trouble, few have prompted such a fallout among Western investors.Whatever the case, the situation was dire enough that the Guo brothers sold their entire stake in Kaisa.Several lawyers in the case say that Guo Yingcheng is in Hong Kong, which is under a separate legal system, and refuses to return to mainland China. In early February, a young woman at the luxurious Residence Bel-Air, a complex where he has an apartment, came to the door. She said Mr. Guo was home and then went to consult with him. She came back several minutes later with a message from the chairman: \u201cPlease go away!\u201dZhang Ruoyao and Phoebe Peng contributed research.Advertisement"}

Ms. Rousseff, a former Marxist guerrilla leader, will not become a firm American ally overnight, and there is much on which the two governments will continue to agree to disagree. Brazil, for instance, has been critical of the use of American military force abroad and has in the past used its diplomatic clout to strengthen multilateral institutions that act as a counterweight to Washington. Nonetheless, Brazil can play a pivotal role in two Latin American countries that are of growing importance to the United States.

Even within the Conservative Party, there is some skepticism about American leadership, a feeling long shared on the British left.\u201cSometimes for economic growth you have to do what you have to do,\u201d said Robin Niblett, the director of the London think tank Chatham House, citing Mr. Cameron\u2019s wariness about meeting the Dalai Lama and Britain\u2019s soft tone on the pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong, as well as its intention to cut military spending below the NATO guideline of 2 percent of G.D.P.\u201cIt reminds voters that Britain\u2019s relationship with America is essential, but does not always have to be a special relationship in lock step,\u201d Mr. Niblett said.Britain\u2019s announcement on Thursday that it intends to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which China is largely funding in hopes of becoming the dominant influence in Asian affairs, has bolstered the fledgling bank\u2019s reputation even before it begins operations, analysts said, and will encourage other American allies, like South Korea and Australia, to become members.On the military side, senior members of the Obama administration, joined by a number of senior Conservative Party legislators, are pressing Mr. Cameron to spend more on the military, arguing that Russia is on the march and that Britain risks losing further influence if it trims too far.Britain is one of the few countries in Europe to have a serious military and to spend 2 percent of G.D.P. on defense, a guideline to which Mr. Cameron committed himself at last year\u2019s NATO summit meeting in Wales.But military experts assert that Britain is already falling below that percentage, and budget plans for the next five years, should the party regain office, will bring even sharper cuts even as NATO faces new threats from a revanchist Russia.Britain\u2019s military establishment has come out strongly against further projected cuts on top of those of the last five years, and so, now, have senior American officials, like Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the Army chief of staff.But as with the Chinese bank, Washington is also concerned that if Britain breaks its pledge on 2 percent, it will encourage other European countries to spend even less than they are spending now. Washington, which already accounts for about 70 percent of NATO\u2019s military spending, wants the Europeans to shoulder more responsibility.The study\u2019s pessimistic scenario sees a cut of 10 percent in real terms for defense over the next four years; the optimistic one sees an increase in spending of about \u00a34 billion a year, but still only 1.75 percent of G.D.P. by 2019. It warned that the combined strength of the army, navy and air force could fall from 145,000 personnel to 115,000 by 2020.The group also noted that since 2010, military spending has decreased 4.3 percent in real terms, mostly represented in cuts to personnel, but similar savings are harder now and new equipment costs are high.Mr. Cameron and his Conservative Party are running an election campaign for May\u2019s vote on their stewardship of the economy and their commitment to a balanced budget and a smaller state. His campaign strategist, Lynton Crosby, is discouraging Tory candidates from talking about much else, to the point that defense is not even mentioned as a possible voter concern.On Thursday, John Baron, a Conservative legislator and former army officer, led a backbench debate on military spending, urging the government to keep to the 2 percent target and condemning both his own party and the Labour Party for refusing to commit to the target in the next Parliament.\u201cHaving lectured other NATO members as to its importance, we ourselves should lead by example,\u201d he said.On the Asian bank, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, made it clear Thursday that Britain was intent on joining, calling it \u201can unrivaled opportunity for the U.K. and Asia to invest and grow together.\u201dThe Chinese have been promoting \u201cthe new Silk Road\u201d binding China and Europe together on trade, and Britain, which is seeking to expand its exports, does not want to offend Beijing.The Chinese Finance Ministry warmly welcomed the British announcement, saying on its website on Friday that if all went well, Britain would formally become a \u201cprospective founding member\u201d of the bank by the end of March.But fundamentally, Washington views the Chinese venture as a deliberate challenge to those postwar institutions, which are led by the United States and, to a lesser extent, Japan.Washington is facing a similar challenge to the postwar order in Europe from Russia, which is why the Americans want NATO to bolster its defenses and deterrence.The National Security Council in Washington implicitly criticized Britain\u2019s decision on the bank, suggesting that it had gone against Mr. Obama\u2019s desires.\u201cThis is the U.K.\u2019s sovereign decision,\u201d a spokesman at the National Security Council said. \u201cWe hope and expect that the U.K. will use its voice to push for the adoption of high standards.\u201dIn South Korea, Britain\u2019s announcement is likely to reignite the government\u2019s internal debate about the merits of membership, said Hahm Chaibong, president of the Asian Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.\u201cIt will give a lot of ammunition to those who have been pushing for it,\u201d Dr. Hahm said. \u201cThe Ministries of Trade and Finance have been for it. The United States has been unremittingly negative.\u201dHaving South Korea as a founding member would be a considerable coup for Beijing. President Xi Jinping of China has been wooing President Park Geun-hye, who must balance the security that the United States provides to South Korea against the relatively new economic clout of China.Steven Erlanger reported from London, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Urging Persistence on Racial Gains, Obama Recalls Sacrifice in Selma", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 For the nation\u2019s first African-American president, it was a week of two documents that told the story of a country still grappling with its own history.The first was a draft speech that President Obama was marking up with his distinctive left-hand scrawl to deliver in Selma, Ala., on Saturday to celebrate a half-century of civil rights gains. The second was a report he received accusing the police in Ferguson, Mo., of systematically discriminating against African-Americans.More than once, Mr. Obama has credited the courage of protesters in Selma who were confronted by club-wielding state troopers 50 years ago for clearing the way for his own barrier-breaking election as president. But the path from Selma to the Oval Office has also led to Ferguson and back to Selma, a path littered with hope and progress and disappointment and setback.\u201cWhat happened in Ferguson is not a complete aberration,\u201d Mr. Obama told a young African-American man who asked him about it Friday at Benedict College, a historically black school. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a one-time thing. It\u2019s something that happens.\u201d And so, he added, \u201cOur task is to work together to solve the problem and not get caught up in either the cynicism that says this is never going to change because everybody is racist. That\u2019s not a good solution.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what the folks in Selma did,\u201d he added. \u201cThey had confidence that they could change things, and change people\u2019s hearts and minds.\u201dIn a scathing report released Wednesday, the Justice Department concluded that the Ferguson Police Department had been routinely violating the constitutional rights of its black residents.Eight years after Mr. Obama first spoke at Selma, the dream of a post-racial society that some foresaw in his rise to power has receded into a murkier reality.Mr. Obama presides over a country where blacks are still twice as likely to be unemployed as whites; where gaps in income and wealth between races are widening rather than closing; where blacks are five times likelier to be in prison and young black men are nine times as likely to be killed in a homicide as their white counterparts; and where blacks get sick more, die younger and own less.\u201cWhen you look at all the statistics, I don\u2019t know that the last six years have been particularly good for people of color,\u201d said Senator Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina and one of two black members of the Senate. \u201cAnd when you look at race relations, I think you could say at best they\u2019re where they were before six years ago.\u201dHe went on: \u201cI don\u2019t know that you can lay that on the shoulders of one person, but when you look at the policies\u201d enacted by Mr. Obama, they \u201chave had a miserable impact on the country.\u201dTo Mr. Obama\u2019s supporters, the fierce opposition to his presidency has been fueled by race, even if that is not openly acknowledged.\u201cFor many people it feels worse because we have seen such a reaction to this presidency that has been really alarming and without question from many quarters has been based in part on his race,\u201d said Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. \u201cHis candidacy suggested we had reached a new moment in America, and I think some people overestimated the meaning of that moment.\u201dThe Justice Department\u2019s investigation into law enforcement in Ferguson, Mo., found that the police and courts meted out illegal and unduly harsh treatment, particularly to black people.Many of Mr. Obama\u2019s supporters blame his opponents. \u201cI think the president has done all he could do,\u201d said George E. Battle Jr., senior bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. \u201cBut sometimes I think once the president was elected, we thought he could do everything. But he can\u2019t. When you have governors and you have senators and you have Congress people determined to turn back the clock, there\u2019s not that much the president can do other than getting on the stump.\u201dConsumed by the economy and health care, and with re-election ahead, Mr. Obama avoided focusing much on race in his first term. He has argued that restoring the economy and expanding health care were in fact policies that disproportionately helped African Americans. Indeed, 1.7 million more blacks have health insurance coverage now, with the drop in uninsured larger among blacks than whites.But lately, with the economy on the mend and re-election behind him, Mr. Obama has more actively engaged on issues like voting rights and disparities in the criminal justice system.And advisers said no one should underestimate the continuing power of Mr. Obama\u2019s presence in the Oval Office. \u201cBy breaking through that barrier, there are children growing up today who think it\u2019s perfectly normal to have an African-American president because that\u2019s all they have ever known,\u201d said Valerie Jarrett, his senior adviser.Still, she added that it was not enough. \u201cThis is no time for us to rest on our laurels,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that there are states that are trying to make it harder to vote 50 years after the Voting Rights Act is an indication that there\u2019s still work to do.\u201dMr. Obama seldom speaks at length about his views of the role that race plays in today\u2019s politics or the opposition to his policies. At a session with civil rights and religious leaders recently, he focused on policy proposals instead of ruminating on racial tensions, said Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League.But Mr. Morial said the president\u2019s policies were his way of addressing persistent issues in America, citing health care. \u201cThe things he\u2019s done I think clearly indicate that race and leaving a legacy on race are very important to his presidency,\u201d he said.Peter Baker reported from Columbia, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Expansion, Brooklyn Children\u2019s Museum Is Accused of Forsaking Its Community", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut a series of recent actions have led current and former employees, and some elected officials, to ask if the museum has forsaken its working- and middle-class clientele to lure the newer, and wealthier, residents of Crown Heights and of other rapidly gentrifying communities nearby. In the central Brooklyn community, race and class often intertwine, and there has been tension between these new residents, many of them white, and longtime Caribbean black and Hasidic Jewish residents. These issues have spilled into a debate about the museum\u2019s future.The general admission price has risen to $9 from $5 in 2008, an increase that employees say has deterred longtime, lower-income residents.And, as if to underscore the shift toward the wealthy, the museum is preparing to open an annex next year \u2014 its first expansion outside Crown Heights \u2014 in rent-free space in a new condominium building along the Dumbo waterfront, where a penthouse is listed at $5.7 million and the ground-floor museum outpost is being highlighted in the marketing materials.The museum\u2019s leaders say it is only keeping up with a shifting Brooklyn and the economy.From 2000 to 2010, the white population in Crown Heights increased 89 percent, while the black population declined by 15 percent, census data show.\u201cIf the world is changing around you, you want to maximize all opportunities around you,\u201d said Mindy Duitz, who was the museum\u2019s president and chief executive from January 2013 until this year.But some current and former workers argue that the museum \u2014 which in 2008 ran into serious financial trouble, from which it has not fully recovered \u2014 has allowed the allure of plentiful cash to divert it from its mission, and that the Dumbo annex, which they say threatens to segregate families based on class and neighborhood, is clear proof.\u201cHow are you going to service there when you can barely staff your own building?\u201d said Anne Smith, 43, a former public relations manager at the museum. \u201cWhy has there never been a satellite office for black communities, Hispanic communities?\u201dMs. Smith, who is black, complained that an administrator had lamented that events at the museum had too much of a \u201clocal feel,\u201d and asserted that managers wanted to market to predominantly white, upscale Brooklyn neighborhoods like Park Slope and Carroll Gardens.Opinions on this score do not fall clearly along racial lines: Dolly Williams, a trustee until recently, who is Caribbean, said there had indeed been discussions about how to draw more visitors to the museum from outside of Crown Heights \u2014 because it was vital that the museum do so.But making matters more contentious, a number of black workers contend that the museum\u2019s largely white leadership has eroded the racial diversity of its staff and undercut its ties to events and organizations that had longstanding relationships with the children\u2019s museum.All of which makes for a jarringly serious set of issues swirling around a place of such whimsy: a pint-size paradise where children can roam indoor sandboxes and a maze of waterworks, get up close with icky but awesome Madagascar hissing cockroaches in a greenhouse, and ride a replica of a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus whose wheels seem to go round and round, all through the town, though they never actually turn.The trouble began a decade ago, \u201cat the height of prosperity,\u201d when the museum embarked on an $80 million expansion, with $46 million in city funds, said Margaret Walton, the museum\u2019s director of community and government affairs. The work was finished in September 2008.\u201cWe had our ribbon-cutting the day the market crashed,\u201d said Ms. Walton, who is black. \u201cIt was the week everything came undone.\u201dThe expansion projected that attendance would grow to 400,000 visitors a year, but attendance was flat; it remains about 250,000 people a year. Public and private funding dried up. Other improvements, like a rooftop event space and a 30-space parking lot to accommodate guests, have not been completed. The museum is still seeking a site for the lot, while the rooftop should open by this summer, Ms. Wilchfort said.Despite financial troubles, museum administrators said the institution remains committed to the underserved, participating in programs so that about 30 percent of visitors enter free annually. New discounted membership packages, now targeted at \u201ccaregivers,\u201d can still be taken advantage of by grandparents, museum officials said.In 2008, the museum\u2019s $7.1 million budget supported a full-time staff of 69 employees. Last year, its budget was down to $5 million, the full-time staff down to 35.In interviews, Ms. Ngozi said she stabilized the museum\u2019s finances through cuts that included 25 layoffs. But her contract was not renewed when it expired in October 2012. Ms. Ngozi said that she was never given a specific reason but that she believed some museum trustees \u201cshortsightedly\u201d lacked confidence in her ability to attract visitors and contributors from far afield of the black churches and organizations that had supported it for decades. \u201cMy leaving the museum was not my choice,\u201d she said.In 2013, seeking more of a turnaround agent, the museum board reached back to Ms. Duitz, who had led the institution in the tumultuous 1990s, when the riots between blacks and Hasidic Jews stigmatized Crown Heights for a generation. While the museum had been the setting then for reconciliation meetings that helped heal the wounds the riots had torn open, on Ms. Duitz\u2019s return, the museum itself increasingly became a subject of conflict.Former and current workers have shared their concerns with local officials, who have met with museum leaders. Among the allegations were that the museum under Ms. Duitz, who is white, laid off veteran employees with valuable institutional memories \u2014 and close ties to groups like the Girl Scouts and the organizers of the West Indian American Day parade \u2014 who had long helped to shape programming.Several workers, some of whom where laid off, insisted on anonymity in speaking about their concerns to avoid retaliation or being seen as disgruntled by potential future employers. They said the layoffs fueled concerns that blacks were bearing the brunt of the museum\u2019s financial problems \u2014 and added to concerns that minorities and older workers were being overlooked for raises and promotions.Ms. Smith, the former public relations manager, has filed a complaint of discrimination based on age and race against the museum with the city\u2019s Human Rights Commission. The museum has denied discrimination and said she was laid off because her position was eliminated.Ms. Duitz and members of the museum\u2019s board flatly rejected any suggestions of racial or age discrimination. They noted that they had recruited new black members to the board of trustees and started a new community outreach group.But some workers interviewed said they felt they had no one to turn to after Ms. Ngozi\u2019s ouster: The museum\u2019s executive leadership team of six people includes just one black person, Ms. Walton.Instead, the workers turned to public officials.State Assemblyman Karim Camara, who has subsequently left office to take a position in Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s new Office of Faith-Based Community Development Services, sent a letter to the museum in December saying that he had been \u201ctold on numerous occasions of an overall culture that makes employees and patrons of color feel inferior and unwanted,\u201d and demanding that Ms. Duitz address the concerns. In an interview, Mr. Camara said he had met with museum leaders and they seemed to take the issues seriously.Additionally, the Brooklyn borough president, Eric L. Adams, recently took up worker complaints in a meeting with museum representatives.In an interview, Mr. Adams described the meeting as a \u201cvery real, candid conversation\u201d about the museum\u2019s future and how to maintain its character while addressing workers\u2019 anxieties.He said he shared the fears of some employees that the Crown Heights museum could suffer after the opening of the new annex. \u201cYou can\u2019t expand without decreasing the quality of programming that you\u2019re doing for the families in that neighborhood,\u201d he said.Mr. Adams said administrators knew they had \u201cto answer very clearly the concerns of some of the staff and to make sure they are not sending out the wrong message,\u201d but he added: \u201cThe proof is in the action.\u201d\u201cPeople are seeing their neighborhoods change,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing individuals who they woke up to next door for 30, 40 years are no longer there. And then you go to the museum and you see this programming and you\u2019re saying, \u2018What is happening here?\u2019\u00a0\u201dAmid the tumult, the children\u2019s museum remains a bustling scene of discovery, in more ways than one.Beverly Newsome, a former manager of visitor services who left in late August, spoke with delight about the children who would invariably find themselves lost in the museum.\u201cYou cannot guess what color that child\u2019s parents are,\u201d she said, because the museum draws so many multicultural families. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a picture caption on Saturday with an article about tensions at the Brooklyn Children\u2019s Museum over the direction of its expansion misstated the cost of an annex to the museum in the Dumbo neighborhood. As the article correctly noted, the annex is being donated; it did not cost the museum $80 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ending Ukraine\u2019s Other War", "Date": "2015-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Twenty-five years after the Cold War\u2019s end, the struggle for Ukraine\u2019s survival as an independent nation has become a test of the character of our time. Since the protests last year on the Maidan, Kiev\u2019s main square, the country has faced two crippling wars: a hot one over its eastern provinces, and another one over efforts to prevent its political and economic disintegration. The hot war in its rebellious, Russian-supported provinces is tentatively on hold, thanks to the latest Minsk cease-fire agreement. It has killed over 6,000 people and displaced a million more. Several major towns in the region look eerily like ruins of World War II. The other war \u2014 less deadly but no less existential \u2014 is not about holding territory but about building a well-functioning state and economy. The months of euphoria on the Maidan have given way to awareness that Ukraine has been a quasi-failing state since the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. Saddled with an unreconstructed Soviet-era bureaucracy and riven by corruption, Ukraine survives today largely on the good will of several oligarchs. More robbers than barons, these bosses control key provinces, fund private armies and finance divisive factions in Parliament. The good news is that a free and fair general election last fall brought in a new government with solid competence in several key economic cabinet posts. Moreover, the International Monetary Fund has just approved a $17.5 billion, four-year program that will provide an essential financial lifeline. The I.M.F. deserves credit for boldness; this is a rare case in which the agency has lent financial support during an ongoing conflict. In the near term, the first tranches of the aid package should be enough to stabilize the country\u2019s currency, the hryvnia, which has been in free fall. Yet overall it is likely to be underfunded \u2014 an estimated $40 billion in additional aid is needed, the sources of which are as yet uncertain. Moreover, the I.M.F. program requires Kiev to implement deeper structural reforms in just a few financial quarters than it has managed to achieve in two decades. No reform is more important than removing the distorting energy subsidies that have fueled corruption and dependence on Russia.The West should be prepared to do more, applying the Colin Powell doctrine of \u201coverwhelming force\u201d to support Ukraine\u2019s economy, including substantial debt relief and more bilateral aid. This will require far more robust and creative activism from Western capitals, foremost Washington and Berlin, than we have seen so far. The donors conference scheduled in April will be important. In addition to direct budget support, technical assistance and investment promotion, future reconstruction costs for the ruined provinces must be taken into account. Donors recall Ukraine\u2019s poor performance on several previous I.M.F. programs. They are also mindful of the hazard of throwing good money after bad, as occurred with the Russian bailout in 1998, when banks made out like bandits while the economy tanked.How could things be different this time? The practical but imperfect answer lies in a series of reforms aimed at reducing corruption and empowering citizens. The measures should include enhanced financial surveillance and safeguards in the banking system, transparency and public accountability, cutting red tape, downsizing the bloated bureaucracy, judicial reform, an independent ombudsman and whistle-blower laws. The direct involvement of an energized civil society in this transformation process will be crucial. After all, civil society started it on the Maidan \u2014 on Independence Square.The wild card remains Russia. President Vladimir Putin veered in a supremely reckless direction by annexing Crimea and engaging in a thinly veiled irredentist war in Donetsk and Luhansk provinces. Where will the Kremlin\u2019s post-Cold War revisionism end? Other neighbors are understandably nervous and preparing for the worst. As the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko put it to me last week in Kiev, Mr. Putin\u2019s goal is \u201cnot territory but space,\u201d meaning a colonial sphere of influence. Turning the Minsk cease-fire into a lasting peace will require rigorous diplomacy to resolve issues such as the rebel provinces\u2019 status and cultural autonomy within Ukraine, as well as the country\u2019s status within the European and Eurasian security context. A period of neutrality, respecting Russia\u2019s vaunted if misplaced geopolitical anxiety about \u201cencirclement,\u201d seems a more plausible outcome than NATO membership.Throughout the crisis, Mr. Putin has been careful to continue referring to Russia\u2019s \u201cWestern partners\u201d and to hold the door open for a degree of cooperation on Ukraine\u2019s debt, energy supplies, trade relations and reconstruction. Philanthropy is certainly not his motive, but chaos in Ukraine is in nobody\u2019s interest.To be clear: For national success, Ukraine must achieve both a durable political settlement in the east and an economic turnaround based on wholesale reinvention of the state. The work of Ukrainians themselves is essential, but without stronger Western support, the odds of progress will diminish.Since 2004, the people of Ukraine have staged two Maidan protests expressing their aspiration for a modern country free of kleptocracy and allowed to associate with Europe. Social expectations \u2014 and discontent \u2014 remain high. If there is a third Maidan, it could look more like a Ukrainian Weimar. Cynics in the Kremlin understand this, and so must the West.Advertisement"}

Harry, it\u2019s good to see you back on your feet.(APPLAUSE)I guess it\u2019s true what they say, you can\u2019t keep a good man down.(LAUGHTER)My friends, I\u2019m deeply humbled by the opportunity to speak for a third time before the most important legislative body in the world, the U.S. Congress.(APPLAUSE)I want to thank you, Democrats and Republicans, for your common support for Israel, year after year, decade after decade.(APPLAUSE)I know that no matter on which side of the aisle you sit, you stand with Israel.(APPLAUSE)The remarkable alliance between Israel and the United States has always been above politics. It must always remain above politics.(APPLAUSE)Because America and Israel, we share a common destiny, the destiny of promised lands that cherish freedom and offer hope. Israel is grateful for the support of American \u2014 of America\u2019s people and of America\u2019s presidents, from Harry Truman to Barack Obama.(APPLAUSE)Now, some of that is widely known.(APPLAUSE)Some of that is widely known, like strengthening security cooperation and intelligence sharing, opposing anti-Israel resolutions at the U.N.Some of what the president has done for Israel is less well known.I called him in 2010 when we had the Carmel forest fire, and he immediately agreed to respond to my request for urgent aid.In 2011, we had our embassy in Cairo under siege, and again, he provided vital assistance at the crucial moment.Or his support for more missile interceptors during our operation last summer when we took on Hamas terrorists.(APPLAUSE)In each of those moments, I called the president, and he was there.And some of what the president has done for Israel might never be known, because it touches on some of the most sensitive and strategic issues that arise between an American president and an Israeli prime minister.But I know it, and I will always be grateful to President Obama for that support.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Last summer, millions of Israelis were protected from thousands of Hamas rockets because this capital dome helped build our Iron Dome.(APPLAUSE)Thank you, America. Thank you for everything you\u2019ve done for Israel.My friends, I\u2019ve come here today because, as prime minister of Israel, I feel a profound obligation to speak to you about an issue that could well threaten the survival of my country and the future of my people: Iran\u2019s quest for nuclear weapons.We\u2019re an ancient people. In our nearly 4,000 years of history, many have tried repeatedly to destroy the Jewish people. Tomorrow night, on the Jewish holiday of Purim, we\u2019ll read the Book of Esther. We\u2019ll read of a powerful Persian viceroy named Haman, who plotted to destroy the Jewish people some 2,500 years ago. But a courageous Jewish woman, Queen Esther, exposed the plot and gave for the Jewish people the right to defend themselves against their enemies.The plot was foiled. Our people were saved.(APPLAUSE)Today the Jewish people face another attempt by yet another Persian potentate to destroy us. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei spews the oldest hatred, the oldest hatred of anti-Semitism with the newest technology. He tweets that Israel must be annihilated \u2014 he tweets. You know, in Iran, there isn\u2019t exactly free Internet. But he tweets in English that Israel must be destroyed.For those who believe that Iran threatens the Jewish state, but not the Jewish people, listen to Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s chief terrorist proxy. He said: If all the Jews gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of chasing them down around the world.But Iran\u2019s regime is not merely a Jewish problem, any more than the Nazi regime was merely a Jewish problem. The 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis were but a fraction of the 60 million people killed in World War II. So, too, Iran\u2019s regime poses a grave threat, not only to Israel, but also the peace of the entire world. To understand just how dangerous Iran would be with nuclear weapons, we must fully understand the nature of the regime.The people of Iran are very talented people. They\u2019re heirs to one of the world\u2019s great civilizations. But in 1979, they were hijacked by religious zealots \u2014 religious zealots who imposed on them immediately a dark and brutal dictatorship.That year, the zealots drafted a constitution, a new one for Iran. It directed the revolutionary guards not only to protect Iran\u2019s borders, but also to fulfill the ideological mission of jihad. The regime\u2019s founder, Ayatollah Khomeini, exhorted his followers to \u201cexport the revolution throughout the world.\u201dI\u2019m standing here in Washington, D.C. and the difference is so stark. America\u2019s founding document promises life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Iran\u2019s founding document pledges death, tyranny, and the pursuit of jihad. And as states are collapsing across the Middle East, Iran is charging into the void to do just that.Iran\u2019s goons in Gaza, its lackeys in Lebanon, its revolutionary guards on the Golan Heights are clutching Israel with three tentacles of terror. Backed by Iran, Assad is slaughtering Syrians. Back by Iran, Shiite militias are rampaging through Iraq. Back by Iran, Houthis are seizing control of Yemen, threatening the strategic straits at the mouth of the Red Sea. Along with the Straits of Hormuz, that would give Iran a second choke-point on the world\u2019s oil supply.Just last week, near Hormuz, Iran carried out a military exercise blowing up a mock U.S. aircraft carrier. That\u2019s just last week, while they\u2019re having nuclear talks with the United States. But unfortunately, for the last 36 years, Iran\u2019s attacks against the United States have been anything but mock. And the targets have been all too real.Iran took dozens of Americans hostage in Tehran, murdered hundreds of American soldiers, Marines, in Beirut, and was responsible for killing and maiming thousands of American service men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan.Beyond the Middle East, Iran attacks America and its allies through its global terror network. It blew up the Jewish community center and the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. It helped Al Qaeda bomb U.S. embassies in Africa. It even attempted to assassinate the Saudi ambassador, right here in Washington, D.C.In the Middle East, Iran now dominates four Arab capitals, Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut and Sana. And if Iran\u2019s aggression is left unchecked, more will surely follow.So, at a time when many hope that Iran will join the community of nations, Iran is busy gobbling up the nations.(APPLAUSE)We must all stand together to stop Iran\u2019s march of conquest, subjugation and terror.(APPLAUSE)Now, two years ago, we were told to give President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif a chance to bring change and moderation to Iran. Some change! Some moderation! Rouhani\u2019s government hangs gays, persecutes Christians, jails journalists and executes even more prisoners than before.Last year, the same Zarif who charms Western diplomats laid a wreath at the grave of Imad Mughniyeh. Imad Mughniyeh is the terrorist mastermind who spilled more American blood than any other terrorist besides Osama bin Laden. I\u2019d like to see someone ask him a question about that.Iran\u2019s regime is as radical as ever, its cries of \u201cDeath to America,\u201d that same America that it calls the \u201cGreat Satan,\u201d as loud as ever.Now, this shouldn\u2019t be surprising, because the ideology of Iran\u2019s revolutionary regime is deeply rooted in militant Islam, and that\u2019s why this regime will always be an enemy of America.Don\u2019t be fooled. The battle between Iran and ISIS doesn\u2019t turn Iran into a friend of America.Iran and ISIS are competing for the crown of militant Islam. One calls itself the Islamic Republic. The other calls itself the Islamic State. Both want to impose a militant Islamic empire first on the region and then on the entire world. They just disagree among themselves who will be the ruler of that empire.In this deadly game of thrones, there\u2019s no place for America or for Israel, no peace for Christians, Jews or Muslims who don\u2019t share the Islamist medieval creed, no rights for women, no freedom for anyone.So when it comes to Iran and ISIS, the enemy of your enemy is your enemy.(APPLAUSE)The difference is that ISIS is armed with butcher knives, captured weapons and YouTube, whereas Iran could soon be armed with intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs. We must always remember \u2014 I\u2019ll say it one more time \u2014 the greatest dangers facing our world is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons. To defeat ISIS and let Iran get nuclear weapons would be to win the battle, but lose the war. We can\u2019t let that happen.(APPLAUSE)But that, my friends, is exactly what could happen, if the deal now being negotiated is accepted by Iran. That deal will not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It would all but guarantee that Iran gets those weapons, lots of them.Let me explain why. While the final deal has not yet been signed, certain elements of any potential deal are now a matter of public record. You don\u2019t need intelligence agencies and secret information to know this. You can Google it.Absent a dramatic change, we know for sure that any deal with Iran will include two major concessions to Iran.The first major concession would leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure, providing it with a short breakout time to the bomb. Breakout time is the time it takes to amass enough weapons-grade uranium or plutonium for a nuclear bomb.According to the deal, not a single nuclear facility would be demolished. Thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium would be left spinning. Thousands more would be temporarily disconnected, but not destroyed.Because Iran\u2019s nuclear program would be left largely intact, Iran\u2019s breakout time would be very short \u2014 about a year by U.S. assessment, even shorter by Israel\u2019s.And if \u2014 if Iran\u2019s work on advanced centrifuges, faster and faster centrifuges, is not stopped, that breakout time could still be shorter, a lot shorter.True, certain restrictions would be imposed on Iran\u2019s nuclear program and Iran\u2019s adherence to those restrictions would be supervised by international inspectors. But here\u2019s the problem. You see, inspectors document violations; they don\u2019t stop them.Inspectors knew when North Korea broke to the bomb, but that didn\u2019t stop anything. North Korea turned off the cameras, kicked out the inspectors. Within a few years, it got the bomb.Now, we\u2019re warned that within five years North Korea could have an arsenal of 100 nuclear bombs.Like North Korea, Iran, too, has defied international inspectors. It\u2019s done that on at least three separate occasions \u2014 2005, 2006, 2010. Like North Korea, Iran broke the locks, shut off the cameras.Now, I know this is not gonna come a shock \u2014 as a shock to any of you, but Iran not only defies inspectors, it also plays a pretty good game of hide-and-cheat with them.What the United States and Iran want out of discussions over Iran\u2019s nuclear development.The U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said again yesterday that Iran still refuses to come clean about its military nuclear program. Iran was also caught \u2014 caught twice, not once, twice \u2014 operating secret nuclear facilities in Natanz and Qom, facilities that inspectors didn\u2019t even know existed.Right now, Iran could be hiding nuclear facilities that we don\u2019t know about, the U.S. and Israel. As the former head of inspections for the IAEA said in 2013, he said, \u201cIf there\u2019s no undeclared installation today in Iran, it will be the first time in 20 years that it doesn\u2019t have one.\u201d Iran has proven time and again that it cannot be trusted. And that\u2019s why the first major concession is a source of great concern. It leaves Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure and relies on inspectors to prevent a breakout. That concession creates a real danger that Iran could get to the bomb by violating the deal.But the second major concession creates an even greater danger that Iran could get to the bomb by keeping the deal. Because virtually all the restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program will automatically expire in about a decade.Now, a decade may seem like a long time in political life, but it\u2019s the blink of an eye in the life of a nation. It\u2019s a blink of an eye in the life of our children. We all have a responsibility to consider what will happen when Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities are virtually unrestricted and all the sanctions will have been lifted. Iran would then be free to build a huge nuclear capacity that could product many, many nuclear bombs.Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader says that openly. He says, Iran plans to have 190,000 centrifuges, not 6,000 or even the 19,000 that Iran has today, but 10 times that amount \u2014 190,000 centrifuges enriching uranium. With this massive capacity, Iran could make the fuel for an entire nuclear arsenal and this in a matter of weeks, once it makes that decision.My long-time friend, John Kerry, Secretary of State, confirmed last week that Iran could legitimately possess that massive centrifuge capacity when the deal expires.Now I want you to think about that. The foremost sponsor of global terrorism could be weeks away from having enough enriched uranium for an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons and this with full international legitimacy.And by the way, if Iran\u2019s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile program is not part of the deal, and so far, Iran refuses to even put it on the negotiating table. Well, Iran could have the means to deliver that nuclear arsenal to the far-reach corners of the Earth, including to every part of the United States.So you see, my friends, this deal has two major concessions: one, leaving Iran with a vast nuclear program and two, lifting the restrictions on that program in about a decade. That\u2019s why this deal is so bad. It doesn\u2019t block Iran\u2019s path to the bomb; it paves Iran\u2019s path to the bomb.So why would anyone make this deal? Because they hope that Iran will change for the better in the coming years, or they believe that the alternative to this deal is worse?Well, I disagree. I don\u2019t believe that Iran\u2019s radical regime will change for the better after this deal. This regime has been in power for 36 years, and its voracious appetite for aggression grows with each passing year. This deal would whet appetite \u2014 would only whet Iran\u2019s appetite for more.Would Iran be less aggressive when sanctions are removed and its economy is stronger? If Iran is gobbling up four countries right now while it\u2019s under sanctions, how many more countries will Iran devour when sanctions are lifted? Would Iran fund less terrorism when it has mountains of cash with which to fund more terrorism?Why should Iran\u2019s radical regime change for the better when it can enjoy the best of both world\u2019s: aggression abroad, prosperity at home?This is a question that everyone asks in our region. Israel\u2019s neighbors \u2014 Iran\u2019s neighbors know that Iran will become even more aggressive and sponsor even more terrorism when its economy is unshackled and it\u2019s been given a clear path to the bomb.And many of these neighbors say they\u2019ll respond by racing to get nuclear weapons of their own. So this deal won\u2019t change Iran for the better; it will only change the Middle East for the worse. A deal that\u2019s supposed to prevent nuclear proliferation would instead spark a nuclear arms race in the most dangerous part of the planet.This deal won\u2019t be a farewell to arms. It would be a farewell to arms control. And the Middle East would soon be crisscrossed by nuclear tripwires. A region where small skirmishes can trigger big wars would turn into a nuclear tinderbox.If anyone thinks \u2014 if anyone thinks this deal kicks the can down the road, think again. When we get down that road, we\u2019ll face a much more dangerous Iran, a Middle East littered with nuclear bombs and a countdown to a potential nuclear nightmare.Ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019ve come here today to tell you we don\u2019t have to bet the security of the world on the hope that Iran will change for the better. We don\u2019t have to gamble with our future and with our children\u2019s future.We can insist that restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program not be lifted for as long as Iran continues its aggression in the region and in the world.(APPLAUSE)Before lifting those restrictions, the world should demand that Iran do three things. First, stop its aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East. Second...(APPLAUSE)Second, stop supporting terrorism around the world.(APPLAUSE)And third, stop threatening to annihilate my country, Israel, the one and only Jewish state.(APPLAUSE)Thank you.If the world powers are not prepared to insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal is signed, at the very least they should insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal expires.(APPLAUSE)If Iran changes its behavior, the restrictions would be lifted. If Iran doesn\u2019t change its behavior, the restrictions should not be lifted.(APPLAUSE)If Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country.(APPLAUSE)My friends, what about the argument that there\u2019s no alternative to this deal, that Iran\u2019s nuclear know-how cannot be erased, that its nuclear program is so advanced that the best we can do is delay the inevitable, which is essentially what the proposed deal seeks to do?Well, nuclear know-how without nuclear infrastructure doesn\u2019t get you very much. A racecar driver without a car can\u2019t drive. A pilot without a plan can\u2019t fly. Without thousands of centrifuges, tons of enriched uranium or heavy water facilities, Iran can\u2019t make nuclear weapons.(APPLAUSE)Iran\u2019s nuclear program can be rolled back well-beyond the current proposal by insisting on a better deal and keeping up the pressure on a very vulnerable regime, especially given the recent collapse in the price of oil.(APPLAUSE)Now, if Iran threatens to walk away from the table \u2014 and this often happens in a Persian bazaar \u2014 call their bluff. They\u2019ll be back, because they need the deal a lot more than you do.(APPLAUSE)And by maintaining the pressure on Iran and on those who do business with Iran, you have the power to make them need it even more.My friends, for over a year, we\u2019ve been told that no deal is better than a bad deal. Well, this is a bad deal. It\u2019s a very bad deal. We\u2019re better off without it.(APPLAUSE)Now we\u2019re being told that the only alternative to this bad deal is war. That\u2019s just not true.The alternative to this bad deal is a much better deal.(APPLAUSE)A better deal that doesn\u2019t leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure and such a short breakout time. A better deal that keeps the restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program in place until Iran\u2019s aggression ends.(APPLAUSE)A better deal that won\u2019t give Iran an easy path to the bomb. A better deal that Israel and its neighbors may not like, but with which we could live, literally. And no country...(APPLAUSE)... no country has a greater stake \u2014 no country has a greater stake than Israel in a good deal that peacefully removes this threat.Ladies and gentlemen, history has placed us at a fateful crossroads. We must now choose between two paths. One path leads to a bad deal that will at best curtail Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions for a while, but it will inexorably lead to a nuclear-armed Iran whose unbridled aggression will inevitably lead to war.The second path, however difficult, could lead to a much better deal, that would prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, a nuclearized Middle East and the horrific consequences of both to all of humanity.You don\u2019t have to read Robert Frost to know. You have to live life to know that the difficult path is usually the one less traveled, but it will make all the difference for the future of my country, the security of the Middle East and the peace of the world, the peace, we all desire.(APPLAUSE)My friend, standing up to Iran is not easy. Standing up to dark and murderous regimes never is. With us today is Holocaust survivor and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel.(APPLAUSE)Elie, your life and work inspires to give meaning to the words, \u201cnever again.\u201d(APPLAUSE)And I wish I could promise you, Elie, that the lessons of history have been learned. I can only urge the leaders of the world not to repeat the mistakes of the past.(APPLAUSE)Not to sacrifice the future for the present; not to ignore aggression in the hopes of gaining an illusory peace.But I can guarantee you this, the days when the Jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies, those days are over.(APPLAUSE)We are no longer scattered among the nations, powerless to defend ourselves. We restored our sovereignty in our ancient home. And the soldiers who defend our home have boundless courage. For the first time in 100 generations, we, the Jewish people, can defend ourselves.(APPLAUSE)This is why \u2014 this is why, as a prime minister of Israel, I can promise you one more thing: Even if Israel has to stand alone, Israel will stand.(APPLAUSE)But I know that Israel does not stand alone. I know that America stands with Israel.(APPLAUSE)I know that you stand with Israel.(APPLAUSE)You stand with Israel, because you know that the story of Israel is not only the story of the Jewish people but of the human spirit that refuses again and again to succumb to history\u2019s horrors.(APPLAUSE)Facing me right up there in the gallery, overlooking all of us in this (inaudible) chamber is the image of Moses. Moses led our people from slavery to the gates of the Promised Land.And before the people of Israel entered the land of Israel, Moses gave us a message that has steeled our resolve for thousands of years. I leave you with his message today, (SPEAKING IN HEBREW), \u201cBe strong and resolute, neither fear nor dread them.\u201dMy friends, may Israel and America always stand together, strong and resolute. May we neither fear nor dread the challenges ahead. May we face the future with confidence, strength and hope.May God bless the state of Israel and may God bless the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you all.You\u2019re wonderful.Thank you, America. Thank you.Thank you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saving Big on Energy Bills, People Take It to the Bank", "Date": "2015-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySometimes, even the supposed experts can lose track of a billion dollars or two. Or, in this case, $100 billion.While few outside of Texas and North Dakota are complaining about this huge savings that consumers have enjoyed since energy prices began falling last summer, economists have been stumped recently trying to figure out exactly what consumers are doing with the windfall.They have not gone on a shopping spree at the mall or online. Results at many retail chains have been mixed, and some stores that are middle-class fixtures, like Sears and J.C. Penney, continue to struggle.One hint at what consumers might be thinking came Monday, when new government data on the economy showed a healthy gain for wages and salaries in January, even as spending by consumers inched lower for the second month in a row. As a result, the savings rate ticked upward to 5.5 percent, the highest level in just over two years.The yardsticks for retail activity have been surprisingly lackluster lately. Even when the effect of lower gas prices and therefore less spending at service stations is stripped out, core retail sales were flat last month and actually dipped 0.2 percent in December.\u201cThere is a little head-scratching going on,\u201d said Michael Hanson, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cYou can\u2019t deny that everyone on Wall Street has been looking for better data. The pickup in the savings rate is a little bit of a surprise and it is an indication that people are still cautious.\u201dStill, no one disputes the benefits of lower energy prices, especially for less affluent Americans who pay a larger share of their income to fuel their cars and heat their homes.With gas prices having dropped to $2.50 at the end of 2014 from a high of $3.78 in June, American drivers saved an estimated $76 billion last year, according to Douglas P. Handler, chief United States economist at IHS, a research firm.\u201cThe big question is, where did it go?\u201d said Mr. Handler, who estimates the typical household will have an extra $1,100 to $1,200 to spend this year if energy prices remain steady.As with many big questions in macroeconomics, there are a multitude of explanations, and a final answer will not be available for a while until more data arrives.One theory is that people are banking the savings, as the higher savings rate in December and January suggests.Another possibility is that consumers are spending more on services like dining, travel, housing and health care, instead of actual goods like appliances, clothing, cars and other items captured in the monthly retail sales figures. Data for purchases of services will not be available until March.Jeff Bryant, a scrapyard worker in Canton, Ohio, said that while the saving on gas is nice, it\u2019s no substitute for higher hourly pay or more hours on the job. He earns $19 to $20 an hour, but that has barely increased in recent years, and now his employer is trying to cut back on overtime and reduce workweeks to 32 hours from 40 hours.For now, though, he\u2019s happy for what relief he can find at the pump, even if he does not plan to hit the mall anytime soon. \u201cEvery little bit helps, and it makes me feel a bit more comfortable,\u201d Mr. Bryant said. \u201cI might buy a new pair of shoes for the summer.\u201dA more fundamental explanation for Mr. Bryant\u2019s reluctance to spend now is what\u2019s known in economics as the permanent income hypothesis, developed by Milton Friedman when he was at the University of Chicago in the 1950s. His theory suggests that consumer spending is determined by what people expect to earn over the long term. So temporary gains like savings on gas or a one-time tax cut don\u2019t alter underlying patterns of consumption.\u201cPeople tend to save windfalls and in this case there\u2019s also a lag in terms of spending because people aren\u2019t convinced gas prices will stay low,\u201d said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS.In a few cases, consumer behavior has changed.With gas prices on the downswing, Americans are buying higher-priced light trucks and S.U.V.s, rather than smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. In January, light trucks and S.U.V.s accounted for 56 percent of total auto sales, the highest proportion since 2005, said Joseph G. Carson, global chief economist for AllianceBernstein.\u201cWhen you drive down the cost of owning the car, people buy bigger vehicles with more options,\u201d said Mr. Carson, noting that light trucks on average cost $10,000 more than regular cars.Although Mr. Bryant has yet to see any evidence of it, the good news now is that wages may finally be poised to rise at a more robust pace as the labor market tightens, along with energy savings accumulating further. Employers added workers last year at the fastest rate since 1999, and the unemployment rate now stands at 5.7 percent, down from 8 percent two years ago.Economists expect the unemployment rate to fall again when the government reports data Friday on how the job market performed in February. And they will be watching closely to see if January\u2019s healthy 0.5 percentage point increase in average hourly earnings was a fluke or a sign of things to come.In particular, if economic growth is to be sustainable, it is critical that the vast middle and lower tiers of the American work force enjoy better wage growth, as these groups have seen paltry gains during the recovery.Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest private employer, said in February that it would raise its minimum hourly pay to $9, affecting about half a million workers, and lift it to $10 in early 2016. Last week, the TJX Companies, owner of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls retail chains, announced a similar move.While the hourly gains might seem small, they are significant economically since the bottom half of earners \u201ceffectively have no savings so they will spend any additional earnings,\u201d Mr. Hanson said.What\u2019s more, Mr. Hanson said, the rebound in purchasing power during the recovery has largely been limited to higher-income workers with more education and specialized skills. The wage increases by Walmart and TJX are benefiting the opposite end of the wage and skill spectrum, he said, and could be a turning point in the recovery.In Canton, Mr. Bryant, 56, hopes the raises these big retailers are giving their workers will encourage nearby blue-collar employers to do likewise. \u201cIt seems like everybody else is doing well and getting paid a bit more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still waiting.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about consumer spending behavior at a time of lower gas prices misstated the point at which light trucks and S.U.V.s came to account for 56 percent of total auto sales. The figure was for January 2015, not for last year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillarynomics: Big Policy Questions for Clinton", "Date": "2015-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewBarring an unexpected economic boom over the next year and a half, the 2016 Democratic nominee for president will probably not base her campaign around being President Obama\u2019s heir.The economic picture remains too muddled and the country too polarized. A candidate who can claim to fix Washington will be in a better position than one who tries to explain or defend the last eight years.So it\u2019s worth acknowledging something now: Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have far more similarities than differences, especially on economic matters.They both consider the stagnant incomes of recent decades to be a defining national issue. They both want to address the stagnation through a combination of government programs and middle-class tax cuts. They both see climate change as a serious threat. They both think workers have too little power and corporations too much.They both are to the political left of every single Republican in Congress. They are also to the right of many liberals \u2014 friendlier to markets and global trade, more comfortable with incremental change.In the coming months, Mrs. Clinton is likely to begin releasing her economic policy proposals. They will no doubt be devised to address the fact that, as she has said, \u201cit feels harder and harder to get ahead.\u201dAlong the way, she will need to deal with some thorny policy questions that don\u2019t have obvious answers for a Democrat. My goal here is to lay out the biggest of those questions. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s answers to them will begin to define Hillarynomics.But now the issue gets trickier for Democrats.Have the politics of inequality changed to the point that Mrs. Clinton will propose a top marginal rate above 40 percent? Or will she instead propose more subtle tax increases, such as reducing tax breaks, as Mr. Obama recently has?Although labor leaders support many of Mr. Obama\u2019s decisions, they also hope that the next Democratic nominee will go further \u2014 on enacting overtime-pay rules, on using the bully pulpit to criticize corporations and on appointing labor-friendly advisers. \u201cWe have learned through bitter experience that it really matters who makes up a president\u2019s economic team,\u201d said Damon Silvers, a top A.F.L.-C.I.O. official.Yet many students, parents and teachers have also grown frustrated by the amount of standardized testing. Some of this frustration stems from the fact that accountability isn\u2019t fun. Many school officials would rather be left alone to judge their own performance. Other aspects of the frustration, though, are more substantive.A central challenge for the post-Obama Education Department will be finding a way to make accountability more popular. The obvious answer probably involves fewer, better tests \u2014 but creating such tests isn\u2019t easy. The next president will have some big decisions to make.Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, has set a goal that at least 50 percent of Medicare payments be based on quality, not quantity, of care by 2018 \u2014 which is two years into the next administration.Right now, many outcome-based payment systems are voluntary. To get to 50 percent, notes Peter Orszag, the former Obama budget director, Washington will probably need to force more hospitals and doctors into such systems. And because accountability isn\u2019t fun, many are sure to squawk about it.If you want to judge how serious Mrs. Clinton is about the long-term budget deficit, keep an eye on the signals she sends about health costs. Nothing affects the deficit more than health spending.Mr. Obama has since moved toward Mrs. Clinton\u2019s view, more willing simply to defy Republicans when compromise isn\u2019t an option. But many Democrats continue to believe that if the party holds the White House in 2016, it will be better served by a harder-edged approach to leadership and negotiation. (And many Obama advisers roll their eyes at such criticism as vague wishful thinking.)Whatever the truth, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s view about these questions now matters more than anyone else\u2019s in the Democratic Party. The most influential critic of a president is the one who succeeds him, and she still seems to be the only Democrat with a good chance to do so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trillion Dollar Fraudsters", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy now it\u2019s a Republican Party tradition: Every year the party produces a budget that allegedly slashes deficits, but which turns out to contain a trillion-dollar \u201cmagic asterisk\u201d \u2014 a line that promises huge spending cuts and/or revenue increases, but without explaining where the money is supposed to come from.You might be tempted to shrug this off, since these budgets will not, in fact, become law. Or you might say that this is what all politicians do. But it isn\u2019t. The modern G.O.P.\u2019s raw fiscal dishonesty is something new in American politics. And that\u2019s telling us something important about what has happened to half of our political spectrum.Meanwhile, both budgets call for repeal of the Affordable Care Act, including the taxes that pay for the insurance subsidies. That\u2019s $1 trillion of revenue. Yet both claim to have no effect on tax receipts; somehow, the federal government is supposed to make up for the lost Obamacare revenue. How, exactly? We are, again, given no hint.And there\u2019s more: The budgets also claim large reductions in spending on other programs. How would these be achieved? You know the answer.It\u2019s very important to realize that this isn\u2019t normal political behavior. The George W. Bush administration was no slouch when it came to deceptive presentation of tax plans, but it was never this blatant. And the Obama administration has been remarkably scrupulous in its fiscal pronouncements.So, no, outrageous fiscal mendacity is neither historically normal nor bipartisan. It\u2019s a modern Republican thing. And the question we should ask is why.One answer you sometimes hear is that what Republicans really believe is that tax cuts for the rich would generate a huge boom and a surge in revenue, but they\u2019re afraid that the public won\u2019t find such claims credible. So magic asterisks are really stand-ins for their belief in the magic of supply-side economics, a belief that remains intact even though proponents in that doctrine have been wrong about everything for decades.But this is, of course, not a policy direction the public would support if it were clearly explained. So the budgets must be sold as courageous efforts to eliminate deficits and pay down debt \u2014 which means that they must include trillions in imaginary, unexplained savings. Does this mean that all those politicians declaiming about the evils of budget deficits and their determination to end the scourge of debt were never sincere? Yes, it does. Look, I know that it\u2019s hard to keep up the outrage after so many years of fiscal fraudulence. But please try.

{"Headline": "Brazil Bribery Inquiry Targets Top Politicians", "Date": "2015-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Brazil\u2019s highest court on Friday authorized an investigation of dozens of prominent political figures, including the leaders of both houses of Congress, intensifying a sweeping bribery scandal that is bedeviling President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s government at a time when she is grappling with a sluggish economy. The move by the Supreme Federal Tribunal singles out several important figures, including Renan Calheiros, the Senate leader; Eduardo Cunha, the leader of the Chamber of Deputies; Fernando Collor de Mello, a former president; and dozens of others. Many form part of the governing coalition led by Ms. Rousseff, who was re-elected in October.The scandal has shaken the political establishment over the past year, as a former executive at Petrobras, the national oil company, revealed a scheme in which construction companies paid huge bribes to obtain contracts for refineries, deep-sea platforms and oil tankers.Witnesses who have reached plea deals with prosecutors have testified about how funds were channeled to powerful politicians or to the governing Workers Party and other political parties. Rodrigo Janot, the prosecutor general, has asked the high court not to investigate Ms. Rousseff, who was chairwoman of Petrobras\u2019s board while the bribery scheme was thriving.The process is not expected to be swift if the inquiries produce trials at the high court. Members of Congress have special judicial standing that allows them to be tried only by the Supreme Federal Tribunal, effectively producing long delays in such trials. Some of the politicians who will be investigated have already denied any wrongdoing.\u201cI will give all the explanations in the light of day,\u201d Mr. Calheiros, the Senate leader, said Friday.Still, this latest phase in the scandal comes at a delicate time for Brazil\u2019s economy. With Petrobras in upheaval, some investors are cutting their exposure in Brazil, and Brazil\u2019s currency, the real, dipped 7 percent against the dollar over the past week.The turmoil in Congress is also raising concern that legislators may seek to block austerity measures as tensions simmer between Ms. Rousseff and members of her coalition.Advertisement"}

Reaching from government ministers to local officials, it deserves praise for the courage of the prosecutors. Yet Mr. Basham describes these efforts as having \u201crapidly metastasized into an illiberal crusade.\u201d He\u2019s quite wrong. What is happening \u2014 as I have witnessed firsthand \u2014 is a dramatic housecleaning that happens once in a generation. More importantly it reflects the frustrations of a young, Western-minded, post-Communist generation.The writer is the honorary consul general of Romania in Boston.Re \u201cWhy sanctions on Russia will backfire\u201d (Opinion, March 6): Samuel Charap and Bernard Sucher predict that the sanctions imposed on Russia for invading Ukraine will harm American and Western interests. Their reasoning is flawed and their alternative is appeasement.When Russia annexed Crimea by force and invaded Ukraine, it violated all treaties and understandings that had provided Europe a measure of stability and prosperity since World War II. Let\u2019s be clear: By violating those norms, Russia isolated itself. Its actions were condemned by the broad international community, which imposed economic sanctions on Russia, both in response to its unprovoked invasion and to deter further cross-border aggression. These sanctions \u2014 combined with dramatically lower oil prices \u2014 have sent the Russian economy into recession. The sanctions would not be in place but for President Vladimir Putin\u2019s bad decisions.The international system of trade and finance will miss the Russians, but not much. Russia is an (often unreliable) supplier of energy, and not much else. The Russian people cannot be fooled forever and will sooner or later figure out who is to blame for their falling economic prospects. As an alternative to economic sanctions, the writers propose broad negotiations on regional security. Would the United States and Europe try to appease Russia with negotiations over the heads of the Ukrainians while Russian armed forces are in Donbass supporting separatists and while Russia occupies Crimea? The question answers itself.The writer, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, is acting executive vice president of the United States Institute of Peace.Re \u201cThe education of Jihadi John\u201d (Opinion, March 4): Maajid Nawaz points out that Hizb-ut-Tahrir started looking for followers as early as 1953. Indeed, ideas of Islamic government have circulated in the Arab world since the 1930s and even earlier, with limited success. Islamic government in the 20th and 21st centuries has only seemed feasible since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\u2019s 1979 revolution in Iran.By calling for broader Islamic revolution in the Arab world, Ayatollah Khomeini roused Sunni opposition to what was perceived as Shiite Iran\u2019s power grab. Saddam Hussein checked Iran\u2019s progress temporarily after the 1980-88 war until he was later overthrown by the American invasion. In the meantime, this energized Sunni movements such as Al Qaeda, the Taliban and now the Islamic State, which are often inspired and funded by Wahhabi Salafists from Sunni Saudi Arabia.Unfortunately, now that the Sunni-Shiite battle is once again in earnest, radical Sunni organizations in North Africa and elsewhere where there are few or no Shiites have also been given renewed hope of victory. These struggles will last at least as long as a major state in the Middle East boasts of successful religious government.While the Sunni-Shiite struggle may not be obvious to Muslims recruited in the West, it is a constant in the Middle East. Inserting Western \u201ccrusaders\u201d into this mix only feeds Islamic propaganda. The best that Western governments and Israel can do is operate behind the scenes and assist the return of stability once the Sunni-Shiite struggle peters out in a stalemate (as it did in 1980-88) and the other Sunni remnants lose hope.The writer was counselor for political affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran before and during the 1979 revolution.Re \u201cKnowledge isn\u2019t power\u201d (Feb. 24): Paul Krugman argues that because there aren\u2019t enough good jobs to get, educating people won\u2019t get them jobs. I think the gradual conversion of higher education into job training, along with the stigmatizing of the educated from the Nixon and Reagan eras to the present, has had as much to do with the immense transfer of power to ever fewer (corporate) hands, as has the crushing of unions and exportation of jobs overseas. The profit motive dominating all things must be resisted through revalorizing education \u2014 not job training. Education as the opening and extending of one\u2019s world and inspiring students to seek possibilities beyond the manic pursuit of money at all costs is the answer to inequality. That knowledge has power.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "$200 Million to Help Food Stamp Recipients Find Jobs", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWashington \u2014 The Obama administration announced on Friday that it would give $200 million to 10 states for pilot projects to help food stamp recipients find jobs, part of a larger effort to reduce the rolls of a program that provides assistance to nearly 50 million Americans.The projects include skills training, work-based learning and support services like transportation and child care. In Vermont, which will receive $8.9 million, the program will also focus on hard-to-serve populations like the homeless, ex-offenders and people with addictions.Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez announced the grant recipients during a visit to Gwinnett Technical College in Georgia, a state that will receive $15 million. Other states receiving grants include California, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Virginia and Washington.Moving people off food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, has long been a topic of intense discussion and debate in Washington as the number of people getting assistance swelled during the recession. The number of people receiving benefits has fallen as the economy has improved.In their most recent budget proposal, Republicans have proposed turning the food stamp program \u2014 which cost about $74 billion last year \u2014 into block grants as a way for states to have a larger role in determining who receives the money.\u201cThis budget converts SNAP to a State Flexibility Fund so state governments have the power to administer the program in ways that best fit the needs of their communities with greater incentives to achieve better results,\u201d the Republican budget document reads.Mr. Vilsack criticized that move.\u201cThat\u2019s not the way to go,\u201d he said. \u201cHelping people find good jobs is a far better strategy for reducing food assistance spending than across-the-board cuts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "India\u2019s New Budget Aims to Boost Growth", "Date": "2015-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government unveiled its first full-year budget on Saturday, promising to boost growth with a major increase in public spending on infrastructure and to lower the corporate tax rate, steps that were cheered by Indian industry.Those market-friendly moves were balanced by new welfare programs for the poor, like the creation of a new social security plan to provide subsidized insurance and pensions, and relaxed targets for reducing the fiscal deficit.The budget was eagerly anticipated by economists and industrialists, who had been hoping it would contain major reforms that would jump-start a vibrant new investment cycle. But the changes proposed were more incremental in nature, and markets \u2014 which had specially opened on a Saturday for the occasion \u2014 swooned and then recovered, ending trading slightly higher.The budget speech, given by India\u2019s finance minister, Arun Jaitley, came against a sunny economic backdrop in India, especially in comparison with other developing economies. The government now predicts a growth rate of 7.4 percent in the current fiscal year. Meanwhile, lower oil and other commodity prices helped curb India\u2019s chronic budget deficits, a development that Raghuram G. Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, described as \u201ca $50 billion gift for the economy.\u201dMr. Jaitley began his speech on a triumphal note, proclaiming that the government had rebuilt India\u2019s reputation with investors.\u201cThe credibility of the Indian economy has been re-established,\u201d Mr. Jaitley said. \u201cThe world is predicting that it is India\u2019s chance to fly.\u201dAhead of the budget, much tension arose around the question of what was more important: to curb government spending or to spur growth by ramping up public investment, shifting the burden off a heavily indebted private sector and stressed banks.Saturday\u2019s $288 billion budget leaned toward the latter, increasing annual spending on roads, ports and railways by the equivalent of about $11.36 billion. It also scaled back goals for spending cuts, increasing the fiscal deficit target to 3.9 percent of the gross domestic product from a target of 3.6 percent, and slowing the timeline for a reduction to 3 percent by a year.The combination left most market analysts satisfied, if not especially excited.\u201cThis is not a big-bang budget, but a good budget more focused on smaller issues, and ironing out a lot of irritants to investors in the process,\u201d said Sujan Hajra, chief economist at Anand Rathi Financial Services in Mumbai. The slower timeline for spending cuts, he allowed, was \u201cnot particularly positive.\u201dIn his speech to Parliament, Mr. Jaitley raised expectations for a dramatic announcement, saying \u201cit is quite obvious that incremental change is not going to take us anywhere.\u201d\u201cWe have to think in terms of a quantum jump,\u201d he said. But toward the end of the speech, he seemed to defend himself against accusations of excess caution.\u201cPeople who urged us to undertake big-bang reforms also say that the Indian economy is a super giant, which moves slowly but surely,\u201d he said.Critics on Saturday complained that the new government had missed a chance to increase revenues and cut its spending, especially on inefficient subsidy programs, and was relying too heavily on improved growth and low inflation. Among them was Manmohan Singh, who served as India\u2019s prime minister for 10 years under the Congress Party.\u201cMr. Jaitley is a very lucky finance minister,\u201d Mr. Singh told the NDTV news channel. \u201cHe has inherited an economy which is in reasonably good shape. Inflation is under control, not because of anything we have done, but because the international prices of petroleum and other commodities have gone down.\u201dHe added, \u201cI had hoped that the finance minister used this lucky phase of his inheritance to give a real big boost to stabilize the economy, strengthen the macroeconomic framework.\u201dThere were no significant changes to India\u2019s colossal subsidy programs for food, fuel and fertilizer, which cost the government around $40 billion a year. The new government hopes to save money by transforming subsidies into direct cash transfers to people\u2019s accounts, a step that could save around $4 billion a year by eliminating corruption, according to the Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited.Jayshree Sengupta, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, said the budget\u2019s focus on welfare was unexpected.\u201cYou know, I had expected it to be a very pro-business, pro-rich budget, and I was really surprised by how much he has given to the rural employment scheme\u201d and other development programs, she said.One way the government intends to increase revenues is by cracking down on tax evasion, which is rampant. Mr. Jaitley, speaking to a television interviewer after the speech, estimated that the government receives tax payments from only around 35 million Indians, or roughly 3 percent or 4 percent of the total population.The new budget proposes a penalty of up to 10 years of \u201crigorous imprisonment\u201d for concealing assets overseas, and would require citizens to provide a government identification number when making a purchase or sale of more than $1,622. A new 2 percent tax will also be levied on the \u201csuperrich.\u201dCorporate taxes, meanwhile, will drop from 30 percent to 25 percent over the next four years, which could increase Indian firms\u2019 compliance, said Ajay Bodke, head of investment strategy at Prabhudas Lilladher, a brokerage firm in Mumbai. Previous governments, he said, have given \u201cgiven extremely aggressive revenue targets to tax officers, who in turn go about raising unreasonable demands.\u201dMr. Jaitley set a deadline of April 2016 for a taxation change long sought by investors, which would replace multiple layers of local taxes currently levied at state borders with a national Goods and Services Tax. A constitutional amendment bill for the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax has been introduced in the lower house of Parliament, but a lack of realistic deadlines or credible information had slowed progress, analysts said.Several of the changes most ardently desired by investors could not be achieved in the budget, and instead require Mr. Modi to navigate a polarized legislature.Among them is the liberalization of a highly restrictive 2013 law governing land purchases, which requires buyers to secure the consent of 80 percent of landowners on the property. Mr. Modi\u2019s government has submitted an executive ordinance that would eliminate the consent clause and the requirement of a social impact assessment if land is to be used in certain ways \u2014 for industrial corridors, and affordable housing, among others \u2014 but needs the approval of both houses of Parliament. The new government has yet to propose changes to India\u2019s stringent labor laws, which have also deterred investors.An article last Sunday about India\u2019s budget misstated, in some copies, the cost of the country\u2019s subsidy programs for food, fuel and fertilizer. It is around $40 billion, not $14 billion. The article also misstated, in some copies, the given name and the surname of the chief economist at Anand Rathi Financial Services in Mumbai, who said the budget reduced stumbling blocks for investors.

He also managed to cajole a disparate group of men and women, far more proficient at squabbling over leadership positions than at forging unity, to consult one another.The question now is whether the opposition will be able to pivot off the death to assert a role in the country\u2019s political life, or to sink further into obscurity and irrelevance.\u201cThey find themselves at a crossroads,\u201d said Aleksandr Pozhalov, a political scientist and research director at the Institute of Socio-Economic and Political Research here. \u201cThe murder of Nemtsov must make the democratic opposition of Moscow reconsider its strategy, starting with their relations with each other.\u201dOver the years, the liberals splintered into at least half a dozen political parties working under a plethora of confusing, forgettable names but lacking any distinct identity. Because they never got past the leadership battles to agree on a common platform, experts said, about their only shared position was \u201cDump Putin!\u201dVoters were unimpressed.The vast majority remains grateful to Mr. Putin for bringing stability and prosperity after the economic hardships and rampant gangsterism ushered in by the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Some major opposition figures served in the Kremlin at the time, which did not help.In the past year, Mr. Putin has solidified his position by striking a deep nationalist chord, annexing Crimea and selling Russians on the idea that they inhabit a besieged fortress.Europe and the United States imposed sanctions, hoping the ensuing economic hardship would prompt Russians to push Mr. Putin to change. Instead sanctions have created the opposite effect, exploited by Mr. Putin to convince Russians that the West seeks to bring the country to its knees.\u201cSecurity has a dual meaning in Russia,\u201d said Gleb Pavlovsky, a former presidential adviser. \u201cIt is both national security and social security, and in their eyes, these two notions are combined in one word: Putin.\u201dThe opposition, feeling boxed in at home, often endorsed sanctions and other Western efforts to pressure Mr. Putin. They also emphasized what they called the need for Western values like the rule of law, which failed to resonate. That, too, played into Mr. Putin\u2019s hands.The Kremlin used its monopoly over state television to paint the opposition as Western stooges, hammering home the idea daily that government critics constituted a \u201cfifth column,\u201d or in Mr. Putin\u2019s words, \u201cnational traitors\u201d working for foreign interests.The most prevalent theory among the opposition is that rogue far-right extremists assassinated Mr. Nemtsov \u2014 pointing to repeated statements at demonstrations by right-wing activists that they just awaited an order from Mr. Putin to \u201ccleanse\u201d the country of traitors. The latest such episodes occurred Feb. 21 in central Moscow during a demonstration by the anti-Maidan movement \u2014 a Kremlin-endorsed nationalist movement determined to thwart demands for government change in Russia like the revolution that occurred in Ukraine.Prominent members of the anti-Maidan movement held a news conference on Thursday to deny any link to the killing. It was orchestrated from abroad, they said.But government critics maintain that the continual refrain about treachery created an \u201catmosphere of hatred\u201d that they blame for Mr. Nemtsov\u2019s death.\u201cIt is the result of this propaganda of hate, because every day, the Russian media is trying to persuade Russian citizens that there are enemies of our country working for the State Department, working for Washington or some other countries, and they want to ruin Russia,\u201d said Dmitry Gudkov, a young member of Parliament and one of the few willing to criticize the Kremlin openly.Undoubtedly the liberal opposition has faced difficulty building a following, particularly beyond Moscow and St. Petersburg, partly because members are largely blacklisted from state news media. But it has also tended to focus on one or two issues that seem explosive \u2014 like corruption \u2014 but that the public basically disregards.\u201cThey tell people your government is corrupt, and they say, \u2018Yes, we know, but our pensions are being paid on time,\u2019 \u201d said Konstantin von Eggert, a political commentator. The opposition needs to make more of an effort to \u201cbuild a brand,\u201d he said.Liberals could probably overcome their stigma and attract about 15 percent of the voters nationally, analysts say, but first, they have to build a platform that emphasizes a kind of \u201cpatriotic liberalism.\u201dThere have been street demonstrations in Moscow this year, for example, over government cutbacks on health services. So the liberals could build a platform on social and economic changes \u2014 including helping entrepreneurs and moving away from state control of at least 50 percent of the economy, experts said.Mr. von Eggert said the opposition would probably do better if it acted more like a government in waiting, with positions on a wide range of issues, rather than just reacting piecemeal to Kremlin policy.The economic downturn \u2014 inflation could hit 15 percent and the country could fall into recession \u2014 might help the liberals gain some traction, too.\u201cIt could become a fight between the television and the refrigerator,\u201d Mr. Gudkov said. \u201cPeople try to get information from the television, but if the refrigerator is empty, they won\u2019t believe the propaganda.\u201dPerhaps most significantly, opposition liberals might increase their presence in Parliament because 225 seats out of 450 will be up for contention in 2016 in direct elections rather than party lists.But it is not clear that they can cooperate.\u201cLiberals are not popular enough to split votes among five or six parties,\u201d said Vladimir A. Ryzhkov, an opposition politician.For the moment, most opposition activists seemed too stunned by Mr. Nemtsov\u2019s death to focus on future organizational efforts.Politicians mourning at his funeral suggested opinion was divided about whether staying in Russia to continue the fight was worth the risks.Some are already looking for an out, even while acknowledging that the killing might have been designed to prompt such an exodus.An article on Friday about a leadership void among Russia\u2019s opposition left by the murder of Boris Y. Nemtsov, an outspoken Kremlin critic, misspelled the surname of an opposition politician who said it was not clear that his colleagues could increase their presence in Parliament in 2016 elections. He is Vladimir A. Ryzhkov, not Ryzkhov.

He has also promised to restore the nation\u2019s sovereignty and emancipate the Greeks from colonial subjugation. By depicting Greece in a struggle for its independence, he is drawing on a rich reserve of historical resentment.It\u2019s not hard to see why this message works. For the past five years, the troika, in exchange for two massive bailout loan programs, has dictated Greek domestic policies \u2014 from wage cuts and tax reforms to changes in regulations on the shelf life of pasteurized milk. Troika technocrats have regularly visited Athens to check on the Greek government\u2019s compliance; failure to conform means the withholding of scheduled payments that allow Greece to continue servicing its vast debts. Greece, in short, has been forced to do as outsiders tell it \u2014 or face an uncontrolled default and euro exit.The troika\u2019s intervention has preserved the eurozone, but Greece has endured a crushing economic contraction. Greeks have seen their economy shrink by 25 percent. Unemployment remains just above that rate. But for all the talk of \u201ceconomic occupation,\u201d Greece\u2019s dependence on more powerful European neighbors is nothing new; the country has often relied on the aid of European powers while resenting them for dictating its fate. It was Europeans\u2019 reverence for Ancient Greece \u2014 and their desire to see it resurrected \u2014 that fueled moral and financial support for the Greek revolution. Without the military intervention of Britain, France and Russia in 1827, Greece would never have secured its independence. But these \u201cprotecting powers\u201d also wielded direct influence over the fledgling nation\u2019s affairs and selected Greece\u2019s first king, a Bavarian teenager named Otto. The king brought Bavarian soldiers with him and conducted official business in German.Greece\u2019s lack of sovereignty became clear again in 1893, when it defaulted after a collapse in the price of its main export \u2014 currants. The nation\u2019s European creditors pushed for financial control over Greece in order to recover their money. The opportunity to establish such control came a few years later after Greece lost a short war with the Ottoman Empire. European powers extended Greece a loan to pay a war indemnity, and in return for the favor, established the International Financial Commission, which presided over Greek public finances until World War II, collecting revenues from state monopolies and imposing customs duties. The commission\u2019s presence was not entirely negative. Under its control, Greece benefited from a creditworthiness that allowed it to take out substantial public loans. Still, Greeks resented the humiliation.This episode was followed by the disastrous World War II pillage of the nation by the Axis occupiers. When Greeks refer to \u201ceconomic occupation,\u201d they mean to draw a connection between the Third Reich\u2019s plundering and the German-backed austerity regimen of today. In Greece, whether in a taxi, at the market or on the playground, I often hear people claim that Germany is waging war again: \u201cThis time, it\u2019s an economic war!\u201d One poll showed that a vast majority of Greeks believe Germany is working on creating a \u201cFourth Reich.\u201dOn the January night that Mr. Tsipras gave his election victory speech, there was one little-noticed irony. He chose to speak in front of a neoclassical University of Athens building constructed during Otto\u2019s reign, and the colorful frieze directly above him depicted a mustached Otto sitting on his throne. Pictures taken of Mr. Tspiras that night with his hands held up in victory show Otto hovering directly above him, as if having risen from his Bavarian grave to remind Greeks that, despite their declarations of independence, they remain reliant on their creditors.Otto\u2019s ghost should remind the new government that its claims of restored sovereignty are illusory. So long as private investors remain reluctant to fork over money to Greece without charging usurious rates, Greece will remain dependent on its European and I.M.F. creditors for more low-interest loans or debt relief. The creditors, of course, will be loath to provide assistance without strings attached. If Greece truly wants more sovereignty, it can choose to leave the euro. So far, however, this is a degree of independence most Greeks reject out of fear that an exit will beget far worse misery. Despite the hardships they have endured, Greeks maintain an almost religious faith in the common currency. Public support for keeping the euro is nearly as high in Greece as it is in Germany, polls show.Underlying that support is a tacit understanding that Greeks have often gained from Europe\u2019s involvement. Greece pushed for European Community membership in the late 1970s in order to stabilize its fragile institutions after the fall of the American-backed military dictatorship. Europe\u2019s acceptance of Greece brought benefits like agricultural subsidies and funds for infrastructure development. In the years before the debt crisis, Greece grew faster than nearly all other eurozone nations, benefiting from the relatively cheap borrowing euro membership provided.As it has for nearly two centuries, Greece will remain dependent on its richer, more powerful neighbors, while bristling at their interference in domestic affairs. It\u2019s an unhappy marriage, but it\u2019s likely to endure. After all, both sides have deemed separation the only thing worse than muddling through together. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Afghanistan\u2019s Next Chapter ", "Date": "2015-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMr. Obama\u2019s decision to keep 9,800 troops in Afghanistan at least through 2015 is a change from his previous plan to cut that force in half by the end of the year. Administration officials said it was a response to the expected resurgence of the Taliban in the spring fighting season and the need to continue training and assisting the struggling Afghan security forces. The decision means that two military bases from which the Central Intelligence Agency and military special forces conduct secret drone strikes and other operations \u2014 in Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan, and in Jalalabad, in the east \u2014 will stay open.After the first White House meeting between the two presidents on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said at a news conference that he still planned to honor his commitment to reduce the force to about 1,000 when he leaves office in 2017. With America headed into a presidential election campaign in which Republicans are already taking a tougher line on security issues in general, Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to slow the pace of the withdrawal should not be an excuse for keeping troops in Afghanistan indefinitely. Mr. Ghani, an American-educated, former World Bank official who is widely perceived as more serious and responsible than his erratic predecessor, Hamid Karzai, made a convincing argument that delaying the withdrawal would give him security support while he pursued economic, political and military goals. His thanks to American troops who served in his country and to American taxpayers, who are still footing a hefty bill, was especially well received during a speech to Congress. During a visit to The Times, he said the result of his Washington meetings was that \u201cwe have been given space and time to demonstrate that what we\u2019re saying can actually be implemented.\u201d The challenges cannot be overstated. One is an Afghan Army that will be unable to defend the country if it continues to lose personnel through desertions, discharges and an unsustainable level of combat deaths. Although authorized to employ 195,000 people, the force lost 17,000 troops and civilian employees last year. Another challenge is endemic corruption. Over the years, the United States has poured billions of dollars into Afghanistan to underwrite the government, the military and scores of other programs, with untold millions siphoned off by Afghans to buy homes in Dubai and millions more wasted. To get at these problems, Mr. Ghani has fired 62 generals and centralized billions of dollars in procurement deals under his purview, but he still confronts huge obstacles in cleaning up the bureaucracy. All through the war years, it was apparent that military action alone would never bring peace. Afghanistan needs a government that can bring jobs, education, health care and justice to its people and undercut the lure of the Taliban. Mr. Ghani has made a more serious, coherent effort than Mr. Karzai in pursuing political reconciliation with the Taliban, which even American generals agree is the only way to end the conflict. Mr. Ghani has big visions. He told Congress he aims for the country to be self-sustaining, and weaned of international assistance that now is central to the economy, within this decade. He talked of Afghanistan\u2019s being an Asian hub crossed by pipelines, rail lines and modern telecom and banking services. Those are worthy goals, but they are still based mostly on hope.

{"Headline": "On the Case at Mount Sinai, It\u2019s Dr. Data", "Date": "2015-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJeffrey Hammerbacher is a number cruncher \u2014 a Harvard math major who went from a job as a Wall Street quant to a key role at Facebook to a founder of a successful data start-up.But five years ago, he was given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, a crisis that fueled in him a fierce curiosity in medicine \u2014 about how the body and brain work and why they sometimes fail. The more he read and talked to experts, the more he became convinced that medicine needed people like him: skilled practitioners of data science who could guide scientific discovery and decision-making.A tall man with deep-set eyes and a close-cropped beard, Mr. Hammerbacher stood recently in front of a white board filled with an amalgam of computer and genetic code, speaking of \u201cLinux clusters\u201d and \u201cgnarly C code\u201d \u2014 standard terms in the language of computing \u2014 but the main subject was biomedical science. Mr. Hammerbacher also discussed \u201cneoantigens\u201d and \u201cgene variants,\u201d and the data-driven hunt to find and understand the rogue cell clusters of cancer.\u201cWe\u2019re pursuing problems that are computationally and intellectually exciting, and where there is the potential to change how doctors treat patients in two or three years,\u201d Mr. Hammerbacher said.Getting to this point has not been a predictable journey. He grew up in the Midwest. His father, Glenn, was an autoworker at a General Motors plant in Fort Wayne, Ind., and his mother, Lenore, was a nurse. He has had to overcome challenges, including mental illness. He has stepped beyond his background \u2014 the data of his life \u2014 more than most people.Jeffrey Hammerbacher was always a numbers guy. That\u2019s evident in a school paper he wrote as a 7-year-old in Fort Wayne. \u201cMy favorite hobby is doing math while I\u2019m eating,\u201d he wrote in clear block letters. \u201cI like doing this because math is my favorite subject and I like to eat.\u201dMath is still the subject he most admires. \u201cIt\u2019s snobbery on my part, but I view math as the true arena in which human intellect is demonstrated at the highest level,\u201d he said.He wasn\u2019t only a mathematician during his childhood. He began reading at age 4 and was soon one of the Fort Wayne library\u2019s best customers. He aced the test that allowed him to attend an excellent private school on a scholarship. Rachana Fischer, who is now a litigator in Silicon Valley, was a year ahead of him in high school. She recalls a recalcitrant student, but one who had read not only every math book in the school, but also the works of poets like Frank O\u2019Hara and Vladimir Mayakovsky.\u201cHis career is based on analyzing people by data and numbers,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he doesn\u2019t fit into any box himself.\u201dMr. Hammerbacher was a star pitcher in high school and, while his grades lagged, his athletic ability and his scores on standardized tests got him into Harvard. But by his sophomore year, he was struggling. He rarely attended classes, and he simply skipped final exams in his sophomore year.Looking back, Mr. Hammerbacher called his behavior \u201cvery wasteful\u201d and \u201cdumb\u201d and part of a disturbing pattern. \u201cI\u2019ve had troubles with mood and anxiety at times in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a challenge for me. It\u2019s been very humbling.\u201dHe left Harvard and returned to his family\u2019s home in Fort Wayne, where he joined his father for a while at the G.M. factory. A year later, chastened by his experience, he went back to Harvard, and graduated in 2005.From that point on, Mr. Hammerbacher says, his career has been a matter of repeatedly following the smartest people in search of the best problems. Many of the sharpest math graduates from Harvard were going to Wall Street, and he did too.He landed at Bear Stearns in the summer of 2005 \u2014 three years before it collapsed in the financial crisis. As a quantitative analyst, he built sophisticated computer models, mainly for mortgage securities. \u201cOn a single mortgage hedge,\u201d he recalled, \u201cwe made or lost more in a day than my father made in a lifetime.\u201dHe stayed at Bear Stearns less than a year, enjoying the intellectual challenge of the work, but ultimately finding it unsatisfying. \u201cOur whole goal was to make the models more complex,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a really bad use of quantitative skills.\u201dBetter problems, Mr. Hammerbacher believed, were on the horizon. He wanted to work for one of the Internet companies that were becoming natural laboratories for data science, and in 2006, he joined one of the most promising. It was a Silicon Valley start-up with fewer than 50 employees, including several people he knew from Harvard. He got a job at Facebook.The social network was then a two-year-old company with sky\u2019s-the-limit ambitions. Mr. Hammerbacher was 23, two years older than Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive.Soon after arriving, Mr. Hammerbacher decided he wanted to use Facebook\u2019s data to improve its service. With a small team, he built software tools for gathering, analyzing and experimenting with data. Mostly, these were tests of what works best. For example, which page layout or feature change prompts users to spend more time on Facebook, or makes them more likely to send messages or post pictures.One group of online users is shown the change being tested, and another group is not. This so-called A/B testing is routine now in website development, online advertising and marketing. At Facebook, it would become more sophisticated in the years after Mr. Hammerbacher left. But he played an instrumental role in starting it. \u201cHe laid the foundation for doing data analysis at scale,\u201d said Itamar Rosenn, manager of data science infrastructure at Facebook.Facebook was a great petri dish for data science, but after three years, Mr. Hammerbacher tired of social networks and online advertising. He departed in late 2008, with shares worth millions, but with far less money than he would have made if he had stayed until Facebook went public in 2012. He has no regrets, he insists. Leaving Facebook, he said, freed him to \u201cwork on things that matter more.\u201dWhile at Cloudera, Mr. Hammerbacher says, he took the punishing start-up lifestyle to self-destructive extremes.Marathon workdays were capped by nights of partying, drinking and recreational drugs. His professional and personal life suffered. At work, Mr. Hammerbacher\u2019s appearance at meetings became less predictable.In March 2010, his old mood and anxiety problems erupted into a full-blown crisis. Mr. Hammerbacher was rushed to the emergency ward of a San Francisco hospital with a raging panic attack that felt like cardiac arrest or a stroke. A psychiatrist later diagnosed bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety. He quit recreational drugs and alcohol. He was treated with prescription drugs for several months, and also found that regular sleep, eating habits and exposure to sunlight helped.Today, by all accounts, Mr. Hammerbacher is healthy and fit.\u201cHe really committed himself to being sober,\u201d said Halle Tecco, his wife, who is executive managing director and co-founder of Rock Health, which funds and advises start-ups in health care, \u201cand to his family, his friends and his work.\u201dMr. Hammerbacher responded to his personal health crisis with a characteristic outburst of curiosity, reading and seeking people to learn from. That propelled him toward medicine \u2014 and to work with Dr. Schadt at Mount Sinai.Dr. Schadt had concluded that medicine was ripe for a data-driven revolution. Chronic diseases, Dr. Schadt explained, are not caused by single genes, but are \u201ccomplex networked disorders\u201d involving genetics, but also patient characteristics such as weight, age, gender, vital signs, tobacco use, toxic exposure and exercise routines \u2014 all of which can be captured as data and modeled.\u201cWe are trying to move medicine in the direction of climatology and physics; disciplines that are far more advanced and mature quantitatively,\u201d he said.That message resonated with Mr. Hammerbacher. By 2013 he was spending most of his time in New York rather than on the West Coast, assembling a research team that now numbers 10 people. Their expertise spans the breadth of data science: machine learning, data visualization, statistics and programming.His group\u2019s objective is to alter how doctors treat patients someday. For example, Mount Sinai medical researchers have done promising work on personalized cancer treatments. It involves the genetic sequencing of a patient\u2019s healthy cells and cancer tumor. Once the misbehaving gene cluster is identified and analyzed, it is targeted with tailored therapies, drugs or vaccines that stimulate the body\u2019s defenses.Mr. Hammerbacher\u2019s team does not do the basic science. Other researchers do that. His group works on the \u201ccomputational pipeline,\u201d he said, with the goal of making personalized cancer treatments more automated and thus more affordable and practical. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately what cancer cures are going to look like,\u201d he said.The road to technology revolutions is paved with failure, halting progress and hard work. Mr. Hammerbacher and his colleagues are engaged in pathbreaking yet often frustrating data science work.He is optimistic about his initiative\u2019s prospects, but has come to appreciate that the mysteries of the human body may be more resistant to math than finance or social networks are. Today he speaks less about quants taking over than about their lending a hand. \u201cWe\u2019re not the most important people,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we can help.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stephen J. Immelt of Hogan Lovells: Raised to Believe \u2018You Can Fix This\u2019", "Date": "2015-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorner OfficeQ. Were you in leadership roles when you were younger?Tell me about your parents. Both my parents are still alive, and they grew up in families that were profoundly affected by the Depression. It was a struggle, and so stability \u2014 having a good job and being able to buy a house \u2014 was really important to them. I can still remember when we moved into our first house and what a celebratory event that was.They were not didactic people, but the lesson from them was, don\u2019t be a victim. You have the opportunity to change what you\u2019re not happy with. If my brother or I would come home with a complaint about something, they would say, \u201cYou can fix this.\u201d That was very much the way they raised us.My father also was always asking us questions to push and provoke us. Whatever you said, you had to be prepared to defend it or explain, and then be prepared to have him come back with outlandish counterstrokes. He was always challenging us in a good way. Your brother Jeff is the C.E.O. of General Electric. Not every family has two brothers who grew up to be prominent C.E.O.s. Any theories about that?I don\u2019t have an explanation for it. Maybe it\u2019s just that our parents always encouraged us to think big. There was never a sense that you can\u2019t do this or you can\u2019t do that. And they created in us a huge well of curiosity, and a drive to experience the world.They also instilled in us the importance of being authentic. I don\u2019t think that word ever left my parents\u2019 mouths, but the worst thing they would say about somebody was that they were a phony. The lesson was to just always be yourself.Did you have an idea what you wanted to do for a career when you went to college?I went to Yale, but growing up in Finneytown, Ohio, I had no idea what Yale was at the time. And there was a short window back then when you could afford to go to a school like Yale. The tuition, room and board during my freshman year was something like $3,900.I was a history major. I\u2019ve always been interested in why people do what they do. I wasn\u2019t really thinking about what I would do next. I think at one point my mother stepped in and said, \u201cYou actually need to have a plan.\u201d I graduated in 1974, and the economy was pretty grim at the time, and so I decided that I would try law school.What are some leadership lessons you\u2019ve learned over the years?I spent the first 20 years of my career mostly learning the craft of practicing law, and it was only in my late 40s that I began to move into a management role. The key opportunity came 10 years ago when I was asked to lead all of our offices outside the United States.Suddenly I was in a position where I was managing people in London, in Germany, in Paris. That was an eye-opener. I came to appreciate pretty quickly that when you\u2019re in that setting, your own views about how the world is set up go out the window. You really have to become a much better listener, and you learn that there are very different cultural lenses. You have to make sure that everybody who has something to say has a chance to say it.That helped develop my style of management, of trying to be a good listener, and trying to think through the way Americans can be misperceived or perceived, and then trying to take that out of the equation as much as I can so that we can find common ground. That\u2019s a challenge for anybody running a global organization today, and we have 6,000 employees in 25 countries.Clarity of vision is important, too, particularly in a law firm where people are trained to be skeptical. In a setting like that, you have to be clear about what you\u2019re asking people to do and where we are headed. That\u2019s true in any leadership setting, but it\u2019s particularly true in one like ours that is fairly nonhierarchical. How do you hire? What questions do you ask?What brought you here? What were the things you had to overcome? I always ask about their weaknesses, and I listen pretty carefully to that, because it\u2019s often a good gauge as to how self-aware they are. I also listen for how genuine their answer is. Anybody can come up with some throwaway weaknesses. I\u2019m interested in somebody who\u2019s actually thought about themselves and how they interact with the world.I\u2019ll also ask, \u201cTell me something you did that was really hard, and that you didn\u2019t handle as well as you wish you had.\u201d Part of being a leader involves a willingness to step up and do things that are hard. You don\u2019t always do that perfectly. It\u2019s precisely because they\u2019re hard that they require some willingness to learn and get better.I\u2019m interested in people who share my passion for learning and for changing. I\u2019m much more interested in listening to their narrative for how they dealt with failure rather than some kind of triumphalism. What career advice do you give to graduating college students?My three basic messages are: Be curious; be willing to work outside your comfort zone; and be ready. Even with all the planning in the world, you won\u2019t know which door will open. The important thing is that when a door cracks open, you\u2019re ready to go through it and experience whatever is on the other side.Advertisement"}

So Ofelia Rosas Ramos, a Mexican living illegally in Seattle, has had her license since 2008.\u201cThat is one of the big advantages of this state,\u201d said Ms. Rosas, 31, whose 4-year-old daughter, an American citizen, has severe allergies. \u201cIf I have to rush her to the hospital,\u201d Ms. Rosas said, \u201chaving a license, I don\u2019t have to worry that I will be stopped by police and reported.\u201d\u201cYou can get pulled over for the smallest thing,\u201d she said, and a police stop could spiral into deportation. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating and sad. We are not criminals. We want to live the American dream.\u201d\u201cThis case has brought the differences to the surface so vividly because it caused the states to pick sides,\u201d said Roberto Suro, a University of Southern California professor who studies immigration.But in its legal papers, Washington cited \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that the programs would bring a host of benefits, raising wages for all workers and swelling tax revenues. It is leading a coalition of 14 states and the District of Columbia that is asking the courts to allow the programs to begin.The four million immigrants who would be eligible for Mr. Obama\u2019s programs are about evenly split between the opposing coalitions. The court set a hearing for April 17.Beyond the legal papers, though, the case has highlighted how the divisive politics of immigration have created vastly varying realities for unauthorized immigrants from one state to another.The driver\u2019s license policy, in effect since the early 1990s, has had durable support among voters because licensed drivers know safety rules and have insurance, regardless of their immigration status. Since 2003, Washington has also allowed undocumented students who came to the United States as children, known as Dreamers, to attend college at state resident tuition rates.Iowa, where Gov. Terry E. Branstad is a Republican but Attorney General Tom Miller is a Democrat, is also siding with the president and asking for the programs to start. An influx of illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America to fields and meatpacking plants in Iowa, which brought political turmoil, peaked during the last decade and has subsided, said Mark Grey, a University of Northern Iowa professor who runs a job-training center for immigrants.Many of those Latino immigrants have fully assimilated children who are American citizens. And most recent newcomers to Iowa have been legal immigrants and refugees from many countries around the globe.How different laws affect unauthorized immigrants in each state.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the rancor we used to have,\u201d Professor Grey said.California now allows those immigrants to drive, practice law and attend college at in-state rates. The state also passed a law limiting police cooperation with federal enforcement of immigration laws.\u201cWe acknowledge in California what we have to acknowledge as a country,\u201d said Kamala D. Harris, the attorney general and a Democrat, who joined the legal effort by Washington. \u201cLet\u2019s get everyone on board with the fact that they\u2019re here and we\u2019re not going to deport them. Let\u2019s figure out how to transition them in and get them to the point of assimilating.\u201dCalifornia turned away from policies of the 1990s that treated unauthorized immigrants as lawbreakers who burdened the public dole.\u201cI know what crime looks like,\u201d said Ms. Harris, a career prosecutor who is running for the Senate in 2016. \u201cAn undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. Any discussion that perpetuates that myth is irresponsible and leads to bad public policy.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s measures would give work permits and deportation deferrals to undocumented parents of American citizens, and expand an existing program for Dreamers.But the biggest shift on the immigration map has come in Texas, which has the second-largest population of unauthorized immigrants. In 2001, Texas was one of the first states to grant in-state tuition rates for Dreamers. Now it is leading the charge against Mr. Obama.The central point of the lawsuit is to stop what Texas and its allies regard as a lawless overreach by the president. But in Texas it also reflects a political change.In the suit, Texas said the president was \u201crewarding unlawful behavior\u201d by allowing immigrants without papers to stay and giving them benefits like work permits. The initiatives were \u201ccertain to trigger a new wave of illegal immigration\u201d with \u201cdire consequences\u201d for the state, increasing its costs for services for migrants and additional police officers and National Guard troops at the border.This year, lawmakers in Austin have considered bills to send 500 state troopers to reinforce the border, to require local police departments to cooperate with federal immigration agents, and to repeal the 2001 tuition law.Ms. Trujillo, who came to the United States in 2008 with her parents, fleeing violence in Colombia, has felt the change. With no working papers, she is inching through community college, scraping by with a part-time job at the front desk in a television repair shop.With a work permit, though, she would get her driver\u2019s license, look for a higher-paying job and work toward a master\u2019s degree in social work, she said.\u201cI have so many things I want to do with my life,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in Texas right now, I\u2019m just more and more limited.\u201dIn Washington, Ms. Rosas said she came to the United States from Mexico in 2000 when she was 16.

(The relationship\u2019s \u201cdemise was built into the thing\u2019s inception, was the way he considered it at first,\u201d and he was \u201cfine for a bit, clinging to this stoical philosophical read, but the loss was hitting him constitutionally now.\u201d)The most vivid and lasting impression is left by Arm, short for Douglas Armstrong, the central character in \u201cCalm With Horses,\u201d the 89-page novella that anchors the collection. Arm is the friend and the significant muscle of a marijuana dealer named Dympna, who gets his product from two older uncles who live on a forbidding farm with an \u201cin-house armory.\u201dAn ex-boxer now putting his strength to less sporting ends, Arm is also the father of Jack, an emotionally volatile, nonverbal 5-year-old. (\u201cThe doctors hadn\u2019t a notion about Jack, or his prospects, and were taking the long route in admitting as much.\u201d) Arm begins to accompany Jack on his visits to a farm, where he interacts with horses as a form of therapy. A clumsier writer might have made Arm (and other characters besides) an unconvincing juxtaposition of outward violence and inner sentimentality. Mr. Barrett makes him seamless and convincing: brutish but alive.The people in \u201cYoung Skins\u201d are in the early stages of cramped and blinkered small-town lives, but Mr. Barrett strategically pans out on rare occasion to show in subtle ways the larger forces pressing on them; namely, the tanked Irish economy. In \u201cCalm With Horses,\u201d a cassette-tape slot in a car\u2019s dashboard is \u201cjammed with calcified gobs of blue tack, cigarette butt-ends and pre-euro-era Irish coins.\u201d Later, a character is disappointed to find Irish pounds during a robbery attempt. \u201cThis is no good,\u201d he says. \u201cThis money\u2019s gone. It\u2019s done.\u201dMostly, though, the troubles here are right in people\u2019s faces. Flesh is broken or property is damaged in every story: a bite draws blood, a car is tossed over onto its roof. That\u2019s to say nothing of the Tarantino-esque climax of \u201cCalm With Horses.\u201d The stories are connected by place, rather than people, though one character, a \u201ctown tough and marginal felon\u201d named Nubbin Tansey, ambles from one story into another, to kick someone\u2019s face in.Mr. Barrett does foundational things exceedingly well \u2014 structure, choices of (and switches in) perspective \u2014 without drawing attention to them. These are stories that are likely to be taught for their form.The only question after reading the book is whether Mr. Barrett\u2019s groove is quite as wide as it is deep. When he strays from the usual types and dives \u2014 most notably in \u201cDiamonds,\u201d about two people who meet at an A.A. meeting \u2014 the results are less memorable.His judgment is better than authoritative; it is imaginative and enlarging. He has a gift for capturing the moments when things go very bad, \u201cprecipitously and in multiple ways, and for little reason.\u201dYOUNG SKINSStoriesBy Colin Barrett211 pages.

{"Headline": "A Dynamic Bogot\u00e1 Attracts Foreign Buyers and Businesses", "Date": "2015-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBogota \u2014 Roberto Vale has become a passionate rolo, as residents of Bogot\u00e1 are known. Mr. Vale, a Venezuelan oil field services executive, fled his country\u2019s rising crime and socialist government two years ago to open his business and start anew in Colombia\u2019s capital, a burgeoning energy hub. \u201cColombians have welcomed me with open doors, and we love it here,\u201d said Mr. Vale, who with his wife recently bought a 600-square-meter, or 6,460-square-foot, home in Sop\u00f3, a rural suburb north of the capital, for 2.6 billion pesos, or about $1.2 million \u2014 $1,670 per square meter at today\u2019s exchange rate.Housing demand from foreigners like Mr. Vale has helped fuel a surging Bogot\u00e1 real estate market in which prices of high-end residential units have grown an average 10 percent a year since 2011 and even faster in rural settings like Sop\u00f3, said Camilo Per\u00e9z, the chief economist at Banco de Bogot\u00e1. Rents have risen at a similar pace.Camilo Alvarado Boshell, architect and chief executive of Kubik, the design and construction company that sold the house to Mr. Vale, said foreigners accounted for 20 percent of his sales at the eight projects under construction in Bogot\u00e1. The leading foreign nationality among those buyers is Venezuelan, followed by Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese and American.\u201cTen years ago, Bogot\u00e1 was absolutely nada,\u201d said Mr. Alvarado, who studied architecture at the Pratt Institute, in New York. \u201cBut it has undergone a big transformation becoming a truly international place and one of the most important cities in Latin America.\u201d Along with close-in Bogot\u00e1 residential neighborhoods like Rosales, El Chic\u00f3, Usaqu\u00e9n and Parque Virrey, Sop\u00f3 has become a preferred domicile for chief executives and other professionals with means. Its popularity shows that buyers are willing to live farther out to gain respite from Bogot\u00e1\u2019s nightmarish traffic. \u201cThe climate is great, the economy is booming, the lifestyle is very international,\u201d Mr. Vale said.The underlying driver of rising prices is Colombia\u2019s expanding economy, which, on the strength of increased oil and coal production, grew 4.7 percent last year, more than any other South American country, said Sim\u00f3n Gaviria Mu\u00f1oz, director of the National Planning Department, a cabinet-level office in Colombia\u2019s executive branch. Also pushing prices higher is the rising spending power of Colombians.\u201cColombian income per capita has doubled since 2003 amid sustained low inflation,\u201d Mr. Gaviria said. If, as some economists forecast, Colombia grows at 4 percent in 2015, ahead of the region\u2019s 1.2 percent, \u201cthen we really will be doing well,\u201d he added. Also squeezing prices upward is the scarcity of buildable land on Bogot\u00e1\u2019s sabana, the verdant high-altitude plateau of 2,590 meters, or 8,500 feet, over which the city sprawls, said Mr. Per\u00e9z, the bank economist.The 40 percent gain in the dollar\u2019s value against the Colombian peso since July has given dollar-holding buyers and renters added purchasing power, at least for the time being. But prices for high-end residences may still seem stratospheric, particularly in developments in trendy areas or close to office-retail-apartment hubs where employers like the American International Group, the insurance company known as AIG, and SAB-Miller have set up to cut their workers\u2019 commute time. For example, new single-family houses in the desirable north Bogot\u00e1 barrio Usaqu\u00e9n, near a booming office hub known as the Santa B\u00e1rbara-Teleport, sell on average for about $4,000 per square meter, or close to $1 million for a house of 185 square meters, said Juan Pablo Jim\u00e9nez, an agent at Fonnegra Gerlein, which represents many foreign clients in in Bogot\u00e1.At the Cerros de los Alpes, a multi-unit development perched on a mountainside above Usaqu\u00e9n, the purchase prices are roughly similar and even more expensive for penthouses. Spectacular views have made rental apartments there especially coveted by ambassadors, retired generals and entertainers, with rents averaging $5,500 per month for a 240-square-meter apartment, Mr. Jimenez said. A decade or so ago, the current market conditions were unthinkable for Bogot\u00e1. Like the rest of Colombia, the capital, with a population of 8.7 million, was in the grips of a crime wave and a rebel insurgency. International businesses shunned the nation\u2019s violent image, and tourists, by and large, stayed away \u2014 except for \u201cthrill-seekers and backpackers,\u201d William R. Brownfield said in 2010 when he was the United States ambassador. But with security improving and the economic tide rising, increasing numbers of foreigners are taking to the city\u2019s Spanish colonial charm, temperate climate and wide-open business environment. (Nearly two million foreign residents visited Colombia last year, up 14 percent from the previous year and four times the 2002 total, according to ProColombia, a government export-promotion agency. The destination of many was Cartagena, a coastal resort city undergoing a housing boom of its own.) Another positive factor for the Bogot\u00e1 housing market is the possibility that a peace deal now being negotiated in Havana by the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the leftist rebel group known as the FARC, could soon produce a \u201cpeace dividend,\u201d or overall lift to the economy. \u201cPeace will make Colombia safer and drive up tourism investment and open up more areas of the country to development,\u201d said Mr. Gaviria, the planning director. \u201cNo doubt it will have a beneficial effect on the real estate market.\u201d Colombia\u2019s dynamism has not gone unnoticed among international hospitality chains like Marriott, Hyatt, Sheraton and Four Seasons, all of which have opened hotels or announced new projects. Recent retail and food service arrivals include Starbucks, Krispy Kreme, Tommy Hilfiger and PriceSmart, a discount retailer based in San Diego. Twitter and Uber recently decided on Bogot\u00e1 for their regional headquarters, Mr. Gaviria said.In less than two years, AIG has doubled its payroll in Bogot\u00e1 to 700 to staff an administrative services operation that supports the insurer\u2019s operations around Latin America. What makes Bogot\u00e1 attractive are high foreign investment, increased political stability and Colombian education levels, said Jorge Gilling, AIG\u2019s local general manager. \u201cWe looked at different cities including Mexico City and Central America where we could set up shop and Bogot\u00e1 turned out to be the best,\u201d Mr. Gilling said. He recently rented a 110-square-meter apartment in the neighborhood of El Chic\u00f3 for $4,000 a month. Purchase prices there and in the adjoining Rosales district average $3,300 per square meter but increase sharply with view and size. Prices are similarly high in Parque Virrey, an area popular with young couples and affluent single people for its bicycle and jogging paths and nearby high-end retail shops. Three of Kubik\u2019s eight Bogot\u00e1 projects are clustered there, with prices at the 50-unit Kubik Virrey project listing at about $3,400 per square meter, said Mr. Alvarado, the Kubik chief executive. The Bogot\u00e1 market has slowed in recent months with lower global oil prices, said Camilo Fonnegra, executive director of the Fonnegra agency. In the near to medium term, high-end prices could level off as builders take advantage of new zoning rules allowing higher density developments. But Fonnegra and other agencies see little risk of a real estate bubble given the strength of the economy, the low level of mortgage debt figured as a percentage of economic output and tougher lending standards since the 1990s housing crisis. Bogot\u00e1\u2019s huge disadvantage is its worsening traffic jams caused by inadequate mass transit. In December 2000, the city inaugurated the TransMilenio, an innovative dedicated bus-lane system, but the network has fallen far behind population growth and half the capital remains uncovered, said Natalia Salazar, an economist at Fedesarrollo, a think tank in Bogot\u00e1. The gridlock is why Margarita Murcia, general director of Disney Consumer Products in Colombia, joined Mr. Vale as a homeowner at the Kubik Verde development in Sop\u00f3. \u201cMy house offers me refuge from the stress of working in Bogot\u00e1\u2019s high density and pollution,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous out here.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Good Intentions, Vacancies in Refugee Camp in Jordan for Syrians", "Date": "2015-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAL AZRAQ REFUGEE CAMP, Jordan \u2014 Here in Jordan\u2019s vast northeastern desert, row after row of white steel shelters built specially for Syrian refugees sit empty.Storefronts lining a street designed to mimic an urban souk are shuttered, the silence broken only by the punishing wind that is infamous here. Layers of sand coat the windows and floors.Syrian families live in other parts of the camp, one of the only places left in Jordan where most new refugees are allowed to settle. But nearly 11 months after the camp opened, there are many areas that are deserted.It was not supposed to be this way.Built with tens of millions of dollars of international donor money, Azraq was meant to solve myriad problems for both Jordan and the Syrians who have flooded over the border since civil war began to tear apart their country in 2011.For Jordan, the camp was expected to relieve the burden that hundreds of thousands of displaced Syrians are placing on the country\u2019s fragile economy and crowded cities. For the refugees, Azraq was expected to be something of a step up despite its remoteness, a better-planned camp designed around \u201cvillages\u201d where people from the same Syrian towns and cities could cluster near shared schools and playgrounds.Despite the good intentions, only about 14,500 refugees have settled here, although at least 60,000 had been expected to live at the camp by the end of last year.The shortfall in the number is symbolic of a wider breakdown in the international system to save Syrians from a war that is entering its fifth year, with more neighboring countries making it harder for Syrians to flee across their borders and Western countries cutting back on aid and still mainly unwilling to resettle large numbers of the refugees.A look at the conflict that has dismembered Syria and inflamed the region with one of the world\u2019s worst religious and sectarian wars.The main reason that Azraq is so empty, at least so far, appears to be fear. The camp opened last April, after Islamic State militants seized significant territory in Syria and became a dangerous new factor in the war, raising anxiety that its fighters would cross into Jordan along with refugees. After years when hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of Syrians were allowed into Jordan each week, the kingdom has slowed that flood to a relative trickle.Another reason for the slowdown, the United Nations refugee agency says, is Jordan\u2019s worry that donor fatigue will leave it to care for a refugee population that is beginning to feel permanent, or at least long-term.But Azraq\u2019s desolation has also complicated efforts to fill the camp. Of the more than 35,000 refugees brought to the camp, around 19,000 have left, starving the camp of the thriving street life that was supposed to entice people to stay, according to data provided by the government and aid agencies.\u201cWhen I first arrived and saw the camp, I almost had a heart attack,\u201d said Ahmad Abed Rabo, 79, who arrived with his family last July. \u201cThe sense of emptiness and uncertainty overwhelmed me.\u201dMore troubling for Jordan, aid agencies say the vast majority of those who left the camp settled illegally in the very cities and towns the camp was built to relieve. (At least 625,000 Syrians have settled in Jordan since the war started, and only about 100,000 are in camps, according to the United Nations refugee agency.)At least in public, donors who poured money into the camp are not pushing Jordan \u2014 an active ally in the military fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL \u2014 to change its policies. Money spent on Azraq, they say, is part of a broader policy of supporting Jordan as it struggles to maintain its security in a turbulent region.\u201cThere are hard choices to be made by the Jordanian government, and we understand,\u201d Mr. Terzi said in an interview. \u201cNational security is paramount.\u201dWhen Azraq opened, it was one of four camps housing displaced Syrians. The largest camp, Zaatari, opened in 2012 and was initially known for its crime and chaos. Azraq was, in some ways, envisioned as the anti-Zaatari, a better-designed camp meant to build a cohesive community.To avoid Zaatari\u2019s cramped quarters, Azraq is four times the size and was designed with precision, rather than piecemeal as Zaatari was at a time when Jordan was scrambling to house the early flood of refugees.Azraq\u2019s designers have succeeded in some ways. Security has never been a big issue here, as it was at Zaatari, in part because of more policing.Azraq also has a well-equipped hospital and a well-stocked supermarket, where refugees can spend food coupons provided by the World Food Program to buy hunks of cheese, olive oil, rice and nuts, reminders of home. And rather than the tents used at Zaatari, small shelters designed to better withstand heat and wind house Azraq\u2019s residents.Still, life in the camp is routinely harsh. There is electricity provided by generators only in very limited areas. Refugees, many of them former city dwellers, worry about the scorpions, and about snakes they fear will be attracted by the mice that have already overrun the camp.But perhaps the biggest complaint is the lack of bustle that would naturally accompany a larger population.\u201cAzraq still needs to get that sense of community,\u201d said Andrew Harper, the top official with the United Nations refugee agency in Jordan.A satellite image analysis reveals vast devastation in major cities across Syria from the civil war that started nearly four years ago.In addition to the more than 80,000 Syrians at Zaatari, a bustling street market created and run by the refugees has contributed to what aid officials and refugees call a sense of \u201cdignity.\u201dThe street market at Azraq would go a long way toward relieving the bleakness, but it remains unopened, according to the United Nations and the spokesman for the Jordanian government, Mohammad Momani, because the government wants to impose taxes and possibly other fees on those who set up businesses. (Mr. Momani said he expected the market to open soon.)A man who would identify himself only as Abu Eiad, 51, is one of those who left the camp, in his case for a northern Jordanian town. He arrived last June from Damascus after a grueling journey with two of his remaining three children. A son who joined the Free Syrian Army, an armed group fighting the Syrian government, had already been killed, and his wife died during fierce clashes on a visit to her family\u2019s hometown, Dara\u2019a.But after living in the camp for one month, he could not take the rough conditions. He said he left legally through a temporary travel permit, but never returned.\u201cMy health was deteriorating,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take my kids out of the shelter at night because I was afraid they would be bitten by hyenas or vicious animals in the desert.\u201dAid workers said the tide might be turning somewhat at Azraq, with a small number of refugees recently leaving cities and towns for the camp, but only because they are desperate. Living outside the camp, they receive considerably less international help than they do inside, where they are entitled to free health care and larger food rations.Abu Eiad said he would not be moving to the camp.\u201cIt\u2019s true that I am living in poverty here and my son is not attending school,\u201d he said, referring to the town where he has been living, \u201cbut if I was forced to leave this place, I would return to Syria, not to the camp.\u201dAn article on Monday about the Azraq refugee camp in Jordan, which currently houses only 14,500 of the 60,000 Syrian refugees expected by the end of last year, misidentified the United Nations agency that warned in December, after a drop in donor funding, that it would have to cut off food aid for Syrian refugees living outside refugee camps. It is the World Food Program, not the World Health Organization.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ben Bernanke Has an Impressive Passive-Aggressive Streak, and Other Things We Learned in the New Fed Transcripts", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotes From 2009But it is also an annual reminder of the less predictable side of the nation\u2019s central bank, as we get a sense of their personalities, internal disputes and sense of humor.Here are some of the particularly interesting, revelatory or amusing tidbits we found in the 2009 transcripts of Federal Open Market Committee hearings, released Wednesday.Ben Bernanke and Pareto EfficiencyIn January 2009, the American economy was in free-fall, the global financial system was still precariously near the brink of collapse, and what is now known as the Great Recession was in full boil. But at a Fed debate on the central bank\u2019s extensive, unconventional programs to try to funnel money to credit markets, there was extensive hand-wringing over the possible ill effects of the Fed\u2019s efforts to fight the crisis.It featured this passive-aggressive exchange between Mr. Bernanke and the Richmond Fed president, Jeffrey Lacker, which showed just how differently the two viewed the world at that time. He used the economic concept of \u201cPareto efficiency,\u201d a point at which it isn\u2019t possible to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off.\u201cI am going to regret this, but I am going to ask you a question,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said to Mr. Lacker. \u201cDo you think the United States economy is at a Pareto efficient point at this moment?\u201d\u201cProbably,\u201d the Richmond Fed president replied.\u201cWith the best position we can be at right now?\u201d Mr. Bernanke continued.\u201cRoughly speaking. All constraints taken on board.\u201dBernanke continued, \u201cThe question was, Is the United States economy at a Pareto efficient point at this moment? And the answer was \u2018yes.\u2019 Okay. So that is obviously a different view.\u201dThe Rich Old Man and the Housing MarketAs the Fed weighed strategies for arresting the economic tailspin in March 2009, including the collapsing housing market, Elizabeth Duke, a member of the board of governors, offered a colorful way of thinking of their task.\u201cI\u2019d like to start with the story of an elderly wealthy gentleman who had taken a young bride and begun to spend money like crazy,\u201d Ms. Duke said. \u201cHis friends got very concerned that he was going to go through his entire fortune, and they elected one of their number to go and talk to him about it. He said: \u2018Sam, we\u2019re really concerned. We want to make sure that you know that you can\u2019t buy love.\u2019 Sam said: \u2018I know you can\u2019t buy love, but if you spend enough money, you can buy something that looks so close you can hardly tell the difference.\u2019 \u201dWhat does this have to do with housing? She continued:\u201cSo I think if we spent enough money, got enough of a hit right now, it would look like a floor on house prices, and we might have something every bit as good as a floor on house prices. It seems like the best time, when we have the synergies with the housing program, which should reduce foreclosures and should increase the ability to refinance. Both borrowers and purchasers are so incredibly hair-trigger sensitive to what goes on with mortgage interest rates. Mortgage interest rates went down when we made the announcement before, but that was in November, and that was not the season when people buy houses. If we do this in the spring, when there are other programs that would support it and when it\u2019s pretty obvious that there\u2019s not going to be any fiscal stimulus coming along that would also further support house purchases, then maybe we\u2019ve got a window of opportunity where we can go in there and put a floor under house prices, and that will start to move some of these other things.\u201dIn the early months of that year, the Fed pressed ahead with the bold measures it had initiated in 2008 to arrest the financial crisis. By summer it had largely succeeded.And so what would become a multi-trillion dollar effort to pump money into mortgage markets got a key boost.Not Much Good News From DallasThe Dallas Fed president Richard Fisher routinely calls dozens of corporate chieftains in advance of a Fed policy meeting to gather insight into what is happening in the economy. It seems to have been a rather gloomy experience in advance of the Fed\u2019s March 2009 meeting:\u201cMr. Chairman, I want to report on the microeconomic input I received from my corporate contacts, which numbered some 29 C.E.O.s around the country whom I talked to before this meeting.\u201dIt confirmed the view that the economy was in very bad shape. Mr. Fisher continued: \u201cIn fact, one actually called me and said, \u2018Do you want some good news?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Please.\u2019 \u201d\u201cHe said, \u2018Call somebody else.\u2019 \u201dBen Bernanke\u2019s Past LifeAs is the custom, at the first regular meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee each year, a vote must be taken on who will be the chair and vice chair. (The outcome is preordained, with the Fed chairman taking the lead spot and the New York Fed chief becoming No. 2.)In January 2009, when Donald Kohn formally nominated Mr. Bernanke for the job \u2014 at a time of profound crisis and steep economic decline \u2014 he added a coda:\u201cMr. Chairman, it is a pleasure and an honor to recommend Ben Bernanke to be chairman of this committee. I am not sure what sins you committed in an earlier life, but I sure hope you had fun.\u201dPlosser Goes RoguePresidents of the dozen Federal Reserve banks have research staffs of their own to develop forecasts for the economy. But they don\u2019t have to listen to them. That\u2019s what the Philadelphia Fed president, Charles Plosser, did at the January 2009 policy meeting when he took a decidedly more optimistic tone than his own team recommended.In the early months of that year, the Fed pressed ahead with the bold measures it had initiated in 2008 to arrest the financial crisis.\u201cI think there is still a possibility that at some point \u2014 maybe not in the first half of this year and maybe not even in the second, but there is still the hope \u2014 things could turn fairly quickly. I am not basing a lot on that, but I do feel somewhat more optimistic than a lot of people \u2014 including my staff, by the way. They forced me to say that they take no responsibility for this, and so I am letting them completely off the hook.\u201d\u201cThey disowned you,\u201d the Kansas City Fed president, Tom Hoenig, said.\u201cThey have disowned me,\u201d Mr. Plosser said. \u201cThey have had it.\u201dHe was both right and wrong, as it happens. The economy did begin expanding in the summer of 2009, but it remained a weak, subpar expansion.Yellen Doesn\u2019t Drink Like Yeltsin\u201cI agree with Presidents Evans and Yeltsin \u2014 Yellen,\u201d the Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren said at the September 2009 meeting.\u201cI\u2019ve gone drinking with Janet \u2014 she\u2019s no Yeltsin,\u201d the Dallas Fed president Richard Fisher said.Mr. Bernanke tried, apparently unsuccessfully, to tamp down the silly talk. \u201cO.K. The last two minutes will be struck.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Gains From Ukraine", "Date": "2015-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 No doubt the war in Ukraine, which has claimed more than 6,000 lives and internally displaced more than one million people, is a large-scale human tragedy. Yet President Vladimir Putin of Russia\u2019s adventurism and President Obama\u2019s restrained response are not, as some commentators have suggested, evidence that the world\u2019s security architecture is collapsing. Should the crisis in Ukraine remain in Ukraine, this entire episode would actually signal victory for the international order that the United States has underwritten since World War II. Much of Europe is more united on security issues today than it has been in years. Germany is finding its feet as the Continent\u2019s foreign policy leader. Although many European countries\u2019 defense budgets fall short of their commitments to NATO, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Norway, the Netherlands and Romania have announced that they will increase their defense spending. More needs to be done, but that Europe is taking its defense more seriously is undeniably a good thing for the United States. In another notable victory for American leadership, just years after rallying support for an international sanctions regime against Iran over its nuclear program, Washington has repeated that diplomatic feat against Russia. It was partly at its behest that the European Union enacted firm sanctions against Moscow. And those, combined with plummeting world oil prices, have left the Russian economy in tatters. In January, the ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s cut Russia\u2019s sovereign credit rating to junk status. Wealthy Russians are leaving the country in droves. Capital flight more than doubled in 2014, to about $151 billion that year alone. Consumer prices are skyrocketing. The International Monetary Fund estimates that Russia\u2019s economy will shrink by 3 percent in 2015. Mr. Putin, in other words, has bitten off much more than his country can chew. Russia may still be a nuclear-armed regional power with military forces mightier than all its neighbors except China, but it is a shadow of the Soviet Union in terms of power projection. Seizing Crimea and waging war in Ukraine\u2019s eastern provinces has taxed Russia\u2019s armed forces and its treasury, leaving this United States rival weakened, if not chastened.The Russian government protests that it has no troops operating in Ukraine. This claim is ridiculous, but also significant: It is a bow to international law. If Mr. Putin really was flipping over the geopolitical chessboard, he would not be so dogged about making transparent attempts at obfuscation.All of this has repercussions well beyond Europe. Some commentators fear that Washington\u2019s failure to react more robustly to Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine might encourage China to seize territory from its neighbors in Asia. In fact, the crisis in Ukraine has demonstrated that America\u2019s commitments to its allies remain sacrosanct, and that sends an important deterrent signal to China. The Chinese Communist Party should be wondering if it would trigger severe reprisals in East Asia should it ever secure disputed reefs or islands in the South or East China Seas. China makes much of its wealth by exporting manufactured goods, and is at least as vulnerable as Russia to international sanctions and other more assertive countermeasures, such as a naval blockade. For China\u2019s neighbors, too, the crisis in Ukraine should both justify and strengthen the current American-led international order. Ukraine had made itself vulnerable by tolerating corruption and failing to modernize its military forces; Asian states beware. Especially for those not formally allied with the United States, the risks of remaining outside regional security arrangements have become plain. It is no coincidence that Vietnam and Malaysia have been trying to forge stronger relations with the United States.Ukraine\u2019s fate as a united entity is uncertain, and the ongoing suffering of its people should not be minimized. But as grave as these issues are, they do not threaten the vital strategic interests of the United States. If anything, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine means net benefits for Washington: NATO allies are recognizing the importance of strengthening their defense capabilities; the states of Europe have drawn closer together; and countries elsewhere are seeing the need to offset regional powers by strengthening their own military forces and forging alliances. This is a point well worth underlining to the hawks in Washington. Indeed, people in both main parties are insisting that the United States arm Ukraine, even though that course of action risks escalating the conflict into a larger and deadlier war, while undermining the unexpected gains it has brought to date. Mr. Putin\u2019s gambit in Ukraine was a bid to boost Russia\u2019s strength and world standing, but it is only bolstering the American-sponsored world order. Don\u2019t interrupt the enemy while he makes the wrong move. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No One Sees Easy Way Out on Ukraine", "Date": "2015-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropeBRUSSELS \u2014 Hardly anyone expects Ukraine to get better before it gets worse, or for the latest set of commitments in last month\u2019s cease-fire agreement to be kept.Instead, senior Western diplomats and analysts are predicting a further escalation of tensions, including the placing of Russian nuclear weapons in newly annexed Crimea; more unrest in cities like Mariupol and even Odessa; more advances by Russian-supported rebels against an under-gunned and dispirited Ukrainian Army; and attempts to destabilize the Western-leaning government in Kiev, beginning with President Petro O. Poroshenko.Mr. Poroshenko, weakened by the loss of Crimea and a large, contiguous chunk of eastern Ukraine, faces Western demands for economic overhauls, increased energy prices and a crackdown on corruption to justify billions in loans and aid. He also confronts new challenges from oligarchs like Igor V. Kolomoisky over control of energy companies and private militias with flexible loyalties to the state, or what\u2019s left of it.The West, which claims to be united, is actually divided over Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine and how to respond.Having hailed the revolution in Kiev as a defeat for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the United States and Europe are indeed united in one matter: refusing to defend Ukraine militarily.But they disagree on much else: whether to provide Kiev with arms; whether to give Kiev massive economic aid and for what benchmarks; whether the cease-fire agreement reached in Minsk, Belarus, last month is being implemented.The disputes were clear this week at the German Marshall Fund\u2019s Brussels Forum.Europeans, led by Germany and France, oppose supplying even defensive arms to Kiev, believing it would prompt Russian escalation.The latest updates to the current visual survey of the continuing dispute, with maps and satellite imagery showing rebel and military movement.Washington is not convinced. Nor is the NATO supreme commander, Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, who said that the West must respond to Russia\u2019s continuing supply of troops and arms to the rebels. The West \u201cshould consider all our tools in reply,\u201d he said. \u201cCould it be destabilizing? The answer is yes. Also inaction could be destabilizing. Is inaction an appropriate action?\u201dGeneral Breedlove\u2019s outspokenness and readiness to publicize evidence of Russian intervention have not endeared him to European officials or some in Washington who do not want to be pushed into difficult decisions.Europeans say that key elements of the Minsk agreement, like the withdrawal of heavy weapons, are proceeding; American officials disagree. \u201cWe continue to see disturbing evidence of air defense, command and control, resupply equipments coming across a completely porous border, so there are concerns whether Minsk is being followed or not,\u201d General Breedlove said.Victoria Nuland, assistant secretary of state for European affairs, said the pro-Russian separatists possessed more sophisticated weapons than the Ukrainian Army. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen, month on month, more lethal weaponry of a higher caliber\u201d brought into Ukraine, she said.\u201cThe No. 1 thing,\u201d she added, \u201cis for Russia to stop sending arms over the border so we can have real politics.\u201dThe European Union has rolled over financial sanctions against Moscow, but its foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, wants to lift sanctions, though subject to \u201cthe situation on the ground.\u201dRussia faces large loan payments by year\u2019s end that amount to a third of its foreign-currency reserves, making some officials wonder whether Moscow will escalate or try to accommodate, hoping to get European Union sanctions lifted.Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former American national security adviser, is not sanguine. Predicting Russian nuclear weapons in Crimea, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that at this stage we have succeeded in convincing the Russians that we are prepared to deter the kind of steps they are adopting.\u201dHe wants to balance deterrence and accommodation, but he suggests instead that \u201cthe Russians may pursue an assertive policy towards Ukraine just far enough to avoid a military confrontation but produce the result of the total collapse of the Ukrainian economy, the wasting of billions of dollars.\u201d Despite sanctions, Russia \u201cremains a major power and therefore achieves a major change in the geopolitical situation in Europe.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the loan payments Russia owes by year\u2019s end. They amount to a third of its foreign-currency reserves; they do not exceed the reserves.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Unknown Notebooks of Jean-Michel Basquiat", "Date": "2015-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGraffitist, painter, actor, poet: The late artist\u2019s rarely seen personal writings and sketches are expressions of 1980s downtown New York, and, perhaps, of his truest vision.JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT was, famously, a graffitist who became a painter. He wasn\u2019t the only one to make the transition in that electric moment of the early 1980s, but his path was distinctly different from that of his contemporaries \u2014 and not only because he achieved worldwide renown and art-historical status with blinding speed. The other graffiti artists who made it into the galleries \u2014 Crash, Daze, Lady Pink, Futura 2000, et al. \u2014 were painters to begin with, muralists who covered the sides of trains with all-over designs in brilliant colors, often but not always incorporating their tags as major elements. Basquiat, however, was a writer. As SAMO, he dealt in words, artfully executed with marker or spray can, to be sure, but nevertheless words intended to convey meaning, slantwise \u2014 that is to say, poetry.A page of famous names (thought to be written around 1987) from one of the eight composition books on view at the Brooklyn Museum next month.In an unpublished essay in 1992, the late writer and artist Rene Ricard wrote: \u201cHad he reached artistic maturity at a slightly earlier (or later) time, Jean-Michel Basquiat would have manifested as a poet.\u201d Which slightly misses the point. That Basquiat was already a poet is manifest in these notebooks:KAYO IN THE LUNA PARKFREEZE FRAME ON A DRUNK IN THE PIAZZATHAT\u2019S WHAT WE HAVE FOR PIGEONSLUMBERING ON ASPHALT FACEDOWNLEAPSICKNESS THE LAW OF LIQUIDS.You can hear in those lines an echo of the Beats and the Black Arts Movement, and you can also hear the stabbing rhythm that carries over from his writing on walls to his paintings, which are about language before they are about anything else. As his friend Fred Brathwaite, a.k.a. Fab 5 Freddy, once said about the words on Basquiat\u2019s paintings, \u201cYou can hear Jean-Michel thinking\u201d:THERE\u2019S A SONG ON THE RADIOWHERE THEY SAY WAVY HAIR INSTEAD OF BLACKCONSIDERABLE CLOUDINESSSO IT WAS SUNG BY SOME WHITEGIRLS20 YEARS LATER.THE NOTEBOOKS\u2019 JUMBLE of entries variously sound like song lyrics, slogans, mantras, fragments of scenarios, of \u201croutines\u201d like those of William S. Burroughs \u2014 like everybody in those years, Basquiat\u2019s constantly sounding like Burroughs: \u201creally old shoes take trains with the minerals taped to their stomachs \u2014\u201d. Among their many other qualities, the notebooks are faithful artifacts of their time. (They reminded me of nothing as much as my own notebooks from that era.)Basquiat, who dropped out of high school, was an avid autodidact, picking up images, words and music everywhere he went, absorbing and applying them, sometimes immediately. He\u2019d glom diagrams from girlfriends\u2019 schoolbooks, ingredients from the sides of packages, signage from the streets (who remembers now when \u201cFlats Fixed\u201d was a phrase you\u2019d read every 10 minutes, walking around?). And, for that matter, in a work from 1987, the skeleton of \u201cMoby-Dick\u201d as revealed in its chapter titles, simply listed minus articles \u2014 \u201cLoomings, Carpet-Bag, Spouter-Inn, Counterpane, Breakfast, Street, Chapel. .\u2009.\u2009. \u201d \u2014 which has an insistent rhythm that Basquiat makes his own, that sounds like him.The poetry in the notebooks, fragmentary as it is, constitutes the raw material he would break down further for the paintings, in which phrases are replaced with words: single words, lists, scatterings, agglomerations. These are more efficient, and allow for more ambiguity. He liked to see words at play, populating the surface of a painting like signs on a busy street, their visual rhythm syncopated with their verbal percussion. The words form a diary and a map and a vast inventory of names and dates and lists and historical connections. Sometimes he sketched complex matters with remarkable economy \u2014 as in the 1983 painting that sets out the passage from Africa to slave ship to \u201cUndiscovered Genius of the Mississippi Delta\u201d as a kind of textbook page run riot \u2014 and sometimes he addressed more elusive matters in huge open-ended rebus-like structures. The notebooks were his laboratory and outflow, predictive less of the specific contents of paintings than of their overall gestalt. It is all flour from the same mill. Reading them puts you in the world of the paintings through sound alone:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Israel, Opera Echoes From Rocks and Ruins", "Date": "2015-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCultured TravelerThere had been far greater treasures uncovered atop this flat limestone monolith, where a band of Jewish rebels in A.D. 73 made a spectacular suicide pact and forever earned a place in the annals of Jewish lore. When excavation teams first came upon Masada in the 1960s, they found multicolored frescoes from Herod\u2019s thermal baths, crumbling storehouses still packed with grains and seeds, and ostraca (pottery shards) of every size and shade imaginable.But that image of a sailboat captivated Mr. Campbell. Decades later, when the Israeli Opera asked him to help pinpoint a location for an ambitious new summer festival, he found it by standing in the same spot as that soldier had and peering east.For one week each year, visitors to Masada National Park who stand where that ancient soldier did can see something else remarkable in the distance: an amphitheater on the Dead Sea\u2019s western bank, constructed to host the gutsiest opera festival in the Middle East.\u201cWe have stones here that are 3,000 years old,\u201d said Hanna Munitz, the director of the Israeli Opera. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame not to use them.\u201dMs. Munitz wanted to mount a summer opera festival in the Jewish state that would rival those of Salzburg and Verona. But Israel\u2019s opera tradition is young, and its performance halls are modest. So she decided to tap the nation\u2019s best resource \u2014 its history \u2014 in a bid to be competitive.Some 30,000 visitors attended the festival last year, injecting around 80 million shekels (about $20 million) into the Israeli economy, according to the tourism ministry. Most of them were Israeli, but a sliver (between 3,000 and 5,000) were foreigners who traveled to Israel specifically for the festival. It is this target audience that the opera has set its sights on.The Israel Ministry of Tourism has thrown in its support as well, allocating this year half a million U.S. dollars and sponsoring a marketing campaign in Europe, Russia and the United States.Two weeks later the action moves to Jerusalem, to the ancient Sultan\u2019s Pool beneath the ramparts of the Old City. On June 24 and 25, visitors will take in \u201cL\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore,\u201d Donizetti\u2019s slapstick tale of a peasant in love with a rich girl, from an arena built alongside a 2,000-year-old reservoir.Last year, Masada played host to \u201cLa Traviata.\u201d Staged amid a semi-ruined Paris, the set featured a stump of the Eiffel Tower, a crashed chandelier and a tilted, psychedelic version of Moulin Rouge\u2019s windmill.With a mountain like Masada looming in the background, an evening needs to be grand. So before festivalgoers even reached their seats, they strolled through a mock Parisian Avenue, dotted with bistros and patisseries and lit by hundreds of gracefully arched streetlights. At dusk, amid the pre-show chatter and the tinkling of thousands of wineglasses, it was almost possible to overlook the choking clouds of dust coughed up by tour buses rumbling nearby.\u201cThey built this festival out of nothing,\u201d said Daniel Oren, the Israeli-born conductor who serves as musical director for the Israeli Opera and who handled the baton for \u201cLa Traviata.\u201d \u201cAll of us artists, we are in tents in the desert, eating together, the choir, the stagehands, the orchestra, the singers. The atmosphere is like a kibbutz,\u201d he said, referring to Israel\u2019s socialistic collectives. \u201cIt\u2019s really emotional.\u201dA week after the close of the productions at Masada, I took the train from Tel Aviv to Acre, a creaking coastal city where fishermen cast their lines from a Crusader-era port. Here, inside the sweeping stone arches of what was once the headquarters of the Knights Hospitaller, the Israeli Opera Festival has a second stage, which opened in 2014.Inside the walls of the city\u2019s Crusader Courtyard, which, like Masada, is a Unesco World Heritage site, the opera staged \u201cDon Giovanni.\u201d (The festival\u2019s Acre epilogue has been pushed to September this year, with performances of \u201cLe Nozze di Figaro,\u201d as well as Mozart events geared toward children, scheduled for the weekend of Sept. 10 to 12.)The production was smaller, tighter in scale and more closely fitted to its surroundings. Acre has a sizable Muslim population, and a few minutes into Act I, as the commendatore lies in his own blood and Leporello and Giovanni contemplate a getaway, the muezzin of the mosque just behind the courtyard began his evening call to prayer.The conductor Daniel Cohen, the 31-year-old Israeli virtuoso who serves as a Gustavo Dudamel Fellow of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, cut the music. The players on stage froze. The audience, unsure of how to react, tittered with laughter and then just listened. As the call to prayer concluded, they applauded as if they had just heard an aria.Mr. Cohen snapped his baton, and the action resumed. It was all part of the plan.\u201c \u2018Don Giovanni\u2019 is a courtyard opera,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening in the backyards of houses and in courtyards, entrances and alleys. So in a way, doing it here, it feels very real. This place has a lovely balance between being a grand spectacle, but also an intimate environment.\u201dThere are no gilded ceilings here, no velvet seats. This is opera open to the elements, defying both sandstorms and humidity to make it to the stage. It comes each year and lights up the old stones, planting a new tradition amid the ruins.It\u2019s an odd juxtaposition, the soaring European librettos and crumbling Middle Eastern walls. But for a handful of hot summer nights, these desert settings become a curiously fitting venue for bel canto in a biblical land.IF YOU GOAt MasadaIn JerusalemIn AcreAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Oil Prices Fall, Houston Shudders ", "Date": "2015-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 LATELY \u2014 very lately \u2014 I\u2019ve started to enjoy driving by my neighborhood Kroger again. The boldly colored curbside sign has been showing an uptick in the price of gas in the last few weeks, from $1.75 a gallon to $1.91 to $2.11. In fancier parts of town, I\u2019ve even seen it hit $2.50.If I lived in Kansas or New York or California, this price rise would not be particularly good news. But I live in Houston \u2014 the energy capital of America, if not the planet \u2014 where even this tiny increase is cause for optimism. Maybe, I think, it won\u2019t be so bad this time, \u201cit\u201d being the predicted downturn that always comes when oil prices start to teeter.Despite well-intentioned talk by civic leaders about economic diversification, and by the oil companies about their \u201crisk management\u201d strategies, the inevitable highs and lows of the energy business continue to dominate my adopted hometown, not just economically but emotionally. Like a lot of Houstonians, I, for instance, have no personal stake in the business \u2014 no oil leases, no dividend coupons, no piece of a deal in Kazakhstan or even South Texas \u2014 but over the years I have grown accustomed to the dramatic highs and lows that cause tectonic shifts in this city\u2019s identity.I arrived in Houston during the oil boom of the late-1970s, when the Texas I had grown up in was only a few decades removed from backwater status. (Jett Rink, the rude, crude wildcatter James Dean played in the 1956 film \u201cGiant,\u201d based on the novel by Edna Ferber, did not spring entirely from her imagination.) But then, suddenly, skyscrapers by the likes of Philip Johnson and I. M. Pei started rising all over town. At Tony\u2019s restaurant, local notables hosted everyone from Mick Jagger to Princess Grace to Ernest Borgnine. The University of Houston even started a creative-writing program, a sure sign of the end of hickdom if ever there was one.No one cared that the freeways were clogged \u2014 frequently with \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Michigan \u2014 and that the air was as soupy and sticky as Beijing\u2019s is today, because we were all just biding our time until our well came in. And it would, of course, because oil, which had risen from around $10 a barrel in 1974 to about $38 in early 1980, was sure to hit $50. And then go even higher. Forever.It didn\u2019t. Instead, in the middle of that year, the price started trending in the opposite direction, thanks in part to OPEC nations that decided it was time to flood the world with cheap oil. By 1986 oil was selling below $20 a barrel, and the price slumped again after a slight rise in 1987.These were grim times, not only for people who lost their jobs at oil companies and related service industries, but for the very rich, some of whom became all too familiar with \u201cThe Chapter\u201d \u2014 as in the section of the bankruptcy code, not a novel. The most dunderheaded savings-and-loans went under, the officers having been a little too capacious in their lending. Local banks came under the control of national behemoths, trading hands so often that it became nearly impossible to keep track of the constantly renamed skyscrapers downtown. The see-through office building \u2014 an empty one \u2014 became a common sight along freeways. And of course there was shame and embarrassment \u2014 or, in Texas parlance, the thought that maybe we had gotten a little too big for our britches.As the narrative goes, chastened civic leaders encouraged the rest of the populace to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and diversify the economy. In fact, the next few upward and downward cycles were greeted here with welcoming shrugs and mild annoyance, respectively, rather like a longtime neighbor who drops in for coffee on a busy morning. There was a pretty bad \u201ccorrection\u201d in 2008-9 when oil plunged to $40 or so from nearly $140, but Houston came out O.K.Fortunately for Houston, and thanks largely to local know-how, came the combining of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, and the next big boom was on.Once again, the people who stood to profit most from high oil prices went nuts, but in a more sophisticated, understated way. They bought Teslas instead of Rolls-Royces, and second homes in Nantucket instead of Aspen, maybe because being Yankee-averse was so 1970s. Or maybe they simply represented a newer generation with less to prove, far removed from the curse of Jett Rink. At long last, local philanthropists spent their money not just on symphony halls and art museums \u2014 to show outsiders that we, too, had culture \u2014 but on parks and public health, making Houston a better place to live for those of us who stuck around.There are more newcomers than ever: about 1,550 new people a week by the latest reckoning, clogging the freeways and turning strip centers into international bazaars. These folks aren\u2019t just from Detroit: At the Ikea on any given Sunday, a Texas accent can\u2019t even begin to hold its own against Spanish, Chinese, Persian, Vietnamese, Arabic, French and the lilting intonations of several African nations.THEN, late last summer, the inevitable happened, as oil began another downward skid, because OPEC was, once again, refusing to cut production, playing a game of chicken against those who could not afford to drill as the price dropped \u2014 including, but not limited to, independent Texas producers. What\u2019s followed has been a collective intake of breath, accompanied with Jett Rink-style grimacing, and a lot of belt tightening. Familiar headlines like \u201cOil Job Losses Strike Home\u201d and \u201cOil Woes Hit Home,\u201d are back on The Houston Chronicle\u2019s front page.Layoffs have begun apace, particularly at oilfield service companies. Halliburton, for instance, recently announced that about 6,400 people would soon be losing their jobs. Schlumberger said it would lose 9,000 workers. \u201cTalk about a walk of shame,\u201d one of them told The Chronicle, after being ordered to clean out his desk and exit the building.Suddenly, too, announced donations to charity look a little iffy \u2014 \u201cthey\u2019re just pledges\u201d one fund-raiser noted \u2014 and restaurant expansions and mansion additions have been put on hold. Houston\u2019s traditionally cheap home prices, which last year were skyrocketing, are expected to level off, though it is still possible to witness desperate, multiple bids \u2014 in cash, of course \u2014 for the remaining River Oaks mansionettes currently on the market.Once again, it\u2019s a little easier to get a table in a hot Houston restaurant after 6 p.m. \u2014 assuming, of course, that you have the money to pay the tab.Pretty much one topic of conversation dominates: How long will the bad times last this go-round? The optimists here expect oil prices to rise by the end of the year. That they have already gone up a few percentage points in the last few weeks is maybe because of a) economic growth in Europe; b) more gasoline use as the start of spring approaches; c) the laws of supply and demand; d) production issues in Iraq and Libya; e) all of the above; or f) so much whistling in the dark.Jim, ol\u2019 buddy, I can hardly wait.Advertisement"}

Era veterano de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, pertenec\u00eda a la clase obrera y amaba a su familia por sobre todas las cosas, siempre se preocup\u00f3 por ella. Cargaba armas y, como muchos hombres de su generaci\u00f3n, ve\u00eda amenazas en la gente que no entend\u00eda: afroamericanos, mujeres independientes o gays.Pero para cuando muri\u00f3, diez a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, ya se hab\u00eda ablandado. Dej\u00f3 de lanzar insultos racistas y homof\u00f3bicos e incluso lleg\u00f3 a abrazar a mi primo gay. Pero hubo algo que nunca cambi\u00f3. No era tolerante con los hispanos y, nos dec\u00eda, que nunca se iba a retractar. Despu\u00e9s de todo no era cuesti\u00f3n de intolerancia sino de simple econom\u00eda: esos inmigrantes ven\u00edan a robarles el empleo a los \u201camericanos\u201d.\u00daltimamente he pensado en mi abuelo pues hay indicios de que, en 2015, podr\u00eda producirse una tregua \u2013 o al menos una reconfiguraci\u00f3n \u2013 en las pol\u00edticas de inmigraci\u00f3n. Varios de los posibles candidatos republicanos a la presidencia, entre ellos Jeb Bush, han expresado opiniones favorables a la inmigraci\u00f3n. Incluso los republicanos identificados con el Tea Party responden, tres a dos, en favor de una v\u00eda a la ciudadan\u00eda para los inmigrantes indocumentados. Casi todos los dem\u00e1s grupos \u2013 republicanos en general, independientes y sobre todo dem\u00f3cratas \u2013 b\u00e1sicamente est\u00e1n a favor de los inmigrantes.Seg\u00fan el Centro Pew, en 2010 el 18 por ciento de los estadounidenses pensaba que el Presidente Obama era musulm\u00e1n, mismo porcentaje que ahora piensa que todos los inmigrantes indocumentados deben ser expulsados de los Estados Unidos. Ese 18 por ciento puede ser muy ruidoso pero, para todos los dem\u00e1s, la inmigraci\u00f3n parece seguir el mismo camino que el matrimonio homosexual, la marihuana y el corte punk de mohicano: algo que escandaliza a un pu\u00f1ado de personas pero que los dem\u00e1s aceptaron desde hace tiempo.Si ara\u00f1amos la superficie descubrimos r\u00e1pidamente que muchos estadounidenses est\u00e1n cerca de pensar como mi abuelo; m\u00e1s cerca de lo que quieren admitir. No me estoy refiriendo al \u00e1nimo racial sino a la fallida l\u00f3gica econ\u00f3mica. Generalmente apoyamos la inmigraci\u00f3n cuando los inmigrantes son diferentes a nosotros. A la clase media y alta no le importa que inmigrantes con un bajo nivel de estudios y poco calificados entren en el pa\u00eds.Los beneficios econ\u00f3micos de la inmigraci\u00f3n quiz\u00e1 sean el hecho mejor establecido en la econom\u00eda. Un reciente sondeo de la Universidad de Chicago entre economistas destacados no pudo encontrar uno solo que rechazara la propuesta. (Hubo un solo notable economista que no fue entrevistado: George Borjas de Harvard, quien cree que sus colegas economistas subestiman el costo de la inmigraci\u00f3n para los nativos no capacitados. Los activistas antiinmigrantes suelen apoyarse en los trabajos de Borjas, tal como se invocan complicados resultados de meteorolog\u00eda como \u201cprueba\u201d de que el calentamiento global es un mito). Hablando con racionalidad, deber\u00edamos admitir muchos m\u00e1s inmigrantes que en la actualidad.Entonces, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no nos abrimos? El principal error l\u00f3gico que cometemos se llama falacia de la escasez del trabajo: es la noci\u00f3n err\u00f3nea de que solo hay una cantidad fija de trabajo por hacer y nadie puede obtener un empleo sin quit\u00e1rselo a alguien m\u00e1s. Es un supuesto comprensible. Despu\u00e9s de todo, en otro tipo de transacciones del mercado cuando aumenta la demanda, el precio se reduce. Si de pronto hubiera un mont\u00f3n m\u00e1s de naranjas, esperar\u00edamos que se redujera el precio de esa fruta, o que aumentara el n\u00famero de naranjas que se quedan sin consumir.Pero los inmigrantes no son naranjas. Podr\u00eda parecer l\u00f3gico que cuando hay un aumento en la oferta de trabajadores, quienes ya tienen empleo ganar\u00edan menos o perder\u00edan su trabajo. Pero los inmigrantes no solo incrementan la oferta de mano de obra; al mismo tiempo incrementan su demanda, usando los salarios que devengan para rentar departamentos, comprar alimentos, cortarse el pelo o comprar tel\u00e9fonos celulares, entre muchas otras cosas.Eso significa que hay m\u00e1s puestos de trabajo para construir departamentos, vender comida, cortar el pelo y despachar los camiones que transportan los celulares. Los inmigrantes aumentan el tama\u00f1o de la poblaci\u00f3n general, lo que significa que tambi\u00e9n incrementan la econom\u00eda.L\u00f3gicamente, si los inmigrantes estuvieran \u201crobando\u201d empleos, lo mismo har\u00eda cualquier estadounidense que sale de la escuela para ingresar en el mercado de trabajo; los pa\u00edses se volver\u00edan m\u00e1s pobres conforme creciera su poblaci\u00f3n. Pero, por supuesto, en la realidad sucede todo lo contrario.La evidencia m\u00e1s grande que refuta la idea de la escasez de trabajo viene de la investigaci\u00f3n sobre el \u00e9xodo de Mariel, una emigraci\u00f3n masiva en los a\u00f1os 80 que trajo a 125.000 cubanos a Estados Unidos. Seg\u00fan David Card, economista de la Universidad de California en Berkeley, m\u00e1s o menos 45.000 de ellos estaban en edad de trabajar y se fueron a Miami. En cuatro meses, la oferta de mano de obra de la ciudad aument\u00f3 en 7 por ciento. Card encontr\u00f3 que esta s\u00fabita llegada no tuvo ning\u00fan efecto mensurable en los salarios o el empleo de quienes ya estaban trabajando en Miami. Su estudio fue el m\u00e1s importante de una serie de estudios revolucionarios que transformaron los conceptos de los economistas sobre la inmigraci\u00f3n.Antes, los modelos econ\u00f3micos est\u00e1ndar sosten\u00edan que los inmigrantes causaban beneficios de largo plazo, pero a costa de dificultades de corto plazo como salarios bajos y mayor desempleo para los nativos. Pero ahora la mayor\u00eda de los economistas piensan que los hallazgos de Card son correctos: los inmigrantes aportan beneficios a largo plazo sin costos mensurables de corto plazo. (Borjas, la solitaria voz disidente, admite los beneficios de largo plazo pero asegura que sus colegas no ven los dolorosos costos de corto plazo, especialmente para los pobres).Los economistas se han dedicado a estudiar c\u00f3mo se ajustan los pa\u00edses a los reci\u00e9n llegados. El acad\u00e9mico m\u00e1s destacado en esta materia es Giovanni Peri, de la Universidad de California, que demostr\u00f3 que los inmigrantes tienden a complementar la mano de obra existente, y no llegan a competir con ella. Veamos el caso de una obra en construcci\u00f3n: Peri descubri\u00f3 que generalmente, inmigrantes con pocos estudios realizan muchas tareas de apoyo (trasladar cosas pesadas, verter cemento, barrer, pintar) mientras que ciudadanos con m\u00e1s capacitaci\u00f3n se centran en el trabajo calificado como carpinter\u00eda, plomer\u00eda e instalaciones el\u00e9ctricas, as\u00ed como las relaciones con los clientes.El nativo calificado puede dedicarse a las tareas m\u00e1s valiosas, mientras que los inmigrantes le ayudan a reducir el costo de la obra en general (cuesta mucho pagarle a un carpintero, muy calificado, para que barra el suelo). Peri sostiene, con evidencias s\u00f3lidas, que ahora hay m\u00e1s oficiales nativos calificados trabajando, no menos, gracias a todos esos trabajadores indocumentados. En Wall Street puede observarse una din\u00e1mica similar. Muchas tareas de soporte t\u00e9cnico est\u00e1n dominadas por los inmigrantes recientes, mientras que las ventas, la mercadotecnia, asesor\u00eda y transacciones, que requieren dominio cultural y ling\u00fc\u00edstico, generalmente son el \u00e1mbito de los nativos. (Decidir si, a fin de cuentas, los magos t\u00e9cnicos de Wall Street han ayudado o da\u00f1ado a la econom\u00eda es tema para otro d\u00eda).Esta paradoja de la inmigraci\u00f3n est\u00e1 asociada con la paradoja del crecimiento econ\u00f3mico mismo. En los \u00faltimos tiempos el crecimiento ha adquirido mala fama entre ciertos sectores, especialmente de la izquierda, que relacionan el t\u00e9rmino con la destrucci\u00f3n del ambiente y el aumento de las desigualdades. Pero el crecimiento a trav\u00e9s de la inmigraci\u00f3n es un crecimiento con desventajas notablemente peque\u00f1as. Cada vez que un inmigrante llega a Estados Unidos, el mundo se vuelve un poco m\u00e1s rico. Pese a todas sus fallas, Estados Unidos sigue siendo mucho m\u00e1s desarrollado econ\u00f3micamente que la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses, ciertamente m\u00e1s que las naciones que dejan la mayor\u00eda de nuestros inmigrantes.Nuestro sistema jur\u00eddico junto a la infraestructura financiera y f\u00edsica tambi\u00e9n son superiores a la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses (por sorprendente que esto pueda parecernos). As\u00ed pues, cuando alguien deja atr\u00e1s una econom\u00eda en desarrollo y pone el pie en suelo estadounidense, generalmente se vuelve m\u00e1s productivo en t\u00e9rminos econ\u00f3micos. Gana m\u00e1s dinero, alcanza un nivel de vida superior y genera para el mundo un mayor valor econ\u00f3mico que si se hubiera quedado en casa.Si fu\u00e9ramos a reemplazar nuestro costoso y restrictivo sistema de loter\u00eda de visas por uno de fronteras abiertas, es probable que muchos de esos inmigrantes ir\u00edan y vendr\u00edan de sus pa\u00edses de origen, contrarrestando as\u00ed la fuga de cerebros al impartir sus conocimientos e invertir su capital. En t\u00e9rminos del ambiente, la inmigraci\u00f3n tiende a ser menos da\u00f1ina que otras formas de crecimiento, pues no aumenta el n\u00famero de personas en la Tierra y solo las redistribuye a jurisdicciones m\u00e1s amables con el ambiente.Para m\u00ed, la inmigraci\u00f3n es el mejor ejemplo de nuestro razonamiento fallido, una miop\u00eda que da\u00f1a a otros al mismo tiempo que nos perjudica a nosotros mismos. El Departamento de Estado emite menos de medio mill\u00f3n de visas de inmigrante al a\u00f1o. Bas\u00e1ndonos en la cifra de 7 por ciento que se desprende de la investigaci\u00f3n del \u00e9xodo de Mariel, es posible que pudi\u00e9ramos absorber hasta 11 millones de inmigrantes al a\u00f1o. Pero si eso es pol\u00edticamente insostenible, \u00bfqu\u00e9 tal que se duplicara el n\u00famero de visas emitidas cada a\u00f1o? Seguir\u00edan siendo menos de un mill\u00f3n, es decir, menos del 0.7 por ciento de la fuerza de trabajo. Si eso no resultara mal, podr\u00eda duplicarse la cifra al a\u00f1o siguiente. Los datos son claros. Estar\u00edamos mejor; de hecho, el mundo estar\u00eda mejor.Siempre que tengo la tentaci\u00f3n de pensar que los humanos son seres racionales, que eval\u00faan cuidadosamente al mundo y act\u00faan de maneras que incremente su felicidad, pienso en nuestras mediocres pol\u00edticas de inmigraci\u00f3n. Para m\u00ed son casi una prueba de que, colectivamente, seguimos siendo criaturas celosas y nerviosas, acumulando lo que tenemos, temerosas de incurrir en los riesgos m\u00e1s promisorios, manifestando lealtad a nuestra propia tribu mientras miramos con suspicacia a todos los dem\u00e1s. Es bonito creer que soy parte de una generaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s madura y racional en las que mentalidades como las de mi abuelo est\u00e1n desapareciendo por muerte natural. Pero no estoy tan seguro. Quiz\u00e1 somos m\u00e1s parecidos a mi abuelo de lo que queremos creer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Desbancando o mito do imigrante que rouba empregos", "Date": "2015-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAm\u00e9rica Quando eu era adolescente, l\u00e1 pelos anos 1980, via meu av\u00f4 \u2013 padrasto do meu pai \u2013 lutando contra seus pr\u00f3prios preconceitos. Veterano da Segunda Guerra Mundial, era da classe oper\u00e1ria e amava sua fam\u00edlia acima de tudo e sempre temia por ela. Andava armado e, como muitos homens da sua gera\u00e7\u00e3o, sentia-se amea\u00e7ado pelas pessoas que n\u00e3o entendia: afro-americanos, mulheres independentes ou gays. Quando morreu, dez anos atr\u00e1s, j\u00e1 estava bem menos \u00e1spero. Deixou de lan\u00e7ar insultos racistas e homof\u00f3bicos e at\u00e9 chegou a abra\u00e7ar meu primo gay. Mas tinha um ponto em que nunca mudaria: n\u00e3o aceitava hisp\u00e2nicos, e nisso, dizia ele, nunca iria recuar. Afinal, n\u00e3o era uma quest\u00e3o de intoler\u00e2ncia, tratava-se de uma quest\u00e3o meramente econ\u00f4mica: esses imigrantes estavam roubando os empregos dos \u201camericanos\u201d.Ainda assim, o benef\u00edcio econ\u00f4mico trazido pela imigra\u00e7\u00e3o talvez seja o fato mais bem estabelecido da ci\u00eancia econ\u00f4mica. Um recente levantamento feito pela Universidade de Chicago entre os economistas mais destacados n\u00e3o encontrou um s\u00f3 que rejeitasse a proposi\u00e7\u00e3o. (Houve um economista not\u00e1vel que n\u00e3o foi entrevistado: George Borjas, de Harvard, que acredita que seus colegas subestimam o custo da imigra\u00e7\u00e3o para os nativos com baixo n\u00edvel de qualifica\u00e7\u00e3o. O trabalho de Borjas \u00e9 frequentemente mal utilizado por ativistas anti-imigra\u00e7\u00e3o, da mesma forma que uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o muito clara entre ci\u00eancia e clima muitas vezes \u00e9 invocada como \u201cprova\u201d de que o aquecimento global \u00e9 um mito.) Racionalmente falando, dever\u00edamos deixar entrar muito mais imigrantes do que atualmente fazemos.Mas imigrantes n\u00e3o s\u00e3o laranjas. Pode parecer intuitivo que, quando h\u00e1 um aumento da oferta de trabalhadores, os que j\u00e1 estavam aqui passem a ganhar menos dinheiro ou percam seus empregos. Por\u00e9m, os imigrantes n\u00e3o se limitam a aumentar a oferta de m\u00e3o de obra, pois ao mesmo tempo tamb\u00e9m aumentam a sua demanda, quando usam seus sal\u00e1rios para alugar apartamentos, comer, cortar o cabelo, comprar celulares. Isso significa que haver\u00e1 mais empregos na constru\u00e7\u00e3o civil, vendendo comida, fazendo cortes de cabelo ou dirigindo os caminh\u00f5es que transportam os telefones. Os imigrantes aumentam o tamanho do total da popula\u00e7\u00e3o, portanto aumentam o tamanho da economia. Pela l\u00f3gica, se os imigrantes \u201croubam\u201d os empregos, a mesma coisa estaria fazendo cada jovem que sai da escola e entra no mercado de trabalho. Ent\u00e3o, os pa\u00edses deveriam ficar mais pobres \u00e0 medida que a popula\u00e7\u00e3o cresce. Na realidade, \u00e9 claro, acontece o contr\u00e1rio.A maioria dos argumentos anti-imigra\u00e7\u00e3o que ou\u00e7o s\u00e3o varia\u00e7\u00f5es da Fal\u00e1cia da Escassez do Trabalho. \u201cEsse imigrante tem um trabalho. Se n\u00e3o o tivesse, outra pessoa, algu\u00e9m nascido aqui, o teria\u201d. Este argumento est\u00e1 errado, ou pelo menos violentamente simplificado. Mas parece t\u00e3o correto, t\u00e3o l\u00f3gico. E n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 gente como meu av\u00f4 que usa esse argumento, a nossa pol\u00edtica governamental est\u00e1 enraizada nele.A maior prova que refuta a ideia da Fal\u00e1cia da Escassez do Trabalho vem de um estudo sobre o \u00eaxodo mar\u00edtimo de Mariel, uma migra\u00e7\u00e3o em massa acontecida em 1980 que levou mais de 125 mil cubanos para os Estados Unidos. Segundo David Card, economista da Universidade da Calif\u00f3rnia em Berkeley, por volta de 45 mil deles estavam em idade produtiva e se mudaram para Miami. Em quatro meses, a oferta de trabalho na cidade aumentou em 7%. Card constatou que, para as pessoas que j\u00e1 trabalhavam em Miami, este s\u00fabito afluxo n\u00e3o teve qualquer impacto mensur\u00e1vel sobre seus sal\u00e1rios ou empregos. Seu trabalho foi o mais importante de uma s\u00e9rie de estudos revolucion\u00e1rios que transformaram o pensamento dos economistas sobre a imigra\u00e7\u00e3o. Antes, o padr\u00e3o dos modelos econ\u00f4micos considerava que os imigrantes traziam benef\u00edcios no longo prazo, mas \u00e0 custa de preju\u00edzos no curto prazo, na forma de sal\u00e1rios mais baixos e desemprego para os cidad\u00e3os locais. Mas hoje, a maioria dos economistas aceita as conclus\u00f5es de Card como corretas: imigrantes trazem benef\u00edcios no longo prazo sem custos mensur\u00e1veis no curto prazo. (Borjas, a solit\u00e1ria voz dissidente, concorda quanto aos benef\u00edcios no longo prazo, mas argumenta que os outros economistas deixam de ver os sofridos custos a curto prazo, especialmente para os pobres.)Os economistas passaram a estudar como as na\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00eam feito para rapidamente ajustar-se aos rec\u00e9m-chegados. O principal estudioso do assunto hoje \u00e9 Giovanni Peri, da Universidade da Calif\u00f3rnia em Davis, que demonstrou que os imigrantes tendem a complementar \u2013 em vez de competir contra \u2013 a for\u00e7a de trabalho preexistente. Tome-se um canteiro de obra: tipicamente, constatou Peri, imigrantes com educa\u00e7\u00e3o limitada executam muitas tarefas de apoio (movendo cargas pesadas, misturando cimento, varrendo e pintando), enquanto o pessoal com mais forma\u00e7\u00e3o se concentra nos trabalhos mais qualificados como carpintaria, instala\u00e7\u00f5es el\u00e9tricas e hidr\u00e1ulicas e no atendimento aos clientes. O nativo mais qualificado pode se concentrar em tarefas mais valorizadas, enquanto os imigrantes ajudam a baixar o pre\u00e7o global do projeto (custa caro pagar a um carpinteiro altamente treinado por varrer o lugar de trabalho). Peri afirma, com robusta comprova\u00e7\u00e3o, que hoje trabalham mais cidad\u00e3os nativos qualificados, e n\u00e3o menos, exatamente por causa de todos esses trabalhadores irregulares. Uma din\u00e2mica similar vem acontecendo em Wall Street, onde muitas das tarefas de apoio t\u00e9cnico s\u00e3o feitas principalmente por imigrantes recentes, enquanto que vendas, marketing, assessoramento e com\u00e9rcio, que requerem fluidez lingu\u00edstica e cultural, s\u00e3o tipicamente os dom\u00ednios dos cidad\u00e3os locais. (Se, no c\u00f4mputo geral, os magos tecn\u00f3logos de Wall Street t\u00eam ajudado ou prejudicado a economia \u00e9 quest\u00e3o para outro dia.)Esse paradoxo da imigra\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 ligado ao paradoxo do pr\u00f3prio crescimento econ\u00f4mico. O crescimento adquiriu m\u00e1 reputa\u00e7\u00e3o nos \u00faltimos tempos entre alguns, principalmente \u00e0 esquerda, que associam o termo com a destrui\u00e7\u00e3o do meio-ambiente e o aumento da desigualdade. Mas o crescimento por imigra\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 um crescimento com not\u00e1vel aus\u00eancia de desvantagens. Cada vez que um imigrante entra nos Estados Unidos o mundo fica um pouco mais rico. Apesar de todos nossos defeitos, os Estados Unidos ainda s\u00e3o economicamente bem mais desenvolvidos que a maioria dos pa\u00edses, certamente mais do que aqueles que os imigrantes deixaram. Nosso sistema legal, nossa infraestrutura f\u00edsica e financeira tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 muito superior \u00e0 maioria (por mais surpreendente que isso possa, \u00e0s vezes, nos parecer). Assim, quando as pessoas deixam as economias em desenvolvimento e colocam o p\u00e9 no solo dos Estados Unidos, tipicamente se tornam mais produtivas, em termos econ\u00f4micos. Ganham mais dinheiro, atingem um n\u00edvel de vida melhor e agregam mais valor econ\u00f4mico ao mundo do que teriam, se tivessem ficado em casa. Se as fronteiras fossem abertas em substitui\u00e7\u00e3o ao nosso caro e restritivo sistema de sorteio, \u00e9 prov\u00e1vel que muitos desses imigrantes viajassem indo e voltando entre os Estados Unidos e seus pa\u00edses de origem, neutralizando a potencial fuga de c\u00e9rebros atrav\u00e9s da partilha de conhecimentos e do capital de investimento. Ambientalmente, a imigra\u00e7\u00e3o tende a ser menos prejudicial que outras formas de crescimento, pois n\u00e3o aumenta o n\u00famero de pessoas no mundo e muitas vezes desloca as pessoas para jurisdi\u00e7\u00f5es mais favor\u00e1veis ao meio-ambiente.Toda vez que sou tentado pela ideia de que os humanos s\u00e3o seres racionais, que avaliam cuidadosamente o mundo e agem de maneira a maximizar nossa felicidade, penso em nossas acanhadas pol\u00edticas de imigra\u00e7\u00e3o. Para mim, isso \u00e9 quase que uma prova de que ainda somos, coletivamente, ciumentos, criaturas nervosas, acumulando o que temos, com medo at\u00e9 de correr o risco mais promissor, jurando lealdade \u00e0 nossa pr\u00f3pria tribo enquanto fixamos o olhar, desconfiados, em todos os outros. \u00c9 gostoso acreditar que fa\u00e7o parte de uma gera\u00e7\u00e3o mais madura e racional, que as velhas formas de pensar do meu av\u00f4 est\u00e3o se extinguindo. Mas n\u00e3o tenho tanta certeza. Podemos ser muito mais parecidos com ele do que gostar\u00edamos de pensar.Adam Davidson \u00e9 fundador do programa de r\u00e1dio \u201cPlanet Money\u201d (Planeta Dinheiro) da NPR (R\u00e1dio P\u00fablica Nacional) e colaborador desta revista.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pepperoni Turns Partisan", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you want to know what a political party really stands for, follow the money. Pundits and the public are often deceived; remember when George W. Bush was a moderate, and Chris Christie a reasonable guy who could reach out to Democrats? Major donors, however, generally have a very good idea of what they are buying, so tracking their spending tells you a lot.Why should pizza, of all things, be a divisive issue? The immediate answer is that it has been caught up in the nutrition wars. America\u2019s body politic has gotten a lot heavier over the past half-century, and, while there is dispute about the causes, an unhealthy diet \u2014 fast food in particular \u2014 is surely a prime suspect. As Bloomberg notes, some parts of the food industry have responded to pressure from government agencies and food activists by trying to offer healthier options, but the pizza sector has chosen instead to take a stand for the right to add extra cheese.The rhetoric of this fight is familiar. The pizza lobby portrays itself as the defender of personal choice and personal responsibility. It\u2019s up to the consumer, so the argument goes, to decide what he or she wants to eat, and we don\u2019t need a nanny state telling us what to do.It\u2019s an argument many people find persuasive, but it doesn\u2019t hold up too well once you look at what\u2019s actually at stake in the pizza disputes. Nobody is proposing a ban on pizza, or indeed any limitation on what informed adults should be allowed to eat. Instead, the fights involve things like labeling requirements \u2014 giving consumers the information to make informed choices \u2014 and the nutritional content of school lunches, that is, food decisions that aren\u2019t made by responsible adults but are instead made on behalf of children.Beyond that, anyone who has struggled with weight issues \u2014 which means, surely, the majority of American adults \u2014 knows that this is a domain where the easy rhetoric of \u201cfree to choose\u201d rings hollow. Even if you know very well that you will soon regret that extra slice, it\u2019s extremely hard to act on that knowledge. Nutrition, where increased choice can be a bad thing, because it all too often leads to bad choices despite the best of intentions, is one of those areas \u2014 like smoking \u2014 where there\u2019s a lot to be said for a nanny state.But you shouldn\u2019t expect such arguments to gain much traction. For one thing, free-market fundamentalists don\u2019t want to hear about qualifications to their doctrine. Also, with big corporations involved, the Upton Sinclair principle applies: It\u2019s difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it. And beyond all that, it turns out that nutritional partisanship taps into deeper cultural issues. At a still deeper level, health experts may say that we need to change how we eat, pointing to scientific evidence, but the Republican base doesn\u2019t much like experts, science, or evidence. Debates about nutrition policy bring out a kind of venomous anger \u2014 much of it now directed at Michelle Obama, who has been championing school lunch reforms \u2014 that is all too familiar if you\u2019ve been following the debate over climate change. Pizza partisanship, then, sounds like a joke, but it isn\u2019t. It is, instead, a case study in the toxic mix of big money, blind ideology, and popular prejudices that is making America ever less governable. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Explains Brazil\u2019s Surfing Boom?", "Date": "2015-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionBRAZIL has gone surf crazy.In December, when a 20-year-old Brazilian named Gabriel Medina won the world\u2019s premier surfing title, becoming the first South American man to do so, the country erupted in celebration. Mr. Medina\u2019s path to the championship had been followed closely in Brazil throughout 2014, each victory celebrated in typically boisterous Brazilian fashion by flag-waving, often teary, always emotional fans. His arrival at the airport in S\u00e3o Paulo after winning the title was a mob scene and a media frenzy.But Mr. Medina is only the most visible exponent of a rising generation of surfers known by the collective moniker \u201cthe Brazilian Storm.\u201d This year, seven of the 34 male contenders on the championship tour are Brazilian \u2014 a striking percentage in a sport long dominated by Australians, Americans and South Africans. The first event of the year, which ended earlier this month in Australia, was won by a 19-year-old Brazilian named Filipe Toledo. Four of the final eight contenders were Brazilian.Brazil has more than 4,000 miles of coastline, and Brazilians have been surfing its waves at least since the Australian surfer Peter Troy gave a demonstration in Rio de Janeiro in 1964. So why the sudden dominance?The answer is that the country itself has changed. Following the rocky decades of the 1980s and \u201990s, when financial shocks and political instability battered the economy and inflation reached peaks of more than 2,000 percent a year, Brazil in the 2000s experienced more than a decade of stability and growth. The abysmal gap between rich and poor narrowed a little, and the middle class ballooned from about 15 percent of the population in the early \u201980s to nearly a third by 2012.What did this have to do with surfing? Everything.As the sport\u2019s popularity rose in the 1970s and \u201980s, Brazilians became serious about surfing, but with a few exceptions they didn\u2019t make it big. A large continental shelf in the Atlantic means that there is not a single first-rate \u201cbreak\u201d along Brazil\u2019s coastline. To be really good, a Brazilian surfer needs to develop proficiency on more than those gutless waves; he needs the storied breaks of Hawaii, Indonesia or Tahiti, which produce large and powerful surf. For decades, it was the rare Brazilian who could afford to travel to such places. When Brazilian surfers did travel abroad, they usually went without much support, money or technical assistance. They spoke broken English and had little international experience. And there was a culture clash: They developed a reputation as loud, obnoxious and aggressive, heedless of surfing etiquette. This stereotype (still the subject of heated debate) kept them out of favor with dominant surfers, foreign fans and specialized media.As a country, too, Brazil played fast and loose with the rules. When the demand for surf gear grew in the \u201980s, pirated T-shirts, board shorts and wet suits became ubiquitous. Little was done in Brazil to combat this, leaving some of the most powerful chief executives in the business feeling cheated \u2014 and less likely to sponsor a Brazilian surfer.But today\u2019s generation of Brazilian surfers came up during Brazil\u2019s decade of growth, and they have had support along the way. They\u2019ve been going to places like Hawaii regularly and developing into more complete athletes. Someone like Mr. Medina is very much the face of the new Brazilian middle class.\u00a0His mother worked as a waitress and a maid, among other jobs; his stepfather, a former triathlete, was his coach. The Medinas lived off the income of a surfing goods store. They were Gabriel\u2019s main source of support \u2014 financial, emotional and technical \u2014 until he signed his first sponsorship deal at 13.Mr. Medina\u2019s success will presumably help the next generation of young surfers more easily get sponsors. This would be good for Brazil, but it would also be good for the insular, overwhelmingly white world of professional surfing; Brazilian surfing has brought black faces into the sport\u2019s elite circles.But Brazil has hit a rough patch. Inflation is back up, the gross domestic product has been middling for years and corruption scandals are rampant. This economic downturn is already hurting Brazilians, and seems to have reached Brazilian surfing as well. Brazil had a national surfing championship called Super Surf, from 2000 to 2009. Over the next few years there were changes in sponsors and in name. By 2014 there was not enough support to stage a national competition, and the national champion was decided merely by adding up the points from state competitions.Mr. Medina\u2019s victory at the end of 2014 seems to have helped momentarily re-establish the national championship, for a trial period of two years. But no single athlete \u2014 or even an entire Brazilian Storm \u2014 can counter the overall lack of support for professional athletes (excluding soccer players) that has been endemic to Brazil and that will most likely increase following any serious economic decline.If the economy does continue to suffer, however, there may be a higher power to which Brazilian surfers can still appeal. In January, the Vatican allowed priests in Rio de Janeiro to gather evidence of the holiness of Guido Schaffer, a popular young priest-in-training and avid surfer who drowned in a surfing accident in 2009. This is an early step in the sainthood process, and Mr. Schaffer, now referred to by locals as the \u201csurfer angel,\u201d has been credited with miraculous deeds. Perhaps preserving the greatness of Brazilian surfing will one day be counted among them.Advertisement"}

St. Martin", "Date": "2015-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real EstateThe 3,700-square-foot villa, called Mille Fleurs, is in the gated Terres Basses development in French St. Martin. The other side of the island, St. Maarten, is Dutch.A FOUR-BEDROOM VILLA IN TERRES BASSES$3.9 MILLION (3.4 MILLION EUROS) This 3,700-square-foot house, known as Mille Fleurs, or Thousand Flowers in French, is set on two and a half walled, rolling acres lush with palms, flamboyant trees, bougainvillea and hibiscus. Situated just above Plum Bay, the villa, which has four bedrooms and four and a half baths, enjoys sweeping views of the Caribbean and the islands of Saba and Anguilla, said Lesley Reed, the broker-owner of St. Martin Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, which has the listing.The eggshell-hued painted concrete villa, with sand-colored shutters and a cedar shingle roof, was built in the mid-1980s. It is reached through a large iron gate and up a circular driveway with a separate exit gate. Tall windows wrap the foyer on three sides. Steps lead down to a living room with a 16-foot vaulted ceiling with exposed beams, a terra-cotta tile floor and arched French doors opening to a columned veranda. Dual seating clusters with wood-framed off-white sofas are complemented by a tapestry and an ornate mirror. The outdoor dining room, shaded by an awning, has a 15-foot glass dining table that seats 10. The home is being sold furnished. To one side of the living room, the fully equipped kitchen has brick-red walls, white wood cabinetry, stainless-steel appliances, a breakfast bar with a brown granite countertop and a small outdoor dining area on the covered terrace. A laundry room has two washers and two dryers.Beyond the kitchen, the master suite opens through French doors onto a private outdoor sitting area.

To the other side of the living room, each of three additional bedrooms has its own flat-screen television, DVD player and iPod docking station, as well as an en-suite tiled bathroom. The bedrooms are air-conditioned; two open onto the terrace. The house is equipped with high-speed wireless Internet.The terra cotta and concrete terrace, running the length of the house, faces a rectangular swimming pool with an infinity edge toward the sea. To one side is a gazebo with lounge chairs, sofas and a coffee table.The house rents for $4,000 a week during the low season, from April 15 to Dec. 14. The high season rate of $9,000 weekly jumps to $15,000 for Christmas and New Year\u2019s weeks, Ms. Reed said. The property also includes a separate one-bedroom caretaker\u2019s apartment.The house is in the guarded, gated residential development of Terres Basses, or Lowlands, which has 320 lots of 2.4 or more acres and is 90 percent built. It is on the northern side of the cosmopolitan, 37-square-mile island, which is divided into French St. Martin and Dutch St. Maarten. From the villa, it is a quick stroll to secluded Plum Bay beach, and residents can also easily access the cabanas and water sports at the exclusive Belmond La Samanna resort and spa in the Lowlands area. A third nearby beach, Baie Rouge, offers a small restaurant.The island has more than 300 restaurants, duty-free shopping and 37 white sand beaches. About 41,000 people live on the Dutch side, and 36,000 on the French side.MARKET OVERVIEWWhen the world economy soured in 2008, the market \u201cwent flat,\u201d Ms. Reed said. \u201cThe prices didn\u2019t drop, but nothing sold.\u201d In the last six months, business has picked up and \u201cis better this year than it was last year. The market is coming back.\u201d On the French side, the luxury market starts at $1.5 million and escalates to $17.5 million for an 11-bedroom 11-bath cliffside property on five acres. With less available beachfront property on the Dutch side, prices top out at $5 million, said Hanneke Snow, the broker-owner of Re/Max Island Properties. \u201cThere are more luxurious properties on the French side because of the Lowlands.\u201d Inventory is high, said Maayke Martina, the broker-owner of Antilles Realty, though oceanfront property is scarce. The strongest segment of the market is from $500,000 to $1 million. Most buyers pay cash, but for buyers with a 50 percent down payment, local banks issue mortgages with an interest rate of 5 percent to 7.5 percent.Sherrylle DeHaarte, the broker-owner of Coldwell Banker Real Estate St. Maarten, said the market on the Dutch side, which has condominiums and townhomes as well as private homes, was \u201cmore vibrant\u201d than on the French side. Across the island, even when homes languished on the market, the vacation rental market stayed strong. \u201cPeople went on vacation, they just weren\u2019t buying the million-dollar condos,\u201d Ms. DeHaarte said. The pressure to sell a property is mitigated by the ease of renting it. \u201cIf you find yourself in financial distress, you put it on the short-term rental market,\u201d where it can fetch $2,000 or more a week, depending on its location, she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go wrong.\u201d WHO BUYS IN ST. MARTINA flight of around four hours from New York, the island draws winter visitors seeking a week or a long weekend in the sun from the East Coast as well as from cities in other parts of the country offering direct flights, such as Chicago and Atlanta. Europeans, particularly from France, Holland, Austria, Germany and Belgium, are more likely to spend a month on the island in the summer, Ms. Reed said. BUYING BASICS\u201cThere are absolutely no restrictions for foreign buyers,\u201d said Thierry Collanges, a notary based in St. Martin. On both the French and Dutch sides, a notary does the title search. \u201cA notary deed is compulsory \u2014 the notary must draw up the deed and receive payment for any tax connected with the purchase,\u201d Mr. Collanges said. A separate lawyer is not needed. WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESFrench (on St. Martin) and Dutch (on St. Maarten), with English widely spoken on both sides; euro on the French side, Netherlands Antillean guilder on the Dutch side (1 euro = $1.06; 1 Netherlands Antillean guilder = $0.56). The United States dollar is widely accepted throughout the island. TAXES AND FEESProperty taxes on this home are about $5,000 a year, and there is an annual association fee of about $2,000, Ms. Reed said.In French St. Martin, an 8 percent transfer tax is levied on the purchase price. Notary fees for drawing up the necessary deed cost roughly 1.2 percent to 2 percent of the purchase price \u201cdepending on the distinctive features of the transaction,\u201d Mr. Collanges said. On the Dutch side, transfer fees run about 6 percent. While there are no property taxes, income tax is charged if the property is rented out, said Ms. Martina of Antilles Realty. Real estate commissions, paid by the seller, vary across the island, ranging from around 5 percent to 10 percent. CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "McConnell Urges States to Defy U.S. Plan to Cut Greenhouse Gas", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and majority leader, is urging governors to defy President Obama by refusing to implement the administration\u2019s global warming regulations.As Mr. Obama pushes an aggressive climate change agenda, the Environmental Protection Agency has proposed regulations to slash greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants, the nation\u2019s largest source of planet-warming pollution. The rules, which the E.P.A. expects to be final this summer, would require each state to submit a plan detailing how it would cut coal-fired power plant pollution. Once implemented, the plans could lead to the closing of hundreds of coal plants, in what the administration says will be a transformation of the nation\u2019s energy economy away from fossil fuels and toward sources like wind and solar.States that rely heavily on coal production or coal-fired electricity are wary of the plan, which could ultimately freeze demand for coal. Already, 12 states, including Mr. McConnell\u2019s home state, have filed lawsuits opposing the plan and at least a dozen more are expected to file similar suits. But Mr. McConnell urged governors to fight the regulations by simply refusing to submit their state plans to the federal government.\u201cThink twice before submitting a state plan \u2014 which could lock you in to federal enforcement and expose you to lawsuits \u2014 when the administration is standing on shaky legal ground and when, without your support, it won\u2019t be able to demonstrate the capacity to carry out such political extremism,\u201d Mr. McConnell wrote.Since the moment his party regained control of the Senate, Mr. McConnell has made clear that he intends to use all legal, legislative and political means available to fight Mr. Obama\u2019s climate agenda. While Republicans called Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change policies an example of government overreach that could threaten jobs in the coal industry, Mr. McConnell, whose home state is one of the nations\u2019 largest producers and consumers of coal, takes the fight personally. For now, it appears unlikely that Mr. McConnell will be able to use his role as majority leader to completely block the rules. Even if Republicans could summon the majority required to pass legislation that would delay or weaken the rules, Mr. Obama is almost certain to veto such measures. Republicans are unlikely to have the two-thirds majority necessary to override that action. Democrats said that Mr. McConnell\u2019s call for states not to prepare plans appears unprecedented. Under the terms of the Clean Air Act, the executive branch is required to issue the carbon pollution rules. The Supreme Court has upheld that requirement. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented that a leader in the Senate would call on states to disobey the law, which has been upheld many times by the Supreme Court,\u201d said Senator Barbara Boxer of California, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee. \u201cI can\u2019t recall a majority leader calling on states to disobey the law \u2014 and I\u2019ve been here almost 24 years,\u201d she said.Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the E.P.A., said that the agency had been working closely with states to develop their individual plans \u201csince well before we put pen to paper on this rule,\u201d and that she expected to continue to do so. \u201cWe have dialogue with all the states, including the state of Kentucky,\u201d she said.However, Ms. McCarthy\u2019s agency is already preparing a one-size-fits-all compliance plan that would be imposed on states that do not create plans.Jody Freeman, director of Harvard University\u2019s environmental law program and a former senior counselor to President Obama, said that option would be worse for states than simply preparing and submitting their own plans. \u201cIt would put states at a huge disadvantage if they choose not to file a plan,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives E.P.A. the option of implementing their own plan themselves, but the E.P.A. may not have the best plan for each state. States should be designing these plans themselves.\u201dHistorically, states that have refused to submit compliance plans for E.P.A. rules have been forced to follow standards crafted by the department\u2019s officials in Washington. Former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a longtime opponent of the department\u2019s pollution regulations, for instance, refused to submit state-level plans for compliance to other rules. In the end, Texas businesses were eventually forced to comply with the federally imposed plan.The Obama administration is anticipating a protracted legal battle over the rules. In its fiscal year 2016 request to Congress, the E.P.A. asked for $3.5 million to hire 20 new lawyers to defend the new regulations. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Imaginary Health Care Horrors", "Date": "2015-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut that is, of course, how it\u2019s been all along with Obamacare. Before the law went into effect, opponents predicted disaster on all levels. What has happened instead is that the law is working pretty well. So how have the prophets of disaster responded? By pretending that the bad things they said would happen have, in fact, happened.Finally, there\u2019s the never-ending hunt for snarks and boojums \u2014 for ordinary, hard-working Americans who have suffered hardship thanks to health reform. As we\u2019ve just seen, Obamacare opponents by and large don\u2019t do math (and they\u2019re sorry when they try). But all they really need are a few sob stories, tales of sympathetic individuals who have been impoverished by some aspect of the law. In reality, the only people hurt by health reform are Americans with very high incomes, who have seen their taxes go up, and a relatively small number of people who have seen their premiums rise because they\u2019re young and healthy (so insurers previously saw them as good risks) and affluent (so they don\u2019t qualify for subsidies). Neither group supplies suitable victims for attack ads.At a deeper level, however, what we\u2019re looking at here is the impact of post-truth politics. We live in an era in which politicians and the supposed experts who serve them never feel obliged to acknowledge uncomfortable facts, in which no argument is ever dropped, no matter how overwhelming the evidence that it\u2019s wrong. And the result is that imaginary disasters can overshadow real successes. Obamacare isn\u2019t perfect, but it has dramatically improved the lives of millions. Someone should tell the voters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Growth in\u00a0Solar Power Falters as Utilities Balk", "Date": "2015-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMAKURAZAKI, Japan \u2014 Rice fields, golf courses and even a disused airport runway. All over the southern Japanese region of Kyushu, unexpected places gleam with electricity-producing solar panels.Solar use in Japan has exploded over the last two years as part of an ambitious national effort to promote renewable energy. But the technology\u2019s future role is now in doubt.Utilities say their infrastructure cannot handle the swelling army of solar entrepreneurs intent on selling their power. And their willingness to invest more money depends heavily on whether the government remains committed to clean energy.\u201cIt\u2019s upsetting,\u201d said Junji Akagi, a real estate developer on Ukujima, a tiny island near Nagasaki. Mr. Akagi said he hoped to turn a quarter of the island\u2019s 10-square-mile area into a \u201cmega-solar\u201d generating station, and has already lined up investors and secured the necessary land.Then last September, Kyushu Electric Power Company, the region\u2019s dominant utility, abruptly announced that it would stop contracting to buy electricity from new solar installations. Other power companies elsewhere in Japan soon followed suit.\u201cIt was a shock,\u201d Mr. Akagi said. \u201cNow we don\u2019t know if Kyushu Electric will buy our power.\u201dThe faltering solar boom is threatening an important goal for Japan as a whole: finding clean sources of power to replace the nuclear output lost after the Fukushima disaster four years ago. So far, the country has been relying mostly on fossil fuels like coal and natural gas to fill the gap, leading to sharply higher emissions of greenhouse gases.Mr. Abe has initiated a review of the renewable-energy policies introduced after Fukushima by a previous, more left-leaning administration. Environmentalists worry he will gut them. The government recently reduced the amount of clean power that utilities are required to buy from outside producers, and additional measures to curb supply are expected this spring, including cuts to price subsidies.\u201cIt would put a brake on the spread of solar power,\u201d Yuji Kuroiwa, the ecologically minded governor of Kanagawa Prefecture, next to Tokyo, said at a news conference in December, referring to the new restrictions.Like other countries that have promoted the technology with generous state support, Japan is also struggling with the financial and technical consequences of its rapid solar growth. Solar power here is costly for consumers because of high state-mandated prices, and handling the fluctuating output of thousands of mostly small solar producers is tricky for utilities. Necessary improvements in the infrastructure have not kept pace, experts say.\u201cThe homework wasn\u2019t done,\u201d said Nobuo Tanaka, former executive director of the International Energy Agency. Utilities, he said, need to install more hardware \u2014 transmission cables, substations and the like \u2014 and develop new kinds of expertise to avoid disruptions. \u201cTo make renewables work in reality, they have to be properly connected to the power system.\u201dThe problem is especially acute in Kyushu, where relatively plentiful sunshine and low land prices have attracted a disproportionate share of solar development.Installed solar capacity roughly doubled in the two years from mid-2012, when a law took effect requiring utilities to buy renewable energy from outside producers at rates far above market prices. By last summer it stood at 3.4 gigawatts, about equal to the output of three modern nuclear reactors \u2014 at least during those hours when the sun was shining at full strength.More challenging for electric-company planners is what is in the pipeline. An additional 8.4 gigawatts\u2019 worth of projects, including Mr. Akagi\u2019s on Ukujima, have received government approval but are in limbo after Kyushu Electric\u2019s edict. That is more power than the region consumes on some low-demand days \u2014 and far too much for Kyushu Electric\u2019s grid to handle without the risk of failures, the utility argues.\u201cIf we accept everybody\u2019s electricity, the system will become unmanageable,\u201d said Shinichi Futami, an official at the utility. It is laying new transmission cables as fast as it can, he added, but has been stymied by the slow, expensive task of securing land rights.Solar projects have already changed the landscape and economy in Kyushu. They have taken over reservoirs, bankrupt golf courses and idle industrial parks, as well as the more familiar locations of residential rooftops.The largest ones, like the Nanatsushima Mega-Solar Power Plant in Kagoshima, which opened in 2013, cover areas bigger than 100 football fields. Its vast lot was set aside for a shipyard more than 30 years ago, but sat empty until the recent solar boom.In Makurazaki, a remote city in Kagoshima, the local airport went unused for a decade, a victim of economic and population decline. Now its 4,200-foot runway is covered end to end with solar panels, a project under the co-ownership of a leasing company and a subsidiary of Kyushu Electric.The facility is expected to power 2,500 homes this year, its first full year of operation. And instead of paying to maintain an empty airport, Makurazaki will receive about 85 million yen, or a little over $700,000, in annual revenues, mainly from leasing the land.\u201cThe airport was a burden, but now we\u2019re getting something for it,\u201d said Tadashi Kamizono, the city\u2019s mayor.For all the frantic building, however, Japan still produces less solar power than many other countries. Nationwide, just 2.2 percent of its electricity came from any renewable source in the last fiscal year, excluding hydropower from dams. The small percentage is the legacy of a narrow focus on nuclear power before Fukushima. The figure was less than half the level of the United States or France, and a fraction of the roughly 20 percent achieved by Germany and Spain.Catching up would be expensive, even if all the necessary infrastructure existed. Japan\u2019s financial incentives for solar power and other renewables are the highest in the world \u2014 about twice the level of Germany, depending on the type of installation.According to the government, if every solar plant now on the drawing board were actually to be built, it would cost users \u00a52.7 trillion a year in special charges, or about $23 billion, four times the premium they\u2019re paying now.Higher energy bills related to the nuclear shutdown are already being blamed for squeezing household budgets. That is hurting consumer spending and undercutting Mr. Abe\u2019s efforts to jolt the economy to life, through his stimulus program known as Abenomics.Rather than curtail the expansion of solar power, advocates for the technology say a broader shake-up of Japan\u2019s electricity market is needed. Utilities like Kyushu Electric, they argue, have little incentive to accommodate outside competitors to their own coal, gas and nuclear plants. Instead of seeking innovative solutions to the oversupply problem, utilities are using it as an excuse for inaction, said Tomas Kaberger, a Swedish energy expert who heads the Japan Renewable Energy Foundation.\u201cI presume that it\u2019s to protect their economic interests,\u201d he said, \u201cnot their technological interests or the interests of their customers.\u201dA bill now in Parliament is intended to promote competition. It would force Japan\u2019s 10 regional utilities to split their generation and transmission operations into legally separate businesses. The two sides would remain closely connected, however, and some say the plan does not go far enough to even the playing field for new entrants, including those in green energy.\u201cThese 10 monopolies will still own the grid,\u201d said Tom O\u2019Sullivan, a Tokyo-based energy consultant. \u201cIt will still be very difficult for independent power companies to get their electricity into the grid.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about the growth of solar energy production in Japan misspelled the name of an island near Nagasaki on which a real estate developer hopes to build a solar power plant. It is Ukujima, not Ukushima.Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Faces Test of Record as Women\u2019s Advocate", "Date": "2015-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 It was supposed to be a carefully planned anniversary to mark one of the most important and widely praised moments in Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s political career \u2014 and to remind the country, ahead of a likely 2016 presidential campaign, about her long record as a champion for the rights of women and girls.Instead, as Mrs. Clinton commemorates her 1995 women\u2019s rights speech in Beijing in back-to-back events in New York, she finds herself under attack for her family foundation\u2019s acceptance of millions of dollars in donations from Middle Eastern countries known for violence against women and for denying them many basic freedoms.This was not how she intended to reintroduce herself to American voters.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s glide path to a likely April announcement that she will seek the presidency was built around women\u2019s issues. Advancing women has been her central life\u2019s work, as she and her admirers say proudly; she made it a priority as secretary of state and focused on it as a philanthropist. But that focus also allowed Mrs. Clinton, who played down her gender in 2008, to frame her second attempt at the White House in what could be one way to make it special and new: as a shot at history for her and for all women.And for someone who has so long been lampooned, and demonized on the right, as overly calculating, playing up her gender as a strength would also allow her to demonstrate her nurturing, maternal \u2014 and newly grandmotherly \u2014 side to voters whom she may have left cold in the past.Even her most strident critics could not have predicted that Mrs. Clinton would prove vulnerable on the subject.But the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation has accepted tens of millions of dollars in donations from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Algeria and Brunei \u2014 all of which the State Department has faulted over their records on sex discrimination and other human-rights issues.Saudi Arabia has been a particularly generous benefactor to the Clinton Foundation, giving at least $10 million since 2001, according to foundation disclosures. At least $1 million more was donated by Friends of Saudi Arabia, co-founded by a Saudi prince.On Saturday, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s husband, the former president, felt compelled to defend the foundation\u2019s fund-raising. At an event at the University of Miami, where Mrs. Clinton and the couple\u2019s daughter, Chelsea, discussed \u201cNo Ceilings,\u201d the foundation\u2019s project measuring the advancement of women and girls, he defended the charity\u2019s acceptance of foreign donations, pointing to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in particular.\u201cDo we agree with everything they do? No,\u201d Mr. Clinton said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country,\u201d he added.The \u201cNo Ceilings\u201d report, to be unveiled Monday, finds that \u201cthere has never been a better time to be born female,\u201d but catalogs a host of problems and obstacles \u2014 legal, economic and social \u2014 that persist. One section has particular resonance for Mrs. Clinton: \u201cAlmost twice as many women hold political office today compared to 20 years ago, but they still are very much a minority,\u201d the report says, adding that \u201cthe pace of change in women\u2019s leadership has been far too slow.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of unfinished business,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said Saturday of the report\u2019s findings. A foundation official said no foreign governments had contributed to the \u201cNo Ceilings\u201d effort. \u201cAnyone that supports the Clinton Foundation does so knowing we work to empower girls and women around the world,\u201d said Maura Pally, its acting chief executive.That correspondence, if it exists, would most likely have taken place on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private email address, putting its accessibility \u2014 to journalists, scholars or political adversaries \u2014 in doubt. Already, Citizens United, a conservative advocacy group, has made 16 appeals under the Freedom of Information Act for State Department correspondence mostly related to Mrs. Clinton and foundation donors.The donations from countries with poor records on women\u2019s rights, however, presented a difficult appearance problem for a candidate running in part as the embodiment of women\u2019s aspirations to equality.\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of the conflict of interest here,\u201d said Richard W. Painter, a White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush.\u201cThe United States has at least two issues that are very important with Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is continuing to fight terrorism, and the second is the rights of women.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s ramp-up to a candidacy built around women\u2019s issues continues in New York on Monday, when she and the philanthropist Melinda Gates unveil the \u201cNo Ceilings\u201d report. The next day, Mrs. Clinton will be the keynote speaker at a United Nations gathering on women\u2019s empowerment.Both events explicitly invoke Mrs. Clinton\u2019s forceful speech in Beijing as first lady in 1995, at the Fourth World Conference on Women, when she gave a devastating litany of abuse afflicting women around the world and declared: \u201cHuman rights are women\u2019s rights, and women\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201dThe Beijing speech has been a touchstone for Mrs. Clinton since she stepped down as secretary of state in early 2013. But the more she recalls it, the more Republicans seek to diminish it. \u201cShe made one statement in Beijing that wasn\u2019t very profound \u2014 that women are human beings,\u201d said Bruce Fein, a lawyer and supporter of Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.At the State Department, Mrs. Clinton emphasized how empowering women and girls could also enhance economies, national security and the overall progress of a country. She appointed a close aide, Melanne Verveer, as the first United States ambassador at large for global women\u2019s issues.Some of that work was behind the scenes, however. In her memoir, \u201cHard Choices,\u201d Mrs. Clinton tells of quietly intervening when Saudi Arabian courts refused a mother\u2019s pleas to block the marriage of her 8-year-old daughter to a 50-year-old man. \u201cFix this on your own, and I won\u2019t say a word,\u201d she recalled telling the Saudis. A new judge, she wrote, quickly approved the divorce.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Likely Next Steps", "Date": "2015-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ&AThe latest polls I\u2019ve seen still show that a majority of Israeli Jews support a two-state solution. But an even larger majority of them doubt it can happen, either because of the regional situation or because of the Palestinian leadership or some combination of these and other reasons.One right-wing vision, as articulated by the Jewish Home party, is for Israel to annex the two-thirds of the West Bank where its settlers live, and offer the Palestinians living there Israeli citizenship. The major Palestinian cities like Ramallah, Bethlehem and Jenin would have autonomy without statehood; Israeli security forces would remain deployed around them.There is some deeper thinking about how a binational state might actually function \u2014 or not. Some suggest a single government entity for foreign policy and defense, but parallel bureaucracies for schools, courts and other services for Israeli and Palestinian citizens, regardless of where they live. I\u2019m not sure where trash pickup fits in this model.One-staters have said to me: \u201cIsrael is amoral; apartheid fell. The Soviet Union fell. Ethnocracies do not have a place in the 21st century.\u201d But Israel was created as a Jewish state. The vast majority of Israelis want to live in a Jewish state, however they define that. And I\u2019m not sure the one-state vision really fulfills Palestinian national aspirations, either.I suppose Mr. Netanyahu would say, long term, he still supports the creation of a demilitarized Palestine that recognizes Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people. But he thinks that is impossible right now. So, what about in the meantime?Mr. Netanyahu in the past talked about economic peace \u2014 increased cooperation on tourism, development initiatives and other business \u2014 which the Palestinians generally rebuffed as off point. Some leaders among the Israeli settlers and the Jewish Home party talk about managing the conflict instead of solving it, and improving people\u2019s lives across the West Bank by removing checkpoints and increasing work opportunities.Since last summer\u2019s war between Israel and Hamas, there has been some relaxation of restrictions on the Gaza Strip to allow a few more businesspeople to cross in and out, and some vegetable exports. Supposedly, in a few weeks or months we might see thousands of Gazans regain permits to work in Israel. But this is really on the margins.Remember, too, Israel is still an adolescent nation. Sometimes I think about what it must have been like to cover America in the 1840s \u2014 how far out were our leaders back then planning?He is much less likely to recall Israel\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Ron Dermer, anytime soon. On Friday night, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s spokesman issued a statement reiterating how proud the prime minister is of Mr. Dermer.I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a formal freeze of settlement construction, either, but I think the new government may slow down construction in the isolated settlements beyond the blocs Israelis expect to stay theirs, as the pro-settler Jewish Home party will have less influence than it did before the election.On the eve of the recent Israeli election, the prime minister said that no Palestinian state would be created on his watch. Two days later, he began to backtrack.A couple of years ago it really seemed like the prime minister wanted the United States to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, or at least support an Israeli attack on them. I think he realizes now the first is not going to happen, and many people think the second one is also unimaginable in the foreseeable future.The Israeli leader\u2019s settlement policy resembles his predecessors\u2019, but it is a march toward permanence at a time when prospects for peace are few.A lot of Israelis think the Iranians will ultimately reject the Western powers\u2019 best offer.Mr. Netanyahu is not na\u00efve about the importance of Israel\u2019s allies, especially the United States, though many people think he does not demonstrate that well. I was struck at the start of last summer\u2019s war with Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip by how much diplomatic work he did to make Israel\u2019s case in hopes of preventing the kind of international condemnations for civilian casualties that there had been in previous conflicts. It worked, to some extent: World leaders generally coupled any criticism of Israeli attacks in the early days and weeks of the conflict with harsh words about Hamas\u2019s rocket fire and militant activity from civilian neighborhoods.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud party achieved a surprisingly strong victory in Tuesday\u2019s election. Now, he is likely to build a right-wing coalition of 67 of the 120 members of the Knesset, Israel\u2019s Parliament.As I mentioned above, there has already been a slight relaxation of restrictions, including the first export of tomatoes, eggplants and other produce since Hamas took over Gaza, and import of construction materials to start rebuilding thousands of damaged and destroyed homes. If Israel really allows 5,000 Gaza residents to work in Israel, that would be a significant change, affecting both the Gaza economy and perhaps, more important, its psychology.But Mr. Lieberman\u2019s role in the next government will likely be smaller than the last, as he has lost seats, given up his official partnership with Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud, and been unabashedly critical of the prime minister. The ultra-Orthodox factions will likely demand an unraveling of legislation passed by the last government to reduce the widespread draft exemptions for men who study the Torah full time and push for more subsidies for large, religious families.

{"Headline": "Fragile Cease-Fire in Ukraine Inspires Little Confidence in West", "Date": "2015-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisBRUSSELS \u2014 No one really expects Ukraine to get better before it gets worse, or for the promises contained in last month\u2019s cease-fire agreement to be kept.The West, which seems united, is actually divided over Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine and what to do about them.Those disagreements were clear this month at the annual Brussels Forum of the German Marshall Fund, which brings together top officials from the United States and Europe.How Russia aims to achieve its goal of keeping Ukraine isolated from the West.European nations \u2014 led by Germany and France, which negotiated with Mr. Putin and Mr. Poroshenko in Minsk \u2014 oppose giving Kiev even defensive arms, arguing that it would inflame the situation and provide justification for Russian escalation.But Washington is not convinced. Nor is NATO\u2019s supreme commander, Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, who said the West must respond to Russia\u2019s active supply of advanced weapons and troops to the rebels, which is undermining confidence in European security. \u201cWe, I think, in the West should consider all our tools in reply,\u201d he said. \u201cCould it be destabilizing? The answer is yes. Also, inaction could be destabilizing. Is inaction an appropriate action?\u201dGeneral Breedlove\u2019s outspokenness and willingness to publicize photographs of continuing Russian intervention in Ukraine have not endeared him to German officials or to some in Washington, who do not want to be pushed into making difficult decisions.Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs, said the Russian-supported separatists possessed far better and more sophisticated military equipment than the Ukrainian Army. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen, month on month, more lethal weaponry of a higher caliber\u201d from \u201cseparatist Russian allies\u201d entering Ukraine, she said. \u201cThe No. 1 thing is for Russia to stop sending arms over the border so we can have real politics.\u201dRussia faces large loan payments by year\u2019s end that amount to a third of its foreign-currency reserves, making some officials wonder whether it will escalate or try to accommodate, hoping to get the European sanctions lifted.Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former American national security adviser, expressed pessimism. Predicting the placement of Russian nuclear weapons in Crimea, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that, at this stage, we have succeeded in convincing the Russians that we are prepared to deter the kind of steps they are adopting.\u201dMr. Brzezinski said he wanted to balance deterrence and accommodation, but suggested that \u201cthe Russians may pursue an assertive policy towards Ukraine just far enough to avoid a military confrontation but produce the result of the total collapse of the Ukrainian economy, the wasting of billions of dollars that came from the West.\u201d Despite the sanctions, he said, Russia \u201cremains a major power and therefore achieves a major change in the geopolitical situation in Europe.\u201dA news analysis article on Sunday about divisions among Western nations over how to respond to Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine referred incorrectly to large Russian loan payments due by year\u2019s end, which some analysts say could make Russia more willing to cooperate to get European sanctions lifted. The payments amount to a third of Russia\u2019s foreign-currency reserves; they do not exceed the reserves.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone Prices Continue to Fall, Fueling Concerns", "Date": "2015-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Prices fell in February in Europe for the third straight month, adding to worries about possible deflation. The jobless rate, though, declined to its lowest since 2012, providing a welcome glimmer of hope that the economy might be picking up steam.Although the inflation and unemployment numbers were marginally stronger than economists had expected, the market reaction was muted. The euro, which has been trading near its lowest levels since 2003, closed the European day down 0.1 percent at $1.1187, while the Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone blue chips closed 0.2 percent lower.Under the central bank\u2019s new policy, known as quantitative easing, it is expected this month to begin buying up to 60 billion euros, or about $67 billion, of bonds \u2014 including sovereign debt \u2014 on the open market.Energy prices fell 7.9 percent in February from a year earlier, Eurostat said. The downturn in oil prices, which began falling sharply in the second half of 2014, has contributed to the deflationary pressures on Europe.Many economists see lower energy prices as an unalloyed good for the economy, since they put more discretionary income into consumers\u2019 pockets. But oil prices are only part of the story, as inflation has undershot the European Central Bank\u2019s target rate of just under 2 percent since early 2013.The so-called core inflation rate, which strips out energy and food prices, rose 0.6 percent in February.\u201cIt\u2019s like a tax cut,\u201d Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at Nomura in London, said of lower oil prices. While the impact is positive, he said, the benefit is likely to last only a few months before fading.Mr. Cailloux said the small decline in the jobless rate suggested lower energy prices were helping to lift growth in the eurozone\u2019s gross domestic product to slightly above the 1.1 percent he has been predicting for 2015. But he still expects the region to remain in \u201ca slow-growth, low-inflation environment\u201d for some time to come.The best hope, he said, was that the positive impact of the lower oil price would feed back more broadly throughout the economy, creating a sustained surge in growth. But, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing for now.\u201dFalling prices in the eurozone also reflect the slack in the labor market. Inflationary pressures are modestly stronger in Germany, where the jobless rate was just 4.7 percent, than in Spain and Greece, where a quarter or more of the work force is unemployed and where prices are contracting.An earlier version of this article misstated the last year the euro was trading near its current low levels. It was 2003, not 2013.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Developer Evergrande Gets $16 Billion Lifeline Amid Slump", "Date": "2015-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese banks have extended $16 billion in credit lines to shore up one of the country\u2019s largest and most heavily indebted home builders, as pressure mounts on developers short of cash in a slumping property market.The move by a group of mainly state-run banks to bolster the builder, Evergrande Real Estate Group, which is controlled by the billionaire Hui Ka Yan, is the latest sign of tumult in China\u2019s sprawling housing sector.Evergrande said on Tuesday that since February, it had secured new credit lines totaling 100 billion renminbi, or $16.2 billion. Those included a new 30 billion renminbi commitment on Monday from the Bank of China, which regards the developer as \u201cits most important bankwide long-term partner,\u201d Evergrande said in a news release.Evergrande is one of China\u2019s biggest developers, with sales last year of more than 130 billion renminbi. But it is also one of the most indebted, borrowing heavily from foreign investors in the United States dollar offshore market \u2014 debts that become more expensive to repay as the renminbi weakens.Analysts said the support from the banks \u2014 which also include the Agricultural Bank of China, Postal Savings Bank of China and the privately controlled China Minsheng Bank \u2014 would provide temporary relief but would fall short of addressing the company\u2019s deeper problems.Mounting debts and slumping sales \u201care fundamental challenges that can\u2019t be resolved short term by government\u2019s bailing them out on \u2018too big to fail\u2019 pretense,\u201d said Junheng Li, the head of research at JL Warren Capital in New York.\u201cThe company has been under financial distress for a long time,\u201d she added.A spokesman for Evergrande did not return phone calls or emails seeking comment on Tuesday.The Chinese leadership is concerned about the health of the country\u2019s property market because it is so deeply interconnected with other parts of the economy. Real estate is an important driver of steel consumption, loan growth and jobs for sales agents and migrant construction workers. A drop in home prices hurts ordinary Chinese because they tend to invest a disproportionate amount of their savings in real estate.On Wednesday, China published monthly property market figures showing that prices fell in February in 66 of the 70 cities surveyed when compared with a year earlier. Data released last week showed that new housing starts, measured by floor space, fell 20 percent in the first two months of the year compared with a year earlier, while new land purchases by developers fell 32 percent.\u201cThe market is still undergoing a pretty rough time, and what that means for developers is that the operating environment will remain tough,\u201d Franco Leung, a vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service in Hong Kong, said on Tuesday in a phone interview.Mr. Leung said that Evergrande\u2019s new credit lines would help give it another source of liquidity but that the company was already heavily indebted. \u201cWe are monitoring their level of debt buildup quite closely,\u201d he said.Evergrande had total borrowings of 151.8 billion renminbi at the end of June, the most recent figure available. But that number did not include an additional 44.5 billion renminbi worth of perpetual bonds, so called because they have no fixed repayment date, which the company carries on its books as equity.Evergrande was founded in 1996 by Mr. Hui, now its chairman and majority shareholder, who also goes by Xu Jiayin. The company started as a builder of middle-class homes outside prime neighborhoods, with projects in and around its home city of Guangzhou, in southern China, before expanding nationally to more than 100 cities.Evergrande acquired the villa \u201cvia a string of shell companies,\u201d in Australia, Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands, Mr. Hockey said. The purchase was illegal because foreign investors are required to notify the treasurer before purchasing real estate. They can build new homes but are barred from buying existing ones.\u201cWe welcome all foreign investment that is not contrary to our national interest,\u201d Mr. Hockey said in a March 3 news release. Evergrande has 90 days to find a buyer for the property.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quirky $200 Million Art Venture Proves Just the Ticket for Tasmania", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHobart JournalHOBART, Australia \u2014 For most of its existence, Tasmania was known as a faraway island at the bottom of Australia, a grim 19th-century redoubt where British colonial officers imprisoned convicts in the harshest of the empire\u2019s jails and killed much of the aboriginal population.So perhaps it was not entirely surprising when a wealthy local gambler and mathematician opened a lavish art museum here three years ago and announced with a flourish that it would be devoted to the themes of sex and death. The venture, housed in an underground labyrinth of sandstone and located on a spit of land upriver from this sleepy harborside city, conjured more darkness.But then its owner and creator, David Walsh, slightly amended his original premise, opting instead for an idiosyncratic, $200 million museum that blends top international contemporary art with well-stocked bars and lounge areas. To the shock of Tasmania\u2019s patricians, some of whom can trace their lineage to the early settlers, and to the surprise of most of the island\u2019s 500,000 largely working-class residents, the Museum of Old and New Art has been a huge success.More than a million people have visited the hard-to-reach showplace. Lonely Planet catapulted Tasmania into the Top 10 of the world\u2019s must-see places this year. Curators from New York and Paris have marveled at how the museum flouts convention: There are no explanatory placards fixed to the walls, and visitors are encouraged to wander through the subterranean spaces at will.They can stop at the \u201cFat Car,\u201d a glistening red Porsche plumped with fiberglass into a bulbous symbol of conspicuous consumption by the Austrian sculptor Erwin Wurm. They can admire the large installation of sheaves of gray steel by the German artist Anselm Kiefer, housed in its own building. They can squirm at the \u201cCloaca Professional\u201d by the Belgian artist Wim Delvoye, who devised six machines suspended from the ceiling that every day duplicate human defecation, and its smells.\u201cThe museum is born of risk, just like David\u2019s early life of gambling,\u201d said Leigh Carmichael, a close collaborator of Mr. Walsh\u2019s and the creative director of the museum\u2019s winter festival. \u201cHe stripped down the old museum of white spaces and interpretation and created immersive material so that you don\u2019t feel guilty if you are not learning something.\u201dFor many, the first glimmer of the museum \u2014 colloquially referred to by its friendly-sounding acronym, MONA \u2014 is a high-powered catamaran that glides from the city\u2019s port down the Derwent River to the museum entrance. On the way, three bars serve Champagne, wine and beer (one is called the Posh Pit) accompanied by delectable pies and pastries prepared by onboard chefs. The catamaran, painted in camouflage to signal that it is protecting the once-polluted river, offers a baroque-style comfy sofa for relaxation on the lower back deck and stools shaped like sheep in the outdoor upper saloon.At the museum\u2019s dock, visitors clamber up 99 steps as if going to a temple. At the top, however, they are confronted with a well-kept, hard-surface tennis court; Mr. Walsh lives on the site and likes to play, guides explain. He also likes omelets. Hence, chickens roam the grounds. And he enjoys wine, so there is a small vineyard, too, making the museum a kind of personal pleasure palace that its creator shares with many others.A mirrored outdoor wall surrounds the entrance. Inside, smiling guides hand out iPod-like devices, called O machines, that use location detection technology devised by an Australian company to tell visitors what artworks they are looking at.A visitor can roam three levels of dimly lit rooms displaying art (definitely no white walls) and along a corridor of sandstone carved 60 feet below ground. Victorian armchairs line a wall opposite the bare rock, an area called the Void Bar where on a recent day people sat chatting, drinking Champagne and checking their cellphones.On the sprawling grounds an austere marble and steel gazebo by the American artist James Turrell serves as a place of contemplation. Nearby, a concrete mixer fabricated by Mr. Delvoye from intricately patterned laser-cut steel looks like the ultimate boy\u2019s toy.In all, about 200 of Mr. Walsh\u2019s collection of 1,500 artworks are on display, said Delia Nicholls, the museum\u2019s research curator. Not on show at the moment: \u201cThe Holy Virgin Mary\u201d by Chris Ofili, the painting of a black Madonna that incorporated elephant dung and created a political furor when it was shown at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1999. Mr. Walsh acquired it some years ago from the Saatchi Gallery in London.The museum attracts all kinds \u2014 traditional art lovers, young art students, tourists who have come to Tasmania for the island\u2019s natural beauty. Yet, even with the tourism the museum has generated for the struggling Tasmanian economy, Mr. Walsh, 53, is a figure local residents cannot quite embrace.He grew up in a poor family not far from where MONA now stands. His father trained greyhounds. He talks in an autobiography of loathing school and hiding in the 19th-century Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery so that he could read what he wanted.The University of Tasmania, where he studied as an undergraduate, was close to a casino, where Mr. Walsh applied his aptitude for mathematics to high-stakes gambling. He formed a syndicate, Bank Roll, and traveled the world winning big.In the first catalog for MONA, he explained his motivation for the museum: \u201cI invent a gambling system. Make a money mine. Turns out it ain\u2019t so great getting rich ... What to do? Better build a museum; make myself famous. That will get the chicks.\u201dBeneath the bravura, he says he has long been interested in why humankind has always made art. He suspects, he says, that the drive is biologically based, an evolutionary adaptation.\u201cSo the question becomes, \u2018How does art help us to survive?,\u2019\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThis seems to me the most important art question available (except possibly, \u2018What is art?\u2019). There are probably a number of correct answers, since evolution is opportunistic,\u201d he wrote.To explore the question of art and evolution, Mr. Walsh has invited two American experts in evolutionary psychology, Steven Pinker and Geoffrey Miller, and the cognitive scientist and neurobiologist Mark Changizi, who have all visited the museum, to curate exhibits at MONA in 2016.\u201cI am opportunistic also, and I will grab any opportunity to ask a good question while putting some great pictures on the wall,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Co-op Maintenance Reduced to Almost Nothing", "Date": "2015-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor one West Village co-op, at least, it\u2019s been a kind winter.In January, residents of 99 Bank Street, a brick and cast-iron complex at Hudson Street, learned that their maintenance bills were being slashed to almost nothing.Capitalizing on a strong retail leasing market, the co-op has rented out storefronts in the building to a grocery store and a restaurant, whose rents are expected to cover most of the cost of things like doormen\u2019s salaries, property taxes and heat.There\u2019s no guarantee that this nearly free ride will last, of course. Stores in New York turn over all the time. But the move, which continues a recent trend in some Manhattan neighborhoods, seems to defy a law of real estate physics, since maintenance fees usually rise, not fall. Co-ops lucky enough to have prime retail space in their buildings have been able to take advantage of record high retail rents and trim maintenance bills for shareholders, thanks to a recent easing of co-op tax laws.\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Ben Cohen, a resident of 99 Bank whose 520-square-foot studio now has a maintenance fee of $20.40 a month, or about a dime per share. Previously, it was $816 a month. A special assessment of about $170 a month has vanished as well. \u201cLearning that my maintenance would be half of my electric bill was astounding,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.There are two major retail berths at the co-op, an 1890 former industrial building that occupies a full block bounded by Bank, Hudson, Greenwich and Bethune Streets. One has been leased to Mrs. Green\u2019s Natural Market, a grocery store that will open this summer. The other space will be occupied by the Missing Ingredient, a restaurant focusing on gluten-free dishes that is set to open by April.But as any landlord who installed a RadioShack or a Blockbuster video store may know, even seemingly invincible national brands can run into trouble. In fact, the building\u2019s last restaurant tenant, the Marrow, with German and Italian cuisine, shuttered last fall after about two years.The co-op board at 99 Bank seems to recognize that any subsidy could be fleeting. According to a letter sent by the board to residents on Jan. 7, rents from the Missing Ingredient and Mrs. Green\u2019s are expected to \u201cpay the bulk of your maintenance.\u201d But, the letter continued, \u201cthe amount of the maintenance reduction will depend upon the continued rental income and may also reflect other budgetary needs of the co-op such as capital improvements.\u201dBut the new retail tenants believe that shareholders should be reaping savings for years to come. Frank Baldassare, an owner of the Missing Ingredient, which has a 10-year lease for a two-level, 3,200-square-foot space, with an option to stay on for five more years, said the board reviewed his financial records before signing a lease last fall. The deal was fairly straightforward, said Mr. Baldassare, a wellness entrepreneur who has worked for other New York restaurants.About the only unusual stipulation was that the restaurant close at 1 a.m. on weekends and at midnight on weekdays, he said. \u201cThey seem to want it to succeed, which is good news,\u201d Mr. Baldassare said, adding, \u201cin this day and age, considering what\u2019s happening with real estate in Manhattan, I would be thrilled to live there.\u201dThe building, which in the mid-20th century contained showrooms for General Electric products like radios before converting to a co-op in 1980, has played host to retail businesses for some time. Besides the Marrow, restaurants through the decades have included K.O.\u2019s, Nadine\u2019s and Paris Commune, which relocated from nearby Bleecker Street.The commercial space where Mrs. Green\u2019s is going, and which has the address of 585 Hudson Street, contained a Duane Reade pharmacy that was open for more than a decade before closing in 2013, residents said. A Duane Reade spokesman did not return phone calls for comment.But retail rents have escalated so rapidly in this upscale corner of the Village that 99 Bank\u2019s commercial space was being drastically underutilized, said real estate agents familiar with the building. And revenues were not keeping pace with the rise in building costs, like insurance and property taxes, they added.In the effort to change its retail tenants, the co-op board at 99 Bank, which is in a historic district, also wanted something other than a chain pharmacy, agents said.Mrs. Green\u2019s, which is based in Westchester County, does have other locations around the country. But its list of products includes healthy, socially conscious fare like hormone- and antibiotic-free beef, and so is more closely aligned with the co-op\u2019s values, said Robin Abrams, a commercial agent involved with the deal.\u201cThey liked that the tenant was all about organic and natural foods, more of a lifestyle type of retailer,\u201d said Ms. Abrams, a principal of the Lansco Corporation. \u201cThey also thought this would be something that the neighborhood sorely needed.\u201dMrs. Green\u2019s, which signed a lease in September 2013 for a nearly 15,000-square-foot two-level space at 99 Bank, is expected to open this summer, according to John Collins, a company spokesman.Other co-ops may have an incentive to replace stores as their leases run out, with maintenance fees at Manhattan co-ops now averaging more than $2,000 a month, according to a recent search of listings on StreetEasy.com.Other co-ops reaping rewards from their storefronts include 451 Broome Street, a 12-story blocklong co-op in SoHo that has two apparel retailers: James Perse, on the Mercer Street side, and the U.S. Polo Assn., on Broadway. Robert Earl, a principal broker of the InHouse Group, a brokerage, is listing a four-bedroom there at $3.95 million, with a monthly maintenance fee of zero. Also, the current owner of that unit got back about $5,000 at the end of last year from leftover funds, Mr. Earl said.Even neighborhoods not associated with high-end shopping districts seem to be benefiting. At 184 East Seventh Street, a co-op at the corner of Avenue B in the East Village, a pair of commercial tenants \u2014 an architecture firm and a jewelry store \u2014 helps keep maintenance to $1.32 a share, or a low $252 a month for a one-bedroom recently listed at $539,000.And while the recession kept some co-ops from fully taking advantage of the change in rules, Mr. Shmulewitz said, many co-ops are exploring their options anew. \u201cThe effects are just beginning to percolate,\u201d he said. Besides, he added, some buildings have had to wait years for existing retail leases to expire.Another option being explored by some co-ops is to sell a master lease for their storefronts to third parties, which then lease the space on behalf of the co-op and protect it from the risk of a business failing and not being able to pay its rent, analysts said. This master-lease option also is advantageous for buildings that prefer a large cash infusion up front, rather than a slow trickle of rents over time.On the other hand, co-ops leasing to stores directly can protect themselves by demanding huge security deposits up front, creating a cushion in case the economy turns, real estate agents said.At 99 Bank, shareholders likely won\u2019t get rich from the new revenue. In fact, they are required to pay taxes on any income the co-op receives that is used to discount maintenance, according to the January board letter. And, if they move, they must transfer their stake in a newly formed limited liability company that actually leases the commercial spaces to whoever takes over the apartment.But the value of their real estate seemed to have jumped overnight. Apartment 5S, a studio that came on the market before the maintenance was reduced, was initially listed at $725,000. But demand, based on the news about the lower maintenance, led to several offers, including at least one above the asking price, so the unit is now expected to close in March for $770,000, said Katherine Salyi, the saleswoman with Nest Seekers International who listed it. Its monthly maintenance was reduced to about $20, she said, from $808.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Federal Rules Are Set for Fracking", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fracking boom has put the United States on track to soon become the world\u2019s largest oil and gas producer. But environmentalists fear that the technique, which involves injecting a cocktail of chemicals deep underground to break up the rocks around oil and gas deposits, could contaminate surrounding water supplies and wildlife.As the practice of fracking has soared, fights over how and whether to regulate it have broken out across the country. The states have jurisdiction over drilling on private and state-owned land, where the vast majority of fracking is done in the United States. The new federal rules, by contrast, will cover about 100,000 oil and gas wells drilled on public lands, according to the Interior Department.Still, Obama administration officials hope that the federal rules will serve as a de facto standard for state legislatures grappling with their own regulations.\u201cCurrent federal well-drilling regulations are more than 30 years old, and they simply have not kept pace with the technical complexities of today\u2019s hydraulic fracturing operations,\u201d said the interior secretary, Sally Jewell.Ms. Jewell, who oversaw the creation of the rules, noted that while they would create standards only for wells drilled on public lands, \u201cthere are a number of states where these may be the only regulations they have.\u201d The onus for creating further rules, she said, \u201cmust now be taken up in statehouses and boardrooms across the country.\u201dThe regulations, which are to take effect in 90 days, will allow government workers to inspect and validate the safety and integrity of the concrete barriers that line fracking wells. They will require companies to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the fracturing process within 30 days of completing fracking operations, using an industry-run website called FracFocus.Environmentalists take issue with the decision to rely on a site created by and for the fracking industry.The rules will also set safety standards for how companies can store used fracking chemicals around well sites, and will require companies to submit detailed information on well geology to the Bureau of Land Management, a part of the Interior Department.Oil and gas companies have resisted fracking regulations, fearing that they could raise the cost of fracking and slow or freeze energy development.\u201cThese new federal mandates will add burdensome new costs on our independent producers,\u201d Mr. Russell said.Interior Department officials noted that in states that regulate fracking, companies are already complying with similar regulations. It estimated the new regulations would add about $5,500 to the cost of fracking each individual well \u2014 which it calculates as less than 1 percent of the total cost of drilling.The agency also noted that it spent four years developing the rules, in close consultation with oil and gas companies, state authorities and environmental groups. It has reviewed more than 1.5 million public comments.Environmental groups offered only lukewarm praise of the regulations, which they said included too many concessions to industry groups.\u201cThis is an important step forward in regulating fracking, a process which has concerned communities across the country,\u201d said Madeleine Foote, legislative representative for the League of Conservation Voters.\u201cMany aspects of this rule, such as stricter requirements for well construction and disposal of flowback water, reflect the urgent need to minimize the risks posed by fracking,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, we remain disappointed with some provisions like continued reliance on the industry-run website FracFocus for disclosure of toxic chemicals, and the lack of a ban on fracking in our most treasured spaces.\u201dThe new regulations are expected to be the first in a series of rules governing fracking safety. The Obama administration is expected to issue rules designed to curb the release of methane, a greenhouse gas, from fracking wells.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Condition Cancer Research Is In", "Date": "2015-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Varmus, whose last day at the cancer institute is Tuesday, recently reflected on financial constraints in science, the fight against cancer and his own efforts to remain healthy. Our interview has been condensed and edited for space.Q. How has our investment in biomedical research changed?The N.I.H. is fundamental to a huge part of our national economy and our national goals. Our work determines how healthy we are going to be in the next century and what kind of health care is going to be delivered. The N.I.H. supplies a tremendous amount of funding to universities, one of this country\u2019s greatest assets. Not to support the N.I.H. in a way that at least keeps up with, or is at least modestly ahead of, inflation just seems like a tactical error.What are the consequences?The obvious things are fewer grants and fewer jobs, each grant less well funded than it should be.But it has also caused something to appear which has not been a characteristic of N.I.H.-funded research activities traditionally. A sense of hypercompetition has arisen as large numbers of new scientists are trained for positions and grants that no longer exist.You\u2019ve got to get this paper into that journal. You\u2019ve got to compete with 1,000 people to get a job in a distinguished academic institution. You want to have an environment where there is some sense of leisure, so you can think freely and feel that you can take chances.Wasn\u2019t it always that way?When I was a newly minted medic and came to the N.I.H. to do my government service, I was interested in finding new things to think about and making a contribution to our understanding of how cells respond to stimuli \u2014 how they become cancer cells. You weren\u2019t guaranteed success. But you were likely to succeed if you had good ideas and did some nice experiments and engaged with your colleagues. My work didn\u2019t have to be in one of the three best journals for me to feel like I could get a job.Right now people feel like they can\u2019t afford to fail.Where are we in the fight against cancer?One of the major advances we\u2019ve had as a result of cancer research is deep recognition of the complexity of cancer. It\u2019s not one disease, it\u2019s lots of different diseases. Every single cancer is different when you look at it on a genetic level.This is the most transforming thing that\u2019s happened. We are beginning to understand now how different sets of mutations increase or decrease the likelihood that somebody\u2019s going to respond to a therapy.Cancer goes through an evolutionary process that is complex and not fully understood. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of basic disease research to be done.Is that basic research getting done?People feel their likelihood of getting funded is greater if they work on things that may have a clinical application. I\u2019m worried about that, because I look at the big things that have changed the face of health care, and it\u2019s usually the result of some pioneering discovery not made in conjunction with the notion of how to treat somebody.You\u2019ve got to do clinical testing, but if we become slackers on funding the absolutely most fundamental things, we will not hit upon the real answers. To understand how a normal cell becomes a cancer cell \u2014 we can\u2019t lose sight of that.What\u2019s your advice on staying healthy?I don\u2019t want to go to my doctor, ever. I know flesh is heir to disease.I\u2019ve been taking aspirin every day. It can be protective against cancers, heart disease and some strokes.I believe in keeping cholesterol levels down and keeping a healthy lifestyle. I try to be on my bike or doing something every day. Not just for health \u2014 I choose the sports I like. It\u2019s a social event as well.I\u2019m a bit of a fanatic about exercise, but not because I think every day that I get on my bike or go for a run that I\u2019m somehow extending my life. I just feel better when I do it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Patching Up the Social Safety Net", "Date": "2015-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic Scene\u201cYou are right,\u201d conceded Mr. Cohen, the champion of the New Deal. \u201cHowever, a program for poor people will be a poor program.\u201dHere is what he meant: Only universal programs that served all Americans could achieve the broad political support needed to become embedded in society. Programs targeted at the poor would be stigmatized as charity, underfunded and left to wither.Consider it this way. Bill Clinton, a Democratic president, gave us welfare reform \u2014 cutting the main program of assistance to the poor. His Republican successor, George W. Bush, failed to privatize Social Security but expanded prescription drug coverage under Medicare.And yet today Mr. Cohen\u2019s maxim seems to have been relegated to the trash can of history \u2014 at best an irrelevant proposition, at worst an unfair one.From the expansion of the food stamp program to the promise of universal preschool and free community college for all, every one of the Obama administration\u2019s economic initiatives has been carefully targeted at the needy. The Affordable Care Act, perhaps the largest expansion of the safety net since Medicaid, was tailored to benefit the near poor.And it\u2019s not just President Obama. \u201cPresident Clinton did the same thing when he raised taxes in 1993,\u201d said Alan J. Auerbach, a specialist in tax policy at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThe focus is to provide benefits for the poor and shift the burden to pay for them on the rich.\u201dAppearances matter, too: Universal programs financed by broader taxes could appear fundamentally unfair in an era of rampant income inequality separating the very rich from the rest.But the alternative also poses risks. Carefully targeted social insurance financed by progressive taxes is likely to be both stingy and politically weak. And even if some programs like the earned-income tax credit can be hidden from view, as \u201ctax deductions\u201d rather than benefits, there is a point when such subterfuge may no longer work.As globalization put pressure on social policy across the world, he found, redistribution did not decline more in countries with targeted social programs than in those with universal systems of social insurance.Notably, whereas governments that offered universal public benefits did a better job at reducing income inequality in the 1980s and 1990s, by the 2000s the relationship had disappeared.Still, Professor Kenworthy remains sympathetic to Mr. Cohen\u2019s maxim. \u201cI still believe the fundamental logic of the argument that universalism has advantages,\u201d he told me.One reason that the relationship between universality and redistribution seems to have declined around the world is precisely that targeted programs shrank in the United States \u2014 replaced by the broader earned-income tax credit. In other words, universal systems look worse than before because the United States, with its weak social safety net, looks more universal.The shape of the safety net is not unimportant.This is not the only way to frame Mrs. Clinton\u2019s choices. The most critical goal of the next American government may be simply protecting the social insurance we have left.In his new book, \u201cWe Are Better Than This,\u201d Edward D. Kleinbard, a law professor at the University of Southern California, suggests we might build a better, more effective government, by raising top tax rates to where they were in the Clinton era and paring some personal tax deductions that benefit the better off.Politically, that would be momentous. And yet it would only raise federal tax revenues to roughly 22 percent from 20 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 still the smallest among advanced nations.The incontrovertible fact, as research by Mr. Kenworthy and others finds, is that social insurance in the United States does a worse job of closing the income gap than in any peer nation across the industrial world. The way things are going, it could become worse.As demands on Social Security and Medicare grow over time, pressure will be enormous to cut benefits, mostly at the top. If Mr. Cohen was right, this will drain political support from the only universal programs we have left. They may become poor programs too.The great irony, Professor Auerbach notes, is that \u201cinequality is increasing yet our ability to do anything about it is weakening.\u201d The main job for any Democratic president might not be to bolster the nation\u2019s social insurance apparatus but simply to hold the line.The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about the construction of the American social safety net, misstated the timing of President George W. Bush\u2019s expansion of prescription drug coverage under Medicare. It happened in 2003, before \u2014 not after \u2014 he tried to privatize Social Security.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}

But the person who appeared most eager to claim victory in the elections was the former president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who described the vote which brought his coalition of conservative parties control of 67 of the 98 departments as a \u201cdisavowal\u201d of the Socialist-led government.Whether that puts him in position to run again for president is not yet clear. Analysts said it was too early to predict, but there was no question he was back on the political stage and at least superficially in a powerful position. However, they added, he will have a hard road ahead.\u201cHe has to deal with something that is very difficult in terms of political tactics: he has to lure back those voters who drifted to the National Front but he also has to keep the centrist voters,\u201d said Jean-Yves Camus, the director of the Observatory of Radical Politics. \u201cIt\u2019s very tricky politically.\u201dAdded to that, Mr. Sarkozy is not personally popular and it is not yet clear that he will be able to persuade fellow conservative politicians to back him for the presidency again. Nonetheless, for now he appears to be the dominant voice of the opposition to the Socialist government.The National Front is likely to do better in the year-end regional elections because of differences in the voting system, Mr. Camus said. While the party managed to gain only 62 council member seats from among the 4,108 that were voted for on Sunday, they won more than a fifth of the popular vote, suggesting that if they maintain that level of support they could do very well in nationwide elections, he said.\u201cIt was still an excellent performance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe number of seats did not reflect the percentage that they won.\u201dDespite the results, the leaders of the Socialists, the largest of the left-leaning parties, appeared, at least for now, unwilling to change either their policies or the people running key government departments.While acknowledging that the Socialists had lost, the prime minister, Manuel Valls, attempted to reassure voters that the Socialist policies were right.Mr. Valls said, \u201cOur economy is doing better thanks to the reform that we\u2019ve implemented to improve the competitiveness of our companies, to support industry and encourage innovation.\u201d The problem with his strategy is that there has been little, if any, improvement in the job market, leaving many French people frustrated and feeling economically uncertain. And, there is little likelihood that there will be a major improvement before the end of the year when the next round of elections will be held, said Mr. Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9 of Sciences Po.And he said for the Socialist government to not show voters some effort at change is \u201celectorally speaking, purely suicidal.\u201d Another loser on the left was the dwindling Communist Party, which has in the past played a role in several left-leaning coalition governments, but on Sunday lost one of the two departments it controlled and earned just 100,000 votes nationwide, barely a half percent of those who voted.Ma\u00efa de la Baume contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Age of Acquiescence,\u2019 by Steve Fraser", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.For two years running, Oxfam International has traveled to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to make a request: Could the superrich kindly cease devouring the world\u2019s wealth? And while they\u2019re at it, could they quit using \u201ctheir financial might to influence public policies that favor the rich at the expense of everyone else\u201d?In 2014, when Oxfam arrived in Davos, it came bearing the (then) shocking news that just 85 individuals controlled as much wealth as half of the world\u2019s population combined. This January, that number went down to 80 individuals.Dropping this news in Davos is a great publicity stunt, but as a political strategy, it\u2019s somewhat baffling. Why would the victors of a class war choose to surrender simply because the news is out that they have well and truly won? Oxfam\u2019s answer is that the rich must battle inequality or they will find themselves in a stagnant economy with no one to buy their products. (Davos thought bubble: \u201cIsn\u2019t that what cheap credit is for?\u201d)Still, even if some of the elite hand-wringing about inequality is genuine, are reports really the most powerful weapons out there to fight for a more just distribution of wealth? Where are the sit-down strikes? The mass boycotts? The calls for expropriation? Where, in short, are the angry masses?Oxfam\u2019s Davos guilt trip doesn\u2019t appear in Steve Fraser\u2019s \u201cThe Age of Acquiescence: The Life and Death of American Resistance to Organized Wealth and Power,\u201d but these are the questions at the heart of this fascinating if at times meandering book. Fraser, a labor historian, argues that deepening economic hardship for the many, combined with \u201cinsatiable lust for excess\u201d for the few, qualifies our era as a second Gilded Age. But while contemporary wealth stratification shares much with the age of the robber barons, the popular response does not.As Fraser forcefully shows, during the first Gilded Age \u2014 which he defines loosely as the years between the end of the Civil War and the market crash of 1929 \u2014 American elites were threatened with more than embarrassing statistics. Rather, a \u201cbroad and multifaceted resistance\u201d fought for and won substantially higher wages, better workplace conditions, progressive taxation and, ultimately, the modern welfare state (even as they dreamed of much more).To solve the mystery of why sustained resistance to wealth inequality has gone missing in the United States, Fraser devotes the first half of the book to documenting the cut and thrust of the first Gilded Age: the mass strikes that shut down cities and enjoyed the support of much of the population; the Eight Hour Leagues that dramatically cut the length of the workday, fighting for the universal right to leisure and time \u201cfor what we will\u201d; the vision of a \u201c\u200a\u2018cooperative commonwealth\u2019 in place of the Hobbesian nightmare that Progress had become.\u201dHe reminds readers that although \u201cclass war\u201d is considered un-American today, bracing populist rhetoric was once the lingua franca of the nation. American presidents bashed \u201cmoneycrats\u201d and \u201ceconomic royalists,\u201d and immigrant garment workers demanded not just \u201cbread and roses\u201d but threatened \u201cbread or blood.\u201d Among many such arresting anecdotes is one featuring the railway tycoon George Pullman. When he died in 1897, Fraser writes, \u201chis family was so afraid that his corpse would be desecrated by enraged workers, they had it buried at night .\u2008.\u2008. in a pit eight feet deep, encased in floors and walls of steel-reinforced concrete in a lead-lined casket covered in layers of asphalt and steel rails.\u201dOf course violence went both ways. Protests and strikes consistently faced bloody attacks from both state forces and hired guns, prompting the formation of various armed worker militias. Populists and socialists were attacked as everything from \u201cungrateful hyenas\u201d to \u201cmad dogs,\u201d while conservative newspapers openly called on the state to \u201cexterminate\u201d the \u201cmob.\u201d The class war, in other words, was no mere metaphor.Fraser offers several explanations for the boldness of the post-Civil War wave of labor resistance, including, interestingly, the intellectual legacy of the abolition movement. The fight against slavery had loosened the tongues of capitalism\u2019s critics, forging a radical critique of the market\u2019s capacity for barbarism. With bonded labor now illegal, the target pivoted to factory \u201cwage slavery.\u201d This comparison sounds strange to contemporary ears, but as Fraser reminds us, for European peasants and artisans, as well as American homesteaders, the idea of selling one\u2019s labor for money was profoundly alien.This is key to Fraser\u2019s thesis. What \u00adfueled the resistance to the first Gilded Age, he argues, was the fact that many Americans had a recent memory of a different kind of economic system, whether in America or back in Europe. Many at the forefront of the resistance were actively fighting to protect a way of life, whether it was the family farm that was being lost to predatory creditors or small-scale artisanal businesses being wiped out by industrial capitalism. Having known something different from their grim present, they were capable of imagining \u2014 and fighting for \u2014 a radically better future.It is this imaginative capacity that is missing from our second Gilded Age, a theme to which Fraser returns again and again in the latter half of the book. The latest inequality chasm has opened up at a time when there is no popular memory \u2014 in the United States, at least \u2014 of another kind of economic system. Whereas the activists and agitators of the first Gilded Age straddled two worlds, we find ourselves fully within capitalism\u2019s matrix. So while we can demand slight improvements to our current conditions, we have a great deal of trouble believing in something else entirely.Fraser devotes several chapters to outlining the key \u201cfables\u201d which, he argues, have served as particularly effective \u00adresistance-avoidance tools. These range from the billionaire as rebel to the supposedly democratizing impact of mass stock ownership to the idea that contract work is a form of liberation. He also explores various forces that have a \u201cself-\u00adpolicing\u201d impact \u2014 from mass indebtedness to mass incarceration; from the fear of having your job deported to the fear of having yourself deported.With scarce use of story or development of characters, this catalog of disempowerment often feels more like an overlong list than an argument. And after reading hundreds of pages detailing depressing facts, Fraser\u2019s concluding note \u2014 that \u201ca new era of rebellion and transformation\u201d might yet be possible \u2014 rings distinctly hollow.This need not have been the case. Fraser spares only a few short paragraphs for those movements that are attempting to overcome the obstacles he documents \u2014 student-debt resisters, fast-food and Walmart workers fighting for a living wage, regional campaigns to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour or the various creative attempts to organize vulnerable immigrant workers. We hear absolutely nothing directly from the leaders of these contemporary movements, all of whom are struggling daily with the questions at the heart of this book.That\u2019s too bad. Because if hope is to be credible, we need to hear not just from yesterday\u2019s dreamers but from today\u2019s as well.THE AGE OF ACQUIESCENCEThe Life and Death of American Resistance to Organized Wealth and PowerBy Steve Fraser470 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $28.Naomi Klein\u2019s latest book, \u201cThis Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate,\u201d will be out in paperback in August.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "End This Corporate Welfare ", "Date": "2015-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWOODLAND, Calif. \u2014 AS someone who started a company that employs approximately 2,500 people in food processing and agribusiness, I used to wonder why so many Americans distrusted big business. I now have a good answer. I have observed too many of my fellow business leaders blatantly work with the government to increase their profits at taxpayer expense. A prime example is the federally-run Export-Import Bank. Its charter expires at the end of June and businesses and lobbyists are lining up to persuade Congress to reauthorize it. Ex-Im is a case study in corporate welfare. Founded during the New Deal, its mission is to \u201csupport jobs in the United States by facilitating the export of U.S. goods and services.\u201d In practice, it offers taxpayer-backed loans, guarantees and insurance to private companies. When a company profits from the bank\u2019s support, it pockets the money. If it defaults, taxpayers\u2019 pockets get picked.The bank\u2019s supporters claim that it will put $14 billion back into the Treasury over the next decade, a number derived from federally mandated accounting methods. Yet this analysis fails to account for the market risk of the bank\u2019s loans. The Congressional Budget Office, using the fair-value accounting method that is common in the private sector because it is considered more accurate, estimates that the Export-Import Bank will actually lose $2 billion over the next decade \u2014 a $200 million annual tab for taxpayers.It\u2019s private gain at the expense of public pain. Large companies in particular have taken a liking to it. In 2013, roughly 93 percent of the bank\u2019s loan guarantees by value benefited only five companies \u2014 including Caterpillar, General Electric and other multinational corporations with hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in annual profits \u2014 according to the Mercatus Center, a research center at George Mason University. In 2012, 83 percent benefited a single company: Boeing. Ex-Im also has a long history of assisting state-owned companies across the globe. It argues that a loan to, say, the airline Emirates will benefit the American economy because the airline buys Boeing\u2019s planes \u2014 but the loan also gives the airline a competitive advantage over its American rivals and transfers wealth to foreign states\u2019 coffers.With the bank\u2019s charter now set to expire \u2014 it has been periodically renewed by Congress, most recently in 2014 \u2014 these special interests are desperate to keep Ex-Im alive. Last month, the Exporters for Ex-Im Coalition organized a lobbying day on Capitol Hill, sharing a handout that claims the bank supports jobs and small businesses, and provides a service that no private lender would. But their claims must be dissected. Most important: The bank does not weigh the jobs it supports against those it destroys. By providing loans to foreign companies that compete with domestic ones, Ex-Im is actively eliminating American jobs. Nor are the bank\u2019s claims about being \u201ccritical\u201d to small businesses justified. Overall, fewer than 1 percent of America\u2019s small businesses receive support from the bank, according to the Mercatus Center. The other 99 percent are at a competitive disadvantage with the Ex-Im elite. As for those select few, the bank\u2019s data show that small businesses received only 19 percent of its total financing in 2013. And even this is misleading: Ex-Im defines small businesses as those having up to around $21 million in revenue or up to 1,500 employees \u2014 1,450 more than the Affordable Care Act\u2019s definition. Bank proponents will of course point to the few companies that can\u2019t obtain private financing as evidence of a supposed market failure. But the private market\u2019s refusal to finance some companies is a measure of its competency in evaluating risk. Federal bureaucrats often lack the same expertise or make decisions based on other criteria \u2014 see the four Ex-Im employees who last year were suspended or removed \u201camid investigations into allegations of gifts and kickbacks,\u201d according to The Wall Street Journal. Given this record, the private market\u2019s caution is wise, not wicked.Fortunately, not all business leaders are willing to participate in this farce. Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce \u2014 a business league whose supporters include myself, Charles and David Koch and several hundred others \u2014 opposes both the Export-Import Bank and the innumerable other examples of corporate welfare in Washington.More business leaders should follow suit. If they don\u2019t, Americans\u2019 perception that big business only serves its own interest will grow stronger, and free enterprise itself will become increasingly endangered.

{"Headline": "How a Rising Dollar Is Creating Trouble for Emerging Economies", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyThese are all parts of the same story: The soaring value of the American dollar is rippling across the globe. As it rises, it is threatening emerging economies where companies have taken on trillions\u2019 worth of dollar-based debt in recent years. The dollar rally has been driven by decisions by the Federal Reserve, which begins a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. In fact, anticipation of the Fed meeting, where officials are expected to signal that interest rate increases could be near, has driven the dollar even higher in the last couple of weeks.In effect, as Fed policy makers sit around a mahogany table in Washington to try to guide the United States economy toward prosperity, their actions are having outsize, often unpredictable impacts across the globe, owing to the dollar\u2019s central role in the global financial system.And rise the dollar has. Since the Federal Reserve signaled in summer 2013 that it would wind down its \u201cquantitative easing\u201d policy of buying billions of dollars in bonds using newly created money \u2014 that the gusher of dollars flowing into the global financial system would come to an end, in other words \u2014 the dollar is up 25 percent against a basket of commonly used international currencies.\u201cNow that the dollar has strengthened and rates are on the rise, it presents a risk and a challenge to many emerging markets in that their debts have become more onerous, more burdensome,\u201d said Hung Tran, an executive managing director at the Institute of International Finance, an association of global banks. \u201cThe challenge for authorities in emerging market countries is to understand to what degree their corporate sector is naked or exposed.\u201dCompanies in emerging markets that are primarily exporters might be O.K. After all, their revenue is in dollars, and so it should keep pace with rising debt service obligations. But for those focused domestically, like real estate developers or electric utilities, a more expensive dollar can make it much more costly to service debts. Money coming in is in a local currency like the Indian rupee or the Malaysian ringgit, and it suddenly takes a lot more of them to pay debts owed in dollars.In some economists\u2019 ears, that creates echoes of the crises that crushed East Asian economies in the late 1990s and Latin American economies in the early 2000s. In those cases, there was also a currency mismatch that sent the economies of South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and Argentina into a tailspin.The biggest difference this time around is that private companies, not governments, have incurred debt in a currency not their own. What is likely to follow are bankruptcies, layoffs and cost-cutting for individual companies that borrowed too aggressively. A vicious cycle of economic collapse and government austerity measures is harder to imagine.In a wide-ranging speech last fall wrestling with the global impact of Federal Reserve policy, Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman of the Fed (and former governor of the Bank of Israel, where he grappled with powerful spillover effects from the Fed\u2019s actions firsthand), discussed the risks emerging markets faced as rising interest rates in the United States drove up the dollar.\u201cIt does not seem that the overall risks to global financial stability are unusually elevated at this time, and they are very likely substantially less than they were going into the financial crisis,\u201d Mr. Fischer argued. \u201cNevertheless, it could be that some more vulnerable economies, including those that pursue overly rigid exchange rate policies, may find the road to normalization somewhat bumpier.\u201dThis, he said, makes clear communication about the Fed\u2019s intentions all the more important. With the central bank\u2019s meeting this week and the day of tighter money in the United States inching ever closer, the multitrillion-dollar question for the global economy is, Just how many of these companies will ride out the bumps, and how many more will crash?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Chides G.O.P. Over Proposed Program Cuts", "Date": "2015-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCLEVELAND \u2014 President Obama on Wednesday denounced the Republicans\u2019 latest budget as stingy and shortsighted, taking them to task for proposing to cut domestic programs that he said would yield more jobs and economic benefits for working people who are struggling financially.During an appearance here, Mr. Obama announced new initiatives \u2014 including about $230 million in federal money \u2014 to aid American manufacturers, and he argued that the Republican plan would set back the nation\u2019s economic recovery and hurt workers who have not yet had the chance to profit from it.\u201cThe budget that they\u2019re putting forward and the theories they\u2019re putting forward are a path to prosperity for those who have already prospered,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a harsh assessment of Republicans\u2019 economic vision. \u201cIt\u2019s a story of retreat.\u201dCharts showing how G.O.P budget proposals for 2016 contrast with President Obama\u2019s.\u201cIf they believe it\u2019s time to end the social contract that sustains so many of us, the basic bargain of shared sacrifice and shared responsibility, own it and make the argument, but you can\u2019t credibly claim that this vision is about helping working families get ahead,\u201d he told an audience of about 450. The trip was an example of how Mr. Obama is trying to compensate for his lack of clout in the Republican-held Congress by using the trappings of the presidency outside Washington. He is hoping to build public support for his domestic agenda in an attempt to pressure Republicans to compromise with him. \u201cIf President Obama was serious about expanding growth and opportunity, he\u2019d be working with Republicans on areas of common ground,\u201d said Cory Fritz, a spokesman for John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House. \u201cToday\u2019s stop in Cleveland was nothing more than a political stunt designed to double down on the same tax-and-spend policies that have failed middle-class families.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s speech amounted to an I-told-you-so defense of his policies, in which he shot down Republicans\u2019 harshest claims and predictions about his agenda \u2014 including warnings of job losses, stock market drops, $6.60 per gallon gas and trillion-dollar deficits. He even referred to Mr. Boehner\u2019s \u201cWhere are the jobs?\u201d campaign mantra.\u201cWell, after 12 million new jobs, a stock market that\u2019s more than doubled, deficits that have been cut by two-thirds, health care inflation at the lowest rate in nearly 50 years, manufacturing coming back, auto industry coming back, clean energy doubled, I\u2019ve come not only to answer that question, but I want to return to the debate that is central to this country and the alternative economic theory that\u2019s presented by the other side,\u201d Mr. Obama said.Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said the visit raised questions about when Mr. Obama \u201cis going to get off the campaign trail and start trying to get things done.\u201d\u201cImagine if he was going there to push for his trade agenda, or any of the other items on his agenda that are being slowed by Democrats,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. Indeed, Mr. Obama\u2019s stop in Cleveland, a city in the Rust Belt where skepticism about international trade agreements runs high, underscored the political squeeze facing the president as he pushes to accomplish major elements of his agenda during his final two years in office. Republicans have shown little interest in forging compromises with Mr. Obama on domestic initiatives that animate his party\u2019s core supporters, like free community college, subsidies for child care and paid leave, while Democrats are reluctant to back him on his bid for new trade deals.The budget debate unfolding in Washington this week dramatizes Mr. Obama\u2019s rift with Republicans. They are advocating holding to strict spending caps that would force deep cuts in national security and social programs, while the president wants to lift the limits in both areas by a total of about $75 billion.Mr. Obama\u2019s speech highlighted the differences between him and most Republicans.\u201cIt was one thing for them to argue against Obamacare before it was put in place,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s working even better than I expected, but it doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 evidence be damned \u2014 it\u2019s still \u2018a disaster.\u2019 Well, why?\u201dAt the same time, during a nearly 45-minute question-and-answer session after his speech, Mr. Obama criticized the political division that he said prevented like-minded Republicans from teaming with him even on basic things like funding the government or devoting federal money to building roads and bridges, an area in which Mr. Obama has repeatedly said he believes there is room for a bipartisan deal.\u201cConstant campaigning and the polarization of the bases and the inability, it seems, to just agree on a core set of facts means even when some of our Republican friends want to work with us, it\u2019s hard to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are worried that they\u2019ll get attacked, or they\u2019ll be viewed as compromisers, or they\u2019ll get a primary challenge by somebody further to the right.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tupperware\u2019s Sweet Spot Shifts to Indonesia ", "Date": "2015-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 The party had the feel of 1960s America, almost. A group of women, thrilled to get a break from the daily routine of hanging laundry and shuttling their children to and from school, sat in a circle, listening to a friend hawk plastic storage bowls in a dizzying array of pastels.Some shushed babies on their laps; others occasionally leaned in for juicy pieces of news.The women were, in fact, at a modern-day Tupperware party in the company\u2019s biggest market. The twist? That market is halfway around the world from the product\u2019s Massachusetts birthplace \u2014 in Indonesia.Once a fixture in middle-class American kitchens, Tupperware has become a bit of an afterthought in its home country even as its popularity has risen abroad. (Germany was the top marketplace until Indonesia slid past it two years ago.)Indonesia is, in many ways, in Tupperware\u2019s sweet spot. As the economy has taken off in recent years, an expanding middle class now has more disposable income for containers of all shapes and sizes that are sturdier than those found in local markets. And, as in 1960s America, many women stay at home to keep house and raise their children, creating a captive audience for parties run by saleswomen who have begun to sidle past conservative social mores and into the work force.\u201cThere are tens of millions of Indonesian women currently not in the work force who are potential targets to not only buy Tupperware, but also sell it,\u201d said Emma Allen, an economist in Jakarta.The company \u2014 whose business model is built on tapping into social networks \u2014 has also piggybacked on an Indonesian tradition, called an arisan, or \u201cgathering,\u201d in which women regularly meet with a set group of friends to catch up on family news, the latest recipes and neighborhood scuttlebutt.Sellers use some of the gatherings not only to push their products, but also to recruit new agents, who can repeat the pattern among other groups of friends. An added bonus in Indonesia: the arisan often serve as informal banks, with women pooling their money and giving the pot to one participant per gathering.Tupperware saleswomen say that can often help customers buy more expensive sets, some of which can run into the hundreds of dollars.At the party in Villa Mutiara, a quiet neighborhood on the outskirts of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, the differences from midcentury America were clear. Many of the potential buyers had arrived on scooters, not station wagons, and, unlike their American counterparts from last century, their hair was tucked away under Muslim jilbabs rather than teased into a bouffant.But their concerns about the Tupperware they were considering buying would not be alien to American women, past and present, whose jobs include stretching the family budget, while buying products that will last.Proof of longevity was enough of a priority at the Indonesian gathering that the bubbly sales agent, Rosa Amelia, took the unusual step of slamming a pink cookie container into the white-tiled floor in answer to the question, \u201cAre you sure they\u2019re indestructible?\u201dThe women were shocked enough to temporarily cease their background talk about cooking and the challenges of storing food in Indonesia\u2019s tropical heat. Then they burst out laughing, satisfied that the relatively expensive plastic containers were worth the price.Tupperware\u2019s Indonesian sales force, now about 250,000-strong, racked up sales of more than $200 million last year, according to the company.For some women who choose to join the salesteam, the company has provided a way out of poverty \u2014 about half the population lives on less than $2 a day \u2014 and prescribed social roles.Although women are increasingly joining the work force, the Indonesian government and religious groups have for decades pushed traditional values in which the primary roles of women are as wives and mothers. The country\u2019s 1974 Marriage Law states that the husband is the head of the family and the wife is the caretaker.As it has done in other emerging markets, Tupperware encouraged women to move past any insecurities about taking on a new role. The company has a campaign called \u201cChain of Confidence,\u201d in which it posts video interviews of saleswomen talking about how their lives have changed for the better. The company also has an inspirational campaign for Indonesia, \u201cTupperware She Can,\u201d that also posts aspirational videos.\u201cEveryone talks about how the dynamism of Asia is the emerging middle class, and the emerging middle class is driven by women who previously didn\u2019t have the opportunity,\u201d said Rick Goings, global chairman and chief executive of Tupperware Brands Corporation. \u201cI\u2019m not saying men didn\u2019t work hard, but there\u2019s a new opportunity for women in Asia.\u201dUpi Hariwati is one of the Indonesian women who has seized the opportunity. Four years ago, the 39-year-old wife and mother of a young son began looking for solutions after growing tired of her family\u2019s living paycheck to paycheck from her husband\u2019s job.In a testimonial for \u201cChain of Confidence,\u201d Ms. Upi said that when she started out as a Tupperware saleswoman, she had to deliver products to customers using public transportation minivans. But within two years, she says, she was earning enough that she bought a new car and a house. \u201cI became more confident, knowledgeable and disciplined,\u201d she said.Ms. Amelia, the saleswoman at the Villa Mutiara party, had a similar tale. Six years ago, she was trying to keep afloat a restaurant that she ran in South Jakarta with her husband. Then she was invited to a Tupperware party that she said changed her life.After being recruited as a saleswoman and struggling to get her husband to agree to let her take the job, she started off selling part-time, squeezing the parties in between her duties at the restaurant. Today she is a regional manager, running about 20 parties a month in and around Jakarta. Ms. Amelia, 41, earns the equivalent of about $2,400 a month \u2014 six-times her monthly profits from the restaurant, which they have sold.\u201cInitially, my husband refused to let me sell Tupperware even part-time because he thought it might affect the restaurant,\u201d Ms. Amelia said. \u201cNow he works for me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Traitors to Their Class", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou probably know from his weepy reminiscences that the speaker of the House, John Boehner, once worked as a bartender and a janitor, and took seven years to get out of college. Maybe you\u2019ve heard that Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin is a preacher\u2019s son who churned out burgers and fries at McDonald\u2019s. And you had to catch that bit from Senator Joni Ernst about putting bread bags over her shoes while growing up kind of poor in rural Iowa.People from humble beginnings often carry an extra load of empathy through the success of their later lives, a sense that, with a few bad breaks, things could have gone the other way.And there\u2019s the party of tough luck, pal. In the case of the three Republican leaders cited above, and most of those who aspire to be the G.O.P. presidential nominee next year, these Horatio Algerians for the new Gilded Age are working to keep the downtrodden down. They are traitors to their class, with all the strutting moral superiority that comes with the conversion.Ernst, the lump-of-coal-hearted new senator from Iowa, and Walker, who always seems to be promoting something that needs actuarial tables to disguise, at times sound as if they actively despise the poor.Last fall, Walker opposed raising the minimum wage in Wisconsin from the poverty-level $7.25 an hour. After a group of workers claimed that the threshold violated a state mandate to offer a \u201cliving wage,\u201d Walker\u2019s administration slapped them down. Even though a minimum-wage worker would have to put in 81 hours a week to afford a two-bedroom apartment in Wisconsin, Walker\u2019s people saw no need to offer a few pennies more to those earning the least.What\u2019s behind this? Part of it is Walker\u2019s fealty to the restaurant industry. Part of it is his inaccurate belief that raising the minimum wage kills jobs. And part of it is dewy-eyed nostalgia for the days when he was a lad earning his first paycheck under the Golden Arches. He made it. Why can\u2019t they?\u201cIn America, it is one of the few places left in the world where it doesn\u2019t matter what class you were born into,\u201d Walker said in Iowa in January. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what your parents do for a living.\u201dExcept it does. Much of the new evidence on the causes of inequality finds that moving up from one class to the other in America has gotten far more difficult. The rich, even doofus members of said class, get the right tutors that get them into the right schools where they make connections to get the right jobs. They never face the peril of losing everything because of say, a large medical bill, or the dead weight of a college loan.Senator Ernst loves to talk about growing up in the rosy patina of near-poverty. \u201cMy mom made all our clothes,\u201d she wrote on her campaign website. \u201cWe went to church every week, helped our neighbors when they needed it, and they did the same for us.\u201dSee, you deadbeats: Why can\u2019t you just stitch together your own clothes and grab an extra chicken wing at the church picnic if you\u2019re hungry? Of course, she opposed raising Iowa\u2019s minimum wage. And she thinks subsidizing health care for lower-middle-class families is a terrible idea. She\u2019s working, with most Republicans in Congress, to take away health care for millions of Americans.Giving the people who flip burgers, clean floors and stock grocery shelves a few dimes more an hour is not a handout. Offering working people some help on their insurance premiums does not promote dependence. Nor do those things hurt the economy \u2014 just the opposite.So where is this coming from? The class traitors guiding the Republican Party, and the harsh new federal budget unveiled this week, usually promote their policies using personal anecdotes. Their condescension toward the poor springs from their own narratives: They are virtuous because they made it, or vice versa. Those who haven\u2019t made a similar leap are weaklings. It\u2019s a variant of Mitt Romney\u2019s view that 47 percent of Americans are moochers. Stripped to its essence, it\u2019s a load of loathing for their former class, delivered on a plate of platitudes.Joe Nocera is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Awesome Feat at Berkshire Hathaway, Revisited", "Date": "2015-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesWarren Buffett is taking a victory lap, and on the 50th anniversary of his reign at Berkshire Hathaway he is entitled to it. From a failing New England textile company, Berkshire became the vehicle for one of capitalism\u2019s greatest investing feats.Until now, he has favored another method for measuring success: the change in the book value of the shares. That\u2019s an accounting metric. It is, basically, net assets, and he has said it is better than Berkshire\u2019s transitory market price at tracking the company\u2019s true worth. However you analyze it, Berkshire\u2019s long-term performance has been awesome. Using market value, he says, its shares gained 21.6 percent annually compared with 19.4 percent for book value and 9.9 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, with dividends. Using market returns, the shares gained a cumulative 1,826,163 percent since he took control.Consider that at the end of 2014, an investment of $100 in the 1965 Berkshire shares would be worth $1,826,163. For the same period, $100 in the index, with dividends, would have grown to $11,196. That\u2019s not shabby. But it\u2019s a lot less than the Berkshire investment \u2014 $1,814,967 less. So it may seem churlish to quibble. But it\u2019s worth raising some questions, if only because Mr. Buffett has invited them. Performance is critical. He says that if he doesn\u2019t outperform the market, investors shouldn\u2019t trust him with their money.Until this year, he has invoked book value: Page 2 of his letter would include the book value return, the S.&P. return and a third column, \u201crelative results,\u201d which showed how he was doing in comparison with the index. Now that comparison is gone. If that column existed in the current report, it would show that he trailed the S.&.P. again, using book value. By shifting to the market value metric \u2014 for the first time in 50 years \u2014 his returns look better. Would he have added a table on his golden anniversary showing market value if it had been a bad year for Berkshire in the stock market, whose judgment he has often disdained? I don\u2019t know. Mr. Buffett declined to comment.In the current letter, Mr. Buffett says that book value and intrinsic value \u2014 his estimate of the true value of the company, which he will not publicly reveal \u2014 have diverged since Berkshire\u2019s early years. (Intrinsic value, which is at the core of his investing, represents \u201cthe discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life,\u201d in his words. That calculation is subjective, depending on judgments about factors like a business\u2019s prospects, its management\u2019s ability now and in the future, and the likely path of interest rates and the economy.)In that letter, he says: \u201cOur emphasis has shifted in a major way to owning and operating large businesses. Many of these are worth far more than their cost-based carrying value. But that amount is never revalued upward no matter how much the value of these companies has increased. Consequently, the gap between Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value and its book value has materially widened.\u201dThat makes sense. Berkshire\u2019s subsidiaries, like See\u2019s Candies, Geico, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway and Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company, are being carried on Berkshire\u2019s books at a fraction of their real value, he says. On the other hand, retained earnings from those companies, which are reinvested, do, in large part, show up elsewhere in the ledger. That\u2019s why, over the long run, he has said, book value is a worthwhile metric.\u201cThe new numbers don\u2019t change my probability analysis,\u201d Mr. Mehta said. \u201cWarren Buffett has been an extraordinary investor. But he hasn\u2019t been doing as well recently.\u201d Mr. Mehta\u2019s calculations show that over his first 25 years at Berkshire, Mr. Buffett\u2019s average annual return was 24 percent using book value and 30 percent using market value, compared with 10 percent for the S.&P. 500. Over his second 25 years, his performance was still outstanding: 15 percent for book value, 14 percent for market value and 10 percent for the index. The last six years reveal a different picture: 13 percent for book value, 15 percent for market value and 17 percent for the index. That\u2019s no disaster, but Mr. Buffett didn\u2019t meet his own standard: He frequently underperformed the market.There\u2019s no shame in that. Virtually everyone underperforms the market sometimes. To outperform it consistently, as Mr. Buffett has done over most of his career, is exceedingly rare. That\u2019s worth celebrating, even if it\u2019s also worth asking why the recent years haven\u2019t been extraordinary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pritzker Prize for Frei Otto, German Architect, Is Announced After His Death", "Date": "2015-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Otto, 89, died in Germany on Monday, two weeks before he was to be named this year\u2019s laureate, the prize jury said. He is perhaps best known for roof canopies designed for the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, admired for their blend of lightness and strength.\u201cHe has embraced a definition of architect to include researcher, inventor, form-finder, engineer, builder, teacher, collaborator, environmentalist, humanist, and creator of memorable buildings and spaces,\u201d the jury said in its citation.The Pritzker is regarded as architecture\u2019s highest honor and usually goes to a living architect. The committee said it was the first time that a winner had died before the announcement was made.Mr. Otto learned of his selection early this year when Martha Thorne, the prize\u2019s executive director, flew to Stuttgart to inform him of the jury\u2019s choice. He was blind but otherwise in good health, the panel said. Mr. Otto was honored and surprised, according to Edward Lifson, a spokesman for the prize.\u201cI\u2019ve never done anything to gain this prize,\u201d Mr. Otto was quoted as saying. \u201cPrizewinning is not the goal of my life. I try to help poor people, but what shall I say here \u2014 I\u2019m very happy.\u201dMr. Otto may not have been a household name, but he was widely esteemed in the profession. Prominent architects had quietly pushed for him to receive the award for years.\u201cTime waits for no man,\u201d said Peter Palumbo, the Pritzker chairman, in a statement, calling Mr. Otto\u2019s death \u201ca sad and striking example of this truism.\u201dThe announcement was originally to be made on March 23. The architect Frank Gehry was to award Mr. Otto the prize at a ceremony on May 15 at the New World Center in Miami. That will proceed as scheduled, with past Pritzker laureates speaking there about Mr. Otto\u2019s life and work.Mr. Otto first became known for tent structures used as temporary pavilions at the Federal Garden Show in Germany and other events in the 1950s.Mr. Otto often designed in collaboration with others, collaborating with Shigeru Ban on Japan\u2019s pavilion for the 2000 Hannover Expo in Germany and with Rolf Gutbrod on the West German pavilion at the Montreal Expo of 1967.Born in Siegmar, outside Chemnitz in eastern Germany, Mr. Otto grew up in Berlin. He designed glider planes as a hobby, fascinated by the structural forces at work when thin membranes are stretched over light frames.During service as a pilot in the Luftwaffe during World War II, he was captured near Nuremberg, Germany, and spent two years as a prisoner of war near Chartres in France, where he worked as a camp architect, learning to build various structures with the minimal materials available.After the war Mr. Otto returned to study architecture at the Technical University of Berlin, where he earned a doctorate in civil engineering in 1954.In a clear reaction to the heavy columned buildings commissioned under the Third Reich, Mr. Otto\u2019s work was lightweight, democratic, low-cost and sometimes temporary.After a trip through the United States, where he viewed the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, Eero Saarinen, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and others, Mr. Otto became a freelance architect in 1952, opening an office in Berlin. He went on to found several institutions dedicated to lightweight structures.He was inspired by \u201cnatural phenomena \u2014 from birds\u2019 skulls to soap bubbles and spiders\u2019 webs,\u201d the British architect Richard Rogers, a member of the Pritzker jury and a past laureate, said in a statement prepared before Mr. Otto\u2019s death.Mr. Otto\u2019s work has been widely recognized. In 2006, for example, he won the 18th annual Praemium Imperiale prize for architecture, awarded by the Japan Art Association; in 2005 he received the Royal Gold Medal for architecture from the Royal Institute of British Architects.\u201cFrei Otto is one of the great architects and engineers of the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Rogers said. \u201cHis work has inspired and influenced modern architecture, as we all learn to do more with less, and to trade monumental structures for economy, light and air.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about the awarding of the Pritzker Prize to the German architect Frei Otto, who died on Monday, misstated the given name and the surname of an architect who collaborated with Mr. Otto on the West German pavilion for the Montreal Expo in 1967. He was Rolf Gutbrod, not Ralph Gurbrod.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Snookered Isle", "Date": "2015-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2016 election is still 19 mind-numbing, soul-killing months away. There is, however, another important election in just six weeks, as Britain goes to the polls. And many of the same issues are on the table. Unfortunately, economic discourse in Britain is dominated by a misleading fixation on budget deficits. Worse, this bogus narrative has infected supposedly objective reporting; media organizations routinely present as fact propositions that are contentious if not just plain wrong.Needless to say, Britain isn\u2019t the only place where things like this happen. A few years ago, at the height of our own deficit fetishism, the American news media showed some of the same vices. Allegedly factual articles would declare that debt fears were driving up interest rates with zero evidence to support such claims. Reporters would drop all pretense of neutrality and cheer on proposals for entitlement cuts. In the United States, however, we seem to have gotten past that. Britain hasn\u2019t.The narrative I\u2019m talking about goes like this: In the years before the financial crisis, the British government borrowed irresponsibly, so that the country was living far beyond its means. As a result, by 2010 Britain was at imminent risk of a Greek-style crisis; austerity policies, slashing spending in particular, were essential. And this turn to austerity is vindicated by Britain\u2019s low borrowing costs, coupled with the fact that the economy, after several rough years, is now growing quite quickly.Simon Wren-Lewis of Oxford University has dubbed this narrative \u201cmediamacro.\u201d As his coinage suggests, this is what you hear all the time on TV and read in British newspapers, presented not as the view of one side of the political debate but as simple fact. Yet none of it is true.Was the Labour government that ruled Britain before the crisis profligate? Nobody thought so at the time. In 2007, government debt as a percentage of G.D.P. was close to its lowest level in a century (and well below the level in the United States), while the budget deficit was quite small. The only way to make those numbers look bad is to claim that the British economy in 2007 was operating far above capacity, inflating tax receipts. But if that had been true, Britain should have been experiencing high inflation, which it wasn\u2019t.Still, wasn\u2019t Britain at risk of a Greek-style crisis, in which investors could lose confidence in its bonds and send interest rates soaring? There\u2019s no reason to think so. Unlike Greece, Britain has retained its own currency and borrows in that currency \u2014 and no country fitting this description has experienced that kind of crisis. Consider the case of Japan, which has far bigger debt and deficits than Britain ever did yet can currently borrow long-term at an interest rate of just 0.32 percent.Which brings me to claims that austerity has been vindicated. Yes, British interest rates have stayed low. So have almost everyone else\u2019s. For example, French borrowing costs are at their lowest level in history. Even debt-crisis countries like Italy and Spain can borrow at lower rates than Britain pays. What about growth? When the current British government came to power in 2010, it imposed harsh austerity \u2014 and the British economy, which had been recovering from the 2008 slump, soon began slumping again. In response, Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s government backed off, putting plans for further austerity on hold (but without admitting that it was doing any such thing). And growth resumed. If this counts as a policy success, why not try repeatedly hitting yourself in the face for a few minutes? After all, it will feel great when you stop.Given all this, you might wonder how mediamacro gained such a hold on British discourse. Don\u2019t blame economists. As Mr. Wren-Lewis points out, very few British academics (as opposed to economists employed by the financial industry) accept the proposition that austerity has been vindicated. This media orthodoxy has become entrenched despite, not because of, what serious economists had to say.Still, you can say the same of Bowles-Simpsonism in the United States, and we know how that doctrine temporarily came to hold so much sway. It was all about posturing, about influential people believing that pontificating about the need to make sacrifices \u2014 or, actually, for other people to make sacrifices \u2014 is how you sound wise and serious. Hence the preference for a narrative prioritizing tough talk about deficits, not hard thinking about job creation.As I said, in the United States we have mainly gotten past that, for a variety of reasons \u2014 among them, I suspect, the rise of analytical journalism, in places like The Times\u2019s The Upshot. But Britain hasn\u2019t; an election that should be about real problems will, all too likely, be dominated by mediamacro fantasies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Establishment Populism Rising", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySummers\u2019s ascendance is a reflection of the abandonment by much of the party establishment of neo-liberal thinking, premised on the belief that unregulated markets and global trade would produce growth beneficial to worker and C.E.O. alike.Summers\u2019s analysis of current economic conditions suggests that free market capitalism, as now structured, is producing major distortions. These distortions, in his view, have resulted in gains of $1 trillion annually to those at the top of the pyramid, and losses of $1 trillion every year to those in the bottom 80 percent.\u201cThe core problem,\u201d according to Summers, is thatthere aren\u2019t enough jobs, and if you help some people, you can help them get the jobs, but then someone else won\u2019t get the jobs. And unless you\u2019re doing things that are affecting the demand for jobs, you\u2019re helping people win a race to get a finite number of jobs, and there are only so many of them.He adds that he is \u201call for\u201d more schooling and job training, but as an answer to the problems of the job marketplace, \u201cit is fundamentally an evasion.\u201dThis line of thought has strong appeal to liberal economists and policy makers who argue that government must intervene to create more demand for workers, primarily by spending more, especially spending that goes to private contractors who would then start hiring.Summers dismissed as palliative such relatively modest proposals as supplementing the earnings of low-wage workers by increasing the earned-income tax credit and expanding eligibility for the refundable credit.If we had the same income distribution in the United States that we did in 1979, the top 1 percent would have $1 trillion less today [in annual income], and the bottom 80 percent would have $1 trillion more. That works out to about $700,000 [a year for] for a family in the top 1 percent, and works out to about $11,000 a year for a family in the bottom 80 percent.In other words, any attempt to correct the contemporary pattern in income distribution would require large and controversial changes in tax policy, regulation of the workplace, and intervention in the economy to expand employment and to raise wages.To counter the weak employment market, Summers called for major growth in government expenditures to fill needs that the private sector is not addressing:In our society, whether it is taking care of the young or taking care of the old, or repairing a lot that needs to be repaired, there is a huge amount of very valuable work that needs to be done. It\u2019s much less clear, to use a modern phrase, that there\u2019s a viable business model for getting it done. And I guess the reason why I think there is going to need to be a lot of reflection on the role of government going forward is that, if I\u2019m right, that there\u2019s vitally important work to be done for which there is no standard capital business model that will get it done. That suggests important roles for public policy.Summers also calls for significant increases in the progressivity of the United States tax system. He would eliminate or modify many of the tax breaks that now provide most of their benefits to the affluent, including the conversion of the mortgage interest deduction into a credit. \u201cWhile deductions deliver a larger benefit to tax payers in higher tax brackets, credits deliver the same benefits to all tax payers, making the tax code more progressive,\u201d the report notes. In addition, the report presses for much tougher rules governing the taxation of corporate overseas income.Summers\u2019s policy proposals have been praised by former critics.In his not-yet-published pro-Summers essay, Baker writes:The idea that an economy could suffer from a persistent shortage of demand is an enormous switch for Summers or anyone who had been adhering to the economic orthodoxy in the three decades prior to the crisisin 2008. Baker goes on to argue that Summers \u201cnow recognizes that the financial system needs serious regulation.\u201dSome economists disagree with Summers. David Autor, a professor of economics at M.I.T., wrote in an email that Summers seemsto presuppose that we have entered an era of secular stagnation with perennially insufficient demand. I don\u2019t share this pessimism, and I think many indicators point in the right direction: employment growth, wage trends, inflation, energy prices, even inequality.In a follow-up email, Summers took note of Dean Baker\u2019s assertion that Summers had changed his views, replying that John Maynard Keynesis said to have responded to a similar question by saying \u2018when the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do sir?\u2019 Much has changed since the 1990s, including protracted shortfalls in demand, a dramatic decline in labor\u2019s share of income, the pulling away of the top 1 percent, the possible emergence of secular stagnation, and the financial crisis. So of course my policy views have evolved.Many of the policies outlined by Summers \u2014 especially on trade, taxation, financial regulation and worker empowerment \u2014 are the very policies that divide the Wall-Street-corporate wing from the working-to-middle-class wing of the Democratic Party. Put another way, these policies divide the money wing from the voting wing.Summers has forced out in the open a set of choices that Hillary Clinton has so far avoided, choices that even if she attempts to elide them will amount to a signal of where her loyalties lie.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "M. Stanton Evans, Who Helped Shape Conservative Movement, Is Dead at 80 ", "Date": "2015-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA longtime friend, Patrick S. Korten, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.Mr. Evans was the editor of The Indianapolis News, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, a radio and television commentator, a journalism teacher and the author of a raft of books, including a defense of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Republican of Wisconsin, in his anti-communist crusade.Mr. Evans said he became a conservative in 1949, as a teenager, after reading George Orwell\u2019s dystopian novel \u201c1984\u201d at the height of the Cold War.\u201cIt was about communism,\u201d he said in an interview for this obituary in 2010. \u201cI said: \u2018Well, I\u2019m against communism. What am I for?\u2019\u00a0\u201dOne of his first contributions to the conservative cause was perhaps the most significant. At 26, he drafted the statement of principles upon which Young Americans for Freedom, the first substantial national conservative organization, was created in September 1960. He was chosen for the task because of his editorial writing in Indianapolis.The Sharon Statement \u2014 so-called because the founding meeting was held at William F. Buckley Jr.\u2019s home in Sharon, Conn. \u2014 drew on the major streams of conservative thought, including religious freedom, free-market economics and an unbending resistance to communism.The statement began by asserting \u201cforemost among the transcendent values is the individual\u2019s use of his God-given free will.\u201d It viewed the United States Constitution as the consummate prescription for limited government, calling it \u201cthe best arrangement yet devised for empowering government to fulfill its proper role, while restraining it from the concentration and abuse of power.\u201dWhen government interferes with the market economy, the statement said, \u201cit tends to reduce the moral and physical strength of the nation.\u201d Finally, it said, \u201cthe forces of international communism are, at present, the greatest single threat\u201d to liberty. \u201cThe United States,\u201d it added, \u201cshould stress victory over, rather than coexistence with, this menace.\u201dMore than a manifesto for young conservatives, however, the document proved to be a seminal document in bringing different kinds of conservatives together. Mr. Evans worked to unify conservatives for many years, especially as head of the American Conservative Union from 1971 to 1977. Under Mr. Evans, the conservative union, which sought to function as an umbrella organization for the right, took a hard line in dealing with the White House, even when a Republican occupied it.The union and other conservatives were disillusioned by President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s wage and price controls and his opening to China. They were equally disheartened when Nixon\u2019s successor, Gerald R. Ford, picked Nelson A. Rockefeller, the former governor of New York and a longtime enemy of conservatives, to be vice president. And when the Ford administration began negotiations to turn over the Panama Canal to Panama, they revolted and lined up behind Ronald Reagan in his race for the 1976 Republican nomination. Under Mr. Evans, the conservative union joined the landmark case testing the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974. With other plaintiffs, including the generally liberal American Civil Liberties Union, the conservative union argued that limits on campaign contributions and spending violated the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech.The conservative union spent about $250,000 on independent ads, on both radio and in newspapers, in the state attacking Mr. Ford over the canal. In one radio ad, Mr. Evans told primary voters: \u201cRonald Reagan would not cave in to Castro and says American sovereignty in Panama must be maintained. The choice for North Carolina Republicans is clear.\u201d The Reagan campaign had been faltering, but the ads helped give Reagan his first primary victory. In a 2006 interview, Mr. Evans called it one of \u201cthe most important elections in terms of the conservative movement\u201d and \u201ca crucial turning point\u201d for Reagan\u2019s nearly successful run for the 1976 presidential nomination.Mr. Evans\u2019s career as an author or co-author began in 1961 with \u201cRevolt on the Campus,\u201d an account of rising college conservatism. His most recent book was \u201cStalin\u2019s Secret Agents: The Subversion of Roosevelt\u2019s Government,\u201d written with Herbert Romerstein and published in 2012.His 2007 book, \u201cBlacklisted by History: The Untold Story of Senator Joe McCarthy and His Fight Against America\u2019s Enemies,\u201d argued that while McCarthy might have made mistakes and occasionally gone too far in his campaign to root out communists from government, he did identify many subversives and \u201csummoned the nation to a firm-willed resistance to the communist challenge, both abroad and on the home front.\u201dMr. Evans left The Indianapolis News after 15 years in 1974 (it ceased publication in 1999), but he continued to comment widely on CBS Radio, National Public Radio and the Voice of America.The Sharon Statement and the conservative movement, he said, ultimately had mixed results. They succeeded in helping to bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union, he said in the 2010 interview. But \u201cthere were many, many lost opportunities,\u201d he added, \u201cor at least failures to do anything effective regarding this domestic spending issue, which is now so far out of control,\u201d as well as on \u201ccultural issues, educational issues.\u201d There, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we did so well.\u201d Medford Stanton Evans was born in Kingsville, Tex., on July 20, 1934. He grew up in Oak Ridge, Tenn., where his father worked in security for the Manhattan Project, and in Mount Rainier, Md., where his father had a similar role with the Atomic Energy Commission. Mr. Evans graduated from Yale in 1955 and worked for the conservative magazines National Review, founded that year by Mr. Buckley, and Human Events before going to Indianapolis.Mr. Evans, who lived in Hamilton, Va., about 50 miles west of Washington, had no immediate family survivors. He married Sue Ellen Moore in 1962. They divorced in 1974. After leaving The Indianapolis News, he taught journalism at Troy University in Alabama for more than 30 years. From 1977 to 2002 he led the National Journalism Center in Washington, which was established with financial help from the conservative union. Mr. Evans acknowledged that his reputation probably attracted conservatives to the center to train under him \u2014 among them were the commentators Ann Coulter and John Fund \u2014 but many of his students, like the ABC News reporter Terry Moran, became reporters rather than columnists, he said, and he had no idea of their ideology. \u201cI tell my students,\u201d he said, \u201ceven if you are an opinion journalist, your opinion should be based on facts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Delight or Dread as Euro Falls", "Date": "2015-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 For Herv\u00e9 Montjotin, chief executive of the French trucking and logistics group Norbert Dentressangle, the euro\u2019s steep plunge against the dollar could not be more welcome.In the months since his company bought Jacobson, an American contract logistics company, the currency\u2019s decline \u2014 down about 23 percent over the past year \u2014 has meant a windfall when dollars earned in the United States are translated back into euros.\u201cWe bought a profitable business, and that business now makes 20 percent more in euros than when we got it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve either been very skilled or very lucky.\u201dMillions of businesspeople on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as tourists planning trips in one direction or the other, are now watching with delight or dread as Europe\u2019s main currency drops ever closer to parity with the dollar.On Wednesday afternoon in Paris, the euro was trading at $1.0567. The currency has declined nearly 13 percent in the first months of 2015 alone and is at its lowest level since early 2003. The euro peaked at almost $1.60 in April 2008, as the European Central Bank was warning of impending interest rate increases despite the financial crisis that was beginning to be felt in the United States.The current plunge reflects differences in economic outlook, interest rates and monetary policies in Europe and the United States that in many ways favor the Americans \u2014 unless they are American companies trying to sell their wares to Europeans.For the United States, which already runs a substantial trade deficit with the rest of the world, a weaker euro might only widen that gap, as German cars, Spanish wines and French luxury goods become more price-competitive. Chad Moutray, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, warned that the strong dollar was \u201ca major headwind\u201d for American companies and said that executives were \u201cless happy\u201d than they were a few months ago.\u201cPeople recognize that the dollar is strengthening for the right reasons,\u201d Mr. Moutray said, citing the relatively strong United States economy and the signals that the Federal Reserve may be closer to raising interest rates \u2014 a lure to foreign investors and a further spur to the dollar \u2014 even as the European Central Bank is keeping interest rates at historical lows. Still, he added, \u201cthe dollar is getting to a level where it\u2019s harder to compete against the Europeans.\u201dThe happier Americans would be tourists, who during the coming spring break or summer months will find that a meal in a fancy French restaurant or a Mediterranean beach holiday costs much less than it would have a year ago. Europeans visiting New York or California, of course, will find that their euros won\u2019t stretch nearly as far this year.The sagging euro is only part of the story. The dollar is on its biggest surge since the mid-1990s \u2014 up 19 percent over the past 12 months against a basket of global currencies that includes the Japanese yen and the British pound.But the euro is the standout. And it has further room to fall, in many analysts\u2019 view. \u201cThe market is starting to get parity in its sights,\u201d Lee Hardman, a currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London, said, estimating that a one-to-one exchange rate could be reached within weeks. \u201cThe momentum is clearly for a weaker euro.\u201dPart of the euro\u2019s downturn stems from the existential questions that continue to dog the currency bloc, as dramatized by Greece\u2019s continuing struggle with its creditors over revised bailout terms.The bigger factor, though, is the impact of the European Central Bank\u2019s program, which began this week, to buy \u20ac1.1 trillion in bonds by September 2016, while also holding its official interest rates at low, or in some cases even negative, levels. Those policies are meant to stoke the economy, but they are prompting global investors to seek better places to get a return on their money \u2014 like dollar-based stocks and bonds.Even before the central bank\u2019s bond-buying began, investor anticipation was pushing European interest rates to new lows. On Wednesday, the yield on 10-year German government bonds was about 0.23 percent \u2014 while the comparable United States Treasury bill was yielding about 2.00 percent.That is the largest such gap, or \u201cspread,\u201d since 1989, according to Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. And it has unleashed a tsunami of capital flows from Europe to the United States. That trend seems likely to continue for now, whether or not the euro reaches parity with the dollar.\u201cParity is a nice psychological thing, but it has no real meaning,\u201d Mr. Chandler said. \u201cBefore it\u2019s over I think we\u2019ll test the euro\u2019s historic lows.\u201d That would be around 82 United States cents, he said, a level last hit in October 2000, when American interest rates were significantly higher than in Europe.The euro could hit a new trough next year, he said, noting that although the European Central Bank\u2019s easy money policy was set to run through at least early autumn 2016, by that time the Federal Reserve might have raised its main interest rate target above 1 percent \u2014 up from near zero currently.That could mean continued struggles for American exporters.A Duke/CFO Magazine survey of United States companies published on Wednesday found that around two-thirds of the big American exporters polled reported a negative impact from the strong dollar.\u201cWe are in a midst of an ugly contest to see whether the eurozone, Japan or Canada can depreciate the most against the U.S. dollar, and China is probably next,\u201d Campbell R. Harvey, a Fuqua School of Business professor, said in a statement accompanying the survey. \u201cU.S. exporters are being punished by these competitive depreciations, and this will lead to lower profits and less employment.\u201dIf the strong dollar does continue to pose those sorts of economic threats, of course, the Fed might alter its thinking about when to raise interest rates. So far, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, has said that she sees factors like the strong dollar and weak oil price to be largely balanced.But for the struggling eurozone, where unemployment is still averaging above 11 percent and where economies have stalled in most of the currency union\u2019s 19 member countries, there is much to recommend a weaker euro.Speaking in Frankfurt on Wednesday, Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, credited the falling currency, along with lower oil prices and the central bank\u2019s own policies, with having recently lifted the outlook for economic growth in the bloc. A weak euro also helps the central bank in its battle to rekindle inflation from its worrisome lows, since it raises the prices of imported goods.Mr. Montjotin, the Norbert Dentressangle chief, noted that the weak euro was also helping his business by making companies in France, Spain and Italy more competitive globally and thus raising demand for his company\u2019s services.He acknowledged some drawbacks. The company\u2019s American debt is now 20 percent heavier in euro terms, he noted. And as the euro falls, it negates part of the positive impact of the lower price of oil, which is priced in dollars.\u201cOn balance, though,\u201d Mr. Montjotin concluded, \u201cit is positive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Job Growth Was Fantastic Last Month. So Why Aren\u2019t Wages Rising More?", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Jobs ReportThe 295,000 jobs the nation added in February was comfortably above expectations, drove the unemployment rate down two-tenths of a percentage point to 5.5 percent, and completed the best stretch for job creation in nearly 15 years. Over the last six months, the nation has added just shy of 300,000 jobs a month, the strongest number since the six months ended in March 2000.This time a year ago, the economy was locked in a yearslong tepid recovery that involved adding 2 to 2.5 million jobs a year. That has now hit 3.3 million, and will soon hit 3.5 million if this pace of job growth keeps up. This is pretty terrific news by any standard.But what is a little more curious is that while the evidence of a truly robust jobs recovery is obvious in this and other recent readings on the labor market, the evidence of the two other trends that economy-watchers are hoping to see is somewhere between murky and nonexistent.The absence of meaningful gains in American workers\u2019 pay has been one of the lingering problems in the economy. With high rates of job growth and an unemployment rate that is down near normal, healthy levels, you would expect workers to have more leverage to demand raises. We\u2019ve seen anecdotal evidence that is happening, including the major employers Walmart and Aetna voluntarily increasing their wages for lower-level workers.But the latest jobs numbers offer no real evidence this is an economywide trend. Average hourly earnings rose only 0.1 percent in the month, below forecasts. Over the last year, that number has risen only 1.98 percent, actually down a bit from a few months ago. If there is good news, it is that the sharp 0.5 percent gain reported in January was not revised downward, but it\u2019s not a great solace.A steep drop in oil prices and a rise in the value of the dollar mean that inflation is very low right now, so Americans are seeing inflation-adjusted wage gains despite the paltry wage increases. But in what has been an important open question \u2014 whether wages are set to rise in a material way in 2015 \u2014 the latest numbers point toward the negative.Moreover, the unemployment rate fell mostly for not-so-good reasons in February, with the labor force actually shrinking as fewer people were looking for a job. That data is volatile and the labor force expanded a lot in January, so one shouldn\u2019t make much of it, but despite the reported strong job gains and fall in unemployment, the proportion of the population with a job was actually unchanged in February.This all creates an interesting puzzle for the Federal Reserve as it tries to gauge when to raise interest rates.On the other hand, the lack of progress on wages and lack of progress in pulling people into the labor force give plenty of ammunition to those officials who believe that there remains plenty of slack in the labor market and that it wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing in the world for the Fed to let the economy run a little hot for a while to try to change those trends.It seems sensible that financial markets acted as if the news made it slightly more likely that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates sooner rather than later, with, for example, long-term interest rates and the dollar both rising on the news. But the report itself makes the debate over what the best policy would be more cloudy rather than less.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Ever-Bleaker Syria, From All Vantage Points ", "Date": "2015-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Syria conflict began four years ago this week with protests calling for political reforms inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings elsewhere in the Middle East. Since then, it has repeatedly metastasized: President Bashar al-Assad unleashed soldiers and thugs to quell the unrest; the opposition spawned armed rebel groups; foreign powers poured in military aid; and the resulting violence spread chaos in increasingly large expanses of territory, allowing extremist groups to establish footholds and increase their power.Syria enters its fifth year of conflict with few signs that the war will end soon. International efforts to bring the warring parties together for peace talks have fallen dormant, and the United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, has made little progress on even his modest goal of a short-term cease-fire in only one of Syria\u2019s many battleground cities.A look at the conflict that has dismembered Syria and inflamed the region with one of the world\u2019s worst religious and sectarian wars.Humanitarian organizations issued a barrage of reports for the anniversary of the war\u2019s beginning that quantify how hard life has become for Syrians.About half of the country\u2019s prewar population has fled from home, according to the United Nations, and nearly four million people have become refugees abroad, putting large burdens on neighboring countries like Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.\u201cThe numbers are staggering,\u201d said Valerie Amos, the departing emergency relief coordinator for the United Nations. \u201cThey are so staggering that they have become almost meaningless to people.\u201dFor Syrian civilians in the country, the war has meant a downward spiral of death, uncertainty, poverty and displacement.A satellite image analysis reveals vast devastation in major cities across Syria from the civil war that started nearly four years ago.Nayef Abdul-Qader, a teacher, fled his home in the village of Qursaya in northern Syria with his wife and six children early in the war because fighting had erupted nearby and the local rebels said they needed time to clear government forces from the area.The family returned later to find their home damaged, fields burned and government forces shelling continuously. But with nowhere else to go, the family stayed. Mr. Abdul-Qader\u2019s school had closed, and he then lost his salary because someone had told the government that he had joined the rebels. His family started planting vegetables, he said.The area came under siege, so his family moved again, living in a cave for a few months and then in the abandoned home of another family who had fled the country.When the fighting reached there, too, the family members moved to a camp on the Syrian side of the Turkish border, where they survived on money sent by Mr. Abdul-Qader\u2019s brother, who works in Lebanon.\u201cThe aid coming to the camp is rare, but we are still alive,\u201d he said by phone.Life has become hard even in areas that are not directly threatened by violence.Many also say the war has damaged the social order, giving armed men a leg up on everyone else.One recent evening in Damascus, hundreds of people waited in a long line in the street to buy their government-set allotment of eight loaves of flatbread from a bakery when armed men from a pro-government militia pounded on the door.\u201cI am security!\u201d one yelled. \u201cOpen it, or I will destroy it!\u201dThe men left soon after, their arms full of bags of bread.Hopes that the situation would improve rose briefly a year ago when the United Nations Security Council passed its first resolution on Syria, calling for free access to humanitarian aid. Another resolution authorized aid shipments across borders not controlled by the Syrian government.\u201cThere is more death, more displacement, an increase in restrictions by neighboring countries and a more desperate situation for the refugees and for those displaced inside Syria,\u201d said Daniel Gorevan, who handles Syria policy for Oxfam, one of the groups that participated in the report.In countries bordering Syria, the flood of refugees has put a heavy burden on economies and budgets. In Lebanon, where about one in five residents is a refugee, some communities have been transformed by the human tide.Since the conflict started, the Lebanese town of Sadnayel has seen its prewar population of about 15,000 more than double as refugees have arrived, said Raed Sawan, the vice president of the City Council.\u201cIt\u2019s all crowded and filthy,\u201d he said, driving through town and pointing to the tent camps that had sprouted all around. \u201cIt\u2019s a miserable life.\u201dThe town could barely keep up with the new arrivals, he said, and the municipal budget could not cover trash collection or other services. Most of the camps had not been connected to the sewer system, and their outhouses emptied into pools of green water in nearby irrigation ditches.On the edge of town, hundreds of refugees were staying in an old cow shed that had been divided into small rooms.

Lane and Bonnie Comley haven\u2019t minded the harsh winter.Spring and summer, however, are the better seasons on the 800-square-foot terrace overlooking the Italian Renaissance Revival dome of the Church of St. Jean Baptiste.Those purchases made in 2010 include a Tiffany-style ceiling fixture in their library-cum-living room and a kaleidoscopic backlit wall panel in the ornate dining room.Mr. Lane\u2019s most prized collection is the autographed photographs of the showmen George M. Cohan, Irving Berlin and P. T.

{"Headline": "Quiet Start to Central Bank Bond-Buying Program for the Eurozone", "Date": "2015-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite predictions that the central bank would have trouble finding enough government bonds to buy, officials in Frankfurt said they were not encountering any problems \u2014 at least on the first day of purchases.European stock markets slipped slightly for the day, while the euro rose initially against the dollar before retreating to about $1.085. The effective interest rate or yield on German 10-year bonds fell to 0.31 percent from 0.39 percent, though it was not clear if the central bank\u2019s buying was the main reason. Bond yields fall as prices rise.\u201cE.C.B. and eurosystem national central banks have, as previously announced, started purchases under the Public Sector Purchase Program,\u201d the central bank said on Twitter.The eurosystem refers to the network of eurozone national central banks, which are doing most of the purchasing on bond markets. Typically they are buying the bonds from large banks that act as dealers.The goal of the program is to drive up inflation, which has slipped into negative territory and has raised the specter of deflation, a broad decline in consumer prices that can eventually undercut corporate revenue and force companies to cut staff.Central banks in the United States, Britain and Japan have used quantitative easing, but it had never been tried in the eurozone until Monday.The European Central Bank has said bonds will be purchased on the open market \u2014 not directly from bond issuers, in part to avoid accusations that it is violating a ban on central bank financing of eurozone governments. And it will wait several days before buying newly issued bonds to give financial markets time to determine a price.But one side effect of the program could be to relieve pressure on government budgets. Most of the purchases are being conducted by national central banks, which will buy their own governments\u2019 bonds and collect interest payments and other profits.Later, the central banks will pass the profits back to their national governments. That means the debt effectively becomes free of cost to the issuing country.One unresolved issue is how to deal with any losses suffered in countries like Germany, where many government bonds with maturities of seven years or less carry negative interest rates and thus will return less money than they cost. Opposition to the bond-buying program remains fierce in Germany.\u201cThe bond purchase program will make the problems in Europe even worse,\u201d L\u00fcder Gerken, director of the Center for European Policy in Freiburg, Germany, said in a statement. \u201cBy lowering interest rates on government bonds the E.C.B. will further remove reform pressure on member states. At the same time the flood of money will lead to false allocation of capital and strongly raise the risk of bubbles.\u201dThe European Central Bank aims to buy \u20ac60 billion ($65 billion) in government bonds and other assets each month, spread out evenly over the month. The purchases will continue until September 2016, or until the bank\u2019s Governing Council is confident that inflation is heading back toward the official target of below, but close to, 2 percent.Much of the effect of the central bank\u2019s policies was already reflected in the rising prices of stocks and bonds. The central bank said in January that it would begin buying government bonds, and it had signaled well before then that quantitative easing was imminent.Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a member of the central bank\u2019s executive board, said in an interview on Sunday with Politis, a newspaper in Cyprus, that the asset-purchase program had already had a positive effect on the eurozone economy, by pushing down the cost of credit.\u201cLending rates to households and firms have come down since the summer across the entire euro area,\u201d Mr. Coeur\u00e9 said in the interview.The purchases are being made roughly in proportion to the economic weight of each of the 19 countries in the eurozone.In addition to bonds issued by governments, the European Central Bank and national central banks will also buy debt issued by government institutions such as the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone bailout fund, and the Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, a German development bank.The European Central Bank said it would disclose details of the bond purchases on a weekly basis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Venezuela\u2019s Currency Circus", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsIn a faraway land, an eccentric king nailed an edict to the door of his palace that said: \u201cHenceforth, $20 bills will be sold here for $1.\u201dWithin minutes, his subjects were clamoring for those cut-rate twenties. So the king posted a second edict: \u201cEach $20 bill shall be used only to buy things abroad.\u201d Then a third: \u201cWhatever you buy abroad with your $20 you must sell in our kingdom for $2.\u201d\u201cThis will make me beloved!\u201d he thought. \u201cForeign goods will be cheap for all.\u201dBut it didn\u2019t work out that way. Soon, the lines for $20 bills were matched by lines at every store that sold foreign goods.Since nobody saw much point in buying anything abroad to sell for just $2, people mostly pocketed the twenties and the imports never showed up on store shelves. And if any item did hit the shelves, whether it was a $2 box of diapers or a $2 sack of flour, it could be sold for $6 on the black market \u2014 so standing in line at the shops became a job.The king was incensed. A new edict appeared: \u201cPocketing your twenty and marking up a $2 import are henceforth economic crimes, punishable by imprisonment.\u201dRiot police officers roamed the queues sniffing out dissent; subjects were recruited as spies. \u201cIt must be a conspiracy! A foreign plot to overthrow the monarchy,\u201d raged the king.If this fable strikes you as far-fetched, spare a thought for the people of Venezuela. For 12 years, their economy has been run pretty much along these lines.The system gives rise to a mind-bending tangle of economic distortions. By one calculation, with a single $100 bill exchanged at the black market rate, you can buy enough subsidized gasoline in Venezuela to drive a Hummer around the world 28 times. A new Toyota Corolla retails for about 1.9 million bol\u00edvars \u2014 that\u2019s either about $300,000 (at one exchange rate) or around $7,200 (at another), take your pick. As in our fable, the exchange-rate regime creates huge incentives for importers to pocket their cheap dollars rather than bring in goods \u2014 and that gives rise to lines. Long lines. For all the basics.What\u2019s strange is that Venezuela\u2019s chaos is entirely self-inflicted. Unlike Greece, which simply doesn\u2019t have the money to pay its debts, the solution to Venezuela\u2019s disaster is a desk reform well within President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s power: Just stop handing out twenties for a buck.But Distortioland is not normal. The currency regime offers nothing to consumers facing empty shelves, so devaluation could prove popular, even in the short run. Venezuela, between a rock and a lounge chair, has thrown itself against the rock.So why doesn\u2019t Mr. Maduro take action? Maybe because those people pocketing twenties are friends of the government. Or because the Maduro administration just doesn\u2019t understand the economic consequences of walking back its earlier mistakes (shockingly, there\u2019s not a single economist in Venezuela\u2019s cabinet). In any case, it\u2019s not happening.What\u2019s happening instead is that the multiple exchange rate system is spawning police-state actions. As discontent mounts, a government at wits\u2019 end is turning paranoid \u2014 pouncing on even the mildest expressions of dissent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Irish Rebellion, This Time Against Water Fees", "Date": "2015-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDUBLIN \u2014 Miranda Lumsden, 43, a single mother of four, had never protested against anything before the Irish government introduced new water fees last summer.But the prospect of yet another bill arriving in the mail made her angry enough to join a cluster of demonstrators outside Dublin\u2019s City Hall recently, even as sleet turned their homemade \u201cWe Won\u2019t Pay\u201d posters soggy.\u201cI\u2019m scrimping from week to week as it is,\u201d said Ms. Lumsden, pulling her jacket closer. \u201cI\u2019ve only got my bus fare home to last me the rest of the week.\u201dIn recent months, however, the Irish have been anything but quiet. The prospect of paying for water, which many see as yet another new tax at a time when the government has assured them that austerity is over, has prompted a series of mass protests across the country, from Dublin to Cork. Many demonstrators say they have no intention of paying the new fees.About a third of the country\u2019s households have simply refused to register with the newly created state authority that is to run the country\u2019s water service, though the deadline for doing so has now been extended three times. In some neighborhoods, workers trying to install meters have been met with angry mobs and forced to flee.The pushback has been so strong that the government has already lowered its sights somewhat, setting a cap on the water charges, at least for now, and adding a sweetener \u2014 100 euros, equal to about $110, for households that register.Still, some experts say that the protests are far from over, reflecting growing fatigue with austerity policies that have taken a toll on most families, even as the economy has recovered to the point that it is the fastest-growing in Europe.Many expect a widespread refusal to pay when the bills are sent out in April.\u201cIt\u2019s been like watching a dam bursting,\u201d said Paddy Prendiville, the editor of a biweekly political and current affairs magazine, The Phoenix. \u201cA defiance that wasn\u2019t there is here now. The water charges have been the final straw for people.\u201dHere, too, polls indicate that a political shift is brewing. Support has been growing for the anti-austerity left-wing opposition Sinn Fein party and for smaller parties that are, like Syriza in Greece, calling for the renegotiation of terms on loans.Sinn Fein is the political offshoot of the Irish Republican Army and is headed by Gerry Adams, who has long denied assertions that he was an I.R.A. member or took part in I.R.A. violence.Sinn Fein is polling at more than 20 percent of the vote, about level with Ireland\u2019s two traditionally dominant parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, and more than twice the votes it got in 2011. Elections must take place by April 2016, but could take place later this year, experts say.\u201cThings could get very interesting,\u201d Mr. Prendiville said. \u201cSinn Fein will surely double its seats. No one cares what the I.R.A. did 30 years ago.\u201dThe protesters say they have been paying taxes for water for years and the government is double-billing now.At first, Prime Minister Enda Kenny\u2019s administration sought to install meters and charge citizens by water use. But then the government capped charges and promised that the rates would not change until 2019. For most households, that means paying no more than $285 a year, officials said.Alan Kelly, the minister of environment, community and local government, said that creating an authority with a dedicated revenue stream that can sell bonds is the best way to finance the infrastructure work that is needed. He dismisses the protesters as \u201cleft wing\u201d or \u201cpopulists,\u201d and he recently suggested they were in \u201ccloud cuckoo land.\u201dBut Sarah Murphy, 35, who lives in Ballymun, one of the poorest areas of Dublin, said that her husband has been unable to find work since his business collapsed in 2008. The family, after paying rent and electricity, lives on $73 a week for five people, she said.\u201cWe are not paying it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have it.\u201dIreland\u2019s economy has been recovering. It grew by nearly 4.8 percent in 2014, and unemployment fell to about 10 percent from a high of 15 percent. But many experts say the figures are misleading, as the unemployed continue to leave the country and many multinational companies, based in Ireland because of its low corporate tax rate, are recording financial transactions that actually take place elsewhere.A report by the country\u2019s Central Statistics Office that was released in January painted a direr picture of what has happened in Ireland since the crisis began. The most recent figures available show that nearly a third of the population in 2013 was suffering from \u201cenforced deprivation\u201d characterized by a lack of two or more basic requirements for a comfortable standard of living, such as adequate food, heating or a warm winter coat, up from 13.7 percent in 2008, before the financial crisis and the recession. Confrontations between protesters and water meter installers have resulted in numerous arrests, with five protesters receiving what many considered hefty sentences of 28 to 56 days recently for violating a judge\u2019s order to stay more than 20 feet away from the installers before the proceedings were voided on a technicality.One Socialist Party member of Parliament, Paul Murphy, who was elected in a by-election last October on a pledge of abolishing the water charges, was also arrested, accused of having a role in a protest last November that trapped the deputy prime minister and leader of the Labor Party, Joan Burton, in her car for hours.The police did not arrive at Mr. Murphy\u2019s house until Feb. 9 around 7 a.m., prompting members of his party to suggest that the arrest was more about damaging the movement against water charges than anything else.Mr. Murphy, still in his pajamas when the police arrived, was given time to get dressed before spending more than eight hours at the police station answering questions. He said he had no idea whether the case against him would proceed.He said he believes that even households that have registered, many because they were eager to get the \u20ac100, will not be paying their bills.Refusal to pay could bring the project to its knees, Mr. Murphy said. The government cannot automatically take the water charges from people\u2019s paychecks, as it can with a tax, though officials have said that those who do not pay could face late charges.\u201cA lot of people now see the bailouts of the banks as an ongoing crime,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cThere is a real sense out there of \u2018O.K., is there going to be any recovery for us?\u2019\u00a0\u201dDouglas Dalby contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Thrift,\u2019 by Andrew L. Yarrow", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.National Thrift Week, originally organized by the Y.M.C.A. in 1917, was the signature event of a nationwide moral crusade by elites to mold Americans\u2019 behaviors. During seven days centered on Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Jan.\u00a017 birthday, thrift advocates taught people how to open savings accounts, buy insurance, purchase homes, pay bills promptly and share with others. By the early 1920s, Thrift Week was observed by more than a thousand cities in the United States, and still more around the globe. Thrift was put forward as the antidote to many of the nation\u2019s perceived ills: working-class radicalism, urban poverty, squandering of natural resources and excessive consumerism.Andrew L. Yarrow, a former New York Times reporter and currently an affiliate scholar at the Institute for American Values, argues for the importance of this now forgotten chapter in American history. The thrift movement was large, and reached deep into mainstream America. It also attracted an impressive range of participants, from financiers to temperance supporters, religious leaders, progressives, trade unionists, presidents and civil rights activists. Thrift meant more than mere saving. It was a larger philosophy of moderation, righteous living, hard work, self-control, responsibility to others and frugal husbanding of all resources, including nature. Yarrow\u2019s account combines numerous quotes from the prescriptive literature on thrift with an accounting of the movement\u2019s many activities. These included thrift education in schools, conferences, publications, parades and the promotion of savings strategies. In the first decade of the 20th century, the impetus was moral reform aimed at the working class; in the 1910s, a patriotic appeal to save for the war effort; and in the 1920s, a largely commercial thrust to encourage saving in private banks as well as credit unions and building and loan associations. A frustrating aspect of the book is that there is little effort to get beyond the voluminous prescriptive material produced by thrift advocates. Drawing more on letters, diaries or newspaper accounts would have given insight into these advocates\u2019 motivations as well as any alliances and conflicts within their ranks. The reader is also left wondering about the impact on ordinary Americans. We learn that children began to put pennies in piggy banks and parents opened savings accounts. What did these activities mean to them? Because the movement was so diverse, the concept of thrift was something of a Rorschach inkblot. Who saw what in it?After the stock market crash of 1929, the thrift movement collapsed almost as quickly as the economy. While Yarrow describes this demise in broad strokes, more analysis might have helped address how discourses of thrift related to consumerism. The pre-Depression heyday of thrift was also a heyday for retailing, advertising and consumer acquisition. Was thrift advocacy an enabler, paying lip service to ways of living that consumerism was eroding \u2014 acting, in effect, as a performance with little substance? Was it truly an oppositional movement that was attempting to resist the onslaught of getting and spending? Or did it become, in its later incarnation, mostly an adjunct of banking interests?In the final chapter, Yarrow argues that a contemporary revival of the thrift movement could address America\u2019s many social and economic troubles, providing a bridge between conservatives and progressives. I doubt this chapter will persuade those who aren\u2019t already uncomfortable with deficit spending and household debt. His argument ignores the damage that the moralization of economic behavior has wrought, both during the 1930s and the 2010s. Keynesianism is reduced to a mere \u201cnostrum.\u201d But more damning, I suspect, is that even in its heyday, thrift advocacy appears not to have been very effective, either at solving problems of poverty and so-called moral degeneracy or at stemming the juggernaut of consumerism.

{"Headline": "A Crusader Against the Common View of the Financial Crisis", "Date": "2015-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreet ScenePeter J. Wallison, the 73-year-old conservative Republican, former White House counsel under President Ronald Reagan and current fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, is determined to change the understanding of the cause of the 2008 financial crisis. It\u2019s an uphill battle.He thinks that big banks have been receiving far too much of the blame and that government housing policies, dating back 25 years, not nearly enough of it. Worse, Mr. Wallison says, the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, which emerged in the wake of the crisis to re-regulate Wall Street, is not only \u201coppressive\u201d but it has also thwarted economic growth by curbing the willingness of banks, both large and small, to make the loans that are crucial to keeping American businesses vibrant.He contends the true story is not being told for the usual reasons: No one in government has stepped up to take responsibility for poor decisions. It\u2019s easier and more fun to blame the big banks that are not in a position to defend themselves because they are regulated by those that are really to blame. And the media has missed the boat on what happened.\u201cEverything I see leads me to believe that unless the American people get a whole re-education on this, they are going to continue to believe forever that the financial crisis was caused by the greedy Wall Street banks in the private sector,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t make any connection to government policy.\u201dIn summary, his argument is that the government housing policies, promulgated by both the executive and legislative branches from the early days of the Clinton administration to the present \u2014 with a brief respite at the height of the crisis \u2014 encouraged the private sector to make home mortgages of increasingly deteriorating credit quality to people who could not afford them. Officials then encouraged both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the large, quasi-government housing enterprises, to buy those mortgages, package them and sell them as securities to investors worldwide.Because of these faulty government policies, he said, it \u201cbecame very sensible\u201d for banks to either make or to buy mortgages and sell them to Fannie and Freddie to feed their insatiable appetite for them. Of course, Wall Street deserves its share of the blame for this, Mr. Wallison concedes, but the government deserves more of it.The trouble, Mr. Wallison contends, started in 1992, when Congress passed \u201caffordable housing goals\u201d that instructed Fannie and Freddie, when buying mortgages from banks and other originators, to ensure that at least 30 percent of the purchased mortgages be made to people either at or below the median income level of the communities in which they lived. As a result, he argues, underwriting standards deteriorated drastically and Fannie and Freddie started larding up their balance sheets with subprime mortgages. Banks and other originators reacted to the new goals by supplying the subprime mortgages the government wanted.He contends the underwriting standards deteriorated further after Andrew M. Cuomo, Mr. Clinton\u2019s secretary of Housing and Urban Development and now the governor of New York, increased to 50 percent the target for mortgages bought being made to people at or below the median income in their communities.\u201cH.U.D. was given the authority to not only set the goals, but also to determine what the goals should be,\u201d Mr. Wallison said. By 2008, he said, some 56 percent of the mortgages that Fannie and Freddie were buying were subprime and others of low quality. The two companies did not protest these mandates, he said, because they were afraid of stepped-up regulation from the George W. Bush administration.The idea, of course, was to increase homeownership in America, one of the cornerstones of the American dream and one that both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush trumpeted. The tactic worked. As a result of the government policies, at the time of the crisis, homeownership had increased to about 70 percent of American families, from a longstanding level of about 64 percent. Millions of renters had been given a free option on homeownership and took it.\u201cYou can create a kind of a bubble in the economy,\u201d Mr. Wallison said. \u201cThings look pretty good for a while. And then you hope you\u2019re out of office when the music stops.\u201dTrying to correct the record as he sees it is not a new passion for Mr. Wallison. In fact, he\u2019s been at it since he famously wrote a 99-page dissent to the voluminous 2011 report on the causes of the crisis by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, led by Phil Angelides, a liberal Democrat and the former California treasurer. It still rankles him that lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, kick and scream when Wall Street tries to water down the regulatory provisions of the Dodd-Frank law, as they have been doing for years, and claim that the safety of the financial system is being undermined.\u201cWhy does she get so much attention for that?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause people generally believe that the Dodd-Frank Act was adopted to protect us against the kinds of deprivations that Wall Street created.\u201d He thinks Wall Street is right to try to continue to gut the Dodd-Frank provisions to get the economy roaring again.Mr. Wallison knows he has a tough sell on his hands and that it could take years to sway public opinion. He compares his lonely quest to that undertaken by the economist Milton Friedman, who in the 1960s \u2014 nearly 40 years after the fact \u2014 was able to change people\u2019s beliefs about the cause the Great Depression: to the Federal Reserve\u2019s too-tight monetary policy from too much competition among companies.\u201cMaybe 20 years from now, people will have read this book,\u201d he said, \u201cand enough people will have said, \u2018Maybe what happened in 2008 wasn\u2019t really the banks, but it was actually government housing policy. Maybe we ought to change the policy.\u2019\u201dHe doesn\u2019t seem all that optimistic this will happen anytime soon. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll take another financial crisis based on the same policies for people to start thinking,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this column and a picture caption with it misstated the number of dissenters to the report by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. While Peter J. Wallison did write a 99-page dissent, three other Republicans joined in a separate one; he was not the lone dissenter.William D. Cohan is a former senior mergers and acquisitions banker who has written three books about Wall Street. His latest book is \u201cThe Price of Silence: The Duke Lacrosse Scandal, the Power of the Elite, and the Corruption of Our Great Universities.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Prediction Market for Inflation, or Deflation", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewSomething unusual is happening to prices right now: They are falling. The recent sharp decline in gas prices is part of the story, but there is now growing fear that the Federal Reserve will undershoot its own 2 percent inflation target, hindering the economic recovery. There\u2019s also a small but worrying risk that the economy could enter a deflationary rut.At issue are inflation expectations. Economists believe expectations are critical because they shape the decisions individual shopkeepers make when deciding whether and by how much to raise their prices. Beliefs about inflation create a self-fulfilling prophecy in which today\u2019s expected inflation becomes tomorrow\u2019s actual inflation. The trick to managing inflation then, is to manage inflation expectations. In practice, though, it is very hard to observe what people expect inflation to be.That\u2019s why it\u2019s worth paying close attention to the disturbing portents from a relatively young and obscure derivatives market that provides new perspectives on inflation expectations \u2014 tracking not only the likely level of inflation, but also the risks that inflation might be too high, too low or just right. In this market, derivatives called inflation caps and inflation floors are, effectively, bets on the trajectory of prices over the next few years.Think of it as a prediction market for inflation. Just as prediction markets are better than experts, computer models or surveys at forecasting elections, sporting events and the weather, it seems likely that these markets are better at capturing inflation expectations.For example, the two economists show that by buying and selling various derivatives you can form a portfolio expected to pay $100 if the average rate of inflation over the next five years is between 1.5 and 2.5 percent. At the moment, this bet sells for $49. If traders are betting to maximize their expected profits (more on this in a moment), then this price will rise or fall until it reflects the probability of that level of inflation. The $49 price suggests the market believes there\u2019s slightly less than a 50-50 chance that the Fed will deliver an outcome that is roughly consistent with its stated inflation target of 2 percent.While traders view inflation of roughly 2 percent as the most likely outcome, the market is also telling us the probability of other levels of inflation \u2014 or deflation. And it is saying that the risks of missing the 2 percent target are extremely unbalanced: It is twice as likely that inflation will come in below the Fed\u2019s target as above it.Moreover, for a technical reason, these odds most likely understate the probability that the Fed will undershoot its inflation target. (That\u2019s because the derivatives are bets on the future of the Consumer Price Index, while the Fed\u2019s goal is tied to a different index, for personal consumption expenditures, and it tends to grow a few tenths of a percentage point slower.)The prediction market also highlights the risks of the type of really awful outcomes that keep economists up at night.Consider the threat of deflation, in which prices fall over an extended period, often hand in hand with economic stagnation. The market currently gives a 6 to 7 percent chance that prices will either be flat or will fall over the next five years. This sort of prolonged deflationary slump \u2014 similar to one Japan has experienced \u2014 would probably spell bad news for the United States. While the market is not saying this outcome is likely \u2014 indeed, it has revised down the odds a bit in recent weeks \u2014 it does suggest it is worth worrying about.Of course, the specific probabilities inferred from market prices should be taken with many grains of salt. In particular, traders may not be betting that prolonged deflation is probable, but rather be buying insurance against such a grim occurrence. Thus, prediction market prices might overstate the probability of bad outcomes. Nonetheless, these prices embed a powerful message for policy makers: Just as people buy flood insurance when they\u2019re concerned that a storm might do terrible damage, traders might be buying deflation insurance because they fear the risk of vast economic damage if the economy were to enter a deflationary rut.A common concern voiced by the Fed\u2019s hard-money critics is that the central bank has already increased the money supply so much that it will lose control of inflation as the economy recovers. The market does not give much stock to these concerns, however, suggesting that there\u2019s only a 1 percent chance that inflation will average 5 percent or more over the next five years. Next time people tell you that higher inflation is coming, remind them that they can get rich in the derivatives markets if they\u2019re willing to put their money where their mouth is.For several years now, these markets \u2014 as well as related inflation-indexed bonds and inflation swaps \u2014 have been a source of comfort for policy makers, as they reported that inflation expectations were roughly consistent with the Fed\u2019s inflation target. But over the last half-year, the markets have sounded a largely unheralded alert siren, reporting that expected inflation has fallen sharply. Inflation is now expected to run half a point or more below target for many years.To some extent, this decline in inflation expectations reflects a vote of confidence in the Fed, as earlier fears of high inflation have come to be seen as an increasingly distant possibility. But it also reflects fears of Fed timidity, as the risk of prolonged deflation remains high.By this measure, the Fed has been halfway successful at establishing its credibility, successfully bolstering its inflation-fighting bona fides, but failing to instill sufficient confidence that it stands ready to fight the drag of very low inflation or outright deflation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Atlanta, a Quest to Keep Its Airport the World\u2019s Busiest", "Date": "2015-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesATLANTA \u2014 The typical flier might wonder why an airport would promote its designation as the world\u2019s busiest. Images of long lines, crowded concourses and auxiliary parking lots in the next area code could be evoked.And it is why some of those authorities took notice recently that Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International surpassed Hartsfield-Jackson in one measurement of an airport\u2019s activity: takeoffs and landings.Soon after, Atlanta\u2019s mayor, Kasim Reed, announced that he was gathering a dozen marketing experts from prominent local firms and civic organizations to figure out how to keep its airport \u2014 and the area\u2019s fiscal fitness \u2014 thriving.\u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re not sitting on our laurels,\u201d Mayor Reed said. \u201cCandidly, we were failing to aggressively promote the city to passengers passing through.\u201dIndeed, growth in the airport\u2019s traffic, after decades of steadily climbing, has leveled off in the last decade and is barely increasing.While the idea of a committee was conceived well before the latest passenger and operations statistics were disclosed, Mayor Reed said that one goal was to maximize flier volume. The thinking is, as more knowledge about the city is shared to the airport\u2019s clientele, more jobs in the surrounding area ultimately could be created.Richard K. Green, a business and public policy professor at the University of Southern California, sees a correlation between busy airports and faster gains in jobs and population.\u201cWhile it is very difficult to separate cause from effect, in my view there is stronger evidence than not that a busy airport leads to growth,\u201d he said.The belief is that spreading awareness entices businesses, especially those based overseas, to relocate or expand in Atlanta, which happens to own and run the airport.To Jeffrey A. Rosensweig, associate professor of international business and finance at Emory University in Atlanta, a booming airport\u2019s role in robust areas that it serves cannot be underestimated.\u201cAn airport can wield tremendous impact on the economic health of its city and its whole region. I believe that the global economy is pivoting around major hubs for trade and finance. World-class transportation facilities are a key to becoming a hub,\u201d he said, citing Dallas and Denver as examples in the United States.The two cities \u201cinvested massive dollars in huge new airports and they have helped jobs and real estate boom in their regions,\u201d he added.No city-airport tandem has prospered in lock step like Atlanta and Hartsfield-Jackson.\u201cThe airport has been almost uniquely crucial to the rapid and sustained development of metro Atlanta and, frankly, of Georgia,\u201d Mr. Rosensweig said. He suggested that Hartsfield-Jackson deserved credit in luring a wide range of entities, including automobile factories and prominent corporate headquarters like United Parcel Service and Porsche, and the 1996 Summer Olympics.Civic leaders have long envisioned the airport as a major component in helping to advance the area\u2019s growth. In 1961, well before Atlanta was a primary population center, the largest single terminal in the country was christened. It was followed 19 years later by what was then the world\u2019s biggest passenger terminal complex.One reason to focus on raising passenger numbers is that some airlines already with a presence will increase routes and those without a foothold will enter the market. Hartsfield-Jackson craves more direct international flights that are particularly appealing to foreign business leaders who might establish a presence in the region.\u201cYou have to look at an airport not only as a passenger depot, but as driving additional jobs and economic development,\u201d said Miguel Southwell, the airport\u2019s general manager of aviation.The Chicago airport leapfrogged Hartsfield-Atlanta for operations \u2014 or, in aviation parlance, movements. O\u2019Hare, which had ceded the distinction to its southern rival in 2005 and trailed ever since, recorded nearly 882,000, compared with some 868,000 in Atlanta.While some news reports, mainly in Chicago, declared O\u2019Hare as the world\u2019s busiest, the airport refrained from wagging a foam No. 1 finger and declined to comment about vaulting ahead in operations.For its part, Hartsfield-Jackson pointed out in a news release that passenger count is the metric for world\u2019s busiest that is most recognized by the industry.Mr. Southwell took a subtle dig at O\u2019Hare, saying in an interview, that Atlanta was not concerned that Chicago moves millions fewer passengers than Hartsfield-Jackson does \u201cwhile using more aircraft.\u201dMr. Reed is equally unrestrained with making the \u201cworld\u2019s busiest\u201d boast. Like Mr. Southwell, he maintains that it carries discernible benefits.\u201cI definitely think so,\u201d said the mayor, noting how chief executives of major companies that have dropped anchor in the area have mentioned the ranking. About 1,500 German firms alone have metropolitan Atlanta mailing addresses.But some aviation officials are skeptical that the world\u2019s busiest crown bears direct fruit on its own.\u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating story,\u201d said Rafael Echevarne, director of economics at Airports Council International World, a global trade representative. \u201cNonetheless, there are no tangible benefits to being the world\u2019s busiest airport \u2014 whether from a passenger traffic or aircraft movement perspective \u2014 other than the recognition received.\u201dAnd no matter the efforts of Atlanta officials, the title may not last long. Dubai, currently the world\u2019s busiest international hub, is growing fast and, more immediately, the surging Beijing Capital International is about 10 million passengers a year behind, with the gap steadily narrowing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Dollar Heats Up Overseas, U.S. Manufacturers Feel a Chill", "Date": "2015-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe dollar\u2019s sharp rise in recent months has left Robert Stevenson and Eastman Machine, his family\u2019s 127-year-old Buffalo company, feeling the heat on both sides of the Atlantic.Confronted with a steep drop in the value of the euro against the dollar, customers in Europe warn that they can no longer afford to buy Eastman\u2019s American-made cutting equipment without deep discounts. Buyers in America, meanwhile, are demanding lower prices from Mr. Stevenson, too, as European-based rivals take advantage of the suddenly stronger dollar, which allows them to reduce prices on the machines they export to the United States without squeezing profits.In both cases, Mr. Stevenson has been forced to compromise, cutting prices and sacrificing profit margins to avoid losing business. \u201cWe are hardly making money, but we need to keep these customers and keep our factory going,\u201d he said. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have happened a couple of years ago.\u201dIndeed, the sharp rise of the dollar threatens to undercut one of the principal drivers of the recovery in recent years: strong export growth for American companies.On Tuesday, McCormick & Company, the spice producer, said the robust dollar would hurt results in the months ahead; other well-known American companies like Tiffany and Oracle made similar pronouncements last week. More warnings are expected as companies begin to report earnings for the first quarter of 2015, which ends on Tuesday.Globally, the dollar\u2019s strength means American-made products \u2014 unless their manufacturers adjust prices \u2014 effectively cost about 15 to 20 percent more to foreign consumers than they did a year ago. Few economists expect the dollar to reverse course anytime soon; many expect the euro and the dollar to reach parity in the coming months for the first time since 2003.Currency swings, though, can serve as a get-out-of-jail-free excuse for executives when their company\u2019s numbers fall short of Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\u201cEvery company out there will blame the dollar in some way, shape or form, but there is a reason for that,\u201d said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. \u201cCurrencies are the hardest thing in the world to figure out because there are so many moving parts.\u201dThe exact causes vary from country to country, but in most cases the dollar is surging because the United States remains an island of relative strength in the global economy. Another important contributing factor is the expectation that the Fed will increase interest rates later this year, even as the European Central Bank is keeping them low in a bid to stimulate the long-dormant economy there.That anticipated gap in future yields, along with a desire among global investors for a safe harbor as tumult continues in Russia and the Middle East, is drawing cash from overseas into dollar-denominated investments, pushing the value of the dollar higher.There are economic benefits, as well as costs, from this shift. Imported goods are cheaper for American consumers, limiting the threat of inflation and potentially giving the Fed more time before a rate rise kicks in. Similarly, travel abroad is becoming more affordable for American tourists.Still, for businesses that depend on sales overseas, and executives like Mr. Stevenson, the dollar\u2019s surge has meant both resignation and adaptation.In Eastman Machine\u2019s case, it has meant cutting costs wherever possible, importing more of the components that go into the products that Eastman\u2019s 125 workers in Buffalo assemble instead of sourcing them domestically, and moving some production to the company\u2019s other factory, near Shanghai.\u201cWe are shopping more overseas,\u201d Mr. Stevenson said. \u201cWe\u2019re a microcosm of what\u2019s happening at a lot of U.S. companies. It costs the U.S. jobs, but we\u2019d be foolish not to.\u201dFor example, Mr. Stevenson is planning to buy a new control system for his factory that is made in Germany rather than the United States. With a price of several hundred thousand dollars, the currency savings are substantial.And while the machines Eastman sells in the United States and Europe will continue to be made in Buffalo, Mr. Stevenson said, he is shifting production aimed at the fast-growing Indian market to China to gain an edge in pricing.\u201cI\u2019m not losing so much business,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is hurting American jobs and profit margins.\u201d Were it not for the price pressure from European customers and the need to produce more of his products in China to sell to India, he figured, Eastman would employ 10 to 20 more workers in Buffalo than it currently does.\u201cThis has nothing to do with the wage scale,\u201d Mr. Stevenson added. \u201cWe\u2019re very competitive in terms of productivity. But the Indian market is taking off and we are being forced to manufacture outside of the U.S. to stay competitive there.\u201dAlthough the weaker euro tends to dominate the headlines when it comes to the dollar\u2019s rise, the decline of other currencies poses similar risks for many American companies.Briggs & Stratton, a publicly traded Milwaukee firm whose products include gasoline engines for outdoor power equipment, as well as Snapper lawn mowers and Simplicity tractors, has raised prices a bit in Australia and Brazil as the dollar has climbed, but it fears losing market share as a result, as do other manufacturers.\u201cWe have implemented price increases, but it comes down to competition,\u201d said Todd J. Teske, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cAt what point does demand suffer because of price? I\u2019m concerned that these currencies will continue to weaken against the dollar.\u201dOnly about 30 percent of Briggs & Stratton\u2019s sales come from overseas. So for now, the American market is still where the action is.For much bigger American companies that look abroad for a majority of sales, like Boeing and United Technologies, the threat of a surging dollar might seem greater, but their size and global footprint actually make adaptation somewhat easier.In Boeing\u2019s case, executives said, the huge lead time between orders and delivery in the aviation industry reduces the impact currency swings have on sales. The aircraft market is also priced in dollars for customers globally, further limiting the effect of currency moves.United Technologies, which makes everything from Carrier air-conditioners to Otis elevators, tends to locate production close to customers wherever possible. So elevators for the Chinese market are built there while workers in Europe are paid in euros to make air-conditioners that are sold in euros, insulating the company from some of the impact.Still, sales and profits overseas are converted into dollars to calculate financial results each quarter, so United Technologies has been forced to bring down its estimates for 2015 revenue and earnings.With more volatility expected in the currency markets in the months ahead, many executives admit they have little control over such global economic shifts.\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy in the short term to move production one way or another, even though we have factories all over the world,\u201d said John Selldorff, who runs the North American operations of Legrand, a global manufacturer of electrical and data products based in France.Some companies employ complex hedging strategies using futures and other financial instruments. But that has costs of its own, Mr. Selldorff cautions, adding that he would rather make bets on what he knows \u2014 electrical equipment \u2014 than on the dollar\u2019s next move.\u201cIn the dozen-plus years I\u2019ve worked here, this stuff ebbs and flows,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are trends that you just have to work around.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Assignment America: Selma", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "Fifty years after the police viciously attacked hundreds of marchers in a pivotal moment of the civil rights movement, Selma, Ala., defies neat story lines.Supported byThis series will explore changes in American politics, culture and technology, drawing on the reporting and personal experiences of New York Times journalists around the country.He explained that he and a few of his friends were assisting Steavie in a city-sponsored endeavor to beautify Selma\u2019s downtown area. \u201cWe only had eight days to do the job,\u201d he said, conceding that lining the sidewalks with flowers and bushes in a city of limited resources and many vacant storefronts was a lot to ask of Steavie\u2019s landscaping enterprise.During my four-block stroll along Broad Street from City Hall down to the bridge ramp, I counted 15 unoccupied locations.Steavie\u2019s brother was 59, stood 5-foot-7 and was born in Selma. He was wearing a blue baseball cap with \u201cObama\u201d printed above the visor, and under his plaid flannel jacket he had on a gray hoodie, bluejeans and brown leather boots. As he spoke, he exhibited a broad smile that added length to the thin mustache on his upper lip.\u201cI\u2019m Ricky Brown,\u201d he finally said, as if ready to be candid. \u201cWhen Bloody Sunday happened, I was 9. My mother was too frightened to let me join the march, although my older sister, who was 15, was allowed to go. When the state troopers and Sheriff Jim Clark\u2019s posse began beating everybody up near the bridge, I didn\u2019t hear the noise because we lived back in the Carver projects across from Brown Chapel, where Dr. King had preached and the march had started out.\u201cBut later, I heard my sister come running home, screaming because she\u2019d been attacked by tear gas, and then all of Clark\u2019s posse came barging through our area hitting people with clubs, knocking down everybody they could reach.\u201cI was watching from the second floor of where we lived, and I had this BB gun and I\u2019m shooting at the posse\u2019s horses. I think I got off nine shots, and hit lots of horses in the ass. I\u2019m standing between two of my friends at the window while I\u2019m shooting down, and then one of the posse men sees me and yells to another posse man, \u2018Hey, those nigger kids are shooting my horse with a BB gun.\u2019 \u2018Which one?\u2019 the other guy asks. \u2018Hell, I don\u2019t know. Them niggers all look alike.\u2019 \u201dFrom there, it\u2019s been a long journey that took Mr. Brown to Detroit, where he got a job working at a Chevrolet gear and axle plant until management decided that robots could do the job better, and then a longtime position as a unionized roofer. Now he\u2019s back in Selma. \u201cI hope that the planting we did around here this week makes things seem a little more attractive to most Jubilee visitors like you,\u201d he said.Selma, perched on a high bluff on the north bank of the Alabama River, takes its name from Ossian\u2019s \u201cThe Song of Selma,\u201d which was said to be an 18th-century translation of an epic cycle of Scottish poems from the early Dark Ages but was in fact a lumpy stew of legend and folklore that came to be viewed instead as a literary fraud. And Selma today is a place expected to carry perhaps more symbolic weight than any small city can bear.Without doubt, civil rights history \u2014 American history \u2014 was made here. But I grew up in Ocean City, N.J., a politically and socially conservative island resort founded during the 1800s by Methodist ministers. Although black students attended school with whites in my hometown, it was otherwise a largely segregated community. At the boardwalk\u2019s Village Theater, black students and blacks of all ages sat by themselves in the balcony while whites gathered below in the orchestra. I recall seeing groups of white-sheeted Klansmen holding meetings occasionally on our campgrounds, within a few blocks of the business district, where my Italian-born Catholic father owned and operated a tailor shop. When I first became part of the University of Alabama\u2019s all-white campus in 1949, I saw nothing so different from what I had observed during my New Jersey boyhood.In June of 1963, as a reporter at The Times, I had an interview in New York with Alabama\u2019s Gov. George C. Wallace, who had flown in to appear on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d He stayed in a large suite at the Pierre hotel on Fifth Avenue, where our talk took place.The interview had been going well for the first 10 minutes, but then Governor Wallace suddenly rose from his chair, took me by the arm, and led me to one of the windows overlooking Central Park and the row of expensive buildings that line Fifth Avenue.\u201cHere we have the citadel of hypocrisy in America,\u201d he said, pointing down to the street and declaring that hardly any black people, even those who could afford it, could hope to share living space with whites in this area, or in surrounding areas, because of the longstanding, if unacknowledged, practices of real estate segregation in New York and other Northern cities.And still, he went on, they come down to the South and rant about equal rights!Similarly, Selma\u2019s history defies neat story lines. In 1990, I attended the interracial wedding of a 38-year-old blue-eyed, blond woman named Betty Ramsey to a 51-year-old black Selma man named Randall Miller, who owns a thriving funeral service catering overwhelmingly to blacks. He also served at the time as Selma\u2019s director of personnel under the town\u2019s enduring white mayor, Joseph T. Smitherman, who held that title in 1965 and whose simple and sympathetic manner persuaded a number of black voters to help maintain him in office for 35 years.Randall and Betty Miller live in a brick house with eight rooms and a spacious patio that is surrounded by four neatly trimmed acres of grassy land resembling the fairway of a golf course. He used to play golf regularly, but he no longer does because of the demands of his mortuary business, one of the few enterprises in a depressed economy that remain vibrant. In character with rich individuals no matter if they are black or white, he admits with reluctance to being a millionaire.\u201cMemphis doesn\u2019t celebrate the shooting\u201d of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Vardaman said, \u201cbut Selma celebrates Bloody Sunday.\u201dIt\u2019s a common refrain in a place where people want to move forward but often don\u2019t know how. The current Dallas County sheriff, Harris Huffman, is a personable 61-year-old white officer with gray hair and a goatee. He worries that too many residents, white and black, remain stuck in the past. \u201cI treat people the way I want to be treated,\u201d he said. But he added, \u201cYou\u2019ve got some people in Selma who live in the 1960s, and you\u2019ve got some that live in the 1860s.\u201dEven in 2015, it can be hard to tell what year we\u2019re in. The Selma Country Club, where I watched the members hiss at the television in 1965, still has no black members. Selma High School, about a third white during the 25th anniversary, is now all black and other students of color. There\u2019s a poster for the film \u201cSelma\u201d on display in the reception room outside the principal\u2019s office, but Selma\u2019s Walton Theater is closed.Since the film presented many scenic views of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, some in bloody splendor and some in a serene repose worthy of a tourist brochure, the town has lately been invaded by masses of camera-carrying narcissists who spend much time on the bridge taking selfies. Their numbers will surely soar this weekend as the president and perhaps thousands of out-of-town visitors, black and white, jam every square yard of highway space for a chance to re-experience history.But what you see in Selma, like most places in America, is a process still painfully working itself out. Selma\u2019s most conspicuous lightning rod is Rose Sanders, a Harvard-educated lawyer, who has long been the face of the town\u2019s civil rights movement as it still exists.Most whites in Selma accused her of destroying the public school system and instigating white flight into private schools because of a 1990s campaign she led that included sit-ins at Selma High School and boycotts of white businesses after the white-dominated school board refused to rehire the district\u2019s first black superintendent. A result was debate and acrimony among parents of both races, and the ill feeling has continued for decades without a truce.\u201cYou can\u2019t blame me for white flight,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cBlame it on the racists.\u201d She has tried to rid herself of her \u201cslave name\u201d in favor of Faya Rose Tour\u00e9, and recently she has devoted much time at the piano helping a young African-American musical group rehearse for a concert to be performed in the presence of President Obama.And still, life on the ground moves forward and backward in its own ways. The Millers look back in wonder on the world even 25 years ago, when Betty felt that neither white nor black women would accept her and Randall found himself thinking of Emmett Till, \u201cwhom they beat and took out an eye and threw in the Tallahatchie River because he had a reckless eyeball.\u201d Somehow, they\u2019ve prospered nonetheless.After our talk, we toured the patio and the grounds around their property. There was a photographer on hand, and he took a number of photographs that I hope to have printed and presented to them as a silver anniversary gift.In a few of the photos, Randall had his arms around Betty and was gently kissing her.

{"Headline": "Ukraine Arrests 2 Officials as Nation Watches on TV", "Date": "2015-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 In a carefully orchestrated spectacle calculated to dramatize a newly aggressive anticorruption campaign, the Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday arrested two senior government officials during a televised cabinet meeting in Kiev. Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, who was in the room, declared it a warning to public officials about abusing their offices or stealing from taxpayers.\u201cThis will happen to everyone who breaks the law and sneers at the Ukrainian state,\u201d Mr. Yatsenyuk told journalists who watched the arrests.The Interior Ministry later said that Mr. Bochkovsky and Mr. Stoyetsky would be charged with crimes including embezzlement and abuse of power.The Ukrainian government has long been hobbled by deep-rooted corruption and mismanagement, a source of angry, public frustration that was a factor in the street protests in Kiev last year that ousted President Viktor F. Yanukovych.But the efforts to fight corruption and hold former public officials accountable have proved to be frustratingly slow and largely ineffective, as the new government has been forced to deal first with Russia\u2019s invasion and annexation of Crimea, and then with a war waged by Russian-backed separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.In recent weeks, however, a number of steps have been taken in the government and in Parliament, including the dismissal of the country\u2019s top prosecutor.Last month, the authorities arrested a former leader of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions, Oleksandr Yefremov, on charges of abuse of power in connection with another embezzlement scheme, this one involving overpayment by the government for coal. Mr. Yefremov was released on bail. And a deputy head of the Party of Regions, Mykhailo Chechetov, who had been charged with abuse of authority, committed suicide on the night of Feb. 27 by leaping from a window of his 17th-floor apartment in Kiev. Mr. Chechetov had been under house arrest and wore an electronic monitoring bracelet. This month, the authorities in Spain arrested a former Ukrainian finance minister, Yuri Kolobov, who is accused along with other senior officials in Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government of misappropriating millions of dollars. So far, he is the only former minister to be detained, though others are being sought, including several who fled to Russia.The arrests of the two emergency services officials came hours after President Petro O. Poroshenko dismissed the billionaire governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Igor V. Kolomoisky, in a dispute that critics said reflected other murky dealings between the government and the country\u2019s richest businessmen.Mr. Kolomoisky was angry over legislation that curtailed his power over two state-controlled energy companies in which he owned a minority stake.The battle with Mr. Kolomoisky, who had been one of the government\u2019s staunchest allies, raised questions about other disputes that may unfold involving the country\u2019s so-called oligarchs, who have long found ways to benefit from the mismanagement and malfeasance in the Ukrainian government.Private militias financed by Mr. Kolomoisky had helped prevent Russian-backed separatists from advancing from Donetsk and Luhansk into the heart of Ukraine.Some prominent members of Parliament had called for Mr. Kolomoisky\u2019s removal and on Wednesday said it should be just the start of a campaign to reduce the influence of the oligarchs.The government in the meantime seemed intent on making an example of the emergency services officials, who it said had overseen a wide-scale corruption scheme in which fuel for government vehicles was purchased at inflated prices.Anton Gerashchenko, a member of Parliament who serves on a board overseeing the Interior Ministry, said that up to 20 percent of the amount spent on fuel was diverted to bank accounts of Mr. Bochkovsky and Mr. Stoyetsky in Cyprus and in Jersey, part of the Channel Islands off the coast of Normandy.\u201cSearch operations conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs over the last six months helped detect and document in detail the whole vertical of corruption led by the top leadership\u201d of the emergency services ministry, Mr. Gerashchenko said in a statement.Advertisement"}

We don\u2019t know her compensation in the new job yet, but Google can comfortably afford to match or exceed the $10.1 million in total compensation she was most recently paid at Morgan Stanley.And, of course, the weather is far better in Mountain View, Calif., than in New York.More interesting are the decisions of thousands of less famous names, promising young businesspeople and engineers who will shape the future of the American economy. And to add to the anecdotal evidence that working in Silicon Valley is the hot thing on elite college campuses, there is some solid evidence that Ms. Porat isn\u2019t the only person deciding that technology offers a more compelling opportunity than banking.There\u2019s no doubt that a lot of this is following the Willie Sutton theory of career management \u2014 go where the money is. The multibillion dollar valuations for young companies with minimal revenue would get any ambitious person\u2019s attention.But the flip side of the incredible economic opportunities in Silicon Valley is the lack of it in the more traditional get-rich career paths of Wall Street.Since the 2008 financial crisis, major global financial institutions of all stripes have been under intense pressure to pare down. Tighter capital rules mean less reliance on borrowed money, which makes stock grants less lucrative. The Volcker Rule and other restrictions on what banks can do mean there are fewer jobs for would-be masters of the universe who want to make big bets \u2014 and earn big bonuses \u2014 with their employer\u2019s money. And pension funds are becoming more wary of hedge funds that feature high fees, and high pay, with uneven returns.It\u2019s not that a smart, ambitious person can\u2019t still make a boatload of money in finance, particularly in a still surging private equity industry. It\u2019s that on the margins everything about the regulatory and economic environment is making finance look less compelling than tech industries.There\u2019s a strong argument that this is a good thing.Why does finance exist? Apart from consumer banking and managing retirement accounts and a few other areas of finance that exist to serve ordinary consumers, it exists to channel capital effectively from savers to investment. In other words, most of modern finance doesn\u2019t exist as an end in itself, but to make the rest of the economy more efficient.In that sense, to the degree the finance sector attracts the best and brightest young people, it is funneling people away from making goods and services people use, and toward serving what is essentially a back office function for the entire economy. A very important back office function, to be sure, and one that requires very smart people to do well. But a back office function nonetheless, not unlike the legal industry or human resources department or even the janitorial service that keeps your office clean.Ms. Porat and the Harvard Business School grads choosing Silicon Valley over Wall Street may be responding to the direct incentives in front of them rather than responding to that logic. But the fact that those types of moves are happening is a promising sign that in the post-crisis world those incentives will serve the overall economy better than the old way.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Poor State of India's Subsidies", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From IndiaNEW DELHI \u2014 The latest economic survey of India contains cheerful prose. India\u2019s immediate future is \u201cpropitious.\u201dBut there are grim bits, too. If the rich reach the third chapter of Volume 1, they may groan with exasperation, because it addresses subsidies for the poor. The chapter is titled \u201cWiping every tear from every eye,\u201d which the elite would translate as \u201cUsing cash as tissues for the poor.\u201d There is a view among the urban upper classes that such subsidies are wasteful.If they continue to read, however, it may change their inner emoticons.The chapter is not just a lament about the abject inefficiency of India\u2019s attempts to subsidize the lives of the poor, but an argument that these huge subsidies benefit the rich more than the poor. The assistance meant for the poor has in fact contributed to the reality that it is cheap to be rich in India.The survey was an analysis by India\u2019s chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian. He considered a set of commodities and utilities that India subsidizes, including rice, wheat, sugar, fuel, electricity, water, fertilizers and rail travel. The cost of these subsidies in fiscal 2014-15 was 3.78 trillion rupees, or $61 billion \u2014 almost enough, he implied, if distributed wisely, to lift every Indian household above the official poverty line.While subsidies protect the poor from price volatility of essential goods, the benefits, Mr. Subramanian argued, are chiefly for the rich, because they consume more or are more able to exploit the services.For instance, rich households gain more from the electricity subsidy than the poor because they have the means to consume more. Most of the poor households do not have electricity in the first place, or use very little of it. Indian Railways loses money on every passenger because the price of train tickets is kept artificially low. But, the survey pointed out, the poorest 80 percent of Indian households constitute less than 30 percent of the railways\u2019 income through fares. The subsidy for liquefied petroleum gas, which is widely used for cooking, also benefits the richer, because the wealthiest 50 percent of Indian households consume 75 percent of the gas.The rich have not cornered the high-carb diet that the government subsidizes in the form of cheap or free wheat and rice. But significant portions of these grains never reach the poor because of \u201cleakages,\u201d which is a euphemism for theft and inefficiencies in the distribution system. The survey estimated that about 54 percent of the wheat and nearly 50 percent of the sugar meant for the poor never get there.Although Mr. Subramanian has contempt for subsidies, he does not dispute that the poor need help. He suggests that India replace subsidies with direct cash transfers to the poor, an idea that has been debated over the past few years. There are concerns among intellectuals that this might lead to inflation, or undesirable domestic situations where, for instance, the rogue man of the house would use the cash to buy inessential, though pleasurable, goods like liquor. Also, some worry that once the state starts putting money into bank accounts, the poor will never let it be stopped or reduced. And, democracy forces politicians to be so populist that India might end up with the burden of both price subsidies and cash transfers.After decades of spending trillions of rupees on subsidies, India still has a vast population that is impoverished, undernourished and hopeless. India\u2019s failed economic experiments, its bleak prospects in agriculture and the economy\u2019s inability to create low-skill manufacturing jobs have ensured that hundreds of thousands of rural migrants head to cities every year. They are usually fleeing the fate of becoming poor farmers. So, they instead become drivers, guards and maids in the city at low wages, further subsidizing the charmed lives of India\u2019s upper classes.When the new Indian elite say, \u201cI love India,\u201d it does mean \u201cI love India.\u201d But it also means, in no small part, \u201cI love my subsidies.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Language of Greek Crisis Shifts From Financial Jargon to Humiliation", "Date": "2015-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Greece\u2019s financial crisis has often been framed in the dry, impersonal language of finance. At issue were credit ratings, bond yields and repayment schedules. The pulse of a collapsing nation was often measured in technical jargon about borrowing costs and primary surpluses.Now, with Greece and its European creditors locked in bitter negotiations this week over the terms of the country\u2019s bailout, the politesse of the talks has disintegrated into starkly personal terms. Now the language of the Greek crisis is about humiliation, national pride, moral hazard and hypocrisy.Most ominously, it has deteriorated into a blunt confrontation between Greece and its biggest creditor, Germany, inflaming public opinion in both countries and reviving recriminations over who owes whom \u2014 always a risky exercise on a continent that has not forgotten the horrors of two world wars or the conflicts of centuries before.Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece used a speech before Parliament on Tuesday to renew a call for Germany to pay reparations to Greece for the crimes and unpaid debts of the Nazis, and his government threatened to seize German assets in Greece.Berlin responded firmly, insisting that the reparations issue is long settled, and the German news media reacted angrily. \u201cIf one takes Athens seriously, then Greece itself, which is so proud of Alexander the Great, would have to fear demands for historical injustice,\u201d Reinhard M\u00fcller wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.The nationalistic antagonism has added an ugly new dimension of populist brinkmanship to an economic crisis that still threatens to fracture the European Union.Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the escalating exchanges risked hardening popular attitudes in Germany and emboldening other populist parties, from the left-wing Podemos in Spain to the right-wing National Front in France.\u201cThe euro was meant to bring Europeans closer together and to strengthen political union,\u201d Mr. Leonard said, but the Greek-German clash has led to a \u201cscary return to civilizational language \u2014 national stereotypes, hatred, lack of trust.\u201d\u201cThe closer you bind Germany and Greece together,\u201d he said, \u201cthe more hostility there is.\u201dThe quarrel may be most vivid in the apparently poisonous relationship between the finance ministers, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble of Germany and Yanis Varoufakis of Greece.Many Greeks see the caustic Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, 72, as the flinty embodiment of a German austerity policy they blame for destroying their country. Many Germans, by contrast, see Mr. Varoufakis, 53, as the swaggering embodiment of an unrepentant Greece trying to shirk its obligations.The rising mutual contempt is not limited to them. The Greek defense minister, Panos Kammenos, threatened this week that if Germany did not support Greece in the debt talks, Greece would send to Berlin the thousands of illegal migrants who have landed in Greece on rickety boats from Africa in recent months. One of Germany\u2019s police unions responded by calling for Greece to be ejected from the zone of 26 countries in Europe where citizens can cross borders freely without visas.It has been clear since Mr. Tsipras and his left-wing Syriza party won power in late January that Greece would take a more confrontational approach in trying to renegotiate the terms of the country\u2019s bailout, worth 240 billion euros ($255 billion).Mr. Tsipras appealed to Greek nationalism during the campaign. He vowed to force the country\u2019s three main creditors \u2014 the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank \u2014 to write off half of Greece\u2019s debts, and to reinstate thousands of public employees who were fired to meet the creditors\u2019 budget demands.Since taking office, though, Mr. Tsipras has been forced to backtrack on many of his promises, even as he framed a four-month extension to the bailout as a political victory.Now, with Greece rapidly running out of money and the European creditors demanding additional action from Athens before they release more loan money, Mr. Tsipras has chosen to revive the question of war reparations.\u201cThe best way to deal with the issue would be by taking legal action, but they decided to politicize the issue,\u201d said Theodore A. Couloumbis, professor emeritus of international relations at the University of Athens, adding that Mr. Tsipras may have decided to do so to distract domestic attention.\u201cIt is embarrassing for a government that came to power on a promise to reverse austerity \u2014 and with rhetoric describing Greece as a debt colony and lenders as loan sharks \u2014 to backtrack,\u201d Mr. Couloumbis added. \u201cThere is a sense among Greeks that they are sick and tired of being told what to do by Merkel and Sch\u00e4uble, and so they should push their claims. Why not?\u201dThe previous Greek government, a center-right coalition, completed a study of the reparations issue in March 2013, but it was not made public until last Sunday. According to an Athens newspaper, the study concluded that Germany may owe Greece over \u20ac30 billion ($32 billion).While the verbal sparring between Mr. Varoufakis and Mr. Sch\u00e4uble has become a public sport, the historical antagonism it has revived is serious.Mr. Varoufakis set the tone in February during his first trip to Germany as finance minister, when he used a joint news conference to remind Germans that Greece\u2019s economic troubles had helped fuel the rise of a neofascist party, Golden Dawn, and to draw a parallel with the rise of Nazism in the 1930s.\u201cNo one can understand better than Germany how a suffering economy, with certain humiliations and a great loss of hope, what effects that can have,\u201d Mr. Varoufakis said, as Mr. Sch\u00e4uble sat nearby. \u201cWe need Germany at our side; we need the support of Germany.\u201dThe outrage felt by some German conservatives toward Greece began to boil over on Feb. 27, when the German Parliament approved a four-month extension to the Greek bailout after a heated debate.\u201cLook at Tsipras, look at Varoufakis,\u201d said one member, Klaus Peter Willsch, in a speech before the vote. \u201cWould you buy a used car from them? When your answer is no, then vote no today.\u201dFor instance, in arguing that Greece should be forgiven its current debts, some in Athens and their supporters cite the 1953 London conference where Germany\u2019s postwar creditors effectively forgave West Berlin about half its external debt \u2014 some 15 billion deutsche marks, equivalent to about 10 percent of West Germany\u2019s gross domestic product in 1953, according to a study by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Berlin. The Germans point to the same conference to argue that the reparations issue is settled. Under the London agreement, which eventually involved 18 foreign creditors, final reparations were to be settled when Germany was reunited, which happened in 1990. At that time, the Germans say, they received no claim from Greece for any more than the 115 million marks paid in the 1970s.\u201cThis chapter is, for us, legally and politically closed,\u201d Steffen Seibert, the German government spokesman, said Wednesday.Still, reports this week that the Greek justice minister, Nikos Paraskevopoulos, was considering signing an order to seize German property in Greece drove some German news outlets into a frenzy. \u201cEnough!\u201d screamed the Bild Zeitung, the country\u2019s most widely read daily newspaper. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want to shout to the Greek government. Day after day, hour by hour come new thrusts from Athens. Bizarre, arrogant, unabashed.\u201dThere was only one conclusion, the newspaper said: \u201cIt\u2019s moral blackmail.\u201dAlison Smale reported from Berlin, and Jim Yardley from Rome. Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Termites: Guardians of the Soil", "Date": "2015-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBasicsThe giant termite mounds that rise up from the sands of the African savanna are so distinctive it\u2019s tempting to give them names, like \u201cArt Deco Skyline\u201d or \u201cTrumpeting Elephant\u201d or \u201cFlagrantly Obvious Fertility Totem.\u201dWhatever the metaphor, the charismatic megaforms dominate their landscape, and not just visually. As scientists are just beginning to appreciate, termites and the often elaborate habitats they construct are crucial to the health and robustness of a broad array of ecosystems: deserts and semideserts; tropical and subtropical rain forests; warm, temperate woodlands; possibly your local park.\u201cEven when you see desertification start to happen between the mounds, the vegetation on or around the mounds is doing so well it will keep reseeding the environment,\u201d said Corina Tarnita, an author on the new report and an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton.And while the public may view termites as pale, blind, half-inch vermin that can genuinely eat you out of house and home, only a handful of the 3,000 or so known termite species are pests to people. Many of the rest, you can thank for the ground beneath your feet, which is where the majority of termites live and tirelessly work. The closer scientists look, the longer grows the list of subterranean tasks that termites take on.\u201cThey\u2019re the ultimate soil engineers,\u201d said David Bignell, a termite expert and emeritus professor of zoology at Queen Mary University of London.By poking holes, or macropores, as they dig through the ground, termites allow rain to soak deep into the soil rather than running off or evaporating. Termites artfully mix inorganic particles of sand, stone and clay with organic bits of leaf litter, discarded exoskeletons and the occasional squirrel tail, a blending that helps the soil retain nutrients and resist erosion.The stickiness of a termite\u2019s feces and other bodily excretions lend structure and coherence to the soil, which also prevents erosion. Bacteria in the termite\u2019s gut are avid nitrogen fixaters, able to extract the vital element from the air and convert it into a usable sort of fertilizer, benefiting the termite host and the vast underground economy.\u201cOver all, termites are extremely good for the health of the soil\u201d on which everything else depends, Dr. Bignell said.Termites are also proving worthy as a so-called model system for understanding the origins of social life, the division of labor, and the sort of altruistic, self-abnegating behavior that we humans applaud in others but generally avoid engaging in ourselves.In a new study of \u201cpanic escape\u201d behavior among termites as they seek to flee from danger, researchers at Louisiana State University Agricultural Center determined that the one thing the termites do not do when experimentally disturbed is act panicky.They don\u2019t start running pell-mell, pushing and shoving, or clambering over the fallen. They don\u2019t behave like people in a crowded theater when somebody yells fire, or like stampeding walruses, or, for that matter, like ants whose nest has been harrowed.Instead, the researchers found that when they placed 110 termites on round plastic dishes and gave the plates a shake, the termites started running in an extremely orderly, rules-based fashion, depending on whether they were ordinary workers or soldiers dedicated to nest defense.The workers fell into single-file formation. The ones in front decided whether to turn left or right, and the rest followed in a unidirectional flow at a uniform speed and spacing.For their part, the soldiers migrated to either side of the flow, snapping their huge mandibles as though preparing to do battle. Round and round the dishbound termites trotted, fruitlessly but never frantically seeking an exit. If one termite stumbled or slowed down, those behind would stop and wait for it to right itself: No trampling allowed.That may be because they have had a lot of practice. Termites, Dr. Henderson said, \u201cwere the first animals to form societies,\u201d starting down the communal path about 200 million years ago, some 50 million years earlier than the ants and their hymenopteran cousins, the bees.All eusocial insects share the same policy: a strict division of labor, and the assigning of colony breeding privileges to a single large, long-lived, perpetually egg-laying queen. Yet while the overwhelming majority of individuals in an ant nest or beehive are sterile, closely related females, a termite colony is pretty much 50-50 males and females, brothers and sisters.Why termite society turned eusocial in the first place, an evolutionary leap that denied nearly all its citizenry the seemingly Darwinian right to personal reproduction, remains an active topic of research. By some calculations, the driving force was the sheer efficiency of scale. If the termites in a given colony are siblings, or at least close cousins, they can do a better job of fostering their genetic legacy by stoking their egg-laying queen mother than by bothering to mate on their own.And termites have been enormously successful. Taxonomically, they\u2019re considered \u201ca superior kind of cockroach,\u201d as Dr. Bignell puts it, but termites account for a far greater portion of the world\u2019s insect biomass than do all the other cockroaches combined. In the tropics, where social insects rule, the termites outweigh the ants hundredfold.With the help of symbiotic bacteria and protozoa packed into the termitic paunch at what might be the highest microbial densities in nature, termites thrive by eating what others can\u2019t or won\u2019t: wood, dung, lichen, even dirt.The great termite artists of Africa, the mound builders, have also recruited an external symbiont, a fungus, which they cultivate in tunnels and galleries deep inside vast palaces built of sand, clay and termite excretions. The termites eat a small portion of the fungal spores and use the fungal enzymes to help break down their more fibrous food sources.The termites in turn offer their fungal partners plenty of water, nourishment and a clean, safe, temperate and well-ventilated haven free of competing fungal strains. The mounds also protect their builders \u2014 against the sun that would desiccate them, the seasonal rain that would drown them, and the many predators that would happily devour them.The largest African mounds can measure 30 feet high and 80 feet across, and house millions to tens of millions of termites. The mounds are refugia for plants, fungi and large herbivores, too. In Mozambique\u2019s Gorongosa National Park, antelope like bushbuck and kudu often congregate around termite mounds, and not just for the grazing opportunities.\u201cThe mounds are cooler in the heat of day and warmer at night,\u201d said Robert Pringle, an ecologist at Princeton and an author of the report in Science. \u201cThey\u2019re a very pleasant place to hang out.\u201dA photograph with an earlier version of this article was published in error.

{"Headline": "At Roberta\u2019s, Pizza and a Broken Partnership", "Date": "2015-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt all got rolling in the middle of 2007, when the national economy was faltering and the graffiti-tagged, barbed-wired lots of Bushwick, Brooklyn, seemed like a perfectly apocalyptic place in which to start a never-ending party. But the positive vibes have dissipated, at least for the founders. Mr. Parachini, the original leader of the enterprise, has parted ways with the others, and the three are fighting over millions of dollars in a legal showdown that has involved a call to the police and a request for a restraining order. They have declined to discuss the matter with the news media, but their discord underscores the same blunt reality that bedevils every indie-rock band that makes it big: Even for (and perhaps especially for) the scrappy, from-scratch operations that believe in a higher calling, money can be messy.\u201cAs much as Roberta\u2019s is an art project, and as much as it\u2019s about rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, it is a business,\u201d said Gabe McMackin, one of many talented cooks to have passed through the Bushwick kitchen. It is no exaggeration to compare Roberta\u2019s to a garage band. The place has always styled itself as being about much more than food. Equipped with picnic tables and a tented tiki bar and an on-site radio station, Roberta\u2019s can feel like a slacker version of Studio 54 as staged by \u201cPortlandia\u201d extras in an abandoned abattoir. Even as the endeavor evolved into something more ambitious, freedom served as the governing principle. Many cooks who clocked time in the kitchen remember the mission statement as being an expletive-studded version of \u201cwhatever turns you on.\u201dShe remembered Mr. Mirarchi as being laid-back and reluctant to interfere, and recalled her instructions as \u201c\u00a0\u2018We don\u2019t care what you do \u2014 just go bake some bread.\u2019\u00a0\u201dStill, keeping it loose can mean letting it go slack, and even for the most passionate of Roberta\u2019s partisans, there are lingering memories of an institutional chaos theory that often felt more chaos than theory: pizza makers who drank on the job (until persuaded to stop); ice cream that regularly melted because the freezer had been unplugged to fire up a sound system for parties; crew members who arrived bright and early for the job only because they had conked out on the premises the night before.\u201cIt was never a surprise when the person I was working with showed up drunk, or had been up all night tripping on acid,\u201d Mr. McMackin said.If that sense of play helped fuel early success, some say it\u2019s also what led to fractures as the founders pursued invitations to float their pirate ship of a brand in new seas.He said conflict, inevitable in any business, is intensified when people realize \u201cwe can make money from this thing.\u201d While Mr. Mirarchi oversaw the food and Mr. Hoy took on the role of perpetual party host, people close to the restaurant say that Mr. Parachini stood out as the boss; he held the title of president of the Roberta\u2019s corporation, and the restaurant is named after his mother. \u201cIt was Chris\u2019s brainchild, really,\u201d said his lawyer, Derek Wolman, adding that Mr. Parachini spearheaded new projects and that \u201cthe big-picture C.E.O. role is what Chris has always relished.\u201d Court documents refer to possible projects in Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan, as well as Asia. Last summer, Mr. Parachini said in an affidavit, the partners went to Los Angeles to discuss a possible restaurant attached to a new Ace hotel on the Lower East Side.\u201cDuring this trip,\u201d he said, \u201cMirarchi and Hoy expressed frustration with the state of the various deals and new ventures we were working on.\u201dHow to grow \u2014 that was the concern, which eventually led to \u201ca disagreement on what the future should look like and who should take the lead,\u201d Mr. Wolman said. \u201cFrankly, Chris is surprised Brandon and Carlo really have tried to hijack the company in the last few months.\u201d Documents suggest, however, that Mr. Hoy and Mr. Mirarchi, both in their 30s, worried that Mr. Parachini, 42, had become a hindrance. They found some of his ideas eccentric and unworkable, and worried about his heated interactions with people, including staff members. Things have become messier. Legal filings from Mr. Mirarchi and Mr. Hoy suggest that they fired Mr. Parachini as president and offered him a $2 million buyout. Mr. Parachini, who countered with a higher figure, contends that he cannot be fired, at least not without a formal discussion by Roberta\u2019s board. In his affidavit, he said he never resigned or agreed to relinquish his right to manage the company.\u201cWhat I did agree to,\u201d he said, \u201cwas that during the negotiations for the purchase of my shares I would not come into the office.\u201dMr. Parachini did come into the restaurant in December, and his appearance prompted a call to the police \u2014 and, later, a temporary restraining order and a lawsuit by his partners. Responding to suggestions that his presence posed some sort of threat, Mr. Parachini testified that \u201cI have no history of violence nor have I ever threatened any of my partners or employees. This is a total fabrication.\u201dThe offstage quarrel seems to have had little impact on business at Roberta\u2019s, where the welcome is still friendly and even during a weekday lunch hour it\u2019s not uncommon to find every table filled. Somewhat remarkably, Mr. Parachini\u2019s lawyer said the partners\u2019 relationship was not necessarily beyond repair. \u201cHopefully they can patch up their differences,\u201d Mr. Wolman said. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that that still is possible.\u201d Whatever happens, it\u2019s doubtful that the devil-may-care wildness of those early years will return.\u201cNothing lasts,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From the Archives:\u00a0Where\u2019s the Spirit of Selma Now?", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySELMA, Ala. \u2014 A tourist, driving through Alabama, sees a road sign marked SELMA, and it jumps at him, lures him; and following it, he goes 40, 50 miles out of his way through the narrow, winding roads of the Black Belt, breezing under the lush green trees hung with gray moss, then up gentle hills past white farmhouses and quiet cows and old statues of Confederate soldiers, and not stopping until he sees a small concrete bridge, which he recognizes immediately. He has seen it often this year on television. It is the Edmund Pettus Bridge. It crosses the Alabama River and leads into Selma.The bridge was named after a Confederate general but, like many mementos of the Old South early this spring, it was accorded only a minimum of reverence \u2014 for Selma, then, became a city of strangers. And all they cared about, those civil-rights demonstrators who crossed the bridge on that sunny Sunday afternoon on March 7, was that it was a link to Montgomery; they had no idea that, within minutes, it would become a backdrop for perhaps the most dramatic and provocative scene in the South.When the more than 520 Negroes, marching two abreast and carrying satchels filled with extra clothing and shoes for the 50-mile journey to Montgomery, the state capital, did not retreat across the bridge as they were told, a charging wedge of Alabama state troopers moved toward them with billy clubs and gas grenades. What followed were the sounds of plastic helmets and wood crashing into flesh, strange sounds \u2014 clack, clup, clop \u2014 followed by the cries of Negroes falling to the highway, the cheers of white locals watching on the other side of the road, the hoof clicks of nervous horses mounted by a sheriff\u2019s posse anxious to get into the act, the ticking of television cameras recording the whole scene, to be spun around the world and come bommeranging back to Selma.Soon thousands of sympathizers were bound for Selma \u2014 nuns, debutantes, psychiatrists, banjo players, Senators\u2019 wives, stock clerks, sculptors, social workers, social climbers, dropouts \u2014 and for most of the month they lived in Selma\u2019s Negro quarter, shared the Negro\u2019s food and misery, sang his songs and scorned his oppressors; helped inspire a new guilt, a new social conscience, a new voting bill in America; helped instill in Alabama, among many illiterate and uninspired Negroes, a strange new hope that after the bridge had been crossed, after Montgomery finally had been reached, everything would somehow be all right, a kind of miracle would occur \u2014 it would be like Lourdes and the faithful might toss away their crutches.And so, when tourists drive over the Edmund Pettus Bridge and dip down the gentle approachway into the heart of Selma\u2019s business district, entering a very wide street lined by globe-lights and stores and shiny new cars, their faces are alive with anticipation. They drive slowly. They look ahead, look to the left, look to the right. They have the look of Boy Scouts looking for arrowheads. But slowly, very slowly, their expressions change from anticipation to bewilderment. Where is everything? They see nothing. They see only people, Negro and-white, walking casually up and down Broad street and in and out of shops. They see a policeman directing traffic. They see children on bicycles; young men in sports cars, farmers loading supplies; businessmen strolling into the corner drugstore for a cup of coffee. They see no marchers. They hear no one yelling \u201cFreedom Now!\u201d or singing \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201dThey feel cheated, many of these tourists, and they wonder if Selma was merely a show, a circus now moved to another town \u2014 not realizing that remnants remain, not realing that as they gaze upon Selma with innocent tourist eyes, they themselves are being watched by whites who suspect them of the worst, who despise them. Selma\u2019s whites now regard all strangers \u2014 tourists, civil-rights workers, government agents, newsmen \u2014 as \u201coutside agitators,\u201d people who do not understand, do not know history, do not know that long, long before Martin Luther King came marching through Selma, there had been another man named King \u2014 and that he had helped shape the destiny of this city in a manner that is still unbroken despite the revolution of 1965.William Rufus King was the first wealthy white settler in Selma, and he set a style of life that was soon emulated by other early settlers, most of them prosperous: they built magnificent mansions, cleared 1,000-acre plantations, planted cotton, imported slaves.By 1840, Selma was the heart of Alabama\u2019s booming cotton economy, and there were considerably more slaves than whites; but the whites, while continuing their genteel existence, dabbling in politics and culture and horse racing (one Selma thoroughbred, Letty Lee, won big races in London, Paris and Berlin), kept the Negroes in line with 27 ordinances regulating slave behavior. If slaves were discovered away from their homes without written permission from their owners, they might be punished by 39 lashes; if found smoking a cigar or pipe on the streets, or carrying a walk cane \u2014 another 39 lashes.In 1848, 300 German immigrants, many of them ironworkers and mechanics, came to Selma and inroduced iron casting and gunmaking; and as the city was served by both river and railroad, it became an ideal supply depot and industrial center for the Confederate states just before the war began. Thus it also became, in the spring of 1865, a major military objective of the North.That April 2, Selma was attacked by 9,000 Northern soldiers including a Negro regiment, who overwhelmed the 3,000 Confederate defenders and destroyed the city. They burned homes and public buildings, butchered horses, destroyed 35,000 bales of cotton, and then, discovering barrels of whisky that the Confederates did not have time to destroy, they continued to sack the city through a wild and drunken night.Perhaps no part of Alabama was more ravaged by the war and Reconstruction than Selma, and much of the bitterness has remained. It may account in part for the fact that shortly after the United States Supreme Court\u2019s school desegregation decision in 1954, Selma became the first Alabama city to organize a Citizen\u2019s Council; and this biterness, too, may have helped shape the racial views of such native sons as T. Eugene (Bull) Connor, the Police Commissioner: who led dogs and directed firehoses against Negro demonstraters in Birmlngham; and Leonard Wilson, a Unlversity of Alabama student who in 1956 led a campus movement aimed at preventing the Negro student, Autherine Lucy, from attending classes there; and James G. Clark, Jr., Selma\u2019s sheriff and its symbol of segregation this spring, who when asked by newsmen if he had any hero that influenced his thinking, unhesitatingly replied, \u201cNathan Bedford Forrest.\u201dForrest was the Confederate general who tried to defend Selma from 9,000 \u201coutside agitators\u201d back in 1865, and Sheriff Clark saw himself, 100 years later, as trying to do the same thing. Both failed. And their failures were followed by quietude. But scars remain.These scars are not easily spotted by tourists who visit Selma today, but they are there, sometimes on the surface of the city, sometimes beneath. There is a quiet hate now between large numbers of Selma\u2019s white and black citizens \u2014a reaction not unlike that which existed after the Battle of Belma in 1865. Today many Selma whites who formerly referred to Negroes as \u201ccolored folks\u201d are snapping out with \u201cnigger\u201d; and Negro hitchhikers, who once could easily get a ride into town from the outskirts, today are waiting long hours along the road and usually end up walking. It is said that nearly 200 Negroes have lost their jobs in Selma since the demonstration began here.And the simple truth, as of now, is that despite all the parades through Selma in March, all the slogans and television shows and sermons and songs \u2014 and all the talk \u2014 the common Negro in this town today is generally no better off (indeed, he is worse off in some cases, being unemployed mad more hated) than he was before the whole civil-rights push got started.The schools are still segregated. So are the Y.M.C.A., the pool, the jail. The restaurants and hotels are not segregated, but Negroes feel so unwelcome that they stay away; only an extremely game Negro now dares to test laws in this hostile atmosphere. (\u201cYou can\u2019t legislate how people feel,\u201d says Selma\u2019s City Council president, Carl Morgan.)Most of the churches, though they deny it, are segregated \u2014 segregated in spirit, segregated in the sense that the white parishioners would rather not see black men in the pews on Sunday, to put it mildly; and this includes most of Selma\u2019s Jews who attend the Temple Mishkan Israel, most of Selma\u2019s Catholics who attend the Church of the Assumption, and most of the white Protestants who attend the other churches here.(\u201cIf I would shout \u2018Integration,\u2019 they would think I am crazy, they might drive me out of town,\u201d explains Selma\u2019s Rabbi Lothar Lubasch, who escaped Nazi Germany in 1938. Then he added, \u2018It is easy for outsiders to come and march here ..., but when they leave, they leave us the pieces....)Negro requests for representation on the Selma police force have so far been denied on the grounds of insufficient funds and no immediate plans to add new patrolmen; and Negro chances for fair employment in skilled positions in Selma businesses have not, so far, been improved by the civil rights demonstrations last March. The relationship between the Negro job seeker and white employer today is at a low point, and much of this animosity springs from the fact that many Negroes now are buying either from the few Negro merchants in Selma or in cities beyond Selma. This not only has infuriated the white merchant in Selma, but has (in cases where the merchant catered to Negro trade) hurt him financially. But it has embittered him even more than it has hurt him, and so he is not about to knuckle under and hire a Negro, say, as a sales clerk in a clothing store where the Negro will come face to face with white customers.Those Negroes who twice each month line up outside the Dallas County Courthouse are kept waiting, they say, five and six hours in the sun; and then, if they are a minute late in reporting to the registrar\u2019s desk after their number has been called, or if they did not hear it (which is sometimes the case), they are told to come back in two weeks because they were too late.While Negro leaders are meeting regularly with Selma\u2019s Mayor Smitherman, it is mostly, as one city councilman put it, \u201ctalk.\u201d The Negroes will begin by complaining, say, about police hostility or about lack of jobs or lack of paved streets. Then the whites, after listening patiently for a while, will deny any police hostility and will suggest that Negro unemployment problems would vanish if only Negroes would cooperate. How? the Negroes ask. By stopping those damned petitions, say the whites, such petitions as the one urging the Hammermill Paper Company not to open a new plant in Selma; and by stopping the boycott of Selma businessmen. But, the Negroes say, boycotting is a major civil-rights weapon, an indispensable nonviolent tactic in waking up whites. And, the Negroes continue, what excuse is there for all the unpaved roads in Selma\u2019s Negro quarter? Well, the whites say, the only way a neighborhood\u2019s streets can get paved in Selma, as in many Southern towns, is by assessing those who live on the street. We have no money, say the Negroes. You\u2019d get money, say the whites, if you\u2019d stop that damned boycotting and marching and hollering; if, instead of intimidating industrialists who might come down to Selma, you would take an ad in the paper saying everything is fine in Selma; then you would have more industry here, more jobs, more money for paving your streets. You\u2019re stalling us, say the Negroes, you\u2019re dragging your feet.Thus it goes at these weekly meetings \u2014 just \u201ctalk,\u201d as the councilman says. And this lack of progress so far has tended to discourage all but the most determined of Selma\u2019s Negroes \u2014 and, in truth, many Selma Negroes, these grandchildren of Selma\u2019s slaves who chose to remain here after their \u201cfreedom\u201d was won by the North, are not determined Negroes. They are passive Negroes, by and large, and if they are going to make advances, they must be led, must be mobilized, must be marched by civil-rights leaders. And today most of the leaders and civil-rights freedom-fighters \u2014 both black and white \u2014 have abandoned Selma. They have either returned to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago or Atlanta; or perhaps they have found a new cause in another town, be it a Demopolis, Ala., or a Syracuse, N.Y. \u2014 in any case, they are not in Selma, as any tourist who wanders into the Negro quarter of this town can see.On Sylvan Street, that famous street of so many crowds ago \u2014 that street in which Negro and white demonstrators, nuns and S.N.C.C. boys and Radcliffe girls and labor leaders joined hands and stood all day and night in a driving rainstorm and sang \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d \u2014 that street today, deserted except for a few small Negro children playing in the gutter and some adults who slowly come and go, is a street where the Movement is now crawling.The rain has stopped in Selma, the storm is over. It is now May and it is a bright hot sun that beats down on Sylvan Street and makes piecrust of bumpy dirt roads, bakes the concrete pavement, scorches the grass. All along Sylvan Street are lined red brick houses, identically designed, and within them live the Negroes who, back in March, were hosts and hostesses to hundreds of whites who came to \u201cmake witness\u201d in Selma, and now these homes on Sylvan Street are filled with thank-you notes, with large unpaid telephone bills \u2014 run up by out-of-state demonstrators who asked to use the phone \u2014 with glorious memories of days and nights the streets when the streets were never unsung with Negro songs that the whites learned, these whites who had come from all over the nation to Selma even though, prior to coming, many never before had sung a Negro song, slept in a Negro home, prayed in a Negro church, or felt so safe at night on a block filled with Negroes.It was a fantastic time, so wondrously unreal: Negro laborers shaking hands with Mrs. Paul Douglas; Negro scrubwoman kissing Dr. King; the Ivy League girl and S.N.C.C. boy sitting together on the steps of the Negro Baptist church discussing Truth; all the whites calling the elderly Selma Negroes \u201cMr.\u201d \u201cMrs.\u201d and caring about them in a way that Selma Negroes had never before been cared about by whites, and might never be again: yes, a wondrously unreal time, and it was climaxed by the big march to Montgomery, being protected by the Federal Government, sung to by Sammy Davis Jr., encouraged by James Baldwin and admired the world over \u2014 and hated by the whites in Selma. But now, in May, as the Mayor of Selma says, \u201cthings are pretty much back to normal.\u201dHe says it as many white leaders in Selma today say it: with a knowing nod, a half-smile, a Southerner\u2019s sense of Northern hypocrisy. After all, they say, this is not the first time the \u201cagitators\u201d from outside have come barging into Selma to win a cause for the Negro; they did it in 1865 and then, the battle won, they went off and left the Selma Negroes and Selma whites with, as the rabbi put it, \u201cthe pieces.\u201dHowever, it is not entirely true to say that all whites have abandoned Selma. There are still a dozen or so living or working in the Negro quarter, helping with the voter registration program, helping Negro adults and children in all ways possible, still \u201cmaking witness\u201d in this symbolic city. These include a tall, blond Californian 22-year-old Dennis Coleman, a former marine now working with the Selma Committee for Community Development; Donna Smith, a 20-year-old former coed from Tyler, Tex., also with S.C.C.D.; a white Methodist minister from Berkeley, the Rev. David Smith; and a 19-year-old blonde from Hamilton, Calif., who is married to and now living here with a 22-year-old Negro named Gerald Turley, one of Dr. King\u2019s assistants with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.\u201cIn Selma,\u201d Mrs. Turley says, \u2018\u201cI\u2019m classified as a white nigger,\u201d and her husband adds that they do not walk through the white district together or alone; if they wish to leave the Negro quarter, they usually bring others with them for protection.Like most of the civil-rights workers now on Sylvan Street, the Turleys have very little money, and eat most of their meals at Brown Chapel, the Negro church that was headquarters for the movement this spring. They share living space with another Negro family on Sylvan Street. They met in August, 1964, in California; Carol Turley, now a volunteer worker with S.C.L.C., saw her future husband on a picket line demonstrating against the hiring practices of the Bank of America. A conversation followed, then a date and, six months later, marriage.In March, they were part of the procession to Montgomery and now they are living in Selma and they are both, though not vehement about it, disappointed that more white people did not stay in Selma.\u201cThe white people came down here and demonstrated, then went back North feeling very good that they had come,\u201d Gerald Turley was saying the other day, standing on a sunny sidewalk near Brown Chapel. \u201cThe whites felt they did their share, and they did a lot. Some of them have sent money back to Selma, and clothes and they helped focus attention on the problem of Selma, and we appreciate that. But they shouldn\u2019t feel that they solved anything, because they didn\u2019t. The problem is still here.\u201dA block away, in the basement of the First Baptist Church on the comer of Sylvan Street, a Negro named Ernest L. Doyle, who is in charge of receiving all gifts mailed to Selma to help Negro citizens, particularly those unemployed, was saying, \u201cWe\u2019re very thankful for all we\u2019ve received, but there were a lot of white people who came down here and made promises and then, when they went back home, they forgot us.\u201d He said that the amount of money pledged in March, was far, far more impressive than the amount received as of May.What has been received, and what is now piled high along the walls and floor of the church\u2019s basement, is hundreds and hundreds of used dresses and hats and coats; cartons of canned goods, sacks of rice, boxes of books and soap and hairpins and Fritos; and thousands of pairs of women\u2019s shoes, high heels, low heels, no heels, some shoes unmatched \u2014 and also seven pairs of ice skates.\u201cOh, if Dr. King could only stay here we\u2019d have no problems,\u201d a Negro woman named Mary Lamar, who lives down the block from the church, was saying. \u201cDr. King is a second Moses. And he could come here and say, \u2018We\u2019re going to all march in the Alabama River,\u2019 and we\u2019d all do it. But when he isn\u2019t here, we!l, some local leaders, they don\u2019t always think like Dr. King ... and there are so many of these in CORE, the S.N.C.C. the Dallas County Voters League, the Dallas County Youth League, the Selma Emergency Relief Fund \u2014 you have all the leaders and, well, they kind of confuse things.... They\u2019re not Dr. King.\u201d\u201cMrs. Lumar is one of the Negro women who have kept in touch with the whites who shared her home in March, and in fact, she recently accepted an offer to fly to New York, all expenses paid, and appear before civic clubs to discuss the sins of Selma. One of the places Mrs. Lamar visited was Syracuse, which had sent 62 down to Selma in March, but when the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation was being picketed in Syracuse by CORE in May for \u201ctokensim\u201d only 20 of the 62 Selma \u201cveterans\u201d demonstrated in public, according to a spokesman for CORE, who cited it as yet another example of \u201dNorthern hypocrisy.\u201dMrs. Lamar, though hardened to the realities, still has not lost hope, and she is happy \u2014 \u201cfor my children\u2019s sake\u201d \u2014 that there was an event like Selma. For, while her life is no better than before \u2014 \u201dI\u2019m poorer than before,\u201d she says, holding up a telephone bill totaling $103.18 \u2014 she feels that Selma, with all its faults and hypocrisy and unfulfilled promises, has made a lasting impression in the South and beyond.\u201cSelma did something,\u201d agrees another Negro woman, Mabel Evans, who lives a few doors away. \u201dIt did something that\u2019s hard to explain, but it\u2019s inside where you can\u2019t see it ... I mean, you remember when Jim Clark said there wasn\u2019t gonna be no march to Montgomery except over his dead body? Well, we marched, didn\u2019t we? And a lot of other things happened here that we thought we never gonna see happen... and maybe it will help change the thinking of the Negroes ... not now ... but years from now ...\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Hands Venezuelan Leader a Cause to Stir Support ", "Date": "2015-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisBut with Mr. Obama\u2019s declaration this week that Venezuela is an \u201cextraordinary threat to the national security\u201d of the United States, that dynamic may be coming undone.Suddenly, the United States is being cast again in the familiar role of the hemispheric bully trying to push around its smaller neighbors. And Mr. Maduro has taken on the mantle of victim, stirring up patriotic support at home, setting the opposition on the defensive and declaring that \u201cwe will never kneel before this arrogant empire that attacks and threatens\u201d his country.\u201cThe optics of this are really just awful,\u201d said David A. Smilde, a sociology professor at Tulane University who lives part time in Venezuela. \u201cIt was a strategic mistake. I think the Maduro government is going to get a lot of play out of this.\u201dThe declaration by Mr. Obama came in an executive order that he signed on Monday. It authorized the American government to freeze any assets in the United States held by seven Venezuelan law enforcement and military officials whom Washington identified as being responsible for human rights abuses or violations of democratic due process.While Washington hoped the move would focus attention on deteriorating conditions in Venezuela, it may have backfired by giving Mr. Maduro new momentum. Critics fear that he will use it as an excuse to crack down harder on an opposition that he characterizes as siding with the enemy.On Tuesday evening, Mr. Maduro went before the National Assembly, warning that the United States was poised to attack Venezuela and saying that legislators should grant him decree powers that will allow him to make laws on his own.\u201cThe aggression and the threat of the government of the United States is the greatest threat that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, our country, has ever received,\u201d he said to applause, with the yellow, blue and red presidential sash draped over his shoulder and a gold medal pinned over his heart. \u201cLet\u2019s close ranks like a single fist of men and women. We want peace.\u201dHe spoke of past American military interventions in Latin America and warned that the United States was preparing an invasion and a naval blockade of Venezuela.\u201cFor human rights, they are preparing to invade us,\u201d he said, adding that he would personally oversee military exercises this Saturday for the defense of the country.\u201cI invite the entire Venezuelan people, in all the states and regions of the country, to join in,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one messes with our country. The Yankee boot will never touch it.\u201dVenezuela and the United States have long had troubled relations, even though the United States is a major buyer of Venezuelan oil, the country\u2019s main export.Mr. Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, delighted in taunting and criticizing Washington. Mr. Maduro has followed Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s lead, accusing the United States of sabotaging the economy and planning to overthrow him \u2014 accusations that officials in Washington have forcefully denied.In recent months, as the Venezuelan economy has faltered and oil prices and his popularity have plunged, Mr. Maduro has raised the volume.Officials in Washington said that declaring Venezuela a national security threat was largely a formality required by law in order to carry out sanctions, as was a further declaration in the executive order that the threat constituted a national emergency for the United States.They also stressed that the sanctions were not against the country of Venezuela but only against individuals deemed responsible for human rights or other violations.\u201cThe action taken earlier this week sends an unequivocal message on human rights and corruption,\u201d William H. Duncan, the director of the State Department\u2019s office of Andean affairs, said in a telephone interview Wednesday.He rejected criticism that the action had backfired.\u201cThis is not something you can take a snapshot of,\u201d Mr. Duncan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about today, it\u2019s not about tomorrow, it\u2019s about what happens in Venezuela over the long haul.\u201d He added, \u201cThe Venezuelan government\u2019s suggestion that we would meet this national emergency with force is simply not true.\u201dIn part, the reaction seemed shaped by the language in the executive order, which declared that a small country in the midst of an economic crisis was a threat to the United States. To some, it raised the specter of past instances when Washington had manufactured threats to justify military action.And it did not sit well in a region that resents historical American heavy-handedness and enjoys an increasing sense of independence from Washington.Some Venezuelan opposition leaders cringed at the American move and said that it had put them on the defensive.\u201cVenezuela is not a threat to any country,\u201d said the main opposition coalition, Democratic Unity, in a statement distancing itself from the American action and voicing disapproval of \u201cunilateral sanctions.\u201dThe Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and members of the Union of South American Nations, two regional bodies, issued statements expressing concern.President Rafael Correa of Ecuador, a leftist ally of Venezuela, was more forceful, blasting the American move on Monday in a series of Twitter posts.\u201cIt ought to be a joke in bad taste that reminds us of the darkest hours of our America, when we received invasions and dictatorships imposed by the imperialists,\u201d Mr. Correa wrote. \u201cCan\u2019t they understand that Latin America has changed?\u201dCuba issued a statement giving its \u201cunconditional support\u201d for Venezuela, a vital ally that supplies it with subsidized oil. It called the sanctions \u201carbitrary and aggressive.\u201dMany regional leaders remained silent, but Mr. Smilde said that the greater damage could come in a lack of support for American-led attempts to pressure Venezuela to ease up on the opposition.\u201cIt makes it much less likely that all the countries in the region are going to make statements or take actions or do anything that could look at the basic issues in Venezuela of human rights and governance,\u201d he said.The Obama administration last year resisted Congressional efforts to impose sanctions on Venezuela, which were pushed by legislators from both parties most closely tied to the traditional Cuban-American lobby advocating tougher actions toward Cuba and its leaders, Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro.But Congress passed a sanctions law in December and Mr. Obama signed it the day after announcing that he would normalize relations with Cuba and lift many of the elements of the economic embargo against Cuba.The Cuba initiative won Mr. Obama resounding praise in Latin America \u2014 even from Mr. Maduro \u2014 and seemed to clear a fresh path for American diplomacy in the region. At least some of that new atmosphere seemed to evaporate this week.Patricia Torres contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "ClassPass and the Joy and Guilt of the Digital Middleman Economy", "Date": "2015-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySearch ResultsI\u2019m a relatively early adopter of ClassPass \u2014 I signed up last October \u2014 and so far, it\u2019s kind of a dream. Memberships to a single yoga, Pilates or spin studio can cost as much as $200 or $300 a month, or upward of $20 for an individual class. A monthly membership to ClassPass costs $99 in New York and offers access to a multitude of gyms, studios and meditation classes in each city where the company operates (though some of the biggest brand names in fitness, like SoulCycle and YogaWorks, seem to have opted out). Most of my favorite yoga studios have classes on the service, and I\u2019ve begun dabbling in kickboxing, indoor cycling and rowing for a fraction of what I would pay otherwise. Like Uber, Instacart and Seamless, ClassPass offers a considerable leap in efficiency and convenience, paired with a price cut that seems too good to be true.But just as I try to be a conscientious consumer who buys organic food and recycles, I\u2019m working on being mindful of the larger economic and environmental impact of the software and apps that I use. Are the studios that work with ClassPass able to do it sustainably? Or does the service push the limits of their business model?While attending classes, I\u2019ve picked up on notes of tension between the company and its partner studios. It\u2019s not uncommon for instructors at individual studios to implore ClassPass users to sign up for regular packages and become members \u2014 an unlikely proposition for people who are already paying $99 a month to ClassPass. It\u2019s normal enough that they would want to up-sell newcomers, but the urgency and undertone of desperation in their voices signal something else afoot in the financial realities of their partnership.ClassPass pays studios a set amount of money for each class that is booked through its systems. It declined to give me specifics on how that rate is determined. Two of the owners of a studio that I frequent, however, were willing to talk. Ashley Lively and Karla Misjan run a clean and cute boutique gym called SyncStudio, which offers cycling, yoga and strength training. Since working with ClassPass, they\u2019ve seen an influx of new customers, me among them.\u201cThe biggest appeal is marketing,\u201d Lively told me. But because most of their new customers come through ClassPass, she said, they\u2019re less likely to sign up for SyncStudio\u2019s $175 monthly membership. For each class booked through ClassPass, the company pays less than the studio\u2019s $18 drop-in rate. \u201cA full class running at half the cost doesn\u2019t make you money,\u201d Lively said. \u201cSometimes, the economics don\u2019t make sense.\u201dBusinesses like restaurants, bookstores and exercise studios already operate on thin margins, and their relationships to digital middlemen like ClassPass can quickly become untenable \u2014 especially because most intermediaries take a commission and may also charge for advertising and processing credit-card transactions. The power imbalance is worsened by the winner-take-all tendencies of the Internet economy: As companies like Amazon, Uber and Seamless have grown, it\u2019s increasingly difficult for their suppliers to push back on onerous terms.Already, ClassPass is cornering its market. In February, the company booked 600,000 reservations through its service; last year, that number was closer to 10,000. The company now operates in 28 different American cities, employs more than 100 people and offers classes from 2,500 different studios. In January, it raised $40 million in venture capital, bringing its total funding to $54 million.\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely lost a significant number of membership people to ClassPass,\u201d Misjan told me. Lively added, \u201cIt\u2019s more than direct competition \u2014 it\u2019s fierce competition.\u201d If ClassPass continues to grow in size, entire businesses could become dependent on it \u2014 and yet, resisting it already seems futile. \u201cThat\u2019s like going back to sending letters because you decide you hate email,\u201d Lively said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201dClassPass does let studios decide which classes they list through the service, allowing studios to direct users to time slots and days that might otherwise go empty. Lively told me that ClassPass is better than Groupon, at least, in that the company makes a point to listen to her frustrations and grievances and respond when it can.Payal Kadakia, co-founder and chief executive of ClassPass, says she is working to figure out how to build a more sophisticated pricing system that benefits both the studios and her company. She said the company\u2019s recent decision to raise money was in part an effort to not have to raise its own prices or reduce the amount it\u2019s able to pay out to studios. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about discounted pricing but making sure each of these studios is growing,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to cannibalize their loyalists.\u201dIn general, Silicon Valley likes to argue that middleman services offer customers, jobs and opportunity where there were none before. O.K., sure. But that argument often glosses over the human costs associated with convenience. Those of us who use these services the most are often the blindest to their potential consequences.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer at the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Demand for Welders Resurges, Community Colleges Offer Classes", "Date": "2015-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Shifting MiddleC.J. Molina, center, a 36-year-old military veteran with four children, at a welding class at San Jacinto, a community college south of Houston. Welding and other once-faltering industrial occupations are finding new life in Texas and the Gulf Coast region.HOUSTON \u2014 Ryan Gassett had already put in a full day, moving heavy boxes and furniture for $15 an hour, when his introductory welding class began at 10 p.m. By the time he arrived at Lone Star College north of Houston, the highway toll collectors at the exit for the school had closed for the night and the campus janitors were mopping bathrooms.The graveyard-shift course was not his first choice, Mr. Gassett, 19, explained, but \u201cthere were no other openings.\u201d So he took what he could get.In recent decades, welding \u2014 like other blue-collar trades that once provided high-school graduates with a reliable route to the middle class \u2014 seemed to have about as promising a future as rotary phones. But many of these once-faltering occupations are finding new life in Texas and the Gulf Coast region, where an industrial revival built around the energy boom continues to spawn petrochemical plants and miles of new pipeline despite the plunge in crude oil prices.The insistent hunger for welders in the Gulf Coast region has created an unusually close partnership between the energy industry and local community colleges to train people for disappearing skills.In Oyster Creek, about an hour south of Houston, Fluor also operates its own training site aimed at rebuilding the thinned ranks of welders. A large roadside banner, proclaiming that welders can earn $35 an hour, beckons potential job seekers. Yellow school buses transport workers to nearby round-the-clock construction sites, where they put in 10- to 12-hour shifts before returning to a makeshift trailer hub for free welding, pipe-fitting and other classes.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a big gap,\u201d said Jennifer Taylor, a training coordinator at Fluor. \u201cThe old ones are retiring and the new ones are just coming up.\u201dThrough most of the 1980s, the number of welders nationwide topped 550,000. By 2013, there were just 343,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Though the bureau projected that the number of welding jobs would rise 6 percent nationwide in coming years, the American Welding Society recently estimated at least a 10 percent jump over the next decade. In the energy belt, positions are already available. Fluor alone plans to hire 7,000 craft workers over the next three years, including 600 welders, just for its construction projects in Texas and Louisiana.In Oyster Creek, Ms. Taylor arrives in time to put out snacks and coffee for the bone-tired 4 a.m. class members.\u201cThe money is what brings them in; a welder can make a six-figure income easy,\u201d said Ms. Taylor, who is married to a master welder.Novices start on a computerized welding machine, complete with clanking steel sound effects and a virtual reality welding hood and kit that simulates the feel of a white hot welding arc without the expense of practice materials and the hazardous shower of sparks. (By contrast, one of the beginners at a community college night class failed to notice the hems of his jeans had caught fire until an instructor who happened to be walking by pointed it out.)A few steps away, two large trailers contain 26 welding booths, each shielded by a fringed red plastic curtain, where employees gather after their shifts to practice welding.The types of jobs that pay middle-class wages have shifted since 1980. Fewer of these positions are in male-dominated production occupations, while a greater share are in workplaces more open to women.\u201cThe chance came along, so I jumped on it,\u201d said Siania Ontiveros, 36, who works as a rodbuster, securing metal columns into concrete, for $26 an hour. Elsewhere welding classes cost a few hundred to several thousand dollars.Lindsey Bernal, 26, is one of the few women here hoping to pass the structural welding test. She started off at Fluor as a laborer and is now earning $20 an hour as a construction helper. \u201cI really just wanted to weld,\u201d Ms. Bernal said. \u201cMy dad used to do it.\u201dEntry-level welders can earn about $16.50 an hour. Experienced structural welders earn over $30, plus a per diem expense bonus. Specialty welders command $55 to $100 an hour, the upper end offered for someone, say, who can work underwater.The share of the American population that is middle income has been shrinking for several decades. Until fairly recently, that was because more people were entering a higher-income bracket. Now it\u2019s for the opposite reason.Jacobs has worked with several community colleges in the area to shape curriculums. \u201cA number of years ago, some programs weren\u2019t teaching students how to flux core weld anymore,\u201d Mr. Marshall said, referring to a process particularly suited for windy conditions. \u201cWe would not be able to hire them without retraining,\u201d he said. Now it is a standard part of the course.Mr. Parks at San Jacinto College said they could barely keep pace. \u201cMost of our students are getting snatched up before they finish their certification,\u201d he said. Enrollment in its welding classes has grown by 75 percent since 2010. Two years ago, the college added 10 p.m.-to-2 a.m. classes to meet the demand.\u201cWe would offer more classes if we could,\u201d Mr. Parks said, but the school can\u2019t find any more instructors.Night welding classes at San Jacinto and Lone Star attract high school graduates with no experience who live at home, entry-level welders who want to increase their skills and pay, and experienced craftsmen from other states who are lured here by the high pay but lack a degree. Many begin their schooling only when their day jobs end.C. J. Molina, a 36-year-old military veteran with four children, attends the graveyard-shift welding class at San Jacinto twice a week.\u201cI want to run my own business,\u201d said Mr. Molina, who works from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. as a welder earning $20 an hour. He is also studying business administration online, paid for by his veterans benefits. He figures that with his own welding truck, he could travel from job to job and earn $75 to $100 an hour including renting out his equipment and skills.As for Mr. Gassett, he started studying business administration at Dallas Christian College after graduating from high school last May, but got bored and quit. A friend of the family who worked at Lone Star told him about welding.\u201cThe first day I was in this class, our instructor made me excited and want to come to school,\u201d he said, after he finished fishing for bits of discarded metal in a trash bin. Then he snapped on a new protective suede jacket and picked up his mask, ready to strike his first welding arc.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Would Lee Kuan Yew Do?", "Date": "2015-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 With China accelerating its military modernization, Russia continuing its slow-drip incursion into Ukraine, and an expanding section of the Middle East devolving into chaos, it has once again become fashionable to argue that the United States is in decline. Strangely, Americans are often far quicker to accept this diagnosis than their counterparts abroad. Although Mr. Lee will be most remembered for his achievements at home \u2014 transforming a poor, corrupt, fledging city-state into a first-world commercial and diplomatic hub \u2014 he was also an astute observer of world order, widely regarded as the Henry A. Kissinger of the East. Mr. Lee was uniquely situated to assess the governance and foreign policies of the United States and China. He advised every American president since Richard M. Nixon and every Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping, who, incidentally, sought Mr. Lee\u2019s counsel when he was about to embark on the economic reforms of the 1980s that have propelled China\u2019s rapid growth. So what might Mr. Lee\u2019s assessment of the United States look like today? As forcefully as Mr. Lee rejected the declinist narrative, however, he didn\u2019t have a blinkered view of the United States. After the global economic collapse of 2008, he became increasingly outspoken in arguing that America\u2019s ability to sustain its pre-eminence in world affairs would depend on the resilience of its footing in the Asia-Pacific. These countries may be wary of a China-led regional order, but they cannot risk losing the Chinese trade and investment upon which their economies increasingly depend. Unless the United States can compete with China economically over the long term, its position in the Pacific is likely to weaken. The more that position weakens, in turn, the more compelled America will feel to take pre-emptive measures to exclude China from its regional efforts, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership; partner with its democratic allies to isolate China diplomatically; or, worst, attempt to constrict China\u2019s rise through naval deployments. Mr. Lee warned that the United States would have to contend with a resurgent China, not only according it a growing role in shaping the norms and arrangements of world order but also, in time, accepting it as an equal player on the global stage. He would most likely offer at least two other pieces of advice. First, the United States will be unable to sustain its reorientation to the Asia-Pacific if it continually allows crises outside that theater \u2014 whether a grisly war of attrition in Syria or atrocities by the Islamic State \u2014 to command comparable priority. In December 2011, a month before the Obama administration formally unveiled its \u201crebalancing\u201d policy, I was present at a meeting with Mr. Lee. \u201cAmericans seem to think that Asia is like a movie and that you can freeze developments out here whenever the United States becomes intensely involved elsewhere in the word,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf the United States wants to substantially affect the strategic evolution of Asia, it cannot come and go.\u201d Second, Mr. Lee would urge Republicans and Democrats to overcome their toxic ideological divides and adopt economic policies that rein in America\u2019s debt, which he believed could \u201cstrike at the heart of America\u2019s global leadership\u201d if left unchecked. While Mr. Lee was certainly no proponent of Western-style democracy, it is too facile to describe him simply as a champion of \u201cAsian values\u201d \u2014 generally understood as putting the community before the individual and privileging order over freedom. In leading Singapore, he was, above all, a pragmatist. And as it confronts turmoil abroad and gridlock at home, the United States could use a dose of Mr. Lee\u2019s coolheaded analysis and wisdom.Ali Wyne is a co-author of \u201cLee Kuan Yew: The Grand Master\u2019s Insights on China, the United States, and the World\u201d and a contributing analyst at Wikistrat, a consultancy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Recovery Is Complicated by a Decline in Household Savings", "Date": "2015-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Takazumi Fukuoka should be exactly what Japan needs to get its economy moving again.Mr. Fukuoka, an art director at a small online media company, has an active and free-spending social life. A part-time D.J., he often buys records in the music shops of Tokyo\u2019s trendy Shibuya district. He eats and drinks out regularly, too.But his salary has barely budged in recent years. So he is spending every yen he earns.\u201cI\u2019m not saving,\u201d said Mr. Fukuoka, 30. \u201cThere are people my age who are married with kids and have their own houses, but I don\u2019t have any of that.\u201dIt is an increasingly common refrain in Japan \u2014 and one that complicates the government\u2019s efforts to revitalize the country\u2019s economy.The country\u2019s savings rate, long one of the highest in the world, is now below zero. In short, Japan\u2019s citizens are spending more than they earn. By comparison, the rate in the United States, where consumers have a reputation for living beyond their means, is on the rise, hitting 5.5 percent in January.The reversal is stark. For decades, many Japanese hoarded cash, a habit that took hold in the years after World War II, when government protections like unemployment insurance and public pensions were scarce.A particularly pressing concern is the sharp increase in so-called zero savers \u2014 those with little or no financial assets, like Mr. Fukuoka.About 40 percent of unmarried adults are zero savers, and 30 percent of families are, according to the Central Council for Financial Services Information, a research group affiliated with Japan\u2019s central bank. A decade ago, the ratio for both groups was about 10 percentage points lower.Like the Japanese population as a whole, Kyoko Inadome is a former saver. During college, she put away enough money from part-time jobs that she was able to move to England, pay for a second diploma, then return home to Japan with a nest egg worth 2 million yen, or about $17,000.\u201cMy money went further than I thought,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI worked a lot and set aside everything I could.\u201dA decade later, Ms. Inadome, 40, a music therapist, says her bank balance has hardly changed. She moved out of her parents\u2019 house only last year.Japan\u2019s drop in savings has coincided with an erosion in pay and job security for many workers, especially younger ones.Many who don\u2019t belong to that privileged group aren\u2019t spending more; they just have less to set aside. Now, there are growing fears about the ability of an overburdened pension system to support them when they reach retirement age.\u201cA lot of people have vague worries about the future,\u201d said Mitsuaki Yokoyama, a financial planner and author of a series of best-selling books on how to save money.Mr. Yokoyama\u2019s most popular books promise to help readers with low incomes stabilize their finances. In the past, his core audience was people in their 50s and 60s who were planning for retirement. \u201cNow there are more young people,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir salaries aren\u2019t going up and they don\u2019t know what to do.\u201dPersonal savings were a main ingredient in Japan\u2019s postwar economic miracle. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the government encouraged people to save with tax breaks and other incentives. The goal was to secure plentiful domestic funding for the country\u2019s expanding industries.\u201cThere were a lot of policies that promoted savings,\u201d said Arthur Alexander, a professor at Georgetown University who follows Japan\u2019s economy closely. \u201cThey\u2019re all gone.\u201dJapanese households saved nearly a quarter of their incomes in the mid-1970s. While the savings rate declined after that, it remained persistently higher than in other countries even through the 1990s.The decline has accelerated recently, as baby boomers have retired and begun to live off money they set aside during their working lives. It\u2019s a vast demographic group \u2014 a quarter of the population is now over 65.Wages for those who are still working have been stuck at the levels of two decades ago. And more workers are on temporary contracts that don\u2019t entitle them to traditional bonuses \u2014 paid twice a year and at retirement, a system that helped past generations to save.\u201cBetween my wife and I, we have two incomes, so I feel like we should be able to save more,\u201d said Kozo Shimoda, 37, a contractor who manages the online shopping site of an apparel company. \u201cBut our savings isn\u2019t increasing, so I don\u2019t feel satisfied or secure.\u201dThe national household savings rate slipped to minus 1.3 percent in the last fiscal year, according to a government report issued in December. The situation adds an extra layer of complexity to the task facing Mr. Abe.Japan isn\u2019t about to run out of spare cash soon. Thanks to the high savings rates of the past, about 1,400 trillion yen, or $11.5 trillion, of household financial assets remain tucked away.And Japanese businesses have replaced households as avid hoarders of cash. In an era of slow growth, they see few investment opportunities, so profits simply pile up in the bank. Corporate cash reserves now amount to about 40 percent of the Japanese stock market\u2019s value, twice the ratio in the United States.One goal of Mr. Abe\u2019s economic program, known as Abenomics, is to get this idle cash back into the hands of individuals \u2014 and ultimately coursing through the economy \u2014 in the form of wage increases or higher returns to investors. The prime minister has lobbied hard on the pay issue, brokering meetings between executives and union leaders and dangling the prospect of corporate tax cuts as a reward for wage increases.Most experts say it would be a good thing if businesses hoarded less and spent more. But Mr. Abe\u2019s aim is a delicate one, because the same pile of savings is supporting Japan\u2019s huge government debt.Naohiko Baba, the chief Japan economist at Goldman Sachs, worries what will happen if both households and companies turn their backs on saving. At the equivalent of two and a half years of economic output, Japan\u2019s debt load is the heaviest in the world. Yet about 90 percent of the debt is held locally, meaning that Japan is, in effect, lending to itself.That is one reason, economists say, that Japan has avoided the kind of bond market pressure that has sent less indebted countries like Greece into crisis. Mr. Baba calculates that Japan could run short of the savings it needs to fund the debt locally by about 2020. After that, it would need to turn to foreign investors \u2014 a potentially destabilizing shift.\u201cOnce we have to rely on foreign investors to finance the debt,\u201d he said, \u201cthat could be the beginning of a disaster for Japan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Adding Good Deeds to the Investment Equation ", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersEVERY two years, the residents of Richmond, Calif., a city long known for some of the highest rates of violence in the United States, gather to discuss its priorities. For years, the No. 1 concern was crime.But things have started to look up in Richmond, a city of about 100,000 people in the midst of Bay Area opulence. At the most recent meeting, Richmond residents were more concerned about blight. An obvious \u2014 and seemingly fixable \u2014 example was the city\u2019s 800 or so abandoned homes, which cost it thousands of dollars a year to maintain in their dilapidated state.Enter a twist on social impact bonds.Typically, social impact bonds are contracts, not bonds as investors think of them. If the group receiving the proceeds can improve a certain social condition, the investors are paid back with some interest; if it fails, the investors lose. The bonds have been used to reduce recidivism rates for criminals released from prison and to reduce teenage pregnancy rates.Jim Becker, president and chief executive of the Richmond Community Foundation, said he had found a way for the city to sell social impact bonds to raise money that the community foundation could use to buy the homes. Local workers would rehabilitate the homes, which would then be sold to people through first-time home buyer programs.A sale of $3 million in bonds is expected this month, pending final approval by the Richmond City Council. That would pay for the rehabilitation of 20 properties a year over five years. And Mr. Becker believes there is investor interest for another $3 million.\u201cThe challenge right now is these properties don\u2019t turn enough of a profit for a typical real estate investor,\u201d Mr. Becker said. \u201cAn investor wants a 30 percent to 40 percent return.\u201d Under Mr. Becker\u2019s plan, investors receive a 2 percent return on the money they put in, and if the project is profitable, up to half of their original investments.While the bond issue is small, it is an example of increased investor interest in social impact projects, a niche that has long appealed to two types of investors: those who want to avoid companies that clash with their beliefs, and those with a desire to put a small portion of their wealth into an investment that could do some good, whatever the return. What has held social impact investing back is the perception that its returns are lower than those of investments without that social overlay.One type of social impact investment is green bonds, which focus on projects like wind power, clean water and sustainable agriculture. There is also a range of investing strategies known as environmental, social and governance investing, or E.S.G. Some strategies screen out companies that make certain kinds of products, like alcohol or tobacco; newer strategies look for positive screens, such as seeking companies that work in certain areas or employ best practices in their businesses.A spate of recent studies and a conference this week worked hard to show that the returns on investments with environmental, social and governance screens were similar to other investments \u2014 in both good and bad ways \u2014 and in some cases, were better when compared with indexes since the financial crash.Certain areas are growing rapidly, like green bonds. Since 2007, about $60 billion worth of green bonds have been sold, according to Marilyn Ceci, a managing director and the head of green bonds at JPMorgan Chase. But $37 billion of that came in 2014. One prediction at a U.S. Trust conference on Wednesday put that amount at more than $100 billion this year.Why do people invest in an area that does good but can be complicated to understand and has a reputation of modest returns? The reasons are varied.Banks make these investments because they help fulfill the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires them to meet a range of credit needs, \u201cwith the added bonus of qualifying for great P.R.,\u201d said Robert T. Esposito, a lawyer at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe. \u201cIf you\u2019re a foundation, you can meet your 5 percent distribution\u201d of assets as required by law, he said. \u201cOr if you\u2019re an impact investor, you must be willing to trade off some returns.\u201dBut Andy M. Sieg, head of global wealth and retirement solutions for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, views this as a chance for retail investors to drive the creation of a new investment category. \u201cWe\u2019re in the early stages of an innovation cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cClient demand emerges. Advisers become stimulated by this demand. It drives product creation. It\u2019s happened again and again, and it\u2019s taking place in the era of impact investing.\u201dHe said Merrill Lynch now has $9 billion in social impact investments, compared with $6.4 billion last year. (Over all, the firm has more than $2 trillion in assets.)Of course, the newest thing doesn\u2019t always catch on with everyone.In one study, 71 percent of investors were interested in making investments with an environmental, social and governance screen, and 72 percent thought companies benefited from carrying out those principles. But 54 percent believed they had to give up performance if they made such investments, said Audrey Choi, chief executive of the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing.Yet in a study not yet released of 10,000 equity mutual funds in the United States over the last seven years, Ms. Choi said, the returns of sustainable funds met or exceeded the median returns of traditional funds 64 percent of the time and had the same or lower volatility.In essence, sustainable funds could perform just as well or better than traditional funds and also just as badly.\u201cManager selection absolutely matters,\u201d Ms. Choi said. \u201cI often say just because you add the word sustainable into an investment, the laws of physics aren\u2019t suspended. If we want this market to really grow, we have to make sure we go into this in a \u2018best in class\u2019 way.\u201dCary Krosinsky, an adjunct professor at the Earth Institute at Columbia, found in research on the returns of 850 funds that social impact investments made with positive screens outperformed by more than four percentage points those made with screens that excluded sectors.While he also argued for the need for expertise in making environmental, social and governance investments, he said a bigger advantage to investors might be to make E.S.G. another factor in their analysis of an investment. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not doing anything wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you do bring it in, you know you\u2019re not missing out.\u201dGreen bonds, for example, seem to be growing rapidly because they carry the risk of the issuer, say, a utility, and not that of the project they are financing, like a windmill. \u201cThe essence of green bond debt is the project,\u201d Ms. Ceci said. \u201cThe purpose is to transition to a low-carbon economy. But the risk is the credit decision of the issuer \u2014 you\u2019re not exposed to the project directly.\u201dLast year, when Massachusetts sold $350 million worth of green bonds, $260 million of that was bought by retail investors. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just investors from Natick, Newton and Wellesley,\u201d Ms. Choi said. \u201cThey had investors from California and around the country buying it.\u201dYet for those tempted to invest, these are still early days, with plenty of pitfalls. If the Richmond project fails, the investors get back whatever money the program still has and the titles to their properties. That is not exactly a double-digit return for tying up an investment for so long.Advertisement"}

At the end of the European trading day it was at $1.1012.Despite the more promising outlook, the staff projections indicated that the central bank would not approach its inflation target of below, but close to, 2 percent until 2017 at the earliest.\u201cThe E.C.B.\u2019s macroeconomic assessment was much more upbeat than in previous months,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, said in a note to clients on Thursday. In fact, Mr. Brzeski added, \u201ctoday\u2019s euphoria was in our view almost a bit overdone.\u201dMr. Draghi\u2019s suddenly sunny forecast may have been calculated. The central bank\u2019s policies, or so-called quantitative easing effort, will be more effective if investors, corporate executives and consumers believe in them. Supported by some genuinely positive economic data, like a dip in unemployment, Mr. Draghi appeared to be using the news conference to give a pep talk that would encourage more investment and spending.Markets fluctuated during the briefing, but stocks and bonds eventually rallied. Blue-chip shares in the eurozone ended the day up about 1 percent, while yields on most eurozone governments\u2019 bonds fell slightly.The monetary policy meeting was the first since the central bank said on Jan. 22 that it would begin buying eurozone government bonds and other debt at a monthly rate of 60 billion euros, or about $67 billion, in an effort to push inflation back toward the official target.The European Central Bank\u2019s lending to Greece right now is 68 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product \u2014 the highest in the eurozone \u2014 Mr. Draghi said. \u201cIn this sense, the E.C.B. is the central bank of Greece,\u201d he added.The central bank\u2019s governing council on Thursday decided to raise its emergency lending to Greek commercial banks by \u20ac500 million, Mr. Draghi said.And he indicated that the central bank would consider resuming its policy of letting the Greek banks use their government\u2019s bonds as collateral to obtain regular loans from the European Central Bank \u2014 but only when Athens demonstrated its commitment to making the economic changes the international creditors were demanding.Because Greek government bonds are rated below investment grade, the European Central Bank must grant a waiver to let the banks use them as collateral. The central bank decided in February to rescind its previous waiver, in light of the uncertainties surrounding the election of the new Greek government.With a note of sarcasm in his voice, Mr. Draghi rebutted suggestions by some analysts that the European Central Bank would not be able to find enough debt to meet its bond-buying goals.\u201cUntil a month ago, nobody had any doubts that public debt \u2014 sovereign debt \u2014 in the euro area was actually very, very big,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cNow some people worry we won\u2019t have enough bonds.\u201dBut the yields of 10-year bonds of eurozone countries all remain in positive territory.Bond buying is a way for the European Central Bank to effectively print money and inject it into the economy. But confidence in the central bank\u2019s ability to rekindle inflation could suffer if the market is so tight that it is unable to meet its goal of buying \u20ac60 billion of debt a month.The policy might already have had a beneficial effect. Market interest rates have been falling in anticipation of the bond-buying campaign. That is making it possible for companies to borrow money more cheaply than ever. What companies save on interest payments they can invest in expansion and hiring.Sweden, where Volvo is based, is not a member of the eurozone, but it closely tracks its monetary policy with that of the currency bloc, and the Swedish benchmark rate is below zero. Volvo\u2019s decision to renew its model line and rebuild market share in the United States was not prompted by low interest rates, Mr. Samuelsson said.\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s good timing for us.\u201dMr. Draghi on Thursday rejected criticism that monetary policy was helping only high-income people who own stocks and bonds. The benefits, he said \u201care being passed in the form of lower borrowing costs in the real economy.\u201dThe choice of Cyprus for the central bank meeting was noteworthy because the country continues to suffer from the effects of the collapse of its banks in 2013, and from a rescue plan that forced depositors to shoulder some of its cost.Some residents of Cyprus expressed their dissatisfaction with the central bank\u2019s behavior by staging demonstrations on Wednesday and Thursday outside the conference center where Mr. Draghi held the news conference.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Optimism of Al Gore", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNASHVILLE \u2014 Al Gore wants to make a point about cellphones, and he has a helpful set of slides on his laptop. \u201cDo you want to see that?\u201d he asks, and starts to turn the MacBook around.\u201cIt\u2019s not two hours \u2014 don\u2019t worry.\u201dMr. Gore knows he is The Guy With the Slides, the man who will talk about the environment until you can no longer remember the color of the sky. He long ago mastered the self-deprecating gestures that let you know that he knows what you are thinking. And then he shows you the slides anyway.Over the last year, however, the prophet of doom has become much more a prophet of possibility \u2014 even, perhaps, an optimist. Still an object of derision for the political right, Mr. Gore has seen support for his views rising within the business community: Investment in renewable energy sources like wind and solar is skyrocketing as their costs plummet. He has slides for that, too. Experts predicted in 2000 that wind generated power worldwide would reach 30 gigawatts; by 2010, it was 200 gigawatts, and by last year it reached nearly 370, or more than 12 times higher. Installations of solar power would add one new gigawatt per year by 2010, predictions in 2002 stated. It turned out to be 17 times that by 2010 and 48 times that amount last year.\u201cI think most people have been surprised, even shocked, by how quickly the cost has come down,\u201d Mr. Gore says in his office in an environmentally friendly building in the prosperous Green Hills neighborhood of Nashville. He sports a style that might be called Southern business casual: a blazer and dress shirt, bluejeans and cowboy boots. At age 66, he is also trimmer than he was during his bearish, bearded period after the 2000 election, thanks in part to a vegan diet he has maintained for two years. In this city? Home of heavenly meat-and-three platters?He smiles and says proudly, \u201cThere are 10 vegan restaurants in Nashville now.\u201dSuch changes, he says, represent a sharp break with the past, not a slow evolution. That is the point of those slides on his laptop. In 1980, one shows, consultants for AT&T projected that 900,000 cellphones might be sold by 2000. In fact, there were 109 million by then. Today there are some seven billion. \u201cSo the question is: Why were they not only wrong, but way wrong?\u201d he says. He presses a button, and up pops an old photo of a young Al Gore with a helmet of hair and an early mobile phone roughly the size of one of Michael Jordan\u2019s sneakers.The same kind of transformation that turned those expensive, clunkers into powerful computers in every pocket is happening now in energy, he says, with new technology leapfrogging old infrastructure. \u201cIt\u2019s coming so fast,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very exciting.\u201dAll of this means, he adds, that the worst effects of climate change can be blunted. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win this.\u201d He pauses and repeats for effect, part preacher and part TED talk. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win this.\u201cThe only question is how long it takes.\u201dThose presentations are exhaustive \u2014 and exhausting, says Orin Kramer, a New York hedge fund manager and friend of Mr. Gore. He attended a training program with some 600 people that was scheduled to run from 8:30 in the morning until 5 p.m. \u201cI assumed there\u2019s going to be a 40-minute warm-up\u201d by Mr. Gore, he says, and then the rest of the day\u2019s activities would be led by assistants.Instead, \u201che stands up there in front of this group of people for eight and a half hours and 164 climate slides,\u201d Mr. Kramer says. Many members of the audience were scientists who asked pointed questions, citing specific studies; Mr. Gore answered study with study, point for point. \u201cHe knew more about the academic literature than any of the academics in the audience,\u201d Mr. Kramer says. \u201cHe basically out-nerded all the other nerds in the room.\u201d\u201cNobody wants that job,\u201d Mr. Hundt says. \u201cWhen you go from being the one guy that says this and that and the other to being the first among equals, to being part of a group of like-minded people, that\u2019s called success.\u201dHis success in the business world has surprised many people, Mr. Kramer says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of him as a business guy \u2014 I\u2019m sure nobody did,\u201d he says, adding that \u201che is a phenomenally deep student of critical forces that ultimately change society.\u201dWhen Mr. Gore is asked whether he will respond to Senator Inhofe\u2019s comments, Mr. Gore calls him a \u201cnice man.\u201d As the first words are read to him, he chuckles, but his smile grows tense. As the statement ends, he sighs and says, \u201cWhere to start?\u201dHe lets out a breath. \u201cThe most powerful advocate for solving the climate crisis is not me, but Mother Nature,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reality of the climate crisis is overwhelming, and more and more people see it and feel it every day.\u201dAs for the senator\u2019s challenge, Mr. Gore says he does not remember the exchange, but describes the ways he has reduced the environmental impact of his home. He buys electricity from a utility that generates its power from wind and solar sources and has 32 solar panels on his home, as well as insulating windows and LED light bulbs. There are 10 geothermal wells under the driveway. \u201cI do walk the walk, and don\u2019t just talk the talk,\u201d he says.\u201cAl Gore cannot ever reinvent himself from the fact that he became one of the country\u2019s most polarizing political leaders,\u201d Dr. Leiserowitz says. \u201cEven as he is trying to explain climate change, he is reminding people, amplifying the conservative response around him.\u201dMr. Gore has learned to live with the scorn. \u201cAnyone who carries this banner is going to get shot at,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I could say it\u2019s an honor to be the object of such ire from those who are so on the wrong side of history,\u201d he adds, laughing.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like a great honor,\u201d he says. He spreads his arms. \u201cI\u2019m certainly no longer surprised by it.\u201dAnother pause. \u201cLet them have at it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Toute La Vie,\u2019 Song for French Charity, Strikes Discordant Note", "Date": "2015-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The song was supposed to raise money, not a ruckus. But because it features a group of young singers whining and another group of older singer-celebrities reproaching them, the recording, made for a French charity, has provoked a storm of anger and laid bare a generational divide in French society.\u201cYou had everything \u2014 peace, freedom, full employment,\u201d the younger side sings. \u201cWe have joblessness, violence and AIDS.\u201d\u201cEverything we have, we had to earn it,\u201d the more senior celebrities respond. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn now \u2014 but you need to get going!\u201dIt was the younger generation that took offense, feeling that in the song, they were characterized as lazy and unwilling to make an effort in life by adults who seemed dismissive of the obstacles young people face.The song is \u201cpaternalistic,\u201d \u201creactionary\u201d and \u201canti-young,\u201d Marc-Aur\u00e8le Baly, a music critic in his 20s who writes for Les Inrocks, a music magazine, said on Friday in a televised debate about the song on BFM TV.The group of older singers and other celebrities, known as Les Enfoir\u00e9s, roughly translated as The Bastards, records a song each year for the charity. They have never been known for breaking musical ground, and this year\u2019s song, while it has a catchy beat, was no exception. Neither, though, do people take their efforts as serious commentary on French society.Laura Slimani, who heads a youth branch of the governing Socialist Party, said she thought Mr. Goldman probably just chose his lyrics poorly. Still, she said, it came across as an insult to young people.\u201cIt\u2019s a little complicated to reproach young people for not \u2018getting going\u2019 when there is 25 percent unemployment among people under 25, and 22 percent fall below the poverty line,\u201d she said.She also noted that young adults do not have the same right to the welfare payments that older French people receive if they have little or no income.At first glance, the French generational tensions appear somewhat reminiscent of those in the United States surrounding the \u201cmillennials,\u201d people born in the 1980s and 1990s who are delaying marriage, extending their educational years and still have a hard time finding jobs.But the comparison is not an apt one, French sociologists and social critics say.The income gap between generations is even more severe in France than in the United States, said Louis Chauvel, a French sociologist who has also worked in America on income inequality and other issues. On top of that, Mr. Chauvel added, the United States economy has been rebounding, while unemployment in France has been rising since 2008 and has hovered around 10 percent for the last two years.\u201cIn the U.S., the young 25-year-olds have lots of opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s generally much better to be relatively young in the United States than to be aging.\u201cIn France, we face a completely different trend: We have more and more educated young French citizens, and they face economic scarcity, even though they have more education than their parents.\u201dYoung adults in France see their taxes going to finance social benefits for retirees that they believe they will never receive, Mr. Chauvel added. The most energetic and smartest among them do find jobs, he said, but often they can do it only by leaving France for Britain, Australia or the United States.Compounding the problem, said Olivier Galland, a sociologist at the state-financed National Center for Scientific Research, is the tendency in France to attach great importance to status. Low workplace turnover means there are frustratingly few openings for young people to break in, achieve and move ahead.Put it all together, Mr. Chauvel said, and the young in France feel not just anger but wrath \u2014 and little patience with musical lectures from their elders, especially when those elders include musicians who have made it and are seen as financially flush.Reactions on Twitter suggest that people of all ages took exception to the song. \u201cMy daughter sent out 200 resumes without getting a single response ... Ah yes but she has #TouteLaVie! Shameful!\u201d one clearly irate parent wrote.\u201cBaby boomers who lecture the unemployed youth that they are so lucky, \u2018you are going to pay for our retirement,\u2019 \u201d said another facetious Twitter message.Some of Les Enfoir\u00e9s have distanced themselves from the song, while others have publicly defended it. Mr. Goldman, evidently surprised by the outcry, posted a statement on the group\u2019s website that tried to strike a conciliatory note, suggesting that the song\u2019s lyrics reflect wider social attitudes and not the singers\u2019 own feelings.Les Enfoir\u00e9s are \u201cplaying the role of adults who answer, as they too often do, by shirking their responsibility and acting in bad faith, but hoping that youth will do better,\u201d it said.So far, though, young listeners have not been buying that explanation. All they hear in it, they say, is an attempt to evade responsibility for the song\u2019s patronizing tone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Imagining 2016 Without Hillary Clinton", "Date": "2015-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical CalculusBut what if the unlikely happens, and she is forced to abandon her planned presidential campaign because of a development we can\u2019t now anticipate? In that case, what would the Democratic field for the 2016 nomination look like?The short answer is: Chaos.Eventually, the Democrats would produce a nominee, even if it were not Mrs. Clinton. As a thought experiment, we decided to imagine a Democratic race without her. To be clear, we\u2019re not predicting such a race. But we generally don\u2019t believe in putting 100 percent odds on political matters. So here goes:He has some obvious strengths. Many Democrats feel genuine affection for him. Mr. Obama seems to be among them and could feel some pressure to support his No. 2. If the economy continues to gather steam, Mr. Biden could also promise more of the same on policy grounds. And Mr. Biden could easily run a campaign that emphasized his stylistic differences with his boss, including his long experience in Washington and his decidedly un-egghead-like persona. Americans tend to prefer their presidents to be different from their immediate predecessors.This time, he would have the chance to become the oldest president to be inaugurated for the first time by more than four years. He will be 74 in January 2017. Ronald Reagan was just shy of his 70th birthday when he took office in 1981.But because a Democratic race without Mrs. Clinton would not be an ordinary race, it\u2019s worth considering some extraordinary possibilities.The Democrats happen to have two former nominees who have remained very active in public life. John Kerry, the current secretary of state, went so far as to consider running again in 2008, just four years after losing to President George W. Bush. Al Gore, meanwhile, has won a Nobel Prize and an Emmy Award and also starred in an Oscar-winning movie since leaving the vice presidency \u2014 all for his climate activism, which would play well with Democratic primary voters.Both men have their strengths. They\u2019re seen as broad-minded policy thinkers who Democrats wistfully wish had beaten Mr. Bush. On the other hand, they\u2019re also seen as relatively stiff candidates whose lack of an everyman\u2019s touch helped them lose to Mr. Bush.Mr. Kerry would be 73 on inauguration day in 2017, nearly as old as Mr. Biden. Mr. Gore would be only 68 \u2014 but also seems less interested in presidential politics these days.But the Democrats have a distinct weakness in trying to find a governor to be their nominee in 2016: The party currently holds only 18 of the nation\u2019s 50 governorships. None of those 18 seem in a good position to win the nomination.If Ms. Warren did not run, Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, could try to claim the populist mantle. And might Al Franken, of Minnesota, be tempted to make a run? He wouldn\u2019t be the first former entertainer.Two candidates who would still have virtually no chance are Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, and Jim Webb, the former Virginia senator. They both may run, even with Mrs. Clinton in the race.Ultimately, the relative strength of these potential candidates will probably matter more in the years beyond 2016. If Mrs. Clinton wins the nomination, as expected, the party will need another nominee in either 2020 (if she loses the general election) or 2024 (if she wins).The older people on this list \u2014 Mr. Kerry, Mr. Biden, Mr. Gore \u2014 will be out of the running by then. And some of the potential candidates who now seem green will be less green.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Asia, Layovers That Let You Take in the Sights", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNarita International Airport is 45 miles from central Tokyo, too far to travel during an average layover. But flight crews have long known that Narita itself is worth a visit, even just to walk along Omotesando Road. It is the main thoroughfare between the city\u2019s transportation center and shopping area and Naritasan, a 1,000-year-old, 40-acre complex of gardens and shrines.\u00a0NARITA, Japan \u2014 Travelers on their way to far-flung destinations often find themselves changing planes at large hub airports \u2014 and at a growing number, passengers with lots of time on the ground are squeezing in some sightseeing before boarding connecting flights.\u201cIt is going to be a growing trend,\u201d especially for younger travelers, said Angela Gittens, director general of Airports Council International, a trade group. \u201cBecause of who is traveling and their attitudes to work-life balance.\u201d Airports are taking notice, she added.In Asia, the opportunities to combine tourism with travel have never been better. The airports in Bangkok; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Seoul, South Korea; Singapore; Sydney, Australia; Hong Kong; and Haneda Airport in Tokyo are new or recently expanded with onsite hotels and integrated rapid transit that can whisk visitors into town quickly and inexpensively.At Incheon International Airport in Seoul, for example, people with one, three or five hours to spend away from the airport can sign up for free city tours. At the eight-year-old Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok, the BTS Skytrain beneath the main terminal takes just 18 minutes to get to Phaya Thai, the government and museum district. The Sydney, Singapore and Dubai airports also have rapid transit connections, so travelers can be in popular tourist areas in about half an hour.What some of the five million people who change planes at this airport each year are discovering is what flight crews on layover have known for years; the city of Narita has history, charm and more than enough to occupy those with just an afternoon or overnight to spend.Dovalyn Hiram of Redwood City, Calif., arrived in Tokyo in early March after visiting family in Palau. She had seven hours before her connecting flight and was one of the first to participate in a new program of the Narita City Tourism Association: free tours by volunteer guides for travelers with long layovers who want to see a little of the area. At the registration desk in the arrivals terminal, Ms. Hiram met Andrea Tran of San Jose, Calif., who had nine hours before her plane left for San Francisco.\u201cWe saw many temples. We took the cobbled streets. We had some food there, took a tour through the park,\u201d Ms. Hiram said, recounting the three-hour experience in the company of English-speaking residents who provided history, commentary, guidance and companionship during the Narita visit.Neither woman had been to Japan before, but by the time they returned to the airport, both said they got a feel for the country. Ms. Tran added, \u201cIt was a lot of exercise.\u201dFor travelers who prefer to go on their own, hotel buses offer service to downtown Narita as does the JR train. A tourist information window just outside of the Narita station has information about places to see, many accessible on foot.Thirteen million people visited Narita in 2013, a combination of daytrippers and overnight guests, according to Akiko Komatsu, of the Narita tourism association.Omotesando Road is the main thoroughfare connecting Naritasan to the city\u2019s transportation center and main shopping area. Along this road are many buildings of heavy timber post-and-lintel construction, giving the street an old world feel. Banners fly overhead and sculptures depicting the animals of the zodiac are poised along the sidewalk.Restaurant chefs stand in the doorways of these historic structures and, with great efficiency of movement, flay and grill eel, a practice that dates to the time when worshipers had to walk long distances to get to Naritasan and the fish was thought to relieve fatigue. The demonstration lures passersby inside for a meal of eel covered with sweet soy sauce and served over rice.Throughout Narita, references to the role of aviation in the city\u2019s modern identity are inescapable. Airline pilots and flight attendants fill the shops and ham it up at the karaoke bars. Businesses acknowledge the industry too, with special discounts and shipping services for airline workers. The Teco Teco Brazilian restaurant features a biplane on the door and is said to be named after the sound the plane\u2019s engine makes. At Jet Lag Caf\u00e9, customers can have a cocktail while browsing the airline memorabilia collected by the owner, Vincent Timmermans, a former Sabena Airlines flight attendant.The fondness the city now shows toward the airport is a contrast to the controversy that followed the first proposals to build it in the 1960s. For years the farmers who owned the land protested, sometimes violently, and there were court battles with the government. The Community Historical Museum, which is six miles from downtown and accessible by taxi or city bus, was built as part of the settlement with the protestors. It memorializes the dispute with photographs, newsreel footage and other artifacts.Many visitors are entertained at the three large and well-positioned runway observation areas, including the one on the fifth floor with theater seats and an announcer who gives the details of each flight in Japanese. From here, aviation buffs and day visitors can watch the constant stream of jumbo jets taking off directly overhead and contemplate their connecting flights.3 more airports near funThe Royal Botanical Gardens lie in one direction while those eager for exercise might want to head in another, toward the Sydney Harbor Bridge, over which they can hike, bike or climb.An overnight layover could include taking a ferry from the quay to Manly Beach, where surfers put on a show all year round, or just for drinks and dinner in one of the community\u2019s many night spots.Even savvy travelers would be advised to take the tour rather than go it alone, unless they have a lot of time to spend getting lost. English is not widely spoken in Seoul, and the sophisticated public transportation system works well but is exceedingly confusing for first-time visitors. Passengers who want to take tours should present their passports and airline tickets at the tour desk in the arrival hall.As a consequence, more than half of the passengers arriving at Dubai International Airport are on their way to somewhere else. Those with more than a few hours between connections can purchase a one-day ticket on the city\u2019s elevated Metro and take the red line from Terminals 1 or 3 to the Burj Khalifa, the world\u2019s tallest building.Getting there is cheap but tickets to tour the building start at $24. Still, there\u2019s nothing like the view of this 21st century desert metropolis as seen from the observation deck at about 1,500 feet. Dubai Mall is just a short walk and worth a visit, even if you can\u2019t fit another thing in your carry-on luggage. The lower level is full of stores selling traditional Arabic abayas. They\u2019re nearly all one color (black) but the variety of creative twists on that theme is impressive.The Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo and the Olympic-size ice skating rink could take most of your time at the mall, but no one should miss the Dubai Fountain, illuminated jets of water pulsing in time to popular Western and Arabic music.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hotel Market Staggers in New York City", "Date": "2015-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetOn 41st Street near Times Square, a Hyatt Place hotel is under construction. The shell of a Hampton Inn sits one block to the west. Nearby, scaffolding heralds a Holiday Inn.For years, New York City\u2019s hotel sector has been growing. But a sustained strengthening of the dollar and a weak global economy could curb tourism, which could ultimately make New York a less attractive market for developers and investors. Rising interest rates could also make hotel construction and renovation too expensive.More immediately, analysts and industry experts are scrambling to explain abysmal January performance for the New York market. The average revenue for available room \u2014 the standard measure of hotel performance \u2014 fell sharply by 12.9 percent, according to STR, a leading hotel research company. Average occupancy fell 4.7 percentage points to 68 percent, and average daily room rates decreased 8.6 percent, to $190.16 from $208.11.For the month, New York underperformed almost every other top market, including San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston.\u201cIt is concerning,\u201d said Patrick Scholes, a senior lodging and leisure equity analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. \u201cI have a pretty clear crystal ball for the first half of the year, and it looks weak.\u201dNew York is particularly dependent on international tourists, the segment most affected by a strong dollar. Last year, 12.2 million, or roughly 22 percent, of the 56.4 million visitors were from outside the United States, according to NYC & Company, the city\u2019s tourism promotion agency.Analysts agree that international tourism will most likely be affected if the dollar remains strong. But a clearer picture will emerge in the summer, since international visitors tend to plan trips to the United States months in advance.On earnings calls in February, hotel companies, including Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide Holdings and Hyatt Hotels, expressed concern about the effects of foreign exchange rates on New York tourism. \u201cCurrency will hurt arrivals in a place like New York almost for certainty,\u201d said Arne M. Sorenson, the chief executive of Marriott.Most hotel analysts are wary of declaring the start of a worrying trend. The Super Bowl and a big convention resulted in unusually strong figures for January 2014, they say, so this year was bound to be worse in comparison. January is also generally a weak month for the hotel sector because it comes after the holidays.Although current economic conditions, including the sliding euro, may have been a small factor in the recent downturn, looming larger over the industry is an influx of available rooms.From 2009 to 2014, New York added hotel rooms at a rate of roughly 4 percent a year, according to STR. Last year, for example, developers added 4,348 rooms to the city\u2019s existing 108,592 rooms. And there are more on the way.Currently, 14,272 more rooms are under construction in the city. Yet demand decreased 1.8 percent in January, even as hotels across the city reduced room rates to entice customers.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any hotel market on the planet where you\u2019ve added so much new supply,\u201d said Thomas P. McConnell, executive managing director of the global hospitality group at Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate company.Low interest rates helped propel the building boom by driving down the cost of construction. Rising rates would make investing in real estate, including hotels, more expensive.Despite the colliding economic and operational forces, New York hoteliers are optimistic. \u201cThe best way to get your money back is investing in New York \u2014 it never fails,\u201d said Nur Ercan, the general manager of Marmara Park Avenue, part of the Turkish brand\u2019s global outpost of hotels. The luxury hotel, in a historic building at 114 East 32nd Street that the company bought in 2012, is scheduled to open this spring and will have 128 rooms, including three penthouses. Marmara has spent roughly $100 million on buying and converting the property.For now, investors, particularly Chinese companies, are still pouring money into the New York hotel market.The Langham Hospitality Group, which is based in Hong Kong and operates a 214-room hotel in Midtown, is looking to develop a second New York property in SoHo, Chelsea or another upscale area. \u201cNew York, in our mind, will continue to be a very, very important hotel market for us for all of our brands,\u201d said Phil Keb, Langham\u2019s executive vice president for development for the Americas and Europe.Still, there are signs that the hotel boom may be cooling off. Because of the glut in available rooms, companies are increasingly looking to turn hotels into other types of commercial real estate, like condominiums and multifamily properties, said David Loeb, a senior hotel research analyst at Baird, a financial services firm. For instance, the Anbang Insurance Group of China \u2014 which bought the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in Manhattan for $1.95 billion from Hilton Worldwide Holdings in October \u2014 said recently that it planned to convert part of the hotel into luxury condominiums.\u201cThe prices you can get for those kinds of properties are much, much higher,\u201d Mr. Loeb said of condominiums and multifamily real estate. \u201cI think we\u2019ve passed the point, given current conditions, where it makes sense to build a hotel when you have a piece of land.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is the city\u2019s second-biggest residential broadband provider behind HKT, which is controlled by Richard Li, the son of Asia\u2019s richest man, Li Ka-shing.CVC, based in London, joined with the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, known as G.I.C., and AlpInvest Partners, a Dutch private equity firm owned by the Carlyle Group, to collectively sell a 64 percent stake in HKBN to the public. The I.P.O. raised 5.8 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $748 million, after it priced on Thursday at 9 Hong Kong dollars per share, the top of the marketed range, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified because the information was not public.This year got off to a slow start, with several smaller deals being priced but activity generally suppressed around the Lunar New Year holiday in February.Now, bankers in Hong Kong say the market for new listings is showing signs of picking up, with several other, larger I.P.O.s, including a number of midtier Chinese banks and brokerage firms, planning potential share sales.HKBN and its backers have positioned its offering as a yield-based play, with the company promising to pay out at least 90 percent of adjusted free cash flow as dividends to its new shareholders. That was attractive enough to lure the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, which manages the retirement funds of 18 million Canadians, as a major investor, paying 1.5 billion Hong Kong dollars for a 17 percent stake in HKBN.Following the I.P.O., CVC\u2019s stake in HKBN will decline to 14 percent from 68 percent.

{"Headline": "In Mexico, an Extreme Race in the Shadow of Extreme Danger", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJosue Stephens, one of the organizers of the Caballo Blanco ultramarathon last week in Urique, Mexico, realized something was amiss when he was warned not to drive along the coastal route because so many people had been killed there recently. When he finally got to Urique, he saw armed men in bulletproof vests swarm into the local police station, take everyone\u2019s guns and throw two officers into the back of a truck before barreling away.\u201cThe craziest part was that there was a woman huddled outside the police station yelling: \u2018Don\u2019t take him! He\u2019s my son! He didn\u2019t do anything!\u2019\u00a0\u201d Stephens recalled.The threat of violence had always simmered in the background of the race, held every March in the Copper Canyon region in northwestern Mexico, known for its great natural beauty, its fields of poppies and marijuana plants, and the drug cartels that hold the local population in thrall. This year the violence finally came to town.Last Saturday, after increasingly alarming episodes involving gunshots, grenades, terrified and often AWOL local officials, angry drug gangs, heavily armed government troops and an incident in which a town official was pulled from his truck and made to walk for hours back to town, Stephens and the other organizers made an extreme decision: They canceled the race the night before it was scheduled to start. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what was safe,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cIf there is any gunfighting, if runners see people getting stopped on the side of the road and abducted, if the military is outside having a huge gunfight \u2014 we\u2019ll have 700 runners spread out over this huge section, and it\u2019s very likely someone will get hurt.\u201dBy Sunday, the organizers had evacuated most of the foreign runners and themselves. Emboldened by the presence of government troops, several hundred people, most of them locals, stayed and ran a shortened version of the course, taking care to avoid places that had apparently been declared no-go areas. But the future of the race, one of the high spots on the yearly calendar for ultrarunners, is in doubt.\u201cThings are up in the air,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201dThe race was begun in 2003 by the ultrarunner Micah True, taking its name from his nickname, Caballo Blanco, or White Horse. He saw it as a way to draw attention to the plight of the Tarahumara, impoverished subsistence farmers in and around the Copper Canyon, in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Long-distance running is a way of life for the Tarahumara, and they are renowned for their prowess.Ultrarunners are an unusual breed of extreme athletes, competing in races that can go 100 miles or longer, often in deserts and other unlikely places. True died in 2012 while running in New Mexico, but the 50-mile Caballo Blanco race has become legendary in the rarefied world of superlong-distance runners, who are drawn to it because of the exotic location and the pure joy they say they feel from running alongside the Tarahumara.Foreigners have taken part since 2006. This year, Stephens said, the race drew about 100 international runners, about 200 people from around Mexico and 400 or so Tarahumara, who compete in homemade sandals fashioned from tire treads. The race serves in part as a fund-raiser that provides many of the Tarahumara with money and food for months.\u201cThe race has come into its own \u2014 it\u2019s a kind of phenomenon, like Burning Man,\u201d said Chris McDougall, whose book \u201cBorn to Run,\u201d about True and the Caballo Blanco race, helped draw international attention to the event and turned True into something of a celebrity.Participants have certainly had misgivings before. Among other things, the marathon route takes them through marijuana and poppy fields controlled by local drug lords (they are told to ignore the crops and keep running).\u201cThis has always been a concern,\u201d said Will Harlan, who won the race in 2009 and who helps organize nonprofit work in the region. \u201cEvery time I go down there, there\u2019s military checkpoints or rumors of violence or previous violence or violence that occurs just after we leave.\u201dThe stories he has heard illustrate how little power local officials have in the face of the drug cartels in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten progressively worse \u2014 police being kidnapped and beheaded,\u201d Harlan said. \u201cAt one point in a cadre of police, the leader was killed and the rest were stripped naked and forced to walk back to town.\u201dIt never got that bad in Urique. But with rumors swirling of gunfire and grenades, of would-be racers being stopped on the road by armed gangs and of local officials who claimed nothing was going on when it clearly was, the organizers canceled the race. Even that led to trouble, though, as Urique\u2019s mayor declared that a truncated, unofficial version would go on after all, foreigners or not.\u201cEverybody was saying it will definitely happen next year,\u201d said Israel Archuletta, an ultrarunner who stayed to race that Sunday. \u201cThe government was so upset because of what this negative publicity will do as far as tourism and the local economy, and I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d ensure that it will never happen again.\u201dThings do not seem to have quieted down altogether. Cecilia Villalobos, Urique\u2019s head of tourism, said by phone that the town had gone into \u201ca psychosis situation\u201d on Feb. 27, when widespread gun violence was reported in a nearby village.She agreed with the organizers that the race needed to be canceled, she said. But she added that she had been overruled by Urique\u2019s mayor, who told her that since the violence had happened not in Urique but in a place four miles away and no one had been killed, the runners would be safe now that government troops had arrived.\u201cWe have great love for this event, which means a lot more than just a race,\u201d Villalobos said. \u201cIt is the single most important and biggest event in the Sierra Tarahumara, and a lot of people benefit from it every year \u2014 transport people, merchants, restaurants, hotels, even street vendors.\u201dEveryone agrees that the situation has brought disastrous publicity to an enterprise that has been mostly characterized by idealism and good intentions. It has also caused runners to re-evaluate previous episodes they had discounted. A couple of years ago, for instance, officials told Stephens that the then-mayor and his deputy had been killed in a car accident.\u201cBut then I talked to people who found the bodies, and they were missing their heads,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cI said, \u2018Hey, they were not in a car accident; it sounds like it was made to look like a car accident.\u2019 But the official line was that there was no danger.\u201dThat has generally been the official line, and for good reason.\u201cIt was always Caballo Blanco\u2019s fear,\u201d Harlan, the former winner, said, referring to True. \u201cThe year I won, the reporters asked about violence, and he said, \u2018Don\u2019t tell them that it\u2019s scary here because then no one will come, and the Tarahumara will be left for dead in a war zone.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone Business Growth Nears 4-Year High, Report Shows", "Date": "2015-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 A measure of business sentiment in the eurozone has hit its highest level in nearly four years, providing one more glimmer of hope that a long-awaited European economic recovery might finally be taking hold.There are still plenty of caveats to signs of recovery, including high unemployment in much of Europe. And data from Britain on Tuesday showed inflation at a new, worrisomely low level.The purchasing managers\u2019 data provides one of the most closely watched real-time guides to the eurozone\u2019s economic health.The Markit Economics composite index of business activity rose to 54.1 from 53.3 in February. An index reading greater than 50 suggests economic expansion, while a number below that level suggests contraction.Doing their part to aid the economy are a weaker euro against the dollar, low oil prices and the recent bond-buying program begun by the European Central Bank.In addition to signaling relatively strong German growth, Mr. Williamson said the Markit data provided \u201csigns of a long-awaited recovery in France,\u201d which he said appeared to be expanding at the fastest rate since 2011.The euro, which has been getting back some of the ground it lost since late last year, ticked up 0.3 percent, to $1.0977, after the report. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone blue chip shares ended up 0.87 percent for the day.On Monday, the European Central Bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, told European lawmakers in Brussels that \u201cthe basis for the economic recovery in the euro area has clearly strengthened.\u201dSome economists were quick to raise warning flags. Hopes have been repeatedly raised since the 2008 global financial crisis that the eurozone was finally set to break into a sustained recovery, only for them to be dashed. The eurozone\u2019s economic output remains below its precrisis levels, even though the United States and Britain have regained and surpassed theirs.\u201cThere\u2019s a need for caution: We\u2019ve been here before,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING-DiBa in Frankfurt. But he said he saw distinctions, too. \u201cWhat is different this time around is the external environment \u2014 the euro is weaker and oil prices are far lower,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a stimulus package for free.\u201dIn the view of Ms. Henry, the HSBC economist, the current momentum is notable mainly because it appears to be led by consumers, spurred by lower oil prices.Mr. Brzeski said that another difference in the latest glimmers of a rebound was the commitment of the European Central Bank. That contrasts with the picture in spring 2011, the last time the purchasing managers\u2019 index showed the same level of growth.Back then, the central bank, under its former president Jean-Claude Trichet, began raising interest rates, on the assumption that the postcrisis recovery was firmly established. That proved to be a major miscalculation, especially as the eurozone\u2019s sovereign debt crisis, which peaked in 2012, was still sapping business and consumer confidence.The European Central Bank began its bond-buying program this month, partly out of concern that inflation was too low in the eurozone. Even without tipping into the condition known as outright deflation, in which the general level of prices is declining, a too-low inflation rate may weigh on growth and stress borrowers and lenders. The central bank seeks to keep prices rising at a rate just below 2 percent, but prices have been declining for three straight months, most recently by 0.3 percent in February from a year earlier.The problem of declining consumer prices is being felt not just in the eurozone, but in the United States and around the world. On Tuesday, the British Office for National Statistics reported that its Consumer Price Index showed zero inflation in February, the lowest level on record for that measure.Mr. Brzeski said that the risks on the horizon \u2014 including the debt problems of Greece, the military crisis in Ukraine and the Federal Reserve\u2019s desire to begin \u201cnormalizing\u201d interest rates this year \u2014 made it too early to say Europe had reached a turning point.\u201cThe ground is prepared for at least a cyclical recovery,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said. \u201cBut it\u2019s far too early to say if it\u2019s going to be enough.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the percentage increase of the Euro Stoxx 50 index on Tuesday. Shares ended up 0.87 percent, not 1.09 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Changes, an Overhaul of Wall Street Falls Short", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe TradeBut do Lloyd C. Blankfein and Jamie Dimon seem humbled to you?So which story line is right? Is banking really changing? Are bankers chastened? Are the banks safer, and has their political power waned? Is the economy less dependent on a corrosive financial sector that extracts, rather than creates, value?And if so, does any of it have anything to do with regulation?First, let\u2019s step back to see where finance stands compared with 2007, the year before the crisis. Using the widest lens, the biggest banks are bigger than they were. Of the six largest banks in the country, three have significantly more assets today: Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Combined, the top six have almost $10 trillion in assets, compared with just over $8 trillion in 2007, according to SNL Financial.It\u2019s true that during the crisis, the government explicitly and implicitly supported mergers. Since 2009, some of the banks\u2019 assets have shrunk, but it has largely been an incremental movement. A different financial reform package could have undone the emergency consolidation that may (or may not) have been necessary at the peak of the panic, but President Obama and the Democrats who controlled Congress chose not to do that.Let\u2019s turn to net income. Revenues are squeezed, but what about profits? Four of the six biggest banks were more profitable last year \u2014 yes, even after all those supposedly onerous, gargantuan fines \u2014 than they were in 2007. Combined, the top six made $73 billion last year, compared with $57 billion the year before the crisis that supposedly changed the world.Hmm. So, what about pay? Are bankers being forced to take second jobs as Uber drivers? Hardly. Pay per employee for three of the top six banks is up from 2007, with compensation at Bank of America and Wells Fargo significantly outpacing inflation. It\u2019s off only modestly at JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.To be fair, some things have changed since the crisis. Banks now have higher capital ratios, which really does make them safer. But it will always be the case that bankers will try to manipulate the system and hide their leverage. Some experts say it would be better to overcorrect, rather than try to fine-tune.\u201cAn engineer doesn\u2019t build a bridge for the exact weight of the truck,\u201d said Erik F. Gerding, a regulatory expert at the University of Colorado Law School.And the banks are still far too dependent on short-term funding. Given that the most immediate cause of the financial crisis was that banks faced runs in the short-term lending markets, this is a spectacular hole in financial reform. (The Fed has been working on it.)Another hole is that regulators haven\u2019t solved the problem of how to wind down failed giant banks. This is called resolution authority, where the banks write \u201cliving wills.\u201d It may be an insoluble problem. Executives have little incentive to get it right. Such a failure might not come for five, 10 or even 25 years. When it does, their bank will be dead and they will be out of jobs. Regulators, meanwhile, can\u2019t really do real-time tests to see whether a resolution plan has been done correctly.So there\u2019s been a lot of tinkering and incremental progress. But the real question facing society is whether financial reform has reversed the trajectory of financialization. For the good of the economy, finance needs to be a middleman, helping companies raise capital to help get products and services to the people who need and want them. Instead, finance has become a money-extraction machine, enriching itself while endangering society as a whole.This wasn\u2019t ever an explicit goal for financial reform, though that\u2019s hardly a defense of the efforts of Mr. Obama and Barney Frank.Nonetheless, are we on the path toward reversing the growth in finance?Somewhat.For about 150 years, finance has essentially charged a 2 percent fee on financial assets, like stocks, bonds and loans, according to research by a New York University economist, Thomas Philippon. That \u201cfee\u201d adds up the total costs that investment bankers, asset managers, brokers and other financial middlemen charge their clients. Even as financial assets in the economy doubled over the last few decades, that fee percentage stayed remarkably flat.Although assets at the biggest banks are up, overall assets in the economy are down since the financial crisis. Because of that, the share of gross domestic product going to finance is down. Is that because of regulation? Or is that a result of the natural aftermath of a crisis, as leverage comes down and people reduce debt? It\u2019s an open question.But here\u2019s another way of looking at it: The persistence of the high fee is astonishing. The higher the fee that finance charges, the less money goes to the economy for more productive uses.\u201cThe fees are too high,\u201d Professor Philippon said.Because assets were rising over the last several decades, the fee should have fallen because of economies of scale. Also, technology should have made finance more efficient, Professor Philippon says. He\u2019s optimistic that the fees will eventually decline.But that they haven\u2019t is something of an economic mystery. Which brings us to the financial industry\u2019s political influence.Without question, banking power has diminished compared with its level at the height of the bubble. Memories of the financial crisis persist. But they are fading.This is where the failure of the bailout and subsequent reforms will come to hurt us. Not today, but during the next boom when banks find it easy to loosen things up.Under the old financial regulatory system, we had offsetting powers and interests. In the 1980s, securities companies would sue regulators when they opened up the securities markets to the banks. (They weren\u2019t successful, but they did throw sand in the gears.) Now that commercial banks are investment banks and asset managers and vice versa, the financial industry is much more of a united bloc of political interests.As Mr. Gerding of the University of Colorado Law School said: \u201cWe\u2019ve done some good substantive things but haven\u2019t re-engineered or restructured the financial system,\u201d as we did during the Great Depression.To reduce finance\u2019s hold on our society in order to help our economy, we will need to stay on the path we so tentatively embarked on in 2009.That seems a dubious proposition for a political system that still allows Citigroup to write its own laws.Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest.

Mr. Sch\u00e4uble announced last fall that Germany would earmark \u20ac10 billion through 2018 for public investment, saying that the money was Germany\u2019s contribution to a plan announced by the European Union in Brussels for an extra \u20ac300 billion in investment across the bloc.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France\u2019s Conservative Parties Show Strength and National Front Gains in Local Elections", "Date": "2015-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHowever, they did not appear to flock in droves to the far-right party, the National Front, although it appeared to make a stronger showing than in any previous local elections, according to exit polls and some early returns on the Interior Ministry\u2019s election website.\u201cThis is the first layer of the 2017 presidential election,\u201d said Micha\u00ebl Darmon, the chief political editor at the news network i-T\u00e9l\u00e9.Exit polls showed the mainstream conservative party, the Union for a Popular Movement, and allied center-right parties taking about 30 percent of the vote and the National Front about 25 percent. About 20 percent went to the Socialists, while other left-leaning parties had far smaller numbers.If those figures prove accurate once complete returns are in, they will mean that the National Front advanced considerably from the 15 percent it received in the first round of similar local elections in 2011 and that the Socialists lost ground, dropping from 25 percent in 2011.Voters on Sunday chose 4,108 representatives on local councils in France\u2019s 101 departments, which are administrative subdivisions somewhere between a state and a county but with relatively little power in the highly centralized French government. Parties could put forward a two-person ticket; if no team received more than 50 percent of the ballots, the top pairs in each district will head to a runoff next Sunday.Leaders from each of the three main parties claimed a victory of sorts. Prime Minister Manuel Valls, a Socialist, said that even if the Socialists did not do well, the total number of voters who cast a ballot for left-leaning parties was the same as those on the right.Mr. Valls and former President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was recently elected to lead the Union for a Popular Movement, or the UMP, called for a \u201cmobilization\u201d of voters next week to defeat the National Front.Mr. Sarkozy stopped short of calling on voters to support Socialist candidates in the runoffs in order to stop a National Front candidate from winning. In contrast, Mr. Valls said voters should vote for anyone who was running against the National Front. He also implored left-leaning voters to band together \u201cand adopt a clear position against the extreme right.\u201dBefore the election, many analysts noted that while the conservative and center-right parties had managed to form coalitions, the left remained fractured. Some French analysts also saw the Socialists\u2019 losses as a referendum on the presidency of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who has been unable to make significant progress on promises to improve the economy, reduce unemployment and overhaul the system of social benefits to make them more sustainable.What emerged clearly in this election is the \u201ctripolarization\u201d of the French political landscape, said Thomas Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, a political analyst. He pointed to the development of three distinct strands: the mainstream right and left parties, both contending with internal troubles, and the National Front, which has gained ground over the last few elections.Nearly half of France\u2019s eligible voters cast their ballots on Sunday. It is difficult to get a clear sense of voters\u2019 bottom line, however, until after the runoffs. While the National Front historically does well in the first round of voting, it has not in the past been able to maintain that momentum into the second round. Although it will be a contender, few people believe it will even win enough seats to control any department in France.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

In the first four days of the 2015 Winnebago lake system spearing season in Wisconsin, his friends and family caught and registered three.Then it was his turn.He spotted the giant fish through the hole in the ice and grabbed his five-prong spear. After propelling it through the water, Krueger, 48, was shaking, realizing his throw was accurate and the spear in place. Later, the sturgeon was measured to be 71.5 inches and 89 pounds.About 13,000 licenses were sold for the spearing season this year, from Feb. 14 to 21. The 1,870 fish taken from Lake Winnebago made it the sixth highest harvest on record.\u201cSturgeons have been around for 150 million years,\u201d said Ryan Koenigs, a Winnebago sturgeon biologist for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. \u201cThey\u2019re a prehistoric fish and were literally swimming around in rivers and lakes when dinosaurs were here.\u201dKoenigs emphasized the importance his department placed on regulating and controlling the annual take. \u201cThis is probably one of the more heavily regulated fisheries in North America in terms of the mandatory harvest cap system in place,\u201d he said. \u201cThe harvest caps are set for sustainability \u2014 they\u2019re not taking out more than what can be supported.\u201dThe department records the size of every fish, searches the fish for tags and transponders, takes samples and determines what the fish has been consuming. This year, the fish were found to be leaner because of a lack of gizzard shad. The largest sturgeon speared this season weighed 137 pounds; the largest in previous years was 212 pounds, in 2012.\u201cThe whole sport brings families together,\u201d Kendall Kamke, a senior fisheries biologist, said. \u201cThe fish is the catalyst of what is a more ethereal event. Nowhere else in the world has this. It\u2019s a sport that is passed down from generation to generation.\u201dDon Burg, 81, has not missed a season in 72 years. When he started, in 1944, there were 30 shanties, and five tags could be bought for a quarter.According to Koenigs, the season attracts people from Canada, and last year, license holders traveled from roughly 20 states.\u201cThe economic importance of the fishery as a whole during the average nine-day season contributes $3.5 million to the local economy,\u201d Koenig added. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique opportunity and a unique season.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Decisions about war and peace, he said, were no longer solely being made by the Iraqi government but were \u201cin the hands of Iran.\u201dOne day after completing a round of negotiations with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, Mr. Kerry met for an hour Thursday with King Salman at the Diriya Farm outside Riyadh.What the United States and Iran want out of discussions over Iran\u2019s nuclear development.He also met at the Riyadh Air Base on Thursday morning with the foreign ministers from the Gulf Cooperation Council, which is made up of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.A broad concern for Arab states is that lifting economic sanctions against Tehran \u2014 the quid pro quo for the nuclear limits Iran is being asked to accept \u2014 will not only help Iran\u2019s economy but also enhance its ability to send weapons and Quds paramilitary forces to support President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.Arab nations are also worried about Iran\u2019s support for Houthi rebels in Yemen and its longtime support for Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group.Seeking to ease those concerns, Mr. Kerry said that he would convene a meeting in Washington with senior officials from the Gulf states to discuss future security arrangements in the region.He also sought to play down the reports of Iranian aid in the Tikrit operation. Mr. Kerry insisted that the offensive had been planned by Iraqi government, that Iran\u2019s involvement in Iraq was not coordinated with the United States and that the role of the militias Iran was backing would fade as the American effort to rebuild the Iraqi army gathered steam.Before flying to Saudi Arabia early Thursday, Mr. Kerry held three days of talks in Montreux, Switzerland, with Mr. Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, which American officials said yielded some progress.A senior State Department official said the goal now was to work out an \u201cunderstanding\u201d by the end of March on what a detailed agreement to limit Iran\u2019s program would look like that.Toward that end, Mr. Kerry plans to meet with Mr. Zarif on March 15, probably in Geneva. Intensive consultations are planned before then, including a meeting on Saturday on Paris Mr. Kerry is holding with the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Data on Health Law Shows Largest Drop in Uninsured in 4 Decades, the U.S. Says ", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration said on Monday that 16.4 million uninsured people had gained health coverage since major provisions of the Affordable Care Act began to take effect in 2010, driving the largest reduction in the number of uninsured in about 40 years.Since the first open enrollment period began in October 2013, the officials said, the proportion of adults lacking insurance has dropped to 13.2 percent, from 20.3 percent.Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, said the data revealed \u201cthe largest reduction in the uninsured in four decades.\u201d Many people gained coverage after the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.White House officials said the figures disproved the charges leveled by some Republicans opposed to the law, including governors who have declined to expand their Medicaid programs.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of dollars being spent by the president\u2019s political opponents to distort the facts about the true impact of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased about the impact that this has had in expanding coverage for more Americans.\u201dPolls show that public opinion on the health care law is still deeply divided, and its future could be an issue in next year\u2019s elections. Richard G. Frank, an assistant secretary of health and human services, said the new data showed that \u201cthe Affordable Care Act is working.\u201d Officials said they were publishing the figures to demonstrate its progress on the fifth anniversary of the law, which President Obama signed on March 23, 2010.Since October 2013, Mr. Frank said, 14.1 million uninsured people ages 18 to 64 have gained insurance. In addition, he said, 2.3 million young adults were covered from 2010 to October 2013 because they were allowed to remain on their parents\u2019 health plans until the age of 26 under a provision of the law.Federal officials said they did not know how many of the 14.1 million newly insured Americans had gained private coverage through health insurance exchanges and how many had obtained their coverage through Medicaid. Many states say their Medicaid enrollment numbers are larger.Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, said: \u201cMillions of people have lost coverage they liked, and out-of-pocket costs continue to rise. Coverage does not equal care.\u201d Moreover, he said, the addition of people to the Medicaid rolls is \u201chardly worth celebrating.\u201dMr. Frank said the estimates were obtained by applying a statistical model to data from a large private survey conducted for the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index. He predicted that the estimates would be confirmed in surveys conducted by the Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The administration\u2019s estimates were similar to those of the Congressional Budget Office. In a report last week, the budget office said that the health care law had reduced the number of uninsured people under the age of 65 by 17 million, to a total of 35 million people. Joseph R. Antos, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-of-center think tank, said it was not possible to say how much of the reduction in the uninsured resulted from improvements in the economy and how much was attributable to the Affordable Care Act.All the changes were measured against levels of insurance coverage in the 21-month period from January 2012 to September 2013, just before the beginning of open enrollment under the health law.For decades, the proportion of blacks who are uninsured has been higher than the proportion for the nation as a whole. If the Obama administration is correct, that gap may be disappearing.The administration estimated that 2.3 million black adults had gained coverage since October 2013, lowering the proportion who are uninsured to 13.2 percent, the same as the average for all adults.Federal officials said that 6.6 million non-Hispanic white adults and 4.2 million Latino adults had also gained coverage. The proportion of Latinos who were uninsured dropped to 29.5 percent, from 41.8 percent, the administration said, and the proportion for whites declined to 9 percent, from 14.3 percent.Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Effort to Curb Immigration in Britain Hits a Bump", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow she has a nursing job \u2014 not in M\u00e1laga, her hometown, but 1,500 miles away, in an emergency room in Leicester, in the center of Britain.\u201cIt\u2019s not M\u00e1laga. We don\u2019t have the beach, we don\u2019t have the sun every day, no beach bars \u2014 but the people are very nice here,\u201d Ms. Martins said. At long last, she said, she can perform the job for which she trained.On Wednesday, the U.K. Independence Party, the populist, right-wing party that has put curbing immigration at the heart of its agenda for the national election in May, said Britain\u2019s goal should be to reduce immigration to 20,000 to 50,000 people a year, down from nearly 300,000 last year.But what is happening in Leicester represents a twist in that debate: Even as opposition to immigration grows, British employers in some fields are actively recruiting workers abroad, saying they often cannot fill jobs within the country. That was the case with Ms. Martins, who was encouraged to come by Leicester\u2019s health officials. They have a two-year program to bring 500 nurses to the city from Spain, Portugal and Ireland, more than half of whom have arrived.And health care is just one of the economic sectors scrambling for workers. Last year, Greencore, a sandwich maker that supplies many of Britain\u2019s grocery stores, announced plans to recruit in Hungary.Greencore cited high employment rates near its new factory in Northampton, saying that not enough locals wanted jobs that required working early mornings or late nights. The response of The Daily Mail newspaper was a front-page headline reading: \u201cIs there no one left in Britain who can make a sandwich?\u201dAccording to the Recruitment & Employment Confederation, a professional body for the recruitment industry, British employers struggle to fill jobs in engineering and computing \u2014 but also in construction, hotels and catering. Truck and delivery drivers are in short supply (partly because of the cost of getting licenses) and shoppers wanting home deliveries before the holiday season last year were warned by a government minister to buy early.For many employers, the solution is across the Channel. Under European Union rules, any citizen of the 28-nation bloc can work in Britain without a permit (except, for now, Croatians, whose nation joined only in 2013).Many people say access to this pool of labor is vital to Britain\u2019s flexible labor market, and crucial to the country\u2019s recent economic recovery. \u201cIt is difficult to see how Britain could be a successful open economy without being reasonably open to immigration,\u201d argued Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.\u201cMost economists think that immigration is broadly positive for the British economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may be some negative impact on wages at the lower end of the employment scale, but even the evidence for that is pretty weak.\u201dEuropean immigrants are generally less likely to claim welfare than those born in Britain and, last year, a report by two economists at University College London said they made a substantial net contribution to British public finances from 2000 to 2011.Britain has recruited foreign nurses since the 1930s, and has exported them too, including to the United States. But Britain is now a net importer of nurses, according to the Royal College of Nursing, which represents the profession here. The group blames insufficient training schools and relatively low pay.More controversial are the semi- or low-skilled jobs that often go to foreigners. In 2013, the celebrity chef Jamie Oliver said that without migrant workers, he would have to close some of his restaurants. Young British workers were \u201cwet behind the ears\u201d and European immigrants were \u201ctougher\u201d workers, he said.Christopher Slay, managing director of Skills Provision, a recruitment agency based in Somerset, in southwest England, praised the work ethic and attitude of young East Europeans. By contrast he recounted the case of a Welsh youngster, recruited for factory work, who responded to criticism by saying: \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019ve come to work just to be told what to do, do you?\u201dMr. Slay said that a recent increase in the number of apprenticeships had improved matters. But he added that jobs involving night and early-morning shifts, like the ones at Greencore, could be hard to fill. \u201cIf you are the boss of a company, are you supposed to shut up shop because you can\u2019t find British people prepared to get up at 6 a.m.?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr do you look for alternatives?\u201dCritics of overseas recruitment come not just from the populist right, including the U.K. Independence Party, but also from the center-left. David Goodhart, the author of \u201cThe British Dream,\u201d a book critical of immigration policy, argues that plentiful foreign labor \u201cbreaks a social contract in Britain and reinforces many of the weaknesses of the British economic structure, such as short-termism and lack of training.\u201dIt was after Poland and seven other former Communist nations joined the European Union in 2004 that immigration became especially sensitive in Britain. Along with Sweden and Ireland, Britain opened its labor market fully to the new countries, while France, Germany and others applied temporary controls to limit numbers.A study commissioned by the British government before the 2004 European Union expansion hugely underestimated net immigration from Eastern Europe, suggesting 5,000 to 13,000 arrivals a year up to 2010. The 2011 census identified 521,000 people born in Poland as British residents, the vast majority of whom arrived after 2004.More recently, Britain\u2019s growing economy has encouraged workers from Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece to relocate here.That is good news for Maria McAuley, assistant chief nurse at University Hospitals of Leicester. The hospital group employs more than 4,000 nurses, including Ms. Martins, at three sites, and struggles to replace the 200 or so who retire or leave each year.It is hard to argue that Ms. Martins is a burden on Britain. Her education and training was paid for in Spain, she speaks excellent English, and she does a job her employers could not fill at home, even though everyone who qualifies as a nurse in Leicester is guaranteed a job if they want it.And while many Britons seem to resent the idea of immigration, they nonetheless rely on it. Without international nurses, Ms. McAuley said, the hospital would probably have to cut back on operations.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to continue business as normal,\u201d she said. \u201cThe risk would be too great for the patients.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mora River Valley Faces a New Battle", "Date": "2015-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOvernighterThere is a shortcut to finding the hot springs at Montezuma. You need only look for people hanging around the side of Highway 65. Or watch for locals hopping the guardrail and inching down the ravine.Nonetheless, I drove to the springs, five miles northwest of the town, and they were not what I expected. In contrast to the usual tony springs I\u2019d seen in Northern California, ones with massage offerings, candles and aromatherapy, at Montezuma you sit on fractured concrete slabs surrounding murky pools. To get from one to the other \u2014 there are several, with varying temperatures \u2014 amid the brush, you practically need a machete.The endless, serene landscape there belies the fact that the fate of the land is being contested. The valley sits in Mora County, which in April 2013 became the first county in the nation to outlaw oil exploration and extraction. Since then, according to the nonprofit Food & Water Watch, 70 counties have approved such bans. In Mora County, the commissioners wanted to be clear, naming the restriction the \u201cMora County Community Water Rights and Local Self-Government Ordinance.\u201d Their aim was to protect water for use in local agriculture and other endeavors; in short, guaranteeing that the rights of nature and people supersede that of corporations.The ordinance was a response to a proposal by Royal Dutch Shell to start hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, here. The company\u2019s response to the response was to take the county to court, claiming the commissioners were robbing it of its \u201ccorporate personhood.\u201d A second case was then brought by three Mora landowners who want to lease their property to oil and gas corporations. In each case, the plaintiffs say their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment are threatened; they equate the ban with seizing property without due process. Whatever the court decides could have broad implications for other municipalities that want to stave off the oil industry.Twenty years ago, descendants of American Indian farming families set about restoring colonial mission chapels, such as the modest yet intimate Mission Church of San Rafael, with its adobe exterior and graceful stained-glass windows. Frank Waters set his 1941 novel \u201cPeople of the Valley\u201d here, and the ambience since then is little changed: Mora remains one of the most unspoiled regions of the state, and also one of New Mexico\u2019s poorest, with more than 25 percent of families living below the poverty line. Somewhat understandably, the notion of possible royalties from fracking is attractive to many. Yet so is the wish for other revenue, such as from eco-tourism.I spent one afternoon with John Olivas, a former commissioner who lobbied for the ordinance, in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains he knows so well. We drove in his pickup with his two children to an off-road trailhead, through groves of aspen and scrub oak, pinyons and juniper and Ponderosa pines. He carried a shovel as he led me across a stream to a stretch of overgrown vines and waist-high grasses.He was on the hunt for ligusticum porteri, or osha root, which takes some sleuthing to find. I wouldn\u2019t have known it if I\u2019d come across it, but while his children scampered and leapt across the stream, Mr. Olivas single-mindedly and as if guided by radar hacked his way through the foliage. After zeroing in on a member of the species, he got to digging and telling me of the root\u2019s many medicinal powers; he uses it in tea to treat body aches and head colds. It\u2019s one example, he explained, of how Mora\u2019s people still hold tight to traditional Native American practices.This land was once inhabited by the Jicarilla Apaches, then by Spanish conquistadors in the 1600s, followed by French trappers in the 1700s drawn by the streams. The Santa Fe Trail, that 19th-century byway, crosses the eastern part of the valley, passing through Fort Union National Monument. For the last century, logging, farming and ranching have driven Mora\u2019s economy.\u201cWe get visitors from Texas, lots of kids and families with dads who don\u2019t know what to do with themselves here,\u201d Brian McGill, Darcy\u2019s husband, told me later. \u201cWe\u2019ve been open for more than 20 years, and now there\u2019ll be another reason to stop in.\u201dWhen the distillery opens this year, he said, the vodka sold will be flavored with northeastern New Mexican green chiles, Salman Ranch raspberries and native yerba buena that grows along the acequias, or canals, crisscrossing the valley.Later that day, I was in the Montezuma hot springs. While soaking and looking up at the castle, I thought of Armand Hammer, who ran Occidental Petroleum for decades while dedicating much of his time to philanthropy. The Mora Valley and its environs had been through successive waves of intrusion and industry. Perhaps another would come. But for now, I was glad to take in the searing and serene vista.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Cyprus Recovers From Banking Crisis, Deep Scars Remain", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA bank branch in Nicosia. For a few weeks in March 2013, Cyprus was the epicenter of global financial market anxiety.NICOSIA, Cyprus \u2014 The financial world has pretty much moved on since Cyprus was briefly the epicenter of market anxiety.Two years ago this month, the country's banks failed en masse, A.T.M.s were rationing cash, and the integrity of the eurozone hung in the balance. But after a contentious, internationally brokered \u201cbail-in,\u2019\u2019 in which for the first time many bank depositors were forced to help pay for a eurozone rescue, Europe\u2019s policy makers soon found other things to focus on.Yet Christos Savvides, managing director of an advertising agency in Nicosia, the once booming capital, does not have the luxury of forgetting. Daily reminders include the rows of downtown shops that once sold luxury clothing brands but now stand empty. At one defunct auto dealership, a Renault Laguna sedan, in a thick layer of dust, is still on display behind dirty windows.Mr. Savvides lost hundreds of thousands of euros that he had deposited in Cyprus banks \u2014 money seized in the rescue program to cover bank losses. Two years later, Mr. Savvides\u2019s experience, and that of tens of thousands of other Cypriots caught up in the crisis, offers lessons that could soon apply to Greece if that country is unable to reach agreement with its creditors.In retrospect, it is clear that European leaders, international creditors and bank regulators could have done more to limit the economic upheaval caused by seizing portions of depositors\u2019 money above the level of 100,000 euros covered by deposit insurance, a threshold equivalent to roughly $105,000 at the current exchange rate.In fact, a new European Union law written after the crisis would probably have exempted Mr. Savvides, since the deposits in his case actually belonged to his clients. But that law comes too late for him and other Cypriots.One surprising lesson may be that capital controls \u2014 restrictions on withdrawals and on money transfers out of the country \u2014 were not as disruptive as feared, but did help prevent even more money from leaving Cyprus. If anything, some economists say, the restrictions should have been applied sooner, before many of the biggest and most sophisticated investors had already fled. More recently, foreign money has been trickling back into Cyprus, including a big bet by Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the American investor known for his appetite for tough cases.Cyprus also represents what many Europeans see as insensitivity in Brussels, Frankfurt and Berlin toward the people like Mr. Savvides who must suffer the consequences of eurozone crisis management. Among Cypriots, the feeling is widespread that as a country of fewer than one million people, geographically closer to the Middle East than to Europe and with a reputation as a haven for Russian cash, they were used as lab rats to test new and poorly conceived policies.\u201cIt was an experiment,\u201d said Antonis Paschalides, a Cyprus lawyer and former government minister who is suing the European Commission and the European Central Bank on behalf of Mr. Savvides and others who say their deposits were seized illegally.\u201cWe make an example,\u201d Mr. Paschalides said, describing what he believes was the attitude of European leaders. \u201c\u2018If worst comes to worst, Cyprus will collapse.\u2019\u2019The parallels with Greece are not perfect. For one thing, the Greek economy, though small by eurozone standards, is more than 10 times the size of Cyprus\u2019s. And banking played a far bigger role in the Cypriot economy \u2014 with assets valued at six times gross domestic product before the crash \u2014 than it does in Greece. In Cyprus, eurozone officials argue, the size of the banking system meant that depositors \u2014 many of them foreigners \u2014 had to share the burden because otherwise the country could not afford it.In Mr. Savvides's case, though, the deposits seized were not even his. They belonged to clients of his agency, Ledra Advertising. When the crisis hit, Mr. Savvides was in the process of using the money to buy local television time on their behalf.Mr. Savvides, whose customers include the consumer products giant Unilever, had to absorb the cost. \u201cThe client says, \u2018I sent you the money,\u2019\u201d Mr. Savvides said in Nicosia last week. \u201c'What you did with the money was your problem.\u2019\u201dThe financial blow, along with the recession that followed the banking crisis, forced Mr. Savvides to lay off several of his employees, who now number 22. Mr. Savvides said his firm survived only because his clients and creditors were understanding and gave him time to make up the deficit.Cyprus, too, has managed to survive, and by some measures is doing better than expected. But the economic situation remains dire.Unemployment, though falling from a peak of 16.6 percent in December, is still above 16 percent. The economy shrank 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with the previous quarter, the worst performance in the European Union.And more than half the outstanding bank loans in Cyprus are classified as nonperforming \u2014 a legacy of the crisis and a huge obstacle to growth.John Hourican, chief executive of Bank of Cyprus, the country\u2019s largest commercial bank and one of the few left standing after the 2013 crisis, conceded that the level of damaged loans was \u201ceye-wateringly high.\u201dMr. Hourican, an Irishman who previously ran the investment bank at Royal Bank of Scotland and was brought in by the Bank of Cyprus board in October 2013, said in an interview that he empathized with Cypriots who believe they were treated poorly by European Union institutions. Account holders at Bank of Cyprus lost almost half their money above the \u20ac100,000 level, receiving stock in the bank as compensation. Those shares have since plummeted in value.Uninsured depositors in Laiki Bank, also known as Cyprus Popular Bank, the nation\u2019s second-largest lender, lost everything because the bank failed.\u201cIn every other country in the European Union without exception this has not been allowed to occur,\u201d Mr. Hourican said in an interview. \u201cIt has caused a psychological scar.\u201dEuropean officials argue that if depositors in Cyprus had not been forced to pay, taxpayers would have had to pay instead.\u201cBurden-sharing with private investors was not only inevitable, but it also significantly reduced the financial impact on Cypriot taxpayers and protected the vast majority of depositors,\u201d Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, said in a recent interview with Politis, a Cypriot newspaper.The same thing will not happen again because of new banking regulations that require lenders to build up greater financial buffers, Mr. C\u0153ur\u00e9 said.The news from Nicosia is not all bad. At Bank of Cyprus, deposits rose in the fourth quarter, reversing an outflow that began before the 2013 crisis.And the last remaining restrictions on transfers of money outside of Cyprus, imposed two years ago, will be lifted next month, said Chrystalla Georghadji, the governor of the country's central bank.While those strictures impinged on the public, capital controls \u2014 which could be imposed in Greece if the flight of bank deposits grows worse \u2014 helped stabilize the banking system, Ms. Georghadji said. She is a former auditor general for the government of Cyprus and was put in charge of the central bank in April.The capital controls \u201cworked and they were necessary,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Georghadji said on the sidelines of the European Central Bank monetary policy meeting held in Nicosia on March 5.Mr. Hourican and others expressed optimism that after a laborious debate, the Parliament of Cyprus would finally pass legislation designed to streamline foreclosures, which can take more than a decade under current procedures. The new law would help banks put pressure on debtors who can afford to pay but who are not doing so because banks currently have little recourse against them.That would not be happy news to people in arrears on their mortgages, of course. But if banks can deal with their problem loans, they should be in better shape to lend to companies and individuals again.\u201cYou have many cases of companies that maybe could do things, but they can\u2019t get credit,\u201d said Stavros Zenios, a professor of finance at the University of Cyprus who is also a nonexecutive member of the board of directors of the Central Bank of Cyprus.One person who is bullish on Cyprus is Mr. Ross, the American investor, who has also put money into battered Irish and Greek banks. Mr. Ross, who was elected vice chairman of Bank of Cyprus in November, heads a group of investors who together own an 18 percent stake.The bet on the bank is a bet on the country, Mr. Ross said. Speaking by phone from Florida, Mr. Ross argued recently that the Cypriot economy had fundamental strengths, including an underexploited tourist industry and potential natural gas deposits offshore. And the Bank of Cyprus passed stress tests conducted last year by the European Central Bank, Mr. Ross pointed out.Contrary to predictions, moreover, the crisis did not destroy the local financial services industry, one of the foundations of the economy. The island is home to dozens of law and accounting firms that serve Russians and others who, despite the crisis, see Cyprus as a convenient place within the eurozone to keep their money.\u201cI was surprised at how little damage was done by the imposition of capital controls,\u201d Mr. Ross said. Because of the country\u2019s network of skilled lawyers, accountants and bankers, he said, \u201cpeople want to do business there.\u201dStill, despite assurances from bankers that they have no interest in evicting people from their homes or forcing small businesses to close down, among Cypriots there is profound unease about what will happen when new legislation gives banks more power to go after debtors.Based on what they consider Europe\u2019s ham-handed handling of the bail-in two years ago, few people expect anyone outside Cyprus to care.\u201cWe feel bitter,\u201d said Christos Phokas, a former bank worker who took a severance package during a downsizing drive and is now is trying to establish a mediation business, helping debtors negotiate with creditors.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Conversation With Rick Chandler, New York City\u2019s Buildings Dept. Chief", "Date": "2015-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 30-Minute InterviewMr. Chandler, 54, is commissioner of the New York City Department of Buildings. Before his appointment last summer by Mayor Bill de Blasio, he was the assistant vice president for facilities at Hunter College.Mr. Chandler also served as borough commissioner at the Buildings Department for Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx, as well as a deputy borough commissioner in Manhattan.  VIVIAN MARINOThis is my second time back in the department. I started as a plan examiner and worked my way up, so I was exposed to the different parts of New York and the history of New York City that most New Yorkers do not get. I\u2019m thrilled about that, especially growing up in Nebraska and coming here and learning about this city.One thing that was done over the last few years, which I think was fantastic, was to split the agency into development and enforcement. I have one deputy commissioner over each one of those two. And then we\u2019ve hired some other folks in strategic planning, financing, and administration and legal affairs. We\u2019re moving our agency toward electronic filing. We have so many parts of what we do that lend themselves to that. We require an enormous amount of filing to show that your boilers and elevators are maintained properly, that you\u2019re inspecting your facades. That is an enormous amount of filing and paperwork for the professionals that do those things. Right now we take them largely by paper. There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t do that electronically. In fact, it\u2019s very bothersome when I walk around the office and see paper related to those things. That\u2019s the low-hanging fruit that we are going after right now.But the other things that we\u2019re not doing online but we\u2019re doing electronically in part is that we do accept some reports by CD, believe it or not. We have an I.T. list of projects that we\u2019re doing right now.Right now about 30 percent of our applications are done online, which is not bad but clearly, by 2017, we want to have 90 percent of all new buildings filed online and 60 percent of the smaller skilled jobs done online. By doing that we\u2019re going to free up some of our staff to focus on areas that we really need them to focus on.The mayor has asked me to be open to ideas and suggest ideas about how we might facilitate affordable housing. My main role is to work with Commissioner Vicki Been and her team at H.P.D., Housing Preservation and Development.We issue well over 100,000 permits a year, and we do almost the same amount of initial examinations. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re focusing our efforts as much as possible looking for ways to streamline it. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Cuts Still Don\u2019t Pay for Themselves", "Date": "2015-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTax PolicyLast week, I wrote about the new tax plan from Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Mike Lee as the \u201cPuppies and Rainbows Tax Plan,\u201d because it\u2019s a plan that includes something for everyone. It calls for big tax credits for middle-income families with children, corporate tax cuts and complete elimination of the capital gains tax \u2014 and as a result would cost trillions of dollars in revenue over a decade.Or would it?If that sounds aggressive to you, you\u2019re not alone: I discussed the Tax Foundation report with 10 public finance economists ranging across the ideological spectrum, all of whom said its estimates of the economic effects of tax cuts were too aggressive. \u201cThis would not pass muster as an undergraduate\u2019s model at a top university,\u201d said Laurence Kotlikoff, a Boston University professor whom the Tax Foundation specifically encouraged me to call.In principle, dynamic scoring is fine. Tax policy really does affect the economy, and the right tax policies can produce economic growth that increases the amount of taxable income. But as the Tax Foundation report shows, dynamic scoring can be misused: You can get essentially any answer you want out of a dynamic tax model by changing the assumptions about economic behavior that you plug into it. If you turn the dials far enough, you\u2019ll get a report that shows a tax cut will pay for itself, even if it won\u2019t.The key question is, will the Congressional Budget Office, implementing dynamic scoring under new leadership chosen by Republicans, be more responsible than the Tax Foundation and other conservative think tanks in choosing its assumptions?(I should note, in the interest of disclosure, that I worked at the Tax Foundation for about a year, from 2008 to 2009. I maintain a cordial relationship with the staff there, or at least I did at the time this article was filed. I never worked with Mr. McBride.)In the case of the Tax Foundation, the optimistic results come mostly from assumptions about business investment being wildly responsive to tax policy. Its report found Rubio-Lee would add nearly 50 percent to the business capital stock inside a decade, over and above how much it would have grown absent any change in tax cuts. In other words, if businesses would own two of something under current policy \u2014 airplanes, buildings, machines, whatever \u2014 they would, on average, go out and buy a third one because of the investment tax cuts in Rubio-Lee.You might think a cut in taxes on investment would increase returns to investors in the long run. But the Tax Foundation\u2019s model says that isn\u2019t so \u2014 instead, it assumes investment would rise as much as was necessary to bid down pretax returns so that aftertax returns were unchanged. For example, automakers would pay a lower tax rate, but they\u2019d make more cars, flooding the market until profit margins fell enough to fully offset the benefits of the tax cut. This assumption is how the Tax Foundation reaches the conclusion that Rubio-Lee would drive an enormous increase in investment.This assumption led various economists to invoke the names of small islands.\u201cThat\u2019s true for the Netherlands Antilles, it\u2019s not true for us,\u201d said Doug Holtz-Eakin, the former head of the Congressional Budget Office who was John McCain\u2019s top economic adviser during his 2008 campaign.\u201cIt\u2019s a model that might be appropriate for Bermuda,\u201d Mr. Kotlikoff said.In a very small, very open economy, the Tax Foundation might be right: Cuts in investment taxes would drive a flood of foreign capital, producing a huge percentage increase in investment. But the United States is simply too big for that to work. The U.S. economy also is not perfectly open; for example, we have some restrictions on trade. Therefore, estimates of the amount of investment created by investment tax cuts should be more modest. Economists also criticized the Tax Foundation model for assuming all that new investment would fall into place very rapidly, and for failing to address economic effects from spending cuts or increased borrowing that the tax cuts would require in their first years.To be clear, Senator Rubio and Senator Lee have not claimed their tax plan would pay for itself. Mr. Rubio was quoted in Bloomberg as saying, \u201cI\u2019ve never believed that tax reform by itself should pay for itself.\u201d While the Congressional Budget Office has not used dynamic scoring as the basis for official cost estimates in the past, it has provided informational estimates of major fiscal proposals\u2019 effects on the economy, showing considerably more modest effects than the Tax Foundation finds, and with a significant range of uncertainty around those estimates.\u201cI worry that, if they decide one way to do a dynamic score, it will seem to some people that has settled the debate over the likely economic effect,\u201d Joel Slemrod, a public finance economist at the University of Michigan, said of the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything definitive.\u201dBut if dynamic scoring is to serve as the basis for legislation \u2014 and for determinations of whether legislation increases the budget deficit or not \u2014 Congress is going to have to pick a point within the range of estimates to rely on. In fact, it already does that by using a static score, which is the same as assuming the macroeconomic effect of tax changes is zero. A zero assumption is wrong, but it is not necessarily that wrong. Some economists I spoke with thought Rubio-Lee would generate substantial economic gains, even if they were not as substantial as the Tax Foundation estimates; others thought any gains would be small.\u201cTax rate cuts in the past have not spurred much if any growth,\u201d said William Gale, co-director at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a former staff member at the Council of Economic Advisers under George H.W. Bush.The crucial thing to watch, in the guts of future C.B.O. reports that rely on dynamic scoring, will be whether the new dynamic assumptions are more reasonable than zero \u2014 or whether, like the Tax Foundation assumptions, they take us farther away from accuracy, and make unsupportable promises of tax cuts paying for themselves.Advertisement"}
