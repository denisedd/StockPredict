{"Headline": "Murmurs of a Shake-Up at Volkswagen\u2019s Top", "Date": "2015-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Ferdinand K. Pi\u00ebch, the famously mercurial chairman of Volkswagen, has once again caused a commotion atop the German automaker, suggesting that he wants to oust the chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, who is set to succeed him in two years\u2019 time.Investors on Monday were trying to figure out how much of a threat the leadership clash could pose to Europe\u2019s biggest automaker. In a show that all was normal, Mr. Winterkorn attended a public meeting at an industrial fair with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India on Monday.The company\u2019s shares, which fell about 2 percent Monday morning after the dispute erupted over the weekend, recovered slightly but were trading down about 1.8 percent in Frankfurt in the afternoon, on a slightly positive day for stocks in Europe.Mr. Pi\u00ebch, 77, raised the prospect of a power struggle when he was quoted in a Der Spiegel interview published on Friday, saying, \u201cI\u2019m keeping my distance from Winterkorn.\u201dMr. Winterkorn received words of support over the weekend from Wolfgang Porsche, the leader of the other family that shares control of VW, as well as the automaker\u2019s important works council, which holds crucial votes on the board.\u201dIt\u2019s disruptive, it\u2019s annoying, it\u2019s the source of a certain amount of tension, but it\u2019s not anything we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d said Philippe Houchois, head of European auto industry research at UBS in London. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk that we\u2019ll get into a phase where all the fighting for position poses a risk at a time when the company needs to be making some tough decisions,\u201d he said.\u201cIn theory, good governance would require that the former C.E.O. not become chairman, and that the chairman not choose his successor,\u201d Mr. Houchois continued. \u201cIn practice, it doesn\u2019t always work that way,\u201d particularly, as in the present case, when the chairman is a major shareholder.The company produces vehicles under 12 nameplates, including Audi, Seat, Bentley and Porsche.Mr. Houchois said that it was possible that Volkswagen would overtake Toyota in global sales this year, but that doing so would mainly be a matter of bragging rights. More important, he said, was the need to improve Volkswagen\u2019s overall profit margin, which at 6 percent compares poorly to Toyota\u2019s 10 percent. In particular, company needs to make more money on the VW-branded cars it sells, he said, and must find ways of better integrating its two truck units, Scania and MAN, and push them in North America and Asia.At its core, the company remains a peculiarly German enterprise. The Porsche family, of which Mr. Pi\u00ebch is a member, holds five of the 20 board seats. Employee representatives control 10 seats, and the state of Lower Saxony and Qatar Holding, which in 2009 stepped in at a moment of need with \u20ac7 billion in capital, each hold two seats on the board.Together, these three main shareholders control more than 90 percent of the voting rights, and each has a blocking minority \u2014 a source of potential gridlock when decisions about important matters need to be made quickly.A vote to part ways with Mr. Winterkorn would require a two-thirds majority.Bernd Osterloh, the chairman of the group works council of Volkswagen and a member of the presidium of the Volkswagen supervisory board, on Friday expressed solid support for Mr. Winterkorn, whom he called \u201cthe most successful automobile manager on board.\u201d\u201cTogether with him we have written an unprecedented success story,\u201d Mr. Osterloh said in a statement. \u201cAs far as we are concerned, his contract will be extended beyond 2016.\u201dAndreas Lampersbach, a spokesman for Volkswagen, declined to comment and said that Mr. Winterkorn was not currently granting interviews. A spokesman for Lower Saxony, which owns a 20 percent stake in Volkswagen, declined to comment.Mr. Winterkorn may have fallen out of favor in part because of the failure of Volkswagen to expand its market share in the United States. Since 2011, the company has produced a version of its Passat sedan at a plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., in which it invested $1 billion.Mr. Winterkorn \u201chas invested a lot of money and the result was permanent loss of market share,\u201d Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen, said in an email. Mr. Dudenh\u00f6ffer said Volkswagen\u2019s market share was a mere 2 percent in the United States, less than Subaru.Like other carmakers including Ford and General Motors, Volkswagen has struggled to make money on midpriced cars in Europe. Most of Volkswagen\u2019s profit comes from its high-end Audi and Porsche brands.As chairman of the Volkswagen supervisory board, Mr. Pi\u00ebch cannot unilaterally fire Mr. Winterkorn or any other managers.But Mr. Pi\u00ebch has a reputation as a dominant personality who often gets his way. Mr. Winterkorn could decide to resign rather than face public humiliation by Mr. Pi\u00ebch, Mr. Dudenh\u00f6ffer said. Mr. Winterkorn \u201chas earned enough money,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy should he put himself through that in the months to come?\u201dDavid Jolly reported from Paris, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Assessing Impact Investing and Borrowing in Old Age", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfSocially responsible investing in its basic form doesn\u2019t go far enough for some people. After all, countless mutual funds already avoid shares of companies that produce addictive or dangerous products \u2014 like tobacco, alcohol or firearms.But suppose you want to go beyond investing in things that do no harm and prefer owning shares in companies that have a chance to make a significant difference in the world.Mr. Allman, who works for Deutsche Bank, and Ms. de Nogales, the head of impact management for Bamboo Finance, a private equity firm that invests in developing markets, have created a how-to handbook for people interested in investing this way.Parts of the book won\u2019t appeal to many general readers. The authors apparently decided to write it for people who will need to justify these kinds of investments to their boards\u2019 finance committees or for wealthy individuals considering buying a stake in these companies before they go public.But those of us who are simply interested in potentially buying public shares of such firms can skip the discussion of things like term sheets, payout mechanisms and anti-dilution protections. We can concentrate on the authors\u2019 solid discussion of how to assess the potential impact of companies and the pros and cons of investing in them.The authors advise starting with a look at the company\u2019s mission. It\u2019s important to understand what the firm is trying to achieve. You then can examine its short- and intermediate-term goals for getting there: How is the organization investing \u2014 in terms of human resources, material and capital \u2014 to reach its goals?From there you study the company\u2019s \u201coutputs and outcomes.\u201d That requires a little explanation. \u201cOutputs\u201d refers to the direct results of the company\u2019s activities. For a health care company in the developing world, it would be the number of patients treated, for example. \u201cOutcomes\u201d is the authors\u2019 shorthand for the difference that the company makes in someone\u2019s life. In the case of the health care company, it could be a drop in the mortality rate.All investments come with risk, but impact investing comes with more than most. The authors point out that in addition to worrying that your investment may fall in value, you need to be concerned that the \u201cthe social mission can impede financial viability. Many social entrepreneurs create business plans that can be viewed as weaker from a business functionality point of view because the social mission is too aggressive.\u201dThey add that because the geographic focus is frequently outside the developed world, \u201cimpact investments often have heightened risks\u201d which range from political instability to foreign exchange exposure.Finding investments that can make a difference and make you money without an unreasonable amount of risk is difficult.He talks about debt for older people but not in the way you might expect. He says many retirees need more of it.While being rid of all debt \u2014 especially mortgage debt \u2014 is often a goal people set when they do retirement planning, Mr. Anderson argues that the idea may make their financial lives harder than they have to be.He writes that paying off your mortgage \u2014 especially if you do so in one lump sum as you enter retirement \u2014 reduces your liquidity and therefore your financial flexibility. In addition, you lose the potential tax break that mortgage interest provides.He goes on to argue that there may be situations in which you may choose to take on what he calls \u201cenriching debt,\u201d by which he means borrowings \u201cyou could pay off tomorrow, but choose not to. You have the money in the bank, but are making a proactive, strategic choice to have the debt.\u201dSuppose you are in the 25 percent tax bracket, he says, and own your home outright. You might choose to take out a mortgage at say 4 percent. Its after-tax cost is 3 percent. If you can invest in a portfolio that generates more than a 3 percent after-tax return, you are ahead of the game.Similarly, if you have stocks with a brokerage firm, you could borrow against your portfolio \u2014 pledging those stocks as collateral \u2014 and use that loan to pay off other, more expensive, debt. If your brokerage loan costs you 6 percent and you use it to pay off credit card debt of 18 percent, you have cut your interest rate by two-thirds.He does not flash warning signs as often as I would have liked, but Mr. Anderson does point out that taking on debt is always risky. Your circumstances may change \u2014 your health may decline precipitously in retirement, let\u2019s say \u2014 making it difficult to repay your mortgage, or the value of the collateral you pledge falls and the brokerage firm requires you to put up more. If you are unable to do so, they could sell your securities at a loss to pay back the loan.Like \u201cImpact Investing,\u201d the ideas here are intriguing, but potentially dangerous. They are worth thinking about, very carefully, before you try to put them into practice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Measure for Measure, Index Funds Rule", "Date": "2015-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesNearly anyone with money in the stock market since 2009 has benefited from the great bull market run. But compared with the overall market, most actively managed stock mutual funds haven\u2019t performed very well or very consistently. But, as many readers pointed out, there are other ways of evaluating mutual funds. Perhaps the most basic is to run a bake-off between actively managed funds and benchmark indexes to see which funds win. As it happens, S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, which ran the other study, has also run these contests regularly since 2002. In these matchups, actively managed domestic stock funds as a group often looked better than they did in the probability-based study in which they performed so miserably. But even in these contests with benchmark indexes, the overall picture isn\u2019t pretty. Most of the actively managed funds performed erratically. In some years, a majority beat their benchmarks, but they failed to do so over extended periods. Like the other studies, these contests seem to strengthen the case for investing in broad, low-cost index funds that don\u2019t try to beat the market, but merely try to match it.The actively managed funds came out on top as recently as 2013 and lost to the broad index in 2014. Based on the recent calendar-year returns alone, you might conclude that the actively managed funds have been holding their own. But the longer-term results are telling: Over the three years through December, the index beat 76.8 percent of the actively managed domestic stock funds. Over five years, it outdid 80.8 percent of them. Over 10 years, it beat 76.5 percent. Put simply, at least three-quarters of those actively managed mutual funds regularly failed to beat the broad market index over three, five and 10 years. This underperformance has persisted year after year.\u201cWe\u2019ve consistently found those kinds of results, \u201c said Aye M. Soe, senior director of index research and design for S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, who has been conducting the study since 2002. What\u2019s more, at my request, the researchers reran the entire study, eliminating the effects of expenses, as captured by the funds\u2019 expense ratios. Even without expenses, they found, nearly all actively managed domestic stock funds trailed the benchmarks over three, five and 10 years. Large-cap funds were the single exception, and only over 10 years.Using a database developed at the University of Chicago, known as C.R.S.P., for the Center for Research in Security Prices, the study avoided what is known as \u201csurvivorship bias,\u201d Ms. Soe said. For example, the latest Spiva Scorecard examined the performance and characteristics of 2,080 actively managed mutual funds in existence 10 years ago. But it found that only 58.1 percent of them had survived in the 10 years through December. The remainder closed or merged, generally because their performance was weak. If only the surviving funds \u2014 which tend to have better numbers \u2014 had been included in the overall fund statistics, the total picture would have been unrealistically bright. It would have been like running a horse race in which only 58 percent of those that started crossed the finish line. If you merely tracked the speed of the finishers, you would be giving an exaggerated picture of the prowess of all those that started the race.In this case, the researchers tracked the performance of all the original 2,080 funds over one, three, five and 10 years. If a fund didn\u2019t finish, it didn\u2019t beat the market. The researchers also found that most mutual funds didn\u2019t maintain \u201cstyle consistency\u201d over 10 years \u2014 meaning they changed the investing style that they had used when the study began. In fact, only 33.7 percent of the original funds retained their style, an enormous shift that ought to concern investors, Ms. Soe said. \u201cFor investors, style drift can be a very big unexpected risk,\u201d she said. Why is this significant? Consider a fund that buys stocks like Facebook, those with a high market capitalization and rapid growth. Such a fund has a large-cap growth style, and investors who hold it might think that they have bought a stake in large-cap growth stocks. But then, say, the manager shifts the fund\u2019s holdings to small-cap value stocks. That may make sense to the manager, who presumably thinks the new stocks will perform better than the old ones, but it can cause a big headache for investors who have built diversified portfolios including this fund. If they know of the shift, they can adjust their holdings, adding cost and possible tax liability. Many people will do nothing and live with unintended risks from a skewed portfolio.These problems \u2014 long-term underperformance, the demise of many lackluster funds and style drift \u2014 showed up in all categories of actively managed domestic stock mutual funds over extended periods. Most of the stock funds in each category underperformed narrow benchmarks over three, five or 10 years. For example, as a group, most small-cap value funds underperformed the S.&P. SmallCap 600 Value index. Taken together, the two sets of studies \u2014 the tests for performance persistency and the bake-offs \u2014 suggest that while it\u2019s possible for fund managers to beat the market, it\u2019s very difficult for them do it consistently, especially if their funds have high costs, which drag down returns.Keith Loggie, the senior director of global research and design at S.&P. Dow Jones, said: \u201cFund cost is the most important single factor predicting performance. It makes it harder to beat index funds, which tend to be cheaper.\u201dSome funds do beat the indexes each year. But, costs aside, it\u2019s exceedingly difficult to pick the funds that will outperform in the future. Whether investors should even try remains an open question.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Leaky Public Pension Funds", "Date": "2015-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMr. Stringer\u2019s office did an analysis of the funds and found that the high fees of managers and failure to reach performance goals had cost the pension system $2.5 billion in lost value over the last 10 years.To be more precise: The analysis found that over the 10 years, the managers of \u201cprivate\u201d asset classes, such as hedge funds and real estate, fell $2.6 billion short of target benchmarks after fees were accounted for. Over the same period, managers of public asset classes, like stocks and bonds, slightly exceeded their benchmarks. \u201cHowever, those managers gobbled up more than 95 percent of the value added \u2014 over $2 billion \u2014 leaving almost no extra return for the funds,\u201d Mr. Stringer\u2019s office said.It\u2019s commonly known that active investment management is expensive, that Wall Street wolves always take their bite, and that they can make bad bets as often as good ones. But it seems fair to ask why it has to be this way with this giant pool of taxpayer money, a pension system of nearly $160 billion that is supposedly run by the best minds the city can find, for the benefit of 715,000 retired cops, firefighters, teachers and others.Even nonexperts can grasp a primal personal-finance principle: buy low-cost funds linked to the overall performance of the stock market, be patient and don\u2019t try to outsmart the market or pay someone an arm and a leg to do it for you. That a succession of city comptrollers and fund trustees \u2014 who, it should be noted, once included Mr. Stringer, a trustee in his old job as Manhattan borough president \u2014 would never have thought of this before and found ways to reduce the damage done by excessive fees, is incredible.He should keep that promise. Transparency and accountability are unusual in the murky wor ld of public pensions, which have seen their share of criminality and abuse. Now that Mr. Stringer has taken up the cause, his next task is to offer ways to better protect taxpayer funds. At the very least, the city should drive a harder bargain with Wall Street, and cultivate in-house investing expertise over high-priced outside management. And it should give city pensioners a clear, honest, easy-to-understand accounting of where the money goes, and to whom.An editorial on Tuesday about New York City\u2019s pension funds incorrectly stated that fees for asset managers over the last 10 years reduced the funds\u2019 gains basically to zero.

{"Headline": "E.C.B. Sees Early Progress From Its Bond-Buying Program", "Date": "2015-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA young woman jumped from the news media seats at the Europe Central Bank press conference and tossed papers and confetti at Mario Draghi,\u00a0the central bank president.FRANKFURT \u2014 Just weeks ago, the European Central Bank began a bond-buying program intended to stimulate the economy and to last at least 18 months. On Wednesday, the bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, indicated that the measure had already begun to bear fruit.The eurozone as he described it is benefiting from a convergence of low oil prices, improved government policy and \u2014 not least \u2014 the bank\u2019s newest stimulus program.A bond-buying program begun a month ago is \u201cproceeding smoothly,\u201d Mr. Draghi said at a news conference, which happened to take place on one of the balmiest spring days of the year so far in Frankfurt.Mr. Draghi\u2019s news conference did not proceed quite as smoothly. As he was briefing reporters, a young woman jumped from the news media seats, tossed papers and confetti at Mr. Draghi and shouted \u201cend E.C.B. dictatorship\u201d before she was subdued by security guards. It was a rare breach of bank security.The central bank said in a statement later that the protester had masqueraded as a journalist, passed an identity check and had been through a metal detector. After a brief break, Mr. Draghi, though he appeared rattled, resumed reading the central bank\u2019s opening statement.While acknowledging that extremely low interest rates could feed asset bubbles or pose other risks, Mr. Draghi said the central bank was sticking to its plan to keep buying government bonds and other debt at a rate of 60 billion euros, or about $63.6 billion, a month at least through September 2016.He said there was no sign that, as some analysts have argued, the central bank could have trouble finding enough debt to buy that meets its standards.Talk about \u201cscarcity in the bond market is really premature,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t see such a phenomenon.\u201dThe program, known as quantitative easing, is a form of money printing intended to push down interest rates and nudge inflation back toward the official target of close to 2 percent. While improvement in inflation will take some time, the effect on bonds has been more immediate, as the program has stoked demand. As Mr. Draghi pledged his commitment to the stimulus, the yield on Germany\u2019s 10-year bond dropped more than 20 percent to 0.105 in afternoon trading in Europe, potentially on the way to joining Switzerland in having negative long-term yields.The newness of the bond-buying program has not stopped some economists from urging the European Central Bank to start planning how to taper its purchases \u2014 as the Federal Reserve is already doing in the United States.On Wednesday, economists at Allianz, a large German insurer, called on the central bank to establish benchmarks for scaling back its bond buying. As inflation picks up, the bank should cut its purchases to avoid negative side effects, the Allianz economists said.\u201cThe program has substantial effects on financial markets,\u201d Michael Heise, the chief economist at Allianz, said in a meeting with several reporters on Wednesday. \u201cThe E.C.B. has to confront the question of whether it should have some flexibility built into the program.\u201dMr. Draghi batted away suggestions that the central bank should already be discussing how to back out of bond buying.\u201cWe\u2019ve been in this program only a month,\u201d Mr. Draghi said, invoking a simile on running. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking yourself after 1K, are you going to finish this marathon?\u201dHe acknowledged that central bank intervention in debt markets, which have pushed the market interest rates on many government bonds into negative territory, comes with risks.\u201cWe are aware that very low interest rates for a very long time are fertile terrain for financial stability imbalances,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cHaving said that, we don\u2019t see at this point in time evidence of systemically large financial imbalances.\u201dThe central bank could deal with any risks by using its power as a bank regulator, he said, not by changing monetary policy. Eurozone banks are in much better shape than they were three years ago, he added, so that borrowers are finally benefiting from the cheap cash the central bank makes available to commercial lenders.\u201cMore accommodative monetary policy is being translated into better credit conditions,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is not something we have seen before.\u201dMr. Draghi noted that financial forecasters had followed the lead of the E.C.B. as it raised its economic growth expectation for 2015, predicting it will accelerate to 1.5 percent from an earlier forecast of 1 percent.While government borrowing costs continued to drop, stocks on Wednesday were little changed, rising by 0.5 percent. The euro, which has fallen sharply against the dollar in recent months, was down slightly to about $1.06.The central bank also left its main interest rate unchanged at a low of 0.05 percent. As a policy tool, it has been all but eclipsed by the so-called quantitative easing program that the central bank began in March.Some economists are hesitant to give too much credit to the European Central Bank for recent growth. The economy has also benefited from low fuel prices and a steep fall in the value of the euro, which bolsters exports by making products from the eurozone less expensive for customers paying in dollars and other major currencies.Cheap fuel and a weak euro will most likely be temporary, and economists have warned that the recovery could be short-lived unless eurozone countries do more to create permanent conditions for faster growth, for example by loosening rigid labor regulations.\u201cThe risk is great that if these conditions turn around, there would be a big drop in growth,\u201d Mr. Heise of Allianz said. \u201cThe economy is not yet self-sustaining.\u201dMr. Draghi said that, while governments have made progress in improving business conditions, they should take advantage of favorable conditions now to do more, for example making it easier for companies to hire and fire.\u201cOur monetary policy finds its natural complement in structural reforms,\u201d he said.Mr. Draghi did not appear overly concerned that Greece\u2019s financial condition is an imminent threat to the stability of the eurozone. The European Central Bank plays a crucial role because it controls the flow of emergency lending to Greek banks, without which some would probably collapse.The E.C.B. has taken a hard line with the government of Greece but has avoided a bigger crisis by providing a drip feed of cash to Greek banks. European Central Bank lending to Greek banks has reached \u20ac110 billion, Mr. Draghi said, more than any other eurozone country in terms of the proportion to the size of the economy.Mr. Draghi said the central bank would continue to support Greek banks. But he emphasized that it was up to political leaders to resolve an impasse over the terms of European Union loans to the Athens government.\u201cIt\u2019s entirely in the hands of the Greek government,\u201d he said, \u201cand the negotiations that are taking place between the Greek government and the euro area members.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In Jewish midrash, the Just eat pomegranate seeds, which by legend number 613, in correspondence to the 613 good deeds ordered by God\u2019s oldest law. Which is to say, ghoulish binges aside, the story of mankind eating seed has been a noble one.The most magical of the seed\u2019s confectionary incarnations must be the Middle Eastern halvah \u2014 ground sesame seeds and honey. It remains the only dessert that has ever matched my childhood fantasy of what confections in stories were in real life. (I read of Turkish delight hungrily in C.\u2009S. Lewis, tasting halvah in my mind, and held onto the invention until I first tasted actual Turkish delight, a bland flabby jelly, in the Istanbul Spice Market at 20. I was disappointed, but grateful for all the years of innocence.)On the savory side, there is Dukkah, which is mostly Egyptian but echoed in Japan. It combines some mix of coriander seed, cumin seed, sesame seed, fennel seed, dried thyme and salt and finely chopped Mediterranean nuts. An Egyptian book of manners and customs from 1860 advises readers to make Dukkah whenever more elaborate delicacies are impossible, by mixing together seeds and salt, then to dip pieces of bread directly into it, so that every bite of that honest baked dough comes alive with the nutty and fragrant improvements. Gomashio, used for dabbing on bowls of rice in the islands of Japan, is sesame seeds mixed with salt; it creates a whirl of contrasts, whether for porridge or an omelet or a bowl of cooked spinach.Even just a simple handful of toasted seeds, sprinkled on anything simple or plain, will give the dish beneath something of a seed\u2019s deep native power. If there are only a few plain vegetables, or bread, or any animal, vegetable or mineral that has held up through the cold nights, a seed, once sown over the top, will help it bloom.Would I have been as brave as the St. Petersburg scientists, inspired by their master, the devoted Vavilov, who had collected the seeds himself and suffered his own hard fate in the Soviet gulag? Or would I have done \u2014 in my famished mind \u2014 a willful misreading of that question attributed to Seneca: \u201cWhen shall we live if not now?\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Fines Bank of New York Mellon $185 Million for Compliance Failures", "Date": "2015-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 British regulators on Wednesday fined Bank of New York Mellon 126 million pounds, or about $185 million, for failing to comply with rules intended to protect client assets if the bank were ever to become insolvent.The Financial Conduct Authority of Britain, or F.C.A., said that Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s London branch and its Bank of New York Mellon International unit failed to keep so-called entity-specific records for accounts in which it was acting as a custodian.The regulator faulted the bank for how it recorded information about its clients, including failing to record the actual legal entity identified in each client contract. As a result, it may have been harder to identify the owner of assets in the event of insolvency, the regulator said. The failure to comply with custody rules occurred between November 2007 and August 2013, the Financial Conduct Authority said.As part of its business as a custodian bank, Bank of New York Mellon holds a variety of assets and securities for clients \u2014 either directly or through a network of custodians. This includes physical certificates for some securities, like bearer bonds, held in vaults in Britain and the United States.The two units held custody assets for more than 6,000 clients based in Britain and had more than \u00a31.5 trillion in combined custody assets at their peak during the period at issue, the Financial Conduct Authority said. As a result, the two Bank of New York Mellon units are considered \u201csystemically important\u201d to the British market, the regulator said.\u201cHad the firms become insolvent, the total value of safe custody assets at risk would have been significant,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is compounded by the fact that the breaches took place at a time when there was considerable stress in the market.\u201dThe Financial Conduct Authority said that it considered the failures by the Bank of New York Mellon units to be serious but that it did not find their actions to be deliberate or reckless. The regulator also said that no client assets were lost as a result.Bank of New York Mellon settled at an early stage of the investigation. Otherwise, it would have faced a fine as high as \u00a3180 million. The failings were primarily identified by the Financial Conduct Authority as part of a regular review of the Bank of New York Mellon units, the regulator said.Bank of New York Mellon said that it had \u201cworked cooperatively\u201d with the Financial Conduct Authority to resolve the issues identified by the regulator and had undertaken a broad internal review to improve its policies and procedures to comply with the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s custody rules.\u201cBNY Mellon is very mindful of the importance of safeguarding client assets and has been trusted by its clients to do so for 230 years,\u201d the bank said in a news release on Wednesday. \u201cWe regret in this case that we did not meet our standards or those of the F.C.A. As always, regulatory compliance remains a key area of focus as we maintain our track record of safety and soundness as a financial institution.\u201dThe regulator said it also found that the Bank of New York Mellon units, in some cases, failed to prevent the mixing of custody assets with firm assets held in proprietary accounts and, on occasion, used custody assets held jointly in omnibus accounts to settle other clients\u2019 transactions without prior consent from all clients whose assets were held in those accounts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Frees Up $200 Billion for Lending to Stimulate Economy", "Date": "2015-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese policy makers are dealing with a financial conundrum. Overall economic growth is slipping, which argues for looser monetary policy. But the risk is that any new money is diverted to the country\u2019s frothy stock markets.Against this backdrop, the central bank and securities regulator appear to be taking coordinated action.In combination, the policies could help direct more of the new lending into productive sectors of the economy, while reducing the chance that the money further fuels the stock market.Policy makers are responding to the slowing economy. Figures released last week showed the growth rate had decelerated to 7 percent in the first quarter, its slowest pace in six years.\u201cThe move was widely expected, given last week\u2019s weak data releases,\u201d Qu Hongbin, an economist at HSBC in Hong Kong, wrote Sunday in a research note. \u201cHowever, the magnitude of the cut \u2014 the largest since November 2008 \u2014 signals Beijing\u2019s heightened concerns over the growth slowdown,\u201d he said. Mr. Qu calculates the move could free 1.2 trillion renminbi, or around $200 billion, for new lending.Still, the cut does not automatically translate into new lending. China\u2019s banks have grown wary of issuing loans to smaller or riskier borrowers, given the country\u2019s slowing growth. And the banks\u2019 profitability has come under pressure as Beijing has pursued financial overhauls, including steps toward full liberalization of interest rates.Most analysts expect that China will, in the coming months, make further reductions to reserve requirements for banks and to benchmark interest rates. But doubts remain over whether these steps will be enough to achieve the official target of about 7 percent growth for the full year.Despite easing moves so far, China\u2019s slowing growth has meant that Beijing has been confronted by \u201crising skepticism about the ability of the government to generate an economic recovery as it typically did in the past,\u201d Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note on Sunday.The new rate reduction, and lower overall borrowing costs in recent weeks, \u201cmarks a new stage in policy making with a more aggressive stance,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe believe other loosening measures are likely to become more aggressive as well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Paying for Financial Advice Makes Sense", "Date": "2015-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyIf you are lucky to earn more money than you need each month, there was probably a time when you could have used some advice about how best to spend, save and protect it.But if you looked around for a big national firm that swore to do the right thing, you would not have found it. Doing it right means putting your interests first, investing in index funds or similar investments, making money only through reasonable fees and not commissions earned from pushing complex life insurance policies, and talking to you in depth about your entire financial life and your goals and dreams.That brings up two questions: Why is it so hard for any start-up or established company to provide the right kind of financial planning to large numbers of people? And what is so wrong with all of us that we are unwilling to pay for the good stuff when it is being offered?Traditional brokerage firms once made plenty of money through commissions that paid their financial professionals over the many years that clients held onto certain mutual funds. This was often quite bad for the clients, since those commissions were paid for with high fees that came out of their annual returns. It was doubly bad when the funds almost inevitably underperformed basic stock indexes like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500.Meanwhile, insurance agents sold those messy annuities or investments wrapped in complicated life insurance policies. Here, too, the salespeople drew handsome compensation, but the customers would often have been better off buying some cheap index funds and holding them for decades while purchasing some simple term life insurance on the side for $50 a month.Customers and financial advisers who saw the light sensed that the best way for consumers to pay for advice was to hand over money directly to the advice giver, perhaps on an hourly or monthly basis or by paying 1 percent of their assets each year. But as LearnVest has now proved, even at a superlow price, it\u2019s hard to get enough people to do that to build a big company.So what is so hard about talking people into it? Admitting that you need help is hard. There is shame in having gotten money wrong so far, or shame that you can\u2019t figure it out or shame that it\u2019s taken so long to start.The industry, with all its various conflicts and bad actors, doesn\u2019t do itself any favors either. \u201cWoe to us and our profession that we\u2019ve made it so hard,\u201d Mr. Kitces said. \u201cOur standards are so low that we\u2019ve brought this upon ourselves.\u201dWhat won me over to paying for financial planning wasn\u2019t any lack of knowledge but a lack of time. As 2008 ended with the markets in free-fall, I knew I should sell some bonds and buy some more stocks to rebalance the various household retirement accounts. But it was going to be such a chore, and I was busy trying to figure out what was going on so I could write about it and calm people down. I didn\u2019t ever make the time, and had I bought more stock at the bottom, it would have made an appreciable difference in our retirement balances today, let alone 30 years from now.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fueled by Market Rally in China, GF Securities Raises $3.6 Billion in I.P.O.", "Date": "2015-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Ordinary Chinese investors are doubling down on stocks, pushing the Shanghai market to seven-year highs \u2014 and their brokers are cashing in.The securities companies that have facilitated the stock market boom are capitalizing on their own ballooning share prices by issuing huge amounts of new stock, raising billions of dollars in the process.On Tuesday, GF Securities, one of China\u2019s biggest brokerage firms, raised $3.6 billion in an initial public offering in Hong Kong, the biggest new listing in Asia so far this year.Earlier in March, Orient Securities, Citigroup\u2019s brokerage partner in mainland China, raised $1.6 billion in a Shanghai listing. And in February, shareholders of Haitong Securities, another big Chinese brokerage firm, approved its plan to raise $3.9 billion by selling additional shares in Hong Kong.The problem with bubbles is anticipating how much they can swell before bursting. Chinese investors appear to be making a counterintuitive bet that a slowing economy is good for markets because it will prompt the leadership in Beijing to respond with measures to stimulate growth. On Monday, in an effort to bolster the slumping housing market, the central bank lowered the minimum down payment on mortgages for second homes to 40 percent, from 60 percent or 70 percent previously, causing a surge in real estate shares.\u201cThe sharp drop-off in economic activity since the start of the year, along with lower inflation, will encourage greater action from the People\u2019s Bank of China over the coming months,\u201d Chang Liu, a China economist at Capital Economics, wrote Tuesday in a research report, referring to the central bank. \u201cThis will most likely push equities even higher this year,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, with markets increasingly divorced from economic fundamentals, we expect a partial reversal of these gains in 2016.\u201dShanghai\u2019s benchmark share index was the best performer in the world last year. And since Nov. 21, when the central bank began its current cycle of easing monetary policy by cutting interest rates, Shanghai stocks have risen 50 percent. On Monday, the index rose to 3,786.6 points, a level not seen since early 2008, before the financial crisis. Shares slipped 1 percent lower on Tuesday.The surge is precarious because it is increasingly being driven by ordinary investors. According to Tom Orlik, a Bloomberg economist, the results of a recent investment survey conducted by a Chinese university showed that two-thirds of all new investors in China\u2019s stock markets had completed only the equivalent of elementary or junior high school before leaving school. That compared with a dropout rate of about a quarter among existing investors. The survey was conducted at the end of last year by the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, in Sichuan Province, and covered 4,000 households across the country.But markets have since recovered, and borrowing from brokerage firms continues to fuel the increase. Outstanding margin financing has risen to more than 1.4 trillion renminbi, or about $230 billion, up from about 1 trillion renminbi at the start of the year.That has been good news to brokerage firms, whose own shares are among the best performers in the rally. GF Securities, which is already listed in China\u2019s secondary market based in Shenzhen, was able to price its Hong Kong I.P.O. on Tuesday at 18.85 Hong Kong dollars per share, at the top of the marketed price range, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified because the information was not yet public.The company raised 27.9 billion Hong Kong dollars, or about $3.6 billion. That ranks as the second-biggest I.P.O. globally this year, after that of the Spanish airport operator Aena, which raised around $4.8 billion in a listing in Madrid in February, according to data from the financial information provider Dealogic.GF Securities shares are scheduled to begin trading on April 10.GF Capital, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bocom International, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch unit were the lead underwriters of the listing and were among the 22 banks involved in marketing the deal.An earlier version of this article misstated the nature of Haitong Securities\u2019 share sale. Shareholders approved the company\u2019s plan to sell $3.9 billion worth of additional shares; they did not raise that amount of money selling additional shares.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Private Eyes in the Grocery Aisles", "Date": "2015-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMansour Samadpour makes his way through the supermarket like a detective working a crime scene, slow, watchful, up one aisle and down the next. A clerk mistakenly assumes that he needs help, but Mr. Samadpour brushes him off. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing.He buys organic raspberries that might test positive for pesticides and a fillet of wild-caught fish that might be neither wild nor the species listed on the label. He buys beef and pork ground fresh at the market. He is disappointed that there is no caviar, which might turn out to be something cheaper than sturgeon roe. That\u2019s an easy case to crack.While he\u2019s out of the office, he receives a call and dispatches a team on a more pressing expedition: They need to buy various products that contain cumin, because a client just found possible evidence of peanuts, a powerful allergen, in a cumin-based spice mix. The client wants a definitive answer before someone gets sick.Suppliers, manufacturers and markets depend on Mr. Samadpour\u2019s network of labs to test food for inadvertent contamination and deliberate fraud, or to verify if a product is organic or free of genetically modified organisms. Consumers, the last link in the chain, bet their very health on responsible practices along the way.The annual cost of food-borne illnesses in the United States is $14.1 billion to $16.3 billion, according to a 2013 analysis by the Agriculture Department. The federal government has called for a shift from reaction, which usually means a large recall after people have fallen ill or died, to prevention, to reduce the number of such episodes. Wary customers want their food to be safe and genuine, and food retailers, who rely on a global array of suppliers, are looking for ways to protect their brands.Food testing sits at the intersection of those desires. Mr. Samadpour, who opened IEH\u2019s first lab in 2001 with six employees, now employs over 1,500 people at 116 labs in the United States and Europe. He refers to his company, one of the largest of its kind in the country, as \u201ca privately financed public health organization.\u201dThe Promise of DNA TestsThe two low-slung wooden buildings that house IEH\u2019s labs at its base in Seattle feel more like a high school chemistry lab than the center of a national food security network; there\u2019s an acrid smell, and the counters are crammed with vials of various shapes and colors, centrifuge machines and lined notebooks full of data entries.This is where analysts coax DNA out of a tiny sample of whatever is being tested. For lethal threats, like E. coli O157 in ground beef, the detection process involves a grim recipe of ground beef and a broth infused with nutrients that E. coli likes to eat, put in a warm place to rest for 10 hours \u2014 at which point a single E. coli cell, if it exists, will have spawned one million easy-to-detect siblings. For fraud cases, the process is somewhat simpler; lab technicians run a DNA test or chemical analysis to confirm a sample\u2019s identity.Cheap technology has made this kind of testing possible. \u201cTen years ago, it would have taken millions of dollars to sequence a genome,\u201d Mr. Samadpour says. \u201cNow it takes $100. We do thousands a year.\u201dWhile the lab focuses primarily on safety issues like the cumin-and-peanut inquiry, there are enough fraud calls to support specialties among the lab technicians, like Kirthi Kutumbaka, referred to by his colleagues as \u201cthe emperor of fish\u201d for his work on a seafood identification project. Once a fish is filleted, genetic testing is the only way to confirm its identity, making it a popular category for fraud.IEH\u2019s clients are primarily vendors who supply retailers and manufacturers, and they generally prefer to remain anonymous for fear of indicating to consumers that they have a specific worry about safety.Costco is one of the retailers that use IEH\u2019s services, and the company doesn\u2019t mind talking about it.\u201cWe have to inspect what we expect,\u201d says Craig Wilson, the company\u2019s vice president for quality assurance and food safety, meaning that products have to live up to their labels, particularly items in Costco\u2019s own Kirkland Signature line.Costco has a smaller margin of error than most food retailers; the company stocks only about 3,500 so-called S.K.U.s, or stock keeping units, while most retailers offer as many as 150,000. A single misstep is a far greater percentage of the whole. That\u2019s why, in addition to retaining IEH, it operates its own 20-person testing lab.\u201cWe\u2019re not typical,\u201d Mr. Wilson says. \u201cWe have one ketchup, one mayonnaise, one can of olives, Kirkland Signature olive oils and a couple of others.\u201d Since 2003, the United States Department of Agriculture has required the testing of beef used for ground beef, resulting in a 40 percent reduction in cases of E. coli traced to beef consumption. Costco, which processes 600,000 to 700,000 pounds of ground beef daily, does extensive micro-sampling of the meat at its California facility, Mr. Wilson says.The company expects its suppliers to absorb testing costs and gets no resistance, given the size of the resulting orders. Costco sells 157,000 rotisserie chickens a day. As Mr. Wilson put it: \u201cIf vendors get a bill for a couple hundred bucks on a $1 million order, who cares? They don\u2019t.\u201dThe sheer volume also enables Costco to demand action when there is a problem. After a 2006 outbreak of E. coli tied to Earthbound Farm\u2019s ready-to-eat bagged spinach, in which three people died and more than 200 became ill, Mr. Wilson, one of Earthbound\u2019s customers, instituted what he calls a \u201cbag and hold\u201d program for all of Costco\u2019s fresh greens suppliers. He required the suppliers to test their produce and not ship it until they had the results of the tests.Earthbound responded to the outbreak with a \u201cmultihurdle program that places as many barriers to food-borne illness as we can,\u201d says Gary Thomas, the company\u2019s senior vice president for integrated supply chain. Earthbound now conducts 200,000 tests annually on its ready-to-eat greens.Not everyone was as quick to embrace change; some growers were concerned about losing shelf life while they waited for results. Mr. Wilson was unmoved by that argument. \u201cIf you can test and verify microbial safety, what do I care if I lose shelf life?\u201d he says.The Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011, intended to improve food safety practices, has been mired in missed deadlines, which have been attributed to food-industry concerns about overregulation and to an unrealistic timeline given the scope of the overhaul. The delays led to a lawsuit by the Center for Food Safety and the Center for Environmental Health, two advocacy groups. The F.D.A. and the Office of Management and Budget now operate under a court-ordered schedule that requires regulations to be issued in late 2015 and 2016.The F.D.A. currently stops short of requiring produce tests, although it conducts its own \u201csurveillance sampling,\u201d according to Juli Putnam, an agency spokeswoman. The agency sees two drawbacks to mandatory tests: \u201cA negative product test result does not necessarily indicate the absence of a hazard,\u201d Ms. Putnam wrote in an email, because contamination might show up in another part of a field, and conducting more tests would increase the costs that are passed on to the consumer.The agency is focused instead on defining minimum safety standards for \u201cpotential sources of microbiological contamination such as agricultural water, worker health and hygiene and animals in the growing area,\u201d she wrote (though some preventive testing is conducted on sprouts).Mr. Wilson says he uses government guidelines \u201cas a minimum standard, and I always try to go above and beyond that.\u201dDNATrek, a newcomer to the field, sees opportunity in another aspect of food safety testing: the need to quickly pinpoint the source of a pathogen outbreak, to avoid delays and unnecessarily broad recalls. Anthony Zografos, the company\u2019s chief executive, says it soon plans to introduce a test called DNATrax, which will be able to identify the source of contaminated produce within an hour, narrowing recall efforts \u201cto a specific field or packer or distributor.\u201d The test relies on tracer DNA that is dissolved in the liquid coating applied to many types of produce after harvest or added to prepared foods; it provides a unique genetic fingerprint.George Farquar, a chemist and Mr. Zografos\u2019s partner in the company, was looking for ways to trace airborne contaminants as part of a national security project financed by the Defense Department when he realized that the work could be applied to food safety. He and Mr. Zografos licensed the technology from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where he was conducting the research, and it will receive royalties from sales of the test. Mr. Zografos says that DNATrax will offer traceability for most types of field produce at a price of about $1 for 1,000 pounds.Tracking Down FraudFood safety is a yes-or-no proposition \u2014 either there is a contaminant or there isn\u2019t. Food fraud, a smaller segment of the universe of problem foods, is harder to detect because it can take so many forms. Fish from a country whose imports have been banned might arrive at the market labeled with a different country of origin, honey might be cut with cheaper extenders, and saffron might not even be saffron.When asked if fake food has ever crossed the threshold at Costco, Mr. Wilson smiles and says, \u201cI\u2019m going to go with \u2018no,\u2019 but you\u2019re not going to believe me entirely. Yes, there have been egregious things, and we\u2019ve taken care of them, and that\u2019s that.\u201dOlive oil is a popular target for fraud because there are several ways to charge more for less. Compliance with United States Department of Agriculture quality standards for extra-virgin olive oil is voluntary. Unless a supplier pays for testing, passes and puts a U.S.D.A.-certified sticker on the bottle, consumers have no way to know whether they got extra-virgin olive oil. Any grade of olive oil can be doctored with cheap filler oils like canola, because they have no flavor. And the country of origin listed on the label isn\u2019t always where the contents are from.About five years ago, Mr. Wilson decided it was time to send an employee to Tuscany to collect leaves from Tuscan olive trees. Costco now has an index of DNA information on \u201call the cultivars of Tuscan olive oil, about 16 different ones,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen they harvest and press, we do our DNA testing.\u201dA group of undergraduates at the University of California, Davis, has developed the OliView, a biosensor that can detect rancid or adulterated olive oil. They expect to have the device ready for sale, at $60 to $80, in 18 months to two years. \u201cAt the supermarket level, we found that a lot of times the oil was just old and rancid,\u201d says Selina Wang, research director at the U.C. Davis Olive Center and one of the students\u2019 advisers, \u201cbut there were also samples labeled extra virgin that were actually a little bit of virgin olive oil mixed with refined olive oil.\u201dAdulterated oil, more common among imports, can stump even food professionals. Ms. Wang says that at the center, they \u201chave seen samples with as much as 70 percent canola oil.\u201dDNATrek has also developed a test for products where fraud is a temptation \u2014 \u201chigh-value stuff, truffles, saffron, premium juices, honey, seafood and olive oil,\u201d Mr. Zografos says.Mr. Samadpour says that in multi-ingredient products, the source of trickery is usually hidden further down the food chain than the name on the package. \u201cIt\u2019s not the top people who get involved in economic adulteration,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s someone lower down who sees a way to save a penny here or there. Maybe it\u2019s 2 or 3 cents, but if you sell a million units, that\u2019s $20,000 to $30,000.\u201dConsumer VigilanceAs with most expanding technologies, there are believers and skeptics. David Gombas, senior vice president for food safety and technology at the 111-year-old United Fresh Produce Association, echoes the position of the Food and Drug Administration: Testing is not a sufficient answer for his members, who include anyone engaged in the fresh produce industry, \u201cfrom guys who come up with seeds to growers, shippers, fresh-cut processors, restaurants and grocery stores, everyone from beginning to end,\u201d from small organic farms to Monsanto.Their common ground, he says, is a commitment to food safety \u2014 but members disagree on how to achieve it, including Mr. Gombas and Mr. Samadpour, who are both microbiologists. \u201cMicrobiological testing provides a false sense of security,\u201d Mr. Gombas says. \u201cThey can find one dead salmonella cell on a watermelon, but what does that tell you about the rest of the watermelon in the field? Nothing.\u201dTesting has its place, he says, but as backup for \u201cgood practices and environmental monitoring,\u201d which includes things as diverse as employee hygiene and site visits. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of testing,\u201d he says, \u201cif something funny\u2019s going on.\u201d Otherwise, he has taken on the role of contrarian. \u201cPeople think testing means something. When I say it doesn\u2019t, they smile, nod and keep testing.\u201dMr. Samadpour says sampling \u201ccan reduce the risk tremendously but can never 100 percent eliminate it,\u201d but he will take a tremendous reduction over a food crisis any day. The government\u2019s \u201cindirect\u201d stance, which mandates safety but does not require testing, allows companies to interpret safe practices on \u201ca spectrum,\u201d he says, \u201cfrom bare minimum to sophisticated programs,\u201d and he worries about safety at the low end of that range.He says consumer vigilance is the best defense against the selling of groceries under bare minimum standards.IEH tested the contents of Mr. Samadpour\u2019s grocery cart:The organic raspberries showed 0.12 parts per million of spinosyn A, an insecticide available in both organic and synthetic formulations. Mr. Samadpour\u2019s test cannot distinguish between organic and synthetic spinosyn A, but the tolerance level is the same for both: 0.7 parts per million.

People who are highly allergic or sensitive to peanuts may be at risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction.\u201dInside the labs, reaction was more world-weary than panicked; this was business as usual.\u201cOther than the label somebody\u2019s written,\u201d Mr. Farquar says, \u201cyou really have no idea where your food\u2019s coming from.\u201dMr. Samadpour, having been at this far longer, is more philosophical. \u201cI eat street food when I travel,\u201d he says. \u201cOne can\u2019t become a microbe-phobe.\u201dAn article last Sunday about private testing of grocery items for food safety misstated the type of E. coli that is a lethal threat in ground beef. It is E. coli O157, not 1057.An article on April 5 about private testing of grocery items for product safety misstated the tolerance limit for the insecticide spinosyn A on organic raspberries. Because spinosyn A is available in both organic and synthetic formulations, the tolerance level is identical on both organic and nonorganic berries at 0.7 parts per million; the limit is not 0.035 parts per million for organic berries. Assuming the organic berries tested by IEH Laboratories were treated with the organic formulation of spinosyn A, the test result of 0.12 parts per million was well within the tolerance; it did not exceed it. The test conducted by IEH cannot distinguish between the organic and synthetic formulations.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Promised a Supermarket Five Years Ago, a Housing Project Is Still Waiting", "Date": "2015-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd in this awkward patch, home to 3,500 people in 10 blocky New York City Housing Authority towers, there are very few options for affordable, fresh food. There is a Chinese restaurant, and there are a few bodegas and one small grocery store with a single aisle of produce.Five years ago, the Bloomberg administration announced a plan to redevelop the dilapidated Admiral\u2019s Row at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and a supermarket was a central aspect of the proposal. But the first developer, PA Associates, was dropped after being charged in an unrelated bribery scandal; the second, Blumenfeld Development Group, claimed it was unable to find a supermarket willing to pay insurance premiums after Hurricane Sandy.The crumbling homes of Admiral\u2019s Row still stand today, even as the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation is considering, for the third time, proposals for a new developer. The winning bid will be announced by the end of June, the organization says. At the earliest, a 74,000-square-foot supermarket at the Admiral\u2019s Row site will open in late 2017 \u2014 more than four years delayed.For Karen Mann, a 46-year-old mother of four, that is nearly 1,500 dinners too late. At the beginning of each month, Ms. Mann stocks her pantry at the Western Beef supermarket on Empire Boulevard, more than three miles from her apartment. She then buys fresh produce twice each week at the Pathmark at the Atlantic Center, a mile and a half away. Because she buys so much, she said, she needs to take a cab. All told, she estimates that she spends close to $200 each month just getting to the supermarket to buy food for herself and her four children.\u201cYou have to go out of the neighborhood to get anything,\u201d Ms. Mann said as she unloaded nearly two dozen food-filled plastic bags from a cab\u2019s trunk. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, but we work with what we\u2019ve got.\u201dIf there\u2019s anyone who would have reason to be optimistic that the supermarket will come, it\u2019s Mary Andrews, the indomitable president of the Farragut Houses Tenants Association. But even she appears worn down.\u201cAt this point, I don\u2019t worry about it either way,\u201d she said on a recent afternoon. \u201cThey say three more years, but I don\u2019t get my hopes up that it will be done before I leave this place.\u201dAs head of the association, Ms. Andrews, who is in her 60s, has advocated for her fellow residents for more than two decades. A recent triumph was the addition of a laundry room to one building; until then, residents regularly hiked to a Laundromat on Myrtle Avenue, a 20-minute walk.Advocacy, however, won\u2019t replenish the pantry. So once a month, Ms. Andrews folds her walker, places it into an Access-a-Ride van and heads to the Costco store in Sunset Park. It\u2019s a 20-minute ride each way, but she said the money she saves by buying in bulk makes the journey worth it.On average, a Farragut household has to live on $21,000 a year, and Ms. Andrews is not the only one of her neighbors to shop in Sunset Park. But a monthly trek to Costco is not practical for picking up perishables.\u201cThe community really needs a place where they can purchase fresh fruits and vegetables,\u201d she said.For those living in the Farragut Houses, the closest option is the Fine Food Supermarket on York Street. At 4,000 square feet, it is about 5 percent the size of the proposed Admiral\u2019s Row supermarket; sandwiched between the lone aisle of produce and the meat locker are various cat foods and religious candles.As convenient as the Fine Food is, many residents consider it a last resort.\u201cSometimes they\u2019ll have a sale,\u201d said Tina Miller, who was pushing a metal cart filled with Fine Food bags back to her apartment. \u201cBut for the most part, it\u2019s overpriced.\u201d (A store manager, who gave his name only as Andy, said, \u201cWe stock for what the neighborhood wants.\u201d)Ms. Miller prefers to shop at Bravo Supermarket in Fort Greene, a 30-minute walk from her apartment. She takes her groceries home with a shuttle service provided by the store, which is adjacent to another housing project.Fresh food used to be much easier to find in the neighborhoods bordering the Navy Yard, which include Vinegar Hill to the west, Fort Greene and Clinton Hill to the south, and Williamsburg to the east. The Wallabout Market at the Navy Yard\u2019s southeast corner was once the world\u2019s second-largest food market; it was repurposed during World War II, when the Navy Yard employed 70,000 workers. At that time, stores and cafeterias abounded, both on the grounds and in the vicinity.When the war ended, so did the livelihoods of many food vendors around the facility, and the Navy Yard began a slow decline. After the federal government decommissioned the base in 1966, it transferred most of the property to New York City. One exception was Admiral\u2019s Row, a cluster of Second Empire officers\u2019 residences at the yard\u2019s southwest corner. The rest of the Navy Yard found a second life as a center of light industrial manufacturing and film production, but Admiral\u2019s Row, still federal property, fell into disrepair. All but two of its 11 buildings are beyond saving.During this time, food culture in Brooklyn blossomed, and the new food options reflect the increased demand for all things organic and artisanal. The paradox is that this bounty is mostly unavailable in lower-income neighborhoods, where inexpensive options have been driven out. Since 2006, two large, affordable supermarkets on Myrtle Avenue have closed, replaced by apartments; smaller and often more expensive specialty food stores have moved in to fill the void, although there are plans for a Key Food to open in one of the buildings.The situation will soon become even more difficult. In February, Slate Property Group announced plans to close the Key Food at Lafayette Avenue and Grand Avenue in Clinton Hill. It, too, will be razed for residential development.Staff members at the Myrtle Avenue Brooklyn Partnership, which works with small businesses and residents to maintain the area\u2019s economic vitality, have been trying to identify solutions to the latest setback. Of concern are not only the low-income residents of the Housing Authority projects \u2014 in addition to the Farragut Houses, there are nearly 9,000 residents of the nearby Whitman and Ingersoll Houses, both on Myrtle Avenue \u2014 but also elderly people, many of whom relied on the Key Food.\u201cIt\u2019s causing a lot of anxiety and stress for our neighbors,\u201d said Kassy Nystrom, director of the nonprofit\u2019s Healthy Communities Initiative.Areas without ready access to affordable, nutritious foods are associated with poorer health \u2014 in particular higher rates of obesity and diabetes \u2014 and the Farragut Houses are no exception. Whether the Admiral\u2019s Row supermarket will change eating habits at the project, however, is an open question. Access is only part of the solution. Indeed, two recent studies suggest that its effects might be negligible.The researchers urged caution in applying these findings to other situations. \u201cThe only thing we can say here is people\u2019s behaviors are very resistant to change,\u201d said Brian Elbel, lead author of the Langone study. \u201cCould you imagine educational or other techniques to jump-start or shorten that? Sure, but there\u2019s not a whole lot of evidence on what that is.\u201dBut for Mary Andrews and her constituents at the Farragut Houses, the issue is much simpler. \u201cWe just need a supermarket,\u201d Ms. Andrews said.Advertisement"}

At least three-quarters of actively managed mutual funds failed to beat the index over three, five and 10 years.

{"Headline": "Tsipras Signals Possible Greek Referendum on Credit Deal", "Date": "2015-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece said on Tuesday that he might resort to calling a public referendum on any deal with the country\u2019s international creditors if the package seems to go beyond the political mandate that brought his leftist government into power.Greece\u2019s international creditors might not welcome the prospect of a referendum on a deal with the Greek government.Putting an agreement to a vote by the Greek public \u201cwill cost money and create great political uncertainty,\u201d the Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said in a television interview on Tuesday. Mr. Dijsselbloem is the head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, which is leading the negotiations with Greece.\u201cI don\u2019t think we have the time,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cNeither do the Greeks have time.\u201dBut Mr. Tsipras expressed confidence that Greece would swiftly secure a deal with the country\u2019s creditors. He said he expected an agreement by May 9, just three days before Greece must make a debt repayment of around 760 million euros, or about $826 million, to the International Monetary Fund.Greece\u2019s finances have run perilously low, feeding speculation that the country will default on its debt or be forced to leave the eurozone.Mr. Tsipras, whose government was elected in January, made his remarks in a live television interview that started late on Monday and finished in the early hours of Tuesday. The 40-year-old prime minister emphasized that his government\u2019s priority was to pay salaries and pensions.Pushed to reveal his course of action in the event of a deadlock in talks with creditors, Mr. Tsipras said he would turn to Greek citizens.\u201cIf I find myself in the difficult position of an agreement which falls outside our mandate, then the Greek people will have to give the answer,\u201d he said, adding, however, that \u201cI am certain we will not reach that point.\u201dHe ruled out calling for an early general election. \u201cObviously I\u2019m not going to go to elections,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat for?\u201dUnderlining that his government\u2019s mission was to \u201cstop the vicious circle of austerity, misery and looting,\u201d Mr. Tsipras repeated his opposition to more pension cuts and mass dismissals in the labor market.He said, however, that an unpopular property tax, which his Syriza party had promised to abolish, might have to stay in place until 2016 because of budgetary constraints. He also appeared more flexible on the sale and lease of state assets, suggesting that port and airport deals could proceed.In a bid to scrape together the cash to cover domestic commitments and debt obligations, the government passed a decree last week obliging state entities to hand over their spare cash. The move has raised some money, but it remains unclear whether it is enough to cover looming repayments as the country\u2019s mayors and university academics, among others, push back against the measure.Officials of the new negotiating team, being coordinated by Mr. Tsakalotos, started work late Monday on drafting legislation that, it is hoped, will win over creditors. The bill is to include \u201cfiscal issues, tax administration, the auction of frequencies for TV channels, taxation of TV commercials and administrative reform,\u201d according to the Finance Ministry.The question is whether the legislation can be completed, and pushed through Greece\u2019s Parliament, quickly enough to ensure the timely release of a \u20ac7.2 billion bailout installment.The changes made by Mr. Tsipras to the negotiating team buoyed markets, and stocks and bonds rose again on Tuesday, suggesting a degree of optimism about a potential deal. But the continuing uncertainty has rattled Greeks, who have withdrawn billions of euros in deposits from banks in recent weeks. That has undermined banks that depend on emergency funding from the European Central Bank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uncertainty Over Impact of a Default by Greece", "Date": "2015-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen it comes to assessing the consequences of a messy Greek default on global markets, two views have vied for supremacy in the minds of investors.Now, with Greece nearly out of cash and talks with the country\u2019s creditors at an impasse, regulators, investors and economists are coming around to a view that after five years of endless analysis and speculation, no one really knows how the markets will react.And that may be the scariest thought of all.\u201cThere is just no playbook for this,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at the Deltec International Group, a Bahamas-based investment company. \u201cThat is what concerns me.\u201dNothing vexes a professional investor more than uncertainty, that creeping belief that after all the number-crunching and analyzing, one is still unable to predict anything resembling a likely outcome.And that is where many investors find themselves at this moment as they struggle to interpret the mix of bureaucratic machinations and inscrutable politics that have come to define Europe\u2019s relationship with Greece.On Monday, the Greek stock market rallied and bond yields dipped in the face of speculation that Greece\u2019s controversial finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, would assume a reduced role in future talks with Greece\u2019s creditors.During talks last week in Riga, Latvia, eurozone officials complained that Mr. Varoufakis was obstructing progress on a debt deal by not providing details on the economic reforms that Europe is demanding from Greece before releasing another round of loans.They have bonded over endless phone calls before Mr. Tsipras\u2019s party won the election earlier this year. While Mr. Varoufakis was on a teaching break at the University of Texas in 2013, Mr. Tsipras came to Austin for a visit, and the two men and their wives drank beer and danced to country music in the city\u2019s honky-tonk bars.Over the weekend, Mr. Tsipras reaffirmed his support for his embattled finance minister in a phone call and email exchange with Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who represents European creditors and who has clashed on several occasions with Mr. Varoufakis.In a brief interview on Monday, Mr. Varoufakis said that while a new team was being formed in relation to creditor talks, he will oversee it and continue to represent Greece in these negotiations.\u201cI am not going anywhere,\u201d Mr. Varoufakis said.In addition to pushing for Mr. Varoufakis\u2019s ouster, Mr. Dijsselbloem asked that creditor missions be allowed to resume their work in Greek government ministries.To both these requests, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s response was no, Mr. Varoufakis said.Unlike the market talk during the earlier crisis in 2011 and 2012, the debate among investors now is not focused on which banks and funds will suffer from their Greek investments, as these exposures have been sharply pared back.Instead, the current market worry is both more diffuse and less clear.Yet for many bankers and regulators \u2014 many of whom still bear the scars of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 \u2014 it is precisely this mix of complacency and uncertainty that worries them.\u201cThe bottom line is that no one really knows what will happen if Greece does not pay,\u201d said Hans Humes, who runs Greylock Capital, a hedge fund that specializes in distressed bonds.It is not for a want of trying.Over the last year, investors have taken some unusual steps to gain just the slightest information edge when it comes to grasping these complexities.One investor commissioned a psychiatrist to assess the mental health of Mr. Varoufakis via video clips, to try to better understand the opinionated academic\u2019s brazen negotiating tactics.And one banker, seeking some historical perspective, has been scouring Byzantine history books for fresh insights.There have been few answers so far, however.\u201cWe just don\u2019t know,\u201d said one frustrated hedge fund investor after a weekend spent scrutinizing the websites of Greek newspapers for a clue.One thing is for certain, though: As long as the debt talks stumble on without agreement, the greater the likelihood is that Greece either misses a debt payment (it owes 763 million euros, or about $830 million, to the International Monetary Fund on May 12) or submits to capital controls to stem a fatal bank run.Greek finance officials have been looking into the possibility of Greece issuing i.o.u.s, or scrip payments, as a way to save scarce euros.Mr. Varoufakis has long argued that a Greek default and exit from the euro would be seismic and carry a broad cost to Europe of over \u20ac1 trillion.Eric Dor, an expert on eurozone capital flows at the I\u00e9seg School of Management in France, says in a paper that while private sector investors hold fewer Greek bonds these days, the exposure of the European taxpayer to Greek debt has skyrocketed to \u20ac318 billion.By refusing to pay Greece the \u20ac7.2 billion from the last bailout because of disagreements over economic reforms, Europe is now courting a default on this much larger sum.Senior members of the United States government, in perhaps their only area of agreement with Mr. Varoufakis, also worry that Europe may be underplaying the consequences of a Greek default.\u201cWe view this as serious,\u201d said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cThis is a world of unknown unknowns.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In the U.S., a complete shift to digital radio would take an act of Congress, just as the digital television switch in 2009 did.DAB, which originated in Europe, offers more channel capacity, lower transmission costs and less signal noise than FM technology. At certain compression levels, the sound quality is equal or superior to FM.But FM is far more established around the world than DAB, and DAB is not compatible with existing FM radio sets.Norway is a relatively easy place to switch over.It has only five nationally broadcast FM channels to begin with.

{"Headline": "Three Ways to Beat a Benchmark", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bull market rumbled past its sixth birthday in March. Despite that marathon climb, fund managers are still finding underappreciated stocks. The stewards of three of the top-performing funds of the first quarter grabbed gains in the health care sector and Japan.Why make that big bet? Mr. Vandeventer said he believed that genetic science was continuing to increase the ability of companies to create drugs that can zero in on particular cancers. He called that development \u201cone of the great revolutions we\u2019ll see in our lifetimes.\u201dFollowing so many stocks can be challenging. He has developed a quantitative screen he runs regularly against the thousands of mid- and small-capitalization stocks that he might buy. If the screen highly ranks a company that the fund does not own, Mr. Vandeventer starts digging to see what he might have missed.The fund, which has an expense ratio of 1.3 percent, returned 11.3 percent in the first quarter, compared with 0.95 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. It returned an annualized average of 18 percent over the five years ending March 31.Based on its price/earnings ratio, United Therapeutics looks cheap considering the growth rate of its earnings, said Lawrence G. Kemp, one of the fund\u2019s co-managers. United Therapeutics, known for its treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension, was recently trading at a P/E of 28.2, compared with an industry average of 47.4, according to Morningstar.Mr. Kemp and his co-managers have made an even bigger bet on consumer discretionary companies, which represented nearly 40 percent of assets at the end of February. Among their favorites is Netflix. The company leads its industry in technology and content spending, creating a high barrier for competitors, said a fund co-manager, Philip H. Ruvinsky. Netflix has built a dominant market position in the United States, and Mr. Ruvinsky said he expected the same abroad.Another entertainment holding is the Madison Square Garden Company, which owns sports teams, including the New York Knicks and Liberty basketball teams; cable channels; and other venues besides its arena. Mr. Ruvinsky said the market mistakenly valued the company based on current earnings, failing to account fully for the value of its \u201ctrophy assets.\u201d The Knicks, for example, are most likely worth billions, given that the Los Angeles Clippers sold last year for $2 billion, he said.The BlackRock managers separate their holdings into three baskets: superior, durable and periodic growers. Netflix goes in the superior basket, and Madison Square Garden into the durable one, Mr. Ruvinsky said.The fund returned 11.4 percent in the first quarter, and its A shares carry a net expense ratio of 1.39 percent. It returned an annualized average of 14.9 percent over the last five years.\u201cFor the past couple of decades, Japanese companies haven\u2019t been run in an aggressive manner,\u201d Mr. Ciganer said. \u201cEither they weren\u2019t run for shareholders or deflation was pressuring them so much that they couldn\u2019t be aggressive.\u201dMr. Ciganer said two developments changed the way Japanese companies operate: growth in the share of Japanese stocks owned by foreigners and a government, led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, committed to vanquishing deflation and reinvigorating the economy. \u201cThis could be a once-in-a-generation turning point,\u201d he said.Foreign investors like T. Rowe Price demand more transparency and responsiveness than Japanese companies typically provided, Mr. Ciganer said. When outsiders represented a smaller share of the market, those demands could be ignored. Now Japanese companies are hewing more to United States and European norms of governance, he said.Consider Japan Tobacco, one of the fund\u2019s top 10 holdings. \u201cIt was one of the first companies to be in this new wave of Western-style corporate governance,\u201d he said. \u201cThey stepped up the dividend payout, and they started buying back stock.\u201dEven holdouts have begun to change, like Fanuc, a maker of industrial robots. \u201cBefore, they wouldn\u2019t even meet investors \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t have results meetings or calls,\u201d Mr. Ciganer said. Lately, the company has said it will establish an investor relations department and start returning more cash to shareholders, he said.Mr. Ciganer took over the fund at the end of 2013. He had worked as analyst on it for the previous seven years, and he does not predict major changes in its investment style under his management. \u201cWe have a responsibility to our clients to not do anything revolutionary,\u201d he said.He has been selling off holdings to shrink the number of stocks; the fund held 75 at the end of last year. He said he believed that a more concentrated portfolio contributes to active management, adding that when managers do not concentrate, their funds can end up looking too much like their benchmark indexes. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a closet indexer,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople might as well buy an E.T.F.\u201dThe fund, with an expense ratio of 1.05 percent, returned 13 percent in the first quarter.

{"Headline": "Virtu, a High-Frequency Trader, Resumes Its I.P.O.", "Date": "2015-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter shelving plans to go public last year amid uproar over Michael Lewis\u2019s book about high-frequency trading, one of the biggest firms in that field is restarting its initial public offering.Virtu Financial disclosed on Monday that it hopes to raise as much as $313.5 million in its initial stock sale by selling shares at $17 to $19 each. At the midpoint of that range, the company would be valued at about $2.5 billion.In restarting its I.P.O. process, Virtu is betting that the furor over high-frequency trading \u2014 in which computer programs buy and sell shares in milliseconds \u2014 has died down. The firm had been deep in the process of going public when Mr. Lewis\u2019s \u201cFlash Boys,\u201d a literary broadside against an industry that it depicted as having rigged the stock markets, emerged with much fanfare.By the time \u201cFlash Boys\u201d was published last year, several government regulators had begun looking into high-frequency trading firms like Virtu, including New York\u2019s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman. At the heart of those inquiries is whether those companies have an unfair advantage over other traders.Defenders of the industry argue that they improve the liquidity of public stock markets through their rapid-fire trading, making it easier for both big and small investors to buy and sell stocks.Over all, Virtu earned $190 million last year, up 4 percent compared with results in the previous year and more than double what it earned in 2012. Its total revenue last year was $723 million, up 8 percent from the year before.By comparison, KCG Holdings, the publicly held trading firm once known as Knight Capital, reported $61 million in profit and $1.2 billion in revenue last year.Among other disclosures in Virtu\u2019s prospectus, the company said that it would have four classes of common stock, with two of them \u2014 Class B and Class D \u2014 having 10 votes per share compared with one for the other two classes. That means that even after the stock sale, Mr. Viola\u2019s family will maintain control of the firm, with more than 93 percent of the overall voting power available. At the midpoint of the offering, the Violas\u2019 stake would be worth about $1.4 billion.Virtu plans to begin trading later this month on the Nasdaq stock market under the ticker symbol VIRT.Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners are leading the underwriting of the offering.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why a Harvard Professor Has Mixed Feelings When Students Take Jobs in Finance", "Date": "2015-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThis is a bittersweet time on campus. Seniors are beginning to find jobs, and while their enthusiasm is infectious, some of their choices give me pause.Of course, these are intensely personal choices as young people chase their aspirations and dreams. But if a favorite student of mine comes up to me and says, \u201cI just got an offer at this investment bank and I\u2019m going to take it,\u201d I want to know how should I feel about it. I will be happy for her individually, but still I wonder: Is this a good decision for society as a whole?As an economist, I look at it this way: Every profession produces both private returns \u2014 the fruits of labor that a person enjoys \u2014 and social returns \u2014 those that society enjoys. If I set up a shop on Etsy selling photographs, my private returns may be defined as the revenue I generate. The social returns are the pleasure that my photographs provide to my customers.People in some professions provide a surplus of social returns. Inventors are a good example. Take the modern semiconductor. It made possible countless other inventions \u2014 nearly every piece of computing we interact with today.It is important to remember that it is not just inventors, teachers or nonprofit workers who provide more social than private value. This is an economic insight as old as Adam Smith: Thanks to the division of labor, in a well-functioning market we can do our own thing and still contribute to the greater good. Inventors may be supervalue-adders, but most of us add value, albeit to a lesser degree. This is a comforting power of markets: We can do good for society simply by doing what we do well.Job titles don\u2019t tell you whether someone is primarily a rent seeker. A lawyer who helps draft precise contracts may actually be helping the wheels of commerce turn, and so creating wealth. But trial lawyers in a country with poorly functioning tort systems may simply be extracting rents: They can make money by pursuing frivolous lawsuits.In this respect, finance is a vexing industry. Take arbitrage \u2014 a common way to make money in finance. Find a stock that should be valued at $15 but that is trading at $10, buy it, wait and hope. You might assume that stock markets are just a big casino, in which skilled traders extract money.But arbitrageurs can create value, and stock markets can play an important social function. They determine which companies receive capital cheaply and which pay a heavy price for it, determining where factories are built, which retail stores are expanded and where research and development happens. Mispriced stocks can mean misplaced investments. Arbitrageurs help get the prices right, and that\u2019s important.Still, arbitrage is valuable only to a point. It has a gold rush element with prospectors racing to get to the gold first. While finding gold has value, finding gold before someone else does is mainly rent-seeking.But finance need not be this way. George Bailey, the protagonist in the classic film \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d was a banker. When he was reluctant to take the job, his father explained to him: \u201cYou know, George, I feel that in a small way we are doing something important. Satisfying a fundamental urge. It\u2019s deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace, and we\u2019re helping him get those things.\u201dGeorge Bailey\u2019s father realized that finance has the ability to do great good. And he was right. The poor face a tremendous problem every day juggling money and expenses. Their pay often fluctuates week by week, yet they must pay rent no matter what they earn. Right now, poor people often use expensive payday loans or must incur expensive late fees.Surely we could do better. Finding ways to smooth out these shocks is the kind of important, socially valuable problem that finance could solve. Many other crucial social problems have finance at their root, from saving for college to insuring unemployment risk.Instead of finding clever ways to hide fees, banking innovations could solve these real and important problems. In much of the developing world, we have already come to associate finance with creative ways to lend to the poor or to offer microinsurance products that protect farmers against uncertain rainfall. There is no reason we cannot have a similar wave of positive financial innovation in the United States.So how should I feel about my students going into finance? I hope they realize that they have the potential to do great good and not simply make money. It may not be how the industry is structured now, but idealism and inventiveness are two of the best traits of youth, and finance especially could use them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese State-Owned Company, in a First, Defaults on Its Domestic Bonds", "Date": "2015-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 For decades, regardless of weaknesses or inefficiencies, an overriding certainty of state-backed capitalism in China has been that the government looks after its own.That may be changing.On Tuesday, a little-known power equipment manufacturer became the first state-owned company to default in China\u2019s huge domestic bond market, throwing doubt on the long-held notion that such businesses have implicit government backing.The development could signal a watershed moment for China\u2019s state-owned businesses, which tend to enjoy easy access to cheap sources of debt funding \u2014 often with little apparent regard for the health of their finances. It is also likely to give new weight to repeated pledges by the Communist Party leadership in Beijing to push through a number of financial reforms to give market forces a greater role.\u201cI think it\u2019s probably just the beginning,\u201d said Ying Wang, a senior director of corporate ratings at Fitch Ratings in Shanghai.\u201cIt makes sense for more commercially unviable, inefficiently run state-owned enterprises to default, because otherwise capital can never be allocated efficiently among state and private enterprises,\u201d Ms. Wang said. \u201cAnd that runs against the government\u2019s reform agenda.\u201dThe bond market is a critical component of that reform effort. China\u2019s onshore bond market has doubled in size to more than $4 trillion over the last five years, and it is now the world\u2019s third largest after those of the United States and Japan. It remains largely closed to foreign investors, but it is a primary source of local fund-raising, especially for state companies. Last month, Beijing unveiled plans for the bond market to provide more than $160 billion in refinancing to China\u2019s heavily indebted local governments.It is hard to know how the latest default will play out. China recently revamped its bankruptcy laws, but companies, their investors and the court system have little practical experience in this area.\u201cThe government\u2019s invisible hand has always been in play,\u201d Ms. Wang of Fitch said of China\u2019s short history of dealing with bond defaults. \u201cWe need to see a more consistent and orderly restructuring process from the legal perspective, so that when people invest in domestic bonds, they know how they can get their money back.\u201dHow the situation at Tianwei is resolved will be an important indicator of China\u2019s commitment to market discipline.In the case of the Chaori default, outside guarantee companies were brought in, and bondholders were ultimately repaid all the principal and interest owed. Banks that made loans to Chaori without collateral, as well as the company\u2019s large trade creditors, were hit with losses. But the Communist Party-controlled court ensured that ordinary investors and smaller creditors were not affected. Mass layoffs were avoided after a new owner was found for the company\u2019s main businesses.\u201cUltimately the question is one of market discipline,\u201d said Charles Chang, the head of Asian credit strategy at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. \u201cIn a free capitalist market, this is gained by default experience, but in China, this has yet to come in a meaningful way to the bond market.\u201dTianwei, a maker of transformers and other equipment for China\u2019s nuclear, solar and wind power industries, is based in the city of Baoding in Hebei Province. It is controlled by the China South Industries Group, which is one of the biggest defense contractors owned by the central government and one of more than 100 companies under the direct control of the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet.Tianwei had losses of about $1.6 billion last year, which it blamed on the poor performance of the renewable energy sector. In its statement on Tuesday, the company said it would continue to try to find ways to make the missed payments, including through the possible sale of assets.\u201cWith the company\u2019s huge losses in 2014 and a sharp rise in the ratio of our debts to assets, we lost financing capacity, and new funding has dried up,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cDespite great efforts on many fronts, we still haven\u2019t been able to raise funds to meet our interest payments.\u201dA woman who answered the phone at Tianwei\u2019s offices in Baoding on Tuesday said the company\u2019s board secretary and its investor relations representative were traveling and could not be reached. No other executives were available for comment.Advertisement"}

Unlike other fund companies, BlackRock does not have any leveraged loan E.T.F.s.Of the $70 billion in net inflows that BlackRock took in this quarter, $35 billion came from its iShares E.T.F. unit \u2014 with $18 billion of that flowing into fast-growing funds like high yield debt and corporate bonds. BlackRock now has close to $1.1 trillion in E.T.F.s under management, by far the most in the industry.And that is the rub, in the view of a growing number of academics and watchdogs.In a brief interview on Wednesday, Mr. Rubin said that these funds \u2014 which have exploded in size since the financial crisis \u2014 had not yet faced a broad and sustained market sell-off so it remained unclear how well they would respond to a wave of investors demanding their money back.BlackRock has argued that bond E.T.F.s, and its increasing size, are healthful for the markets in general and that in a low interest rate environment it is to be expected that long-term investors like insurance companies and pension funds invest in higher yielding securities to lock in better returns.Moreover, the industry has said that firms like BlackRock do not invest their own capital in these types of securities \u2014 as investment banks did before the crisis \u2014 and do not rely on leverage to bolster returns.\u201cWe live in a low rate environment in which insurance companies and pension funds have to invest their money,\u201d said Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, who noted that three-quarters of the firm\u2019s clients were these types of buy-and-hold investors. \u201cWe are their agents, and we are investing money for them.\u201d\u201cLong-term investors are chasing disappearing yields,\u201d he said at the financial stability conference, highlighting the negligible and in some cases negative yields on long-term German and Swiss bonds. \u201cYou are now paying to bear risk so the question is: Is this a sign of exuberance or distress?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Fishing, Suspense Trumps a Sure Thing", "Date": "2015-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPersonal JourneysIf you\u2019d asked me a year ago whether the day that I caught 25 fish would be better than the day I caught just one, I\u2019d have said it would be no contest. But I\u2019d have been wrong.First, the 25-fish day.It happened during a visit to France to a village near Lyon with a friend who thought I would be bereft to be several thousand miles from Montana\u2019s streams, where I usually spend weeks in summer. Drives in the rolling countryside, eating well at far-from-fancy restaurants and, above all, stocking up at glorious farmers\u2019 markets like the one at Venaison easily outmatched the Rocky Mountain counterparts. Still, a summer without fishing can never be considered perfect. So we organized a couple of day trips, with Fran\u00e7ois Mansbendel, a guide we found when we searched for fishing guides in Lyon online.Fran\u00e7ois picked us up at the home where we were staying, bringing a spinning rod and a variety of lures. We could not fit in his small car so we followed him in our own for about 20 miles of small factories and villages to an inlet of the Rhone River.Our first quarry would be pike. Why pike? Because we were near Lyon, a center of French cooking whose signature dish is quenelle de brochet, or pike. Even though the Rhone is so polluted that you wouldn\u2019t eat anything caught there, we did it for the sake of tradition. Thanks to the pollution, the pike for Lyon\u2019s quenelles are now flown from Denmark, but Fran\u00e7ois promised angling success, even if our catch was inedible. Yet I had no strikes in several hours. It made me appreciate store-bought quenelles all the more.The world over, guides assure unsuccessful anglers that the next day will be better. Fran\u00e7ois was no different \u2014 except that he was right.The next morning we drove through dramatic hilly countryside to a park near the village of St.-Germain-sur-l\u2019Arbresle to meet Fran\u00e7ois, who has a day job there teaching schoolchildren how to fish. He set out a folding chair by the side of a pond that he said was stocked with carp. It was midweek and no one else was fishing, but the pond was large enough to offer casting stations for two dozen anglers.Then he set up a long, very light spinning rod and tutored me in casting with tackle that was very different from the fly rods I know. It was easy and, if anything, I cast too far. No need, he assured me, to go beyond the middle of the pond.The first surprise was what went on the hook after I had made a few practice casts. We were not using a metal lure, a streamer, or a worm or even corn or dough balls \u2014 two favorite American baits for carp. Instead, Fran\u00e7ois took out the cuisine Lyonnaise these carp were accustomed to \u2014 a pellet of fish food. He fastened it onto the long shank of a hook with what looked like a rubber band.The second surprise was even more unfamiliar. I cast into the middle of the pond. Fran\u00e7ois picked up a slingshot, filled it with eight or 10 more pellets, and fired them into the area where my cast had gone. He was chumming to attract carp to the place where my hook lay on the bottom. He laid the rod down on a small tripod. We would sit back. When the rod started to vibrate, he told me to set the hook.It worked, 25 times. Eighteen carp and seven tench (also called doctor fish) were netted and released. None heavier than three pounds, but they did fight. None shook off the hook. They never broke the surface or jumped.Since I started fishing about 65 years ago, I can\u2019t remember catching that many fish in a day. But after a while it became routine, and we packed up in midafternoon \u2014 which was just as well, because we got thoroughly lost on the way back.Six weeks later, I was fishing for Atlantic salmon on the Miramichi in New Brunswick, Canada. I try to end each season there in rugged, forested country at a luxurious lodge, the Ledges Inn in Doaktown. The weather was splendid, unfortunately. Salmon always seem harder to catch on bright, sunny days.None of us fishing out of the Ledges Inn had success. Like me, an English couple had been skunked for three days. We all saw plenty of fish. They jumped, far away and nearby, seemingly taunting anglers with their leaps. After all, salmon don\u2019t have a middle finger.With little more than an hour before I would have to leave to catch a plane home, I gave up on a long pool called Maples, where there were plenty of aerobatic fish, including a big one that had come up to look at my fly, then spurned it. I asked my guide, Vemrose Taylor, to take us upstream to a pool called Kelly\u2019s Run.Salmon fishing, even on a very slow day, isn\u2019t boring. The so-called fish of a thousand casts keeps you on edge, waiting to feel the light tap on the line that is often all the chance you get to hook it. Some days all you get is casting practice, lots of it.The sky had clouded over, and Vemrose suggested we switch flies, changing from a Green Machine to an Ally\u2019s Shrimp, a pattern with a lot of orange. Kelly\u2019s has a fast current, and the fly swung sharply away from the bank and downstream.Finally I hooked a fish. It jumped six times, trying to shake the hook loose. We could see that it wasn\u2019t big, a grilse (a young salmon returning to its native river after only one winter at sea) between four and five pounds. But it made a couple of desperate runs when Vemrose tried to net him. He did land him, but I can\u2019t prove it because he must be the only guide in North America who doesn\u2019t carry a camera or a camera phone. I would have brought it home, but Ledges has a strict catch-and-release policy to preserve salmon stocks.The suspense of the one-fish day topped the predictability of the 25-fish day, even though trying new techniques and new water are always rewards of their own. So this year I\u2019m trying for trout in the South Holston River in Tennessee and the White (as in Whitewater) in Arkansas, and some familiar Montana streams.And salmon in the Miramichi, of course.

{"Headline": "Wall Street Fees Wipe Out $2.5 Billion in New York City Pension Gains", "Date": "2015-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Lenape tribe got a better deal on the sale of Manhattan island than New York City\u2019s pension funds have been getting from Wall Street, according to a new analysis by the city comptroller\u2019s office.The analysis concluded that, over the past 10 years, the five pension funds have paid more than $2 billion in fees to money managers and have received virtually nothing in return, Comptroller Scott M. Stringer said in an interview on Wednesday.\u201cWe asked a simple question: Are we getting value for the fees we\u2019re paying to Wall Street?\u201d Mr. Stringer said. \u201cThe answer, based on this 10-year analysis, is no.\u201dUntil now, Mr. Stringer said, the pension funds have reported the performance of many of their investments before taking the fees paid to money managers into account. After factoring in those fees, his staff found that they had dragged the overall returns $2.5 billion below expectations over the last 10 years.\u201cWhen you do the math on what we pay Wall Street to actively manage our funds, it\u2019s shocking to realize that fees have not only wiped out any benefit to the funds, but have in fact cost taxpayers billions of dollars in lost returns,\u201d Mr. Stringer said.Why the trustees of the funds \u2014 Mr. Stringer included \u2014 would not have performed those calculations in the past is not clear.Mr. Stringer, who was a trustee of one of the funds when he was Manhattan borough president before being elected comptroller, said the returns on investments in publicly traded assets, mostly stocks and bonds, have traditionally been reported without taking fees into account. The fees have been disclosed only in footnotes to the funds\u2019 quarterly statements, he said.The stakes in this arena are huge. The city\u2019s pension system is the fourth largest in the country, with total assets of nearly $160 billion. It holds retirement funds for about 715,000 city employees, including teachers, police officers and firefighters.Most of the funds\u2019 money \u2014 more than 80 percent \u2014 is invested in plain vanilla assets like domestic and foreign stocks and bonds. The managers of those \u201cpublic asset classes\u201d are usually paid based on the amount of money they manage, not the returns they achieve.Over the last 10 years, the return on those \u201cpublic asset classes\u201d has surpassed expectations by more than $2 billion, according to the comptroller\u2019s analysis. But nearly all of that extra gain \u2014 about 97 percent \u2014 has been eaten up by management fees, leaving just $40 million for the retirees, it found.Figuring out just how big a drag the fees were on the expected returns of the funds overall was not easy, Mr. Stringer said.Scott Evans, the comptroller\u2019s chief investment officer, had to work backward from the footnotes in the reports to estimate just how much had been paid each year to a long list of Wall Street firms that managed investments in the public markets. He then calculated that those fees, combined with the significant underperformance of the investments in private assets like real estate, amount to a whopping negative \u2014 a drag of more than $2.5 billion \u2014 since the end of 2004.Leaders of unions whose members have stakes in the funds said they expected the analysis to lead to changes.\u201cThe fees are exorbitant and we\u2019re not getting a good return on our money,\u201d said Henry Garrido, executive director of District Council 37 and a trustee of the New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement System. \u201cThat\u2019s an insane process to keep doing the same thing over and over.\u201dMr. Garrido said he saw Mr. Stringer\u2019s emphasis on the high fees as a continuation of the efforts of his predecessor, John C. Liu, to improve controls over the managers of the pension funds.Michael Mulgrew, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, said he was happy that his union\u2019s pension fund, the Teachers\u2019 Retirement System of the City of New York, had been performing well. But he said the fees paid to some managers were \u201cridiculous\u201d and should be renegotiated if those managers are retained.\u201cEducation\u2019s always being put under reform; maybe some of these financial practices should be put under reform as well,\u201d Mr. Mulgrew said. He praised Mr. Stringer for taking aim at a line of business that has been very lucrative for Wall Street.\u201cYou are talking about messing with a practice that they don\u2019t want messed with,\u201d Mr. Mulgrew said. \u201cI give the comptroller credit. He\u2019s jumping feet first into this one.\u201dAn article in some editions on Thursday about Wall Street fees that have wiped out $2.5 billion in New York City pension fund gains misidentified the types of investments in the city\u2019s pension funds for which management fees are not traditionally reported. They are investments in publicly traded assets, like stocks and bonds \u2014 not privately traded assets, like real estate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "36 Hours in Lisbon", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by36 HoursEverything old is new again in the Portuguese capital. Throughout the hilly metropolis on the Tagus River, fading structures and spaces are being stylishly reborn. Once-forlorn neighborhood markets have undergone ambitious renovations and currently form the city\u2019s newest hot spots for dining and drinking. Formerly decrepit townhouses now harbor Lisbon\u2019s chicest indie shopping centers, and the once-dodgy docklands boom with emergent night life in multiple guises. Even the city\u2019s dowdy, underused central square and adjacent waterfront have been spruced up for lounging and strolling. At the same time, the city\u2019s classic historical charms, from art museums to industrialists\u2019 mansions, remain beautifully intact, complementing their rejuvenated neighbors.1. Sights and Suds | 4 p.m.For years, the monumental 18th-century square called Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio was surrounded by dull government offices and blighted by construction sites for sewage and transportation projects. In the last few years, however, the square\u2019s icons \u2014 an ornate triumphal arch and a statue of King Dom Jos\u00e9 I \u2014 have been refurbished, and a host of new cafes, bars and boutiques has moved in. The outdoor terrace of the Museu da Cerveja, a beer museum (forgettable) and bar (worthwhile), has lovely views along with beers from Portugal, Brazil, Mozambique and other Lusophone lands. The dry and yeasty Templarium (5 euros, or about $5.32 at $1.06 to the euro) offers a window into another compelling development: an evolving trend of Portuguese microbrews.2. Riverside Renaissance | 5 p.m.Seedy, stinky and garbage-strewn, the neighboring waterfront strip languished for years. Thanks to a recent municipal cleanup, the seaside is now frequented by joggers, strollers, cyclists and picnickers who take advantage of the new tree-lined path, gently graded stone steps and kiosklike cafes along the riverbank. Art-world denizens might recognize the colorful ship called Trafaria Praia. Covered in traditional blue and white tiles and filled with twinkling installations evoking the sea, the ferry was conceived by the artist Joana Vasconcelos and formed the Portuguese pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2013. At 11 a.m., 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. from March through October, the boat offers a one-hour scenic ride.3. Food Court | 8 p.m.Is there one place in Lisbon where you can dine on raw veal, tinned octopus meat, shaved ham, stewed clams, mango ice cream and cherry-flavored ginja liqueur? Why, Mercado da Ribeira, com certeza. Half of the 19th-century structure \u2014 still home to myriad produce stalls \u2014 was taken over in 2014 by Time Out magazine and elevated into a hangarlike, neo-industrial food court where top Lisbon chefs, favorite restaurants, upscale food shops and multiple bars ply their goods. O Prego da Peixaria serves succulent warm beef sandwiches on soft Madeira flatbread like the Betinho (8 euros) \u2014 slathered in melted cheese, barbecue sauce and cured ham \u2014 while Tartar-ia transforms uncooked meats and fish into sculptural and sublimely seasoned creations. The tuna tartar (12.50 euros) comes with ginger, creamy avocado, radish and black sesame seeds.4. Louche Lounge | 10 p.m.A tidal wave of new bars continues to wash through the waterfront streets of the Cais do Sodr\u00e9 district. The naughtiest nights unfold at Pens\u00e3o Amor, which suggests the tufted salon of a debauched baron. Nude portraits, Orientalist paintings, mounted stag heads, leopard-print banquettes, Kama Sutra manuals and even a tarot reader pack the rooms, while the extensive menu of classic cocktails animates the evening with concoctions like the Corpse Reviver #2 (gin, Cointreau, Ricard, Lillet Blanc and lemon juice; 12.50 euros).Explore street view, find things to do in Lisbon, and sign in to your Google account to save your map.5. Arts and Craftsmanship | 11 a.m.Some of the best things in life are not free. Qing dynasty Chinese porcelain vases. Paintings by Pieter Bruegel the Younger. Marble water basins from Versailles. Luckily for Lisbon visitors, the late businessman Ant\u00f3nio de Medeiros e Almeida had deep pockets and a thirst for exquisitely wrought items, resulting in a late 19th-century mansion overflowing with decorative arts. As you stride over the marble floors of Casa-Museu Medeiros e Almeida, you can appraise yourself in gilded mirrors by Thomas Chippendale, walk past 19th-century carpets woven in the Silk Road city of Samarkand, worship at a carved altar from a church in Goa and admire an intricately decorated sky-blue porcelain bidet.6. Surf and Turf | 2 p.m. Pig is big at Charcutaria Lisboa, where aged, air-cured hocks of acorn-fed porco preto (15 euros per 100 grams) are finely sliced into fatty red ribbons. It\u2019s just one of the many boutiques and food stands \u2014 from sushi stalls to juice bars \u2014 in the recently revamped Mercado de Campo de Ourique, a soaring 1930s market. Shrimp is big at Mercado do Marisco, whether boiled with sea salt (9 euros) or pan-fried in garlic and butter sauce, while Atalho do Mercado adds turf to the surf in the form of lamb chops (10.50 euros), smoky-succulent picanha beef sandwiches (5.70 euros) and other meaty treats.7. A 21st-Century Souk | 4 p.m. Resplendent with horseshoe arches, geometric mosaic floors, Arabesque swirls of chiseled plaster and other Moorish flourishes, the disused 19th-century mansion across from Pra\u00e7a do Principe Real was reborn in 2013 as a neo-sultanic \u201cConceptual Shopping Gallery\u201d called Embaixada. The stately rooms are occupied by local Portuguese boutiques and brands such as Urze, which sells elegant Portuguese wool goods, and Temporary Brand, a concept store stocking everything from canned sardines to silver hightops by iShoes.8. Drop In on the Neighbors | 5:30 p.m.Almost next door, Entre Tanto is another historical townhouse that has been similarly upgraded into a stylish haven for local indie shops and designers. Within the rambling warren of rooms you\u2019ll find Fresh, a brand of handbags that mix clear acrylic surfaces with traditional textiles, as well as Nichts Neues, an emporium of retro cinema seats, industrial lamps, midcentury modern Scandinavian furniture and other vintage treasures. To help you clean up after your ramblings, Patine stocks soaps, lotions, shower gels and more from Portus Cale, a venerable manufacturer based in Porto.9. Comfort Food, Lisbon-Style | 8 p.m.Situated near St. Christopher (S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o) church, the new Leopold restaurant exudes humility and grace. White walls and wooden tables lend a restrained air to the tiny, hushed space, while the tile floor and glass cabinets honor its past life as a bakery. In the same manner, the precisely made comfort food shows respectful devotion to old-time Portuguese recipes (soft-boiled egg with mushroom, Azores steak) while sometimes favoring modern interpretations. Alheira sausage, for instance, is a lush pork-veal blend whose savory smoothness plays off sweet tapioca spheres simmered in Port wine. The cod is equally worthy, thanks to a crunchy-sweet texture from cornbread crumbs and a Far East dose of umami using shiitake mushrooms. The banana cream dessert is served with shavings of pungent Queijo S\u00e3o Jorge. Dinner for two, without drinks, costs about 60 euros.10. Cars and Bars | 11 p.m.Directions to Park aren\u2019t promising: Walk into a downbeat concrete parking garage, take the graffiti-stained elevator to the top floor, and trudge up the ramp to the roof. But the payoff is a surprising oasis of trees, bushes and exotic flora with lovely views over Lisbon\u2019s hills. Within this well-planted former parking lot, an international crowd in eclectic footwear \u2014 boots to Birkenstocks, high heels to hightops \u2014 sips caipirinhas (6.50 euros) and ros\u00e9 wine from the Alentejo region (3.50 euros) from the dual bars.Sundays are sleepy in Lisbon \u2014 unless you discover Room 61 of the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, a repository of excellent European painting. That particular gallery shakes the soul. \u201cSalome,\u201d by Lucas Cranach the Elder, is an early 16th-century depiction of that celebrated seductress holding the grisly severed head of John the Baptist. Nearby, another disembodied head \u2014 a human skull \u2014 sits on the desk of a sunken-eyed, long-bearded St. Jerome in Albrecht D\u00fcrer\u2019s 1521 painting named for the saint. But the most unnerving image by far is Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s \u201cTriptych of the Temptations of Saint Anthony Abbot, the Betrayal of Christ and the Way to Calvary\u201d (1500), which unleashes a feverish nightmare of monsters and debauched humans in a fiery apocalypse. The garden cafe, which serves up cappuccino (1.70 euros) and river views, is your recovery room \u2014 and final glimpse of the ever-evolving city.An earlier version of this article included hotels for a different city, Antigua, Guatemala.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Markets Fall Around the World", "Date": "2015-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySigns of complacency were evident before stock markets around the world tumbled on Friday.European shares have been on a tear this year, even with Greece seemingly edging closer to default. Doubts about China\u2019s economy did not stop its stocks from more than doubling in the last 12 months. The United States market has been lukewarm this year, but the excitement seemed back on Thursday, after three companies carried out initial stock public offerings that rose sharply on their first day of trading.But the good times evaporated on Friday. The day\u2019s moves weren\u2019t large by recent standards, but the global nature of the swoon gave traders and analysts pause. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 23.81, or 1.1 percent, to close at 2,081.18.The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 279.47 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 17,826.30. At one point in the day, it was down as much as 357 points. The Dow is more or less flat for the year and down about 2.5 percent from the high, not adjusted for inflation, that it reached last month. The Nasdaq composite index fell 75.98, or 1.5 percent, to 4,931.81.Chinese stock futures, which allow traders to bet on future movements in shares, plunged on Friday. The sell-off occurred after Chinese market regulators on Friday announced changes that could restrict the supply of loans that investors use to finance stock trades and increase the amount of negative bets against Chinese stocks.Germany\u2019s DAX index declined 2.58 percent. Adding a chill to the market on Friday, the yield on the 10-year German government bond fell to 0.08 percent.Investors flock to German government bonds during periods of nervousness, making people willing to accept such low returns. The yield on the United States 10-year Treasury note, another safe haven investment, fell to 1.87 percent from 1.90 late Thursday.Some analysts said the markets had looked vulnerable to a sell-off.As shares have risen, the valuations on companies have become more expensive, which can make investors less likely to hold them if earnings disappoint. Volatility in the markets has also dropped in recent weeks, suggesting that investors thought that the outlook for stocks and bonds was predictable.\u201cIf there is a news item, the market reacts because of this vulnerability,\u201d Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said.Plenty of challenges remain for investors.Greece\u2019s clashes over its debts with other European leaders are not likely to disappear. If Greece were to default and drop out of the euro, global markets might be in for a period of strong turbulence. But even if the country strikes a deal, it may be weeks before an agreement is forged. But shares of American Express fell 4.4 percent on Friday after the company reported earnings on Thursday after the markets closed. Those companies, Etsy, an online marketplace for artisanal products; Virtu Financial, a high-frequency trading firm; and Party City, a party supplies company, all traded substantially higher on Thursday. On Friday, the stocks of Virtu and Party City rose. But Etsy shares fell 8.1 percent. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rushing to Stake a Claim on the Market Frontier", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStock markets in big emerging-market countries like China, Brazil and Russia have been sagging. But the returns have been splendid for their oft-overshadowed smaller siblings \u2014 frontier markets like Kazakhstan, Kenya and Kuwait.Mutual funds that invest in the frontiers have surged, according to Morningstar, returning an annualized average of 5.9 percent over the three years through March. By contrast, emerging-market funds have lost an annualized average of 0.3 percent in the same period.\u201cFund companies are always looking for the next thing to promote,\u201d said Patricia Oey, a senior analyst at Morningstar and the author of the report.Yet frontier mutual funds and E.T.F.s may not have a place in everyone\u2019s portfolio. \u201cIt can be hard to know what you\u2019re getting with a frontier fund, so it can be hard to know how it should perform and what role it will play in your portfolio,\u201d said Todd L. Rosenbluth, director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research at S&P Capital IQ.Short performance records mean that investors will not be able to see, for example, how a fund held up during a bear market like that of the 2008-9 financial crisis, he said. What\u2019s more, frontier mutual funds and E.T.F.s are as varied as the countries they invest in. Some buy only in the frontier markets, while others also hunt in smaller emerging markets like Peru and the Philippines, he said. Some also layer on companies that are listed in the developed world but operate mostly in frontier countries.\u201cI can\u2019t come up with two things with the same name that could be any more different than these two E.T.F.s,\u201d Mr. Rosenbluth said.Many frontier countries have been enjoying something of a peace dividend, said Mr. Bell at T. Rowe Price. A generation ago, quite a few were seized by some sort of conflict: civil war in Sri Lanka, border battles between Pakistan and India, the bloody breakup of the former Yugoslavia. \u201cAbout 50 countries in the \u201990s had conflicts,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, there are about 10. When there\u2019s not conflict, investment and economic growth can happen.\u201dProfessional investors often track whether groups of stocks rise and fall in tandem \u2014 whether their returns are correlated. They aim to combine groups that zig and zag independently, thus damping the volatility of a portfolio\u2019s average return. Frontier markets are not closely correlated with the others, and that can be an advantage: A study published in 2013 in The Journal of Portfolio Management found that adding a frontier E.T.F. to a portfolio diversified across developed and emerging markets achieved that.\u201cIf you look at the individual countries, frontier markets are risky,\u201d said Kuntara Pukthuanthong, one of the study\u2019s authors and a finance professor at the University of Missouri. \u201cBut when you build a diversified portfolio, because the market integration of frontiers with the other markets is lower, the risk of the whole portfolio is lower.\u201dYet there is no guarantee that economic growth will translate into investment wealth. Vanguard\u2019s studies have found little correlation between growth and stock-market returns, said Christopher B. Philips, who leads the client service team for the institutional investment group at Vanguard.\u201cThere should be a long-term link, but in the shorter term, the relationships are zero,\u201d he said. \u201cIn China, for example, we found that despite its strong growth, it has had a zero percent total return of its equity markets since inception.\u201dMr. Philips did not know why the hoped-for relationship had not arisen. He speculated there might be a disconnect between stocks and the broader economies. \u201cThe securities you can invest in differ from the drivers of the economy,\u201d he said. In Nigeria, for example, oil propels much of the growth, but state-run companies and foreign multinationals control much of the production.\u201cFrontiers shouldn\u2019t be your core investment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they can give you higher return potential and reduce the volatility in a portfolio.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": " The Value of a Classic in a Turbocharged World", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a world teeming with new varieties of mutual funds and exchange traded funds, the old-school balanced fund might seem like a Model T in a Tesla world.But classic balanced funds, which typically hold 60 percent or so in large-capitalization United States stocks and 40 percent in high-grade domestic bonds, don\u2019t seem to be suffering from obsolescence.The five-year average annualized return for moderate allocation funds \u2014 Morningstar\u2019s nomenclature for funds that take a balanced approach of owning stocks and bonds \u2014 is a none-too-shabby 8.9 percent.The granddaddy of balanced funds, the $90 billion Vanguard Wellington mutual fund, delivered a near 11 percent annualized gain over that stretch. Now in its ninth decade of operation, Vanguard Wellington offers a rare real-world, long-term track record through numerous bull and bear markets for both stocks and bonds, not some hypothetical back-tested result. A $10,000 investment at the fund\u2019s start in 1929 has grown at an annualized pace of 8.3 percent and is now worth nearly $9 million.If the $10,000 had merely grown at the rate of inflation, it would be worth about $138,000 today. Wellington\u2019s vanilla performance has been impressive.\u201cComplexity does not necessarily outperform,\u201d said Fran Kinniry, a principal in Vanguard\u2019s investment strategy group.Research from Mr. Kinniry\u2019s group shows that in the five years through 2013 the average annualized gain of hundreds of United States university and college investment endowment portfolios trailed a 60/40 balanced approach by about two percentage points, and over 10 years the 7.4 percent annualized gain for the balanced approach outpaced the gains of 90 percent of endowments. The model used by Vanguard divided the stock portion among domestic stocks (42 percentage points) and international equities (18 percent points).At the heart of their strategy, balanced funds give a slight overweight to stocks for their growth potential, which they couple with the ballast of bonds. That makes them a \u201cclassic hedge that will keep you out of a lot of trouble,\u201d said John S. Osterweis, founder and chief investment officer of Osterweis Capital Management.That\u2019s not faint praise. The ability to avoid bone-crushing losses in down markets is at least as important to long-term success as solid gains in rising ones. And that\u2019s a central function of a balanced approach.If you instead owned only stocks, you would have had to stomach 10 periods of losses of at least 25 percent and 46 stretches when the loss was at least 10 percent. For the 37-year period, the 60/40 approach delivered about 90 percent of the return of an all-equity portfolio with one-third less volatility.David W. Connelly, director of global product at MFS and author of the study, notes that the less bumpy ride of a balanced portfolio can help loss-phobic investors stay the course. The automatic rebalancing of the portfolio also helps.\u201cYou\u2019re not letting your winners run too long, and you\u2019re buying lower when markets are down,\u201d Mr. Connelly said. The upshot can be some virtuous inertia, as balanced fund investors seem less inclined to chase performance. Mr. Connelly found that in rolling 12-month periods for the five years through 2013, balanced fund investors had the lowest redemption rates among five broad types of funds, which also included domestic stock, foreign stock, municipal and taxable bond funds.WHILE balanced funds are certainly a viable option, there are trade-offs. Depending on your age, investment goal and appetite for risk, a static stock target of 60 percent may not be your personal Goldilocks portfolio.You\u2019re also likely to have a somewhat xenophobic portfolio, as classic balanced funds tend to traffic mostly in domestic stocks. The Vanguard Balanced Index fund is 100 percent domestic. Vanguard Wellington has 8 percent of its assets invested in foreign stocks. The $82 billion American Balanced fund and the $12 billion Dodge & Cox Balanced fund currently have 7 percent invested abroad. One outlier: The $4.2 billion T. Rowe Price Balanced fund recently had more than 20 percent of assets invested abroad.Moreover, owning bonds and stocks in separate funds or E.T.F.s (or individual issues for that matter) makes it easier to harvest tax losses, said Gary Schatsky, a financial adviser in Manhattan. It\u2019s also easier to calibrate the risk of shifting interest rates. \u201cI can choose a short-term bond fund for a client, but with a balanced fund, chances are I am going to get a bond portfolio with a longer duration,\u201d he said. The longer a fund\u2019s duration, the bigger its price declines when interest rates rise. The current average duration for moderate allocation funds in Morningstar\u2019s database is near five years.The bond side of the balanced fund may be a headwind for returns over the next decade. That\u2019s because the current yield for high-grade bonds foretells future returns. With the 10-year Treasury note currently yielding about 2 percent, it is mathematically impossible for high-grade bonds to deliver the same returns as in decades past, when yields were at least twice as high.But that doesn\u2019t change bonds\u2019 classic airbag role during market crashes. In the 2007-8 bear market that sent the S.&P. 500 down more than 55 percent, the average balanced fund lost just 40 percent, because high-grade bonds rose in value during the stock drop. Those were big losses but not nearly as big as in most pure stock funds.Still, some strategists say it\u2019s wise to lower expectations. Based on current market valuations, Research Affiliates, a money manager in Newport Beach, Calif., forecasts a 1 percent inflation-adjusted return over the next 10 years for a domestic 60/40 portfolio.The economics team at Vanguard isn\u2019t as dour, noting that a global balanced fund could generate inflation-adjusted returns in the range of 3 percent to 5 percent over the next decade. (Vanguard assumes that of the stock portion, 18 percentage points are in foreign stocks, and of the bond portion eight percentage points are in foreign bonds.) That\u2019s just for the next decade. As Wellington\u2019s long track record attests, for those who avoided moving their investment through feast and famine, keeping it simple has had a payoff.\u201cOld-fashioned tends to be seen as a bad thing, but a balanced approach is a classic solution that continues to work,\u201d Mr. Osterweis said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank Shakes Up Its Business, and Maybe Its Identity", "Date": "2015-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn fact, zealous regulators and aggressive law enforcement authorities have prompted most other European banks to curtail their operations in the United States. On Monday, Deutsche Bank responded to the tense atmosphere with a sweeping plan to shrink its investment bank and reduce its dependence on borrowed money.The changes probably make Deutsche Bank less of a threat to the global financial system. But they are sure to raise questions about whether Germany\u2019s signature bank can continue to compete in the same league as Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase.Mr. Jain and the bank\u2019s other co-chief executive, J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, insisted on Monday that they are not retreating from the idea of a universal bank that offers a full range of banking services to individuals and business worldwide. And they reaffirmed their determination to be a force on Wall Street.But since the financial crisis, European investment banks have steadily lost market share to their United States rivals. In the first quarter, European banks accounted for 30 percent of global investment banking revenue, according to the data provider Dealogic. That was the lowest share since Dealogic began keeping track in 1995.Deutsche Bank ranks sixth worldwide measured by investment banking revenue. The top five are all based in the United States: JPMorgan, Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup. In the United States market alone, Deutsche Bank is a mere ninth among investment banks.Roy C. Smith, a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, said that Deutsche Bank\u2019s best hope to compete with its American rivals would be to split off the investment banking activities. But that was not the plan presented on Monday.Deutsche Bank will sell its Postbank network of branches in Germany by listing the unit on the stock market next year. But it will continue to operate a network of branches with the Deutsche Bank brand in Germany and some other countries, albeit in streamlined form.Mr. Smith pointed out that the name of the reorganization plan, Strategy 2020, means that even if Deutsche Bank meets all its goals, it will still have been 12 years since the beginning of the financial crisis \u201cbefore they get to some kind of equilibrium.\u201dAbuse of interest rates and the failure to address the problem is one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.Investors clearly shared Mr. Smith\u2019s pessimism. Deutsche Bank shares sank 4.6 percent on Monday in Frankfurt trading.Regulators around the world, but especially in the United States, are demanding that all banks reduce risk. Deutsche Bank was particularly vulnerable because of its large exposure to businesses that can be lucrative in good times but toxic in bad, like derivatives contracts. The bank said on Monday that it would stop offering some kinds of derivatives and retreat from other risk businesses like commodities trading.He admitted on Monday that he shared the blame for what the United States and British authorities said was a failure to heed warnings that some traders were manipulating benchmarks used to set trillions of dollars in mortgages and other debt.\u201cThe conduct of those people was reprehensible, and I was their leader,\u201d Mr. Jain said. \u201cThere\u2019s no stepping back from that.\u201dAdding to the damage, Mr. Fitschen, the co-chief executive, must appear in court in Munich on Tuesday with four former top managers of Deutsche Bank to stand trial on charges they gave false testimony in a civil suit. The lawsuit was brought by a German media company that accused the bank of driving it into bankruptcy.Mr. Fitschen said on Monday that the charges were unjustified.The reorganization that was announced on Monday will also include raising the so-called leverage ratio, a measure of the bank\u2019s dependence on borrowed money, to 5 percent from 3.4 percent. (A higher number means the bank is using more of its own money and less debt.) United States regulators have been among the most zealous in insisting that banks reduce leverage.For Deutsche Bank, the change will entail a reduction of hundreds of billions of euros in the bank\u2019s use of borrowed funds. It also means that the bank will earn a lower return on the money it invests than in the past. The bank will aim for a 10 percent return on capital, down from a previous target of 12 percent and a far cry from the 25 percent return that Deutsche Bank sought to achieve before the financial crisis. In addition, the bank said it aimed to cut costs by 3.5 billion euros, or about $3.8 billion, a year.The cuts would seem to suggest that Deutsche Bank will have little choice but to join other European banks like UBS or Barclays in scaling back its American operations.But Mr. Jain argued that Deutsche Bank needed to be a force on Wall Street to serve blue-chip German companies that almost always have large operations in the United States. \u201cIt is critical for us to have a strong and credible presence in the U.S. in order to claim that we are a true global competitor,\u201d Mr. Jain said.True, he could point to a rebound in Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment banking unit during the last quarter. The bank said that revenue generated from trading stocks, bonds and currencies was the highest in years. Revenue from investment banking rose 15 percent, to \u20ac4.7 billion. Operating profit for the unit fell by more than half, to \u20ac643 million, after subtracting a portion of the penalty paid in the rate-fixing scandal.Mr. Jain said the bank will \u201cavoid trying to be all things to all people.\u201d But critics would say the bank, trapped in its image of itself as Germany\u2019s beachhead in the financial world, is still trying to do too much.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Questioning the Seaworthiness of Bond Funds", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors have embraced bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds as sound and solid places to keep their money. But that growing popularity rings alarm bells with some regulators, who worry that these same vehicles could become sources of instability in a future market crisis.\u201cThese funds now hold a much higher fraction of the available stock of relatively less liquid assets \u2014 such as high-yield corporate debt, bank loans and international debt \u2014 than they did before the financial crisis,\u201d the Fed said in the report. And as the funds expand, they may pose a threat, it said: \u201cTheir growth heightens the potential for a forced sale in the underlying markets if some event were to trigger large volumes of redemptions.\u201dThe Fed is essentially asking how smoothly bond E.T.F. shares will trade when markets are in turmoil, as they will surely be one day. It is also concerned that, if people start to panic, traditional fixed-income mutual funds will have trouble raising the cash they need to cover redemptions.These concerns have been fueled, in part, by the rapid expansion of bond E.T.F.s, which were introduced only a dozen years ago. By the end of January, they held assets of just over $308 billion, up from $57 billion in 2008. In contrast, fixed-income mutual funds, a fixture of the marketplace for decades, held about $3.5 trillion in assets at the end of January, up from about $3.2 trillion at the end of 2013.It\u2019s no wonder that mutual funds and E.T.F.s have become so popular: In almost every year since the 2008 financial crisis, bond E.T.F.s and mutual funds have performed well. Average bond E.T.F. returns, for example, hit 9.3 percent in 2009 and stayed strong through 2012, according to Morningstar. They moved slightly into the red in 2013, but rebounded to 4.5 percent last year and gained just over 1 percent in the first quarter of this year. Average bond mutual funds, which gained 17.7 percent in 2009, have trailed E.T.F.s a bit since then; the average bond fund gained 4.4 percent last year, and just under 1 percent in the first quarter.But although the funds have prospered, regulators are concerned about the nature of the underlying bond market, which is far less liquid and transparent than the robust market for stocks in the United States.\u201cBonds are like houses,\u201d said Dave Nadig, chief investment officer at the analytical website ETF.com. Like houses, he said, they are unique, some don\u2019t sell quickly or easily, and reliable price quotes can be hard to come by. By Mr. Nadig\u2019s estimate, there are more than 150,000 individual debt instruments outstanding. Of those, only a few thousand trade as frequently as once a day.As a result, he said, establishing perfectly accurate market prices for fixed-income securities with the frequency that many retail investors expect is impossible. \u201cHow would you propose the market determine a fair price for a Krispy Kreme bond that hasn\u2019t traded in four days?\u201dIndustry pricing services gather estimates of what that Krispy Kreme bond would actually fetch if it were sold. But those values may or may not be obtainable in the real world on a normal day, much less during a panic.Another worrisome fact of life in today\u2019s bond market is that many large financial institutions, wary of tighter risk standards imposed after 2008, are unwilling to hold a large inventory of bonds. This makes the overall market much less liquid than it was not long ago.The mutual fund and E.T.F. industry, on the other hand, is worried that regulatory concerns will give rise to wrongheaded regulations that will damage the retail market and deprive investors of popular, useful products.For example, in a report in late February, the Investment Company Institute, an industry trade group, said that all but 5 percent of the assets in long-term bond mutual funds were held by households, typically in retirement accounts, and that history has shown that \u201cretirement savers don\u2019t flee in hard financial times.\u201dMoreover, statistics provided by institute economists show that the share of total bond market assets held by these funds is lower than the regulatory worries might suggest.As of 2014, according to the institute, bond mutual funds, whose assets dwarf those of bond E.T.F.s, owned about 10 percent of the total supply of Treasury and government bonds and 26 percent of the supply of municipal bonds. In the high-yield bond market and some sections of the international bond market, already thinly traded and likely to be more troublesome in a future crisis, mutual funds hold about 22 percent of high-yield bonds and less than 1 percent of international bonds.Still, one significant problem is that the interaction between the funds and the underlying fixed-income markets can be quite complex. When it comes to E.T.F.s, for example, not even the regulators are in agreement about the liquidity risks they pose.IT\u2019S easy to see how even regulators could be fuzzy about how much liquidity there is in the E.T.F. market. The first question they meet is, \u201cWhich E.T.F. market?\u201dThat\u2019s because there are actually two markets \u2014 the primary market occupied by big institutions, and the secondary market where retail investors trade.This, briefly, is how it works. In the primary market, only big institutions (called \u201cauthorized participants\u201d) can do some important kinds of business with the E.T.F. sponsor. They can redeem shares to get a prorated portion of the fund\u2019s assets, or they can deliver a fresh supply of those assets to the sponsor in exchange for a stack of newly created E.T.F. shares.\u201cAuthorized participants are the linchpin of the E.T.F. ecosystem,\u201d said Ben Johnson, an analyst at Morningstar. \u201cThey intervene to create and redeem shares to keep market prices in line with underlying values.\u201dImagine, for example, that a bond E.T.F.\u2019s shares trade in the secondary market for $9 but their net asset value \u2014 that is, the value of the underlying bonds \u2014 is actually $10 a share. In such a case, authorized participants could buy the shares in the secondary market and redeem them in the primary market for full value, pocketing a dollar profit per share. Their purchases in the secondary market would, in time, drive up the price of those discounted shares.One dilemma noted by Mr. Johnson is that if panic selling were underway for whatever reason, the authorized participants who were expected to buy E.T.F. shares in the secondary market and exchange them for bonds from the underlying portfolio would instantly sell the bonds to lock in their profit. As a consequence, he said, no matter how well the primary market works, it cannot fully insulate the underlying bond market from the impact of panicky secondary-market selling. That has regulators worried.Individual investors may not be aware of these issues, though they should be, Mr. Nadig of ETF.com said.\u201cIt is important for investors to understand all of the aspects of liquidity for their E.T.F.s,\u201d he said. They should know what the long-term volume of secondary market trading in their fund\u2019s shares has been, because E.T.F.s with skimpy daily trading volume are especially vulnerable to large price gaps in turbulent times.Investors also need to understand the risks of holding E.T.F.s that, in turn, invest in less liquid assets like high-yield debt and foreign bonds. No amount of secondary market trading will prevent the E.T.F.s from losing money when the value of that underlying asset falls \u2014 and the less liquid the asset, the steeper its decline could be when the market falls.Finally, investors need to know that the second-by-second prices quoted for their fixed-income E.T.F. shares, and the daily prices reported for their bond mutual funds, typically do not entirely reflect purchases and sales in the underlying bond markets.Deeper solutions may not be forthcoming soon. Matthew Hougan, the president of ETF.com, who calls himself an \u201ceternal optimist,\u201d said he hoped that today\u2019s regulatory worries about liquidity would \u201cin the end, be refocused on reforming the bond market\u201d to make prices more reliable and trading more visible.But Mr. Nadig, his ETF.com colleague, said he found that unlikely. Bond prices \u201cultimately have to be set by market participants,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re not willing to do that, then no amount of regulatory hand-wringing\u201d can solve the basic liquidity problem.That problem may not be evident every day. But bond E.T.F. and mutual fund investors may want to remember that, by the time any serious pricing and liquidity problems do arise, it may be too late for them to worry.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank Profit Falls on Legal Costs", "Date": "2015-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest bank, said on Sunday that its net profit fell by half in the first quarter as it absorbed the legal costs of past wrongdoing by bank employees.Profit in the first three months of the year was 559 million euros (about $608 million), Deutsche Bank said, down from 1.1 billion euros a year earlier. Although revenue rose 24 percent, to 10.4 billion euros, in the quarter, profit fell because of the 1.5 billion euros that the bank set aside to cover a legal settlement with United States and British regulators and law enforcement authorities.The impact of the penalty overshadowed a rebound in Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment banking unit. The bank said that revenue generated from trading stocks, bonds and currencies was the best it has been in years. Revenue from investment banking rose 15 percent, to 4.7 billion euros, but profit plunged more than half to 643 million euros after subtracting the penalty.Deutsche Bank \u201cis much stronger than when we began our journey in 2012,\u201d J\u00fcrgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain, the co-chief executives, said in a statement, referring to the year when they took office.\u201cWe embark on the next phase of our strategy from a position of strength,\u201d they said. That was a reference to a planned reorganization of the bank, broad outlines of which were disclosed on Friday.The decision to sell Postbank, which offers retail banking services from German post offices, signals a retreat from Deutsche Bank\u2019s ambition to be a so-called universal bank, serving residents of small towns in Germany as well as hedge funds on Wall Street.Mr. Jain and Mr. Fitschen have scheduled a news conference for Monday morning in Frankfurt to discuss the reorganization in more detail. They are expected to say that Deutsche Bank will retain a network of branches in Germany and some other countries using the Deutsche Bank brand.The branches will focus on services to wealthy clients, according to German news reports. Postbank, by contrast, offers basic banking services at German post offices.Deutsche Bank had previously set aside money to cover the investigation into interest rate fixing, but increased the amount by 1.5 billion euros last week after the penalty turned out to be larger than expected.Deutsche Bank faces other legal troubles, including investigations into allegations of currency manipulation and violations of United States sanctions against countries like Iran. The bank said on Sunday that it still had reserves of 4.8 billion euros at the end of the quarter to cover future penalties and legal expenses.Pressure from regulators has made it more difficult for Deutsche Bank to reconcile risky investment banking activities with the steadier but less profitable business of taking deposits and writing loans. That led to the decision to spin off Postbank, which it acquired in 2008.Deutsche Bank has been constrained by perceptions that the investment banking business, based in London and New York, risked the savings of ordinary Germans.Deutsche Bank is one of the last big banks in Europe to bow to pressure from regulators to become less risky and to rely less on borrowed money. Other banks like UniCredit in Italy, UBS in Switzerland and Barclays in Britain have sharply reduced the size of their investment banks and their Wall Street profiles.On Friday, representatives of workers protested the spinoff of Postbank, saying the reorganization would lead to job cuts.But representatives of Deutsche Bank employees, who, in accordance with German law, hold half the seats on the supervisory board, said later that they supported the plan.The union that represents Deutsche Bank employees, known as ver.di, said that selling Postbank on the stock market offered the best chance to preserve jobs.\u201cAgainst a background of increasing regulatory requirements,\u201d the union said in a statement on Friday, \u201c\u2018business as usual\u2019 is no longer possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Consumers Thrive as Oil Shares Dive", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDatapointsA 50 percent drop in the price of crude oil in a matter of months is a highly unusual occurrence. But that\u2019s what happened from the beginning of July 2014 to the end of this March. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 5 percent in that period, but individual parts of the market reacted in very different ways.Energy stocks, battered by worries about weaker earnings, followed the price of oil downward: Since last July, the S.&P. 500 energy index has lost 22 percent.Then there are the big winners: consumer discretionary stocks. When oil prices drop, gasoline prices do too, and many consumers have more money to spend. Investors have bid up stocks of companies like Nike and Walt Disney on the assumption that people will be funneling more cash into such nonessential products and services as apparel and entertainment. And so, since July 1, 2014, the S.&P. 500 consumer discretionary index has increased 12 percent.Among exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, the trend has been similar. For instance, the largest oil futures fund, the United States Oil Fund, or USO, has dropped 57 percent since July, while the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund, or XLY, has posted a 12 percent gain.Lately, some investors have been buying oil E.T.F.s in anticipation of an oil price recovery. In the six months through March, USO had a net inflow of almost $2.9 billion compared with an outflow of $216 million during the same period a year earlier. \u201cWhen E.T.F. investors see falling oil prices, their response is to buy oil and bet that the average consumer is heading to Disneyland for a vacation,\u201d said Matt Hougan, president of the analytical website ETF.com.Those expectations could be thwarted by consumer behavior, however. Retail spending figures suggest that consumers may not be spending very much of their oil windfall after all.If that continues, consumer discretionary stocks could fall out of favor. And at some point, the oil market is likely to trend upward. But betting on the timing of all of this is risky behavior indeed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yoox to Merge With Net-a-Porter in All-Share Deal", "Date": "2015-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMergers & AcquisitionsLONDON \u2014 The Yoox Group said on Tuesday that it had agreed to merge with its luxury e-commerce rival Net-a-Porter in an all-share deal.The transaction would create an online luxury fashion retailer from two companies that combined to post revenue of 1.3 billion euros, or about $1.4 billion, in 2014, Yoox said. The new company would be called Yoox Net-a-Porter Group.Net-a-Porter\u2019s website sells clothing, jewelry, shoes and other accessories from top designers and labels, including Alexander McQueen, Dolce & Gabbana and Valentino. It also publishes Porter, a magazine that lets readers buy featured items.Yoox sells off-season luxury goods in its online store, as well as trendier brands on thecorner.com.In an interview by telephone from Milan, Mr. Marchetti said that he valued Net-a-Porter\u2019s editorial skills. \u201cEditorial content has never been our strength or priority at Yoox,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is very important for social media, which is driving millennial sales in the e-commerce space. Smartphones now make up 50 percent of the traffic on Yoox\u2019s websites.\u201dThose editorial skills, he said, would also bolster Yoox\u2019s business building and operating websites for luxury brands, including those of rivals to Compagnie Financi\u00e8re Richemont, the Swiss parent company of Net-a-Porter. Yoox already powers sites for more than 30 brands, including Armani, Zegna, Lanvin and Valentino, and has a joint venture with Kering to power the websites for many of its luxury brands including Bottega Veneta, YSL and Alexander McQueen.Mr. Marchetti would serve as the chief executive of the combined company, and Natalie Massenet, the founder of Net-a-Porter, would be its executive chairwoman.\u201cToday, we open the doors to the world\u2019s biggest luxury fashion store,\u201d Ms. Massenet said. \u201cIt is a store that never closes, a store without geographical borders, a store that connects with, inspires, serves and offers millions of style-conscious global consumers access to the finest designer labels in fashion.\u201dUnder the deal, Richemont would receive 50 percent of the combined company\u2019s shares and hold 25 percent of its voting rights. It would also be limited to two of the company\u2019s 12 independent directors. Richemont acquired a majority interest in Net-a-Porter in 2010 in a deal that valued the e-commerce company at 350 million pounds, or about $519 million.Both websites would remain separate, Mr. Marchetti said, and Net-a-Porter\u2019s headquarters would remain in London. The companies expect annual cost savings of about \u20ac60 million by 2018, which would be the third year of the completed merger, primarily from combining logistics and technology operations. Plans are, he said, to enlarge warehouses in Bologna, Italy, and in London, and to combine logistics operations in the United States, which is the biggest market for both companies, accounting for 28 percent of combined sales.Analysts said the merger might herald further consolidation in the luxury retail sector.\u201cI would expect this could prompt more consolidation of pure play retailers,\u201d said Luca Solca, the BNP Exane Paribas analyst, referring to e-commerce businesses without freestanding stores. \u201cAfter a honeymoon with the market, investors are seeing that making money as a pure play is not easy. Hence this could prompt more companies to improve their chances through higher scale.\u201dIn a note to clients, the Citibank luxury equity analyst Thomas Chauvet wrote that he expected the deal was \u201clogical\u201d for Richemont and could renew speculation that Richemont was looking at disposing of other noncore fashion brands like Dunhill, Lancel and Chlo\u00e9.The transaction is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval and is set to close in September. Yoox would remain listed in Milan and based in Italy.If the transaction is completed, the combined company will seek to raise up to \u20ac200 million in capital to fund future growth opportunities.Yoox was advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firms d\u2019Urso Gatti e Bianchi, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Richemont was advised by Lazard and Nomura, and the law firms Slaughter and May and Bonelli Erede Pappalardo.Chad Bray reported from London, and Vanessa Friedman from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall Street Banks\u2019 Mutual Funds Can Lag on Returns", "Date": "2015-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacing challenges on all fronts, Wall Street banks are pinning some of their hopes on a relatively simple business opportunity: creating mutual funds for ordinary savers. Over the last few years, an expanding line of mutual funds created by the likes of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase has been drawing billions of dollars from investors looking to earn a good return on their retirement money. For the banks, the fees that the funds generate have been among the few consistent bright spots of growth in a time of retrenchment on Wall Street.There is, though, one big problem with all the growth: History has not shown these banks to be particularly good at managing mutual funds, and their clients have paid the cost.Most of the funds run by each of the four largest banks in the business \u2014 Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo \u2014 have underperformed their basic benchmarks over the last 10 years, according to analysis of industry data done for The New York Times by Morningstar. And that does not include the funds that went out of business because of poor performance.While some of the banks have seen better performance over more recent periods \u2014 in which the stock markets have been steadily rising \u2014 the investment products created by Wall Street\u2019s biggest name, Goldman, have been particularly disappointing, with only 12 percent of the bank\u2019s mutual funds outperforming their relative benchmarks over the last 10 years, and 35 percent over the last five years.\u201cIt\u2019s a good business for them \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean it is a good investment,\u201d said Larry Swedroe, director of research at Buckingham Asset Management. Mr. Swedroe began his career on bank trading desks but has become an advocate for more passive investment strategies.There is a wide body of research showing how hard it is for actively managed mutual funds \u2014 like the ones run by the banks \u2014 to outperform low-cost funds like the ones that invest in a benchmarked index of stocks and bonds.The banks have suggested in marketing materials that their investing prowess differentiates their offerings from the pack. But the relatively high fees that banks charge for their mutual funds subtract from the ultimate returns and make it harder to compete against their most successful competitor in recent years, the giant fund manager Vanguard, a company that prides itself on offering low-cost funds.Thanks in large part to its low fees, 80 percent of Vanguard\u2019s actively managed funds survived and outperformed a majority of peers during the last 10 years. At Goldman, only 24 percent did so, and only 30 percent of Wells Fargo funds did.A Morningstar analyst for Goldman funds, Laura Lallos, said, \u201cWe do not consider their overall long-term performance to be a success any way you look at it.\u201dThe underwhelming performance of most funds is rarely mentioned when the banks discuss the big business opportunity they are going after in the so-called asset management sector.When Goldman\u2019s chief financial officer, Harvey M. Schwartz, spoke about Goldman\u2019s \u201cstrategic initiative to grow asset management\u201d on his most recent call with investors, he said that the \u201cteam\u2019s done a great job.\u201d For Goldman\u2019s bottom line, the business has indeed been doing well. During 2014, the company\u2019s funds drew $73 billion of new money from investors, increasing revenues in the investment management division by 11 percent over the previous year. Goldman has nearly doubled the number of mutual funds it has offered over the last decade.When Goldman and other banks discuss the performance of their funds, they tend to use statistics that are weighted by how much money is in each of the funds at the time of measurement. On this basis, Goldman says that 75 percent of its clients\u2019 money is in mutual funds that have been in the top half of competitors over the last five years.\u201cThere are many ways to determine the performance of mutual funds, but we choose to consistently focus on figures that we believe most accurately reflect the investment performance that our clients experience,\u201d said David Wells, a Goldman spokesman.Darin Oduyoye, a spokesman for JPMorgan, says that it, too, chooses to look at fund performance based on where client money is at the current moment. He said that looking at the absolute number of funds that have underperformed is \u201cmisleading and does not reflect where our clients are actually invested.\u201d The approach used by the banks, though, is not favored by researchers because it skews the figures to where money is now, even if the money just entered top-performing funds and did not experience recent gains. Studies have shown that investors tend to put money into investments after periods of outperformance and then miss that outperformance.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have acknowledged that their funds, broadly, have not been stellar in the past, but both companies have recently made big efforts to reshape their teams and improve the returns. That has helped increase the number of funds at both companies that have beaten their benchmarks over the last three and five years, though the outperformance slipped again during the last year.Even when they do underperform, the funds pay off for the banks because investors pay the fees no matter what the returns are. An investor, for example, who put $10,000 into Goldman\u2019s mutual fund for medium-size companies, with the ticker GCMAX \u2014 one of the most popular Goldman funds among ordinary investors \u2014 would pay around $1,143 in fees over five years, including a $500 upfront fee. That is about 10 times what it would have cost if the money had been in a comparable fund at Vanguard, even though the Goldman fund would have led to returns that were 6 percent lower than the Vanguard fund over the last five years.Wall Street has a long and troubled history of moving into, and out of, the mutual fund business. In the 1990s, many of the big banks built up large families of mutual fund families that they marketed to clients of their brokerage divisions.In the decade that followed, though, several banks faced investigations and fines for encouraging their brokers to sell the bank\u2019s proprietary investment products even when they underperformed funds provided by outside companies. This was one of the factors that led Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, which is now a part of Bank of America, to sell off their mutual fund operations in 2005 and 2006.Today, the banks that kept their mutual fund businesses continue to offer those funds through their in-house brokers and advisers. All the banks have said that they do not rely heavily on selling their funds to in-house clients, but none of them provide data on how common it is.JPMorgan Chase is currently facing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission on accusations that it encouraged its brokers to sell the company\u2019s proprietary mutual funds even when they underperformed competitors.JPMorgan has, on the whole, had more success than the other big banks in running mutual funds.Over the last five years, 58 percent of its mutual funds beat their benchmarks, and 53 percent over the last year.The banks have occasionally acknowledged the difficulty that their mutual funds have in outperforming lower-cost alternatives that passively invest in an index of stocks or bonds. A report distributed by Morgan Stanley to its financial advisers last year said that \u201caggregate long-term performance and fees both favor passive over active\u201d management.The Morgan Stanley report says that investors can benefit from actively managed mutual funds by carefully choosing funds that focus on areas where it is easier for active managers to outperform, like international and small company stocks.The difficulty, according to advocates of passive investment management like Mr. Swedroe, is that once an area is viewed as fertile ground for active management, the competition heats up and the chances of outperformance go down.\u201cAs the competition gets tougher,\u201d Mr. Swedroe said, \u201cit gets harder and harder to generate great performance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trader as Scapegoat ", "Date": "2015-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorA BRITISH trader, Navinder Singh Sarao, is facing extradition to the United States. Federal prosecutors accuse him of having significantly contributed to the \u201cflash crash\u201d of May 6, 2010, in which major American stock markets plunged dramatically in a matter of minutes. Prosecutors also say that he manipulated prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for years by \u201cspoofing,\u201d or placing orders that he intended to cancel before they were filled. In fact, this is a common activity in equities markets today. The prosecution of Mr. Sarao is arbitrary, and his contribution to the flash crash was negligible.The market that Mr. Sarao stands accused of manipulating is among the world\u2019s most liquid. Traders can buy and sell contracts that are bets on the future value of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock-price index. How exactly did Mr. Sarao manage to single-handedly manipulate a market with tens of thousands of participants and billions in daily trading volume? According to the complaint, filed in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois, he placed multiple large orders to sell contracts at prices slightly above the best prevailing offer. The goal was to create an impression of considerable selling pressure, in the hope that this would drive prices down. Mr. Sarao could then buy at prices that he had himself played a role in depressing, only to sell moments later once he had canceled his initial orders and prices had recovered. In describing this activity, the complaint refers to \u201cbogus orders\u201d designed to \u201ctrick other market participants\u201d by creating \u201ca false appearance of increased supply\u201d and preventing \u201clegitimate forces of supply and demand from operating properly.\u201d This language reflects a na\u00efve understanding of modern finance. Our markets are full of bogus orders that create a false appearance of demand or supply and that cannot be traded against by ordinary investors. Most of these are placed not by traders like Mr. Sarao but by high-frequency traders using algorithms to implement complex strategies. Their strategies combine traditional market-making functions (such as the posting of buy and sell orders at a small spread) with speculation based on short-term price forecasts. They rely on the timely acquisition and rapid processing of incoming market data. By selectively altering this data, Mr. Sarao was attempting to trigger behavior that would net him a quick profit. But this process of consolidation is not instantaneous, and high-frequency traders have invested huge sums to receive and react to information at individual exchanges a few milliseconds before it has been aggregated and made available to others. As a result, orders are not always fully processed in the sequence in which they arrive at the market. In the time it takes for a partially filled order to reach a second destination, firms can modify orders and make trades at multiple venues. And they can insert themselves between buyers and sellers with compatible orders that have yet to be matched, thus providing liquidity where none is needed. These practices reduce the incentives to analyze fundamental information about securities. They also involve the placement of orders that are not intended to result in trades \u2014 which, in the case of Mr. Sarao, is allegedly a criminal act. So why was Mr. Sarao singled out? Probably because his strategy was transparent, and his account relatively small. Larger firms that combine many strategies with evolving algorithms will not display so clear a signature. Mr. Sarao made no pretense at market making and no attempt to disguise his strategy. But the strategy itself was not new. If regulators and prosecutors are serious about enforcement of securities laws, they should focus on the largest players in the fragmented markets for stocks and not on an individual, acting alone, who managed to fool an algorithm.

{"Headline": "Health Care Has Been This Quarter\u2019s Elixir for Stock Funds", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe key to success for many stock funds this year has been simple: Buy health care.While the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ended the first quarter up just 0.6 percent, shares of health care companies gained 7 percent, continuing a trend that has been quietly unfolding for years.As a result, some of the best-performing stock funds lately have been those with larger-than-average stakes in pharmaceuticals, biotech, managed care and other medical-related industries that collectively make up around 15 percent of the broad market.\u201cHealth care is probably the area I\u2019ve added the most in since I took over this portfolio a year ago,\u201d says Joseph B. Fath, manager of the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock fund, which has one-fifth of its assets in the sector. The fund soared 6 percent in the first quarter, beating 93 percent of other large growth funds, according to Morningstar.Portfolios that focus exclusively on health care stocks \u2014 especially biotech companies \u2014 posted even better returns. The First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech exchange-traded fund is already up 16 percent since the start of January and 54 percent over the last 12 months.\u201cIn the last four years, the health care sector has been in one of the great stealth sector bull markets I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer for the Leuthold Group, an investment management firm based in Minneapolis.Since March 2011, health care stocks have generated total returns of nearly 150 percent, doubling the gains of the broad market. At the same time, biotech shares have more than quadrupled in value. To some, this rally is beginning to resemble the run that technology stocks enjoyed in the late 1990s, though this sector has received far less attention.What accounts for health care\u2019s resurgence? Money managers cite several developments in recent years.For starters, the wave of patent expirations that plagued big pharmaceutical companies in the 2000s appears to have subsided, allowing the industry\u2019s earnings to stabilize. \u201cOnce pharma started to get healthy, it became easy for portfolio managers to look at biotech,\u201d said Alex Winogradoff, head of health care equities research at TIAA-CREF.BIOTECH has always had a reputation for being high risk. \u201cThese companies always seemed to be raising money but never seemed to generate cash flow,\u201d Mr. Winogradoff said.But that perception is beginning to change, as several big companies, including Amgen, Biogen and Gilead Sciences, \u201care generating enormous amounts of cash flow\u201d and profits, he added.Two of the biggest-selling drugs last year belonged to biotech companies. Humira, which is AbbVie\u2019s autoimmune treatment, generated $12.5 billion in sales in 2014 while Gilead\u2019s relatively new hepatitis C treatment, Sovaldi, brought in $10.3 billion.Gilead is now among the top holdings of Thornburg Value, which recently held 21 percent of its assets in the health care sector.Connor Browne, co-manager of the Thornburg Value fund, noted that it invested in three types of companies: basic value plays, emerging franchises and consistent earners. He said the fund originally invested in Gilead as an emerging franchise, but the stock had since been reclassified as a consistent earner.Over the last five years, the company\u2019s earnings have grown nearly 40 percent annually. As a result, even though the stock has gained 34 percent a year since 2010, Gilead shares trade at a modest price-to-earnings ratio of less than 10 because of those faster-growing profits.Of course, the same can\u2019t be said for the entire health care sector.Robert S. Burnstine, co-manager of the Aston/Fairpointe Focused Equity fund, said, \u201cThree years ago, health care was a great place to be.\u201dBack then, he said, 27 percent of his portfolio was held in the sector, and those health care stocks traded at an average P/E ratio of about 13, based on forecast forward 12-month earnings.But \u201chealth care prices generally aren\u2019t cheap anymore,\u201d Mr. Burnstine noted.Today he keeps only about 15 percent of his fund\u2019s assets in health stocks, and the shares he owns have a projected P/E of about 18.This reflects a similar trend in the broader health care universe. Medical stocks in the S.&P. 500 currently trade at an average P/E of 18.8, according to Bloomberg, versus 17.7 for the broad market.Mr. Browne agrees that \u201con an absolute basis, we\u2019re getting up there in terms of valuation levels.\u201d However, relative to other non-economically sensitive areas of the market, \u201cvaluations look cheaper while growth opportunities look better,\u201d he said.Shares of consumer staples companies \u2014 makers of basic household goods like toothpaste and soap \u2014 trade at an average P/E ratio of 20. Yet consumer sector earnings are expected to grow 7 percent annually over the next three to five years, versus nearly 10 percent for health care.Michael S. Tung, co-manager of the Turner Medical Sciences Long/Short fund, said \u201cthere\u2019s still value to be found in health care.\u201d He points to areas such as the specialty pharmaceutical business, where mergers and acquisitions are heating up.He cautions, though, that valuations are significantly higher among small biotechnology stocks. \u201cSome of the valuations are absolutely obscene,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these companies are being priced as if every drug is going to get approved.\u201dStill, many investors think health care\u2019s run can keep going, at least in the short term.The low-interest-rate environment continues to drive an M.&A. boom in this sector, driven by aggressive cost-cutters like Valeant Pharmaceuticals International.Until acquisitions and earnings growth subside \u2014 or until another sector of the economy excites Wall Street enough to start absorbing all the new money heading into health care \u2014 this rally is likely to keep going, Mr. Winogradoff of TIAA-CREF said.\u201cFundamentally,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are probably in the sixth inning of a nine-inning game.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In the 1970s, the gate went down, and it stayed down.Even after the neighborhood began to change \u2014 the derelict Ansonia Clock Company building was converted into lofts; the flats-fixed shop became a fancy food store; the restaurant Talde opened across the street \u2014 the storefront at 367 Seventh Avenue remained mysteriously closed. People who had lived on the block long enough knew it had something to do with the building\u2019s owner, a short, rotund man who had lived above the storefront with his wife in the 1980s. His name was Leo J. Bates. They saw him come in an old Chrysler and go through the side door, but it wasn\u2019t clear what went on inside. All they knew was that he did not want to rent the storefront out. A veterinarian with an office on the block inquired and got a one-line note: \u201cWhat about \u2018No\u2019 don\u2019t you understand?\u201d Mr. Bates refused all offers, even after he and his wife moved to the suburbs. Some speculated he wanted to avoid a tax increase. Others thought he wanted to sell the building with the storefront empty. But the years went by, and he never put it on the market. When he died, two years ago, the gate was still down. For 35 years, the storefront had kept Mr. Bates\u2019s secret.Behind the black gate was a world of color, hundreds of abstract works created and hidden away by Mr. Bates, who had a promising start as a painter in the 1970s before renouncing the art world and retreating to his storefront to paint.When the gate was lifted, the front window bore traces of the butcher\u2019s era \u2014 \u201cChoice Meats\u201d and \u201cSeafood\u201d in silver lettering on the glass, which the restaurateurs have replicated. But there was no sign of the paintings composed there: delicate geometric forms in rich pinks, yellows and purples.\u201cLeo Bates was an artist and he used it as a studio for many years,\u201d Mrs. Bates said of her husband. \u201cIt had 12-foot ceilings and it was suitable for him to paint. He did these wonderful abstract paintings.\u201dShe went on: \u201cHow would I describe it to a blind person? I would give them a pyramid or a triangle or a branch and say, try to imagine hundreds of these on a wall.\u201d Leo J. Bates was born in Pittsburgh in 1944. His father was a steelworker; his mother worked in a factory. He attended Carnegie Mellon \u2014 then called Carnegie Institute of Technology \u2014 on a scholarship. He moved to Manhattan around 1968. He lived in a loft on Grand Street and painted, mainly triangles. As a child, Mr. Bates had loved the corners of rooms and the peaked rooftops visible from his bedroom window. And the triangle had a religious dimension for a former Roman Catholic schoolboy. Into the 1970s, a time when the art world was discovering conceptual art and installation, Mr. Bates kept turning out interlocking triangles in pale earth tones.\u201cWe were all doing different things,\u201d Mr. Tschinkel said. \u201cLeo was doing these line drawings, with triangles. I was doing these string things \u2014 with strings stretched on the wall. And Janet Fish was doing her still lifes even then. Frank Viner was doing knitted things. He loved to knit.\u201d Ours was at the outer limits of the New York art world. But it was a small world, \u201cand we were all young and working and everyone was interested in what people were doing,\u201d Ms. Fish said, adding, \u201cPeople went around to these shows.\u201d After Ours closed, some of the artists opened another cooperative gallery, 55 Mercer Street. Mr. Bates exhibited his work there and at 112 Greene Street, a gallery associated with the blossoming of SoHo, and at the Whitney Museum Art Resources Center, a converted warehouse on the Lower East Side. He won a state grant. But it didn\u2019t help Mr. Bates to break through. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d Mr. Rappaport said. \u201cAnd I think that was the most painful thing for Leo.\u201d \u201cThe whole notion of a season or two relates to Leo \u2014 you thought you were somewhere and all of a sudden you realize you\u2019re nowhere,\u201d Mr. Rappaport added. \u201cYou\u2019re nowhere.\u201dMs. Fish said: \u201cEverybody was having a hard time at that time. It wasn\u2019t just him.\u201d But Mr. Bates\u2019s failure to advance pained him particularly. He had been jovial, sociable \u2014 \u201ca happy fat man,\u201d as Mr. Rappaport put it. But by the late 1970s, he was disillusioned. As SoHo boomed, Mr. Bates became more alienated. His working-class roots were at odds with the culture enveloping the scene he once knew. \u201cThe glitz, glitter and boutiques. It became about fashion, money,\u201d said his wife, a librarian who had lived with Mr. Bates in his Grand Street loft throughout the \u201970s. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t something that Leo...\u201d her voice broke off. \u201cHe was a painter,\u201d she said.And in practical terms, he could not afford to stay. When he lost the lease on the loft, Mr. Bates decided to withdraw. In November 1978, he sold a batch of paintings. Using the proceeds, he made a down payment on 367 Seventh Avenue in Park Slope, moved into the apartment above the storefront and all but vanished.\u201cThat\u2019s the last time he sold anything,\u201d Mrs. Bates said. He was 34. In the following years, with the help of his wife\u2019s family, he bought two more walk-ups on the same block in Park Slope, and he became, at least in the eyes of the world, a landlord. In Manhattan, he soon faded from people\u2019s minds. He didn\u2019t show up at Fanelli\u2019s anymore, Ms. Fish said, and \u201cif you didn\u2019t see the person there, you just lost touch.\u201d In 1982, Mr. Bates went to a closing party for a show of Mr. Rappaport\u2019s work on Downing Street in the West Village. As Mr. Rappaport recalled, Mr. Bates was upset with him, because Mr. Rappaport had used a small gift from his father to take out an advertising spread in Artforum magazine to promote the show. \u201cFairly early in the evening, Leo got up after having a few drinks and he said: \u2018Richard is a fool. He just demonstrated how closed the art world is and what a fool I am to even try,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Rappaport remembered. \u201cAnd he picked up a serving plate and hurled it at one of my paintings on the wall.\u201d The two never spoke again.Mr. Bates had a few paintings in group shows in the early \u201980s, but from the time he moved to Brooklyn, virtually all that people saw in his hand were the signs he hung outside his buildings: apartment available, inquire inside.\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk to anyone about the art,\u201d Mrs. Bates said. Mrs. Bates worked in a private library at Bank of America, and they lived on her salary and their income from rentals, which Mr. Bates invested in stocks. But if Mr. Bates had stopped hanging out with painters, he had not stopped painting. In Brooklyn, he painted and drew obsessively. Asked why her husband had stopped selling his work, Mrs. Bates said: \u201cHe wanted to keep his body of work together. He wanted to show the progression.\u201dShe did not say he hoped he would one day be discovered. But his meticulous documentation suggests as much. He dated each canvas and made slides of each painting. For a time, he set up a tripod and photographed each brush stroke in a painting. He made stop-motion animated films from them.But in the moment, Mr. Bates did not want to share his work. He feared he would be copied. And until his small memorial two years ago, Mrs. Bates said, almost no one saw it. \u201cMe, the carpenter who rented the garage, maybe a few friends,\u201d she said.\u201cReally, no one.\u201dHe applied for a few grants, but was passed over and settled into obscurity. As for the artists and collectors he had left behind in Manhattan, \u201cit\u2019s possible people thought he completely disappeared,\u201d she said.They did. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what happened to him,\u201d said Mr. Tschinkel, his friend from the Bowery years. \u201cPeople would ask, of course. But I had no idea. Somebody told me he moved to Co-op City.\u201d When the couple arrived in Park Slope, shuttered storefronts were the norm. The buildings were in disrepair. There were few businesses. The area south of Ninth Street was known as \u201cEl Barrio\u201d and the most visited spot was a corner where drug dealers kept long hours. Every day, Mrs. Bates walked gingerly to the F train station to commute to Midtown. Mr. Bates fed their cats and headed downstairs to paint.The storefront was 20 feet across and divided in two. (A wall had been raised when the couple briefly entertained the idea of letting a friend open a lamp shop.) The front room, which faced onto Seventh Avenue, was Mr. Bates\u2019s studio. The original tin ceiling was full of holes. The floor had missing boards. He installed extra lights and pinned his canvases to the walls. The back room had a desk beside a single window covered with translucent tarp, and a shelf for storage.Slowly, a new style emerged. He abandoned the simple triangle patterns, which one reviewer had compared to \u201cthe efforts of a determined and an industrious child,\u201d for sharp diagonal lines and complex figures. He left behind earth tones for eye-popping colors. They were carefully layered, so they appeared to almost vibrate on the canvas, like light from a prism. \u201cHe tried to replicate the kind of movement you get from many frames in an animation, on one canvas,\u201d Mrs. Bates said.When he finished a painting, he rolled up the canvas and slid it into the large shelving unit in the adjacent room.Outside, he was seen as a cranky landlord. He broke up fights between neighborhood boys. He protected a straggly bush on his corner, and when the city wanted him to install concrete sidewalks, he fought to preserve the bluestone slabs instead. (After he died, the bush was torn out; the stone sidewalks remain.)Sharon Peters, who moved in across the street in 1978, said, \u201cHe was like a regular fixture on the corner.\u201d He stood out in the neighborhood not because of his work, but because of his politics. \u201cI remember Leo as an interesting character,\u201d Ms. Peters said. \u201cHis politics were very conservative. When we moved here, that was his reputation. This was a very liberal place.\u201d Other than his wife, the only person who knew what Mr. Bates did in the storefront was Phil Englander, a carpenter. Mr. Englander began renting the garage behind the storefront in 1987. He helped Mr. Bates maintain his buildings for decades; in exchange, Mr. Bates did not raise his rent. He also became Mr. Bates\u2019s friend. Mr. Bates loved talking about his passions \u2014 politics, Bob Dylan, the Renaissance painter Perugino. He was voluble and could be funny. He could also be \u201cvolcanic,\u201d Mr. Englander said, adding, \u201cIt didn\u2019t take much to set him off.\u201dAt the end of 1987, nine years after they arrived in Brooklyn, the couple rented an apartment in the Westchester County village Hastings-on-Hudson, seeking quiet, and Mr. Englander became the de facto superintendent of the Seventh Avenue buildings.As more businesses started to sprout on the block, people often asked Mr. Englander about the storefront. \u201cOnce a month it would happen,\u201d he said. But Mr. Bates told him not to give out his number. \u201cLeo didn\u2019t want to talk.\u201dMr. Bates\u2019s paintings remained in the storeroom, tucked into the shelving unit, piled on top of a cabinet, stacked against a wall. When a tenant upstairs asked permission to install a washing machine, Mr. Bates said absolutely not.Mr. Bates died of lung cancer in 2013, just three months after his disease was diagnosed. (He didn\u2019t smoke; his wife did.) He was 69. By that point, they were living in Westport, Conn. After he died, Mrs. Bates rounded up the paintings from Park Slope and took them home. She counted them, and concluded that in his lifetime, her husband had made more than 400 paintings, of which he had sold only a few dozen. On a recent afternoon, she climbed up the stairs of the home in Westport.She opened the door to a small room at the top of the stairs. The blinds were down, to protect what was inside: dozens of long, cardboard tubes stacked on shelves and piled on the floor. Around each tube, Mr. Bates had rolled four or five paintings. The tubes held hundreds of paintings.Looking at Mr. Bates\u2019s work, it is clear that something happened when he left Manhattan and moved to Brooklyn. When he plunged into deep solitude, he found something new. There were the muted tones of the Bowery years, the simple triangles, and then suddenly, an explosion of color, mesmerizing patterns. After the initial burst, the paintings grew more austere. There was more negative space and the colors grew a bit fainter with the years, but the palette remained the same. As did his passion for geometry: Mr. Bates\u2019s last paintings were huge X\u2019s and chevrons that when examined closely revealed tiny grids of dabbed paint. Mrs. Bates said she did not believe that her husband regretted his decision to work in obscurity. His goal had been not to pander to passing tastes, or to scatter his work to the four winds. He had just painted. Mr. Bates was looking for some way to exhibit his work at the end of his life, she said. But as he approached death, he took solace in the thought that if his work were ever discovered, his oeuvre would be nearly complete. Asked if she had grown frustrated by his obstinacy, Mrs. Bates paused, then said, \u201cYou know, in time I came to understand.\u201d She added, \u201cHe was hardheaded and I think you had to be that way, not to get your head turned around.\u201dJack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "BlackRock\u2019s Chief, Laurence Fink, Urges Other C.E.O.s to Stop Being So Nice to Investors", "Date": "2015-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookOn Tuesday morning, the chief executives of 500 of the nation\u2019s largest companies will receive a letter in the mail that will most likely surprise them.The sender of the letter is Laurence D. Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world. Mr. Fink oversees more than $4 trillion \u2014 that\u2019s trillion with a \u201ct\u201d \u2014 of investments, making him perhaps the world\u2019s most important shareholder.He is planning to tell the leaders that too many of them have been trying to return money to investors through so-called shareholder-friendly steps like paying dividends and buying back stock.To Mr. Fink, these maneuvers, often done under pressure from activist investors, are harming the long-term creation of value and may be doing companies and their investors a disservice, despite the increases in stock prices that have often been the result.\u201cThe effects of the short-termist phenomenon are troubling both to those seeking to save for long-term goals such as retirement and for our broader economy,\u201d Mr. Fink writes in the letter. He says that such moves were being done at the expense of investing in \u201cinnovation, skilled work forces or essential capital expenditures necessary to sustain long-term growth.\u201d At a time when most investors are clamoring \u2014 and applauding \u2014 high dividends and bigger buybacks, Mr. Fink is bucking the trend.Rather than consider the return of all this money to shareholders positively, Mr. Fink says the move \u201csends a discouraging message about a company\u2019s ability to use its resources wisely and develop a coherent plan to create value over the long term.\u201d Moreover, he argues that \u201cwith interest rates approaching zero, returning excessive amounts of capital to investors\u201d isn\u2019t helpful because they \u201cwill enjoy comparatively meager benefits from it in this environment.\u201dMr. Fink and I have been discussing \u2014 and debating \u2014 this topic for more than a year. Last week, before mailing his letter, which he writes annually, he shared it with me.\u201cI feel the same pressures as other C.E.O.s,\u201d he told me. But he suggested that it\u2019s not just the fault of managements for being so shortsighted \u2014 the investors themselves may be the problem. \u201cInvestors need to focus on long-term strategies and long-term outcomes,\u201d Mr. Fink said, suggesting we\u2019re currently living in a \u201cgambling society.\u201dMr. Fink has a novel suggestion for encouraging shareholders to take a broader perspective, but it may very well upset his peers on Wall Street. He recommends that gains on investments held for less than three years be taxed as ordinary income, not at the usually lower long-term capital gains rate, which now applies after one year. \u201cWe believe that U.S. tax policy, as it stands, incentivizes short-term behavior,\u201d he writes in his letter. \u201cSince when was one year considered a long-term investment? A more effective structure would be to grant long-term treatment only after three years, and then to decrease the tax rate for each year of ownership beyond that, potentially dropping to zero after 10 years.\u201dMr. Fink contends that such a shift in tax policy \u201cwould create a profound incentive for more long-term holdings and could be designed to be revenue neutral. In short, tax reform that promotes long-term investment will benefit both the companies who rely on capital markets and the hundreds of millions of people saving for retirement.\u201dAsked whether such a change in tax policy would reduce liquidity in the market, Mr. Fink scoffed: \u201cI don\u2019t think Warren Buffett cares about liquidity that much.\u201dIt is refreshing to see a finance executive talk some sense on these issues.However, Mr. Fink is not simply being altruistic. To some degree, he is talking his own book: BlackRock\u2019s business model, unlike those of so many finance companies that rely on trading fees, does not require it to turn over its portfolio. Given its size and scale, BlackRock often holds its investments for decades. So from a financial perspective, Mr. Fink has little to lose. In fact, the firm may have much to gain if tax rules were adjusted to be more favorable to the way Mr. Fink invests. (And what\u2019s the harm in suggesting tax policy change, as smart as it may be, that has a low probability of ever happening?)That\u2019s not to suggest Mr. Fink doesn\u2019t believe what he\u2019s saying; he does. He is a relatively progressive finance executive who has been a longtime Democrat and has taken positions that many of his peers in finance abhor.To Mr. Fink, the shortsightedness that pervades corporate America is just a symptom of a larger issue. \u201cThis is not just a corporate problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a societal problem, whether it\u2019s health care or politics or business.\u201dHe also said he recognized that his letter might not be popular in certain quarters but he qualified his approach by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make friends or enemies.\u201dDespite his protestations, Mr. Fink said, \u201cThere is nothing inherently wrong with returning capital to shareholders in a measured fashion.\u201d He added, \u201cNor are the demands of activists necessarily at odds with the interests of other shareholders.\u201d But it\u2019s when it is taken to extremes \u2014 such as it seems to be in the current marketplace \u2014 that has Mr. Fink concerned.Still, Mr. Fink is taking a direct shot at the rise of activist investors, like Carl C. Icahn, who have made careers out of pressing companies to return cash to shareholders.Mr. Fink said he met with two activists last week. One of them, he said, told him, \u201cYou hate me, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t hate you,\u201d Mr. Fink said he replied. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get some balance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Limits of Outsmarting a Strong Dollar", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you buy foreign stocks, you get stakes in foreign companies and also the currencies they do business in. If you have been invested abroad over the last year or so, there is a good chance that you have been happy with the first part. But the currency exposure? Probably not.The dollar rose 9 percent against a standard basket of currencies in the four quarters through March, leaving it close to a 12-year high and curtailing or even eliminating the gains on foreign stocks when expressed in dollars.You can limit susceptibility to currency fluctuations by choosing certain managers or types of funds, but you may not want to. Because big moves tend to be reversed over time, investment advisers say the best way to handle currencies in a long-term portfolio is to all but ignore them.\u201cIf you\u2019re buying a fund for the long haul, currency should sort itself out back to neutral because currencies ebb and flow,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, director of fund research at S&P Capital IQ. \u201cYou should be cognizant of currency movements, but I don\u2019t think they should be a major factor when choosing an international fund.\u201dBut the rally in the dollar has persuaded many investors to buy hedged E.T.F.s \u2014 exchange-traded funds that use derivative instruments to nullify the impact of currency movements. Assets in these funds, which are offered by WisdomTree Investments, BlackRock\u2019s iShares and Deutsche Bank\u2019s X-Trackers, more than tripled in the 12 months through March, to $47 billion, according to Morningstar, mainly through new investment. Assets in all international stock E.T.F.s rose 26 percent during that span.\u201cThere have been heavy flows into those products, and they have significantly outperformed their actively managed peers because most funds that invest abroad don\u2019t hedge their currency exposure,\u201d said Patricia Oey, an analyst at Morningstar who specializes in E.T.F.s.The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Japan E.T.F., for example, rose 16.4 percent in the four quarters through March, compared with 12 percent for Japan mutual funds and 10.6 percent for the unhedged iShares Japan E.T.F. The outperformance was sizable for hedged Europe E.T.F.s, too.Over longer periods, hedged and unhedged E.T.F.s have performed roughly the same, Ms. Oey said, but the hedging process adds to a fund\u2019s costs, putting a drag on returns for buy-and-hold investors, so she considers hedged E.T.F.s better as trading vehicles. Even then, they may not be suitable for many investors.\u201cThey\u2019re good for a short-term trade, but it\u2019s probably more trouble than it\u2019s worth,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could have a lot of taxable capital gains, and there are commissions, and you might get it wrong\u201d and buy at a bad time.Jeremy Schwartz, director of research at WisdomTree, thinks that hedged E.T.F.s make useful long-term holdings. He called the widespread belief that they do not \u201cthe biggest misconception there is when people address this topic.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no model that says currencies produce an expected positive return,\u201d he said, looking at the long-term impact, or lack of it, from a different angle. \u201cSo what is the point of taking currency risk?\u201dThe point to Ms. Oey is that some markets, including ones like Japan for which hedged E.T.F.s have been popular, feature an inverse correlation between stocks and currency values. By eliminating currency risk, investors may be increasing risk over all, she said, although she noted that the inverse relationship between currencies and stocks does not apply to all markets.With global stocks performing well and the dollar strong, owners of hedged E.T.F.s are having their cake and eating it, too. But what happens when feast gives way to famine and the dollar starts giving up its gains? That\u2019s when manager discretion can come in handy.\u201cThe good thing about actively managed mutual funds is that they can always take a hedge off, but a hedged product is always hedged,\u201d Mr. Rosenbluth said. Referring to the dollar\u2019s strength, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t have the expertise to tell you when that stops, but at some point international currencies should do well.\u201dBut most fund managers readily concede that they do not have the expertise, either, so they do not make currency calls or hedge their exposure. They would rather look for solid companies to invest in based on the usual criteria \u2014 growth prospects, valuation, financial and managerial strength \u2014 and consider the currency backdrop only to the extent that it influences those factors.\u201cAs a general rule we do not hedge,\u201d said Jamie Doyle, co-manager of the Causeway International Value fund. One reason, he said, is that \u201cit\u2019s often difficult to know what the underlying hedge should be.\u201dIt would be easy enough to figure out with one of his holdings, KDDI, a Japanese mobile phone service provider whose sales are almost entirely in yen, he noted, but another one, Toyota, has costs and sales all over the world. Toyota itself hedges, Mr. Doyle added, and is long the dollar, so anyone who hedged a position in Toyota could be more exposed to the dollar than an investor who owned the same stake in an American company.Bryan Lloyd, co-manager of the Harding Loevner International Equity fund, doesn\u2019t hedge, either. Even so, he makes it a point to ensure that companies he is contemplating buying have a rough balance between the currencies of their sales and costs.\u201cWe spend a fair amount of time analyzing what exposures businesses might have,\u201d Mr. Lloyd said. \u201cIf we find a material mismatch that may affect a company\u2019s financial strength, we won\u2019t own it.\u201d He is especially wary of banks for which the currencies of its loans and deposits are out of whack.Nick Kaiser, manager of the Sextant International Fund, finds that currency effects balance out in other ways. With the euro depressed, the yachts and motorboats that the French company Beneteau makes are more affordable for Americans. But Beneteau\u2019s vessels are just as expensive for anyone paying in euros, he pointed out, and with the euro cheap because Europe\u2019s economy is struggling, seafarers there are less likely to be in the market for one.SOME portfolio managers do hedge. Evermore Global Advisors uses derivatives called forward contracts to eliminate exposure, much as hedged E.T.F.s do. David Marcus, Evermore\u2019s chief executive, acknowledged Mr. Doyle\u2019s concern, that the hedging activity of some companies in a portfolio, combined with the manager\u2019s, could create too much dollar exposure from an individual holding. But any imbalance across a portfolio is unlikely, Mr. Marcus said.\u201cIf you do not hedge, then you are implicitly making a currency call,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to rise or fall based on our ability to find compelling investments,\u201d not because of foreign-exchange movements, he said.That is the logic underpinning hedged E.T.F.s, although they do not use active stock picking to fill their portfolios. Ms. Oey still contends that it is more sensible for someone with a long horizon to invest abroad through more conventional vehicles.\u201cFor long-term investors,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s probably better just to go with a good mutual fund with a good manager or with a cheap, broadly diversified E.T.F.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The stall coincided with signs of flagging momentum in economic growth and corporate earnings and an assortment of foreign developments that threatened to derail the markets.One asset rose substantially, reaching a 12-year high. That was the dollar, which rose 9 percent against a standard basket of currencies of American trading partners. Its ascent was partly driven by a standoff between financially feeble Greece and its European creditors that could force Greece out of the euro. The dollar was also propelled by an event that for years has seemed a few months away: an increase in the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve\u2019s main short-term interest rate. As expected, the Fed last month dropped its pledge to be patient about raising the rate, wording it had used consistently in its policy statements. But the rest of the March statement made clear that the central bank was in no hurry to raise the near-zero percent rate until the economy perks up.The apparent belief among investors that the Fed was still on their side and that economic indicators were not working against them was enough to send the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index up, but barely: It rose less than 0.5 percent in the first quarter, to 2,067.89. Bond prices rose too, reducing the yield on the 10-year Treasury to 1.93 percent from 2.17 percent. Yields on high- and low-quality corporate instruments also fell, although less so. Tacit assurances that no rate increase was imminent have long supported stocks and bonds, but concern is growing that the Fed may have painted itself into a corner. A rate increase could provoke turbulence in the markets, investment advisers warn, but continuing to delay could raise concern about the fragility of the markets, the economic recovery or both. Investors who have cheered the Fed\u2019s dovishness could be the ones whose patience is tested.\u201cThe market believes the Fed doesn\u2019t have the capacity to raise rates, and that\u2019s not a healthy thing,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief United States market strategist at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be at zero, but they don\u2019t want to remove accommodation in a way that\u2019s disruptive.\u201dBut given the Fed\u2019s desire to normalize policy, investors would be better off pondering \u201cwhat the Fed\u2019s pace will be and how far they go,\u201d rather than obsessing over when rates will start rising, Mr. Golub said. He predicted that \u201cwhatever they do, they\u2019re going to do it really, really slowly,\u201d bringing Fed funds to about 1.75 percent by the end of 2017.How successful the Fed has been in dragging the economy out of recession and financial turmoil is debatable. Joblessness has continued to trend lower, at least until a report released early this month showed much fewer net jobs created in March than expected, but wage growth has been sluggish and indicators of the housing market and consumer spending have been weak.Each of the last three Census Bureau monthly reports on retail sales has shown a decline. The pace of home sales reported by the National Association of Realtors for January and February was lower than for any month since last April, as was the average price of previously owned single-family homes.Corporate profits have hit a rough patch, too. Earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 are estimated by FactSet Research Systems to be 4.7 percent lower in the first quarter than the period last year. For all of 2015, FactSet forecasts a 2.3 percent increase, less than half the 4.9 percent gain last year.Fund returns in the first quarter were mediocre, in line with economic and corporate performance. The average domestic stock fund in Morningstar\u2019s database rose 2.6 percent, led by portfolios that focus on health care and consumer discretionary items, the sector that includes retailers, carmakers and travel companies. Funds that hold energy stocks were conspicuously weak, losing 2 percent, as the prices of oil and natural gas continued the plunges that began last June. Browse quarterly returns for variable annuities with at least $6 billion in assets.Energy companies account for much of the decline in earnings estimates. Leaving that sector out, Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citi Research, found economic and corporate conditions satisfactory. Credit is still expanding, he said, manufacturing capacity is tight, and capital spending, excluding energy industries, is expected to rise 5 percent this year.WHETHER the economy is doing well, poorly or so-so, there is a consensus that the United States is faring better than most of the rest of the world. Even so, foreign stock markets and funds that invest in them outperformed. The average international stock fund returned 3.4 percent, with funds that focus on Japan doing exceptionally well, up 12 percent. European funds rose 4.9 percent, while Latin American funds dropped 8.9 percent. Funds that focus on India were notably strong performers, rising 8.4 percent. With many emerging markets facing difficulties, including high debt, weak currencies and slow global growth, India is \u201cone shiny standout,\u201d said Elizabeth R. Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants. She credits success there, which she predicts will continue, to a package of business-friendly changes made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At the other end of the spectrum is Brazil. Ms. Morrissey described its fortunes as \u201cway scarier than others\u201d because of the strong dollar, collapsing commodity prices, high inflation and a corruption scandal at Petrobras, the national oil company.\u201cThe government has been in office three months, and people are already taking to the streets,\u201d she said.The rising dollar has had a more benign effect elsewhere. Investment advisers attribute much of the strength in foreign stocks and the dollar to a single catalyst: diverging monetary policies. The Fed may be taking its time to turn hawkish, but few foreign central banks are even contemplating it and several are going in the opposite direction.The European Central Bank started a program of bond purchases in the first quarter, the Bank of Japan continues to buy bonds, and the People\u2019s Bank of China is expected to do the same soon.These moves have helped make many foreign stocks more appealing. The most recent edition of Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s survey of global fund managers, released in mid-March, found managers with the greatest underweight position in American stocks, versus the rest of the world, since early 2008.A Fed that is more hawkish than other central banks bolsters the dollar by keeping yields comparatively high on American bonds, enticing foreigners to buy them and, therefore, the dollar. But yields just about everywhere are historically low, perhaps perilously so, and prices are very high, said Joel Beam, manager of the Forward Select Opportunity fund. \u201cI\u2019m extremely carefully positioned and selling into strength anything that seems overpriced,\u201d he said.Bond investors escaped the first quarter mostly unscathed. The average fund was up 1.3 percent, with portfolios that specialize in long-term issues rising 3.2 percent. Two categories of funds that hold foreign bonds \u2014 world bond and emerging-market bond \u2014 were barely changed. Mr. Beam prefers stocks, with reservations. \u201cThe stock landscape is pretty expensive, but people have to be thinking about having more equities in their life for the next five years,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than buy fixed income and get slaughtered, buy a good bank.\u201dAs for where to seek such a bank or other stock, he suggests Europe, which he considers to be in the early stages of a \u201crobust healing process.\u201dIf Europe is on the mend, investment advisers credit the European Central Bank. Ms. Morrissey believes that the bond purchase program, or quantitative easing, has immunized other weak eurozone economies from danger should Greece leave the currency bloc.\u201cMr. Draghi saved the day,\u201d she said, referring to Mario Draghi, the head of the bank. \u201cI would expect\u201d the prospect of a Greek exit \u201cto have an impact on Italy, but with Q.E. it hasn\u2019t. The rest of the union will probably hold together.\u201dAs for Greece itself, Ms. Morrissey rates the odds slightly better than even that it will remain in the euro. It is uncertain whether \u201cthey have the cash to survive,\u201d she acknowledged, \u201cbut it seems the new Greek government really understands the severity of their situation.\u201dEffusive praise for European policy makers is one reason Mr. Levkovich, the Citi Research equity strategist, prefers American stocks.\u201cEveryone loves Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat tells me they\u2019ve bought it already.\u201dJudging by the tripling of the S.&P. 500 in six years, a lot of investors have bought American stocks, too. He predicted further gains, but only about 7 percent this year. He recommended niches like retailing, financial services and parts of technology like infrastructure and security, and he said he would avoid health care and the bond market.Mr. Golub, of RBC Capital Markets, also favored American stocks, and was cautious in his optimism. \u201cThe weight of evidence suggests the next six to 12 months look pretty safe,\u201d he said.He warned that it was hard to know how to invest when investors and the Fed itself would prefer a reversion to normal monetary policy but are afraid of the first rate increase that would signal its arrival.\u201cWe\u2019re in a bizarro land,\u201d Mr. Golub said. \u201cThe way investors are thinking is abnormal, but it\u2019s logical.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Cracks Down on Golf, the \u2018Sport for Millionaires\u2019", "Date": "2015-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe provincial anticorruption agency has set up a hotline for reporting civil servants who violate nine specific regulations, including prohibitions on betting on golf, playing with people connected to one\u2019s job, traveling on golf-related junkets or holding positions on the boards of golf clubs.\u201cThis is Xi Jinping\u2019s China, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s intent on making his mark,\u201d Mr. Washburn said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a potential target in this ongoing crackdown on corruption, and golf is a particularly easy and obvious one.\u201dGolf has faced harsh suppression in China before. When the Communist Party came to power in 1949, Mao Zedong condemned the game as a \u201csport for millionaires,\u201d and courses that had been built for foreigners were turned into public parks, zoos and communal farms.The sport went dormant for three decades before China\u2019s first course since the revolution opened in Guangdong in 1984. Now, as many as one million people play the game in China. Though it is popular among members of the wealthy elite \u2014 including party bureaucrats, apparently \u2014 some of China\u2019s earliest professional golfers are former workers and farmers who stumbled onto the game.Huang Wenyi, a onetime construction worker who is now the world\u2019s 1,189th-ranked player, thrilled Chinese fans Thursday after he led at the end of the first day of the Shenzhen International, a European Tour-sanctioned event in the southern Chinese city. (He had fallen to 13th place by the end of play Saturday.)Chinese players in their teens and even younger, drilled by parents and coaches with a resolution that rivals that of state-run sports schools, are expected to be strongly represented among the world\u2019s top players in coming decades.The national government banned the construction of new courses in 2004, citing concern over the environmental impact of unrestrained development. But even that did not stop the game\u2019s rise. In defiance of the ban, the number of courses in China has grown more than threefold since then, to more than 600 today, according to industry estimates.Courses were often built as part of luxury housing developments to increase land values and attract rich property investors. Local governments, which depend on land sales for a large share of their revenues, looked the other way as developers described them as \u201cleisure\u201d facilities.\u201cGolf, because of its high cost and unique glamour, has been called the \u2018aristocrats\u2019 game,\u2019 \u201d the newspaper said. \u201cBut an awkward truth is that because of \u2018rotten\u2019 golf, some officials have been punished or even jailed.\u201dAn art dealer in Beijing, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss illicit activity, said that many insider deals were made over rounds of golf. \u201cWhen we play golf, we invite officials, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not something ordinary people can afford.\u201dSome golfers have complained about the criticism of their sport, arguing that there is nothing inherently corrupt about it. \u201cAround the world so many officials and even presidents play golf. Why is it that in one certain country that when an official plays golf, he\u2019s corrupt?\u201d Lin Xiang, a golf coach in Shanghai, wrote on Sina Weibo, the popular social media platform.Uncertainty about the future of the sport has led to a drastic slowdown in course construction. \u201cIt\u2019s all drying up,\u201d said Les Watts, a Hong Kong-based course designer. After two decades of work on courses in mainland China, he says he is planning to soon return to his native Australia.Still, Chinese golfers are not ready to abandon their new passion. \u201cI\u2019m still playing,\u201d said a 60-year-old golfer in Beijing who would only give his surname, Zhang. \u201cIt\u2019s already in the next Olympic Games, so the state will definitely support it.\u201dMr. Zhang sat with his shoes off, checking stocks on a small computer before a round at his club. \u201cIf ordinary people use our own money to play,\u201d he said, \u201cthe government never says you can\u2019t do it.\u201dMr. Washburn, the author, said golf would continue to be buffeted by the contradictions of a country that has embraced market forces even as it continues to describe itself as socialist.\u201cThere are alternate realities in China,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll read headlines about a war on golf, and the next you\u2019ll hear about China\u2019s future Olympic golf stars.\u201dVanessa Piao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

That was the pronoun he said he preferred in his appearance last week on national television in which he disclosed that he was becoming a woman.Still, it can be tricky to be both respectful and grammatically accurate when writing about gender transitions and gender nonconformity.Some people identify as male or female. Others reject both labels or say they\u2019re in transition. But traditional English usage has only \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe.\u201d Not a lot of nuance there.That could change.

{"Headline": "Wang Jianlin, a Billionaire at the Intersection of Business and Power in China", "Date": "2015-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 He controls thousands of movie screens around the world, serving more filmgoers than any other cinema chain. He has invested billions of dollars in real estate projects across four continents. He is building skyscrapers that will redraw the skylines of London and Chicago. He is shopping for a Hollywood studio.As his real estate and entertainment empire expands overseas, Mr. Wang, 60, has emerged as the rare private-sector tycoon in a position to advance Beijing\u2019s interests abroad, with clout in industries and communities around the world.How the son of a foot soldier in Mao Zedong\u2019s Communist Revolution catapulted into the top tier of the global elite is an archetypal story of China\u2019s transition to capitalism and the outsize opportunities it presents those with talent or connections \u2014 or, in Mr. Wang\u2019s case, both. His story, though, is also singular: He built one of the world\u2019s most valuable real estate portfolios in a nation where the state retains ownership of all land.A yearlong examination of his success by The New York Times casts a light on the murky intersection of business and power at the heights of the Chinese economy, where market competition is often warped by the whims of Communist Party leaders.Entrepreneurs have powered rapid growth in China for more than three decades. But even the most successful businessmen here must still reach some accommodation with the party, which only a generation ago operated a socialist planned economy.Mr. Wang says he has prospered by delivering what ambitious party officials crave: choice real estate developments that propel economic growth and bolster their careers. In return, he says, the officials sell him the rights to develop choice parcels of land at prices far below what his competitors pay.His conglomerate, Wanda Group, is best known in China for its signature Wanda Plazas, massive shopping complexes with cinemas, office towers, hotels and apartments. Since building the first one in the northeastern city of Changchun in 2002, he has opened more than 100 of them in at least 70 other Chinese cities, generating the revenue that now finances his ambitions abroad.But there is an aspect of his relationship with the authorities that Mr. Wang never raises in interviews and that has gone unreported in the many accounts of his success published in China and abroad: Relatives of some of the nation\u2019s most powerful politicians and their business associates own significant stakes in his company.An extensive review of corporate records filed with the government identified several such investments made from 2007 to 2011, when Wanda was privately held and rarely sold shares to outsiders.Other early investors included a business partner of the daughter of former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, and relatives of two other members of the ruling Politburo at the time, Jia Qinglin and Wang Zhaoguo, according to the records and interviews with family members and business associates.There is no indication that any of the politicians whose relatives and business associates owned shares in Wanda intervened on the company\u2019s behalf in any of its dealings with the government. Nor is there evidence that any of the politicians personally benefited from the windfall that these investors reaped. The investors and officials did not respond to written questions or could not be reached for comment.Mr. Wang declined an interview request and did not respond to written questions submitted to Wanda. But in public remarks, he often uses the same phrase to describe how he manages his relationship with the authorities: \u201cStay close to the government and distant from politics.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that China\u2019s economy is government-led, and the real estate industry depends on approvals, so if you say you can ignore the government in this business, I\u2019d say that\u2019s impossible,\u201d Mr. Wang told state television in a February interview. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s hypocritical and fake to say that. ... But at the same time, for example, we don\u2019t pay bribes.\u201dA Remarkable Winning StreakIt was September 2012, and students at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard were spellbound by an unusual lecturer, a short, plain-talking man with close-set eyes and a prominent widow\u2019s peak.It would not have been a particularly incisive observation from a member of the faculty. But the speaker that afternoon was Mr. Wang, and despite the hardships that he described, he was on a remarkable winning streak.Months earlier, Mr. Wang had purchased AMC Entertainment Holdings, the second-largest theater chain in the United States. By year\u2019s end, his empire in China would include 66 Wanda Plazas, 38 five-star hotels, 980 cinema screens and 57 department stores, not to mention 63 karaoke saloons. Within a year, he would break ground on an $8 billion movie studio and theme park in the coastal city of Qingdao, flying in stars such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Nicole Kidman and John Travolta to celebrate.With success came the familiar trappings of the megarich. Mr. Wang bought a Picasso painting at auction for $28.2 million. His wife socialized with Prince Albert of Monaco. His son hired a top Korean pop group to perform at his 27th birthday party.Not content with just owning a yacht, Mr. Wang bought the British company that makes the luxury boats seen in James Bond films. In January, his company announced it was buying a stake in a Spanish soccer club.\u201cHe is a force of nature,\u201d said Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chief executive of DreamWorks Animation, who has known Mr. Wang for three years. \u201cHe is a very, very strong personality, and he is extremely confident about what he is doing.\u201dMr. Wang\u2019s father was a veteran of the Communist Party\u2019s Long March, the arduous and deadly trek across China in the 1930s by the Communists that hardened a generation of revolutionaries, and Mr. Wang himself, the eldest of five brothers, followed him into the army as a teenager. In a 2013 appearance on state television, he recalled marching hundreds of miles through knee-deep snow in training exercises during Mao\u2019s fanatical Cultural Revolution.\u201cMany people couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d Mr. Wang said, but he did. He then spent the next 16 years rising through the officer ranks, an experience that colleagues say informs his management style. Even his most senior Wanda executives are required to punch in and out, for example, and tardiness is not tolerated, former employees say.After leaving the military, Mr. Wang took a government job in the northeastern port city of Dalian. His big break there came in 1988, when he was transferred to a failing state-owned builder of residential apartment blocks. By his own account, he secured a loan with the help of an old army buddy and returned the company to profitability.In 1992, the firm was restructured as one of China\u2019s first shareholding companies, and over the next decade, Mr. Wang oversaw its privatization, emerging as its majority owner.The mayor of Dalian for much of that time was Bo Xilai, a politician who was the son of an influential party elder and who would rise to the Politburo before falling from power in a stunning corruption and murder scandal in 2012.Mr. Wang was an extraordinary benefactor to Dalian during Mr. Bo\u2019s tenure, buying the city\u2019s soccer team, which helped make it a national champion, and donating tens of millions of dollars to build schools.Since Mr. Bo\u2019s fall, Mr. Wang has sought to distance himself from him. In a recent interview, he said he struggled during those years because he refused to pay bribes and did not get along with Mr. Bo. That limited his access to land, he said, which Mr. Bo\u2019s administration would not sell him.Because the state retains formal ownership of all land in China, those who want to build on it must have the state\u2019s blessing. Local governments have depended for years on the sale of long-term rights to develop land to finance their operations. But who gets which parcels, and at what price, is as much a political decision as an economic one.Mr. Wang says his company is so good at delivering benefits to the cities where it builds that local governments now compete for his business and he turns down more than two out of every three proposals.\u201cWe thus can take the initiative, and we have the bargaining power,\u201d he told the students at Harvard. That means he acquires land at less than half the cost to his competitors, he added.Even as property prices set records in China, the price that Dalian Wanda paid for access to land fell by more than 40 percent from 2011 to 2014, according to its I.P.O. prospectus.Wang Yongping, vice chairman of the China Commercial Real Estate Association, said local officials were eager to work with Wanda because of the tax revenue its projects bring them and because it has a reputation for getting things done fast. The company can finish a Wanda Plaza at what it calls Wanda Speed, or within 18 months.\u201cChinese government officials love to have achievements when they are in office,\u201d Wang Yongping said. \u201cEighteen months might determine whether they can become a district chief or a provincial party secretary.\u201dBut some in power have other reasons to root for Wang Jianlin.A Paper Trail to the EliteIn July 2007, Mr. Wang had built only a handful of Wanda Plazas. He had yet to make his first billion dollars, and few outside China had heard of him or his company. The Hurun Rich List, which tracks the net worth of the wealthiest people in China, ranked him 148th.But late that month, a newly formed firm in Beijing, Minghao Holdings, acquired a 2.5 percent stake in Mr. Wang\u2019s flagship company, Wanda Group, becoming its largest external shareholder, according to corporate records. There was only one other outside shareholder at the time, a local real estate company in Dalian run by a friend.Then, two months later, another newly established firm in Beijing, Wugufeng Investment Consulting, took a 1.53 percent stake in the main company that Mr. Wang used to hold his shares in Wanda Group, becoming its fifth shareholder, the records show.The documents do not indicate why the two Beijing firms were invited to become early investors in Mr. Wang\u2019s business. But the paper trail from the companies leads to relatives of two men sitting at the time on the Communist Party\u2019s ruling Politburo: Jia Qinglin, a longtime party boss of the Beijing municipality who ranked fourth in the party leadership, and Wang Zhaoguo, a senior legislator who was the leading force behind a landmark law providing legal protections for private property.Wang Zhaoguo\u2019s son, Wang Xinyu, was the controlling shareholder of the first firm, which later transferred its stake in Wanda to a young woman named Yang Xin, the records show. Ms. Yang is the Politburo member\u2019s niece, according to Wang Zhao\u2019an, a cousin who serves as party chief in the family\u2019s home village in Hebei Province.The owner of the second firm is listed in the records as Pan Yongbin, 63, who shares a business address, staff and phone numbers with a Beijing investment firm run by Mr. Jia\u2019s son-in-law, Li Botan. Mr. Pan is also listed as a board member of several firms owned by Mr. Li, including his main investment company.As Wanda prospered in the years that followed, the value of these early stakes skyrocketed.The firm controlled by Wang Zhaoguo\u2019s son paid less than $500,000 for its stake, according to Wanda\u2019s filings with the government, though the firm\u2019s own records do not show the transaction. The documents are more complete for the second firm, showing a payment of less than $200,000 for its stake. Those two stakes are now worth more than $640 million and $250 million.Neither Politburo member was in a position to directly set the price or approve the sale of land-use rights to Wanda. But party institutions under the two men have showered Wang Jianlin with public recognition.In March 2008, Mr. Wang was one of only three mainland billionaires named to the standing committee of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Congress, a national advisory body, led by Mr. Jia, that is made up of people whom the party leadership deems influential. The appointment amounted to a seal of approval by top party leaders, said one Chinese businessman who serves on a similar body and spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his position.In June 2007, Mr. Wang was also named an outstanding private entrepreneur by a party-run industry association, the first of five awards bestowed upon him over the next four years from groups led by or associated with Wang Zhaoguo.Honors like these can signal to local officials and potential business partners that their recipients are well connected. \u201cAt least within China, people will be much more willing to do business with you, and much less likely to offend you,\u201d said Victor Shih, a scholar at the University of California, San Diego.After the global financial crisis in late 2008, China\u2019s property market took a nose dive. Real estate stocks in Shanghai ended the year down 65 percent.But Wanda had a banner year, breaking ground on seven new Wanda Plaza complexes \u2014 setting a record \u2014 and propelling Wang Jianlin to 20th on the Hurun list of China\u2019s richest people, with a fortune estimated at $2.3 billion.The next year, Wanda distributed shares to outsiders again, privately selling an 8.5 percent stake in the company.Among the eight new investors was a Beijing firm owned through a network of holding companies by Qi Qiaoqiao, the sister of Xi Jinping, and her husband, Deng Jiagui.Ms. Qi and Mr. Xi are members of a privileged elite consisting of the offspring of senior party officials. Their now deceased father, Xi Zhongxun, was a military comrade of Mao and later became a vice premier and a pioneer of economic reform.Ms. Qi worked in a variety of political and military posts during her career before becoming a businesswoman. During that time, her younger brother, Mr. Xi, was working his way up through the ranks in provincial government posts.It is not known why Ms. Qi and her husband were offered the chance to invest in Wanda. By 2009, she was already a wealthy investor with business relationships across the country. Meanwhile, her brother had become China\u2019s vice president and was the consensus candidate to become the party\u2019s next leader.In many cases, the couple sold their investments to individuals with no clear connection to them.But the shares in Wanda \u2014 valued at $240 million now, up from the $28.6 million the couple paid for them in 2009 \u2014 were transferred to a longtime business associate on Oct. 8, 2013. The records give no indication of the price paid by the business associate, who has served the couple in various corporate posts for more than a decade.Another new shareholder in Wanda was an investment fund owned in part and managed by a subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings, the investment arm of Beijing\u2019s prestigious Tsinghua University. At the time, the top official at Tsinghua Holdings was Hu Haifeng, the son of Hu Jintao, then China\u2019s president. There is no indication Hu Haifeng personally benefited from or held any shares in Wanda himself.Some of the individuals given an early chance to invest in Wanda are difficult to identify. One of them, Jin Yi, acquired a stake in 2009 that is now worth about $250 million. But the address on her identity card is incomplete, and her name is not included on the official registry of residents in the neighborhood listed.Promoting Chinese Culture\u201cThis is a discussion on economics today and shouldn\u2019t delve into politics,\u201d Mr. Wang snapped. \u201cYou are publicly saying bad things about China \u2014 at the very least, I don\u2019t think this is very polite.\u201dAs his fortune has climbed and his investments have stretched overseas, Mr. Wang has emerged as an outspoken advocate for his homeland. In interviews and speeches, he tends to present himself as the pragmatic face of big business in China, delivering a soothing message of opportunity to foreign audiences anxious about the country\u2019s rise.\u201cWang Jianlin is a perfect instrument for that from the party\u2019s point of view,\u201d said Joseph Nye, the Harvard professor who coined the term \u201csoft power\u201d and was the panelist scolded by Mr. Wang at Davos.Mr. Wang is effective in part because he is no longer simply a Chinese real estate developer. As Beijing sought to cool its property sector in recent years, he diversified by shifting investments abroad and into the culture and entertainment sector, including his network of movie theaters, which became the world\u2019s largest in 2012 with the purchase of AMC\u2019s 4,000-plus screens in the United States.The strategy coincided with a policy push by the Chinese leadership to expand the nation\u2019s cultural influence both overseas and at home, where younger generations have increasingly turned to Western music, television and films.A communiqu\u00e9 issued by the party\u2019s Central Committee in October 2011 cited an \u201curgency for China to strengthen its cultural soft power and global cultural influence.\u201d\u201cAfter this document, Wanda started to put a lot of effort into developing the cultural industry,\u201d said Zhang Lihua, a scholar at the Tsinghua-Carnegie Center for Global Policy in Beijing.Investors connected to senior party leaders were able to get in early on Wanda\u2019s move. In December 2010, the investment firm of Mr. Jia\u2019s son-in-law acquired a $9 million stake in Wanda\u2019s cinema subsidiary, records show. As of Monday, the stake was worth $131 million.The Central Committee\u2019s decision resulted in new policies that benefited real estate companies such as Wanda.Local governments, for example, were told to prioritize the sale of land-use rights to companies that built projects that promote Chinese culture. And state-owned banks were told to offer loans for cultural undertakings at home and abroad. The state export-import bank agreed to help finance Wanda\u2019s overseas investments, backing its acquisition of AMC.\u201cNo matter how good Disney is, it is still American culture,\u201d he said after the groundbreaking ceremony last year. \u201cWe hope to use Chinese culture.\u201dXu Han, a scholar at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied the company, said Wanda\u2019s overseas expansion was driven in part by Beijing\u2019s desire to see the nation\u2019s premier companies build a presence abroad. But he said the firm was more interested in profit than in directly influencing public opinion about China.\u201cThe central government\u2019s objective is very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have a very successful Chinese company is good for China.\u201dWhen Mr. Wang bought AMC, he retained the American management team and emphasized that his company would not dictate what films were shown in American theaters.But with China forecast to surpass North America in box office revenue by 2018, Hollywood is already focused on serving Chinese filmgoers and satisfying the censors who determine what foreign films can be shown in Chinese theaters.Mr. Wang often notes that the Chinese market will be twice the size of the North American market by 2023.Foreigners need to heed this new reality, he warned when he hosted Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Kidman for the 2013 groundbreaking of his Qingdao studio.\u201cThose in the world film industry who realize this first and are among the first to cooperate with China,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be the first to reap the benefits.\u201dJonathan Ansfield contributed reporting from Beijing and Shigezhuang, Hebei.

{"Headline": "Apple Won\u2019t Always Rule. Just Look at IBM.", "Date": "2015-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesApple can\u2019t grow like this forever. No company can.In a few short years, Apple has become the biggest company on the planet by market value \u2014 so big that it dwarfs every other one on the stock market. It dominates the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index as no other company has in 30 years. Apple\u2019s market capitalization \u2014 the value of all of the shares of its stock \u2014 is more than $758 billion, greater than any other company\u2019s. Yet the Wall Street consensus is that Apple is still having a growth spurt. In fact, if Apple\u2019s watches, phones, laptops and other gadgets and services keep generating favorable publicity \u2014 and if its quarterly earnings report on Monday is as strong as the market expects it to be \u2014 there\u2019s a reasonable chance that Apple\u2019s value will keep swelling. Not far down the road, it might even reach the $1 trillion level that some hedge funds predict.But even if Apple still has some room to run, there are some early warning signs. After all, the company has already crossed a significant threshold. In February, it grew to twice the size of the next biggest company in the S.&P. 500, a rare feat of financial dominance, and one that hasn\u2019t happened since Ronald Reagan was president.I checked the numbers with Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. He found that the last market colossus to tower over its competitors by a two-to-one ratio was IBM, which did it in three successive years: 1983, 1984 and 1985. \u201cThat was when PCs were new,\u201d he said, \u201cand just about everyone thought IBM would rule the world.\u201d Now it\u2019s Apple\u2019s world. Apple is the most widely held stock in American mutual fund portfolios. IBM, the former undisputed heavyweight champion, isn\u2019t even in the running anymore. It ranks 62nd, according to a Morningstar analysis performed at my request. IBM is still an important company, but it is struggling. Investors judge it to be worth less than one-quarter of Apple\u2019s market value today. What happened to IBM \u2014 how it became this small, in comparison with Apple \u2014 is worth remembering.I had forgotten how imposing IBM once was. By some measures, it was vastly more important than Apple is today. Measured by market cap, for example, IBM accounted for a staggering 6.4 percent of the S.&.P. 500 in 1985, IBM\u2019s peak year \u2014 making it 2.35 times the size of the second-biggest company of its day, Exxon. Now Microsoft is the second biggest and Exxon Mobil is third, both roughly one-half the size of Apple. Exxon Mobil is followed in market cap by Google and Johnson & Johnson. (On this 45th anniversary year of Earth Day, the staying power of Exxon, from its Standard Oil days to the present, is also worth remembering.)Apple has an outsize influence today: After the market close on Friday, its share of the S.&.P. 500 was 4.1 percent, a formidable percentage and a huge increase from Dec. 31, when it was 3.35 percent. But its weight in the market is nothing like IBM\u2019s in the 1980s, when IBM finished seven calendar years with a market weight above 4 percent \u2014 a showing that Apple has not yet met, the data shows. At IBM\u2019s 1985 peak, its share of the S.&P. 500 was more than one and half times the size of Apple\u2019s today.Apple\u2019s market value is now roughly twice the size of the next biggest company\u2019s in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.For the most part, investors minimized those problems, if they were even aware of them. In those days of hulking mainframes, IBM was the quintessential computer company and its hegemony in the stock market seemed unstoppable. Rapid growth, after all, isn\u2019t a sure thing, especially when you\u2019re already the biggest company in the world. IBM has proved that. Sooner or later, Apple investors will have to take that lesson to heart.Advertisement"}
