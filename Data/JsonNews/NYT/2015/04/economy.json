{"Headline": "Burdened With Debt, Law School Graduates Struggle in Job Market", "Date": "2015-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJonathan Wang has not practiced law since he graduated from Columbia Law School in 2010, but he did not plan it that way.When he entered law school, the economy was flourishing, and he had every reason to think that with a prestigious degree he was headed for a secure well-paying career. He convinced his parents, who work in Silicon Valley, that he had a plan. \u201cI would spend three years at school in New York, then work for a big law firm and make $160,000 a year,\u201d said Mr. Wang, 29. \u201cAnd someday, I would become a partner and live the good life.\u201dMr. Wang, who works in Manhattan as a tutor for the law school admissions exam, is living a life far different from the one he envisioned. And he is not alone. About 20 percent of law graduates from 2010 are working at jobs that do not require a law license, according to a new study, and only 40 percent are working in law firms, compared with 60 percent from the class a decade earlier. To pay the bills, the 2010 graduates have taken on a variety of jobs, some that do not require admission to the bar; others have struck out on their own with solo practices. Most of the graduates have substantial student debt.Even as law school enrollment was peaking in 2010 \u2014 reaching 52,488, according to American Bar Association figures \u2014 those graduating were not receiving job offers from firms where they were interning. And offers to some students were rescinded.\u201cNone of this was on my radar,\u201d Mr. Wang said, \u201cbut it began to be obvious by the time second-year summer internships were over. We knew things were depressed, but then the legs were cut out from under us.\u201dAfter the economic collapse in the fall of 2008, corporations began to cut spending on legal matters, and law firms, in turn, began to reduce their hiring and even laid off employees. The legal profession was undergoing the early wave of turbulence that left graduates in subsequent classes facing a harsher job market that has shown few signs of a robust recovery. But the class of 2010 was the first to experience it full force.At the time, legal scholars predicted that when the economy turned the corner, the new graduates would find jobs. But the checkered job outcomes for the 2010 law graduates could be predicted by their early employment numbers, said Deborah J. Merritt, a law professor at Ohio State University\u2019s Moritz College of Law.Professor Merritt combined public data, including court records and the employment outcomes of more than 1,200 lawyers who received their law degrees in 2010 and then passed the Ohio bar, with information from the National Association of Law Placement recorded for the same class nationally. She concluded that the 2010 class had not recovered in the ensuing years.\u201cEmployment has improved only marginally for the class,\u201d she said, \u201cwith unemployment at 6 percent, many fewer lawyers working at law firms and a leap in the percentage of solo practitioners.\u201cThese outcomes contrast markedly with those from the 2000 graduating class, which was also shadowed by an economic recession but were later able to better their positions,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that type of progress has not occurred for the Class of 2010.\u201dWith law firms cutting back, she said, most available positions \u201cfall within modest-paying categories: solo practice, small firms, government work and business jobs that do not require bar admission.\u201dAnd they might be the lucky ones, according to some 2010 graduates who said they were \u201ctoo ashamed that I have not found a legal job\u201d to allow their names to be mentioned. One law school graduate who said he did not want to draw attention to his lack of permanent employment said he was \u201cdoing rote legal temp work on the side to pay rent.\u201d\u201cI dare not put it on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 because it makes you instantly nonprestigious and unemployable,\u201d he added.Others, like G. Troy Pickett, 44, of Houston, who worked as a bartender in Austin before going back to school with the intent of becoming a big-firm mergers and acquisitions lawyer, opted to set up their own practices.\u201cI began to realize that I had set the bar too high, but I kept thinking that if I could get my foot in the door, I could do it,\u201d he said of his decision to attend South Texas College of Law in Houston.Then he saw that fewer firms were recruiting on campus and job offers were evaporating.\u201cIt was a double whammy. Our class was also competing with third- and fourth-year associates who had been laid off,\u201d he said. He took the Texas bar exam six months early while still in law school to save time and money. The same day he passed, in June 2010, he and a fellow student formed a law practice, which handles family law issues like divorces and child custody.Another 2010 graduate, Hyatt Shirkey, 30, who received his diploma in May 2010 from Ohio State\u2019s law school, moved to Virginia, where he passed the bar the following July, and decided to open his own practice after juggling several jobs.\u201cWhen I started law school, it was still a great era,\u201d he said. \u201cI had some good experiences, including working for a federal judge in Columbus, Ohio. Then, the end of my second year in school, I saw that law firm offers were being pushed back.\u201d\u201cThere was a glut of people in the job market, and the only job I could find did not require a law license,\u201d added Mr. Shirkey, who first ran the paralegal studies program for a private college in Roanoke, Va. He eventually found work at the Roanoke public defender\u2019s office but kept his part-time job at the paralegal program and another as a server at a Cracker Barrel restaurant.Since then, he found a job teaching contract law at a local community college and opened a solo practice in criminal defense to \u201cbuild up my experience and reputation\u201d so he could qualify for an opening in the United States attorney\u2019s office. For now, he receives referrals for cases that the public defender cannot take on, but he said practicing on his own was uncertain financially. And, like more than 80 percent of law school graduates, he has substantial student debt.Many have received financial hardship deferments or, like Mr. Shirkey, who accumulated $328,000 in student debt, including some undergraduate loans, received credits for public interest work. Federal government rules, revised last year, allow student borrowers who work in nonprofit and public sector jobs to have their loans forgiven after 10 years and to pay back their college loans based on their income and expenses.\u201cOtherwise, I would be very, very much in a pickle,\u201d Mr. Shirkey said. \u201cI anticipate that I will wind up working for the government or a nonprofit because I will need the credits to take care of my loan burden.\u201cEvery time I look at the debt amount,\u201d he said, \u201cmy heart beats a little harder.\u201dAfter he graduated, Mr. Wang had a yearlong fellowship with a state court judge, but when that ended in 2011, the \u201cmarket was still awful,\u201d he said. After he was admitted to the New York State bar, he turned to tutoring and law school advising to pay his rent and loans.\u201cI thought the LSAT tutoring gig was going to be a temporary thing, but five years and one bar admission renewal later, here I am,\u201d he said. His business has greatly expanded and he makes over $100 an hour, but that is far below what he would make at a law firm. \u201cI waffle constantly, but I\u2019m still in the mind-set that I need to find a real job,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Troubling Interdependency of Water and Power ", "Date": "2015-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Modesto, Calif., utility records chart an 18 percent rise in farmers\u2019 energy use in 2014 compared with 2013. No evidence shows exactly why this happened, but California\u2019s drought, now in its fourth year, sent many farmers to their wells to pump from hidden aquifers water that normally would be found at ground level.Such measures are a timely illustration of the way water needs power \u2014 not just to move it, but to clean it and even, with desalination, to create it from brine. A large desalination plant being built to provide 7 percent of San Diego\u2019s water will require about 38 megawatts of power, enough for more than 28,000 homes. And it is no coincidence that primary owners of the 2,250-megawatt, coal-fired Navajo generating station near Page, Ariz., are water managers; they need the power to move water.In 2011, Texas suffered its own blistering drought. Kent Saathoff, then a vice president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, warned at the time that without rain in the coming months, \u201cthere could be several thousand megawatts of generators that won\u2019t have sufficient cooling water to operate.\u201d Rain eventually arrived to avert that disruption, but this year the R.W. Miller 403-megawatt plant in Palo Pinto, west of Fort Worth, went off-line because it lacks sufficient cooling water.Coiled throughout the American economy, energy and water are forever linked, an economic version of DNA\u2019s double helix. As populations grow and climate change and droughts take their toll, resource managers and environmental advocates are warning that scarcity of either water or energy could set off shortages and escalating costs for both.\u201cOne of the serious risks is that we accelerate a very damaging negative feedback loop both in protecting the environment and impacts to our economy,\u201d said Vickie Patton, general counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund. She worries that \u201cwe will be using energy and water alike in a fashion that only leads to more serious impacts, greater use and much higher cost.\u201dThe situation was born of assumptions from the last century about the abundance of both power and water, according to the Pacific Institute, a nonprofit research center based in Oakland, Calif. Now those assumptions are in doubt.And even before this drought, the California Energy Commission estimated that just under 20 percent of California\u2019s total electricity in a typical year went to move and treat water and other purposes like heating water for homes or businesses. Nationally, the comparable figure of electricity devoted to water was about 12.6 percent in 2010, according to a report from the University of Texas at Austin.Power\u2019s claim on water is even more striking. The Congressional Research Service reported that in 2005 water for cooling power plants \u201crepresented 44 percent of the water withdrawn nationally.\u201d Of this, 6 percent was consumed; the rest was returned, warmer, to local waterways.Warren Lasher, the director of system planning at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said many of the state\u2019s power plants depend on local resources, like nearby ponds, for cooling water.The severe water shortages in 2011, he said, meant \u201ca lot of plants had to lower the intake structures in their ponds.\u201dFor those concerned that the interdependence of power and water could lead to higher costs and greater scarcity of both, two energy developments in the last five years offer both good news and bad.One is the rise of renewables, which can use nominal amounts of water. With solar power, for example, water is needed mostly to clean solar panels.The other big development is directional mining for shale gas embedded in rock. Fracking, as this is known, has transformed the world\u2019s power landscape. It usually means injecting large amounts of chemically infused water underground at high pressure.Still, the sheer volume of water used is an issue. The United States Geological Survey reported that fracking an individual well could take 1.5 million to 5.7 million gallons of water.With demand for power and water at risk of exceeding supply in places, the new goal is to conserve both.Air-cooling equipment for power plants could replace water-cooling, Mr. Lasher said. But that, too, requires power. He said that financial experts would have to sort out \u201cover the next 20 years, which is going to be more expensive, power or water.\u201dContinuing efforts to rethink the use of the two resources are underway at the University of California, Davis\u2019s Center for Water-Energy Efficiency, which has calculated in a report how water is used for power production in 158 national power systems.An article on April 23 about the interdependency of water and power described incorrectly an estimate of how much energy California devoted to water. Before the state\u2019s current drought, according to the estimate, nearly 20 percent of electricity, not of total energy use, went to moving and treating water and to other purposes like heating water for homes or businesses; the estimate covered more than just moving and treating water. The article also misidentified the source of the calculation. The estimate was by the California Energy Commission, not experts at the University of California, Davis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Quakes Rattle Oklahoma, Fingers Point to Oil and Gas Industry", "Date": "2015-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPRAGUE, Okla. \u2014 Yanked without warning from a deep sleep, Jennifer Lin Cooper, whose family has lived near here for more than a half-century, could think only that the clamor enveloping her house was coming from a helicopter landing on her roof. She was wrong.A 5.0-magnitude earthquake \u2014 the first of three as strong or stronger over several days in November 2011 \u2014 had peeled the brick facade from the $117,000 home she bought the year before. Ms. Cooper, 36, could not get out until her father pried a stuck storm door off the front entrance. Repairs have so far cost $12,000 and forced her to take a second job, at night, to pay the bill.At a packed town hall meeting days later, Ms. Cooper said, state officials called the shocks, including a 5.7 tremor that was Oklahoma\u2019s largest ever, \u201can act of nature, and it was nobody\u2019s fault.\u201dBut in a state where oil and gas are economic pillars, elected leaders have been slow to address the problem. And while regulators have taken some protective measures, they lack the money, work force and legal authority to fully address the threats.More than five years after the quakes began a sharp and steady increase, the strongest action by the Republican governor, Mary Fallin, has been to name a council to exchange information about the tremors. The group meets in secret, and has no mandate to issue recommendations.The State Legislature is not considering any earthquake legislation. But both houses passed bills this year barring local officials from regulating oil and gas wells in their jurisdictions.The governor referred an interview request to Michael Teague, her energy and environment secretary. Mr. Teague said the governor\u2019s earthquake council was helping coordinate the response to the shocks and that underfunded regulators and scientists had benefited from efforts to find new state and federal assistance for their work.\u201cIt\u2019s not working well enough if your house is shaking, absolutely no doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s working very well.\u201dBut others say the political will is missing to confront an earthquake threat tied to Oklahoma\u2019s dominant industry.It is \u201ca dangerous game of Russian roulette,\u201d said Jason Murphey, the Republican state representative from earthquake-ridden Guthrie, in central Oklahoma. \u201cIf a dangerous earthquake happens and causes lots of damage and injuries,\u201d he said, \u201ca cloud will hang over the energy sector for a long time to come.\u201dIf scientists see dangers, many Oklahomans are wary of disrupting an industry so woven into everyday life.The state\u2019s oil and gas wells gush profits to corporate owners, but also royalties to farmers and homeowners, and tax payments to the state and cities. By some accounts the industry supports as many as one in five Oklahoma jobs. It showers Oklahoma universities with millions of dollars in donations and helps make dreams like Oklahoma City\u2019s N.B.A. franchise, reality.\u201cWe always want to be invited to the prom,\u201d said State Representative Cory Williams, a Democrat from Stillwater, the home of Oklahoma State University and one of the state\u2019s most seismically active areas. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve decided that oil and gas is the best prom date we\u2019ll ever get, and we don\u2019t want oil and gas to go away.\u201dThose blessings, however, are not unalloyed.From 2010 to 2013, Oklahoma oil production jumped by two-thirds and gas production rose by more than one-sixth, federal figures show. The amount of wastewater buried annually rose one-fifth, to nearly 1.1 billion barrels. And Oklahoma went from three earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater to 109 \u2014 and to 585 in 2014, and to 750-plus this year, should the current pace continue. In the United States, only Alaska is shaken more.Maps showing a rise in the number of earthquakes.The Corporation Commission lacks explicit authority to regulate earthquake risks. So it is trying to contain the risks posed by roughly 3,200 active wastewater disposal wells using laws written to control water pollution.Last spring, the commission began trying to weed out quake risks by scrutinizing wells near larger quakes for operational problems and permit violations. A few dozen wells made modifications; four shut down. It is now difficult to win approval for new wells near stressed faults, active seismic areas or the epicenters of previous quakes above 4.0 magnitude. Regulators significantly expanded the areas under scrutiny last month. Yet the quakes continue.Privately, some companies are cooperating with regulators and scientists by offering proprietary information about underground faults. Publicly, the industry wants Oklahomans to beware of killing the golden goose. A Surge in Wastewater But nowhere have they approached the number and scope of Oklahoma\u2019s quakes, which have rocked a fifth of the state. One reason, scientists suspect, is that Oklahoma\u2019s main waste disposal site, a bed of porous limestone thousands of feet underground, lies close to the hard, highly stressed rock containing the faults that cause quakes.The salty, sometimes toxic wastewater is a byproduct of extracting oil and gas, whether by hydraulic fracturing of once-unreachable shale deposits, commonly called fracking, or from conventional wells. Most is pumped out of the ground with oil or gas, then returned to the earth in a so-called disposal well, often at a different location.The Corporation Commission faces a complicated task. It can order a shutdown or operational change only one well at a time, and only if a well violates its operating permit or is clearly tied to an earthquake risk.But geologists say the sheer volume of waste being buried in an area with many wells \u2014 and not any single well \u2014 causes most quakes. It often is difficult or impossible to assess blame to a particular well.\u201cWe do have the ability to take certain actions in emergency situations,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut that\u2019s emergencies when they start happening. It doesn\u2019t talk about what happens before the emergencies occur.\u201dThe 2011 quakes that damaged Ms. Cooper\u2019s home in Prague (pronounced \u201cprayg\u201d) illustrate the regulators\u2019 limited reach.Acting on geologists\u2019 suspicions after the first temblor, regulators tested and pored over operations data from three wells \u2014 two small ones and a huge one, called Wilzetta, sunk by the Tulsa-based company New Dominion in 1999. They were seeking some definitive cause of the tremor.They found none. The wells still pump today, even as worried regulators wave off operators who want to sink new ones. Indeed, by December 2013, Wilzetta had nearly doubled its average monthly volume of waste compared with the months before the 2011 shocks.Without convincing evidence that a well poses a seismic threat, one official said, regulators are powerless to order precautions, much less shutdowns. \u201cShut it in? How?\u201d said that official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was barred from discussing specific cases. \u201cShow me the cause. Show me the violation.\u201dHamstrung, regulators now may have pushed their authority to its limits. Beginning last May, the commission began tightening permits for new disposal wells, requiring seismicity tests and requiring shutdowns if quakes occurred nearby.Existing wells were unaffected. But last month the agency required operators of hundreds of wells to prove they were not accidentally pumping wastewater into bedrock, which seismologists say raises earthquake risks.\u201cWe are operating on the assumption that time is of the essence,\u201d a regulatory program manager at the commission, Matt Skinner, said in an interview.Scientists certainly agree.While scientists worry, political leaders have been slow to recognize the threat.First elected in 2010, Governor Fallin appointed the earthquake advisory council last September. \u201cOklahoma has always had seismic activity, but the reality is we are seeing more,\u201d she said then. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we study this issue and have sound science that can inform decisions.\u201dShe allowed only last week that wells accidentally drilled into rock containing faults could \u201cpotentially\u201d set off shocks. Scientists say that is only one factor at play in the quakes.The governor\u2019s 12-member earthquake advisory council, drawn from industry, government, the Legislature and academia, works as an information clearinghouse, said Mr. Teague, her energy and environment secretary and the group\u2019s chairman.\u201cThe whole idea of the group,\u201d he said, \u201cis what are you working on? What are the gaps that you\u2019ve got, and is there somebody else that can fill that gap?\u201dThe most glaring gaps, however, remain mostly unfilled.Last month the state promised a clerk, two technical experts and $50,000 to help regulators assess wells, but a $600 million-plus budget deficit makes significant aid unlikely. The Legislature could grant the commission greater authority, but legislators say that is not an option in a state where regulation is deeply unpopular, and the oil and gas industry holds political and economic sway. Residents File Suit The industry has worked on several fronts to contain concern about the quakes.In October 2013, almost two years after the Prague quakes, Dr. Holland, the state seismologist, issued a news release warning that the earthquake risk in Oklahoma City, about 50 miles west of Prague, had increased. Wastewater disposal wells, he added, may be \u201ca contributing factor.\u201d Two weeks later, he was summoned to the office of the University of Oklahoma\u2019s president, David L. Boren, to meet Harold G. Hamm, the chairman of Continental Resources, one of the state\u2019s biggest oil and gas companies. Mr. Boren sits on Continental\u2019s board, for which he has been paid more than $1.6 million in stock awards and directors\u2019 fees since 2009, according to proxy statements.Dr. Holland said that Mr. Boren assured him his academic freedom as a scientist was unchallenged. Then, Dr. Holland said, Mr. Hamm told him that public discussions of disposal wells \u201care unnerving \u2014 they can dramatically affect the industry.\u201dThen, in February, came a class-action lawsuit against the two companies by Ms. Cooper, whose house in Prague was heavily damaged. Her suit seeks compensation for quake damage not only to her home, but to any homes in nine counties surrounding Prague.That case has yet to be heard. But Ms. Ladra\u2019s suit, now before the State Supreme Court, previews the industry response: The wells operate legally, and regulators should hear complaints against them. Letting juries decide their culpability in earthquakes invites financial disaster.\u201cI don\u2019t want to belittle the public\u2019s concern about earthquake swarms. I live here, too,\u201d Robert G. Gum, a lawyer for New Dominion, said at an October hearing. \u201cBut it\u2019s no more important to the people sitting in this courtroom and the people in this state than the state\u2019s economy. It\u2019s no more important in recognizing how important the oil and gas industry is to that economy.\u201dIf juries hold the companies liable for Prague\u2019s earthquakes, he added, \u201cI doubt if this is the last lawsuit that will get filed. These wells will become economic and legal liability pariahs. They will be shut down.\u201dTo Ms. Cooper, that message is clear. \u201cPeople need to just take their losses for the greater good of the oil and gas companies \u2014 you know, do your part,\u201d she said.She does not buy it.\u201cIf the truth destroys something,\u201d she said, \u201cthen it needs to be destroyed.\u201dRichard A. Oppel Jr. reported from Prague, and Michael Wines from Oklahoma City. Elisa Cho contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "O\u2019Hare Noise Complaints Influence Chicago\u2019s Mayoral Race", "Date": "2015-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 In 15 minutes on a recent weekday evening, 18 noisy airplanes buzzed over Marie MacDonald\u2019s back porch. They flew past one after another: regional jets and jumbos, airliners and cargo planes, all rumbling above this city\u2019s Northwest Side on their final approach to O\u2019Hare International Airport.\u201cThey\u2019ve come to a point where they\u2019re going to make me a prisoner in my own house,\u201d said Ms. MacDonald, a 52-year-old teacher who moved to this mostly residential, middle-class neighborhood more than two years ago expecting solitude and quiet.That quiet has proved elusive. The Chicago Department of Aviation reported 39,500 noise complaints in the area around O\u2019Hare this January, up from 1,357 in January 2013, months before a new runway opened and flight patterns changed.The changes to O\u2019Hare, one of the world\u2019s busiest airports, had been planned before Mr. Emanuel took office, but the new runway at the center of the furor opened under his watch.Mr. Emanuel, who once represented part of the Northwest Side in Congress, says he has been responsive to the complaints. He says he has met with concerned residents, installed noise monitors and pushed the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates the nation\u2019s air traffic, to speed up a review of which homeowners are eligible for assistance installing insulation to dull the noise.\u201cMayor Emanuel is very sensitive to residents\u2019 concerns, which is why together with local aldermen, the city is working with federal partners to understand the extent and magnitude of the problem,\u201d said Kelley Quinn, a mayoral spokeswoman, in a statement. \u201cA number of steps have been taken to address airport noise, including a $700 million investment in communities neighboring both Chicago airports, as well as a $120 million investment to insulate 4,700 residences.\u201dWho Rahm Emanuel needs to win over to keep his seat in the April 7 runoff.On the Northwest Side, however, some say that is not enough. Largely because of the jet noise, Ms. MacDonald said she planned to support Mr. Emanuel\u2019s challenger, Jesus G. Garcia, in Tuesday\u2019s runoff election. Mr. Garcia, a county commissioner who goes by Chuy, has made the noise a campaign issue, and the topic has come up repeatedly in televised debates and on the campaign trail.\u201cI\u2019m concerned that your complaints about noise and your proposed solutions have fallen on deaf ears,\u201d Mr. Garcia said to residents at a recent campaign event on the Northwest Side. \u201cAs mayor, I will work with you to find solutions to cut noise pollution.\u201dMs. MacDonald lives on a block of well-kept homes about seven miles from O\u2019Hare, a safe but often overlooked slice of Chicago far from the bustling downtown. One of her neighbors, Anna Young, 88, said the recent uptick in plane traffic seemed to have interfered with her television antenna\u2019s signal, sometimes making it hard to watch her favorite shows: \u201cJeopardy!\u201d and \u201cWheel of Fortune.\u201dTo be sure, Mr. Emanuel retains significant support in this part of Chicago, where yard signs for both candidates can be spotted amid the rows of brick bungalows and two-story houses. In the first round of the mayoral election in February, Mr. Emanuel won about 48 percent of votes in Ms. MacDonald and Ms. Young\u2019s ward, compared with around 35 percent for Mr. Garcia.But in the buildup to the runoff, a group of residents called the Fair Allocation in Runways Coalition has become more visible, staging a protest outside a mayoral debate and speaking critically of Mr. Emanuel and his handling of the noise complaints.One of the coalition\u2019s leaders, Lisa Ziems, introduced Mr. Garcia at his recent campaign stop in the Jefferson Park neighborhood, near Ms. MacDonald\u2019s house. Though Ms. Ziems always heard some planes flying over her house, she said the uptick since 2013 was so unbearable that she sometimes had trouble reading books to her children.\u201cNinety percent of the time,\u201d she said in an interview, \u201cit\u2019s this constant railroad in the sky.\u201dThe changes that led to the complaints stem from a broader, continuing project to modernize O\u2019Hare, which handled more than 60,000 flights in February and serves as a hub for both United and American Airlines. The new runway was promoted as a way to increase efficiency and build capacity at the airport.Officials at the F.A.A. said last week that they had worked with community members to address noise problems, and that they had held meetings before the runway changes were made. But many on the Northwest Side say they did not know about the new runway until it was open and now are left worrying about the impact on their sleep and property values.The issue, though, is a complex one, and the difficult truth is that one neighborhood\u2019s reprieve from the noise can come at another\u2019s expense. Officials have published a map suggesting that the changes to O\u2019Hare would concentrate the noise over a smaller area than before, a boon for some Chicago neighborhoods and suburbs.Even as they promise to listen to residents\u2019 concerns, Mr. Garcia and Mr. Emanuel also emphasize O\u2019Hare\u2019s importance to Chicago\u2019s economy and the fact that the airport will not be going anywhere. Most residents who bought homes near O\u2019Hare say they understand that plane noise will not disappear altogether.\u201cI\u2019m not a zealot,\u201d Ms. MacDonald said. \u201cBut it can\u2019t be all day, all night and every minute and a half.\u201dCritics say that the current situation is untenable, and that more should be done to direct jets over less populated areas and to use a variety of runways. Ms. MacDonald, who describes herself as \u201cpretty apolitical,\u201d has placed an anti-noise sign in her front yard. Even indoors with her windows closed, she can hear the planes above.\u201cIt makes me so angry,\u201d Ms. MacDonald said. \u201cYou invest your life\u2019s savings, and your home is supposed to be your sanctuary. And for them to exercise eminent domain over the top of your house?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Encourage Healthier Eating", "Date": "2015-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:In the last six years alone, the Agriculture Department has invested billions to expand access to healthy food, including building new grocery stores in underserved areas, increasing access for food stamp users at farmers\u2019 markets, pushing for improvements to school meals, and testing innovative strategies to eliminate hunger, particularly among children.The suggestion to mandate a minimum amount of shelf space for healthy foods like fresh fruits and vegetables in urban neighborhood stores is laudable, but in the long run reinforces a misconception that only fresh fruits and vegetables count, whereas frozen don\u2019t.Increasing fruit and vegetable intake is an important step toward improving diet quality, both in terms of the nutrients they provide and the less nutritious and calorie-dense foods they replace. However, fresh fruits and vegetables are expensive, highly perishable and particularly for vegetables can be labor-intensive to prepare.Frozen fruits and vegetables are more affordable, as nutritious, less perishable and quicker to use during food preparation than their fresh counterparts. Instead of focusing on \u201cfresh\u201d fruits and vegetables, mandating a minimum amount of shelf space for frozen options would serve the same purpose. Given the availability of freezer space for frozen desserts, this would be an easy change.The writer is a professor of nutrition science and policy at Tufts University and the director of its Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory.A primary justification behind a ban on using federal food stamps for junk food is that it is against the public interest for tax dollars to add fuel to a health crisis caused by poor diets. That logic dictates that we make such a policy more universal and not confined only to low-income people.Every year, public dollars are used when federal employees buy junk food while on official travel and, presumably, when federal agencies host conferences and other events.Extending a junk-food ban more broadly to federal employees might be difficult to enforce, but it would send an important message that if the federal government is going to ban using public funds for junk food, then it will be blind to income and employment status. Even partial compliance would be a step in the right direction.The writer is senior vice president of the California Endowment, a private health foundation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andorra Cracks Down on Bank After U.S. Accusations of Money Laundering", "Date": "2015-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANDORRA \u2014 In the clubby world of banking here in this tiny Pyrenees principality, where money comes and goes under only the partial purview of European regulators, there had long been whispers: Was there something fishy about one of Andorra\u2019s five privately held banks, Banca Privada d\u2019Andorra?Andorran judiciary officials had also raised questions. Whether for lack of expertise or energy, their investigations went nowhere.Andorran authorities are now taking action against B.P.A., including the arrest of Joan Pau Miquel Prats, the bank\u2019s chief executive.\u201cBuilding up a legal case over money laundering has its difficulties,\u201d Gilbert Saboya Suny\u00e9, Andorra\u2019s foreign minister, said in an interview. \u201cYou have to understand that such investigations are often very dependent on information that the investigating country doesn\u2019t have.\u201dWhile some Andorran banking executives are adopting an \u201cI told you so\u201d attitude, local depositors whose B.P.A. accounts are now semifrozen are exasperated with the seemingly free rein given to the bank\u2019s management and two brothers, Higini and Ramon Cierco, who were chairmen of the bank and whose family controlled it.\u201cI just can\u2019t believe we couldn\u2019t stop earlier a bank from handling so much crime money,\u201d said Carmen Panadero, who described herself as a housewife.With the five banks and their combined assets of about 16 billion euros, or $17 billion, being so integral to the economy of Andorra, which has only 80,000 residents, it might not be surprising that the government gained little traction in past efforts to investigate B.P.A.In late 2012, for instance, an Andorran court froze about \u20ac200 million held with B.P.A. by Venezuelan clients tied to the government of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Last year, however, an Andorran judge unblocked the Venezuelan accounts because there was no conclusive evidence of the alleged money laundering that had prompted the action.The B.P.A. scandal is the latest evidence that under the Obama administration, \u201cthe U.S. has increasingly taken it upon itself to go after white-collar crime, even where the actors are all overseas,\u201d said Patrick O\u2019Donnell, a partner at Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis, a Washington law firm. \u201cI think it also reflects a U.S. government perspective that overseas regulators aren\u2019t doing quite enough.\u201dWhether any B.P.A. bank officials go to trial, the severity of the American claims has forced Andorra\u2019s government to take measures to ring-fence B.P.A. from the rest of the financial sector.After setting up an emergency credit line of up to \u20ac100 million for B.P.A.\u2019s corporate clients, the Andorran authorities are now hoping to sell B.P.A.\u2019s legitimate assets \u2014 split from whatever illicit money it is accused of handling for corrupt Venezuelan government officials, Russian and Chinese criminal rings, and the Mexican Sinaloa drug cartel.A spokesman for the Treasury Department\u2019s crime-fighting unit could not discuss the next steps. American officials, however, visited Andorra shortly after publishing their concerns.For more than a year before the American report, Spain had been investigating Banco Madrid, the Spanish subsidiary of B.P.A.The Spanish inquiry by Sepblac, the agency that fights money laundering, stemmed from earlier arrests of two men in separate cases. One is Gao Ping, a Chinese businessman, who is now in a Spanish prison awaiting trial in a case of fraudulent trade shipments between Spain and China. The other is Andrey Petrov, a Russian accused of bribing Spanish officials on behalf of Russian criminal gangs in connection with property transactions.A spokeswoman for Spain\u2019s Economy Ministry said that the day before the United States report was published, Sepblac had informed Banco Madrid of the results of its investigation. Sepblac\u2019s findings, however, have not been made public.Andorra, wedged between France and Spain, is not a member of the 28-nation European Union, but it falls under the supervision of some European regulators. Andorran officials stressed that Andorra had passed four reviews conducted in recent years by Moneyval, the anti-money-laundering committee of the Council of Europe.Like other Andorran banks, B.P.A. had weathered the euro debt crisis, emerging from it with a \u20ac20.5 million profit in 2013. Its 2011 takeover of Banco Madrid also made B.P.A. the first Andorran bank to get a Spanish banking license.\u201cThe crisis of 2008 was a sort of blessing for Andorra,\u201d said Oriol Ribas, vice chairman of one of the country\u2019s other financial institutions, Andbank. \u201cMany overseas clients came to us because they were disgusted with what their banks had sold them.\u201dBut in the case of B.P.A., United States authorities say, some clients came to the bank for its willingness to look the other way.Some rival bankers suggested that B.P.A.\u2019s aggressive pursuit of clients had, in fact, long raised concerns within a close-knit financial community, in which a small number of extended families dominate the banking industry. B.P.A. was evidently considered something of a black sheep.It is \u201ca bank that has long been seen here as having lower moral values,\u201d Mr. Ribas said. \u201cCertainly none of the other banks was looking to merge with them.\u201dXavier Cornella Castel, the chairman of Andorra\u2019s banking association, said that \u201cit\u2019s clear that this bank had a level of risk tolerance higher than the rest of the sector.\u201dB.P.A.\u2019s controlling family, the Ciercos, also owns gas stations, hotels and other real estate inside and outside Andorra. Ramon Cierco is a director of F.C. Barcelona, the soccer club.The brothers have been ousted, alongside the other members of B.P.A.\u2019s board, by the Andorran government. But they have not been charged, and the American report did not name any B.P.A. executives as part of its claims of criminal wrongdoing.In a statement, lawyers for the Ciercos said the brothers had ordered an internal investigation of the Treasury accusations and were cooperating with the American, Andorran and Spanish authorities.The Ciercos, their lawyers said, \u201care confident that the record will show that they discharged their duties as directors with diligence and integrity.\u201dAndorran officials say that B.P.A. was an isolated case of flawed corporate governance that should not unfairly tarnish the principality\u2019s whole banking sector.\u201cWhen there is a problem with a bank in a country that only has five, it creates more noise,\u201d said Mr. Saboya, the foreign minister.Still, the B.P.A. scandal is a particular blow to Andorra because it has hit the reputation of a country that was not removed until 2009 from a list of \u201cuncooperative tax havens\u201d drawn up by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Andorra\u2019s government recently hired consultants from PricewaterhouseCoopers to comb through B.P.A.\u2019s balance sheet. But Andorra\u2019s plan to then sell at least part of B.P.A. could still be derailed by the United States Justice Department and a possible American fine, especially since B.P.A. is accused of processing hundreds of millions of dollars through four correspondent banks in the United States. Washington could also seek extraditions.This time the United States is targeting a bank with only \u20ac3.3 billion of assets.But Mr. O\u2019Donnell, the Washington lawyer, said, \u201cI would be very surprised if the Department of Justice went away anytime soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "OAS, Brazilian Engineering Company, Seeks Bankruptcy Protection", "Date": "2015-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe move has been expected since January, when the company missed a bond payment.OAS has nearly $1.8 billion in global bonds and an additional 3.4 billion reais ($1.05 billion) in local debt.A police investigation, known as Operation Car Wash, into a multibillion-dollar bribery scheme has cited OAS as among the 23 companies that may have funneled money from inflated contracts to their own executives, to Petrobras executives, and to political parties that support President Dilma Rousseff.Petrobras, the largest client for nearly all these companies, has halted payments and frozen contracts with all 23, and the financial markets have refused to lend money to keep them afloat.OAS is the third big Petrobras subcontractor to request a bankruptcy court\u2019s protection, after Alumini Engenharia,which defaulted on 1 billion reais in January, and Galv\u00e3o Engenharia, which defaulted on about 1.6 billion reais this month.The central bank estimated in December that Petrobras\u2019s engineering subcontractors together had 130 billion reais ($40 billion) in debt to local banks and suppliers.And with nearly every major engineering and construction company under investigation, the government\u2019s plan to attract billions in foreign investment to upgrade the country\u2019s dilapidated infrastructure may also face difficulties.The Car Wash investigation is proving a watershed for the country\u2019s justice system, which is showing a new appetite for punishing corruption and other white collar crime.The courts have kept 11 executives from six of the companies \u2014 among them OAS\u2019s chief executive, Jos\u00e9 Aldem\u00e1rio Pinheiro Filho \u2014 in jail since November.The federal prosecutor\u2019s office is also suing six companies, including OAS, for damages caused by corruption.Despite the company\u2019s legal problems, OAS\u2019s creditors are likely to get at least some of their money back. If Petrobras resumes payments, OAS will have a strong cash flow, and the company also has valuable assets. Its owns several sports stadiums and a 25 percent stake in Invepar, the company that runs Latin America\u2019s busiest airport and the Rio de Janeiro subway system.The private equity giants Advent International and GP Investments have been reported to be interested in buying OAS\u2019s stake in Invepar.But Omar Zeolla, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company, noted that OAS\u2019s stake in Invepar is now the subject of a legal dispute, and he said that \u201cbankruptcy courts in Brazil can be unpredictable and very slow.\u201dOAS has long been famous for its political connections. The company\u2019s founder and controlling shareholder, C\u00e9sar Mata Pires, is married to the daughter of Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Magalh\u00e3es, who was a three-time state governor, a two-time senator and a national power broker until his death in 2007.And OAS took advantage of Brazilian laws that permit companies to make generous donations to political campaigns.According to figures from the national electoral tribunal, OAS donated over 20 million reais to President Rousseff in 2014 \u2014 nearly 6 percent of her re-election campaign\u2019s official budget. OAS also donated 4 million reais to Ms. Rousseff\u2019s opponent, A\u00e9cio Neves.Police searching OAS\u2019s offices in November found lists of presents, including luxury watches and fine wines, given to leading politicians.OAS has 60 days to present the court with its restructuring plan. The company said on Tuesday that its plan would include sales both of assets and of several subsidiaries that were not included in the request for court protection.The consulting firms G5 Evercore and McKinsey are advising OAS on its restructuring, according to a local newspaper, Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo.Advertisement"}

Across the street, Jas Beauty Mart was closed; a man and a little boy ate from a lunchbox while a police officer in riot gear stood watch a yard or two away.\u201cThere is so much history in this area,\u201d said Kina Brock, 29, who was walking through the intersection on Tuesday with her 7-year-old son. \u201cBut there\u2019s no love for it all by anyone.\u201d The problem, she added, \u201cstarts right with the resources that are put into the community.\u201dDiagonally across the street from the destroyed CVS, inside the Arch Social Club, said to be the second-oldest African-American group of its kind in the country, Kaleb Tshamba has watched the neighborhood deteriorate to the point that people describe the intersection just beyond his building\u2019s glass doors as \u201can open-air drug market.\u201d The drug crisis accelerated, he and others said, in the past decade or two, and particularly when the economy worsened.\u201cOnce they get caught up in the game, they\u2019re caught up. It becomes a lifestyle,\u201d said Mr. Tshamba, 65, a retiree who lives about four blocks away and is the chairman of the social club\u2019s board. \u201cThey\u2019re caught up in the drug game, and that\u2019s the only job that\u2019s out there. You\u2019ll see kids \u2014 13, 14, 15, 16 \u2014 and they\u2019re selling for someone else.\u201dResidents said a nearby rehabilitation center might have contributed to the problems, because addicts from across Baltimore flocked there and, in some instances, ultimately bought drugs in a place that had become newly familiar to them.But perceptions of the area and the depths of its despair vary, as do the day-to-day experiences of the people who live here.Carlos Ray, 29, said that he sometimes heard gunfire echo in the night, and that his girlfriend saw a man with a firearm chasing another man up a street on Sunday. And Tameka Christian, a nurse who has lived on an especially tranquil block here for 22 years, said conditions shifted by street.\u201cThis block is kind of quiet and peaceful, and we\u2019ve never really had too many problems or incidents on the block,\u201d Ms. Christian, 35, said outside her home, yards from Pennsylvania Avenue. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t really say much for Pennsylvania Avenue. It\u2019s a lot of rowdy people, the drug addicts, the rowdy kids. They just make it bad around here.\u201dThe day after chaos erupted across Baltimore, people who were assembled near a looted CVS drugstore discussed the violence.A short walk away, on West North Avenue, Curline Davis maintained that many of the neighborhood\u2019s problems had their origins elsewhere and that \u201cthe people that make trouble here do not live here.\u201dBut she also acknowledged that the area had shifted since the late 1980s, when she first moved here, particularly as older residents died.\u201cIt\u2019s gotten worse,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s good, on and off. But all of a sudden, people see where they can take up residence and come on your steps and carry on, and then you have to have the force to say, \u2018Don\u2019t sit on my step.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u201cYou have,\u201d she said, \u201cto come out and demand your neighborhood.\u201dDespite the evolving attitudes and challenges, residents said many traditions continued to resonate in this history-rich part of Baltimore, where Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American member of the United States Supreme Court, attended high school. On Monday night, when an unruly clamor shook the region, the social club sustained no damage at the hands of the rioters, whom the police routinely described as youths.\u201cTheir parents would be mad,\u201d Mr. Tshamba said in a room filled with photographs of the club\u2019s former leaders, short histories of the group and a municipal proclamation celebrating it. \u201cThis place is historic. The only people who would have hit us would have been the criminal element that would have hit us from the back.\u201dGov. Larry Hogan of Maryland declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard when riots broke out after the funeral of Freddie Gray.But others said there were more fundamental senses of injustice at work as the violence raged on Monday. The destruction at certain businesses, some argued, was a result of people feeling a sharp disconnect from the storefronts that dot their neighborhood, including CVS and a check-cashing company.\u201cThere is a reason for each and every one of them,\u201d Perry Hopkins, a community organizer, said of the businesses that were damaged. \u201cYou\u2019ll notice that some got hit and some didn\u2019t.\u201dResidents spent Tuesday considering the consequences of the riots. Mr. Ray, for instance, wondered where he would buy diapers, and others talked of transferring prescriptions to pharmacies elsewhere in the city.But more searing and enduring questions also haunted the area: questions of what will come of it once the shards of glass are gone and the police officers retreat. Mr. Hopkins was among those who were skeptical that the neighborhood could shed its troubles with any haste.\u201cSame people, same culture, same every day,\u201d he said.On West North Avenue, where the brick rowhouses are either neatly maintained or boarded up, and not far from one of the street-corner churches here, Ms. Davis expressed some optimism.\u201cThere is hope,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is hope.

Virginia ships many products to Cuba, including soybeans, soy milk and apples.Todd P. Haymore, secretary of agriculture and forestry for Virginia, said he believed this existing relationship would give his state a head start as trade barriers between the countries fall. \u201cWe have worked very hard to build the relationship since 2007,\u201d he said, \u201cso we are in a good spot when the pipeline opens up.\u201dMr. Haymore has been to Cuba nine times since 2007, and Virginia\u2019s governor, Terry McAuliffe, has announced plans to travel to the island later this year.\u201cHe is waving the flag and tooting the horn and saying \u2018New York is ready to work,\u2019 and that is what governors do,\u201d he said.As for Mr. Dobbins, the apple producer, his foray into Cuba was short-lived. Undercut by red tape and competitors with cheaper, lower-quality products, he sold only one container of produce, roughly 113,000 apples. He plans to revisit his company\u2019s relationship with Cuba in coming months, but says he is realistic that it will take some time for conditions to change.Others are more optimistic. Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, traveled to Cuba this month on a fact-finding mission, and says the country is abuzz about the prospect of stronger ties with the United States.\u201cMany of the young people are really excited,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey want a McDonald\u2019s.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 87.The cause was complications of colon cancer, his son Maurice said.In 1951, fresh out of New York University, where he studied engineering and business, Mr. Haroche teamed up with a classmate, Fred Kassner, to open a two-desk, two-telephone agency in Times Square, which they called Liberty Travel. At its peak, in the late 1990s, the company, based in Ramsey, N.J., had 3,200 employees in 300 offices in 45 states.In 2008, Liberty, which was privately held, and its subsidiary, Gogo Worldwide Vacations, which markets packages to other travel agencies, were acquired by Flight Centre, an Australian travel company, for a reported $135 million. The two partners were in their 20s when they began expanding to destinations beyond the Catskills, like Miami, the Caribbean, Mexico and Hawaii. They pioneered discount \u201cdeluxe economy packages\u201d that included airfare, hotel, car rentals, transfers and other extras that a traveler typically would have had to book separately. Maurice Haroche said that Liberty became the fifth-largest travel agency in the United States, including corporate travel agencies, and the largest in leisure travel.

She\u2019s starting low-key, engaging in small sessions with average voters. But soon she will prefer a focus on issues, even controversial ones, over news reports about her e-mail indiscretions or donations to the Clinton Foundation.John D. Podesta, her politically savvy campaign chairman, is policy-centric. Conversations with a half-dozen Democratic policy experts suggest the broad outlines of a predictably progressive Clinton agenda that differs from President Obama\u2019s more in emphasis than substance.The conventional wisdom that she is more conservative than the president is wrong when it comes to domestic and economic issues. In the 2008 campaign contest, Mrs. Clinton offered the more liberal health care proposal. In 2007, she advocated regulation of financial derivatives; Mr. Obama didn\u2019t take that on until he was in the White House.She is more interventionist on foreign policy. As a senator, she supported the Iraq war, and in 2011, she was a champion of intervening in Libya. For now, she\u2019s likely to play down those views, which are anathema to the party\u2019s liberal activists.The best guide to her domestic agenda would be the policy prescriptions of the Center for American Progress, a progressive research organization headed by Neera Tanden, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policy director in the 2008 presidential campaign.She is likely to stress the middle class more than poverty, while putting a spotlight on wealth disparity, arguing that far too much of the economy\u2019s gains are going to the superrich. Echoing the Summers report, she is going to explore ways to give workers more power, which could include policies based on the German or Scandinavian models that encourage business and worker cooperation to improve productivity.She inevitably will propose a middle-class tax cut. The only questions are when, and whether it will focus on cutting payroll taxes or lowering rates.She\u2019ll propose paying for any change by closing loopholes.Don\u2019t expect any Elizabeth Warren-style populist rhetoric about breaking up the banks. Nonetheless, Mrs. Clinton is eager to show she isn\u2019t a handmaiden of Wall Street or a corporate Democrat. She\u2019ll want to maintain the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. She may even add a few new rules and call for cracking down on practices such as the ability of corporate chief executives to approve stock buybacks that enrich them personally.There will be a focus on public-private partnerships. At a recent event by the Center for American Progress, her eyes lit up when experts compared Pittsburgh, a city that is thriving because government and the private sector work together, and distressed Detroit, where that rarely happens.On foreign policy, she\u2019ll take a tough line on Russia; President Vladimir V. Putin and the Clintons show a reciprocal animosity. She\u2019ll call for more engagement with China and, to the consternation of labor supporters, she will back trade deals, but with some conditions.In the Middle East, she supports the administration\u2019s fight against the Islamic State militant group. She also will back any nuclear deal with Iran, if it\u2019s finalized, because as secretary of state she had a role in the initial policy.However, she will strike a friendlier tone with Israel than this administration. Some associates predict that she would break with Mr. Obama if he decided not to veto a Palestinian statehood resolution at the United Nations.She\u2019ll have to flesh out important specifics of all this, because the 2016 contest, like most elections without an incumbent president, will be about the future, not the past.Advertisement"}

Nothing, however, prepared me for his first novel, \u201cThe Meursault Investigation,\u201d a thrilling retelling of Albert Camus\u2019s 1942 classic, \u201cThe Stranger,\u201d from the perspective of the brother of the Arab killed by Meursault, Camus\u2019s antihero. The novel, which was first published in Algeria in 2013, and which will be published in English by Other Press in June, not only breathes new life into \u201cThe Stranger\u201d; it also offers a bracing critique of postcolonial Algeria \u2014 a new country that Camus, a poor Frenchman born in Algiers, did not live to see.What impressed me about Daoud\u2019s writing, both his journalism and his novel, was the fearlessness with which he defended the cause of individual liberty \u2014 a fearlessness that, it seemed to me, bordered on recklessness in a country where collectivist passions of nation and faith run high. I wondered whether his experience might provide clues as to the state of intellectual freedom in Algeria, a peculiar hybrid of electoral democracy and police state. Late last year, I had an answer of sorts. Daoud was no longer merely a writer. He was now someone you had to take a side on, in Algeria and in France.His ordeal began on Dec. 13, during a book tour in France, where \u201cMeursault\u201d received rapturous reviews, sold more than 100,000 copies and came two votes shy of winning the Prix Goncourt, the nation\u2019s most prestigious literary prize. He was on a popular late-night talk show called \u201cOn n\u2019est pas Couch\u00e9\u201d (\u201cWe\u2019re Not Asleep\u201d), and he felt, he would tell me later, \u201cas if I had all of Algeria on my shoulders.\u201d He insisted to the French-Lebanese journalist L\u00e9a Salam\u00e9, one of the panelists on the program, that he considered himself an Algerian, not an Arab \u2014 a view that\u2019s not uncommon in Algeria, but that is opposed by Arab nationalists. He said that he spoke a distinct language called \u201cAlgerian,\u201d not Arabic. He said that he preferred to meet with God on foot, by himself, rather than in an \u201corganized trip\u201d to a mosque, and that religious orthodoxy had become an obstacle to progress in the Muslim world. Daoud said nothing on the program that he hadn\u2019t said in his columns or his novel. But saying it in France, the country that ruled Algeria from 1830 to 1962, got him noticed by people back home who tend to ignore the French-language press.One of them was an obscure imam named Abdelfattah Hamadache, who had reportedly been an informer for the security services. Three days after Daoud\u2019s appearance on French television, Hamadache wrote on his Facebook page that Daoud \u2014 an \u201capostate\u201d and \u201cZionized criminal\u201d \u2014 should be put on trial for insulting Islam and publicly executed. It was not quite a call for Daoud\u2019s assassination: Hamadache was appealing to the state, not to freelance jihadists. But Algeria is a country in which more than 70 journalists were murdered by Islamist rebels during the civil war of the 1990s, the so-called Black Decade. Those murders were often preceded by anonymous threats in letters, leaflets or graffiti scrawled on the walls of mosques. Hamadache\u2019s \u201cFacebook fatwa,\u201d as it became known, was something new, and uniquely brazen, for being signed in his own name. It provoked an outcry, and not only among liberals. Ali Belhadj, leader of the banned Islamic Salvation Front (F.I.S.), harshly criticized Hamadache, asserting that he had no authority to call Daoud an apostate and that only God had the right to decide who was or wasn\u2019t a Muslim: a message, some said, that the F.I.S. saw Hamadache as a tool of the state. Indeed, although the minister of religious affairs, Mohamed A\u00efssa, a mild-mannered man of Sufi leanings, came to Daoud\u2019s defense, the government otherwise maintained a strange neutrality, declining to respond when Daoud filed a complaint against Hamadache for incitement.That neutrality reflects something deeper than political expedience. The principal lesson that the Algerian state drew from the decade-long war with Islamist insurgents was that Islamism could not be defeated on the battlefield: It had to be co-opted rather than crushed. In effect, Algeria is running a decade ahead of other countries where secular elites are clashing with powerful Islamist movements over the shape of new governments after the Arab uprisings. Now it is prosperous and has a growing sense of confidence that the Algerian model of power-sharing can and should be exported to neighbors like Libya and Tunisia. The Daoud Affair, however, is putting the Algerian model to the test.Today, Algeria\u2019s d\u00e9cideurs \u2014 the men who actually make decisions, as opposed to the politicians who bicker in its pluralist but impotent National Assembly \u2014 have two claims to legitimacy. The first is that they liberated Algeria from French rule. The second is that they defeated a wave of Islamist terrorism in the 1990s. In Daoud\u2019s view, neither achievement is enough. Algeria will be truly free only when it has been \u201cliberated from its liberators.\u201d It is not simply a matter of overthrowing the government, which he believes was the great illusion of the Arab Spring. Society, too, needs to change if Algeria is to release itself from the fetters of authoritarianism and Islamic piety.The protests in Oran, where anti-Islamist sentiment runs high, were much smaller than in Algiers, but still boisterous enough to hold up traffic. I was heading to my hotel from the airport with Robert Parks, an American academic who is a close friend of Daoud\u2019s. Parks, who has run a research center in Oran since 2006, had been telling me that Algeria was slowly but surely recovering its confidence. Algerians, he said, were grateful to have avoided the tumult of the Arab revolts, thanks to which they had been able to make a more sober, judicious and favorable appraisal of their own conditions. But when a group of young demonstrators marched toward us, he swerved into a back road: he was worried that we would be mistaken for Frenchmen.There\u2019s no doubt that Algeria has made strides since the Black Decade. Although Bouteflika has hardly appeared in public since his stroke in 2013, he remains relatively popular, if only for lack of an alternative, and is widely credited with rebuilding Algeria after the civil war. When I reported from Algeria in 2003, a year after the war officially ended, it was a jittery, traumatized place, and people were still afraid of car bombs and fake checkpoints set up by rebels. Although radical jihadists are still active in the east and the south, today the country is largely safe, not only in the cities but on the roads connecting them. The new East-West highway, built with Chinese labor, has cut in half the drive from Algiers to Oran, once a 10-hour journey. The economy remains heavily dependent on natural gas and oil (more than 90 percent of its exports), but it has nearly $200 billion in foreign-currency reserves. Algeria has earned the admiration of Western powers, above all the United States, for its role in regional counterterrorism, for the expertise and efficiency of the intelligence services and for its resourceful diplomatic efforts in Tunisia, Libya and Mali. In the words of its energetic foreign minister, Ramtane Lamamra, Algeria is \u201can exporter of security and stability.\u201dAt midnight, when we arrived, the crowd seemed tentative, but when Cheba Dalila, a ra\u00ef singer with a voice as deep as Nina Simone\u2019s, came on at 2 a.m., the dance floor filled up. She strode with her microphone from table to table, collecting bills from people who paid to have their names mentioned in her songs. The bass was so loud I felt it in my belly. A woman in tight jeans wore a T-shirt that said \u201cDetroit 1983\u201d; pairs of men danced with women when their interest was plainly in each other. I took a photograph, but Mekahli\u2019s son, Hadi, told me not to: \u201cThis place is run by the mafia.\u201d The \u201cmafia\u201d makes its money on bootleg liquor and prostitutes. Some of the women at the nightclub were apparently for hire. \u201cFor me,\u201d Mekahli said, \u201cclubs like this are a reappropriation of Algerian identity. France doesn\u2019t exist here. The people here are totally decolonized.\u201dThe great theme of Daoud\u2019s writing is the Algerian condition. To be Algerian, he argues, is to be \u201cschizophrenic,\u201d torn between religious piety and liberal individualism. The liquor stores in Oran are legal but concealed; a ring of traffic forms around them on Thursday evening, the night before prayers. There is a growing acceptance of sex outside marriage, but women are seen as little more than prostitutes if they walk into a cafe for men. Algerians are becoming more modern, but on the down low, as if they were loath to admit it to themselves. Hypocrisy might be a step on the arduous road to a more tolerant civil society, but it exasperates Daoud. \u201cThe Islamists have at least made their choice,\u201d he said.The coercive pressure to unify has always been a defining feature of Algerian nationalism. During the struggle for independence, the leaders of the F.L.N., many of whom were Berbers, suppressed Berber identity politics in the name of national unity against the French. Since independence, as Daoud points out, Algerians have been taught to see themselves as belonging exclusively to the Arab-Islamic world and to deny what they know from their history and experience: that most are of Berber, not Arabic ancestry; that a large minority still speaks either Berber, a language that only recently was recognized as a national language, or French, which became a \u201cforeign language\u201d after independence; and that even the Arabic most Algerians speak at home is a creole larded with words on loan from other tongues. (Hence Daoud\u2019s insistence on calling it \u201cAlgerian.\u201d) Far from representing an alternative to the ideology of Arab-Islamic unity, Algeria\u2019s Islamists preach a more religious version of it. As a result, Algeria remains, in Daoud\u2019s view, \u201cstranded between the sky and the land. The land belongs to \u2018the liberators,\u2019\u2009\u201d while \u201cthe sky has been colonized by religious people who have appropriated it in the name of Allah.\u201d Algerians \u201chave been persuaded that they are impotent; they can\u2019t even build a wall without Chinese help.\u201dThis sense of impotence finds physical expression in Algeria\u2019s decrepit infrastructure. \u201cThe streets of Oran are doomed to dust, pebbles and heat,\u201d Camus wrote in an essay. \u201cIf it rains, there is a deluge and a sea of mud.\u201d Once you\u2019re off the main roads, it\u2019s no better today. On a rainy night I drove with Daoud to a dinner in a secluded bourgeois neighborhood of Oran. The streets were a brown porridge, and we nearly got stuck. \u201cWhat a mess,\u201d he exploded. Daoud, who is obsessed with cleanliness, thinks that Algeria\u2019s tolerance for dirt is a political symptom, even a spiritual one. Under French rule, Algerians were violently dispossessed of their land. Because the domestic interior was all that they owned, they came to see public space as something that didn\u2019t belong to them; as France\u2019s property, it was someone else\u2019s problem. After independence, it became the state\u2019s problem. Religion only reinforced the notion that everyday problems were in the hands of a higher authority. \u201cOur ecological problems are also metaphysical,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who are waiting for the end of the world can\u2019t be bothered with the present.\u201dHe might have been describing the Islam that he knew as a child in Mesra, a village in northwestern Algeria. The Daouds, he said, \u201cwere sure of their faith, so they didn\u2019t feel they had to defend it, unlike the Islamists today, who are incredibly fragile.\u201d The same was true of his family\u2019s attachment to the land: They were patriots who lived through the War of Independence but felt no need to deny \u201cthe complexities of life under colonialism.\u201d In school, he learned \u201ca single story,\u201d a black-and-white tale of infallible mujahedeen battling evil French settlers. At home, though, his grandparents told him about the impoverished French they knew in Mesra; about the Catholic priest who fed the family in times of shortage; about French soldiers who deserted their posts, rather than torture and kill. Later he would learn that his father\u2019s first great love was not his mother but a Frenchwoman with whom he was involved during the war.The eldest of six children, Daoud was born in 1970, when Algeria was widely seen as a postcolonial success. Its president, Col. Houari Boumediene, enigmatic and taciturn, was an authoritarian strongman, but he transformed Algeria into a regional player, a leader of the nonaligned movement. Under Boumediene, who seized power in a military coup three years after independence, the army became the dominant institution in Algerian life. Daoud\u2019s father, Mohamed, was a gendarme. In spite of his poverty, he was able, as \u201ca member of a rising generation,\u201d to marry a woman from a prosperous, landed family outside of Mesra, socially his superior.Mohamed Daoud, who studied in French schools, was the only member of the family who could read. He taught his son the alphabet and shared his small library of books in French. At the library in Mostaganem, the port city where Kamel Daoud attended school, he read Jules Verne, \u201cDune\u201d and works of Greek mythology. But the book that most captivated him was \u201cThe Revival of the Religious Sciences,\u201d by Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, an itinerant 11th-century Persian theologian who, after a crisis of faith, tried to purify his soul through mystical experience. Daoud said that after reading al-Ghazali at age 13 \u201cthe Quran was no longer enough for me. It was merely the visible face of a hidden text.\u201d In order to decipher that concealed, more sacred text, he became increasingly ascetic. He kept a stone in his mouth to prevent himself from speaking, after reading that silence opens the heart to God. Daoud wanted to be a writer, but he also wanted to become an imam. \u201cIt was a contradiction, but I didn\u2019t experience this as a contradiction,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you pray, you construct meaning, just as you do when you write. God is your only reader, but in essence, it\u2019s the same thing.\u201dAt first, the Quran won out. Religion was a more promising career path than literature for an ambitious Algerian teenager in the early 1980s. President Chadli Bendjedid, who came to power in 1979, two months after Boumediene\u2019s death, rolled back his predecessor\u2019s project of socialist land reform and began to liberalize the economy. The shops were flooded with Western consumer products, but \u201cde-Boumedienization\u201d left an ideological void. Bendjedid filled it with Islam and Arab identity. He put down the \u201cBerber Spring\u201d of 1980, a nonviolent movement that called for the recognition of Berber culture and language, intensified the Arabization of education and presided over a mosque-building spree.Emboldened by these changes, the Islamist movement, which had been tightly controlled under Boumediene, began to train a generation of young militants. Daoud, a young Islamic mystic in a djellaba and turban, was recruited by his geography teacher, a member of an Islamist cell. He introduced him to the writings of Abul Ala Mawdudi, Sayyid Qutb and Hassan al-Banna \u2014 the founders of modern Sunni Islamism \u2014 and persuaded him that the individual salvation he sought could be achieved only through collective salvation, in the form of an Islamic state. Daoud grew a beard, handed out leaflets and became the imam of his high school. At an Islamist-run summer camp, \u201cwe lived as if we were companions of the Prophet.\u201d It was in camps and athletic clubs that the young militants of Algeria\u2019s emerging Islamic movement were indoctrinated, and Daoud appeared to be on his way to becoming a leader. But when he turned 18, Daoud quit the movement. \u201cI felt I had the right to live and to rebel,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd I was tired. At a certain point, I no longer felt anything. I don\u2019t know if this is what losing faith means. But what\u2019s dangerous for a religious person isn\u2019t temptation, it\u2019s fatigue.\u201dOn Oct. 5, 1988, three months after he broke with Islamism, Algeria experienced the first in a series of violent anti-government demonstrations. Daoud went to Mostaganem, armed with a chain, hoping to \u201cbreak stuff.\u201d By the time he arrived, the military had started to fire on people. An old man tried to use him as a human shield. He was saved by a woman who took him by the arm and, pretending that she was his mother, led him to safety. \u201cI was furious at that generation of men, men who would hide behind a young man,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed very symbolic to me.\u201d Several hundred Algerians died in Black October. The following year, a new constitution was adopted, legalizing political parties other than the National Liberation Front and thereby dismantling the one-party state. The Islamic Salvation Front emerged as the country\u2019s most powerful opposition party.In January 1992, the army canceled the second round of national elections, in order to prevent the Islamic Salvation Front from coming to power. Deprived of victory at the polls, Islamists took up arms, and a brutal civil war erupted. Daoud, who was studying French at the University of Oran, opposed the cancellation of the elections, but \u201cI really didn\u2019t care. I was an individualist. I hated everyone. I looked at the events from a distance, and I thought, They\u2019re going to eat each other up.\u201d He had chosen a much more personal form of rebellion, in literature, music and beer, though he would not take his first sip of wine, which is specifically proscribed in the Quran, until he was 30. He read Baudelaire, Borges and the Syrian poet Adonis, and began to write poetry and fiction.\u201cThe Meursault Investigation\u201d arose from one of his columns. The premise is ingenious: that \u201cThe Stranger,\u201d about the murder of an unnamed Arab on an Algiers beach, was a true story. It might as well have been from the perspective of many Algerians; nationalist critics have long spoken about \u201cThe Stranger\u201d as if the murder it described had actually happened and Camus, whose opposition to independence was difficult for many Algerian writers to forgive, had committed it. Daoud\u2019s stroke of inspiration was to take the next step and make Meursault, the fictive murderer, the author of Camus\u2019s novel. Just as \u201cthe Arab\u201d is never named in \u201cThe Stranger,\u201d so the name of Camus is never mentioned in \u201cThe Meursault Investigation.\u201d\u201cMeursault\u201d is a confessional monologue, in the style of Camus\u2019s novel \u201cThe Fall,\u201d addressed by an Algerian named Harun to an unnamed Frenchman at a bar in Oran. Harun\u2019s brother, Musa, was murdered in 1942 by a French settler named Meursault, who went on to achieve fame by describing the killing in a novel called \u201cThe Other.\u201d Now an old man, Harun is determined to give his brother a name and a story and to correct Meursault\u2019s version of events. For the first half of the book, he does just that, settling an old account that Algerian nationalists \u2014 and postcolonial critics like Edward Said, who derided Camus\u2019s \u201cincapacitated colonial sensibility\u201d \u2014 have had with \u201cThe Stranger.\u201dBut the second half of Daoud\u2019s novel shows how little bearing that critique has on Algeria\u2019s present, denying the reader the easy satisfaction of anticolonial justice. Algeria, not Camus, is on trial here. Harun, we realize, is himself a stranger in a country overrun by religious fervor. The local mosque strikes him as so imposing \u201cit prevents you from seeing God\u201d; the man reciting the Quran sounds as if he were playing all of the roles, from \u201ctorturer to victim.\u201d Men wander around in crumpled pajamas and slippers \u201cas though Friday exempts them from the demands of civility.\u201d Friday is \u201cnot a day when God rested, it\u2019s a day when he decided to run away and never come back.\u201d\u201c\u2009\u2018The Stranger\u2019 is a philosophical novel, but we\u2019re incapable of reading it as anything other than a colonial novel,\u201d Daoud told me when I asked him what drew him to Camus\u2019s fiction. \u201cThe most profound question in Camus is religious: What do you do in relation to God if God doesn\u2019t exist? The most powerful scene in \u2018The Stranger\u2019 is the confrontation between the priest and the condemned man. Meursault is indifferent with women, with the judge, but he becomes choleric in the face of the priest. And here, in my novel, is someone revolting against God. Harun, for me, is a hero in a conservative society.\u201dThe most surprising attack on Daoud has come not from a jihadist but from a fellow breaker of taboos, the novelist Rachid Boudjedra, who fled Algeria under a similar threat from Islamists four decades ago. Boudjedra, who is also published by \u00c9ditions Barzakh, came to prominence in 1969 when he published, in French, \u201cThe Repudiation,\u201d about a young man whose father leaves his mother to marry a much younger woman. He avenges his mother\u2019s humiliation by sleeping with his stepmother; his gay brother kills himself after an affair with a Jewish man. Soaked in bodily fluids \u2014 blood, feces and semen \u2014 and filled with graphic depictions of sex and masturbation, \u201cThe Repudiation\u201d was an extreme act of literary rebellion. Shortly after the book was published, Boudjedra went into exile in Paris, then Morocco, for the next six years. He still keeps an apartment in Paris, and after a brief period of writing in Arabic, he has returned to writing in French. If anyone was in a position to understand Daoud\u2019s predicament, it was Boudjedra. Instead he ridiculed Daoud\u2019s novel as \u201cmediocre\u201d on Ennahar, the Arabic satellite channel that on that same day gave a platform to Hamadache. He later called Daoud one of \u201cthose writers who are trying to get a literary visa. They go to France and lick their boots.\u201dBoudjedra is a famously difficult man. But his disdain is not unique, and it reflects a more widespread class prejudice. Boudjedra, who fought in the War of Independence as a young man, is from a prominent rural family, while Daoud is a self-made man from a dusty village. One friend in the Algerian publishing business compares him to Rastignac, the parvenu who scales the social ladder in Balzac\u2019s \u201cHuman Comedy.\u201d For leftist intellectuals in Algiers, that alone makes Daoud a provincial hustler rather than a genuine intellectual.The day after I met Bey in Sidi Bel Abbes, I took the 8 a.m. train from Oran to Algiers, to visit some old friends, including the historian Daho Djerbal, whom I had first met here in 2003. Algiers felt very changed. Walking along Rue Didouche Mourad, the main commercial drag, I saw a city to which life, at least commercial life, had returned. I passed a Swatch shop, jewelry stores, travel agencies and fashion boutiques. The sidewalk cafes were full. At the Place de la Poste, hundreds of people, mostly men, were watching the Africa Cup on a giant outdoor television screen. I browsed in a lovely new bookstore, in the premises of a bookstore that had belonged to Joaquim Grau, a pied noir gunned down in 1994 by radical Islamists. The outdoor market that winds through Bab el Oued, a working-class neighborhood that was once an Islamist stronghold, was no less vibrant; the merchants\u2019 stalls were awash in Chinese electronic goods and clothing, CDs and DVDs and fresh produce.When I changed the subject to Kamel Daoud, Djerbal grew uncharacteristically impatient, as if I\u2019d asked him about someone beneath his pay grade. Daoud, he told me, was a part of the problem he had just described, a pampered child of the state he attacked. Surely, though, he had to admit that Daoud was a very good writer. Djerbal smiled. \u201cNot good enough for the Goncourt. Besides, France will never give the Goncourt to an Algerian.\u201d He seemed to be savoring Daoud\u2019s loss. Daoud, he continued, \u201crepresents a stratum without historical legitimacy.\u201dIn Algeria, the term \u201chistorical legitimacy\u201d is very specific. When the War of Independence broke out in 1954, the F.L.N. proclaimed its \u201chistorical legitimacy\u201d as the sole representative of the Algerian nation. To have legitimacy means that you represent a collective social force and therefore have the right to be heard. Most Algerian intellectuals set great store by legitimacy and by the implicit claim that they speak on behalf of a larger cause: the nation, the people, the working class, the Berbers. The fact that Daoud speaks only for himself may be what his critics find most unsettling about him.With a glass of wine in one hand and a cigarette in the other, she laid out the case for the prosecution. Daoud \u201cwrites as if imperialism and capitalism didn\u2019t exist.\u201d He was \u201cself-hating.\u201d It was \u201chardly a surprise that Kamel\u2019s narrator feels closer to the man who killed the Arab. You only have to read his columns.\u201d The novel was excellent, yet there was something \u201csuspicious\u201d about the book\u2019s success in France. \u201cI think it comforts white readers,\u201d she said.\u201cWhich country do you think was the first to want to translate Kamel\u2019s novel?\u201d Hadjadj interjected. \u201cVietnam.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn about whether the novel is translated in Vietnam,\u201d Mouffok said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about what French readers see in it.\u201dShe took a drag from her cigarette and paused. \u201cLook, I adore Kamel. He was luminous on \u2018We\u2019re Not Asleep.\u2019 He was beautiful, well spoken and sexy. A few days later I saw him on Echorouk television, and the guy interviewing talked to him as if he were an insect. I said to Kamel: \u2018Don\u2019t go on those shows, and don\u2019t behave as if you\u2019re guilty. Fight back. Algeria is a country that\u2019s failing, where you\u2019re not allowed to succeed and, if you do, people want you to fail. It\u2019s a hard country and it can be a brutal one.\u2019\u2009\u201dGrine, who is 60, is also a novelist who, like Daoud, writes in French. I told him that I enjoyed his novel \u201cCamus in the Hookah Lounge,\u201d about a man who hears a rumor that Camus is his biological father. He complained that his novel hadn\u2019t benefited from the \u201chuge promotion team\u201d that catapulted Daoud\u2019s book to success in France and hinted that his perspective on Camus might not have been welcome in Paris. The hero of \u201cCamus in the Hookah Lounge\u201d realizes that Camus was not his father and that Algerians have to abandon the fantasy of reclaiming Camus, as writers like Daoud and Bey have proposed.\u201cCamus wasn\u2019t an Algerian writer, he was a French writer,\u201d Grine said. \u201cHe was a colonizer of good will, a pied noir. Yes, he made gestures toward Algerians, but he was opposed to independence.\u201dGrine hadn\u2019t read \u201cMeursault.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s excellent.

{"Headline": "Big Companies Pay Later, Squeezing Their Suppliers", "Date": "2015-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow would you like to have 120 days to pay your creditors?Adopting a tactic widely used by 3G Capital, the Brazilian private investment group behind the recent merger of Heinz and Kraft Foods, a growing number of the world\u2019s largest food and packaged goods companies are asking their suppliers to give them as much as four months to pay their bills \u2014 even though they typically require payment from their own customers in 30 days.In the past, extended payment terms often were a signal that a company was experiencing worrisome cash flow problems, but these days big, robust companies are imposing new schedules on suppliers as a business strategy, analysts say.Bea Chiem, a credit analyst who follows food companies at Standard & Poor\u2019s, offered several reasons that companies might use the tactic: \u201cTheir recent performance has been soft, many are in the middle of restructuring and all are trying to balance the need for cash for their business and shareholder returns.\u201d\u201cExtending our payment terms allows us to better align with industry practice and ensures we compete on a level playing field, while simultaneously improving transparency and predictability of payment processes,\u201d Valerie Moens, a spokeswoman for Mondelez, maker of Cadbury chocolates, Honey Maid graham crackers and other brands, wrote in an email.Kris Charles, a Kellogg spokeswoman, wrote that the company started a new supply chain financing program last year, extending payments to 120 days. \u201cIt gives Kellogg and our suppliers more flexibility to manage our businesses effectively through better cash flow management,\u201d she said.The companies would not make executives available to speak about the matter, sending brief statements instead. And most suppliers would comment only without attribution, an illustration of the power imbalance with their big customers.\u201cEventually,\u201d said V. G. Narayanan, chief of the accounting practice unit at Harvard Business School, \u201cthe additional financing costs that suppliers incur because they aren\u2019t being paid promptly work their way back into higher prices for consumers.\u201dThe practice is often crippling for suppliers, especially smaller businesses that have little cushion. In Britain, the Marketing Agencies Association called on its member advertising agencies to \u201cstrike\u201d in April against Anheuser-Busch InBev, the beer behemoth created by an affiliate of 3G, after the company began seeking new terms. Those included acceptance of a payment period longer than 120 days and a request for pro bono work.Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP Group, the advertising titan, has warned that such practices could turn suppliers into lenders. \u201cI don\u2019t think our purpose is about banking \u2014 we\u2019re not a bank \u2014 or extended payment terms or agreeing to supply payment terms in low-interest conditions,\u201d he told Advertising Age in an interview shortly after Diageo moved to extend its payments to 90 days.Stephen Brock is surprised that a revolt against Anheuser-Busch InBev did not happen sooner. Mr. Brock, the owner of Supplied Industrial Solutions in Granite City, Ill., had provided valves, processing instrumentation and mechanical systems to Anheuser-Busch, maker of Budweiser and other beers.Anheuser-Busch was bought by an entity controlled by Jorge Paulo Lemann, Marcel Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira, also the principals behind 3G, and merged into InBev in 2008. A year later, Mr. Brock was told that he would no longer be paid for his goods in 30 days; rather, Anheuser-Busch InBev imposed a 120-day period.The beer giant represented about 5 percent of Mr. Brock\u2019s sales. He ultimately concluded he could better afford to lose the business than wait four months to be paid.\u201cThis really had a dreadful effect on our bottom line,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because it hit right in the middle of the recession, it took us about a year and a half to recoup those lost revenues.\u201dHe still does a small amount of business with Anheuser-Busch InBev. The company pays him using a credit card.\u201cBanks have tightened up lending, especially to small businesses like mine, so it becomes even harder to manage,\u201d Mr. Brock said. \u201cYou still have a payroll to make, your own suppliers to pay, electric and other utility bills \u2014 they can\u2019t wait four months for payment.\u201dThe spirits company is a signer of a voluntary agreement, the Prompt Payment Code, made by about 1,700 companies doing business in Britain after regulators threatened to take action against extended payment terms. The agreement holds those companies to 60-day payment terms, so when Diageo began asking suppliers for 90 days, the Forum of Private Business appealed to the group charged with its enforcement.Diageo now says it will pay its British suppliers in no more than 60 days.\u201cThe practice of implementing grossly unfair trading terms is a growing trend\u201d among some of Britain\u2019s best-known companies, one that \u201crisks breaking the backbone of the economy \u2014 small business,\u201d said Phil Orford, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business.So far, most of the pressure seems to fall on so-called ancillary suppliers, those providing companies with packaging, advertising, equipment and so forth. Diageo, for example, has asked for more extended terms from European suppliers of components for its manufacturing plants, but not from suppliers of sugar, an ingredient it cannot easily do without or readily find alternative providers for.That may be changing, though. Two major commodities houses, which supply raw materials like coffee, flour, sugar and cocoa to food companies, confirmed that many of their customers were demanding longer payment cycles.Irit Tamir, a senior adviser in the Oxfam America program aimed at ensuring that big global companies do not take advantage of small farmers and suppliers in the developing world, said she was concerned that such businesses, like Cargill, Bunge, the Noble Group and Archer Daniels Midland, were coming under pressure.\u201cThese things tend to make their way down the supply chain, and we know that the small farmers who produce palm oil, coffee, cocoa and the other commodities those companies need already have an inordinate amount of risk in their lives,\u201d Ms. Tamir said.Diane Shand, senior director of S.&P.\u2019s consumer products group, said companies asking for longer payment terms today often worked to help their suppliers shoulder the burden. Banks have developed \u201csupply chain finance\u201d practices that will arrange loans to a supplier on the same terms they offer that supplier\u2019s big customer, say, or buy a receivable at a slight discount so the supplier does not have to carry the receivable on its books.\u201cIt\u2019s more of a trade-off these big companies are offering,\u201d Ms. Shand said. \u201cThey may tell suppliers, O.K., now we\u2019ll pay you in 120 days instead of 60 or 90 but give you more business, or offer to pay in cash in five or seven days if the supplier will give them a small discount.\u201dBut outside the financial industry, few observers approve of the trend. \u201cI think the whole idea is very bad,\u201d Professor Narayanan of Harvard said. \u201cThey essentially are going to their suppliers for credit, rather than their banks \u2014 and for big, creditworthy companies like these, that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dProfessor Narayanan said that major retailers had begun extending payments to their vendors some time ago, which in turn encouraged those vendors to put the squeeze on their suppliers. More recently, he said, Wall Street has gotten into the act, pushing companies to extend terms because their competitors are.Investment analysts \u201ccompare one manufacturer to another and say, \u2018How come you\u2019re not managing your working capital the way that other company is?\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes a matter of benchmarking, so if one company does it, then other firms fall in line.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wisconsin Has Avoided Arms Race in Recruiting", "Date": "2015-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn College BasketballINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 On Monday night, Wisconsin will face a team with at least eight former McDonald\u2019s all-Americans for the second consecutive game.Asked how Wisconsin, which has zero former McDonald\u2019s all-Americans, might beat Duke in the N.C.A.A. tournament final, as it did Kentucky in a semifinal, guard Josh Gasser referred to his fellow starter Bronson Koenig.\u201cBronson sent out a tweet a little while ago that said we have seven Wisconsin All-Stars and they don\u2019t have any of those,\u201d Gasser told reporters Sunday.It was a joke that also told the truth. Wisconsin\u2019s success under Coach Bo Ryan \u2014 including appearances in the Final Four the last two years and a .742 winning percentage over 14 seasons since his arrival in 2001 \u2014 has occurred precisely because Ryan has focused on attracting less-heralded local talent as opposed to the nationally recognized players that the other top programs chase.What makes this remarkable and \u2014 to borrow Gasser\u2019s point \u2014 a bit funny is that Ryan does not seem to have devised his strategy as a response to trends in college basketball. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s deliberate,\u201d said Pat Richter, the former Wisconsin athletic director who hired Ryan. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way he\u2019s always done it.\u201dThe most obvious way to build the best college basketball team is to recruit the best players, at which Kentucky Coach John Calipari excels. If five current Wildcats are drafted into the N.B.A. in the first round in June, no informed observer will bat an eye. Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski is not quite the recruiter Calipari is, but Duke boasts three freshmen who play significant minutes, two of whom will be high draft picks.National recruiting is a winner-takes-all economy, though.In an interview last month, no less than John Wall \u2014 the star guard for the Washington Wizards who, as a highly regarded prospect out of high school, played for Calipari at Kentucky for one season \u2014 said the increased prevalence of so-called one-and-dones had damaged parity.\u201cMy year, you had a lot of teams that would dominate,\u201d he said, referring to the 2009-10 season. \u201cNow you have one dominant team a year, and a couple of others that are just O.K. It\u2019s not the same as it used to be, in my opinion. A lot of guys were not doing one-and-done as much when I came in.\u201dBut Wisconsin does not participate in the chase.In Gasser, Wisconsin starts a fifth-year senior. Frank Kaminsky, winner of the Associated Press Player of the Year award, is a senior who steadily improved each year. The star forward Sam Dekker is a junior.Ryan does not run a charity for scrappy, underappreciated players. He wants the best players for his system, but his system favors a certain kind of player: He must be able to play all five positions on offense, or be willing to learn; on defense, he must limit fouls; and he must work on free-throw shooting and fundamentals. In practice, this means players who very likely will stay a few years to develop. These are players with chips on their shoulders. Players who are willing to adapt.It means, in other words, that Ryan is usually not chasing the prospects whom Calipari, Krzyzewski and many other top coaches are.Ryan\u2019s ability to step back from the recruiting arms race and shape recruiting around his program also has the merit of reinforcing his system \u2014 the swing offense, his man-to-man defenses \u2014 which works because everyone understands that it is bigger than any one player. Otto Puls, 82, the Badgers\u2019 official scorekeeper for 51 years, and Ron Rainey, 79, Ryan\u2019s coach at Chester High School and Wilkes University, were hanging around the locker room Sunday, as if reminding the players that they are part of something much larger and durable.When a reporter suggested that Rainey coached Ryan, who is 67, as many as 40 years ago, Dekker corrected him: \u201c50.\u201dDekker elaborated on what the system means to the team.\u201cHe\u2019s not going to change for one person or one group of people,\u201d Dekker said of Ryan. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make you buy into it.\u201dThe assistant coach Greg Gard added that the continuity of Ryan\u2019s system \u2014 which Gard first learned when he attended Ryan\u2019s summer basketball camps in tiny Platteville in the 1980s \u2014 was \u201chuge.\u201d \u201cWe understand the culture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand the philosophy, and we understand what works at Wisconsin.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Central Europe Really Thinks About Russia", "Date": "2015-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSOFIA, Bulgaria \u2014 It was only a decade ago that Central Europe, in the American imagination, was Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s \u201cNew Europe,\u201d a collection of freedom-loving, heroic small nations \u2014 and America\u2019s most loyal allies. Washington ushered them into NATO as a bulwark against Middle Eastern instability and Russian expansionism. Today, however, that perception has changed. Many fear that a number of these plucky, strategically vital states have become Moscow\u2019s Trojan horses in the Western alliances. The willingness of the Czech president, Milos Zeman, to attend the military parade in Moscow this spring marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany \u2014 an event boycotted by Western heads of state \u2014 was widely read as a symbolic break with Central Europe\u2019s Western orientation. (After intense pressure, Mr. Zeman withdrew from attending the parade but not from the trip itself.) Meanwhile, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, has signaled that his government would block the proposed establishment of a European energy union, a core part of Brussels\u2019 strategy to reduce Russia\u2019s influence in the region. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that several Central European governments are using the current crisis in the West\u2019s relations with Russia as an opportunity to get better economic deals from Moscow, criticizing anti-Russian sanctions for better gas prices and investments.So, has Moscow succeeded in splitting Central Europe into pro-Russian and anti-Russian camps? And can the European Union\u2019s current consensus on Russia \u2014 and the Union itself \u2014 survive the next few years under such strain? To answer these questions, political pundits must jettison the clich\u00e9s that have shaped Western views on Central Europe these last few decades. The behavior of Central European governments and societies are shaped by their experiences of the post-Communist transition and their rediscovered sense of national interest, and not by the memories of the Communist period. Geography and economic interests beat historical memories. Central Europeans are economically more closely tied to Russia than the rest of the Union; because of that, they pay far higher costs for the sanctions regime. It is also not a secret that Russian money has infiltrated parts of the business and political elites in the post-Communist countries. But what the Central European \u201cstreet\u201d really thinks about the current crisis is a question rarely asked, though one that it is absolutely vital to answer. Take public opinion in two Central European countries with historically contrasting views on Russia: Poland and Bulgaria. Poland is a medium-sized European country that rightly believes that it has dramatically benefited from the collapse of Communism and that its voice matters in the European Union. Poles have been traditionally mistrustful of Russia\u2019s ambitions. They judge the regime of President Vladimir V. Putin as ugly and brutal. A survey conducted last month by the Institute for Public Affairs in Warsaw found that Poles view the crisis in Ukraine as a direct threat to their security.Bulgaria is likewise a member of NATO and the Union, but its post-Cold War experience has been far more problematic than Poland\u2019s: It can be judged as anything but a success. And given the country\u2019s relative proximity to the Middle East, it\u2019s no surprise that a majority of Bulgarians have a greater fear of Turkish hegemony and so-called radical Islam than of Russian aggression.According to a poll by Alpha Research taken around the same time as the Institute for Public Affairs survey, a majority of Bulgarians do not perceive the war in Ukraine as a major threat, and the annexation of Crimea has hardly altered their generally positive view of Moscow. In fact, Bulgarians tend to blame America rather than Russia for the crisis in Ukraine.Here\u2019s where it gets interesting, though. Despite Polish concerns over Russia, the majority of Poles oppose weapons deliveries to Ukraine, and an even larger majority are reluctant to let Ukrainians travel freely in the European Union. Confronted with the stark choice between Russia and the West, the vast majority of Bulgarians opt for the West, and more than 70 percent find the Brussels-centered foreign policy of their government to be \u201cbalanced and reasonable.\u201dWhat explains this disconnect? Why are pro-Russian Bulgarians ready to follow Brussels and anti-Russian Poles not ready to follow Washington? The answer may be less counterintuitive than we imagine. Poles have understandable doubts about the security guarantees proffered by NATO and the European Union that are rooted in their troubled history with Western security guarantees and their obvious fear of facing the Russian threat alone. They were also burned by their support for America\u2019s war in Iraq. And while Bulgarians sympathize with Russians, it is precisely because of their familiarity with Moscow\u2019s ways that they do not consider the Putin regime as a model to be followed. Bulgarians share much of the conventional Russian resentment of the West. They have no enthusiasm for the politics of sanctions; they suffered indirectly from the Western sanctions imposed on their neighbor, Yugoslavia, two decades ago, and they rightly suspect that Russia\u2019s confrontation with the West will not only hurt their economy but also will polarize domestic politics. But they also know that small nations on the periphery of the old Continent will be the biggest losers if Russia succeeds in its efforts to break up the European Union. Russia may be resurgent, but Mr. Putin\u2019s regime is corrupt and repressive. We shouldn\u2019t probably extrapolate too much from looking at just two Central European societies. And yet both Poles and Bulgarians share a similar core sensibility: that the West may not be fully trustworthy, but Moscow offers no viable alternative. So though the crisis in Ukraine would hardly bring Europe and America closer together, Moscow\u2019s attempt to split the European Union is likely to fail. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Fix the Mess in Venezuela", "Date": "2015-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLIMA, Peru \u2014 The recent news from Venezuela has been troubling \u2014 and also far from surprising. As the Venezuelan economy continues to struggle and inflation pushes many of the most basic everyday needs out of reach of ordinary working people, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has responded, not with a plan, but with a crackdown. It has included arresting Antonio Ledezma, the mayor of Caracas, and other opposition figures on questionable charges \u2014 to say nothing of the jailings of peaceful protesters.Mr. Maduro\u2019s attempts to deflect criticism by pointing to aggression from the United States and international meddling \u2014 even if they were rooted in fact \u2014 would do nothing to solve Venezuela\u2019s problems. If he were a serious leader, he would look first at the Venezuelan economy, which, in reality, is at least two economies, separate and far from equal. Despite its reputation for redistribution, Venezuela has seen rising inequality. Even as ordinary Venezuelans have seen their purchasing power shrink in the face of rapidly rising inflation, the elite has relied on the growing strength of its access to dollars, a dichotomy that throws Venezuela\u2019s ever more unequal economy into sharp relief.Venezuela\u2019s economic problems extend beyond inequality and poverty. Over the long term, Venezuela must follow the lead of other Latin American nations and reorient its economy away from dependence on the volatile oil export market. It must develop its other resources and capacities across a broad spectrum of more labor-intensive industries like manufacturing or agricultural processing. But that long-term problem is no reason not to attempt to tackle inequality today. The tools for doing so vary in complexity and difficulty, but they offer an array of approaches for a government committed to the issue.One crucial tool is the combination of tax collection and fiscal policy. Improved tax collection raises revenues without raising rates, and those revenues enable investments in health care, early childhood education, primary and secondary education, job training and agricultural education programs that offer the poor a chance to improve their lives.Another tool is direct support, which often takes the form of increases in funding and improvements in the reach of traditional, long-established programs like pensions for the elderly and unemployment insurance. But newer, more innovative approaches also show great promise. One is conditional cash transfers: payments made directly to poor families so long as they meet certain conditions, such as keeping their teenage children in school. While I was president of Peru, we had particular success with conditional cash transfers (known there as Juntos). A World Bank study credited Juntos with a 5 percent cut in the poverty gap in just a few years, and showed positive ancillary effects as well, including increased food consumption and more reliable use of health care services by young children and pregnant mothers.Through these and other interventions, Latin American governments in recent years have shown that fighting inequality is possible. Between 2000 and 2011, the percentage of people living below the poverty line in Latin America was slashed to 29 percent from 42 percent, while those in extreme poverty fell to 11.5 percent from 18 percent. Ameliorating inequality isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s an essential way to help ease the political turmoil during tough economic times.Fixing the economy, however, is only one of the tasks facing Mr. Maduro. The second is going to be tougher: He must shed the conspiratorial mind-set and authoritarian instincts he has carried over from the regime of his predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and accept that true democracy includes dissent, and that means he won\u2019t always get his way. Freeing the jailed opposition leaders is the first step; acknowledging that the protesters have valid concerns and a right to express them a necessary second. Sadly, we have seen no sign that Mr. Maduro understands that, or that he is willing to change. Until he does, the international community must keep up external pressure to match the internal pressure being generated in the streets.The reality is that fighting against inequality and fighting for democracy go hand in hand. When gains are more widely shared, the economy isn\u2019t the only beneficiary: Democracy gets a boost, too. Democratic societies that are more economically equal tend to be notably deeper democracies, with broader participation and more widely shared power and decision making.Improvements in one area can have salutary effects in another. As people feel that their labor is being rewarded, and that the fruits of success are more widely shared, they are more inclined to view themselves as citizens, with rights and responsibilities. Similarly, when people feel that the rule of law is strong, and that democracy is sound, they are more likely to make the investments of both capital and labor that are the foundations of long-term economic growth.The road forward for Venezuela, as for many other nations facing similar problems, won\u2019t be easy, and change won\u2019t come overnight. But arrests and denial are unquestionably not the answer. Venezuela, Latin America and the world deserve better.Advertisement"}

The platform\u2019s chief function is to separate gas and oil before it is pumped to onshore refineries.In a statement, Mexico\u2019s state-run oil company, Pemex, which owns the huge oil rig, said that there was no evidence of a major spill, but that the blast had forced the evacuation of more than 300 workers from the rig in seas off the southern state of Tabasco.The platform is part of the Abkatun-Pol-Chuc offshore field, which produced 300,000 barrels per day in 2013.Reports of the explosion came as Pemex, like oil companies and oil-producing states all over the world, has been forced to adjust to the global plunge in petroleum prices. At the same time, Pemex has been trying to lure foreign investment as part of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s effort to bolster the country\u2019s economy through the development of new oil and gas fields.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto sent his condolences to the families of the four dead workers and issued orders to conduct a \u201cthorough and appropriate investigation\u201d to establish responsibility and \u201cavoid this type of accident in the future.\u201d An employee of a Pemex contractor who escaped the burning platform in a boat said he had witnessed other workers jumping into the sea \u201cout of desperation and panic,\u201d the local news media reported.The injured workers, two of them in serious condition, were being treated in a nearby hospital at Ciudad del Carmen.Despite the assurances that the fire had not caused a significant spill, environmental organizations issued statements expressing concern. Mexico\u2019s worst oil spill in the Gulf was in 1979, when an explosion of an offshore rig leaked 140 million gallons of oil over nine months.Advertisement"}

Mr. Putin responded to roughly 70, and about half of them focused on the state of the economy.Mr. Putin said he had not heard that trucks trying to get onto the single ferry to Crimea often waited in line for two weeks. (It was notable that the first mention of Crimea, annexed by Russia from Ukraine last year, came about three hours and 40 minutes into the program.)When a weeping woman was interviewed from an area of Siberia devastated by wildfires this week, Mr. Putin spontaneously promised thousands of dollars to every family who had lost a loved one or property.Foreign policy issues did enter into the discussion, but the first question did not come until an hour into the program. And Mr. Putin repeated many of Russia\u2019s earlier positions.Although Ukraine was failing to fulfill the Minsk cease-fire agreements when it came to constitutional reform and financial support for the separatist regions, Russia would stick with the accord, he said. There are no Russian troops fighting in Ukraine now, he said, and there will be no war along Russia\u2019s southwestern border.Mr. Putin took several pot shots at the United States, blaming it for the rise of the Islamic State, for example, through the destabilization of Iraq after the American-orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein. And he accused Washington of pressuring world leaders into skipping Moscow\u2019s celebration of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe.Mr. Putin has two main public personas. There is the angry Putin who sometimes seems to sneer at the world and makes speeches like one exhorting security officers to stamp out internal threats. Then there is the \u201cgood,\u201d avuncular Putin who was on display Thursday, giving mostly moderate answers to all manner of questions.In the fall, Mr. Putin suggested that to protect Russian speakers, Moscow would seize back territory in neighboring states \u2014 notably areas in southeastern Ukraine first seized by Catherine the Great. On Thursday, he took virtually the opposite tack.\u201cWe have no imperial ambitions,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we can ensure a decent life to the people, including Russians, living abroad, in the neighboring countries of the former Soviet Union, by developing collaboration and cooperation.\u201dMr. Putin said he saw no reason for the city of Moscow to keep removing all the flowers and flags citizens were placing on the bridge where the opposition politician Boris Y. Nemtsov was assassinated in February, and said he would have a word with Moscow\u2019s mayor about it.While Mr. Putin was speaking, however, a different face of Russia was on display in the capital. At a security conference across town, senior members of the military said Russia wanted global cooperation on issues like combating terrorism, but would not stand idly by as NATO expanded eastward.And security officers raided the Moscow headquarters of Open Russia, an organization funded by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the jailed oil oligarch turned political exile.This year\u2019s studio audience was notable in that many of those called upon were often critical of Mr. Putin, and one television host, Kirill Kleymenov, asked tough questions.But when topics seemed too closely linked to the president, he threw them right back at the questioner. At one point, Mr. Kleymenov suggested that Mr. Putin\u2019s main economic policy seemed to be waiting for the price of oil to recover, a question Mr. Putin called \u201coverly critical.\u201dMr. Putin evoked the hated 1990s government economists who, in the view of many Russians, pursued a misguided policy of capitalist shock therapy that ushered in a decade of instability and poverty. Russians revile them, and Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity in his third term as president rests in no small part on the fact that until last fall, the economy was stable and wages increased steadily along with the price of oil for much of the past 15 years.\u201cIn order to build up economic policy competently, of course, you need a brain,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cBut if we want people to trust us, we also need a heart and need to feel how an ordinary man lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Yasushi Inoue has never enjoyed such international popularity, but his enormous oeuvre \u2014 begun in midcentury and only in midlife, after a \u00adsuccessful career as a newspaperman \u2014 made him one of the most celebrated authors in \u00adJapan by the time of his death in 1991. Two graceful new translations, the first published last fall and the second last month, should help expand his audience in English.Inoue\u2019s 1949 novella \u201cThe Hunting Gun\u201d remains perhaps his best-known work outside Japan. Here three women speak in three letters addressed to the same man, the coolly self-assured \u00adMisugi \u2014 Shoko, his bewildered young niece; Midori, his defiant wife; and Saiko, his longtime lover, on the brink of suicide. As the women react to the revelation of illicit love, their perspectives are layered one atop another like the colors in a woodblock print. To be human, Inoue suggests, is to be alone. Bereaved Shoko, daughter of the now dead Saiko, has only just learned of her mother and uncle\u2019s secret sin; the betrayed Midori, meanwhile, has concealed her own awareness of the affair for the length of her marriage, despite the fact that Saiko was her dearest friend. For all three women, unmediated emotional connection is impossible, perhaps even undesirable. As for Misugi, he imagines a small snake twisting invisibly at the center of every soul, a writhing embodiment of ego or pity or fear. Saiko flinches from the image even as she clings to it.In an elaborate framing device, the doomed affair comes to the attention of a stranger: Having recognized himself in a poem (\u201cThe Hunting Gun\u201d) published in a magazine, Misugi has sent the poet all three letters. \u201cWe humans are, in the end, stupid creatures who cannot help desiring that someone know us as we are,\u201d Misugi writes, entrusting the greatest intimacies of his life to a man he has never met.In Inoue\u2019s fiction, what sometimes bridges these terrible gaps between individuals is art: a strangely consoling verse, an evocative painting, a fragment of calligraphy. Two men, connoisseurs examining a scroll together in \u201cLife of a Counterfeiter,\u201d experience a flash of \u00adcommunion: \u201cOur gazes unexpectedly collided, and clung together for a \u00admoment.\u201d The creation of beauty is the highest achievement. The forger of that story\u2019s title, a frustrated artist, is best \u00adremembered after his death for creating an extraordinary display of fireworks. Once the last shell has exploded, he looks up from his frantic efforts, exhausted, and asks: \u201cHow was it? Was it beautiful?\u201dThe two shorter stories that are \u00adcollected with \u201cLife of a \u00adCounterfeiter,\u201d called \u201cReeds\u201d and \u201cMr. Goodall\u2019s Gloves,\u201d belong to the thinly veiled \u00adautobiographical mode that first became \u00adpopular among Japanese writers in the late 19th century. Largely indistinguishable from memoir, these sketches \u00adexamine moments from Inoue\u2019s past, lingering on his confusion and isolation, and brooding over the \u201cfiercely sacred\u201d persistence of memory. Sent to live with a \u201cgrandmother,\u201d a \u00adformer geisha who had been his great-grandfather\u2019s concubine, Inoue experienced a childhood full of troubling gaps and unexplained tensions, all of which later fueled his fiction. Inoue writes with the economy of a poet, though allusions intended to resonate eloquently with Japanese readers can be obscure in English. His stories are steeped in ambiguity and the melancholy piquancy of pain, informed by the Buddhist teaching that passion and suffering are inextricably entwined. \u201cTo love, to be loved \u2014 how sad such human doings are,\u201d Saiko writes as she ends her letter, and her life. These elegant new editions of Inoue\u2019s work are in keeping with his masterfully understated prose. They are best read quietly, the better to hear what is left unsaid.THE HUNTING GUNBy Yasushi InoueTranslated by Michael Emmerich111 pp. Pushkin Press.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Not the Inequality; It\u2019s the Immobility", "Date": "2015-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIncome inequality and economic immobility are often lumped together, but they shouldn\u2019t be. Consider the two concepts positively: Income equality is about bridging the gap between the rich and the poor, while economic mobility is about elevating the poor as rapidly as possible. Finding ways to increase economic mobility should be our greater concern.For instance, while we have talked incessantly about the disproportionate gains of the top 1 percent, the wage slowdown in the United States in recent decades is a bigger problem for most people. Since 1973, for workers as a whole, wages have stagnated largely because of a severe productivity slowdown.Those changes in productivity and inequality trends aren\u2019t entirely separate, but accelerating the growth of productivity has the potential to do more for upward economic mobility than redistributing money from the top 1 percent. To be sure, we need to retain the concept of inequality in our thinking, if only to understand public perceptions of the economy or how pay structures are evolving inside corporations. Still, we should be cautious in using \u201cinequality\u201d as an automatically negative term. A lot of inequality is natural and indeed desirable, because individuals have different talents and tastes and opportunities can never be fully equalized. The concept of mobility helps us distinguish between \u201cgood inequality\u201d and \u201cbad inequality.\u201d Reductions in inequality can follow from a leveling in either direction \u2014 by elevating the poor or pushing down the wealthy. It is the plight of the poor that we most need to improve.In the book \u201cEquality for Inegalitarians,\u201d George Sher, a professor of philosophy at Rice University, argues that the equality we should care most about is giving everyone a chance to \u201clive effectively.\u201d Most of all that means ensuring that people have enough for their daily needs. We can tolerate many of the inequalities that arise above this minimum income level, provided there is protection on the downside and plenty of opportunities for those who are economically ambitious. To see how a perspective dominated by mobility differs from one focusing on inequality, consider the licensing of occupations like interior decorators and barbers. This licensing, which covers an increasing part of the American labor market, limits economic opportunities for many lower earners and thus hinders mobility. But if we relax licensing for a particular sector, that will most likely create some wealthy people, and also some business losers, and it is quite possible that measured income inequality will rise. That may not register as a net gain according to the formal metrics of the egalitarian, but there is more opportunity, and greater liberty to earn a living as one sees fit. The inequality focus tends to draw us to redistribution, whereas a mobility focus is more conducive to ideas for wealth creation.In personal discussions, I\u2019ve found that egalitarians often retreat to pro-mobility intuitions when confronted by such examples, because who wants to oppose greater opportunity? Still, the key is to be consistent, and that means acknowledging that widely used gauges of economic inequality, like the Gini coefficient, aren\u2019t well suited for measuring social and economic progress. That metric and similar ones don\u2019t focus our attention on what is actually unfair about the status quo: the absolute deprivation and lack of opportunity imposed on too many people. Furthermore, actual mobility has been much more robust than the numbers indicate. The statistics do not count the gains of people who have come from another country for a new and higher salary in the United States. The percentage of foreign-born Americans has been rising for decades and that suggests significant unmeasured mobility gains.It is quite possible the future will bring higher levels of income inequality, which will undoubtedly distress many commentators. But we are likely to be better off if we keep our eye on the ball, identify what really helps people the most and do whatever we can to increase economic mobility. That is a practical program that we all should be able to endorse. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tensions Flare Between Iraq and Saudi Arabia in U.S. Coalition", "Date": "2015-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States remains caught in a difficult balancing act as it tries to keep the Saudi air campaign in Yemen on track against Iranian-backed Houthis. But in its fight against the Islamic State in Iraq, the Obama administration finds itself supporting an Iraqi military offensive that is also backed by Iran.The dueling Iraqi and Saudi narratives began when Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq, who this week is making his first official visit to Washington, spoke early in the day to a small group of reporters at Blair House, the White House guest residence for visiting dignitaries. He said the Saudi campaign and the fighting in Yemen had created huge humanitarian problems.\u201cThere is no logic to the operation at all in the first place,\u201d Mr. Abadi said. \u201cMainly, the problem of Yemen is within Yemen.\u201dMr. Abadi, who is in Washington seeking American military help in the fight against the Islamic State as well as billions of dollars to shore up his sagging economy, then suggested that the Obama administration agreed with him in his concerns about the Saudi campaign.\u201cThey want to stop this conflict as soon as possible,\u201d Mr. Abadi said. \u201cWhat I understand from the administration, the Saudis are not helpful on this. They don\u2019t want a cease-fire now.\u201dThe administration swiftly denied that President Obama had expressed concern about the Saudi air campaign during a meeting with Mr. Abadi on Tuesday at the White House.\u201cThe president did not criticize Saudi or G.C.C. actions in Yemen,\u201d said Alistair Baskey, a spokesman for the National Security Council, referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council. At the same time, Mr. Baskey said, Mr. Obama had conveyed his view to the Iraqi prime minister \u201cthat this not escalate into a broader conflict and that ultimately Yemen\u2019s conflict can only be settled through a political negotiation.\u201dAnnotated maps showing the Houthi rebels\u2019 drive south, U.S. airstrikes and historical divisions.In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Abadi also said he was worried that Saudi airstrikes might be a precursor for a more assertive Saudi military role in neighboring states.\u201cThe dangerous thing is we don\u2019t know what the Saudis want to do after this,\u201d Mr. Abadi said. \u201cIs Iraq within their radar? That\u2019s very, very dangerous. The idea that you intervene in another state unprovoked just for regional ambition is wrong. Saddam has done it before. See what it has done to the country.\u201dA few hours later, Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, held a news conference at the Saudi Embassy and made his remarks about Mr. Abadi in response to questions from reporters, some of whom had met with Mr. Abadi at Blair House.In addition to saying that there was \u201cno logic\u201d to Mr. Abadi\u2019s remarks, Mr. Jubeir set forth a highly positive picture of the Saudi campaign in Yemen. He said that the bombing had destroyed attack planes, helicopters, ballistic missiles, air defenses and command elements. But he gave no precise figures.Saudi officials have insisted that their airstrikes, which they named Operation Decisive Storm, have been effective in weakening the Houthi forces.Mr. Jubeir rejected as \u201cfalse\u201d reports that Saudi bombers had accidentally killed numerous civilians in some of their airstrikes, and said Saudi Arabia had taken measures to minimize risks to Yemeni civilians.The air campaign has also created fissures among the Houthis and loyalists to the former Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. Mr. Jubeir said the bombing had prompted some senior Yemeni officers \u2014 he did not say how many \u2014 to abandon Mr. Saleh.\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to see cracks in their leadership,\u201d Mr. Jubeir said.The ambassador dismissed Mr. Abadi\u2019s claim that United States officials were worried about the goals and conduct of the air campaign, saying that no American official had complained to him about it.Under the arrangement, Saudi Arabia gives lists of potential targets to the American analysts for vetting. \u201cWe are not choosing their targets, but upon request, we\u2019re providing intelligence to help Saudi Arabia with their precision, effectiveness and avoidance of collateral damage,\u201d the official said.Efforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State.In other comments to reporters, Mr. Abadi played down Iran\u2019s role in military operations in his own country \u2014 he said that Iran had only 110 military advisers in Iraq, far fewer than American military estimates. And he said that Iran\u2019s role was understandable because some of the Islamic State attacks in Iraq were near Iran.James F. Jeffrey, a former United States ambassador to Baghdad, said that Mr. Abadi\u2019s remarks reflected deep-seated Iraqi concerns that sectarian tensions in the region might escalate further with devastating consequences for Iraq.\u201cThe underlying fear in the whole Middle East given the weak state system in most countries is this three-way tug of war between Iran, Sunni Arab states and the Sunni Islamist militant movements,\u201d Mr. Jeffrey said. \u201cThe Iraqis are openly angry with the Saudis and they are almost certainly quietly unhappy with the Iranians,\u201d he added. \u201cThey would be the first victims of a Sunni-Shia cataclysm and don\u2019t want to be a bigger version of Lebanon.\u201dLater on Wednesday, Iraq\u2019s oil minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, told reporters that the Islamic State had seized control of some of the towers surrounding the Baiji oil refinery in northern Iraq last Friday and had infiltrated part of the complex. The Islamic State militants, he said, are trying to mount a counterattack after their recent loss of the city of Tikrit. Mr. Mahdi said he was confident that the militants would eventually be defeated.Also on Wednesday, Iraq\u2019s finance minister, Hoshyar Zebari, said that Iraq is planning to issue $5 billion in bonds to try to cover a large budget deficit, which he said was about $25 billion for 2015. Iraqi officials have been negotiating with Citibank and Deutsche Bank, which would underwrite the bonds.Iraq is also hoping to receive about $400 million to $700 million from the International Monetary Fund, though the fund has been insisting that the country do more to cut public spending as a condition of receiving the funds, Mr. Zebari said. Iraq is also hoping to work out an arrangement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States to finance the purchase of Boeing commercial aircraft, which would provide Iraq with $500 million in short-term funds.It has taken other steps to try to ease its budget squeeze, including deferring $4.2 billion in reparations to Kuwait for Saddam Hussein\u2019s 1990 invasion of the country.Mr. Abadi said that the next step in military operations against Islamic State fighters was to try to roll them back in Iraq\u2019s western Anbar Province and north of Baghdad, toward the oil refinery at Baiji. A military push to retake the northern city of Mosul, he said, would not occur until after Ramadan, which ends in mid-July.On Wednesday, the Islamic State launched a major offensive in Anbar, and by the end of the day, it had captured three villages on the outskirts of Ramadi, the provincial capital, officials said.During the fighting, hundreds of people from the besieged villages fled their homes, many ending up in Ramadi. State television reported Wednesday that the Islamic State was burning homes and massacring civilians in the areas it had seized, although those reports could not be independently verified.Anbar officials said that the army had fled the villages that were under attack, leaving tribal fighters and the local police, who they said were badly outgunned by the militants, to defend the areas. In recent days the American-led coalition struck several Islamic State targets near Ramadi, according to a Pentagon statement.Tim Arango contributed reporting from Baghdad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Has Obamacare Turned Voters Against Sharing the Wealth?", "Date": "2015-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith the advent of the Affordable Care Act, the share of Americans convinced that health care is a right shrank from a majority to a minority.If the court rules against the A.C.A., public and private health care delivery would be disrupted, to put it mildly. Congressional Republicans are already working on replacement proposals that would, among other things, limit coverage for the poor.With the loss of healthier customers, insurance companies would be forced to raise premiums for their remaining clientele by 35 percent, from an annual average of $4,130 to $5,590, according to the institute\u2019s study.As Republicans put together legislative alternatives to address the health care crisis that could result from a Supreme Court ruling against Obamacare, they are looking to public opinion surveys to determine the range of options that would have public support.The Kaiser survey found strong opposition, 64-35, to the individual mandate requiring that everyone purchase health coverage. In contrast, a majority of respondents, 60-38, supported the employer mandate that requires companies with 100 or more workers to provide health insurance.An earlier New York Times poll, conducted in December 2013, found that 52 percent of those surveyed believed that the Affordable Care Act would increase their medical costs; 14 percent said it would reduce costs. Thirty-six percent believed that Obamacare would worsen the quality of health care compared to 17 percent who thought it would improve it.On the plus side for the Affordable Care Act, those surveyed by the Times decisively supported, 86-10, the requirement that insurance companies cover people with pre-existing conditions; the requirement to cover children in parents\u2019 plans up to age 26 was supported 70-28; and 76 percent supported providing some help to poor workers who do not have employer-based coverage.Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, answering my email, wrote that the tax credits in the Republican plans \u201ctend to be quite a bit less generous\u201d than under Obamacare, and that \u201clow-income people, in particular, were likely to end up with very skimpy insurance\u201d and fewer low-income people would be covered under the program.The conservative shift in public attitudes on health care and on issues of redistribution and inequality pose a significant threat to the larger liberal agenda.The author of the paper, Matthew Luttig, a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University of Minnesota, found that while \u201cnumerous political theorists suggest that rising inequality and the shift in the distribution of income to those at the top should lead to increasing support for liberal policies,\u201d in practice, \u201crising inequality in the United States has largely promoted ideological conservatism.\u201dLuttig compares public attitudes with inequality trends and reports that his data show that:Both the absolute level and the changing structure of inequality have largely been a force promoting conservatism, not increasing support for redistribution as theoretically expected.Insofar as Luttig is right, his findings pose a serious dilemma for Democrats and for their likely nominee, Hillary Clinton. A party that claims to pursue policies benefiting those on the bottom half of the income ladder inevitably faces questions about the issue of redistribution.But this kind of evasiveness can\u2019t last. Neither core Democratic constituencies on the left nor Republicans on the right will permit Clinton to remain guarded on these divisive issues. If conservative beliefs are strengthening in direct proportion to increasing inequality, however, Democrats are caught in a policy bind that has no short-term solution.\u201cThe General Social Survey shows there has been a slight decrease in stated support for redistribution in the US since the 1970s, even among those who self-identify as having below-average income,\u201d according to Saez and his three co-authors, Ilyana Kuziemko, a professor at Columbia Business School, Michael I. Norton, a professor at Harvard Business School, and Stefanie Stantcheva, a junior fellow at Harvard.Even worse for Democrats, the Saez paper found that \u201cinformation about inequality also makes respondents trust government less,\u201d decreasing \u201cby nearly twenty percent the share of respondents who \u2018trust government\u2019 most of the time:\u201dHence, emphasizing the severity of a social or economic problem appears to undercut respondents\u2019 willingness to trust the government to fix it \u2014 the existence of the problem could act as evidence of the government\u2019s limited capacity to improve outcomes.The findings of the Saez group are consistent with Luttig\u2019s. Taken together, they suggest that even if Democrats win the presidency and the Senate in 2016, largely on the basis of favorable demographic trends, the party will confront serious hurdles if it attempts to deliver material support to working men and women and the very poor. Redistribution is in trouble, and that is likely to tie American politics in knots for many years to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make Sense of Weak Economic Growth in 2015", "Date": "2015-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsAnother year, another winter slump.The real test for the economy is whether the first quarter will, as was the case last year, turn out to be an aberration, with a catch-up effect happening in the form of apparently strong growth in the spring and summer months. In 2014, a 2.1 percent annual rate of contraction in the first quarter was counterbalanced by an average 4.8 percent growth in the second and third quarter, making for a quite solid year over all.So economy-watchers \u2014 whether it is the officials at the Federal Reserve trying to decide when the coast is clear to raise interest rates, businesses trying to weigh expansion plans, or families trying to decide whether it makes sense to buy a house \u2014 are going to have to look elsewhere to figure out whether the economic expansion, six years in, is finally becoming more robust.The other data we have available is also sending mixed signals. Job growth has been vigorous for months, but the latest report showed softening in March. April data is due May 8. Various surveys of industrial activity and retail sales have shown a similar picture of weak activity, though that too is hard to disentangle from the effects of uncommonly bad weather (in other words, were retail sales negative in the first months of 2015 because of underlying weakness, or because people just didn\u2019t want to go to shopping centers or car dealerships in often brutally cold weather?).Even if the top-line numbers of the latest G.D.P. report don\u2019t tell us a whole lot, the fine print does shed some light on the forces shaping the economy in 2015.Exports fell at a 7.2 percent annual rate, which surely in part reflects the steep run-up in the value of the dollar on global currency markets in the second half of 2014; that shift could weigh on overall growth throughout the year. A strong dollar makes American-made goods more expensive in overseas markets. Over all, trade subtracted 1.25 percentage points from economic growth, and because it takes time for currency shifts to ripple through trade patterns, it could be a negative for some time.In effect, the economy will be fine if consumer spending strengthens to offset the drag on trade coming from the strong dollar, but there was no real evidence that was happening in the first quarter of the year.Another detail of the latest report offers a sunnier story. Investment in commercial structures \u2014 think office buildings, hospitals, factories \u2014 fell at a whopping 23.1 percent annual rate, subtracting 0.75 percentage points from overall G.D.P. Forecasters had expected a decline, but not one that steep; that alone helps explain why they were too optimistic about overall growth. The drop reflects in part a pullback in investment in mines and oil wells owing to falling energy prices. But the good news is there isn\u2019t much reason to think that reflects the underlying trend in the commercial building industry.The forecasts of truly robust economic growth that were commonplace at the start of the year aren\u2019t off the table yet. But anyone predicting that outcome has to be at least a little nervous: In the months ahead, data will need to improve to match those sunny forecasts, or 2015 will start to look like a big disappointment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Car Sales Make Biggest Leap in a Year", "Date": "2015-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 European automakers last month had their best showing in a year, an industry report showed on Thursday, as the economic recovery and incentive programs lifted sales across the region.Separately, the central bank on Thursday provided further evidence that the eurozone economy was improving, with its survey of professional forecasters showing that they had raised their expectations significantly compared with three months ago.For this year, the 59 economic forecasters raised their estimates for eurozone growth to 1.4 percent, compared with 1.1 percent in the previous quarterly survey. For 2016, they predicted growth of 1.7 percent compared with a previous average forecast of 1.5 percent.The forecasters also predicted that unemployment in the 19 countries in the eurozone would fall to 10.3 percent by 2016, from an estimated 11.3 percent this year, the European Central Bank said.At his news briefing on Wednesday, Mr. Draghi cited lower oil prices and the weaker euro, which helps exporters, as helping to lift private sector demand. He also credited the central bank\u2019s monetary stimulus for having made it easier for households to obtain credit, an important factor in the auto market.Manufacturers\u2019 incentives, including price cuts and rebates, also helped to spur auto sales, though at the cost of reducing profit margins.For the first three months of the year, auto sales in Europe rose 8.6 percent, to 3.5 million vehicles, the manufacturers\u2019 association said. If that pace is maintained through this year, it would put the overall market at 14 million cars sold. While still below the nearly 16 million sold in 2007, the peak, it would represent a significant recovery since sales fell to 11.9 million units in 2013.Hans-Peter Wodniok, an analyst at Fairesearch in Frankfurt, said there were signs that some companies might have \u201cartificially boosted\u201d their sales to maintain their market-share numbers, which manufacturers can do by selling to captive rental fleets or by so-called channel-stuffing, registering cars through dealers before they are sold to consumers.Still, he said, \u201cthe recovery is gaining pace.\u201dMr. Wodniok had forecast that the market would grow about 3 percent this year, but said the strength of the first quarter led him to believe that the growth rate could exceed 5 percent for 2015.That demand, he said, would probably enable carmakers to raise their prices somewhat, raising the companies\u2019 profitability.Volkswagen, the biggest European carmaker and No. 2 worldwide, after Toyota Motors, posted a 10 percent gain. PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, the second-largest in Europe, had an 8.7 percent gain, and Renault, the third-largest, posted a 10.2 percent gain.Luxury carmakers had a strong month. BMW\u2019s sales rose 10.6 percent, Daimler, maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, reported 18.9 percent growth.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Hard to Lift Wages if the Fed Doesn\u2019t Make It a Priority", "Date": "2015-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday's EconomistThe Federal Reserve is supposed to achieve two goals simultaneously: full employment with stable prices. Yet there is one obvious factor that drives American living standards but risks being lost in this mix: wages.The economic status of most working-age households is determined by whether people are employed and for how many hours. It is also affected by how quickly prices are rising and whether their paychecks are at least keeping up with, if not outpacing, those prices. Over the last few years, employment has been growing and inflation has been low. But annual wage growth has been stuck at about 2 percent going on six years now.This combination has caused some economists and Fed watchers to argue that the Fed should target wages as a third metric. Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, happens to agree with many of these wage-conscious analysts on a wide range of other economic issues, raising the possibility the Fed might indeed move in this direction.There are too many other factors driving wages, she argues, making their growth an unreliable benchmark of job market tautness. She cited productivity growth; global competition; technical changes that influence employers\u2019 skill demands and thus wage offers; and the decline in unions.\u201cWe can never be sure what growth rate of nominal wages is consistent with stable consumer price inflation,\u201d she said in her speech, \u201cand this uncertainty limits the usefulness of wage trends as an indicator of the Fed\u2019s progress in achieving its inflation objective.\u201dThe current unemployment rate is an unreliable indicator of the job market\u2019s strength.The unemployment rate has long informed Fed policy by signaling the extent of slack in the labor market, but in recent years, it has been biased down in this regard. For example, the job market is not as tight as its current level of 5.5 percent unemployment suggests.Labor market slack (properly measured) really does move wages.Ms. Yellen worries that a wage target wouldn\u2019t work, because all of those other wage-influencing factors will prevent wages from responding to labor market tightening. But globalization and deunionizaton, among other long-term, slow-moving factors, have been influencing wages for many decades. The relevant question for a Fed considering wage targeting is: Given all these underlying dynamics, does the tighter job market still move wage growth in the near term? If the answer to that question is yes, then wage targeting might still make a lot of sense.Lack of wage growth for most workers isn\u2019t a minor problem; it has been the central weakness of the economy for most of the last 40 years.For many workers, the persistent and broad-based gains in pay associated with full employment have been a missing ingredient in economic recoveries for decades now, with the latter 1990s as the exception that proves the rule. As unemployment fell sharply in those years, hitting 4 percent in 2000, real wages began rising across the pay scale. Targeting wage growth could be a way to ensure that more of the economy\u2019s growth reaches workers\u2019 paychecks.There\u2019s no evidence that wage growth is boosting price growth.The theory at the Fed is that a tightening job market leads workers to demand more pay, leading producers to mark up prices to maintain profitability in the face of higher labor costs. So the stagnant nominal wage growth we\u2019ve been experiencing since 2009 tells us that this cycle is not yet underway.Research suggests that this correlation \u2014 between prices and wages \u2014 has weakened. Economists from the Cleveland Fed recently wrote, \u201cWe do find that wages are sensitive to economic activity and the level of slack in the economy, but our forecasting results suggest that the ability of wages to help predict future inflation is limited.\u201dI admit that this is a bit confusing. If slack drives wages but wages don\u2019t drive prices, then it sounds like slack may not have as much to do with price growth as we thought. In which case, how is monetary policy supposed to gain any traction against inflation in the first place?The point is that while the usual targets are fuzzy right now, there\u2019s solid evidence that wage growth is a pretty reliable barometer of how tight the job market is. This may be why Goldman Sachs researchers recently wrote, \u201cWe find that the benefits of focusing on wage inflation are substantial [for the Fed] when slack is difficult to measure and wage growth acts as a reliable cross check for the true amount of spare capacity.\u201dAll of which points to this conclusion: If the Fed fails to give stagnant wage growth a central a role in economic policy-making, then wage growth may once again end up being weaker than it otherwise could be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Consumers Reflect the Pinch of Economic Sanctions", "Date": "2015-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The brand-new Avia Park is a glittering testament to the power of the Russian consumer. A panorama of white tile flooring, under a soaring, six story-tall glass roof, it is the largest mall in Europe, with 377,000 square meters of enclosed space, a 17-screen multiplex, even a 70-foot tall aquarium of tropical fish.There is just one problem: It is a ghost town.Row after row, storefronts are vacant. On a recent evening, a handful of visitors meandered past shops that have opened, but purchases are relatively rare. With no customers to serve, a chef at a Sbarro restaurant passed the time honing a knife.The thinning of the mall crowds is one of the clearest indications that Western sanctions over Russia\u2019s role in the Ukraine conflict and falling oil prices are starting to bite. At home, Russians are reining in their spending.\u201cI suddenly started to lack money for everything,\u201d Gadzhi Magomedov, a shopper at Avia Park, lamented over a Burger King meal in the food court on a recent evening.\u201cIt\u2019s terrible. We\u2019re in a war, and now it\u2019s too late to figure out who was guilty, and who was right. But the effect is all around and all negative,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people have money, they come to malls. And when they don\u2019t, they go to the outdoor markets, where everything\u2019s cheaper.\u201dFor years, Russian consumers spent freely, and the country\u2019s economy was flush with oil money. Such profligate spending was so common that a joke circulated of one Russian berating another for buying a tie when the same tie could be found for twice the price at a shop next door.Luxury and consumer goods companies poured into Moscow, which quickly shed its image as a city of Communist deprivation. A Russian distributor, the Mercury Group, built a successful business selling prestige brands including Armani, Breitling and Tiffany. Midtier labels like Zara and Banana Republic took hold, lifting profits for their foreign owners.No shopping mall seemed big enough to satisfy demand. The Mega Belaya Dacha opened here eight years ago, quickly taking pride of place as one of the largest malls in Europe. Three years later, another mall, called Vegas, rose out of a cucumber field on the edge of Moscow. The owners boasted that it was larger than the Mall of America, if the calculation excluded the Minnesota mall\u2019s seven-acre amusement park.As recently as last spring, the mall was on a path for a successful opening. Companies had nonbinding agreements to lease about 70 percent of the space, according to Maksim Sterlyagov, chief executive of Avia Park.Then Russia got hit by three rounds of sanctions and the price of oil dropped, hurting the economy and the Russian consumer.Russian wages adjusted for inflation are falling, ending the years of rising prosperity that had underpinned President Putin\u2019s popularity. In dollar terms, the average income in Moscow, the most important city for retailing, peaked in 2013 at $1,700 a month, while this year it is projected to average $900.Now, the long Russian shopping spree is winding down, faster than anybody expected. Companies are leaving. And the mall, Avia Park, which opened in November, is only half occupied.\u201cConfidence from the retailers was close to zero,\u201d Mr. Sterlyagov said.Zinaida Ivanova, a retiree browsing in M.Video, an electronics store, blamed American sanctions for the mall\u2019s troubles \u2014 and more. \u201cAmerica is an international bandit,\u201d she said. \u201cPoor Putin is pushing back the best he can.\u201dConsumer goods companies, whose executives once saw the emerging post-Soviet middle class as an opportunity on par with China, Brazil and India, have broadly been re-evaluating the prospects in Russia. This year, Zara, the Spanish fast fashion brand, closed its flagship store on Tverskaya Street. Zara\u2019s parent company, Inditex, which also owns Massimo Dutti, Pull and Bear and other labels, said it would halt Russian expansion. Gap closed a large outlet in the Atrium mall.Wendy\u2019s, the hamburger chain, Esprit, the clothing brand, and River Island, a British fashion shop, are all winding down operations in Russia. Adidas, the German shoe company, announced a restructuring that will close dozens of stores, though one did open in Avia Park.Over all, about one in 10 storefronts are vacant on Moscow\u2019s main shopping streets, according to a research note by Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate consultancy. Retail sales in Russia fell 7.7 percent in February compared with a year earlier.\u201cFinancially, they really have to throw out the business plan,\u201d Darrell Stanaford, a consultant with the Romanov Dvor shopping center in Moscow, said of Moscow\u2019s more than 80 malls, which have names like Mega and Metropolis.With the Russian economy slipping, managers at Avia Park say they are retooling, trying to draw in visitors who don\u2019t want to shop. Increasingly, they are emphasizing the low-cost family entertainment possibilities like the ice rink and restaurants. KidZania, a Mexican company, is developing a play area, where children can role-play in jobs like a delivery man or airline pilot and earn wages in a pretend currency.The mall\u2019s centerpiece, the four story-tall, saltwater fish tank, has become part of the strategy, too.The management retained an ichthyologist, a biologist who studies fish, to improve the economics of its operation. Some tropical fish had cost as much as $5,000 per specimen, Mr. Sterlyagov said. The specialist advised the mall to buy fish of the same size, and let them grow together, lest the larger ones eat the smaller ones.Of the few visitors in the mall, all paused to gaze up at this wonder, where schools of yellow-and-black striped fish, pink fish, rainbow fish, all of about the same size, twirled in an endless and mesmerizing spiral. It seemed a world apart from the dirty slush and deepening glum of evening outside.\u201cIf the overall political situation stabilizes, consumer confidence will come back,\u201d Mr. Sterlyagov said. For now, though, \u201cour economic model turned out different from reality.\u201dAnastasia Romadankeno, a saleswoman at a Crocs shoe store in the mall, expressed more optimism, noting that the shopping center had just opened. \u201cPeople will come,\u201d she said, in an empty store. \u201cPeople want to eat and need clothes, so they will come.\u201dAn article on April 10 about Russians\u2019 reining in their spending misstated the size of the Avia Park mall in Moscow. It is 377,000 square meters, not square feet. (It is 4.1 million square feet.) The error was repeated in an accompanying picture caption. The article, using information posted at the shopping center, also misstated the status of H&M and American Eagle Outfitters stores at the mall. The H&M store will open at a later date, but American Eagle Outfitters does not plan to open at the mall; the stores are not open now. The article also referred imprecisely to the Adidas store at the mall. While the Adidas Kids store is open, the main Adidas store is not yet open. And the article, using information from the mall management, referred incorrectly to the ownership of a company that invests in the mall. The company is owned by Igor Rotenberg \u2014 not by his father, Arkady Rotenberg.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Income Inequality Is Costing the U.S. on Social Issues", "Date": "2015-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThirty-five years ago, the United States ranked 13th among the 34 industrialized nations that are today in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in terms of life expectancy for newborn girls. These days, it ranks 29th.What\u2019s most shocking about these statistics is not how unhealthy they show Americans to be, compared with citizens of countries that spend much less on health care and have much less sophisticated medical technology. What is most perplexing is how stunningly fast the United States has lost ground.The blame for the precipitous fall does not rest primarily on the nation\u2019s doctors and hospitals.The United States has the highest teenage birthrate in the developed world \u2014 about seven times the rate in France, according to the O.E.C.D. More than one out of every four children lives with one parent, the largest percentage by far among industrialized nations. And more than a fifth live in poverty, sixth from the bottom among O.E.C.D. nations.The point is: The United States doesn\u2019t have a narrow health care problem. We\u2019ve simply handed our troubles to the medical industry to fix. In many ways, the American health care system is the most advanced in the world. But whiz-bang medical technology just cannot fix what ails us.American babies born to white, college-educated, married women survive as often as those born to advantaged women in Europe. It\u2019s the babies born to nonwhite, nonmarried, nonprosperous women who die so young.Three or four decades ago, the United States was the most prosperous country on earth. It had the mightiest military and the most advanced technologies known to humanity. Today, it\u2019s still the richest, strongest and most inventive. But when it comes to the health, well-being and shared prosperity of its people, the United States has fallen far behind.Pick almost any measure of social health and cohesion over the last four decades or so, and you will find that the United States took a wrong turn along the way.How did we get here? How do we exit?But blaming globalization and technological progress for the stagnation of the middle class and the precipitous decline in our collective health is too easy. Jobs were lost and wages got stuck in many developed countries. What set the United States apart \u2014 what made the damage inflicted upon American society so intense \u2014 was the nature of its response. Government support for Americans in the bottom half turned out to be too meager to hold society together.The conservative narrative of America\u2019s social downfall, articulated by the likes of Charles Murray from the American Enterprise Institute, posits that a large welfare state, built from the time of the New Deal in the 1930s through the era of the Great Society in the 1960s, sapped Americans\u2019 industriousness and undermined their moral fiber.A more compelling explanation is that when globalization struck at the jobs on which 20th-century America had built its middle class, the United States discovered that it did not, in fact, have much of a welfare state to speak of. The threadbare safety net tore under the strain.Call it a failure of solidarity. American institutions, built from hostility toward collective solutions, couldn\u2019t hold society together when the economic underpinning of full employment at a decent wage gave in.The question is, Is there a solution to fit these ideological preferences? The standard prescriptions, typically shared by liberals and conservatives, start with education, building the skills needed to harness the opportunities of a high-tech, fast-changing labor market that has little use for those who end their education after high school.Yet despite the grim prognosis, there is hope. The challenge America faces is not simply a matter of equity. The bloated incarceration rates and rock-bottom life expectancy, the unraveling families and the stagnant college graduation rates amount to an existential threat to the nation\u2019s future.That is, perhaps, the best reason for hope. The silver lining in these dismal, if abstract, statistics, is that they portend such a dysfunctional future that our broken political system might finally be forced to come together to prevent it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece May Have Ruined Its Best Chance", "Date": "2015-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeBRUSSELS \u2014 Even if it survives the next three months teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, Greece may have blown its best chance of a long-term debt deal by alienating its eurozone partners when it most needed their support.Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s leftist-led government has so thoroughly shattered creditors\u2019 trust that solutions that might have been on offer a few weeks ago now seem out of reach.With a public debt equal to 175 percent of output and an economy struggling to pull out of a six-year depression, Athens needs all the good will it can summon. It owes 80 percent of that debt to official lenders after private bondholders took a hefty write-down in 2012.Since outright debt forgiveness is politically impossible, the next-best solution would be for Greece to pay off its expensive I.M.F. loans early, redeem bonds held by the European Central Bank and extend the maturity of loans from eurozone governments to secure lower interest rates.\u201cThis step would save Greece\u2019s budget billions of euros, while reforming the troika arrangement, eliminating the I.M.F.\u2019s and the E.C.B.\u2019s financial exposure to Greece,\u201d said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The troika is the group of Greece\u2019s international creditors: the I.M.F., the European Central Bank and the European Commission.The move would lower the effective interest rate on Greek debt to less than 2 percent, far less than Athens was paying before the eurozone debt crisis began in 2009, and radically reduce the principal amount to be repaid over the next decade, giving Greece fiscal breathing space to revive its economy.But if the economics make sense for Greece, the politics no longer add up for its partners. Mr. Tsipras\u2019s denunciations of European Union-prescribed austerity, his demands for German war reparations and his cozying up to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, along with Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s delaying tactics over negotiations and initial calls for a \u201chaircut\u201d on Greek debt, have dried up the reservoir of sympathy for Athens.Creditors like Germany, the Netherlands and Finland are eager to keep the I.M.F. involved as an enforcer of fiscal discipline because they do not trust the Greeks to keep their word, nor the European Commission to hold them to it.\u201cThey would prefer to provide debt relief on an annual basis so they keep leverage on Greece to stick to the program,\u201d said Miranda Xafa, senior scholar at the Center for International Governance Innovation and a consultant on Greek debt.True, Greece\u2019s eurozone peers Ireland and Portugal, which received international bailouts after Athens, worked out an agreement with the European Union to pay off their costlier I.M.F. loans faster. But Dublin and Lisbon were able to do so by borrowing more cheaply from private lenders after completing their bailout programs and regaining access to the capital markets.\u201cIreland and Portugal are governments in difficulty, but they are not difficult governments,\u201d said Elena Daly of EM Conseil, a Paris-based sovereign debt management adviser.Because Greece is stalling on its program and lacks market access, the only way it could pay off 24 billion euros, or about $25.4 billion, owed to the I.M.F. and redeem \u20ac27 billion worth of bonds held by the European Central Bank would be for the eurozone\u2019s rescue fund to lend it the money. That would require eurozone governments to risk more money than the roughly \u20ac170 billion they have already loaned Greece. Eurozone finance ministers promised in 2012 to \u201cconsider further measures and assistance\u201d to ease Greece\u2019s debt, provided it stuck to the terms of its program, which it has not done.A referendum asking Greeks whether they want to stay in the eurozone at the price of painful economic overhauls, or a quick coalition change to bring in pro-reform centrists, may be Mr. Tsipras\u2019s best options, even if they split his Syriza party.Greece\u2019s official creditors are torn between wanting to keep the country in the eurozone to avoid the precedent of an exit and fearing that if Mr. Tsipras manages to roll back austerity and secure debt relief, he could embolden like-minded political forces in Ireland, Portugal and Spain. \u201cSo they want Greece to prosper and stay in the euro, while at the same time wanting the new administration to fall on its face and become an object lesson for other electorates who may be toying with the idea of rebellion,\u201d Ms. Daly said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Governor Orders New Target for Emissions Cuts", "Date": "2015-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe order, announced early Wednesday morning, was intended as a jolt to a landmark 2006 environmental law requiring an 80 percent cut in greenhouse gas reductions by 2050, compared with 1990. Under Mr. Brown\u2019s order, the state would have to get halfway there \u2014 a 40 percent reduction \u2014 by 2030.Mr. Brown said this tough new interim target was essential to prod the energy industry to act and to help the state make investment and regulatory decisions that would assure that goal was not missed.The order is the latest effort by Mr. Brown to position California as a leading force in the world\u2019s effort to address climate change \u2014 and position himself as a leader of that effort as he enters his final years in public office. It also is an aggressive turn in what already was one of the toughest programs in the nation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\u201cIt\u2019s a real test,\u201d Mr. Brown, a Democrat, said in a speech at an environmental conference in downtown Los Angeles. \u201cNot just for California, not just for America, but for the world. Can we rise above the parochialisms, the ethnocentric perspectives, the immediacy of I-want-I-need, to a vision, a way of life, that is sustainable?\u201d Under the law put into place by Mr. Brown\u2019s predecessor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the state was required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 on the way to reach the 2050 target; California is already well on its way to meeting the 2020 goal, and may exceed it, officials said Thursday.\u201cWith this order, California sets a very high bar for itself and other states and nations, but it\u2019s one that must be reached \u2014 for this generation and generations to come,\u201d Mr. Brown said. These efforts come as this state has been struggling with a drought that Mr. Brown has said is, at least in part, exacerbated by global warming.The governor\u2019s speech, coming at a time when he has been trying to rally the state behind tough water conservation measures, was a reminder of the often conflicting demands of these twin challenges. Some of the central efforts proposed to alleviate the drought \u2014 including the building of desalination plants to make ocean water potable \u2014 are highly energy intensive.The governor\u2019s order did not give details of how the state would reach the new goals, though Mr. Brown in his speech here noted the success of the auto and energy industry so far in meeting the emission targets that the state has set over the years. \u201cWe\u2019re sending the signals to the private economy to create, to innovate, and to make the kind of response that will enable Californians to live in compatibility with the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do it.\u201dAn interactive map shows how much water California residents conserved in April and how much daily consumption they are being forced to cut under new mandatory restrictions.The study projected that these policies would result in a net cost of $14 a month per household. The projection takes into account sharp increases in the cost of fuels and investment in energy-saving technology, balanced off, for example, by the projected decline in demand for gasoline caused by an increased reliance on hybrid vehicles.Republican lawmakers quickly denounced the order as a threat to the state\u2019s economy at a time when California has been climbing out of a steep slump. \u201cThese higher costs will hurt the low income and working poor the hardest and will create an even greater divide between the haves and have-nots,\u201d said Bob Huff, the Senate Republican leader. \u201cAt what point does being on the leading edge of climate change and environmental reform impact our ability to create or sustain jobs?\u201dBut Democratic lawmakers, who have been pushing through legislation intended to help achieve long-term cuts in emissions, applauded the governor\u2019s action. Kevin de Leon, the Democratic leader of the State Senate, said Mr. Brown\u2019s order exemplified \u201cCalifornia\u2019s global leadership on climate change.\u201d\u201cWe see the framework of a new economy for tomorrow,\u201d Mr. de Leon said in an interview. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s critical that we move forward with these far-reaching and progressive policies. That is why the world is watching what we are doing here in California.\u201d\u201cCalifornia\u2019s announcement is a realization and a determination that will gladly resonate with other inspiring actions within the United States and around the globe,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is yet another reason for optimism in advance of the U.N. climate conference in Paris in December.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unsafe and Unsound Banks ", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAt issue this time around is the level of bank capital, which reflects the amount of loss a bank can endure before failing (or, if the bank is \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d requiring a bailout). According to the Fed\u2019s main measure, capital at the eight largest American banks averaged 12.9 percent of assets at the end of 2014, well above required regulatory minimums.The discrepancy is due mainly to differing views of the risk posed by the banks\u2019 vast holdings of derivative contracts used for hedging and speculation. The Fed, in keeping with American accounting rules and central bank accords, assumes that gains and losses on derivatives generally net out. As a result, most derivatives do not show up as assets on banks\u2019 balance sheets, an omission that bolsters the ratio of capital to assets. Mr. Hoenig uses stricter international accounting rules to value the derivatives. Those rules do not assume that gains and losses reliably net out. As a result, large derivative holdings are shown as assets on the balance sheet, an addition that reduces the ratio of capital to assets to the low levels reported in Mr. Hoenig\u2019s analysis. In a recent speech, Mr. Hoenig noted that under American accounting rules, derivative holdings add $300 billion to the balance sheets of five top banks \u2014 JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

All this hasn\u2019t benefited all Americans. A newly released global index finds that America falls short, along with other powerful countries, on what matters most: assuring a high quality of life for ordinary citizens.The index ranks the United States 30th in life expectancy, 38th in saving children\u2019s lives, and a humiliating 55th in women surviving childbirth. O.K., we know that we have a high homicide rate, but we\u2019re at risk in other ways as well. We have higher traffic fatality rates than 37 other countries, and higher suicide rates than 80.We also rank 32nd in preventing early marriage, 38th in the equality of our education system, 49th in high school enrollment rates and 87th in cellphone use.Ouch. \u201cWe\u2019re No. 87!\u201d doesn\u2019t have much of a ring to it, does it?\u201cWe\u2019re not now No. 1 in a lot of stuff that traditionally we have been,\u201d said Professor Porter, an expert on international competitiveness. \u201cWhat we\u2019re learning is that the fact that we\u2019re not No. 1 on this stuff also means that we\u2019re facing long-term economic stresses.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re starting to understand that we can\u2019t put economic development and social progress in two separate buckets,\u201d Porter added. \u201cThere\u2019s a dialectic here.\u201dThe top countries in the 2015 Social Progress Index are Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Iceland, New Zealand and Canada. Of the 133 countries rated, Central African Republic is last, just after Chad and Afghanistan.Sri Lanka does better than India. Bangladesh outperforms Pakistan. Both the Philippines and South Africa do better than Russia. Mongolia comes in ahead of China. And Canada wallops the United States.One way of looking at the index is to learn from countries that outperform by having social indicators better than their income levels. By that standard, the biggest stars are Costa Rica and Uruguay, with New Zealand and Rwanda also outperforming.Then there are the underperformers that do worse than would be expected from their income level. Saudi Arabia leads that list.The Social Progress Index, now in its second year, might seem a clarion call for greater equality, but that\u2019s not quite right. Professor Porter and his number-crunchers found only a mild correlation between economic equality (measured by Gini coefficient) and social progress. What mattered much more was poverty.Of course, wealthy countries with high poverty tend to be unequal as well. But inequality at the top seems to matter less for well-being than inequality at the bottom. Perhaps we should worry less about reining in the top 1 percent and more about helping the bottom 20 percent?On the other hand, one way to finance empowerment programs is to raise taxes on tycoons. And when there is tremendous inequality, the wealthy create private alternatives to public goods \u2014 private schools, private security forces, gated communities \u2014 that lead to disinvestment in public goods vital to the needy.In any case, the 2015 Social Progress Index should serve notice to Americans \u2014 and to people around the globe. We obsess on the wrong measures, so we often have the wrong priorities.As an American, what saddens me is also that our political system seems unable to rise to the challenges.We can send people to space and turn watches into computers, but we seem incapable of consensus on the issues that matter most to our children \u2014 so our political system remains in gridlock, even as other countries pass us by.Advertisement"}

Sees Early Progress From Its Bond-Buying Program", "Date": "2015-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA young woman jumped from the news media seats at the Europe Central Bank press conference and tossed papers and confetti at Mario Draghi,\u00a0the central bank president.FRANKFURT \u2014 Just weeks ago, the European Central Bank began a bond-buying program intended to stimulate the economy and to last at least 18 months. On Wednesday, the bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, indicated that the measure had already begun to bear fruit.The eurozone as he described it is benefiting from a convergence of low oil prices, improved government policy and \u2014 not least \u2014 the bank\u2019s newest stimulus program.A bond-buying program begun a month ago is \u201cproceeding smoothly,\u201d Mr. Draghi said at a news conference, which happened to take place on one of the balmiest spring days of the year so far in Frankfurt.Mr. Draghi\u2019s news conference did not proceed quite as smoothly. As he was briefing reporters, a young woman jumped from the news media seats, tossed papers and confetti at Mr. Draghi and shouted \u201cend E.C.B. dictatorship\u201d before she was subdued by security guards. It was a rare breach of bank security.The central bank said in a statement later that the protester had masqueraded as a journalist, passed an identity check and had been through a metal detector. After a brief break, Mr. Draghi, though he appeared rattled, resumed reading the central bank\u2019s opening statement.While acknowledging that extremely low interest rates could feed asset bubbles or pose other risks, Mr. Draghi said the central bank was sticking to its plan to keep buying government bonds and other debt at a rate of 60 billion euros, or about $63.6 billion, a month at least through September 2016.He said there was no sign that, as some analysts have argued, the central bank could have trouble finding enough debt to buy that meets its standards.Talk about \u201cscarcity in the bond market is really premature,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t see such a phenomenon.\u201dThe program, known as quantitative easing, is a form of money printing intended to push down interest rates and nudge inflation back toward the official target of close to 2 percent. While improvement in inflation will take some time, the effect on bonds has been more immediate, as the program has stoked demand. As Mr. Draghi pledged his commitment to the stimulus, the yield on Germany\u2019s 10-year bond dropped more than 20 percent to 0.105 in afternoon trading in Europe, potentially on the way to joining Switzerland in having negative long-term yields.The newness of the bond-buying program has not stopped some economists from urging the European Central Bank to start planning how to taper its purchases \u2014 as the Federal Reserve is already doing in the United States.On Wednesday, economists at Allianz, a large German insurer, called on the central bank to establish benchmarks for scaling back its bond buying. As inflation picks up, the bank should cut its purchases to avoid negative side effects, the Allianz economists said.\u201cThe program has substantial effects on financial markets,\u201d Michael Heise, the chief economist at Allianz, said in a meeting with several reporters on Wednesday. \u201cThe E.C.B. has to confront the question of whether it should have some flexibility built into the program.\u201dMr. Draghi batted away suggestions that the central bank should already be discussing how to back out of bond buying.\u201cWe\u2019ve been in this program only a month,\u201d Mr. Draghi said, invoking a simile on running. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking yourself after 1K, are you going to finish this marathon?\u201dHe acknowledged that central bank intervention in debt markets, which have pushed the market interest rates on many government bonds into negative territory, comes with risks.\u201cWe are aware that very low interest rates for a very long time are fertile terrain for financial stability imbalances,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cHaving said that, we don\u2019t see at this point in time evidence of systemically large financial imbalances.\u201dThe central bank could deal with any risks by using its power as a bank regulator, he said, not by changing monetary policy. Eurozone banks are in much better shape than they were three years ago, he added, so that borrowers are finally benefiting from the cheap cash the central bank makes available to commercial lenders.\u201cMore accommodative monetary policy is being translated into better credit conditions,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is not something we have seen before.\u201dMr. Draghi noted that financial forecasters had followed the lead of the E.C.B. as it raised its economic growth expectation for 2015, predicting it will accelerate to 1.5 percent from an earlier forecast of 1 percent.While government borrowing costs continued to drop, stocks on Wednesday were little changed, rising by 0.5 percent. The euro, which has fallen sharply against the dollar in recent months, was down slightly to about $1.06.The central bank also left its main interest rate unchanged at a low of 0.05 percent. As a policy tool, it has been all but eclipsed by the so-called quantitative easing program that the central bank began in March.Some economists are hesitant to give too much credit to the European Central Bank for recent growth. The economy has also benefited from low fuel prices and a steep fall in the value of the euro, which bolsters exports by making products from the eurozone less expensive for customers paying in dollars and other major currencies.Cheap fuel and a weak euro will most likely be temporary, and economists have warned that the recovery could be short-lived unless eurozone countries do more to create permanent conditions for faster growth, for example by loosening rigid labor regulations.\u201cThe risk is great that if these conditions turn around, there would be a big drop in growth,\u201d Mr. Heise of Allianz said. \u201cThe economy is not yet self-sustaining.\u201dMr. Draghi said that, while governments have made progress in improving business conditions, they should take advantage of favorable conditions now to do more, for example making it easier for companies to hire and fire.\u201cOur monetary policy finds its natural complement in structural reforms,\u201d he said.Mr. Draghi did not appear overly concerned that Greece\u2019s financial condition is an imminent threat to the stability of the eurozone. The European Central Bank plays a crucial role because it controls the flow of emergency lending to Greek banks, without which some would probably collapse.The E.C.B. has taken a hard line with the government of Greece but has avoided a bigger crisis by providing a drip feed of cash to Greek banks. European Central Bank lending to Greek banks has reached \u20ac110 billion, Mr. Draghi said, more than any other eurozone country in terms of the proportion to the size of the economy.Mr. Draghi said the central bank would continue to support Greek banks. But he emphasized that it was up to political leaders to resolve an impasse over the terms of European Union loans to the Athens government.\u201cIt\u2019s entirely in the hands of the Greek government,\u201d he said, \u201cand the negotiations that are taking place between the Greek government and the euro area members.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stampede to Join China\u2019s Development Bank Stuns Even Its Founder", "Date": "2015-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisBut after the deadline, China announced that it had attracted 46 founding members for its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Among the surprises: While China had expected to be joined by its neighbors, the final tally of countries looking to participate included 14 advanced economies of the Group of 20, many of them, like Brazil, France and Germany, from outside Asia.\u201cSuch wide and warm support was unexpected,\u201d said Jin Canrong, professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing.The last-minute surge to join the bank was considered a major victory for China in a rare public showdown with the United States, which opposed the bank, as the two powers try to outmaneuver each other for influence in Asia. It was also a recognition of economic reality. China has deep pockets, and the institutions backed by the United States have not met the growing demands for roads, railroads and pipelines in Asia.American officials seem to see the new institution as an effort to undercut the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, international financial institutions dominated by the United States and Japan. Obama administration officials have also expressed concern that the new bank, under China\u2019s leadership, would ignore lending protections created to ensure, for instance, that vulnerable populations are not pushed from their land in the rush for development.That the United States\u2019 allies in Europe and Asia flouted Washington\u2019s appeals not to join the bank has brought a sense of triumph to Chinese officials and scholars who say that China has now demonstrated it can construct a broad-based institution without the United States in the lead.\u201cThis has shown China that you don\u2019t always have to work your way with the United States, that you can work your way with the region and many others outside the region,\u201d said Wu Xinbo, the director of the American Studies Center at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cAs long as people think what you are doing is beneficial and that you are providing for the public good, you don\u2019t need U.S. approval.\u201dWashington basically undermined itself by failing to allow a bigger voice for China in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, said David Daokui Li, a former adviser to the People\u2019s Bank of China who has a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard.\u201cThe Americans got nervous, saying to its allies, \u2018You guys can\u2019t join, they are not dependable,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cBut in the end, all of America\u2019s best allies ended up joining. We should be the ones most surprised, not the Americans.\u201d \u201cHe said China should not be able to write the rules \u2014 the United States should write the rules,\u201d Ms. Glaser said.Now that the United States has lost the battle, it has softened its position, saying that it will encourage the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to cooperate with the new bank, provided projects meet certain standards.Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew flew to Beijing this week to deliver that message to Prime Minister Li Keqiang. Yet the shift to a more constructive position was viewed as late, and the repercussions of what many considered poor handling by Washington were on display at the Boao Forum for Asia in southern China last weekend, where President Xi Jinping spoke about his views on Asia to more than 1,000 delegates, many from outside China.\u201cI was struck by how much praise there was for China from elsewhere, and how the United States seemed to be absent,\u201d Ms. Glaser said.Now, the onus is on the Chinese organizers to build an institution that meets transparency, lending and environmental standards, and that fits the demands of many kinds of members with different agendas.The interim head of the bank, Jin Liqun, who has worked at the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, is \u201can experienced, savvy guy,\u201d said Nicholas R.

{"Headline": "Where Government Excels", "Date": "2015-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis is a welcome development in two ways. First, the specific case for expanding Social Security is quite good. Second, and more fundamentally, Democrats finally seem to be standing up to antigovernment propaganda and recognizing the reality that there are some things the government does better than the private sector.Like all advanced nations, America mainly relies on private markets and private initiatives to provide its citizens with the things they want and need, and hardly anyone in our political discourse would propose changing that. The days when it sounded like a good idea to have the government directly run large parts of the economy are long past.Yet we also know that some things more or less must be done by government. Every economics textbooks talks about \u201cpublic goods\u201d like national defense and air traffic control that can\u2019t be made available to anyone without being made available to everyone, and which profit-seeking firms, therefore, have no incentive to provide. But are public goods the only area where the government outperforms the private sector? By no means. One classic example of government doing it better is health insurance. Yes, conservatives constantly agitate for more privatization \u2014 in particular, they want to convert Medicare into nothing more than vouchers for the purchase of private insurance \u2014 but all the evidence says this would move us in precisely the wrong direction. Medicare and Medicaid are substantially cheaper and more efficient than private insurance; they even involve less bureaucracy. Internationally, the American health system is unique in the extent to which it relies on the private sector, and it\u2019s also unique in its incredible inefficiency and high costs.And there\u2019s another major example of government superiority: providing retirement security.Maybe we wouldn\u2019t need Social Security if ordinary people really were the perfectly rational, farsighted agents economists like to assume in their models (and right-wingers like to assume in their propaganda). In an idealized world, 25-year-old workers would base their decisions about how much to save on a realistic assessment of what they will need to live comfortably when they\u2019re in their 70s. They\u2019d also be smart and sophisticated in how they invested those savings, carefully seeking the best trade-offs between risk and return.You might be tempted to say that if workers save too little and invest badly, it\u2019s their own fault. But people have jobs and children, and they must cope with all the crises of life. It\u2019s unfair to expect them to be expert investors, too. In any case, the economy is supposed to work for real people leading real lives; it shouldn\u2019t be an obstacle course only a few can navigate.And in the real world of retirement, Social Security is a shining example of a system that works. It\u2019s simple and clean, with low operating costs and minimal bureaucracy. It provides older Americans who worked hard all their lives with a chance of living decently in retirement, without requiring that they show an inhuman ability to think decades ahead and be investment whizzes as well. The only problem is that the decline of private pensions, and their replacement with inadequate 401(k)-type plans, has left a gap that Social Security isn\u2019t currently big enough to fill. So why not make it bigger?But true seriousness means looking at what works and what doesn\u2019t. Privatized retirement schemes work very badly; Social Security works very well. And we should build on that success. Advertisement"}

The Chinese news media later reported that the meeting was held at the request of Japan.The two leaders met for about half an hour, about half the customary time for such diplomatic sessions. In Beijing last November, their meeting was also short.\u201cThe Sino-Japanese relationship is far from good,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cXi still holds great distrust of Abe, and Abe has distrust of Xi.\u201dThe territorial issue that divides China and Japan \u2014 the sovereignty of a cluster of islands in the East China Sea \u2014 was probably not raised by either of the leaders because the gap was too profound, Mr. Shi said. The islands are known as the Diaoyu in China and as the Senkaku in Japan.Last November, the two countries released formal documents outlining their differences on the islands, hardened positions that would not be changed any time soon, diplomats said.The Chinese leader most likely raised the possibility of Japan joining the new China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank at a later stage, Mr. Shi said. Japan, along with the United States, is not a founding member of the bank, which has attracted more than 50 countries, including a majority of the Group of 20\u2019s advanced economies.Mr. Abe, a conservative politician with a strong nationalist streak, is believed to be opposed to Japan joining the China-led bank, while members of his cabinet in charge of the economy have expressed modest interest.Mr. Abe is due in Washington this month, where he will address a joint session of Congress, and where he and President Obama are expected to emphasize the strength of the alliance between Japan and the United States.A Chinese expert on Japan said on Wednesday that Mr. Abe was most likely anxious to meet Mr. Xi in order to reassure the Obama administration.\u201cAbe wants to tell Obama that, \u2018I want to relax the tensions with China, I\u2019m not a troublemaker in the relations with China and South Korea,\u2019 \u201d said the expert, Huang Dahui, dean of the department of diplomacy at Renmin University.Earlier in the day, Mr. Abe told the gathering in Jakarta that in order to maintain the spirit of the Bandung Conference, large countries should keep their ambitions in check. In today\u2019s context, Mr. Abe was apparently referring to China.\u201cWe should never allow to go unchecked the use of force by the mightier to twist the weaker around,\u201d Mr. Abe said. \u201cThe wisdom of our forefathers in Bandung was that the rule of law should protect the dignity of sovereign nations, be they large or small.\u201dMr. Xi told Mr. Abe that he would like to improve communication with Japan and work with him so that the two countries did not pose a threat to each other, the state-run China National Radio said.Yufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Lifts Ban on Russian Missile Sales to Iran", "Date": "2015-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sale could also undermine the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to sell Congress and foreign allies on the nuclear deal, which Iran and the United States are still struggling to complete. It might also reduce the United States\u2019 leverage in the talks by making it much harder for the United States or Israel to mount airstrikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure if the country ignored such an agreement.\u201cIt is significant as it complicates the calculus for planning any military option involving airstrikes,\u201d said David A. Deptula, a retired three-star general who served as the Air Force\u2019s deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.No timetable was announced for delivering the weapons, S-300 surface-to-air missiles. The sale was suspended five years ago amid a flurry of United Nations sanctions against the Islamic republic.Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said that far from complicating the continuing negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program the missile sales would help them along.\u201cIt was done in the spirit of good will in order to encourage progress in the talks,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said in a televised statement. \u201cWe believe that the need for this kind of embargo, indeed a separate, voluntary Russian embargo, has completely disappeared.\u201dThe missile deal does not pose a threat to Israel, Mr. Lavrov said, emphasizing that the S-300 is a defensive weapon.The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany have been negotiating with Iran for years to try to make sure that its nuclear program remains peaceful.Along with congressional Republicans, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been sharply critical of the nuclear deal, saying that although it would free Iran from debilitating economic sanctions, it would do nothing to stop the country from getting a nuclear weapon.On Monday, his intelligence minister, Yuval Steinitz, issued a statement saying the deal showed that \u201cthe economic momentum in Iran that will come in the wake of lifting the sanctions will be exploited for armaments and not used for the welfare of the Iranian people.\u201dIran, he added, \u201cis being allowed to arm itself with advanced weapons that will only increase its aggression.\u201dWhite House officials repeated the administration\u2019s objections to the missile sale, noting that Secretary of State John Kerry had expressed those concerns recently to Mr. Lavrov.American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201cI\u2019m not in a position to speculate on the decision-making process that Russia is engaged in right now,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s safe to say that Russia understands that the United States certainly takes very seriously the safety and security of our allies in the region.\u201dMr. Earnest also said the administration was concerned about the possibility that Russia could enter into a deal with Iran to barter food for oil that could raise \u201cpotential sanctions concerns.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll obviously evaluate these two proposals moving forward,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in direct touch with Russia to make sure that they understand \u2014 and they do \u2014 the potential concerns we have.\u201dMr. Lavrov, alluding to recent airstrikes by Saudi Arabia and others against Iranian allies in Yemen, suggested that Iran needed a more robust air defense system. \u201cFor Iran, which is located in the volatile Middle East region, a modern air defense system is very important, especially now that tensions have run high in the surrounding environment,\u201d he said.Mr. Lavrov also noted that Moscow could use the money. The Russian economy, battered by a steep drop in the price of oil and by Western sanctions imposed over Moscow\u2019s actions on behalf of separatists in Ukraine, is expected to fall into a recession this year.Russia has been aggressively seeking new trade partners to prove that Western sanctions have not isolated it from the global economy. Although the full details have not been disclosed, the Russian news media reported that Moscow had negotiated an oil-for-goods exchange with Iran that would involve acquiring some 500,000 barrels of Iranian oil a day in exchange for Russian equipment and goods. Iran has long been one of the main buyers of Russian wheat, for example.\u201cWe need to think about the future of our trade partnership,\u201d said Andrei A. Klimov, the deputy chairman of the foreign relations committee in the Federation Council, Russia\u2019s Senate. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to wait for anybody else. It is a kind of competition, if you like.\u201dSince resuming the presidency in 2012, Mr. Putin has worked to restore some of the great-power status Russia lost with the disintegration of the Soviet Union, not least by cultivating relations with countries hostile to the United States, like Venezuela and, to some extent, China. Cultivating Iran fits into that pattern.For Russia, \u201cit is always good to have some third world countries hostile to the West, hostile to America,\u201d said Georgy I. Mirsky of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, who is one of Russia\u2019s leading Middle East analysts.Even if an eventual nuclear agreement drives some degree of reconciliation between the West and Iran, the early lifting of the missile deal signals that \u201cRussia will always be a really loyal partner and, if not an ally, at least a friend of Iran,\u201d he said.Not surprisingly, Iran praised the move as an important step toward improved relations.There was some debate as to just how much the missiles would improve Iran\u2019s military capabilities.The five S-300 squadrons cannot shield all of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, said Simon Saradzhyan, an expert on arms control and Russia at Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center, while noting that Russia just sold China the more sophisticated S-400 system. The official Tass news agency reported that in February Moscow offered Tehran an air defense system more modern than the S-300, but that no decision had been made.Still, military experts said the highly capable S-300 system would make it much harder for the United States or Israel to stage airstrikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.Although Iran denies that it is using its civilian nuclear program to mask efforts to build a bomb, many Western countries are dubious. And Israel has made no secret of its willingness to consider a military strike to halt Iran\u2019s progress, though it is not known to possess bunker-buster bombs powerful enough to destroy all of Iran\u2019s bomb-making capacity.More than missile systems, what Iran really needs is to escape the principal financial and economic sanctions, the ones that cut off substantial trade and access to much of the world\u2019s banking system, Mr. Saradzhyan said.Reporting was contributed by Andrew Roth from Moscow, Jodi Rudoren from Jerusalem, Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran, and Michael R.

{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs Reports Robust Earnings as Trading Revives", "Date": "2015-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bank said on Thursday that its business lines across the board were stronger in the first quarter, pushing the firm\u2019s overall profit to its highest level in five years.The strongest performance came from the desks where derivatives and currencies are bought and sold, an area that has lagged in recent years at Goldman and many other banks.Goldman has faced questions about its emphasis on its trading businesses, even as other firms have scaled back on the strategy when costs rose because of new regulatory scrutiny.In a town hall-style meeting with the company\u2019s employees Thursday morning, Goldman\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said that the strong performance during the first quarter was a result of years of efforts to adapt to the new environment, according to a person who attended the meeting.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.Goldman\u2019s chief financial officer, Harvey Schwartz, said in a conference call that analysts had not properly appreciated the degree to which the firm had been positioning itself for conditions that are likely to become more common.\u201cWhile you were beating us up, we were spending a lot of time focused on the clients and staying very, very committed to the business, and we\u2019re seeing it translate through,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said.With more activity in financial markets globally over the last few months, investors had recently been ramping up their expectations for a strong quarter from Goldman \u2014 so much so that the bank\u2019s stock actually fell on Thursday after the earnings were released, ending the day down slightly.Goldman\u2019s results underscored how volatile Wall Street\u2019s central businesses still are, even after years of efforts by regulators to make the industry less risky and vulnerable to big swings.The amount of revenue that Goldman made from its equity trading desks more than doubled from a year ago, and the money coming in from its bond and currency trading operations more than doubled from the previous quarter, going to $3.1 billion from $1.2 billion.Mr. Schwartz sounded confident that the improvement during the first quarter points toward a more sustained pickup in the type of trading activity Goldman relies on.He said that the big increases in revenue were helped by the divergence in monetary policy in the United States, where stimulus programs are being scaled back, and Europe, where the central bank has recently been stepping up its efforts to stimulate the economy. That led some clients to ask Goldman for structured trades that benefit from markets moving in different directions.But Mr. Schwartz emphasized that the strong results were not a result of a single successful trade or single geographic region, and instead attributed them to \u201cstrong contributions across the entire business.\u201dAnalysts pushed for more detail on where the performance came from and sounded somewhat unsatisfied by the breakdown on what exactly led to the big numbers over the last three months.\u201cOne reason why these companies do not have the greatest multiples is that they don\u2019t disclose this stuff very well,\u201d said Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst at Oppenheimer. \u201cIt is very opaque.\u201dThe opacity, Mr. Kotowski said, makes it harder for analysts and investors to determine if the results are likely to continue, though Mr. Schwartz sounded confident that they would.Goldman\u2019s results come at the end of a week in which the other big banks also announced that their equity trading desks had a good first quarter.

That law created tougher penalties for drug offenders and devoted $30.2 billion to put more police officers on the street and build new prisons.\u201cWhen we talk about one and a half million missing African-American men, we\u2019re talking about missing husbands, missing fathers, missing brothers,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.Without naming Mrs. Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is expected to declare his candidacy for the Democratic nomination, bemoaned the overly punitive legislation of the Clinton era. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of rethinking of that type of legislation,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf for no other reason just financially it makes more sense to provide jobs and education than building jails.\u201d While elected officials had embraced the tough-on-crime approach decades before Mr. Clinton took office, the adult prison population after his signing of the law nearly doubled from the early 1990s to about 2.2 million prisoners today.Donald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention.\u201cWhat I read in Clinton\u2019s speech is a repudiation of the notion that more prisons and more punishment equals more safety,\u201d said Nicholas Turner, president and director of the Vera Institute of Justice.In her last presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton echoed the approach of the Bill Clinton years with a call to expand police forces to help cities halve the homicide rate. But she largely ceded issues of racial equality to Mr. Obama, who inspired Democrats with his seminal speech on race relations after divisive remarks by his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr.But on Wednesday Mrs. Clinton said it was \u201ca time for honesty about race and justice in America,\u201d and she displayed a personal connection to the issue.Mrs. Clinton had long planned to deliver remarks about urban policy and criminal justice at a forum hosted by former Mayor David N. Dinkins. But only after the situation in Baltimore flared did she focus those remarks on current events, according to a campaign aide.In her remarks, Mrs. Clinton echoed her broader campaign theme of tackling income inequality. She said the protests in Baltimore and Ferguson, Mo., were indelibly linked to an economy that disproportionately favors the wealthy and she delivered a populist lament that prosperity should be measured by strengthening families and communities and not Wall Street\u2019s measure of \u201cthe size of the bonuses handed out in downtown office buildings.\u201dMany of the 2016 contenders seemed either caught off guard or uncertain of how, or even whether, to respond to the situation in Baltimore. With few exceptions, the candidates first grappled with the city\u2019s turmoil from the safe distance of written statements released by aides or brief postings on social media.Reactions ranged from the personal to the doctrinaire, from compassionate to flippant. Former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley rushed back on Tuesday from paid speechmaking in Ireland to the West Baltimore neighborhood he once oversaw as mayor, seeming at once heartbroken and eager to project calm.Amid drum circles and hovering helicopters, Mr. O\u2019Malley spoke with city residents \u2014 some admiring, others not \u2014 at an intersection cater-corner to the burned-out CVS Pharmacy. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of good people in our city,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer arc of Baltimore, the longer arc of our history, is black and white people coming together to make a better life for themselves.\u201d\u201cThere has to be a commitment to the rule of law,\u201d he said of the rioters, but he insisted on an investigation into Mr. Gray\u2019s death \u201cas quickly as possible so that people know that the system works for them.Ben Carson, a former neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital seeking the Republican nomination, evoked his own time as a Baltimore resident, and denounced \u201cirresponsible individuals\u201d and \u201cuncontrolled agitators.\u201dJason Horowitz, Jeremy W.

{"Headline": "The Many Droughts of California", "Date": "2015-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMORRO BAY, Calif. \u2014 CALIFORNIA has only two seasons, rainy and dry. In March, when the rains stop \u2014 assuming they have begun \u2014 we must forget about precipitation for at least six months. The rainfall determines our mood for the summer and fall. Where I live, on the Central Coast, 17 inches of rain per winter has been the long-term average. Beating that number \u2014 we last did it five years ago \u2014 feels like winning the lottery. Lately, the average has been well under 10. The difference between a good rain year in California and a bad one depends on the number of storms blowing in from the Pacific. One or two storms a winter is bad; four to six, good. Even in wet, happy years, when we shrug off floods and mudslides, rain is intermittent. Storms soak the valleys and snow blankets the mountains for a day or two, but then follows a week or two of sun. During the dry times, where we find ourselves now, the long series of sunny days becomes a little scary. As of Wednesday, the water content of the snowpack in the Sierra range was lower than at any time since 1950. Relentless pumping of groundwater is causing farmland to sink in the Central Valley.As the drought enters its fourth year, the voluntary tightening of water use has failed to meet its goals. So this week Gov. Jerry Brown instituted mandatory restrictions. Cities and towns will have to cut their consumption by 25 percent, compared with 2013. But the state is so big and diverse that a dozen different droughts are in effect. Northern Californians, blessed with racing rivers, have relatively little to worry about, while around the megalopolis of Los Angeles, the water sources are remote and aqueducts are lifelines. Desert dwellers near Arizona and Nevada hardly perceive drought, while coastal residents like me take false comfort from the ocean and standby desalination plants. Yet all across the state, skirmishes over a shrinking resource are taking place. Having watched my neighbor wash his truck when he\u2019s not supposed to, now I\u2019ll be justified in turning him in. More of us will report violators to the city authorities \u2014 though perhaps without giving our names. If the drought continues, California\u2019s easygoing social compact may crack and wither, too.Although aqueducts crisscross the state, half of Californians draw water from local reservoirs and groundwater. Two communities facing each other across Morro Bay \u2014 my town and the younger, more ragged community of Los Osos \u2014 have adopted different approaches. About 20 years ago, we in Morro Bay paid for a pipeline to tap into what\u2019s called state water. That makes us dependent on someone else\u2019s allocations, but in a drought we are in better shape than Los Osos, which relies solely on groundwater. Under strain from overpumping, Los Osos aquifers are threatened by chemical pollution and saltwater intrusion from the ocean. Morro Bay has municipal wells as backup, and a desalination plant to filter brackish groundwater. We try not to be smug. About 30 miles inland, the city of Paso Robles is surrounded by ranches and vineyards. This picturesque, rolling country is a favorite of wine-tasting tourists. Unfortunately, the local reservoirs are below capacity and groundwater pumping has lowered the water table so that ranchers and landowners are finding that their wells are drying up. Vineyard owners, who are relative newcomers, not only take the bulk of the groundwater but also can afford deeper wells, so as to take more. Class warfare is beginning. Even forming a committee to review the problem has been divisive. The conflict looming the largest in the state is the one between urban and agricultural interests, but that mother of all battles, upheaving the economy, will not be fought unless the drought lasts several more years. Years ago when water rights in California were assigned, the cities and their industries were not as muscular and thirsty as they are today.The surface water for the big farms and dairy operations in the Central Valley is first transported from mountain reservoirs to the delta region, where the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers meet the fingers of San Francisco\u2019s East Bay. The delta also provides the water that town and city dwellers drink.Here is the home of the delta smelt, a 2-inch-long fish that has been caught up in water battles for a generation. By court order, the endangered smelt is entitled to a certain amount of river water, ahead of downstream users. Farmers in the Central Valley have blamed the smelt for cutting their allotments \u2014 and that\u2019s during the good years. Residential supplies haven\u2019t been affected by the smelt, so far as we\u2019ve noticed. Since the drought started, the fish has had fewer and fewer defenders. Recently, it might have done the state a favor by becoming what one biologist termed \u201cfunctionally extinct,\u201d because of an increasingly saline environment. If society writes off the smelt, who will inherit its portion of the water? Probate for the fish could be rancorous \u2014 a dry run, so to speak, for a much greater struggle to come. Perhaps we Californians have taken our bountiful natural resources too much for granted. Let\u2019s hope that nature doesn\u2019t settle the score. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Weak Growth Is Expected to Push Beijing Into Action", "Date": "2015-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s leaders are widely expected to cut interest rates and encourage lending after data on Wednesday showed that an industrial slump and a weak housing market had dragged economic growth to its slowest pace in six years.The question now is whether those steps will be enough to avert an even sharper slowdown.Key barometers of the country\u2019s economic health are looking gloomy. Industrial production in March increased at its slowest pace since late 2008, while retail sales, a sign of consumer demand, rose at the slowest rate in nearly a decade. Land purchases by developers, a major source of revenue for China\u2019s heavily indebted local governments, fell 32 percent in the first three months.\u201dThere certainly is pressure now, and the pressure on some sectors is quite heavy,\u201d China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, told a gathering of economists in Beijing on Tuesday, before the new growth figures were released.While acknowledging the pressures, Mr. Li continued, \u201dbut there is also impetus, and many businesses take a positive long-term view of this market,\u201d He added: \u201cOur toolbox still has many policy tools, and the biggest tool is reform.\u201dTraditionally, China\u2019s biggest and most effective policy tool has been ordering the state-controlled financial system to increase lending, which lifts investment that quickly translates into economic growth.But the overhauls Mr. Li mentioned are aimed at reducing this dependence on credit-fueled growth \u2014 which the consulting firm McKinsey estimates has pushed China\u2019s overall debt to as much as 282 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 and replacing it with an approach that relies on household demand. That transition will take time and, as the latest figures suggest, could be uncomfortable.\u201cChina can perhaps defer or elongate the slowdown in aggregate growth but not prevent it,\u201d George Magnus, a financial consultant and former chief economist at UBS, said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of what rebalancing requires \u2014 a downshift in the investment rate. But I\u2019m not sure the leadership is willing to swallow hard and let it happen.\u201dChina\u2019s Communist Party leadership has lowered its official growth target for this year to about 7 percent. That would be the nation\u2019s slowest annual expansion in 25 years. Policy makers are trying to manage the slowdown in a way that preserves job creation and keeps credit flowing to businesses. For the central bank, that means keeping monetary policy loose enough to fend off an increased risk of deflation, or falling prices, which could lead companies to reduce hiring and curtail investment.Since November, the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, has cut interest rates twice and given banks the freedom to lend more. Most economists expect it will further lower the amount of cash that banks must keep on reserve \u2014 a move that would also counter a trend in recent months of funds\u2019 flowing out of the country \u2014 and to cut interest rates again.These measures appear to be having an effect, with important short-term borrowing rates in China\u2019s money market, an important indicator of the real cost of funding for smaller banks and other financial institutions, falling to about 3 percent in the past week, down from about 5 percent in February.Haibin Zhu, the chief China economist at J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong, said he expected the central bank to take action in the next three months. \u201cBut is that sufficient to call it easing, or is it a delayed response \u2014 what in economic terms we call moving behind the curve?\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cProbably moving behind the curve, or at best staying on it.\u201dOther efforts to stimulate growth this year include significant government spending on infrastructure. Mr. Li, the Chinese premier, said in a speech last month that the government would spend over 800 billion renminbi, or about $130 billion, on new railroad lines this year and another 800 billion renminbi on major water conservation projects.\u201dMarch data does show that infrastructure investment accelerated, although it\u2019s not sufficient to offset the slowdown in manufacturing and real estate,\u201d Mr. Zhu said.China\u2019s housing market continues to struggle, with home prices falling and new construction starts declining. This has effects at home and abroad, including impacts on domestic steel production, pricing of imported iron ore from Australia and employment of sales agents at property brokerages across China.Foreign trade has been buffeted by lackluster overseas shipments and signs of even weaker demand at home. Exports of goods by value rose only 5 percent in the first three months of the year, while imports slumped 17 percent, weighed down by lower global prices for oil and other commodities.Sheng Laiyun, the spokesman for China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics, said that \u201cdownward pressure\u201d on the Chinese economy came from both external factors, including the tepid recovery of many economies, and domestic factors. New sources of growth were emerging, he said, \u201cbut in the short term, it\u2019s difficult for them to make up for the subsiding of traditional drivers.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The PayPal Mafia\u2019s Golden Touch", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial SectionThe ride-hailing app Uber, the apartment rental site Airbnb and other darlings of the next generation of Silicon Valley start-ups are reshaping the way people use the web. They are also changing expectations about just how much money private companies can raise while still staying out of the public markets. Known as the unicorns, these private technology companies are worth $1 billion or more, thanks to an influx of cash from venture capital firms, hedge funds, private equity firms and mutual funds. But alongside the Wall Street money flowing into these companies\u2019 coffers, a familiar set of names is operating behind the scenes by advising, investing in and, in some cases, founding the unicorns. The PayPal Mafia \u2014 a nickname given a group of alumni of PayPal, the payments company that went public in 2002 and was acquired by eBay \u2014 has its hands in many, if not most, of today\u2019s most valuable private tech companies. Their enduring influence, more than a decade after they made their first fortunes, speaks to the tightknit social fabric of Silicon Valley\u2019s technology industry, and to the trust new entrepreneurs place in those who have succeeded before them. And now, the PayPal group\u2019s close ties with the current crop of unicorns \u2014 a collection of some of the most valuable technology start-ups ever seen \u2014 suggest its influence is undiminished. Peter Thiel, a co-founder and former chief executive of PayPal, is an investor in companies including Airbnb, the big-data company Palantir, the spaceflight provider SpaceX and the payments company Stripe, four of the most valuable tech companies in Silicon Valley today. Jeremy Stoppelman, the former vice president for engineering at PayPal, has personally invested in the payments provider Square, Uber, Pinterest, Airbnb and Palantir. And Keith Rabois, the former head of business development at PayPal who is now a partner at Khosla Ventures, holds shares in Airbnb, Stripe and Palantir, to name a few.The shared experience of PayPal alumni makes their advice \u2014 and money \u2014 particularly valuable to young entrepreneurs. An online payments provider founded in the 1990s, the company succeeded despite going public shortly after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, even as the economy was still reeling from both the attack and the collapse of the dot-com bubble. \u201cPayPal was an extreme experience in survival against all odds, over and over again, with enormous and lasting success,\u201d said Max Levchin, PayPal\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer. \u201cLike veterans of an intense military campaign, we fall back on lessons learned, and relationships established in our early 20s.\u201dAfter PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002, the alumni of PayPal emerged as among the few willing to invest in new tech start-ups.\u201cWe went from this bunch of misfits to the center of the ecosystem,\u201d Mr. Rabois said. \u201cEntrepreneurs needed capital, and the only place to get the capital was from us.\u201dEven as the members of the alumni group have gone on to found new companies and take roles at venture capital funds, they have continued to invest in each other\u2019s companies and in new entrepreneurs. \u201cThere\u2019s a vicarious reliving of our old experience by working with new young teams,\u201d said Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital who was head of business development at PayPal and has invested in Square. \u201cThe surest path to dementia is to stop working when you\u2019re young.\u201dPart of the reason this small cabal of friends \u2014 all men, mostly white, under the age of 50 \u2014 remains at the center of the action in Silicon Valley is that, among the entrepreneurial elite, success begets success. \u201cThere\u2019s a network effect to these things,\u201d said Mr. Stoppelman, who today is chief executive of Yelp, the user review site he co-founded. \u201cIf you have a name that\u2019s associated with success, people will seek you out. Why do smart people go to Harvard? Because previous smart people went to Harvard.\u201d Or in this case, entrepreneurs want PayPal alumni to invest in their start-ups, because PayPal alumni have invested in previously successful entrepreneurs. For more than a decade, the PayPal group has been integral to the founding or financing of many of the best-known start-ups, making them even richer in the process. Mr. Thiel, who now runs venture and hedge funds, was one of the earliest investors in Facebook. Several PayPal alumni invested in Yammer, which was acquired by Microsoft for $1.2 billion in 2012. Yammer was also founded by a former PayPal executive, David Sacks, PayPal\u2019s former chief operating officer. And indeed, the group has not only funded many of today\u2019s successful technology companies but also has continued to create them. Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists try to resist Wall Street\u2019s entreaties, but a new relationship has lead to new fund-raising methods.LinkedIn, now worth $32 billion, was co-founded by Reid Hoffman, another former PayPal chief operating officer. Mr. Stoppelman and another PayPal alum, Russell Simmons, co-founded Yelp, now worth $3.5 billion. And Elon Musk, who co-founded the company that became PayPal, subsequently started Tesla, worth $23 billion, and SpaceX, a unicorn valued at $12 billion. Even YouTube, acquired by Google for $1.6 billion in 2006, was founded by three PayPal alum: Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim. \u201cWe have a very good collective r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d said Scott Banister, a former PayPal board member, explaining the sustained influence of the group. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that you\u2019re associated with the company, it\u2019s that you\u2019re associated with the other people associated with the company.\u201dAfter leaving PayPal, Mr. Banister co-founded an email service, IronPort, which he sold to Cisco Systems for $830 million. Investing in new entrepreneurs today allows these seasoned veterans of the technology scene to stay close to the ground, where new entrepreneurs are trying to bootstrap their way to fortune and fame.Mr. Levchin sold a social gaming company, Slide, to Google in 2010. He recently started a payments company, Affirm, backed by several former colleagues. \u201cAt Yelp, every time it was time for a funding round, Peter Thiel was my go-to adviser,\u201d Mr. Stoppelman said. \u201cWhen it came to thinking about the product and growth strategies, Max was my day-to-day. For broad thinking, I would go to Keith.\u201dBut investing in start-ups is inherently risky. While PayPal alumni have managed to back several big winners, the specter of failure always looms large. \u201cAnytime I write an angel check I say, \u2018This is probably the last time I will see this money,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Stoppelman said. \u201cIt hurts just as much to lose $25,000 as it would to lose $1 million.\u201d For now, however, the collective r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the PayPal Mafia is largely unblemished.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Chicago\u2019s Reshaped Politics, Unions Are Divided Over Mayoral Race", "Date": "2015-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 An exuberant crowd that included public-school teachers, union bus drivers and nursing home workers packed into New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church on this city\u2019s West Side on Saturday afternoon as Karen Lewis, the president of the Chicago Teachers Union, issued an urgent plea. \u201cI am asking you, I am begging you, and \u2014 in my teacher voice \u2014 I am telling you, go vote,\u201d Ms. Lewis, who wore a \u201cChuy\u201d button on each lapel, called out, as a cheer rose through the high-ceilinged church. \u201cGo vote!\u201d she called out again. \u201cGo vote!\u201dAt the heart of the campaign that has threatened to topple Mayor Rahm Emanuel are labor unions: Amalgamated Transit Union locals, the Service Employees International Union\u2019s Illinois State Council and, perhaps above all, the Chicago Teachers Union. Jesus G. Garcia, the candidate known as Chuy, built his campaign on the backing of teachers, has received his strongest financial support from unions and was talked into running by Ms. Lewis herself. And the crowd inside this echoing church followed orders, scores of people streaming out together and marching down Madison Street to a polling location with less than an hour remaining for early voting in advance of Tuesday\u2019s election.For decades, this city\u2019s elections were dominated by a Democratic political machine \u2014 armies of patronage government workers who could be counted on to get their neighbors out to vote. But a series of legal decrees and anticorruption investigations as recently as a decade ago have dismantled that reliable political muscle in many wards, raising a question that rarely had to be asked around here: How exactly do you win an election in Chicago anymore?Mr. Emanuel, who has raised more than $18 million, far more than his opponent, has blitzed the airwaves, which may help explain a Chicago Tribune poll last week that suggested he had opened a substantive lead. And Mr. Emanuel\u2019s campaign is running a sophisticated field organization in the neighborhoods, including on-the-ground help, office space and phone calls by supportive aldermen. Some aides say the operation has ramped up significantly since six weeks ago, when it was not enough to capture more than 50 percent of the vote, forcing the city\u2019s first runoff election since it began holding nonpartisan mayor\u2019s contests 16 years ago.Mr. Garcia has turned to a handful of independent progressive groups, but mainly to organized labor, which was out in force across the city over the weekend knocking on doors, holding phone banks, gathering lists of volunteers for Election Day and arranging rides to the polls. \u201cThis being the first runoff we\u2019ve ever had, there is no model to go on,\u201d said Ricardo Mu\u00f1oz, a city alderman who backed Mr. Garcia and said he saw labor as an important piece of a larger puzzle for winning votes here now. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to invent the wheel here.\u201dWho Rahm Emanuel needs to win over to keep his seat in the April 7 runoff.Less understood, though, is that labor is by no means speaking with one voice in this race. Mr. Emanuel has his own cast of union backers, more than 70 locals among 15 unions, which he proudly listed in an interview. Among them: firefighters, hospitality workers, carpenters, painters, laborers, pipe fitters and plumbers.\u201cIn a postmachine world, they matter a lot,\u201d a top Emanuel campaign strategist said of unions. \u201cThey\u2019re a huge piece of our campaign strategy.\u201d Notably, the Tribune poll found Mr. Emanuel with 47 percent support of union households and Mr. Garcia with 39 percent \u2014 although the difference lies within the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error.The split in labor has come as a shock to some of Mr. Emanuel\u2019s sharpest critics, who view him as an anti-union mayor whose clashes with teachers were so intense that they called the city\u2019s first schools strike in a quarter-century, and whose efforts to require some city workers to pay more for pension benefits and to reduce the size of benefit increases were seen as a shot across the bow. Mr. Emanuel\u2019s history did not help. Union leaders here frequently recall his role in helping win approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s.Jim Sweeney, the president of Local 150 of the International Union of Operating Engineers, said his group was among those that endorsed Mr. Emanuel\u2019s opponent when he first ran for mayor in 2011. Over the weekend, though, his union was working on behalf of Mr. Emanuel, holding phone banks and get-out-the-vote canvasses in an effort to reach 147,000 voters in union households.\u201cIt really just is about how he evolved over the last four years,\u201d said Mr. Sweeney, who four years ago sharply criticized Mr. Emanuel over his part in Nafta. He said Mr. Emanuel had negotiated with his union over proposed pension changes and, at another point, agreed to standards for cranes that suited his workers\u2019 safety concerns. \u201cFor us, the discussion just came back to: The economy is doing good in the city, and the mayor\u2019s done the right things.\u201dSeveral other prominent union groups, including the Chicago Federation of Labor and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, have stayed neutral. And the election led to a split among Service Employees International Union groups, with leaders of one local filing a complaint against another after it provided help to Mr. Garcia though the union\u2019s state council had, at the time, chosen to stay neutral. After the election in February and meetings with both candidates, the state council changed its mind and threw its official backing to Mr. Garcia, though not every local agreed.\u201cPatronage was a system that really gave politicians a built-in political operation,\u201d said Tom Balanoff, the president of the state council as well as the union\u2019s Local 1, which includes janitors, food service workers and security officers. \u201cIn that sense, none of the politicians have an operation anymore. Who fills that void? There\u2019s not many institutions that can. We can.\u201dYet without a unified voice, strategists here said, labor\u2019s role may go only so far on Tuesday \u2014 with get-out-the-vote efforts from pro-Garcia unions potentially canceled out by similar efforts from pro-Emanuel unions. \u201cLabor is never stronger than when it\u2019s unified,\u201d said Anders Lindall, a spokesman for Afscme Council 31.In a largely Latino neighborhood on the city\u2019s Southwest Side, canvassers from the Service Employees International Union walked door to door through a bitter wind on Friday afternoon, urging voters they had identified as likely to support Mr. Garcia to vote early.

{"Headline": "After Shift in Nigeria, Entrenched-Party Rule Faces Test Elsewhere in Africa", "Date": "2015-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisJOHANNESBURG \u2014 The historic election results last week in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous nation and biggest economy, drew worldwide praise and stirred hopes of a democratic domino effect on the rest of the continent.If an incumbent president could step down willingly, and power could be transferred peacefully from one party to another in Nigeria \u2014 with its history of military coups and deadly ethnic and religious rivalries, not to mention a raging Islamist insurgency \u2014 why wouldn\u2019t the same happen elsewhere?In the last two decades, incumbents have lost elections and peacefully handed over power to the opposition in about 10 other African countries, mostly smaller nations like Senegal, Benin, Zambia and Malawi.\u201cGiven Nigeria\u2019s size and the direct influence it exercises on neighboring states, it does make far more respectable and acceptable in elite circles the idea of a change,\u201d said Steven Friedman, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg. \u201cWe have to see what happens, but from that perspective, the way in which it\u2019s happened has been significant.\u201d\u201cBut is it going to persuade the generals in Zimbabwe to stop doing what they\u2019re doing?\u201d he added. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201dAmid the accolades for Nigeria last week came a development on the other side of the continent, one more in keeping with the practice of clinging to power.In recent months, supporters of President Paul Kagame of Rwanda \u2014 who exercises outsized influence in Africa as a darling of Western governments, international donors and investors \u2014 have started a media campaign clamoring for constitutional change that would permit him to run for a third term in 2017.Similar efforts are underway in a handful of other countries, including two of Rwanda\u2019s immediate neighbors, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi.Only two days after Mr. Jonathan conceded defeat in Nigeria \u2014 publicly telling his long-dominant party that it \u201cshould be celebrating rather than mourning\u201d because it had \u201cestablished a legacy of democratic freedom\u201d \u2014 Mr. Kagame gave the clearest indication yet that he would be open to staying in power beyond the two terms allowed by his county\u2019s Constitution.\u201cThose who think the president should continue, they should convince me,\u201d Mr. Kagame said on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m not asking anybody to change the Constitution.\u201dAcross the continent, there are equally powerful trends and countertrends, making it difficult to say precisely what Nigeria\u2019s impact will be.Some analysts cautioned that Nigeria\u2019s election outcome could be regarded as less of a genuine democratic transfer than a reshuffling of the country\u2019s historical power brokers.The newly elected president, Muhammadu Buhari, is a former general who once served as Nigeria\u2019s military ruler after coming to power in a coup. The first president of Nigeria after the return to democracy in 1999 was also a retired general and former military ruler of the country, Olusegun Obasanjo.Mr. Buhari\u2019s political party, the All Progressives Congress, was established after three opposition parties formed an alliance in 2013 with the view of challenging Mr. Jonathan in 2015. Mr. Jonathan\u2019s Peoples Democratic Party had held power since 1999, and it is almost certain that many within his party opposed his decision to concede quickly to Mr. Buhari.Some see in that concession \u2014 and the possible emergence in Nigeria of a real two-party system \u2014 a sign of political maturity in the continent. They also see it as a challenge to other African nations \u2014 including the other African giant, South Africa \u2014 that are effectively one-party democracies.Commenting on the transfer of power between political parties in Nigeria, John Robbie, a popular radio talk show host here, said, \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate test of a democracy, and we\u2019re not there yet.\u201dThe African National Congress has governed South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994, though it has lost regional elections, including in the Western Cape, the province containing Cape Town.At the national level, the A.N.C.\u2019s share of support has declined in every election in the last two decades, though experts believe that its hold on power is secure for at least the next two to three election cycles.Alfredo Tjiurimo Hengari, an expert on African foreign policy at the South African Institute of International Affairs, said that even with its recent transfer of power, Nigeria lacks the kind of strong civil society and domestic democratic institutions that hold South Africa\u2019s government more accountable.Few doubt that the A.N.C. will peacefully accept an eventual loss of power nationally, just as it has in more local elections, he said.\u201cIf Nigeria provides the big bang, there have been smaller shifts in South Africa that have socialized the A.N.C. to the possibility of losing power at some point,\u201d Mr. Hengari said.Voters have overwhelmingly backed the dominant governing parties in other one-party democracies, including Namibia and Botswana, in recent elections.In addition, Mr. Hengari said, the governing parties in the one-party democracies \u2014 not to mention more authoritarian governments, like Zimbabwe\u2019s \u2014 are unlikely to feel threatened by the loss of Nigeria\u2019s Peoples Democratic Party.Though Nigeria\u2019s party governed continuously for 16 years, it lacked the historical legitimacy of other dominant parties, like the A.N.C., which played central roles in liberating their nations from colonial rule.\u201cI don\u2019t think for South Africa the lessons from Nigeria are of a democratic nature,\u201d Mr. Hengari said. \u201cIt\u2019s one where South Africa says, \u2018Well, it\u2019s good to see Nigeria stabilizing democratically.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rhode Island Settles Lawsuit on Union Pension Overhaul", "Date": "2015-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 Rhode Island and most of its public employee unions reached a tentative settlement Thursday to a sweeping legal challenge to the state\u2019s 2011 overhaul of its beleaguered pension system.The settlement, which affects 59,000 current and past state employees, modifies the overhaul by providing adjustments to the minimum retirement age, the chance for more frequent cost-of-living increases and an increase in the defined-benefit pensions available to longtime public employees. It still must be approved by the General Assembly.Six of the nine unions that sued the state agreed to the settlement, but the three unions that have not settled represent about 800 employees; their challenge will be addressed by the court after the settlement is implemented. But a trial scheduled to begin this month has been averted.The settlement also relieves the new governor, Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, of what could have been a financial and political albatross as she seeks to revive Rhode Island\u2019s struggling economy; as the state\u2019s former general treasurer, she was the chief architect of the pension overhaul under challenge.\u201cThe state had a very strong case,\u201d Ms. Raimondo said Thursday. But, she said, \u201cto take the litigation risk off of the table is the right thing to do.\u201d The settlement gives financial certainty to employees and retirees, she said, and is affordable for taxpayers.\u201cAll of the structural elements of the original pension legislation remain intact,\u201d she said, adding that those elements provide \u201ca fundamental restructuring of the system and fundamentally puts the system in a much healthier position.\u201dThe $14.8 billion pension system, on the brink of collapse, was overhauled in 2011 and again in 2012. The legislature created a hybrid plan that split direct contributions between the state and employees. It also suspended cost-of-living adjustments and raised the retirement age by five years, measures intended to save $4 billion over 20 years.But the changes infuriated the public employee unions, which challenged the overhaul as unconstitutional and worked against Ms. Raimondo\u2019s candidacy last year for governor. She eked out a victory anyway and is widely seen as having established a template for other states and municipalities to follow as they face their own fiscal issues.Frank Shafroth, the director of the Center for State and Local Government Leadership at George Mason University, said the settlement appeared to be good for Rhode Island, \u201cbecause not agreeing to it means the long-term problem gets worse.\u201dPart of the problem for pension systems across the country is that employees are living longer than in previous generations, Mr. Shafroth said, so settlements like this are going to become more necessary. He added that he regarded the Rhode Island settlement \u201cas a very constructive development.\u201dRoger Boudreau, who leads the Rhode Island Public Employees\u2019 Retiree Coalition, told The Associated Press that retirees would not be happy with the settlement because they were getting \u201ca fraction\u201d of what they were promised. But, he added, they knew their chances of prevailing at trial were \u201cvery slim at best.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Questions About Airbnb\u2019s Responsibility After Attack by Dog", "Date": "2015-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyOn Airbnb\u2019s short and startling ride to global ubiquity, it has delighted many people. Hosts can rent rooms or their entire home and use the income to avoid having a day job, to make ends meet or to get into the bed-and-breakfast business without bothering with local licensing rules or all the usual red tape.Travelers get to express their displeasure with local hotels and their sky-high prices and double-digit taxes. Plus, they can stay in residential neighborhoods or rural areas where inns might not exist.By the time the dog was through with his arm, he had suffered a six-square-inch gash and a handful of puncture wounds. When he first contacted Airbnb, it declined to cover his two-night hospital stay, or do much of anything else besides refund the money for his aborted stay.And so it goes in the so-called sharing economy, where companies create a market for others to sell rides and rent rooms, while wrapping themselves in shiny-happy hero capes. But when it comes right down to it, what the companies share most of all is risk, even if the chance of grievous injury is relatively low.All this is irrelevant for Mr. Silverman, however, since Airbnb\u2019s new liability coverage doesn\u2019t extend outside the United States. Over the last year, he and his wife have driven from Alaska to the bottom of South America, trying to stick to a budget of $100 a day.The pair have stayed in about 20 Airbnb properties without incident over the years. They tend to look for ones with kitchens and decent Wi-Fi, and they carefully examine reviews written by previous guests. That\u2019s how they found a place in Salta, in the far northwest of Argentina, for about $60 a night. Airbnb said on Thursday that it pulled down the listing after the canine attack.Quite often, a host\u2019s Airbnb listing will make no mention of a pet. The Salta listing and reviews didn\u2019t mention the fact, and in the first couple of days that Mr. Silverman and his wife stayed at the property, the dog never barked or growled or moved much, despite plenty of activity near the building, according to Mr. Silverman.Which is why he was shocked when he stuck his hand out to the dog for a sniff a few days into his Salta stay, only to have the dog leap and clamp its jaw on his arm.In some respects, Mr. Silverman was lucky. He has a plate in his forearm from a motorcycle accident, and he believes that when the dog\u2019s teeth hit the plate, it loosened its grip momentarily to try to bite again. At that point, he was able to get away.\u201cI looked down, and I knew instantly it was bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI could see my artery, the tendons exposed and the muscle. There was blood everywhere.\u201dAt the hospital, the couple was required to pay a deposit before he could be admitted for the night, and the owner of the flat could not provide it, so the couple had to come up with the cash. The immediate medical concern was the risk of infection, which tends to be higher in older bite victims. Ten days after the attack, some of the wounds still had not yet closed completely.Mr. Silverman may have rattled Airbnb in his request to be reimbursed for his medical bills and additional lodging costs \u2014 compensation beyond the original room refund the company offered. He wrote in an email to Airbnb: \u201cThere is also a pain and suffering element as well as, perhaps, permanent nerve damage. Have you ever been attacked by a large dog? When I close my eyes at night, I see this thing tearing at my arm and blood everywhere \u2014 which is exactly what happened.\u201dBut Airbnb\u2019s initial email responses politely turned him away. \u201cPlease understand our refund was an attempt to soften the impact of an unfortunate accident and to provide our best possible customer service to you,\u201d one said. \u201cUnfortunately, per our terms of service, we are unable to consider any request for compensation in liability scenario such as this.\u201d Then it went on to say how much the company valued him as a guest and wished him well in his recovery.The response, however, changed right after I inquired on his behalf, with the company then asking for his medical bills and the receipts for his lodging expenses.Nick Papas, an Airbnb spokesman, added the following in an email: \u201cOver 30 million guests have stayed on Airbnb, and these kinds of incidents are incredibly rare, but when they happen, we try to make things right. This was a terrible incident, and we\u2019re working with the guest to help cover his medical and other expenses and we\u2019ve provided a full refund.\u201dMr. Silverman respects a fair bit of what Airbnb has accomplished. He spent years as a technology and strategy consultant, and he\u2019s enough of a student of the world to see how much economic opportunity the site creates for many hosts in countries with low average incomes. He\u2019s also aware of what he refers to as the Latin American view of liability, which is that bad things sometimes happen to people, and there\u2019s not much you can do about it when they do.But less experienced Americans and Europeans may not know about these attitudes, or the possible lack of insurance in many countries when they make their reservations.Instead, they take comfort in the Airbnb brand, all of the company\u2019s positive press and the fact that it usually provides happy experiences. All the more reason then, in Mr. Silverman\u2019s opinion, for the company to provide some kind of insurance backstop all over the world.Mr. Silverman wanted to know how many accidents have happened at Airbnb-listed properties. I\u2019ve asked the company for this information before and gotten nowhere, and the same thing was true this time. So we don\u2019t know how many other dog bites have occurred, and we don\u2019t know whether travelers have died of carbon monoxide poisoning, say, in illegally converted hostels.Mr. Papas of Airbnb did say that the company was seeking to expand its host liability coverage to other countries. Until that happens the world over, here\u2019s hoping that the company\u2019s quick change of heart in Mr. Silverman\u2019s case reflects a determination to pay claims for serious injuries without the injured having to put up a fight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon: 2 British Postwar Greats Coming Back to Auction", "Date": "2015-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s have revealed that over the next few months they are selling highly desirable works by Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud, the two unquestionable greats of British postwar painting. But it doesn\u2019t look as though a new wave of Britons who have been given early access to their retirement funds will be spending much money at the art sales this summer. Private collections assembled in the 1960s and \u201970s, before the cult of investing in art fully took hold, often have a distinctive character. Expressing the taste of their individual owners, rather than hired advisers, the collections of personalities such as the art critic and curator David Sylvester and Robert Sainsbury, of the grocery store fortune, reflect an engagement, eclecticism and intellectual curiosity worlds away from the calculated box-ticking that characterizes so much of today\u2019s conspicuous art consumption.In its private viewing room in London last week, Sotheby\u2019s put a group of some 20 works on show that were a reminder of that lost age of collecting.\u201cIt\u2019s a snapshot of a time that has stood the test of time,\u201d said Oliver Barker, Sotheby\u2019s senior international specialist in contemporary art. \u201cThey had a passion for combining a number of collecting categories.\u201dSotheby\u2019s sale of Impressionist and modern works in London on June 24 will include Henry Moore\u2019s \u201cTwo Women and a Child,\u201d an imposing and previously unshown 1948 gouache and watercolor estimated at \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3400,000. A terra-cotta altar head from the Benin Kingdom, in what is now Nigeria, is valued at $400,000 to $600,000 in the May 15 auction of African, Oceanic and Pre-Columbian Art in New York. Not one of the works has been guaranteed a minimum price by Sotheby\u2019s, Mr. Barker said.When asked whether he thought it was a shame that the collection could not be put up for sale in a single auction, Mr. Barker said, \u201cThere just weren\u2019t enough lots to support a single evening sale.\u201d\u201cThey were collectors who didn\u2019t buy too many things,\u201d he added, \u201cand nothing was kept in storage.\u201d Lucian Freud\u2019s \u201cBig Sue\u201d returns to Christie\u2019s on May 13, with the auction house offering another portrait from the painter\u2019s famous \u201cBenefits Supervisor\u201d series during its postwar and contemporary art sales in New York. Seven years ago, at the height of the last art-market boom, Christie\u2019s sold Freud\u2019s monumental 1995 \u201cBenefits Supervisor Sleeping\u201d for $33.6 million to the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. Up for sale next month will be \u201cBenefits Supervisor Resting,\u201d from 1994, one of four nude studies of Sue Tilley, an amply proportioned local government officer, that Freud made over a three-year period, beginning in 1993. It will carry an estimated price tag of $30 million to $50 million. This 1.6-meter-by-1.5-meter, or roughly 5-feet-by-5-feet, depiction of Ms. Tilley sitting on a battered sofa with her head thrown back is owned by the Boston collector and philanthropist Barbara Lee. It was acquired at an exhibition of Freud paintings held by Acquavella Galleries in New York in 1995. Freud later said sales of these works to Acquavella had helped him pay off his long-standing gambling debts. Ms. Lee has been guaranteed an undisclosed minimum price by Christie\u2019s, which is exhibiting the thickly worked canvas at its London location until April 23. The work was previously on show in Hong Kong.\u201cThis will be a good test of where his market is going,\u201d said James Holland- Hibbert, a London dealer who held a loan exhibition of Freud\u2019s early works in 2008. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if this style of painting appeals to the buyers who support these sales. Is Freud still a big enough brand?\u201dThis month, about 7.5 million of Britain\u2019s retirees will be able to cash in some or all of their pension savings and spend the money on whatever they want. The British government\u2019s new \u201cfreedom and choice in pensions\u201d measures are expected to result in an estimated 200,000 individuals cashing in their entire \u201cdefined contribution\u201d retirement savings this year, which could bring a tax windfall of as much as \u00a31.6 billion for the Treasury, according to a report published in October by the British investment brokerage Hargreaves Lansdown. Analysts at Hargreaves Lansdown predict that the added income could inject as much as \u00a36 billion into the British economy in 2015. The median pension pot is valued at \u00a329,000, they said. The question is: Will any of this money be spent on art?\u201cI\u2019m not aware of anyone putting two and two together at all,\u201d said Christopher Battiscombe, director general of the Society of London Art Dealers, the trade body for London\u2019s top-end galleries. According to a survey of retirees conducted by the firm Ipsos Mori for Hargreaves Lansdown, few Britons view art as an \u201calternative investment,\u201d or even something worth buying at all. Of the 1,247 adults surveyed, who were aged 45 to 65 and living in Britain, more than half cited more prosaic uses for their cashed-in pensions: to cover everyday living expenses, pay for vacations or re-invest in property. \u201cThere aren\u2019t going to be many people flashing their cash on art and antiques, vintage wines and classic cars,\u201d said Paul Viney, chairman of Woolley & Wallis, an auction house based in Salisbury, England, that in recent years has sold seven lots of Asian art for more than \u00a31 million. \u201cYou don\u2019t get an income from art and antiques, and no one really knows what people will be buying in 20 years\u2019 time,\u201d Mr. Viney said.The popular success of British television programs such as the former BBC show \u201cCash in the Attic\u201d and the current BBC series \u201cFlog It!\u201d suggests that most Britons now regard art and antiques simply as things to sell. They leave the buying, Mr. Battiscombe suggested, to those who \u201cdon\u2019t have to free up their personal pensions to buy art.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Nigeria\u2019s Former Dictator Become a Democrat?", "Date": "2015-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn most countries, a 72-year-old retired general who once led a severe military dictatorship that imprisoned its opponents without trial, publicly executed convicts by firing squad, arrested journalists who criticized it, ran an Orwellian intelligence apparatus that bugged the phones of government ministers \u2014 a man whose overthrow three decades ago was welcomed with relief by his countrymen, and who lost three consecutive presidential elections in 12 years \u2014 would be considered unelectable.Not in Nigeria.As a military ruler, Mr. Buhari\u2019s uncompromising temperament invited opposition. He quickly dissipated the tremendous good will that greeted his entrance into government by simultaneously picking fights with, rather than bargaining with, powerful opponents and the media, and trying to impose military discipline on those he governed.How then has Mr. Buhari managed to rehabilitate himself and return to power, and what can we expect from Buhari 2.0? Some believe that Nigerians are the most forgiving people in the world toward their leaders because the bar for conduct of public officials has been set so low. However, there are more elaborate reasons for Mr. Buhari\u2019s rehabilitation.More than 70 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population is under 30 years old and thus too young to remember his time as a military leader. It is no coincidence that support for Mr. Buhari is most zealous among young people.There is also a sense of unfinished business. Mr. Buhari\u2019s supporters think his tenure as a military leader was a missed opportunity and that the country may have been spared many years of corruption had his ruthless anticorruption campaign not been prematurely ended.A university professor who worked for the Buhari government in the 1980s once told me that Nigeria \u201cwould have been a different country today\u201d had Mr. Buhari\u2019s military regime been allowed to govern for five years rather than the 20 months he ruled before he was overthrown in a palace coup. Many Nigerians who cheered his downfall back then now read lurid expos\u00e9s of government corruption and recall that era with nostalgia.Nigerian soldiers I\u2019ve interviewed believe that Mr. Buhari will fight it out with insurgents in a battlefield slugfest. However, those who expect him to be the same blood-and-thunder general he was 30 years ago are in for a surprise.Boko Haram will find Mr. Buhari a far more formidable opponent than the outgoing president, Goodluck Jonathan \u2014 not so much because of Mr. Buhari\u2019s military background, but rather because of his personal and political links to northeastern Nigeria, where the Boko Haram insurgency rages.During the mid-1970s, Mr. Buhari was the governor of Borno State \u2014 the northeastern state hit hardest by Boko Haram attacks. He later fought there as a military officer, and his grandfather came from the same Kanuri ethnic group to which most Boko Haram members belong. He will bring a great deal of local knowledge and a personal stake in the conflict that Mr. Jonathan did not have.Mr. Buhari has identified three fundamental problems to tackle: insecurity, corruption and the economy. These are the same issues he faced when he was Nigeria\u2019s military ruler. The question is what he will do this time to address them differently.In order to succeed, he must learn from what happened to him in 1985. Back then, his military colleagues were horrified to learn that they were not immune to his anticorruption investigations and were spooked when the National Security Organization wiretapped their phones, looking for evidence of financial impropriety. His alarmed colleagues organized an internal military coup and overthrew him in August 1985.Can a man renowned for being uncompromising and rigid resolve issues that require tactical adroitness and pragmatic flexibility?There are signs that he has learned to work with opponents. His party is a coalition of former government ministers, multiple opposition parties and even his former political rivals. Although Nigerians expect another war on corruption from Mr. Buhari, a big test will be whether he will have the courage to once again rock the boat by investigating powerful members of his own government who have been tainted by corruption allegations.If he launches an all-out anticorruption drive with no sacred cows, his popularity with the electorate will soar, but he will also step on toes powerful enough to trip him up and topple him from power. If he decides to be selective and navigate his war on corruption around powerful vested interests, he may avoid a power struggle, but will erode his credibility with the public.Nigerians should hope he is a changed man, one who will find a way to tackle the country\u2019s intense corruption and security challenges without amplifying the insurgency or triggering a political crisis and power struggle.Nigeria today needs a reconstructive surgeon, not a bulldozer.Advertisement"}

Political allegiances among these clans seem to shift as often as the tides, giving a soap opera quality to the nation\u2019s politics.The central character in this spectacle is the former president, Mohamed Nasheed, whose political activism and years in prison catalyzed a democracy movement that eventually allowed him in 2008 to defeat the longtime autocrat Maumoon Abdul Gayoom to become the Maldives\u2019 first democratically elected president.Mr. Nasheed became internationally famous in 2009 when he held an underwater cabinet meeting to highlight the dangers of climate change and was celebrated in a popular documentary, \u201cThe Island President.\u201d But his popularity at home suffered when he ordered the military to arrest a judge he accused of acting on behalf of Mr. Gayoom. Mr. Nasheed resigned amid the uproar his action caused.Mr. Nasheed soon claimed his resignation was coerced and labeled the transfer of power to his vice president a coup, but foreign governments and much of the country\u2019s populace \u2014 exhausted by a series of controversies during his administration \u2014 accepted the change. In 2013, he appeared poised for a possible comeback, but the Supreme Court repeatedly ruled to cancel results or delay voting in ways that favored Abdulla Yameen, half brother of Mr. Gayoom, who eventually won.Mr. Nasheed might have faded into history if not for the prosecution of him on terrorism charges that concluded last month in a 13-year prison sentence. Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, described the proceeding as \u201ca rushed process that appears to contravene the Maldives\u2019 own laws and practices and international fair trial standards in a number of respects.\u201d Government officials said the terrorism charges were related to the judge\u2019s detention.Another widely criticized case, this one of Mohamed Nazim, the former defense minister, which led to an 11-year sentence on weapons charges later in the month, has convinced many in the Maldives that Mr. Yameen is behind the prosecutions.\u201cThe president is going after each one of his popular rivals,\u201d said Ahmed Mahloof, a member of Parliament who recently left the governing party in protest.The man widely suspected of carrying out a campaign of intimidation against opponents of the government by using the courts and gangs is the tourism minister, Ahmed Adeeb. In an hourlong interview, he cheerfully agreed that he had been accused by many of vast corruption, violent reprisals and the murder of a journalist. Mr. Adeeb, 32, denied all of the myriad accusations leveled at him, saying, for instance, that embezzlement charges stemmed from a misunderstanding.\u201cBut they can never get me angry,\u201d Mr. Adeeb said, chuckling, of his accusers. \u201cWhatever they say, I will answer with a smile.\u201d\u201cThat the tourism minister controls all the gangs is an open secret,\u201d said Eva Abdulla, an opposition member of Parliament. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just the money he pays. It\u2019s also that if they go in prison, the tourism minister with one phone call will get them out.\u201dBut diplomats who watch the situation closely say Mr. Yameen and his top officials are becoming increasingly autocratic and unpredictable.\u201cThe government\u2019s game plan is to intimidate its opponents, send them to jail and tire them out,\u201d said one top Indian official who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cWill that work? Will people become restive? Can they also do development? Things are precarious.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Gap Between Auto Dealers and Social Media", "Date": "2015-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsIn January, marketing managers at Hyundai\u2019s American headquarters in Southern California persuaded Mr. Howell to give social media a more serious try. They asked him to use new software to post videos, photos and text updates suggested by the company on Facebook, Twitter and other social networks.Two months into his social media experiment, the efforts had drawn such little reaction that Mr. Howell, 42, decided to drop out of the program.Although he plans to keep posting photos of happy buyers on Facebook and encouraging them to write reviews, he does not have much use for the rest of it \u2014 especially since Hyundai began charging $275 a month for the service.To Mr. Howell, selling a car boils down to one basic principle: Treat your customers well, and they will sing your praises to friends and family. \u201cThose personal relationships are more important,\u201d he said.Nowhere is that gulf more apparent than in the auto industry. Car manufacturers including Hyundai and Ford Motor have embraced social media and spend tens of millions of dollars on sophisticated marketing campaigns. Yet many of their local dealers barely maintain a Facebook page.Some experts question whether local businesses even need to be active on social media.Still, if a business does plunge into social media, Facebook and outside experts said, the most reliable route to success is to pay to promote posts as ads \u2014 something that Hyundai is not yet teaching its dealers.\u201cIf you want predictable results for your business, ads are a cost-effective way to get them,\u201d said Dan Levy, Facebook\u2019s global director of small business.He said that the three-year program had just begun and that it was too soon to judge the results.Many local dealers worry that they need to be on Facebook, Twitter and whatever comes next, even as they struggle to understand how the services can help sell cars.\u201cIt\u2019s easier to measure return on investment against other media types, like print or TV,\u201d said Nick Gill, the study\u2019s primary author. However, with the average American spending 40 minutes a day on Facebook alone, ignoring social media is also perilous because \u201cit de facto becomes part of the buying decision,\u201d Mr. Gill said.Using the Houston area as a test market, Spredfast and Hyundai began offering dealers a digital dashboard that lets them post and manage content on all of the major social networks.Six months in, the effort has not exactly transformed the dealers into masters of the medium.They complain that they have received little guidance on how to use the tools effectively and no training on social advertising. The $275 monthly fee, which Hyundai said was less than what many dealers already spend on social marketing, has put off some. Complicating the rollout, the automaker did not hire anyone to focus on the project until last week.\u201cThe general public feels that by liking the Facebook page of a business, they\u2019re going to be inundated by selling,\u201d Mr. Todd said.Mr. Todd also tends the dealership\u2019s presence on Google Plus, which he believes helps improve its ranking in Google searches. He does not bother much with Twitter, where his posts elicit no response. (Twitter declined to comment on how auto dealers use its service.)So far, Mr. Todd has not been able to trace any deals directly to his social efforts, but overall sales are up almost 50 percent over the past year, which he attributed partly to new digital marketing efforts.\u201cI don\u2019t even bother wasting my people\u2019s time posting all day,\u201d he said. By focusing on ads, including ones that target car buyers when they are near rival dealers, he said, he increased sales and cut marketing expenses per car sold to $90 from $500.Carolyn Pawelek, the Spredfast vice president overseeing the Hyundai project, said dealers needed to learn how to create engaging posts before wasting money promoting them. \u201cMost dealers in our system are not ready to place ads,\u201d she said.She oversees digital efforts at DeMontrond\u2019s 14 auto franchises, including Hyundai, and three recreational vehicle businesses. With so many locations, she puts her energy into Google search marketing and Facebook.Ms. Ross discovered the power of Facebook advertising when a recent post about DeMontrond R.V.\u2019s repair services got no \u201clikes.\u201d After she promoted it as an ad, she said, \u201cmy manager called me on Monday to tell me he\u2019d received 10 new orders for roof repair.\u201dOther industries that rely on individual sales representatives, like financial services, are also struggling to figure out how to help their agents use social media.\u201cIf you look out five years, this will be table stakes,\u201d Ms. McDonnell said.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of the general manager of a Hyundai dealership in Huntsville, Tex. He is Matt Howell, not Mark.Advertisement"}

That debate has held up Puerto Rico\u2019s plan to sell as much as $2.95 billion in bonds \u2014 a critical source of liquidity \u2014 because potential investors want to see the commonwealth\u2019s long-term fiscal plan before agreeing to lend more money.Without that long-term bond deal, and another shorter-term financing that Puerto Rico needs to complete this summer, the government\u2019s liquidity could be depleted by July, David H. Chafey Jr., the chairman of the development bank, said in an interview.\u201cFor us to be able to borrow from traditional investors or hedge fund investors, they will say show me your plan and show your budget,\u201d Mr. Chafey said.Puerto Rico, which is struggling with more than $70 billion in debt and a sluggish economy, has increasingly relied on hedge funds to buy its debt.Even if the investors were willing to lend to Puerto Rico without a long-term fiscal plan in place, Mr. Chafey said, they could demand prohibitively high rates and onerous terms.Advertisement"}

Officials in Mr. Froman\u2019s office \u2014 who dispute Ms. Wallach\u2019s version of the Citigroup episode \u2014 denounce her as an alarmist demagogue whose organization has used distortion and scare tactics to discredit free trade. Ms. Wallach and her liberal allies call Mr. Froman a toady to corporate America \u2014 and arrogant to boot.Loyalties to the two opposing forces are stark.By contrast, \u201cLori Wallach? She\u2019s got such granular knowledge,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s my source of information and knowledge.\u201dRepublicans have lauded Mr. Froman for his full-throttle effort to secure the trade accord and his constant availability to them. Likewise, Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, a Democrat more open to the trade bills, shrugged off the hostility expressed by many in his party.\u201cWhen I\u2019m asking burning questions about human rights and labor rights and the environment and communist Vietnam, I know I\u2019m dealing with a professional,\u201d he said of Mr. Froman.One unusual provision says that if members of Congress request a meeting or ask the trade representative a question, his office has to respond. The bill would also allow congressional aides with the proper security clearance to go into rooms with the Trans-Pacific Partnership texts and read them without lawmakers or officials from the trade representative\u2019s office present.\u201cThis is not personal,\u201d said Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont and another opponent of the trade effort. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly the rules that have been established in terms of transparency. It\u2019s been a disgrace, frankly.\u201dFomenting much of that umbrage is Ms. Wallach, whose tactics, detailed treatises and Capitol Hill briefings have torn apart the chapters of the Pacific accord that have leaked out. She has castigated Mr. Froman\u2019s tight control over the contents of the agreement and dismissed efforts by Republicans and Democrats to find common ground as smoke screens for a big-business agenda.Specifically, Public Citizen accused him of misrepresenting the results of past trade agreements.Ms. Wallach\u2019s role as antagonist to Mr. Froman has been decades in the making. At Harvard, the two ran in very different circles. The closest they came was a small campus building that housed both The Harvard Law Review, where the future president and his future trade negotiator were editors, and the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, where she was an officer.As for the future president, Ms. Wallach worked with him during a divisive campaign to bring more diversity to the Harvard Law faculty and again on an effort to save Harvard\u2019s program advising law students on public interest careers, said John Bonifaz, a campaign finance reformer and Wallach ally who was at Harvard at the time.Mr. Froman was part of neither effort.\u201cHe was more a corporate law type,\u201d Mr. Bonifaz said. \u201cA lot of people at law school were focused on going out and making a ton of money.\u201dIn fact, that was not Mr. Froman\u2019s initial career path. Straight out of law school, he went to Albania to help that tiny impoverished nation\u2019s legal system. He spent most of the 1990s in the Clinton administration, at the White House and at Treasury, finally following Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin to Citigroup in 2001, only to return to Washington in 2009 to join the Obama White House as an emissary to international economic organizations.Through it all, his path kept crossing Ms. Wallach\u2019s. In 1998, she bedeviled the Clinton administration with her campaign to deny the president new fast-track trade authority, a fight her side won. In 1999, as Mr. Rubin\u2019s chief of staff at Treasury, Mr. Froman clashed with her over international efforts to expand the World Trade Organization, a campaign that died after anti-globalization activists rioted in Seattle.Recalling her appearance before Citigroup executives at Mr. Froman\u2019s behest, she said that ultimately she did not take the $20,000 speaking fee, settling for her standard, much smaller amount and a commercial flight. She told the executives that trade agreements were protecting corporations at the expense of poor people, keeping pharmaceutical prices high and access to food difficult.A spokesman for the trade representative\u2019s office, Matthew McAlvanah, took issue with Ms. Wallach\u2019s account.Mr. Froman \u201cdoesn\u2019t recall Ms. Wallach from law school,\u201d he said. \u201cHe does remember that she attended a Citigroup meeting but that her demands for a private jet and an exorbitant speaker fee were rejected. She participated anyway.\u201dTheir last one-on-one meeting took place three years ago, when he was Mr. Obama\u2019s emissary to the Group of 20 and Group of 8 international economic organizations. The meeting was cordial but unproductive, she said. Late last year, Mr. Froman attended a meeting of liberal and labor groups to pitch fast-track status and the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, running into Ms. Wallach again.\u201cHe had his head handed to him,\u201d she recalled. The Trans-Pacific Partnership would be the most significant trade deal since the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1993, linking nations representing 40 percent of the world\u2019s economic output.Many of those negotiating partners \u2014 especially Japan \u2014 have said they cannot agree to enter the partnership unless Congress grants the president trade promotion authority, which would allow Congress an up-or-down vote on the final accord without the right to amend it. Without such authority for the president, negotiators would be afraid to sign off on an agreement, only to see it muddied by Congress.\u201cIf they like the trade agreement, they like Mr. Froman,\u201d said Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois, the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Democrat and a skeptic on free-trade agreements. \u201cThe critics say he is too secretive, and I think the administration is trying to change that now.\u201dMs. Wallach said she offered advice to her old adversary a year ago that he should have taken: Publish the text of the trade agreement. If the accord was so great, then everyone should be able see it, she says she told him. Otherwise, people would believe what they wanted to believe. He declined, much to her advantage.\u201cIf I was the White House, I wouldn\u2019t want him on the Hill anymore,\u201d she said, with some good cheer. \u201cFor obvious reasons, I\u2019m for having him there every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble on German Priorities and Eurozone Myths", "Date": "2015-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBERLIN \u2014 The annual spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank begin on Friday in Washington. I\u2019m looking forward to them, even if the discussion in recent years has seemed, to some commentators, a bit too well-rehearsed to provoke much discussion or thought outside of the usual comfort zones.The fact that the immediate sting of the global financial crisis has faded in much of the world has probably contributed to this complacency. Unfortunately, however, the world economy is not yet out of the woods. It still faces very concrete challenges. We are as badly as ever in need of a common understanding of what needs to be done.The financial crisis broke out seven years ago and led many countries into an economic and debt crisis. A pervasive set of myths \u2014 that the European response to the crisis has been ineffective at best, or even counterproductive \u2014 is simply not accurate. There is strong evidence that Europe is indeed on the right track in addressing the impact, and, most importantly, the causes of the crisis. Let me run through some of these myths.First, it has often been said that German insistence on fiscal austerity meant that Germany, the largest economy in the European Union, has \u201cpunched below its weight\u201d \u2014 and thereby pushed the eurozone more deeply into crisis \u2014 by not stimulating more demand. This misses the point. As in medicine, to prescribe the right treatment it is essential to have the correct diagnosis.My diagnosis of the crisis in Europe is that it was first and foremost a crisis of confidence, rooted in structural shortcomings. Investors started to realize that the member countries of the eurozone were not as economically competitive or financially reliable as the uniform bond yields of the pre-crisis years had suggested. These investors began to treat the bonds of certain countries with much more caution, causing interest rates for those bonds to rise. The cure is targeted reforms to rebuild trust \u2014 in member states\u2019 finances, in their economies and in the architecture of the European Union. Simply spending more public money would not have done the trick \u2014 nor can it now.To this end, Germany has consistently advocated an approach of structural reforms and reducing public debt without throttling growth. This is not blind \u201causterity.\u201d It is about setting a reliable framework for private-sector activity, preparing aging societies for the future and improving the quality of public budgets.In Germany, this approach has shown tangible success: The economic recovery since 2009 has been broad-based, with domestic demand as the main driver of growth. Investment \u2014 both public and private \u2014 is increasing. We are speeding up debt reduction, in line with the I.M.F.\u2019s recent call for \u201csymmetric stabilization\u201d (reducing deficits in good times, to offset deficits in bad times).More importantly, many European countries are reaping the rewards of reform and consolidation efforts. Countries like Ireland and Spain, which put far-reaching reforms into effect when they hit financial trouble a few years ago, now boast some of the highest growth rates in Europe.A second myth is the absurd claim by some commentators that Germany \u2014 being a creditor nation\u2014 was actually profiting from the crisis. I don\u2019t see how any member country can benefit from a European crisis. It is true that the German government now enjoys historically low borrowing costs. But so do almost all other eurozone members. Unconventional monetary policies pursued by the independent European Central Bank seem to have fulfilled their part there. Low interest rates help all borrowers \u2014 but they come at ever-increasing costs to savers and pension funds. We should work hard to overcome this extraordinary situation and find our way back to a well-functioning market economy, in which interest rates serve to allocate savings to the most profitable investments.This leads to my third point: For many vocal commentators the answer to the crisis in Europe has been ever-greater liquidity and ever-lower interest rates. Now that we have both, we are finding that these policy tools are no panacea, but create problems of their own. More and more experts on both sides of the Atlantic warn of dangerous bubbles in asset prices and risks to financial stability from ever-increasing leverage (financing by borrowing). And it is clear that the debt burden in many countries cannot be solved by incentives to take on even more debt.On the fiscal side, we need to prepare government budgets for an eventual normalization of monetary policy and capital markets. The ongoing debate over \u201ctapering\u201d in the United States \u2014 the end of the extraordinary period of \u201cquantitative easing\u201d by the Federal Reserve to stimulate economic growth by purchasing huge quantities of bonds \u2014 shows how difficult it is to withdraw a stimulus once governments and markets get used to it.The European Central Bank has warned many times that monetary policy cannot substitute for fiscal and structural reforms in member countries. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., has also called for further structural reforms. Such reforms include, for example, more flexible labor markets; lowering barriers to competition in services; more robust tax collection; and similar measures. I fully share this view. Monetary policy can only buy time. Our job is to make sure that this time is well used to put finances in order and economies on sustainable growth paths.The priorities for Germany, as the current president of the Group of 7 nations, are modernization and regulatory improvements. Stimulus \u2014 both in fiscal and monetary policy \u2014 is not part of the plan. When my fellow finance ministers and the central bank governors of the G-7 countries gather in Dresden at the end of next month we will have an opportunity to discuss these questions in depth, joined \u2014 for the first time in the G-7\u2019s history \u2014 by some of the world\u2019s leading economists. I am confident that we can reach some common ground in Washington in advance of that meeting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Nuclear Agreement, Analysts Weigh Deal\u2019s Effects on Iranian Politics", "Date": "2015-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCould a deal, and an easing of sanctions, empower reformers who would like to see an end to the 35-year cold war with America? Or might it set up for blame those who supported the talks, including President Hassan Rouhani, if an agreement produces less in the way of sanctions relief or economic progress than they have promised?Both situations are plausible, according to a range of experts who agree only on the pivotal nature of the talks.\u201cAfter three decades of propagating a culture of defiance against the U.S., it will be curious to see whether and how Khamenei spins a nuclear compromise as an act of resistance, not compromise,\u201d said Karim Sadjadpour, who studies Iran at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran.President Obama faces his own chorus of critics on the concessions necessary for a deal. But he is deeply invested in the talks and their potential to change relations with Iran beyond the goal of disrupting its progress toward a nuclear weapon.After the announcement of a framework for a deal on Thursday, a senior Obama administration official noted the volatility of Iranian debate around the nuclear issue. \u201cWe all tend to think of Iran as a sort of one-person country, that whatever the supreme leader says goes,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe how the framework came about. \u201cActually, Iran has politics.\u201d\u201cThere is no doubt that Javad Zarif will have to sell this deal, just like we will, and his task is not simple or a given,\u201d the official said, referring to Iran\u2019s foreign minister.Independent scholars say Iran and the United States have been at odds for so long that Tehran\u2019s factions have never had to react to a serious reconciliation.\u201cIran\u2019s civil society, in contrast to its hard-liners, overwhelmingly wants this deal to happen,\u201d Mr. Sadjadpour said. \u201cBut there are no guarantees that a nuclear deal will bring about greater political openness within Iran.\u201d He said an internal crackdown after a deal is reached was just as likely if hard-liners want \u201cto signal to people that external flexibility doesn\u2019t signal internal weakness.\u201dAs Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start.Mr. Sadjadpour said that Ayatollah Khamenei would be quick to blame Mr. Rouhani if a deal did not produce sufficient sanctions relief to be felt by most people. The supreme leader, he said, has \u201cundermined and ultimately emasculated every president he\u2019s worked with\u201d to protect himself and the regime. \u201cAfter 26 years in power, it\u2019s doubtful that he will take a different approach toward Rouhani,\u201d he said.Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council and an outspoken advocate for improved relations with Tehran, struck a more optimistic note, suggesting that an agreement could be a watershed in internal Iranian affairs.\u201cI think in many ways this is going to be decisive as to who defines Iran for the coming decades,\u201d he said after flying back to Washington on Wednesday from Lausanne, Switzerland, where he was monitoring the talks. \u201cIf there\u2019s a good deal, and sanctions are lifted and it boosts the Iranian economy, it will show that the moderates can actually get something done.\u201dMr. Parsi said that Mr. Rouhani, who took office in August 2013, had been given an extended honeymoon by most Iranians, despite economic stress and other problems, because they prefer his style to that of his more bombastic and divisive predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. \u201cThey lived through eight years of the alternative, and they know they don\u2019t like that,\u201d he said.Gary G. Sick, a former National Security Council official and now a Columbia University scholar who has studied Iran for more than four decades, said that Iran\u2019s leaders would place great weight on presenting a deal as a victory, even if they made major concessions in the fine print.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.\u201cThey need something to hold up to the populace and say, \u2018We\u2019ve stood by our rights and our dignity,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.That is in part because Iranian hard-liners, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, will be looking for ways to attack and undercut any deal, Mr. Sick said. The Revolutionary Guards \u201cthrive on hostile relations with the U.S. and benefit hugely from sanctions, which allow them to control smuggling,\u201d he said.Mr. Sick said he believed that a deal could begin a process of epochal change inside Iran.\u201cIf the sanctions are lifted, foreign companies come back in, the natural entrepreneurialism of Iranians is unleashed,\u201d he said, then Iran\u2019s political system will inevitably change, if slowly.\u201cIf you want regime change in Iran, meaning changing the way the regime operates, this kind of agreement is the best way to achieve that goal,\u201d he said.Since the Islamic government took power, one side or the other has made a move to improve relations on at least seven occasions, said David B. Crist, a Defense Department historian and author of \u201cThe Twilight War,\u201d a 2012 book on American-Iranian relations. Every attempt ended in failure, he said.Against that history, a nuclear deal would be \u201cuncharted territory,\u201d Mr. Crist said. At least initially, he said, a deal would enhance the power of Mr. Rouhani and the Iranian pragmatists, and it would probably lead to permanent diplomatic engagement with the United States.\u201cThe flip side of that is the danger of too much engagement, from an Iranian point of view,\u201d he said, adding that the influence of the West could be seen as undermining Iranian youth. \u201cAnd that could prompt a crackdown domestically.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

Figures released last week showed the growth rate had decelerated to 7 percent in the first quarter, its slowest pace in six years.\u201cThe move was widely expected, given last week\u2019s weak data releases,\u201d Qu Hongbin, an economist at HSBC in Hong Kong, wrote Sunday in a research note. \u201cHowever, the magnitude of the cut \u2014 the largest since November 2008 \u2014 signals Beijing\u2019s heightened concerns over the growth slowdown,\u201d he said. Mr. Qu calculates the move could free 1.2 trillion renminbi, or around $200 billion, for new lending.Still, the cut does not automatically translate into new lending. China\u2019s banks have grown wary of issuing loans to smaller or riskier borrowers, given the country\u2019s slowing growth. And the banks\u2019 profitability has come under pressure as Beijing has pursued financial overhauls, including steps toward full liberalization of interest rates.Most analysts expect that China will, in the coming months, make further reductions to reserve requirements for banks and to benchmark interest rates. But doubts remain over whether these steps will be enough to achieve the official target of about 7 percent growth for the full year.Despite easing moves so far, China\u2019s slowing growth has meant that Beijing has been confronted by \u201crising skepticism about the ability of the government to generate an economic recovery as it typically did in the past,\u201d Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note on Sunday.The new rate reduction, and lower overall borrowing costs in recent weeks, \u201cmarks a new stage in policy making with a more aggressive stance,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe believe other loosening measures are likely to become more aggressive as well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Is Expected to Bring Antitrust Charges Against Gazprom", "Date": "2015-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHeavily reliant on Russia for their energy needs but deeply suspicious of Moscow, some Eastern European countries have argued that the state-controlled Gazprom has inflated prices and has quashed competition. Along with imposing fines, regulators could force the company to make its business more transparent or to give individual countries more leeway to sell the gas to other places, like Ukraine.But any concerted push to alter Gazprom\u2019s business model will be seen by Moscow as a new front in what it views as the West\u2019s \u201ceconomic war\u201d against Russia, following the imposition last year of sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. The Kremlin earns significant sums from the company.\u201cThis will further worsen relations between Russia and the West,\u201d said Michael Levi, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cBut one has to assume that European policy makers knew that and decided that it would ultimately give them more leverage in dealing with Moscow.\u201dThe move by antitrust regulators was confirmed by two people with knowledge of the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because such decisions are confidential. Gazprom said it \u201ccannot comment before any documents are received.\u201d A spokesman for the regulator declined to comment.Europe is Gazprom\u2019s most important and lucrative market, accounting for half of the company\u2019s revenues. Russia has been trying to shift its focus to Asia, striking a major 30-year gas deal with China last year. But that deal is years from producing real revenues, and the price China will pay is believed to be far below the European rate.Any changes to Gazprom\u2019s practices would also challenge a key pillar of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s economic and geopolitical strategy by limiting Russia\u2019s ability to set prices that favor some customers and penalize others. This, in turn, would hamper Moscow\u2019s efforts to use the promise of cheap gas to divide Europe and break its already shaky unity on Ukraine.\u201cThis is a huge step for European energy security,\u201d said David Goldwyn, a senior energy official in the State Department during the first Obama administration. \u201cThe days of Russia controlling the ultimate destination of its gas is coming to an end.\u201dA case against Gazprom would represent the second major move of late by Europe\u2019s powerful antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager. Last Wednesday, she filed formal charges accusing Google of abusing its dominance in the market for online search in Europe.Ms. Vestager warned in a speech last week that she was prepared to conduct \u201ccompetition enforcement\u201d in European energy markets. Although she did not name Gazprom specifically, she said there was a need to act \u201cdecisively against energy companies that harm rivals, block energy flows from one E.U. country to another, or threaten to close the tap.\u201dThe European antitrust investigation began with surprise raids in 2011 on Gazprom offices and those of several of its customers, as investigators sought information on pricing and contracts. A year later, in September 2012, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, Ms. Vestager\u2019s predecessor, opened a formal antitrust case.Gazprom\u2019s willingness to wield its power was on display during midwinter \u201cgas wars\u201d in 2006 and 2009. When the company stopped providing fuel to Ukraine, it created shortages in Europe.While Brussels and Gazprom have been in negotiations over the case, they failed to produce a settlement. And the European Commission had been wary of bringing formal charges.One European concern was that an antitrust action could prompt Moscow to harden its line on Ukraine, as the West sought to resolve the fighting between Russian-backed separatists and the government in Kiev. The sanctions against Russia have only made penalizing Gazprom an even more diplomatically fragile issue.Although there are no Western sanctions on Gazprom\u2019s natural gas exports to Europe, both the European Union and the United States have limited some financing to Russian finance entities like Gazprombank. They have also limited the export of some energy exploration technologies to Russia. The formal charges against Gazprom could result in a fine. Theoretically, it could run higher than 10 billion euros, or $10.7 billion, although European Union antitrust penalties have never gone that high.The larger worry for Gazprom would be the prospect of being forced to allow more competition in markets it has long controlled. The company, for example, could eventually have to drop conditions in its contracts that restrict those utilities\u2019 power to share the gas with other countries. That would give individual countries more control over whether they consume all the gas themselves or sell some of it on to other countries, including Ukraine, something Gazprom has opposed.The charges would just be a first step. Gazprom would then have the chance to lay out its defense, and it could even still settle the case.The company has proffered commercial arguments for securing long-term contracts with national utility companies and controlling pipelines to deliver the gas. Gazprom has argued that such deals are necessary to obtain bank loans to finance its long-term and sizable capital outlays for developing gas fields in Siberia and shipping fuel to Europe.Any effort to unravel this model, the company has warned, will inevitably result in diminished investments in the gas-rich regions of Russia, and ultimately to a smaller supply of energy to Europe. \u201cThe unified export channel is a backbone of Gazprom\u2019s export strategy,\u201d a company has said on its website of its business. Still, Russia\u2019s leverage in European gas markets has been dwindling for years, whittled away by lower global gas prices from new shale fields in the United States and big liquefied-gas export projects in Qatar. The European Union has also been trying to encourage diversification of energy supplies, in part to ensure that giant gas producers like Gazprom do not control transport and sales.Consider the development of the South Stream pipeline.In recent years, Gazprom\u2019s plan to build the pipeline from Russia \u2014 under the Black Sea to Western Europe, bypassing Ukraine \u2014 became a focus of dispute. Gazprom insisted that the pipeline would enhance Europe\u2019s energy security. The European Commission, seeing it as an effort to further tighten Russia\u2019s market hold, would not give its blessing to the project without major concessions from Moscow.Bulgaria was to be the point of entry to Europe from the South Stream pipeline. But the European Commission and the United States heavily pressured Bulgaria to back away from the plan.With little chance of a resolution in sight, Mr. Putin said in December that he would bring gas through Turkey instead. While negotiations between Ankara and Moscow are proceeding behind closed doors, it is still unclear how a Turkish pipeline would overcome European objections.Andrew Higgins contributed reporting from Riga, Latvia, Clifford Krauss from Houston, Stanley Reed from London and Andrew E.

{"Headline": "Despite Federal Regulation, C.E.O.-Worker Pay Gap Data Remains Hidden", "Date": "2015-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameInvestors who take the time to wade through corporate reports on what their top executives are paid are all too familiar with the problem of information overload.But no matter how hard they look, there is one figure investors won\u2019t find in the jumble of tables, charts and dollar signs in a proxy filing. And that is a comparison of what the company paid its chief executive with what its typical employee earned.This piece of the compensation puzzle is known as the C.E.O. pay ratio, and it was supposed to have been included in public company disclosures by now. In 2010, Congress approved the Dodd-Frank law requiring such information to be an element in each year\u2019s pay disclosures. The idea was to expose how wide the gap was between a company\u2019s chief executive and its rank-and-file workers.\u201cThe pay ratio was designed to embarrass, but I think it\u2019s actually a pretty good thing,\u201d said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cThe C.E.O.\u2019s pay has to have a relationship to the pay scheme of everyone else, and I think it will force companies to rethink how they design their compensation packages.\u201dFirst, Equilar, the compensation analytics firm in Redwood City, Calif., provided figures on executive compensation in 2014 at a number of the nation\u2019s largest companies. Filings from 64 companies that had submitted their proxies by March 30, 2015, were included in this exercise. Compensation consisted of base salary, cash bonuses, perquisites and the grant-date value of stock and option grants.Using the March 30 figures, Mr. Baker, an expert in labor economics, worked with Nicholas Buffie, a research assistant, focusing on the 12 highest-paid executives in the group. They estimated the median wage for all the other employees of each company and compared that with the corresponding C.E.O.\u2019s total 2014 compensation. These are imprecise and rough estimates. Given the absence of detail companies provide about their work force \u2014 such as how many employees work in the United States versus abroad \u2014 it is impossible for any outsider to nail down a precise number.\u201cClearly the big winners in the economy over the last three to four decades have been those at the top,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cThis is one way to illustrate that.\u201dA Disney spokesman said that 92 percent of Mr. Iger\u2019s compensation was based on the company\u2019s financial performance, which was outstanding in 2014.A Microsoft spokesman disputed the calculation, saying that a typical employee at the company earned \u201cwell north of $100,000,\u201d and that much of Mr. Nadella\u2019s pay would be realized only in coming years \u2014 if the company performed well. He contended that a better measure of Mr. Nadella\u2019s pay for 2014 was $22.75 million.Using Microsoft\u2019s figures, Mr. Nadella\u2019s pay ratio would still be at least 150 to one.A company spokeswoman said its executive compensation was linked to company performance, \u201cand our board has determined that Howard Schultz\u2019s pay reflects both competitive considerations and value to the company.\u201dShe added that lower-level workers receive a wide array of benefits in addition to their salaries.A Honeywell spokesman said \u201cmore than 90 percent of our C.E.O.\u2019s pay is variable, at-risk and long term,\u201d emphasizing profit growth and stock appreciation.An AT&T spokesman said 92 percent of the C.E.O.\u2019s target compensation was tied to company performance, including stock price. Officials at the other companies declined to comment or didn\u2019t return calls.Again, these are rough estimates. But without an S.E.C. rule, the public companies that reveal their chief executives\u2019 pay over the next few months will not have to account for the pay ratio comparison with their workers. That\u2019s too bad.\u201cThese C.E.O.s are smart, hard-working people,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cBut there is no basis for believing that if companies don\u2019t pay $84 million they won\u2019t attract top talent. You go back 40 years and they had smart, hard-working people too. They were well-paid, but not like they are today.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once-Prized Tibetan Mastiffs Are Discarded as Fad Ends in China", "Date": "2015-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Tibetan mastiffs are so 2013.Instead, earlier this year Nibble and 20 more unlucky mastiffs found themselves stuffed into metal chicken crates and packed onto a truck with 150 other dogs. If not for a band of Beijing animal rights activists who literally threw themselves in front of the truck, Nibble and the rest would have ended up at a slaughterhouse in northeast China where, at roughly $5 a head, they would have been rendered into hot pot ingredients, imitation leather and the lining for winter gloves.These days, those mastiff breeders left in the business are suffering from overcapacity, as it were. Buyers have largely disappeared, and prices have fallen to a small fraction of their peak. The average asking price for desirable dogs \u2014 those with lionlike manes and thick limbs \u2014 is hovering around $2,000, though many desperate breeders are willing to go far lower.\u201cIf I had other opportunities, I\u2019d quit this business,\u201d said Gombo, a veteran breeder in China\u2019s northwestern province of Qinghai, who like many Tibetans uses just one name. He said keeping one of his 160-pound carnivores properly fed cost $50 to $60 a day.\u201cThe pressure we\u2019re under is huge,\u201d he said.Since 2013, about half the 95 breeders in Tibet have gone under, according to the Tibetan Mastiff Association, and the once-flourishing Pure Breed Mastiff Fair in Chengdu, in the southwestern province of Sichuan, has been turned into a pet and aquarium expo.Nomadic families have long used mastiffs as nocturnal sentries against livestock thieves and marauding wolves. A primitive breed with a deep guttural bark, they are inured to harsh winters and the thin oxygen of the high-altitude grasslands; like wolves, females give birth only once a year. \u201cThey have the power to fearlessly protect possessions, human beings and livestock from any kind of threat, and people are proud of them,\u201d said Gombo, as a trio of dogs in his yard, tethered to stakes, lunged madly at a group of strangers.Li Qun, a professor at Nanjing Agricultural University and an expert on Tibetan mastiffs, said speculators were partly to blame for sabotaging what had been a healthy market. But also, as prices spiraled upward, unscrupulous breeders began mating pure Tibetan mastiffs with other dogs, diluting the perceived value of the breed and turning off would-be customers. \u201cBy 2013, the market was saturated with crossbreeds,\u201d Professor Li said.In recent years, a number of Chinese cities have banned the breed, further denting demand and perhaps contributing to the surge in abandonments.\u201cIt makes you feel so hopeless because not even the police will help, even though what these people are doing is illegal,\u201d said Anna Li, who runs a hedge fund when she is not organizing guerrilla operations to stop dog-packed trucks on Chinese highways.During her 25 years in China, Ms. Peng has seen successive waves of dog fads, which invariably begin with speculative breeding and end in mass abandonment. \u201cTen years ago, it was German shepherds, then golden retrievers, then Dalmatians and then huskies,\u201d she said. \u201cBut given the crazy prices we were seeing a few years ago, I never thought I\u2019d see a Tibetan mastiff on the back of a meat truck.\u201dPatrick Zuo and Adam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Shortage of Funds for Food Safety", "Date": "2015-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe Obama administration took two years to propose rules to carry out the law, partly because the complexity of the food system required a methodical approach and perhaps also from fear of being labeled job-killing regulators during an economic downturn. Consumer groups successfully sued to accelerate the timetable for final rules, and the Food and Drug Administration agreed to publish important regulations later this year. There is no doubt of the need for food-safety reforms. Thousands of people have been sickened in past years by tainted peanut butter, spinach, eggs and melons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that each year roughly one in six Americans (or 48 million people) get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die of food-borne illnesses.The Food Safety Modernization Act was designed to prevent deadly outbreaks, not just react to them. It put the burden on food producers to make sure that their products are safe and to develop plans to prevent contamination. It also gave the F.D.A. new powers to set standards for harvesting fresh produce, recall tainted foods and monitor produce imported from abroad. The Congressional Budget Office had estimated that the F.D.A. would need a total of $580 million from 2011-15 to carry out its reforms. That is a pittance for policing an enormous sector of the nation\u2019s economy and barely noticeable in the vast federal budget. Yet Congress has appropriated less than half that amount \u2014 roughly $162 million \u2014 over the five-year period.The president\u2019s budget request for fiscal year 2016, which starts in October, asks for an appropriation of $109.5 million, an increase from $27.5 million in the current year. In addition, it calls for an increase of almost $192 million in user fees from the industry that it is virtually certain not to get. The F.D.A. in its last five budget requests proposed user fees that would cover the bulk of the costs, but Congress rejected those proposals after industry lobbying.Even the F.D.A.\u2019s modest request for $109.5 million will face opposition in both chambers of Congress. Last month, for example, Representative Hal Rogers, a Kentucky Republican who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, expressed concern about the size of the agency\u2019s overall budget request and said it \u201cwill be tough to swallow\u201d more than $100 million for the food safety law. That is astonishingly shortsighted. The lack of money will make it difficult for the agency to retrain inspectors, assist the states, provide guidance to small farmers and manufacturers and verify the safety of food imports.As Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat who helped write the law, said, \u201cIf we keep shortchanging the F.D.A., it will continue to cost us billions of dollars a year to deal with food-borne illness.\u201d Regardless of whether the food safety programs are financed by user fees or government appropriations, Congress needs to find the resources to protect the public from germ-tainted foods.

{"Headline": "ZPM Espresso and the Rage of the Jilted Crowdfunder", "Date": "2015-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Money Issue\u201cThank you all very much,\u201d Update 57 concluded, by way of goodbye. \u201cWorking on this project was the most ambitious and meaningful undertaking any of us have ever attempted. Getting to know all of you, and working to create some seriously cool technology, was one of the most rewarding things we\u2019ve ever done. We are deeply and truly sorry that despite our best efforts, we were not able to get this machine across the finish line. Love, Gleb, Igor and Janet, Team ZPM.\u201dIt had been three long years of gradual disappointment since the 1,500 or so supporters of ZPM Espresso \u2014 otherwise known as the PID-Controlled Espresso Machine project on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter \u2014 each put a few hundred dollars, or some $370,000 in total, into the campaign, and eight months since the last communiqu\u00e9 from the project\u2019s creators. Now, with Update 57 in January, ZPM Espresso announced that it was winding itself down. For the backers who expected a ZPM machine for their pledge, there would be neither fulfillment nor refunds. All accumulated moneys, the update said, were dispersed on the nonrecoverable engineering costs involved in ZPM\u2019s failed attempt to manufacture an inexpensive commercial-grade espresso machine for the home market.Ian Woodhouse, the 44-year-old director of operations for a Toronto real estate developer, was one of ZPM\u2019s earliest and most ardent backers. Three years on, though, no new blow could surprise him. The update represented exactly what he had long come to expect from the creators. It was evasive and opaque. There was no clear explanation for the company\u2019s insolvency. Woodhouse was especially nettled by that valediction: \u201clove.\u201d What he wanted, he told me later, was not another update \u201csigned \u2018love.\u2019 They always signed their updates \u2018love.\u2019\u2009\u201d He could see that it seemed like a peculiar fixation, but the word was so disingenuous and cloying, and it made him angry. \u201cNotice,\u201d he instructed me, \u201chow I keep bringing up the \u2018love\u2019 thing.\u201d It reminded him that what ought to have been a straightforward financial transaction had somehow left him feeling taken advantage of and betrayed.Powerless to act individually, the backers began, in Update 57\u2019s wake, to organize. Their first step was a Facebook group, \u201cRipped off by ZPM Espresso,\u201d but Woodhouse feared it wasn\u2019t private: The principals of ZPM, who seemed to him at once inept and robust in their malfeasance, might easily monitor the activity there. So Woodhouse, along with a few others among the more persistent backers, instead set up a private forum on the messaging service Slack, where they shared their sense of affliction and pondered legal or moral redress. The legal options were limited. Although Kickstarter\u2019s terms of use stipulate that any creators unable to satisfy the terms of their agreement with their backers might be subject to legal action, no sane attorney would initiate a class-action suit on a contingency-fee basis against insolvent creators, and no sane backer would ante up the necessary legal fees.The other alternative was a consumer-protection suit filed by a state attorney general, but for that to proceed, the backers would need evidence of actual fraud, which they spent an enormous amount of time and energy trying to uncover. As Woodhouse, who speaks in the tone of a reasonable man drawn hopelessly against his will into a vast conspiracy, put it to me, \u201cWe found out a whole bunch of interesting information.\u201d He ticked off the names of four lawyers, an unpaid accountant and two Silicon Valley investors. He delved into what he dug up in the corporate-filings section of the State of Georgia\u2019s website, and on a shady-seeming portal seeking to bundle Chinese angel investments. By his estimations, ZPM had ultimately raised $1.2 million, all of it gone and unaccounted for. The ZPM founders, the backers discovered in their attempt to serve up (at the very least) a small-claims action, were lying low; they had left Atlanta and absconded for San Francisco.Everything Woodhouse could find out, however, was \u201cessentially hearsay,\u201d he said. He was exasperated. As someone involved in the project from its beginning, he felt entitled to know everything. Why did the creators never reveal that the project\u2019s founding engineer left the company for another job? Why were the other founders scrubbing their social-media profiles of connections to ZPM? Woodhouse had been caching screen shots, updates and videos to make sure the remaining data weren\u2019t similarly disappeared.As the backers exchanged theories in private, matters were quick to escalate. Woodhouse registered the web addresses glebpolyakov.com and janettambasco.com \u2014 the names of the two lead ZPM founders. He did it, he explained, \u201cbecause I wanted to have something of value to them.\u201d By then, it seemed to him that the only possible path to accountability was public shame. In response, on Kickstarter, Polyakov posted that he wished Woodhouse hadn\u2019t done something so needlessly personal. To Woodhouse, this was yet another sign that the creators had all the leverage. Woodhouse was anonymous on Kickstarter, and Polyakov could have linked him to the domain names, he surmised, only if the private group was compromised \u2014 indeed, infiltrated.The rancor is due, perhaps, to a fundamental confusion about what crowdfunding really is. On one hand, a backer is not a customer, because the product does not exist yet and may never; Kickstarter is constantly reminding its patrons that the platform is not a store. (On some level, backers must already know this, or else they wouldn\u2019t be backers; if Ian Woodhouse had just wanted an inexpensive espresso machine, the top seller on Amazon retails for $86 and has thousands of five-star reviews.)On the other hand, though, neither is a backer an investor, even if many of ZPM\u2019s backers insisted they be treated as such. A Kickstarter pledge does not buy a portion of a company. Backers do not sit on the board; they are not enfranchised to review the company\u2019s audited financials. Investors\u2019 interests, at least ideally, are aligned with those of the company, whereas nothing in the crowdfunding relationship ties a backer to the company for the long term. Moreover, the last thing Kickstarter wants to deal with is S.E.C. regulations.In the platform\u2019s early days, Kickstarter\u2019s founders hardly imagined that a situation like this would arise. Neither was a technologist \u2014 Perry Chen, now 38, was an artist and gallerist, and Yancey Strickler, 36, was a music journalist \u2014 and although several of their recent hires have engineering backgrounds, they continue to see Kickstarter as something of an arts institution. Their office building, in Brooklyn\u2019s Greenpoint neighborhood, is a remodeled pencil factory where thousands of square feet are given over to a gallery, a theater and a shadowy, silent library. During the platform\u2019s initial phase, it did support some manufactured objects (simple iPhone cases, for example), but it wasn\u2019t until 2010, when the founders were faced with an iPhone tripod proposal, that they had to decide if such commercial projects qualified as \u201ccreative\u201d in the way they intended. As Strickler remembers it, the tripod\u2019s creators responded that their particular tools happened to be injection molding and AutoCAD software, but that their enterprise was absolutely in the spirit of the platform. Kickstarter agreed to host the project, but that decision inspired a sustained effort to shape best practices for gadget campaigns. Its new rules included a requirement that there be a working prototype, and a prohibition on fancy computer renderings. (A spokesman for Kickstarter noted that if ZPM had listed its project today, it would have had to work hard to bring its pitch up to that standard.)Even arts projects, of course, sometimes fall through. In December 2009, for example, the musician Josh Dibb (a member of Animal Collective) raised $26,000 to travel to Mali and record an album; six years on, his backers have yet to enjoy a single limited-edition-LP chord. A documentary filmmaker I spoke with raised more than $100,000 in 2012 to make a film about happiness in the Himalayas; he is drained from the effort of trying to explain himself to his backers. But the problem is especially acute with devices. The Wharton School professor Ethan Mollick, who has published several papers on crowdfunding, has found that more than 80 percent of hardware projects ship with significant delays. Most of those do ultimately deliver something, but Mollick has found that 14 percent of the projects studied have, since 2012, shipped either nothing at all or something too shoddy to use. An entire new consulting industry has in turn grown up to help crowdfund products. Just last month, Kickstarter unveiled a new section of its site, Campus, where creators can share hard-won advice and concerns.The policy change has made things cleaner for Kickstarter when projects fail, but it arguably has complicated the creator-backer dynamic. If backers lack an absolute right to a product, and their legal options are limited, the policy only heightens their feeling of entitlement to full disclosure. \u201cI long ago gave up on getting a machine, but I want my $250 of information,\u201d Woodhouse told me. Backers feel they are part of an Internet community that has been not merely disillusioned but somehow also rendered unreal, and they get worked up to know how they were let down. The sense of broad collective purpose that makes any given Kickstarter campaign compelling is exactly what can make it, for backers and creators alike, especially dangerous.\u201cI wish the backers weren\u2019t so mean,\u201d Polyakov said.Tambasco nodded. \u201cI wish we\u2019d done a better job.\u201dPolyakov is tall and stocky, with a wide, round face and hooded hazel eyes that suggest, in a cultured St. Petersburg family, the lingering threat of some ancestral steppe horseman. Tambasco is half-Italian and petite, with a dusky voice, profuse dark hair, vexed eyebrows and dark, shining eyes; like Polyakov, she makes an immediate impression of great intelligence, hers feisty and quilled even in her post-traumatic delirium. Without even once interrupting or talking over each other, they spent a few hours alternating their way through the story of how they ended up broke and vilified. Tambasco wore two layers of faded-fern military fatigue jackets and high, zippered black combat boots over scruffy leggings; Polyakov, a light beige sweater and thin dress slacks. Although it was 75 degrees and sunny, Tambasco cupped her gigantic, bitter black coffee with both hands for warmth. The scene was far removed from the remote and starlit tiki lounge in the backers\u2019 imaginations, where she sipped umbrellaed drinks.Polyakov met ZPM\u2019s original engineer, Igor Zamlinsky, when they were children in Atlanta\u2019s Russian-Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 community. In Russia, their parents were artists and scientists; in Atlanta, Polyakov helped his mother run a \u201cEuropean\u201d deli, which provisioned Atlanta\u2019s expat scene with everything Continental, from weisswurst to stuffed cabbage. He was born on Sakhalin, a Siberian island where his mother was doing climatology research. He grew up in St. Petersburg and came to the States when he was 5. In high school, he and Zamlinsky split their time between the garage, where they disassembled appliances and played with chemistry sets, and the local coffee shop, where the espresso they chain-drank gave the air an aroma of lost cosmopolitan sophistication. In 2011, Zamlinsky, during his senior year of college, resurrected a crude but effective espresso machine he once jury-rigged from spare parts, and that summer, the two sat around tetchy and overcaffeinated, lobbing possible business ideas back and forth. The least contrived and lame idea they came up with was to sell their coffee, or rather their machine itself.Unlike any espresso machine then available for either the home or the commercial market, Zamlinsky\u2019s device used a cheap microcontroller ($20 off the shelf at RadioShack), along with an innovative pump design, to provide exacting digital control over pressure and temperature. Nearly everybody agrees that when it isn\u2019t on the fritz, the coffee it produces is excellent, perhaps even as good as shots pulled from the sculptural chrome La Marzoccos on every grounds-strewn marble countertop from La Colombe to Intelligentsia.Polyakov thought Kickstarter was the likeliest place to scrounge up $20,000. That would allow them to buy a milling machine and set up a backyard foundry. If they were willing to discount to zero the value of their own labor, and put materials costs on their credit cards, they could hand-assemble 50 prototype units and price them at $200 apiece without losing all that much money. For help with their initial pitch, they drafted Tambasco, a high-school friend with a degree from Princeton in molecular biology and a minor in creative writing; she studied under Joyce Carol Oates. The trio shot a bumbling sales-pitch video of great charm, which ought to have dispelled any doubts that the two principals were anything but echt engineers. On Dec. 10, 2011, Polyakov pressed publish on their campaign and went to bed.When they woke up, they discovered that they had already raised $10,000. Their campaign then got picked up by a well-respected coffee blog, and they achieved the $20,000 goal within the first day. They closed out their second day at $32,000. The tech blog Gizmodo wrote that they \u201cmight not suck,\u201d and Kickstarter featured them on its front page.With Zamlinsky in the garage tinkering with machine design, and Polyakov frantic on the phone with contractors and suppliers in seven countries, they needed somebody to deal with the front end. During the initial Kickstarter campaign alone, they received more than 4,000 emails (more than a few of them, even then, in all caps). Tambasco had never intended to make ZPM customer service a full-time job, much less a three-year source of dark and deepening hollows under her eyes, but somebody had to answer those emails and write the updates. In late January, their campaign closed with $370,000 in pledges, of which they went on to collect about $330,000. They were the sixth-most-funded Kickstarter project to date. They had 1,500 orders to fill.The same goes for gadgets, perhaps even more so: You could always record an album in your basement, after all, but it\u2019s only recently that a novice outfit might attempt industrial-scale appliance production. Projects like the Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset or the Pebble watch (both of which were Kickstarter successes that went on to become big independent businesses; the former was acquired last year by Facebook for $2 billion) course with a special energy that derives from the exchange of far-flung resources among the sympathetic and like-minded. The realized object takes on a kind of totemic significance through the aspirations and the values of the community that brought it into being. It\u2019s not some black box made elsewhere and delivered overnight. The backer feels less like a passive consumer than a proud co-conspirator.At the same time, like all 21st-century consumers, Kickstarter backers have been trained to expect a world custom-engineered for total frictionlessness. Everything is supposed to work easily, right away and well. One benefit of giving our lives over to machines and algorithms, after all, is that there\u2019s no margin for human error. As for our physical objects, we expect them to be sleek and perfect, designed with a religious devotion to the harmony of form and function. It\u2019s no accident that the most common way people refer to the industrial-design studio at Apple, with its prototypes hidden from visitors under white shrouds, is as a temple. This is a kind of perfection created under the auspices of the old model: high priests, secret tabernacles, inherited authorities, management by diktat.My brother has worked at Apple for 10 years, first in operations and now in engineering. I asked him what advice he would have given to Polyakov if he\u2019d been called in to consult on the manufacturing. He thought for a minute. \u201cI honestly haven\u2019t the faintest idea,\u201d he said. This is because, despite all the advances of the maker-revolution age (off-the-shelf, open-source, programmable microcontrollers; rapid prototyping; 3-D printing; \u201cAutoCAD for Dummies\u201d), manufacturing remains a supremely difficult process, the success of which continues to rely on marshaling a lot of resources: development money, an extensive network of trusted vendors, the dedicated personnel to sit in conference rooms in concrete campuses in Shenzhen and Dongguan and refuse to budge until the product is streaming off the assembly line in the right amounts, at the right quality and at the agreed-upon price.On the fourth day of their campaign, the ZPM team pushed the machine\u2019s estimated delivery date back three months, from March 2012 to June. Even if they were willing to spend years crouched in painstaking garage assembly, there was just no way to get the parts they needed off the shelf. It is fiendishly difficult to produce 2,000 of anything, which is the number of machines ZPM ultimately had to come up with. Two thousand units neither brings you to the point where you\u2019re realizing the major benefits of economies of scale nor gives you sufficient volume to have any leverage in negotiations over price, schedule and quality. As Polyakov put it, \u201cYou sort of have to make 2,000 of something to find out if you can make 2,000 of something.\u201dWith small runs, the cost per unit can balloon. ZPM\u2019s second manufacturer, San Diego\u2019s D&K, told the founders their engineering drawings weren\u2019t adequate and presented them with overage fees totaling $100,000. Pending payment, Polyakov says, D&K is still holding the consigned parts and assembled machines hostage. (D&K declined to comment on the matter.)Eventually, though, the advice became overwhelming. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it on their own schedule, nights and weekends, taking up a huge amount of Igor\u2019s time when he\u2019s got a ton of work to do,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople got insulted because they couldn\u2019t be involved as much as they wanted.\u201d The ongoing calls for transparency put pressure on ZPM to carry on all of its business in public, but transparency and efficacy can be incommensurable ideals. ZPM couldn\u2019t blame its vendors in updates, even for the mistakes they were consistently making, if the company wanted to keep working with them \u2014 or with anyone at all. The backers had a hard time understanding this; they continued to operate under the shared assumption that more demo\u00adcracy, more engagement and more transparency lead inexorably to more success.Which is exactly what happened. With the momentum from the project\u2019s successful Kickstarter, ZPM sold another $230,000 worth of machines as online preorders; the founders hoped the extra cash would make for a better final product. Then, when they ran low on funds again, they raised another $285,000 from angel investors \u2014 which, though the founders saw the action as part of a good-faith effort to deliver on their promises, effectively broke their original covenant with the crowdfunding community. They also hired outside consultants on retainer \u2014 paid professionals who were, in spirit, the very opposite of backers, since they had no extramonetary commitment to ZPM\u2019s success. When one of those consultants demanded, in the spring of 2014, that the project act like a \u201creal start-up\u201d and go into what people in Silicon Valley often call \u201cstealth mode,\u201d the updates came to an abrupt halt. The founders hoped that by posting their email addresses and phone numbers, and offering to field queries and complaints in person, they might assuage the backer community, but this plan, in hindsight, seemed misbegotten. It only confirmed for the backers that their one plank of accountability \u2014 the public nature of the story on offer \u2014 had been withdrawn.ZPM\u2019s silence drove the backers into a tizzy. Despite the deranged conspiracy-mongering ideas to which some of them ultimately clung, the reality of ZPM\u2019s failure was pretty banal: The founders were na\u00efve and inexperienced, well intentioned but clumsy, and they serially trusted and paid the wrong people for ineffective help. Even when this was explained to the backers, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to believe it. There were calls for Polyakov to go back to Russia, for him to rot in a Mexican prison. One backer continued to leave angry comments for more than a year after he received a refund. Other backers were gratified to find a Facebook picture that seemed to them incontrovertible proof that Polyakov and Tambasco were, or had been, carrying on a romantic relationship. It was as if the secrets withheld were taking place behind the keyhole of a parental bedroom. One backer \u201cdiscovered\u201d that Polyakov\u2019s father must be Alexander Polyakov, a physicist at Princeton, and that this connection had to have something or other to do with his and Tambasco\u2019s hidden relationship. (Alexander Polyakov has no relation to Gleb Polyakov; Gleb\u2019s father, Mark Polyakov, was a computer programmer in the Soviet Union. Gleb and his mother left Russia in 1994, when Mark was murdered in a mugging on their doorstep.)The virtual family having broken up, there was a scramble to claim the household items. Woodhouse himself, who frequently described his crusade as one of solidarity with those who shelled out money they couldn\u2019t spare on a luxury item that was only ever theoretical in the first place, emailed Polyakov right after Update 57, to say: \u201cDo you still have the development or beta machines? If so, is there any way we could work something out to get one to me?\u201d He concluded mildly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry the project came to this, but I understand the complexities.\u201d (Woodhouse claims he was just trying to get Polyakov\u2019s attention.)But in ZPM\u2019s case, the enchantment was long ago irretrievably dispelled. Once the money was finally gone, and the project\u2019s consultant had bolted with engineers in tow, the founders\u2019 only option was to hope somebody might buy what remained of the company and deliver them from their moral (and, possibly, legal) commitments. They knew it would be a tough sell: They had a technology at last viable for mass production, but they were also lugging around hundreds of thousands of dollars in liabilities. Their backers, sending comments and emails into the void, had always felt a lack of leverage, but now Polyakov and Tambasco were in something of the same position. They walked into rooms with their backs already against the wall.In early March 2015, Tambasco posted a brief new update, No. 58, to the effect that the founders were in negotiations to sell ZPM. Their suitor was John Buckman, a 45-year-old serial entrepreneur and the outgoing chairman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation; he had himself been expecting a ZPM machine for some years now and was a member of Woodhouse\u2019s private group.I joined Polyakov on a trip to Buckman\u2019s home in San Rafael, about half an hour north of the Golden Gate Bridge. Buckman lives on a narrow private road up a large hill, with floor-to-ceiling windows and nobody to see from them. He greeted us as though he\u2019d just been tugged gently back to earth from a low-grade levitation session. The walls of his aerie were cream-colored and without adornment, except for five Renaissance lutes hanging in formation on a faux-Egyptian tapestry.Buckman was drawn to ZPM because he \u201chadn\u2019t yet seen someone marrying computers and espresso powerfully.\u201d He uses a state-of-the-art VacMaster VP215 Chamber Vacuum Sealer to cache his meals; his fridge, packed with rows of baggied tuber, legume and flesh, resembles an evidence locker in an organ-theft investigation. In the garage, beside his matching Segways, he has a freezer that goes to minus 6 degrees \u2014 regular freezers don\u2019t keep his fish sufficiently gelid \u2014 and a steel sous-vide basin that heats his VacMastered bags to temperatures accurate to one-tenth of a degree. His pantry countertop has a line of 13 power outlets. Polyakov set up his machine, and, once he got the calibration right, we sampled a series of amphetaminic shots.At the end of our day, Buckman sat loosely lotus-legged under the algaelike jasmine on his deck, the setting sun at his back. The light was in Polyakov\u2019s face, and he had to squint into the jasmine. There was not a whole lot to discuss. The backers suspected that Polyakov would try to sell the intellectual property and pocket the proceeds, but in fact Polyakov\u2019s total asking price for the company was $35,000 to settle the founders\u2019 legal and professional debts, equity consideration for their angel investors and, most important, a guarantee that Buckman would honor ZPM\u2019s commitment to its backers.Buckman, understandably, did not want to accept liabilities that might put his home at risk, but he had spent a lot of time on the phone with such \u201ctrolls\u201d as Woodhouse, he said, and thought he had found a way forward: He would issue each backer a coupon for a credit toward the final machine, at the value of the backer\u2019s initial pledge. He would make a thin margin on the first 2,000 machines the company owed, but he would also have an attractive redemption story, and 2,000 evangelists for his new venture. Woodhouse, who was enlisted as an adviser, was fine with the whole idea. Buckman and Polyakov agreed broadly on terms, and ZPM would soon turn over all of the engineering files needed to reproduce the machine.In April, though, even this shot at deliverance seemed to drain away. Buckman was airing many of the same grievances that the backers had: Polyakov was disorganized and confusing and opaque in his communications. Unlike the backers, Buckman had the resources to move forward on his own, and unlike Polyakov, he had no one to hold him to account. He was going to start his own company to build a home espresso machine. His new company, he told Polyakov at one point, would be called Decent Coffee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi Jinping Heads to Pakistan, Bearing Billions in Infrastructure Aid", "Date": "2015-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, travels to Pakistan on Monday laden with tens of billions of dollars in infrastructure and energy assistance on a scale the United States has never offered in the past decade of a close relationship, a gesture likely to confirm the decline of American influence in that nation.Pakistani officials say that Mr. Xi will be signing accords for $46 billion for the construction of roads, rails and power plants to be built on a commercial basis by Chinese companies over 15 years.Just as the United States sought to stabilize Pakistan during the war in Afghanistan, so China wants to prevent the spread of militant groups in Pakistan into Xinjiang, the far western region of China with a large Muslim population.A significant amount of China\u2019s new assistance, including a port facility at Gwadar on the Arabian Sea, and rails and roads leading from the port across Baluchistan Province and into western China, will be in areas close to the tribal areas where the militant groups operate.The route from Gwadar to Kashgar, in Xinjiang \u2014 a project officially called the Economic Corridor \u2014 also serves as a shortcut for the shipment of goods from Europe to China, avoiding the Strait of Malacca farther east.\u201cThe Chinese are stepping in, in a much, much bigger way than the United States ever contemplated,\u201d said Jahangir Tareen, a Pakistani businessman, and the secretary general of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party. \u201cThe assistance is far, far more than the United States government offered under the United States Agency for International Development.\u201dIn advance of his trip, Mr. Xi wrote in a column distributed to the Pakistani news media over the weekend: \u201cWe need to form a \u20181+4\u2019 cooperation structure with the Economic Corridor at the center and the Gwadar Port, energy, infrastructure and industrial cooperation being the four key areas to drive development across Pakistan and deliver tangible benefits to its people.\u201dMost striking about the visit is the scale of Mr. Xi\u2019s aid announcement compared with the American effort from 2009 to 2012 spearheaded in Congress by John Kerry, then a senator, and pressed in Pakistan by Hillary Rodham Clinton, then secretary of state. The program designated $7.5 billion for development projects over five years.That effort was a \u201cdramatic failure\u201d because the resources were scattered too thinly, and had no practical or strategic impact, said David S. Sedney, a former senior official at the Pentagon responsible for Pakistan during that period.The Chinese appear to have learned from the American program, including the notion that the American plan was designed to deliver a strategic result \u2014 deterring terrorism \u2014 but failed to do so, Mr. Sedney said.To do better than the United States, the Chinese have come up with \u201ca much larger financial commitment \u2014 and it is focused on a specific area, it has a signature infrastructure focus and it is a decades-long commitment,\u201d he said.The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday that the projects in Pakistan would be the first initiatives of the $40 billion Silk Road Economic Belt and Maritime Silk Road plans, an ambitious network of roads, rails and ports designed to link China to Europe through Central Asia and Russia, and announced with considerable fanfare by Mr. Xi in November.China\u2019s assistant foreign minister, Liu Jianchao, declined to say how much of the Silk Road funds would go to the Pakistani projects, or how much the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank would lend. \u201cIt needs huge financing. China stands ready to provide financing,\u201d Mr. Liu said.Mr. Xi embarks on his visit to Pakistan after the Finance Ministry announced last week that 57 countries had signed to join the new development bank.Perhaps just as important as China\u2019s economic assistance is a major military deal that is unlikely to be publicized during the Chinese leader\u2019s visit, Pakistani analysts said.Pakistan has agreed to buy eight Chinese submarines to counter India\u2019s naval dominance in the Indian Ocean, a $6 billion purchase approved by a parliamentary committee in Islamabad this month. The new submarines were \u201cvery quiet, capable and lethal,\u201d and a step up from previous Chinese arms sales to Pakistan, said Lyle J. Goldstein, associate professor at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I.Yufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why You Can\u2019t Put Faith in Reports of First-Quarter Economic Slumps", "Date": "2015-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStatistical PuzzleWe have heard this story before: The recovery gathers momentum, but then as the new year gets underway, the reported pace of growth in gross domestic product stalls.It\u2019s happening now. It happened in the first quarter of last year. And it happened in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Indeed, the pattern of weak first-quarter growth has occurred so often that it has led some economists to ask whether there\u2019s a problem in how the government calculates its G.D.P. numbers.I have checked the math, and they\u2019ve each gotten their sums right. Moreover, these differences are large enough that they are unlikely to simply reflect the effects of chance. And while Mr. Liesman is right that the phenomenon is apparent over the past few decades, there\u2019s no evidence of it in the 1970s and 1980s.It isn\u2019t a surprise that the economy has seasonal ups and downs. After all, summer vacations slow some industries, while others are chilled by winter snow, and the annual parade of holidays shifts spending throughout the year. But the government\u2019s economic statistics are meant to adjust for these predictable seasonal swings, through a process known as seasonal adjustment. But it appears that these adjustments have failed to do the job.I reached out to the government statisticians at the Bureau of Economic Analysis to try to understand what lies behind the recurrent first-quarter slump. Their reaction seemed to suggest that they too were surprised by these findings, and they are digging into them. In a statement, Brent Moulton, the associate director for national economic accounts, said they were \u201ccurrently examining residual seasonality in several series, which may lead to improvements in seasonal adjustments during the regular annual revision to G.D.P. scheduled for July.\u201dI could find no indication of similar problems affecting the seasonal patterns of other economic indicators. For instance, an alternative (seasonally adjusted) measure of economic growth called gross domestic income has not recorded an unusual number of first-quarter slumps. Likewise, there is no systematic difference in the quarterly pattern of seasonally adjusted growth in nonfarm payrolls.Thus, the puzzle of the first-quarter slump seems to be confined only to G.D.P. The recurring first-quarter slumps in this measure have also puzzled Wall Street economists. Mr. Liesman reports that since 1985 they have underestimated first-quarter growth 80 percent of the time, which his analysis suggests is \u201cthe most for any quarter.\u201dPart of the problem may be that data for the first quarter are typically more variable than other quarters, and it is harder to accurately adjust highly variable numbers. Moreover, estimates of the economic growth rate in the first quarter have generally been revised downward over recent years.The government is scheduled to release its estimates of the rate of first-quarter economic growth next Wednesday, and economists are expecting the numbers to show yet another economic first-quarter slump. But don\u2019t panic. My advice is to emphasize other economic indicators instead \u2014 at least until the government boffins can figure out whether the first-quarter slump is real or a statistical artifact.Advertisement"}

Moreover, they remain factually incorrect and reflect neither the legal nor the historical reality of the island. None of the United Nations Security Council resolutions on Cyprus describe the legitimate and justified Turkish intervention of 1974, undertaken in accordance with the Treaty of Guarantee of 1960, as \u201cinvasion\u201d and its subsequent presence in the island as \u201coccupation.\u201dAs the article notes, the West is aware of the close relationship between Russia and the Greek Cypriot administration, supposedly a committed member state of the European Union. Yet it is astonishing that the Greek Cypriot side pursues such policies with impunity, enjoying the recognition and political support of the West while the Turkish Cypriot people remain isolated from the world, contrary to numerous decisions of the United Nations, the Council of the European Union and the Council of Europe.The strong ties between Greek Cypriot and Russian political leaders are a matter of concern for the United States and the European Union. They are also a matter of concern for the Turkish Cypriots who live on the island under embargoes and restrictions. We have a right to be heard, and it is the responsibility and duty of the international community to ensure we are not left out in the cold. With negotiations due to restart, it is of paramount importance that Greek and Turkish Cypriots are treated equally.

Re \u201cNuclear fears in South Asia\u201d (Editorial, April 7): You paint a picture of Pakistan as recklessly expanding its nuclear arsenal. But Pakistan was not the first to introduce nuclear weapons in South Asia. It was forced to develop a nuclear capability for self-defense due to its troubled history with India and that country\u2019s accumulation of conventional and strategic capabilities. Nevertheless, Pakistan has consistently declared that its nuclear weapons are for deterrence, not war. Pakistan has no desire to engage in a conventional or nuclear arms race in South Asia.Similarly, the editorial\u2019s warnings about so-called internal turmoil in Pakistan are off the mark. Pakistan continues to deal effectively with the menace of terrorism. On the economy, only a glance at the International Monetary Fund\u2019s latest review shows that the country is in far better shape than you assert. Time and again Pakistanis have proved their resilience and determination in difficult periods. Recycling theories about impending economic disaster or terrorists posing a serious threat to the state structure serves no purpose. The writer is the press attach\u00e9 of the Pakistan Embassy.

The writer also claims that Tunisia suffered from four years of financial mismanagement by Ennahdha. Tunisia is recovering from decades of mismanagement and corruption, as well as post-revolution instability exacerbated by global recession. It is entirely unfair to blame Tunisia\u2019s difficulties on Ennahdha and its partners during their four years in office. Ennahdha and its allies took major steps to stabilize the economy after its freefall in 2011, and the party continues to contribute today as part of a government aimed at building a successful, sustainable and inclusive economy.

{"Headline": "Richie Benaud, Commentator Whose Native Tongue Was Cricket, Dies at 84", "Date": "2015-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe path from the cricket field to the commentary box is well trod, but never with greater distinction than by Richie Benaud, known to many as the voice of cricket, who died in Sydney, Australia, on Friday. He was 84.Cricket has numerous halls of fame, but none with the singular authority of the American institutions in Canton, Ohio, for football; Cooperstown, N.Y., for baseball; and Springfield, Mass., for basketball. If it did, Mr. Benaud would have been sure of enshrinement as a player if he had done nothing else in the game, or as a broadcaster had he never played.Mr. Benaud died on Friday morning, said Katie Hale, assistant chief of staff at Channel 9, the Australian broadcaster he worked for. His family said that he died in his sleep.To anyone who became aware of the sport in the last 50 years, Mr. Benaud was probably best known as a uniquely authoritative television voice, his smooth Australian tones explaining the action with dry wit, perception and economy.That authority rested on his credibility as a player, during a career in which he became a shrewd and successful captain of Australia. He also displayed an acute, questing intelligence. But unlike many who have followed in his footsteps, he also worked at acquiring the essential skills of journalism. Fame eased the transition, but he had done a BBC training course and worked as a newspaper reporter, covering a crime beat, while still a player.Richard Benaud was born on Oct. 6, 1930, in Penrith, Australia, into a cricketing family. His father, Louis, a schoolmaster of French descent, once achieved the rare feat of taking all 20 wickets in a minor-league match. Richie\u2019s younger brother, John, followed him into the New South Wales state and Australian national teams.His talent as a hard-hitting batsman, wrist-spin bowler and fielder was evident early. He played for New South Wales at 18 and for Australia at 21. Yet for years he tantalized Australia\u2019s selectors by being too good to leave out but unable to perform consistently at the top level. The England captain Len Hutton called him a \u201cfestival cricketer,\u201d meaning he was entertaining but lacked real substance.That critique was rebutted in the late 1950s. With his wrist-spin bowling, the most difficult and elusive of cricketing arts, Mr. Benaud dominated consecutive series in India in 1956 and South Africa in 1958, followed by an Ashes series at home to England in the Australian summer of 1958-59.He was also captain in the England series, getting the job ahead of the long-established Neil Harvey.Mr. Benaud\u2019s intelligence and energy revived not only Australia\u2019s team but also cricket itself, after an era of dull, defensive play. In the Australian summer of 1960-61 he found an ideal adversary in Frank Worrell, the first black captain of the West Indies. The five-match series, which started with the first-ever tied test match and was won 2-1 by Australia, drew huge crowds with attacking play by both sides.Mr. Benaud was fresh and different in other ways. He showed emotion on the field, embracing teammates after wicket-taking plays, and was a willingly fluent communicator with the news media.That he quit at only 33 without losing a series as captain reflects an age before cricket was a full-time profession in Australia. His 248 wickets in 63 tests were then an Australian record and third on the all-country list, while scoring 2,201 runs made him the first player from any country to achieve both 2,000 runs and 200 wickets in tests.\u201cIf you speak to any broadcaster from any sport, they will point to Richie as the standard-bearer,\u201d Jonathan Agnew, the BBC cricket correspondent and former England player, said on Friday. \u201cHis incredible knack was knowing what to say and when to say it \u2014 usually as briefly as possible. Richie\u2019s basic premise was not to speak unless he could add something to the television pictures.\u201dHis unique authority was evident on two occasions. In 1977, his support was essential to the credibility of the rebel \u201cSuper Test\u201d series promoted by the Australian TV magnate Kerry Packer, a revolt that transformed pay and conditions for top players, enabling fully professional careers that could last longer than Mr. Benaud\u2019s own as a player.When Channel 4 in 1998 won the rights to televise test cricket in England, beating out the BBC, it quickly recognized the single biggest act that would establish its credibility: hiring Mr. Benaud.Mr. Benaud quit British television in 2005 when the rights were secured by Sky. He had no quarrel with private enterprise \u2014 he had backed Mr. Packer \u2014 or with Sky\u2019s owner, Rupert Murdoch. His main British print outlet was Mr. Murdoch\u2019s News of the World. But he said he feared for the game if it was confined to subscription television channels.He broadcast in Australia until a serious car crash in 2013. Even then, his bosses at Channel 9 said they were willing, if he wished, for him to work from his home.Mr. Benaud guarded his privacy. When Rob Steen, a British writer, was commissioned to write a biography, Mr. Benaud refused to cooperate and asked friends and contacts to do the same. The book was never written. Mr. Benaud did pay frequent tribute to his wife of 48 years, Daphne.In a sign of his national standing, the Australian government has offered to hold a state funeral.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bronx Koreans Cope as Their Population Shrinks", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe senior center is all of one room on the second floor of a church, because its 120 members cannot afford to rent anything bigger.Or as Abraham Lee, the president of the Bronx Korean American Senior Citizen Association, lamented the other day, \u201cNo space, no money, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d He added that maybe he would win the Lotto. Queens has Flushing, Manhattan has Koreatown, and the Bronx, too, once had its own distinct, if lesser known, Korean enclaves in neighborhoods like Bedford Park, where the senior center is, and where in years past Korean delis and stores dotted the Grand Concourse.Many of these Koreans came to the Bronx in the 1970s and 1980s, even as other residents fled what was then a crime-ridden borough that had become a national symbol of urban decay. Like the Irish, Italians, Jews, Puerto Ricans and others before them, the Koreans were attracted by spacious apartments and affordable rents. They found jobs in Korean-owned businesses and at the Hunts Point food markets.But today, the remnants of this Korean community are the flip side of the usual story of immigrant groups who arrive in New York City, thrive as transplants in a neighborhood and move on. Even as Koreans who prospered were able to migrate to the suburbs, there were others who were too old, too settled or too poor to leave behind the Bronx\u2019s troubled economy, struggling neighborhood schools and persistent crime.At the same time, the stream of Korean newcomers to the Bronx slowed, as many of them chose instead to join thriving Korean communities in Queens or northern New Jersey that have become known as gateways for new immigrants because of the concentration of Korean stores, services and support networks.The Korean population in the Bronx is the smallest of the city\u2019s five boroughs. It has steadily declined by more than half to 2,214 in 2013, from 5,166 in 1990, even as the larger Korean population in the city has increased by a third, to 94,475 from 70,542 during that same period, according to an analysis of census data by Queens College\u2019s sociology department.Over all, Koreans make up just 1 percent of the city\u2019s population of nearly 8.3 million.Queens has the largest Korean population, with 61,251 residents, many of them concentrated in neighborhoods including Bayside, Flushing and Fresh Meadows. Manhattan was second with 20,273 residents scattered in neighborhoods around the largely commercial Midtown district nicknamed Koreatown, and elsewhere. That is more than three times the 6,180 residents there in 1990, according to the analysis. Brooklyn had the third largest number of Koreans, 7,968; followed by Staten Island, 2,769.The Bronx senior center in Bedford Park, at 2943 Bainbridge Avenue, is rented from the Bedford Park Presbyterian Church. The center has been losing members; it had 200 just five years ago. Many of them speak little English and find themselves culturally and socially isolated from their predominantly Latino and black neighbors. A frequent complaint is that there is no Korean restaurant nearby.In the 200-square-foot space that is the center, members crowd in for games of paduk \u2014 often called Korean chess \u2014 on Mondays, followed by English lessons and line dancing on Tuesdays. Computer skills are taught on Wednesdays, calligraphy on Thursdays. Fridays are for singing Korean pop songs from the 1960s and \u201970s.Chong Cha Lee, 62, comes to the center every week because she said she was most comfortable speaking Korean. She settled in the Bronx in 1984 with her husband and three children from Seoul; her sister was already living in the borough. Ms. Lee (who is not related to Abraham) soon found work as a hairdresser. The family joined a Korean church, shopped at Korean stores and made Korean friends.Across the Bronx, Koreans were making themselves at home. Public libraries expanded their collections of Korean-language books, and neighborhood bodegas started stocking kimchi and tofu. In the mid-1990s, a contingent of Bronx Koreans, armed with Korean flags and banners, even marched down the Grand Concourse in an annual spring parade that was part of a celebration of the borough known as Bronxweek.\u201cAll of a sudden, there was a sizable number of Koreans in the Bronx,\u201d said Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx borough historian. \u201cYou looked in the phone book, and there were a lot of people whose family name was Kim.\u201dBut over the years, many of those Korean families moved away. Those who stayed included older Koreans who said they could not afford to leave. In recent years, they have been joined by those in government-subsidized apartments for the elderly in Bedford Park and elsewhere in the Bronx. Currently, one in five Koreans living in the Bronx is age 65 or older, according to the census analysis.Ms. Lee and her husband have watched their friends move north from the Bronx, and their children settle in Connecticut and New Jersey. But they remain in the Bronx. \u201cI feel like this is home and this is where I belong,\u201d said Ms. Lee, speaking through an interpreter at the senior center.Still, Ms. Lee added that she hesitates to tell people where she resides because they can have unfavorable impressions of the Bronx. \u201cThe first thing they say is, \u2018How could you live there?\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said.The senior center was started at the church in 1988 as a place for older Koreans to come together, several members said. Then as now, many older Koreans lacked the language skills to fully assimilate into the Bronx, and often ended up cut off from support services they either did not know about or could not get access to.On a recent afternoon at the center, five women and four men were busily saving files on laptop computers. As instructions were called out in Korean, one man pulled up an image of cherry blossoms online. Two rows behind him, a woman dragged a photo of a famous Korean actor, Cha In-Pyo, into a desktop folder.The center, which opens daily during the week, also offers job training, assistance with benefits and translation services.\u201cThey\u2019re really isolated,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re living there, but there is no Korean restaurant in the Bronx and no social services that are available to them in the Korean language. It magnifies the importance of a place like the Korean senior center.\u201dIn 2012, the foundation gave the senior center the first of three grants totaling $90,000 to support its programs. The center raises $15,000 more a year in donations from individuals, businesses and churches, and $2,400 in annual membership dues of $20 per person, said Mr. Lee, the president. The center used some of the money to rent a kitchen and dining area in a nearby building, and started a weekday lunch program. The homemade plates of barbecue beef, grilled fish, curry rice and kimchi drew as many as 30 people a day. Some came an hour early, while others stayed late so they could pack up the leftovers for dinner. One 76-year-old woman, whose husband was ill and could not walk, always stopped in for two lunches to go. \u201cPeople never forget Korean food,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cYou can remember the taste even if you haven\u2019t had it in 40 years.\u201d But last year, the lunch crowd dwindled to a half-dozen people. Some of the regulars started going instead to senior programs in Queens, which sent buses to pick up them up and offered not only Korean meals but also a larger variety of Korean activities, Mr. Lee said. He ended the lunch program. \u201cIt was wasting money,\u201d he said. Mr. Lee, 77, who moved to a government-subsidized apartment in the Bronx four years ago from Yonkers, said he hoped to build the senior center back up, and eventually rent more space so that he could restart the lunch program and add more activities, like bingo, to attract more members. He said the center had become more important than ever as a link among older Koreans, many of whom are now scattered around the borough without Korean resources close by. Most mornings, he leads a group of eight to 10 older Koreans on long walks around the New York Botanical Garden or Lehman College. \u201cOlder Korean people come to America and they don\u2019t know English and they don\u2019t know American culture,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything they don\u2019t understand, so we\u2019re going to help them. The community needs this center.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fueled by Market Rally in China, GF Securities Raises $3.6 Billion in I.P.O.", "Date": "2015-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Ordinary Chinese investors are doubling down on stocks, pushing the Shanghai market to seven-year highs \u2014 and their brokers are cashing in.The securities companies that have facilitated the stock market boom are capitalizing on their own ballooning share prices by issuing huge amounts of new stock, raising billions of dollars in the process.On Tuesday, GF Securities, one of China\u2019s biggest brokerage firms, raised $3.6 billion in an initial public offering in Hong Kong, the biggest new listing in Asia so far this year.Earlier in March, Orient Securities, Citigroup\u2019s brokerage partner in mainland China, raised $1.6 billion in a Shanghai listing. And in February, shareholders of Haitong Securities, another big Chinese brokerage firm, approved its plan to raise $3.9 billion by selling additional shares in Hong Kong.The problem with bubbles is anticipating how much they can swell before bursting. Chinese investors appear to be making a counterintuitive bet that a slowing economy is good for markets because it will prompt the leadership in Beijing to respond with measures to stimulate growth. On Monday, in an effort to bolster the slumping housing market, the central bank lowered the minimum down payment on mortgages for second homes to 40 percent, from 60 percent or 70 percent previously, causing a surge in real estate shares.\u201cThe sharp drop-off in economic activity since the start of the year, along with lower inflation, will encourage greater action from the People\u2019s Bank of China over the coming months,\u201d Chang Liu, a China economist at Capital Economics, wrote Tuesday in a research report, referring to the central bank. \u201cThis will most likely push equities even higher this year,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, with markets increasingly divorced from economic fundamentals, we expect a partial reversal of these gains in 2016.\u201dShanghai\u2019s benchmark share index was the best performer in the world last year. And since Nov. 21, when the central bank began its current cycle of easing monetary policy by cutting interest rates, Shanghai stocks have risen 50 percent. On Monday, the index rose to 3,786.6 points, a level not seen since early 2008, before the financial crisis. Shares slipped 1 percent lower on Tuesday.The surge is precarious because it is increasingly being driven by ordinary investors. According to Tom Orlik, a Bloomberg economist, the results of a recent investment survey conducted by a Chinese university showed that two-thirds of all new investors in China\u2019s stock markets had completed only the equivalent of elementary or junior high school before leaving school. That compared with a dropout rate of about a quarter among existing investors. The survey was conducted at the end of last year by the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, in Sichuan Province, and covered 4,000 households across the country.But markets have since recovered, and borrowing from brokerage firms continues to fuel the increase. Outstanding margin financing has risen to more than 1.4 trillion renminbi, or about $230 billion, up from about 1 trillion renminbi at the start of the year.That has been good news to brokerage firms, whose own shares are among the best performers in the rally. GF Securities, which is already listed in China\u2019s secondary market based in Shenzhen, was able to price its Hong Kong I.P.O. on Tuesday at 18.85 Hong Kong dollars per share, at the top of the marketed price range, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified because the information was not yet public.The company raised 27.9 billion Hong Kong dollars, or about $3.6 billion. That ranks as the second-biggest I.P.O. globally this year, after that of the Spanish airport operator Aena, which raised around $4.8 billion in a listing in Madrid in February, according to data from the financial information provider Dealogic.GF Securities shares are scheduled to begin trading on April 10.GF Capital, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bocom International, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch unit were the lead underwriters of the listing and were among the 22 banks involved in marketing the deal.An earlier version of this article misstated the nature of Haitong Securities\u2019 share sale. Shareholders approved the company\u2019s plan to sell $3.9 billion worth of additional shares; they did not raise that amount of money selling additional shares.Advertisement"}

Chief, Investigated in Spain Over Finances", "Date": "2015-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The financial affairs of the former International Monetary Fund chief Rodrigo Rato have come under increased scrutiny in Spain after law enforcement officials detained Mr. Rato as part of a tax and money-laundering investigation.Mr. Rato, 66, who was a deputy prime minister and economy minister in the center-right government of former Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar in the late 1990s and early 2000s, was once one of Spain\u2019s most powerful financial figures. He was credited with steering the country to strong growth in the late 1990s, a period known as the \u201cSpanish miracle.\u201d He went on to serve as managing director of the I.M.F. from 2004 to 2007.Late Thursday, Mr. Rato was detained by the tax authorities and the police in Madrid as part of an investigation into fraud and money laundering. Prosecutors are trying to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to open a case against Mr. Rato in a 2012 episode in which he took advantage of tax amnesty to repatriate funds held offshore.Spanish television on Friday repeatedly broadcast images of the customs authorities leading Mr. Rato to a car from his home in a wealthy Madrid neighborhood.\u201dHe was the pride and now he is the shame,\u201d the political analyst Marisa Cruz wrote in the newspaper El Mundo. Others suggested that his detainment marked the end of an era in Spain.After he was released early on Friday, Mr. Rato told the newspaper El Pa\u00eds that he had confidence in the Spanish justice system. \u201cI am at home with my family and free,\u201d he said.Mr. Rato was a leading light in Spain\u2019s center-right Popular Party, which has been buffeted in recent years by a series of corruption scandals that have undermined confidence in the political establishment and the government of the current prime minister, Mariano Rajoy. Analysts said this latest scandal could further undermine Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government as he seeks re-election this year, and embolden protest groups like the leftist party Podemos.Mr. Rato is already under investigation in a fraud case during his time as chairman of Bankia. In the past, he has denied suggestions that he and fellow Bankia directors ignored or hid loan problems that resulted in the bank\u2019s financial troubles and its eventual seizure by the government.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung Beats Analyst Predictions Despite Falling Profits", "Date": "2015-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 After a tough 2014 for Samsung Electronics, the beleaguered South Korean manufacturer said it expected earnings in the first quarter of 2015 to beat analyst forecasts, in the first sign of a possible turnaround for the company.In a news release, Samsung said its operating profit was likely to have fallen about 30 percent in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2014.Despite the drop, Samsung exceeded analyst expectations by posting an operating profit of about 5.9 trillion won, or $5.4 billion, in the quarter, down from 8.5 trillion won a year earlier. Sales totaled about 47 trillion won, down roughly 12 percent from 53.7 trillion won a year earlier. The figures are preliminary; Samsung will post final earnings later this month.Samsung\u2019s forecast signals the sixth consecutive quarter of decline in operating profit, and highlights how competitive pressure from Chinese rivals at the low end of the market and Apple\u2019s iPhone at the high end has been squeezing Samsung.Still, there are signs the world\u2019s top smartphone brand is on the mend.Underscoring the recovery are two trends: better-than-expected early sales for the company\u2019s new high-end Galaxy S6 phone, and new demand for its microchips.Analysts say the S6, which features a screen that curves over the side of the phone, provides much-needed stylistic freshness.\u201cI think the reason Samsung struggled last year is they just looked boring,\u201d said Peter Yu, an analyst with BNP Paribas. He pointed out that the Galaxy model from 2014 had little to set it off from the 2013 version.\u201cEveryone caught up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it came to Android phones everything now just looks the same. If you cover up the brand, you couldn\u2019t tell the difference between the Chinese smartphones and the Samsung smartphones.\u201dThe fact that the S6 now stands out from the crowd is helping the company improve sales at the top end, where it makes the bulk of its profits. But Mr. Yu said Samsung\u2019s new strategy with its lower- and mid-tier smartphones could also help the company this year.Where before Samsung offered a large variety of lower-end smartphones, it now offers a single series \u2014 an attempt, according to Mr. Yu, to take advantage of economies of scale and increase margins for the phones.He noted that Nokia used to make 20 percent profit margins by selling a 40-euro phone. \u201cI think Samsung is trying to emulate that.\u201dOn the semiconductor front, Samsung will be helped both by smartphone companies buying more and more memory chips to put in their phones and by the resurgence of the company\u2019s microprocessor business.In particular, Lee Seung-woo, an analyst with IBK Securities, said Samsung\u2019s supplying Apple with the A9 chip for the next iPhone would be a big boon to profits in the second half of the year.Samsung is \u201ctesting the thesis that phone quality matters,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cMy thesis is that it\u2019s the software that gives Apple its lock on the high end (plus brand), so I\u2019m skeptical.\u201dFourth-quarter market share statistics also show how much Samsung\u2019s status as the global smartphone champion has eroded.In a report on sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 31, the research group IDC noted that Apple\u2019s total unit sales in the quarter nearly tied Samsung\u2019s, despite the fact that Samsung sold 33 million more handsets in the same quarter a year earlier.\u201cWhat remains to be seen is how the vendors beyond Samsung and Apple will assert themselves,\u201d Ramon T. Llamas, an analyst with IDC, wrote in the report.\u201dWith Lenovo acquiring Motorola, and Xiaomi having greater aspirations beyond China, the competitive pressure will come more from below and less from above,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis will make the smartphone race continuously competitive as 2015 shapes up.\u201dIf Apple has nearly tied Samsung in device sales, the Chinese upstarts that have been competing with Samsung in the lower-end segment still lag far behind.In the fourth quarter Samsung\u2019s global market share was 20 percent, compared with a roughly 4 percent to 7 percent global market share for each of its major Chinese rivals Lenovo, Huawei and Xiaomi.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Latest Score in Cyprus Soccer: Blown-Up Cars 6, Referees 0", "Date": "2015-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNICOSIA, Cyprus \u2014 In retrospect, the low point was probably the sixth car bombing.Because when it happened last month \u2014 when yet another Cypriot soccer league referee found his car a burned wreck \u2014 the overriding public sentiment on this Mediterranean island seemed to fluctuate between amusement and weary acceptance.\u201cPeople were laughing,\u201d Andreas Michaelides, who coached the Cyprus national team from 1991 to 1996 and now serves in the country\u2019s legislature, said. \u201cThey should be crying, not laughing.\u201d\u201cO.K., blowing up cars \u2014 we do it often, unfortunately,\u201d Michaelides said. \u201cIt is one of our sports in Cyprus, almost. But usually it was for financial reasons. \u2018You owe me money, you don\u2019t pay\u2019 \u2014 that kind of thing. For football? You don\u2019t do these things for football.\u201dYet bombs targeting referees suspected of corruption are only a sliver of a much larger morass that has enveloped professional soccer in Cyprus. While most global fans think of European soccer as being in the glossy, high-end mold of England\u2019s Premier League or Germany\u2019s Bundesliga, the reality in many European countries, particularly in the eastern part of the continent, is far more grim.In 2013, FIFPro, the global players\u2019 union, issued a release to its members warning them against signing contracts with Cypriot teams because clubs there routinely failed to honor them. And Federbet, a European company that tracks betting patterns in soccer, revealed that its evaluations of matches in Cyprus in 2014 indicated that more than half of the games showed signs of having been manipulated.\u201cI cannot say Cyprus football is very healthy,\u201d Prodromos Petrides, the chairman of one of the island\u2019s most successful clubs, Apoel Nicosia, said in an interview at his office. \u201cI am very sad to say that every day I am talking to my friends, my colleagues in the club, my family \u2014 we are passing through a big corruption everywhere in Cyprus. The government, the financials, the ministries \u2014 everywhere that money is involved, there is risk.\u201dThe Cypriot league\u2019s problems are simultaneously simple and complex, but money is the root of many of its ills. There is little regulation when a new owner takes over a team, so when the European financial crisis buckled the economy in recent years, many clubs were overwhelmed by the fallout from risky decisions made in better times.As recently as 2014, according to research conducted by Cyprus\u2019s players\u2019 union, the collective debt of the clubs in the island\u2019s top two divisions totaled roughly 60 million euros, or about $65 million.\u201cThere was a lot of money in Cyprus football about five, six, seven years ago,\u201d said Spyros Neofitides, the president of the players\u2019 union. \u201cNow it feels like there is none.\u201dThat shortfall is evident in how teams treat players, as well as in the match-fixing allegations that linger over Cypriot soccer like a smoky fog. New financial regulations from European soccer\u2019s governing body, UEFA, have ensured that more players\u2019 salaries are being paid, according to Neofitides \u2014 three years ago, 77 percent of professional players in Cyprus said they were not paid on time \u2014 but there are still many examples of instances in which clubs use improper, if not illegal, methods to deal with money troubles.\u201cHe called me right afterward, told me what happened and told me that the gorillas even had his old contract so that they could compare the signatures,\u201d Neofitides said. \u201cNow, come on \u2014 how would they have gotten his old contract?\u201dLast year, Neofitides said, a player on another club, Limassol, claimed to have had a similar experience; he said he was confronted by two men who said they would plant drugs in his car and call the police if he did not agree to a pay cut.Playing in the Champions League infused Apoel with much-needed cash \u2014 Petrides, the team\u2019s chairman, said the club received about $14 million, or $4 million more than its total annual budget, for its most recent appearance \u2014 but the reputation of the Cypriot league, in addition to the ongoing economic crisis, has made it difficult to find income from outside sources. (The car bombings have not helped, either.)\u201cIn other countries, the big teams are getting sponsorships from insurance companies, telecommunications companies, airlines and banks,\u201d Petrides said. \u201cIn Cyprus, our banks \u2014 they\u2019re not giving anyone money. Our insurance companies are like our banks. And our national airline went out of business. What can we do?\u201dCriticisms of the league\u2019s governance run the gamut, but match-fixing is the most significant and persistent concern. With money so scarce, it seems everyone has a story in which they were, or someone they knew was, offered cash in exchange for ensuring a game\u2019s result.Not surprisingly, most players and executives are reluctant to go on the record, but the brazen nature of some stories is staggering. One player recalled a bus ride to a game last year during which the president of his team boarded the bus and informed the players that they would be losing the first half that day and then winning the second half. Several of the players texted their friends to let them know they should bet accordingly.\u201cBut when the player came down to my office and I asked him to make an official statement,\u201d Neofitides said, \u201che said no.\u201d In a survey of about 400 professionals conducted by the players\u2019 association, nearly a quarter said they expected to be approached about fixing a match from someone connected to their own club.But it is not just the players who are suspected. Part of the reason there has been less-than-expected sympathy for officials who have had their cars torched is the possibility that certain referees may be altering outcomes, too.An investigation into the executive\u2019s actions continues, but in the meantime Panayi has become a lightning rod among soccer fans. Some praise him for his courage; others question his motivations and his truthfulness.\u201cThere are about 300 referees in Cyprus,\u201d Panayi said during an interview at a cafe here. \u201cIn my opinion, about 10 percent of them are clean. Ten percent, maximum.\u201dMichaelides, the former coach, admitted that it could be difficult to be optimistic. Still, a proposed law would allow the police to wiretap telephone conversations, which could make it easier to identify match-fixers. The inability of the police to do that now is often cited in the lack of enforcement here, but so too is motivation.The men were subsequently released without being charged.George Psyllides contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Consumers, the last link in the chain, bet their very health on responsible practices along the way.The annual cost of food-borne illnesses in the United States is $14.1 billion to $16.3 billion, according to a 2013 analysis by the Agriculture Department. The federal government has called for a shift from reaction, which usually means a large recall after people have fallen ill or died, to prevention, to reduce the number of such episodes. Wary customers want their food to be safe and genuine, and food retailers, who rely on a global array of suppliers, are looking for ways to protect their brands.Food testing sits at the intersection of those desires. Mr. Samadpour, who opened IEH\u2019s first lab in 2001 with six employees, now employs over 1,500 people at 116 labs in the United States and Europe. He refers to his company, one of the largest of its kind in the country, as \u201ca privately financed public health organization.\u201dThe Promise of DNA TestsThe two low-slung wooden buildings that house IEH\u2019s labs at its base in Seattle feel more like a high school chemistry lab than the center of a national food security network; there\u2019s an acrid smell, and the counters are crammed with vials of various shapes and colors, centrifuge machines and lined notebooks full of data entries.This is where analysts coax DNA out of a tiny sample of whatever is being tested. For lethal threats, like E. coli O157 in ground beef, the detection process involves a grim recipe of ground beef and a broth infused with nutrients that E. coli likes to eat, put in a warm place to rest for 10 hours \u2014 at which point a single E. coli cell, if it exists, will have spawned one million easy-to-detect siblings. For fraud cases, the process is somewhat simpler; lab technicians run a DNA test or chemical analysis to confirm a sample\u2019s identity.Cheap technology has made this kind of testing possible. \u201cTen years ago, it would have taken millions of dollars to sequence a genome,\u201d Mr. Samadpour says. \u201cNow it takes $100. We do thousands a year.\u201dWhile the lab focuses primarily on safety issues like the cumin-and-peanut inquiry, there are enough fraud calls to support specialties among the lab technicians, like Kirthi Kutumbaka, referred to by his colleagues as \u201cthe emperor of fish\u201d for his work on a seafood identification project. Once a fish is filleted, genetic testing is the only way to confirm its identity, making it a popular category for fraud.IEH\u2019s clients are primarily vendors who supply retailers and manufacturers, and they generally prefer to remain anonymous for fear of indicating to consumers that they have a specific worry about safety.Costco is one of the retailers that use IEH\u2019s services, and the company doesn\u2019t mind talking about it.\u201cWe have to inspect what we expect,\u201d says Craig Wilson, the company\u2019s vice president for quality assurance and food safety, meaning that products have to live up to their labels, particularly items in Costco\u2019s own Kirkland Signature line.Costco has a smaller margin of error than most food retailers; the company stocks only about 3,500 so-called S.K.U.s, or stock keeping units, while most retailers offer as many as 150,000. A single misstep is a far greater percentage of the whole. That\u2019s why, in addition to retaining IEH, it operates its own 20-person testing lab.\u201cWe\u2019re not typical,\u201d Mr. Wilson says. \u201cWe have one ketchup, one mayonnaise, one can of olives, Kirkland Signature olive oils and a couple of others.\u201d Since 2003, the United States Department of Agriculture has required the testing of beef used for ground beef, resulting in a 40 percent reduction in cases of E. coli traced to beef consumption. Costco, which processes 600,000 to 700,000 pounds of ground beef daily, does extensive micro-sampling of the meat at its California facility, Mr. Wilson says.The company expects its suppliers to absorb testing costs and gets no resistance, given the size of the resulting orders. Costco sells 157,000 rotisserie chickens a day. As Mr. Wilson put it: \u201cIf vendors get a bill for a couple hundred bucks on a $1 million order, who cares? They don\u2019t.\u201dThe sheer volume also enables Costco to demand action when there is a problem. After a 2006 outbreak of E. coli tied to Earthbound Farm\u2019s ready-to-eat bagged spinach, in which three people died and more than 200 became ill, Mr. Wilson, one of Earthbound\u2019s customers, instituted what he calls a \u201cbag and hold\u201d program for all of Costco\u2019s fresh greens suppliers. He required the suppliers to test their produce and not ship it until they had the results of the tests.Earthbound responded to the outbreak with a \u201cmultihurdle program that places as many barriers to food-borne illness as we can,\u201d says Gary Thomas, the company\u2019s senior vice president for integrated supply chain. Earthbound now conducts 200,000 tests annually on its ready-to-eat greens.Not everyone was as quick to embrace change; some growers were concerned about losing shelf life while they waited for results. Mr. Wilson was unmoved by that argument. \u201cIf you can test and verify microbial safety, what do I care if I lose shelf life?\u201d he says.The Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011, intended to improve food safety practices, has been mired in missed deadlines, which have been attributed to food-industry concerns about overregulation and to an unrealistic timeline given the scope of the overhaul. The delays led to a lawsuit by the Center for Food Safety and the Center for Environmental Health, two advocacy groups. The F.D.A. and the Office of Management and Budget now operate under a court-ordered schedule that requires regulations to be issued in late 2015 and 2016.The F.D.A. currently stops short of requiring produce tests, although it conducts its own \u201csurveillance sampling,\u201d according to Juli Putnam, an agency spokeswoman. The agency sees two drawbacks to mandatory tests: \u201cA negative product test result does not necessarily indicate the absence of a hazard,\u201d Ms. Putnam wrote in an email, because contamination might show up in another part of a field, and conducting more tests would increase the costs that are passed on to the consumer.The agency is focused instead on defining minimum safety standards for \u201cpotential sources of microbiological contamination such as agricultural water, worker health and hygiene and animals in the growing area,\u201d she wrote (though some preventive testing is conducted on sprouts).Mr. Wilson says he uses government guidelines \u201cas a minimum standard, and I always try to go above and beyond that.\u201dDNATrek, a newcomer to the field, sees opportunity in another aspect of food safety testing: the need to quickly pinpoint the source of a pathogen outbreak, to avoid delays and unnecessarily broad recalls. Anthony Zografos, the company\u2019s chief executive, says it soon plans to introduce a test called DNATrax, which will be able to identify the source of contaminated produce within an hour, narrowing recall efforts \u201cto a specific field or packer or distributor.\u201d The test relies on tracer DNA that is dissolved in the liquid coating applied to many types of produce after harvest or added to prepared foods; it provides a unique genetic fingerprint.George Farquar, a chemist and Mr. Zografos\u2019s partner in the company, was looking for ways to trace airborne contaminants as part of a national security project financed by the Defense Department when he realized that the work could be applied to food safety. He and Mr. Zografos licensed the technology from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where he was conducting the research, and it will receive royalties from sales of the test. Mr. Zografos says that DNATrax will offer traceability for most types of field produce at a price of about $1 for 1,000 pounds.Tracking Down FraudFood safety is a yes-or-no proposition \u2014 either there is a contaminant or there isn\u2019t. Food fraud, a smaller segment of the universe of problem foods, is harder to detect because it can take so many forms. Fish from a country whose imports have been banned might arrive at the market labeled with a different country of origin, honey might be cut with cheaper extenders, and saffron might not even be saffron.When asked if fake food has ever crossed the threshold at Costco, Mr. Wilson smiles and says, \u201cI\u2019m going to go with \u2018no,\u2019 but you\u2019re not going to believe me entirely. Yes, there have been egregious things, and we\u2019ve taken care of them, and that\u2019s that.\u201dOlive oil is a popular target for fraud because there are several ways to charge more for less. Compliance with United States Department of Agriculture quality standards for extra-virgin olive oil is voluntary. Unless a supplier pays for testing, passes and puts a U.S.D.A.-certified sticker on the bottle, consumers have no way to know whether they got extra-virgin olive oil. Any grade of olive oil can be doctored with cheap filler oils like canola, because they have no flavor. And the country of origin listed on the label isn\u2019t always where the contents are from.About five years ago, Mr. Wilson decided it was time to send an employee to Tuscany to collect leaves from Tuscan olive trees. Costco now has an index of DNA information on \u201call the cultivars of Tuscan olive oil, about 16 different ones,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen they harvest and press, we do our DNA testing.\u201dA group of undergraduates at the University of California, Davis, has developed the OliView, a biosensor that can detect rancid or adulterated olive oil. They expect to have the device ready for sale, at $60 to $80, in 18 months to two years. \u201cAt the supermarket level, we found that a lot of times the oil was just old and rancid,\u201d says Selina Wang, research director at the U.C. Davis Olive Center and one of the students\u2019 advisers, \u201cbut there were also samples labeled extra virgin that were actually a little bit of virgin olive oil mixed with refined olive oil.\u201dAdulterated oil, more common among imports, can stump even food professionals. Ms. Wang says that at the center, they \u201chave seen samples with as much as 70 percent canola oil.\u201dDNATrek has also developed a test for products where fraud is a temptation \u2014 \u201chigh-value stuff, truffles, saffron, premium juices, honey, seafood and olive oil,\u201d Mr. Zografos says.Mr. Samadpour says that in multi-ingredient products, the source of trickery is usually hidden further down the food chain than the name on the package. \u201cIt\u2019s not the top people who get involved in economic adulteration,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s someone lower down who sees a way to save a penny here or there. Maybe it\u2019s 2 or 3 cents, but if you sell a million units, that\u2019s $20,000 to $30,000.\u201dConsumer VigilanceAs with most expanding technologies, there are believers and skeptics. David Gombas, senior vice president for food safety and technology at the 111-year-old United Fresh Produce Association, echoes the position of the Food and Drug Administration: Testing is not a sufficient answer for his members, who include anyone engaged in the fresh produce industry, \u201cfrom guys who come up with seeds to growers, shippers, fresh-cut processors, restaurants and grocery stores, everyone from beginning to end,\u201d from small organic farms to Monsanto.Their common ground, he says, is a commitment to food safety \u2014 but members disagree on how to achieve it, including Mr. Gombas and Mr. Samadpour, who are both microbiologists. \u201cMicrobiological testing provides a false sense of security,\u201d Mr. Gombas says. \u201cThey can find one dead salmonella cell on a watermelon, but what does that tell you about the rest of the watermelon in the field? Nothing.\u201dTesting has its place, he says, but as backup for \u201cgood practices and environmental monitoring,\u201d which includes things as diverse as employee hygiene and site visits. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of testing,\u201d he says, \u201cif something funny\u2019s going on.\u201d Otherwise, he has taken on the role of contrarian. \u201cPeople think testing means something. When I say it doesn\u2019t, they smile, nod and keep testing.\u201dMr. Samadpour says sampling \u201ccan reduce the risk tremendously but can never 100 percent eliminate it,\u201d but he will take a tremendous reduction over a food crisis any day. The government\u2019s \u201cindirect\u201d stance, which mandates safety but does not require testing, allows companies to interpret safe practices on \u201ca spectrum,\u201d he says, \u201cfrom bare minimum to sophisticated programs,\u201d and he worries about safety at the low end of that range.He says consumer vigilance is the best defense against the selling of groceries under bare minimum standards.IEH tested the contents of Mr. Samadpour\u2019s grocery cart:The organic raspberries showed 0.12 parts per million of spinosyn A, an insecticide available in both organic and synthetic formulations. Mr. Samadpour\u2019s test cannot distinguish between organic and synthetic spinosyn A, but the tolerance level is the same for both: 0.7 parts per million. Assuming the organic raspberries were treated with the organic formulation, the residue was well within tolerance.The beef and pork were cross-contaminated \u2014 each had amounts of the other \u2014 a common occurrence, he says, when markets grind first one batch of meat and then the other. These were small amounts as well, but their presence could upset a Muslim or Jewish customer who does not eat pork, or a Hindu who does not eat beef. The fish was what the label said it was.As for the cumin and the peanuts, the F.D.A. posted a handful of product recalls, all of them involving cumin and peanuts, including Kellogg\u2019s MorningStar Farms chipotle black bean burgers, which Mr. Wilson removed from Costco\u2019s shelves.The recalls continued for weeks, until the F.D.A. issued a blanket statement \u201cadvising people who are highly allergic to peanuts to consider avoiding products that contain ground cumin or cumin powder, because some shipments of these products have tested positive for undeclared peanut protein. People who are highly allergic or sensitive to peanuts may be at risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction.\u201dInside the labs, reaction was more world-weary than panicked; this was business as usual.\u201cOther than the label somebody\u2019s written,\u201d Mr. Farquar says, \u201cyou really have no idea where your food\u2019s coming from.\u201dMr. Samadpour, having been at this far longer, is more philosophical. \u201cI eat street food when I travel,\u201d he says. \u201cOne can\u2019t become a microbe-phobe.\u201dAn article last Sunday about private testing of grocery items for food safety misstated the type of E. coli that is a lethal threat in ground beef. It is E. coli O157, not 1057.An article on April 5 about private testing of grocery items for product safety misstated the tolerance limit for the insecticide spinosyn A on organic raspberries. Because spinosyn A is available in both organic and synthetic formulations, the tolerance level is identical on both organic and nonorganic berries at 0.7 parts per million; the limit is not 0.035 parts per million for organic berries. Assuming the organic berries tested by IEH Laboratories were treated with the organic formulation of spinosyn A, the test result of 0.12 parts per million was well within the tolerance; it did not exceed it. The test conducted by IEH cannot distinguish between the organic and synthetic formulations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pimco Hires Ben Bernanke as a Senior Adviser", "Date": "2015-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat Mr. Bernanke landed at asset-management firms based in Newport Beach, Calif., (Pimco) and Chicago (Citadel), highlights as well the extent to which power and influence in the markets are shifting away from classic Wall Street investment banks after the 2008 financial crisis.For example, when Robert E. Rubin was seeking to return to the private sector in 1999 after stepping down as Treasury secretary, he was lured to Citigroup by Sanford I. Weill, who was seen as a Wall Street kingmaker.As the country\u2019s largest bond investor, Pimco spends more time and energy than just about any other financial firm trying to guess the Fed\u2019s next move, and over the years its ties with the central bank have been close.From 2007 to 2011, Mr. Bernanke\u2019s predecessor, Alan Greenspan, worked as an adviser to the firm.And in late 2008, Pimco was among a few select investment firms to be hired by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to carry out its ambitious plan to buy billions of dollars of securitized mortgages to stimulate the economy.One area of focus for the council is whether large asset managers like Pimco and BlackRock should be designated as \u201csystemically important\u201d and thus be subjected to tighter regulation. Pimco and its peers have aggressively lobbied against such a designation.Mr. Bernanke, who is a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, will not be a formal Pimco employee. According to a person who was involved in the discussions between Pimco and Mr. Bernanke, his contract states that he will not seek to influence any person or organization in Washington with regard to matters important to Pimco.Terms of Mr. Bernanke\u2019s pay were not disclosed.Mr. Bernanke did not respond to a request for comment.The tremendous flow of funds to money-management firms \u2014 largely a result of Mr. Bernanke\u2019s unconventional bond-buying policies \u2014 has increased pressure on these institutions to generate high returns in a low-interest-rate environment.In that regard, Mr. Bernanke can provide an insider\u2019s edge while also serving as a A-list draw for big-ticket investors.In a statement, Pimco, which oversees $1.6 trillion, said that Mr. Bernanke would contribute his economic expertise to the firm\u2019s investment process and engage with clients.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Promising Nuclear Deal With Iran", "Date": "2015-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe preliminary agreement between Iran and the major powers is a significant achievement that makes it more likely Iran will never be a nuclear threat. President Obama said it would \u201ccut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon.\u201dIt would roll back Iran\u2019s nuclear program sufficiently so that Iran could not quickly produce a nuclear weapon, and ensure that, if Iran cheated, the world would have at least one year to take preventive action, including reimposing sanctions. In return, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations would lift sanctions crippling Iran\u2019s economy, though the timing of such a move is yet another uncertainty. Iran would shut down roughly two-thirds of the 19,000 centrifuges producing uranium that could be used to fuel a bomb and agree not to enrich uranium over 3.67 percent (a much lower level than is required for a bomb) for at least 15 years. The core of the reactor at Arak, which officials feared could produce plutonium, another key ingredient for making a weapon, would be dismantled and replaced, with the spent fuel shipped out of Iran.Mr. Obama, speaking at the White House, insisted he was not relying on trust to ensure Iran\u2019s compliance but on \u201cthe most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear program.\u201d There is good reason for skepticism about Iran\u2019s intentions. Although it pledged not to acquire nuclear weapons when it ratified the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1970, it pursued a secret uranium enrichment program for two decades. By November 2013, when serious negotiations with the major powers began, Iran was enriching uranium at a level close to bomb-grade. However, Iran has honored an interim agreement with the major powers, in place since January 2014, by curbing enrichment and other major activities. By opening a dialogue between Iran and America, the negotiations have begun to ease more than 30 years of enmity. Over the long run, an agreement could make the Middle East safer and offer a path for Iran, the leading Shiite country, to rejoin the international community. The deal, if signed and carried out, would vindicate the political risks taken by President Hassan Rouhani of Iran and President Obama to engage after decades of estrangement starting from the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Talking to adversaries \u2014 as President Ronald Reagan did in nuclear weapons negotiations with the Soviets and President Richard Nixon did in his opening to China \u2014 is something American leaders have long pursued as a matter of practical necessity and prudence. Yet in today\u2019s poisonous political climate, Mr. Obama\u2019s critics have gone to extraordinary lengths to undercut him and any deal. Their belligerent behavior is completely out of step with the American public, which overwhelmingly favors a negotiated solution with Iran, unquestionably the best approach.Sunni Arab nations and Israel are deeply opposed to any deal, fearing that it would strengthen Iran\u2019s power in the region. This agreement addresses the nuclear program, the most urgent threat, and does not begin to tackle Iran\u2019s disruptive role in Syria and elsewhere. Iran is widely seen as a threat; whether it can get beyond that will depend on whether its leaders choose to be less hostile to its neighbors, including Israel. Advertisement"}

There\u2019s an App for That", "Date": "2015-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Money Issue\u201cThat\u2019s when I\u2019m desperate,\u201d she said, \u201cgoing everywhere I can, just to find people to rub.\u201dLeibrock wanted to know everything about Jacobs\u2019s financial life. Jacobs gamely obliged, though at times she became flustered or teary. Thinking about money gives her a jolt, \u201clike you\u2019re about to get into a car accident,\u201d she later told me. There\u2019s the $3,700 for massage-\u00adschool tuition that she still owes on her credit card; the $60 a month for drugs for her anxiety and bipolar disorder, which she might skimp on again; the old debt she is paying down for her husband, a student and part-\u00adtime delivery driver for a Red\u2019s BBQ. Splurge on Walmart groceries this week or stick to the dollar store? Because bills come like clockwork and income does not, Jacobs never knows.Though Even is based in Oakland, it is staffed by big brains from Facebook, Google and Instagram and is funded by Silicon Valley A-\u00adlisters like Khosla Ventures. Its founders are betting, with typical Silicon Valley ambition, that a for-\u00adprofit, venture-\u00adcapital-\u00adbacked safety net can counteract the stagnant wages, erratic hours, defanged unions, ballooning debt, nonexistent sick leave and usurious lending that bedevil lives like Heather Jacobs\u2019s and make America arguably the worst place in the rich world to be poor. Or, to put it in Palo Alto patois, they want to take the human disruption caused by disruption and, well, disrupt it.The company\u2019s founders believe that the stress of poverty flows more from the irregularity of income than from its dearth \u2014 from the inability to make and keep plans. Jacobs and that stress are intimately acquainted. There are the minor panic attacks she suffers, the feeling of being punched in the windpipe, when a financial matter crosses her mind. There are the full-\u00adon panic attacks that come when she skips her medicine to save money. There\u2019s her teeth-\u00adgrinding at night and a recurring unsubtle dream in which a relative is holding some money and judging her. There is the weight she puts on, and the morning body aches, when she gets the salt- and sugar-\u00adrich dollar-\u00adstore groceries instead of the pricier Walmart ones. And she sees no escape. She told Leibrock, \u201cI\u2019m pretty much working every day for the rest of my life.\u201dLeibrock most likely isn\u2019t, not least because she is so good at her job. \u201cRight there with you,\u201d she said.The thing that kept coming to him was his childhood obsession with the reality-\u00adtelevision show \u201cCops,\u201d and specifically the sad subset of perps who would show up again and again. How could some people, he had always wondered, make such \u201cdumb decisions\u201d as to be arrested not once but twice by the police unit that happened to have a TV crew riding along? \u201cI didn\u2019t get it, and I wanted to,\u201d he told me. That curiosity about decision-\u00admaking fueled a boyhood fantasy of being a forensic psychologist for the F.B.I., and in fact he went on to study psychology at Skidmore. When he became interested in money in his 20s, he took a job as a product developer at Bonobos, the men\u2019s-clothing website, where he became fascinated by how tiny tweaks to the checkout process could alter customer behavior and lift sales.The researchers tested this theory with an experiment. They approached people in a New Jersey mall and asked them a hypothetical financial question: \u201cYour car is having some trouble and requires $X to be fixed. You can pay in full, take a loan or take a chance and forgo the service at the moment.\u201d While the subjects considered the financial question, they were given unrelated, nonfinancial cognitive tests. Among those subjects randomly given a small X \u2014 say, $150 \u2014 people who reported a low income performed about as well on the nonfinancial cognitive tests as people who reported a high income. Among those randomly assigned to a larger X \u2014 say, $1,500 \u2014 the poor did much worse on the tests than the rich. The authors concluded that the mere thought of financial peril could tax poor people\u2019s smarts. The drop was equivalent to 13 I.Q. points, comparable to the effects of losing a night\u2019s sleep or becoming a chronic alcoholic.The study stayed with Schlossberg and led him to other research, about how poverty\u2019s stresses alter hormones and bias people toward short-\u00adterm rewards over long-\u00adterm ones. Soon he was dreaming of start-\u00adup ideas, he told me: \u201cHow could I succeed in building a company that reduces stress for poor people?\u201dIf Schlossberg is intense and inward, Farmer, 24, is the laid-\u00adback friend you might ask for thoughtful advice or marijuana. A more important contrast is that Farmer knows about hardship. He grew up on Whidbey Island in Washington State, his mother a homemaker, his father a mechanical engineer who provided a solid middle-\u00adclass life \u2014 until their divorce. Soon his mother was waiting tables and cleaning houses. At 15, Farmer began working to chip in, first as a dishwasher at the Oystercatcher restaurant, then as a farmhand, spending days knee-\u00addeep in dirt, cleaning garlic, the scent of which never seemed to leave him.Schlossberg had never heard of income volatility. Farmer told him about choppy income and how the timing of money could be a bigger problem than the quantity.Schlossberg argues that Even is different from predatory lenders, because it has only one revenue stream: the $3 weekly fees, which it stops earning if a user goes too far into arrears and is suspended. He says that Even will never invest people\u2019s deposits to earn additional money and that it has no plans to make money in any other way. But investors crave only growth, and a $3 weekly fee may not satiate them. Jacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale who literally wrote the book on income volatility, \u201cThe Great Risk Shift\u201d (2006), says he finds Even \u201cdeeply attractive.\u201d But he worries that future investors, seeing in it the next Uber or Amazon, might pressure it to cross-\u00adsell other financial products, \u201csteering vulnerable consumers to products that weren\u2019t ideal for them.\u201dThe company is now seeking partnerships with large employers who might offer Even to their part-\u00adtime employees as \u201ca subsidized benefit, akin to health insurance or financial wellness programs,\u201d Schlossberg says, allowing them to stabilize their incomes, if not their chaotic hours or day-\u00adcare plans. Schlossberg says this is all still up in the air, but another Even founder, Cem Kent, the son of Coca-\u00adCola\u2019s chief executive, Muhtar Kent, has taken on the task of hobnobbing some partnerships into being. In such cases, would Even still be a service devoted to helping the working poor? Or would it just be helping companies more easily and guiltlessly employ workers erratically?Schlossberg asks, \u201cBecause some might do bad, does that mean we should not do good?\u201dThere are also questions about Even\u2019s own financial health. What happens when users lose jobs, start earning less or just skip out? Schlossberg says Even chooses users carefully and, with its non\u00adaverage average, has a buffer. The hope is that most users will be lending themselves money in bad weeks, not borrowing from Even.Lisa Servon, a professor of urban policy at the New School, has done extensive research on payday lenders, including working undercover for more than four months at such establishments in Oakland and the Bronx. I asked her about Even\u2019s prospects. She said its success would depend on its skill in distinguishing between two kinds of users: those who use \u201cpayday and overdraft and other forms of expensive credit because of income volatility\u201d and those who simply don\u2019t \u201chave enough money to make ends meet \u2014 period.\u201d Payday lenders make a fortune from those without enough money, but such users would be anathema to Even\u2019s self-insurance model. \u201cThe key for Even will be to have a good filter,\u201d Servon told me.In other words, for Even to thrive, it will probably need to avoid the truly needy: those who don\u2019t have enough ever, not merely right now. Picking winners also means picking \u2014 and spurning \u2014 losers. Even\u2019s purpose is hardly to change the distribution of wealth in society. It is simply to redistribute one person\u2019s own limited wealth across time. People in Silicon Valley may believe there\u2019s an app for everything. That\u2019s their hammer. But improving the lot of the poor will require other tools, including an old one the valley often wants to wish away: politics.Anand Giridharadas is a columnist for The International New York Times and the author, most recently, of \u201cThe True American: Murder and Mercy in Texas.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Won\u2019t people just vote for the candidate from their party anyway?It\u2019s a question that political scientists and political consultants like to debate. As most political scientists can tell you, more than 90 percent of people who declared a party allegiance voted for the presidential nominee from their party in 2012. But there\u2019s some evidence that consultants are right, too: While most people stick with their party, who gets the nod can sometimes significantly affect a party\u2019s share of the vote, and in close elections can even affect the outcome.The power in this survey design comes from holding everything about the election constant except the choices on the ballot. The economy is the same; the incumbent party has the same level of performance; and foreign imbroglios exist and do not change as we altered the set of candidates to voters. Think of the approach as if it were an episode of \u201cDr. Who\u201d or \u201cStar Trek,\u201d in which we get to go to a parallel universe and run the last presidential election with the same voters and the same national context, but with different candidates. If there are differences in vote share, we can be fairly sure they are due to the switching of the candidates.In January 2012, we asked people about a few more candidates. Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry were among them. Both Mrs. Bachmann and Mr. Perry fared worse than all of the previously mentioned candidates. Mr. Perry earned roughly 40 percent of the two-party vote in hypothetical matchups with Mr. Obama, and Mrs. Bachmann did significantly worse than that.The other pattern worth noting: More ideologically extreme candidates fared worse than moderate candidates. This pattern could be specific to 2012 or part of a larger trend \u2014 we don\u2019t have enough data from modern primary contests to tell \u2014 but the general election candidacies of George McGovern in 1972 and Barry Goldwater in 1964 lend support to the possibility that ideologically extreme candidates have a harder time in general elections.For some candidates, their records and reputations are so well developed that by the time they announce their candidacy there is little they can do to convince primary voters that they are viable in a general election contest \u2014 a criterion upon which primary voters, at least in 2012, put value.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Drought Tests History of Endless Growth", "Date": "2015-04-04", "News": "The Parched WestA punishing drought is forcing a reconsideration of whether the aspiration of untrammeled growth that has for so long been the state\u2019s engine has run against the limits of nature.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 For more than a century, California has been the state where people flocked for a better life \u2014 164,000 square miles of mountains, farmland and coastline, shimmering with ambition and dreams, money and beauty. It was the cutting-edge symbol of possibility: Hollywood, Silicon Valley, aerospace, agriculture and vineyards.But now a punishing drought \u2014 and the unprecedented measures the state announced last week to compel people to reduce water consumption \u2014 is forcing a reconsideration of whether the aspiration of untrammeled growth that has for so long been this state\u2019s driving engine has run against the limits of nature.This state has survived many a catastrophe before \u2014 and defied the doomsayers who have regularly proclaimed the death of the California dream \u2014 as it emerged, often stronger, from the challenges of earthquakes, an energy crisis and, most recently, a budgetary collapse that forced years of devastating cuts in spending. These days, the economy is thriving, the population is growing, the state budget is in surplus, and development is exploding from Silicon Valley to San Diego; the evidence of it can be seen in the construction cranes dotting the skylines of Los Angeles and San Francisco.Can Los Angeles continue to dominate as the country\u2019s capital of entertainment and glamour, and Silicon Valley as the center of high tech, if people are forbidden to take a shower for more than five minutes and water bills become prohibitively expensive? Will tourists worry about coming? Will businesses continue their expansion in places like San Francisco and Venice?\u201cMother Nature didn\u2019t intend for 40 million people to live here,\u201d said Kevin Starr, a historian at the University of Southern California who has written extensively about this state. \u201cThis is literally a culture that since the 1880s has progressively invented, invented and reinvented itself. At what point does this invention begin to hit limits?\u201dCalifornia, Dr. Starr said, \u201cis not going to go under, but we are going to have to go in a different way.\u201dAn estimated 38.8 million people live in California today, more than double the 15.7 million people who lived here in 1960, and the state\u2019s labor force exploded to 18.9 million in 2013 from 6.4 million people in 1960.\u201cYou just can\u2019t live the way you always have,\u201d said Mr. Brown, a Democrat who is in his fourth term as governor.\u201cFor over 10,000 years, people lived in California, but the number of those people were never more than 300,000 or 400,000,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cNow we are embarked upon an experiment that no one has ever tried: 38 million people, with 32 million vehicles, living at the level of comfort that we all strive to attain. This will require adjustment. This will require learning.\u201dAn interactive map shows how much water California residents conserved in April and how much daily consumption they are being forced to cut under new mandatory restrictions.This disconnect, as it were, can be seen in places like Palm Springs, in the middle of the desert, where daily per capita water use is 201 gallons \u2014 more than double the state average. A recent drive through the community offered a drought-defying tableau of burbling fountains, flowers, lush lawns, golf courses and trees. The smell of mowed lawn was in the air.But the drought is now forcing change in a place that long identified itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s desert oasis.\u201d Palm Springs has ordered 50 percent cuts in water use by city agencies, and plans to replace the lawns and annual flowers around city buildings with native landscapes. It is digging up the grassy median into town that unfurled before visitors like a carpet at a Hollywood premiere. It is paying residents to replace their lawns with rocks and desert plants, and offering rebates to people who install low-flow toilets.At the airport that once welcomed winter-chilled tourists with eight acres of turf and flowers, city officials are in the early stages of replacing the grass with cactus, desert bushes and paloverde trees. The city had hoped to replace the entire lawn, but the project\u2019s $2 million price tag forced it to begin instead with three acres, said David Ready, the city manager.\u201cYears ago the idea was, come to Palm Springs, and people see the grass and the lushness and the green,\u201d Mr. Ready said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to change the way we consume water.\u201cFallow FieldsOther places face different threats to their way of life. Mayor Robert Silva of Mendota, in the heart of the agricultural Central Valley, said unemployment among farmworkers had soared as the soil turned to crust and farmers left half or more of their fields fallow. Many people are traveling 60 or 70 miles to look for work, Mr. Silva said, and families are increasingly relying on food donations.\u201cYou can\u2019t pay the bills with free food,\u201d he said. \u201cGive me some water, and I know I can go to work, that\u2019s the bottom line.\u201dRichard White, a history professor at Stanford University, said the scarcity of water could result in a decline in housing construction, at a time when there has been a burst of desperately needed residential development in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder and harder to build new housing without an adequate water supply,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many developments can you afford if you don\u2019t have water?\u201d\u201cIf this gets out of control, I\u2019ll probably end up leaving,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThis has been a problem for as long as I\u2019ve been alive.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve watched this state get trampled by developers,\u201d he added. \u201cThey keep building homes, but where\u2019s the water going to come from?\u201dState officials signaled on Friday that reductions in water supplies for farmers were likely to be announced in the coming weeks, and there is also likely to be increased pressure on the farms to move away from certain water-intensive crops \u2014 like almonds.A New NormalMayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, pointing to Mr. Brown\u2019s executive order and his own city\u2019s success in reducing water consumption, said he was confident that the state would find ways to deal with an era of reduced water supplies, in a way that would permit it to continue to grow and thrive.\u201cWe have to deal with a new normal,\u201d Mr. Garcetti said. \u201cThat said, do we have enough water to sustain life here? Absolutely. Do we have enough water to grow economically? Absolutely.\u201d\u201cCities that are much drier and truly desert \u2014 Phoenix, Las Vegas \u2014 have shown the ability to have economic growth,\u201d he said.Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce, rejected the idea that the drought and the state\u2019s response to it would prompt industries to move away or stop adding jobs. \u201cThe rest of the economy is managing it, learning how to deal with it,\u201d he said.This is hardly the first crisis California has faced; there has always been a tension between the natural beauty and delights of living in California and the external threats, be they the dizzying ups-and-downs of the state budget, the rolling blackouts during the energy crisis in 2000 and 2001, the earthquakes or periodic droughts.\u201cPeople on the East Coast always want to say that the glow of California is gone,\u201d said Felicia Marcus, the head of the State Water Resources Control Board, which is putting into effect the 25 percent reduction in water use ordered by Mr. Brown last week. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. I don\u2019t see it as any diminishment about our prospect of growth. There has to be a more evolved way about using the resources we have. We have a long way to go before we have tapped out our resources.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to stop watering,\u201d said Matthew Post, 45, referring to the gardens around his Benedict Canyon home. \u201cThe state does not know how to arrange the resources they have, and so we have to pay for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say that they will raise the prices because there is a drought, but when the drought ends, will they reduce the prices?\u201dMuch like the Gold Rush more than 150 years ago or the rise of Silicon Valley, the assumption of cheap and abundant water has been a crucial part of California\u2019s identity, history and economy.And until recently, it seemed that the California dream was sustainable: booming cities, wide lawns in the suburbs, green golf courses in an otherwise parched landscape and, above all, a vibrant agricultural sector in places not much wetter than a desert.\u201cThe idea, at least until the latter part of the 20th century, was that water would be cheap and plentiful and the focus was on developing new supplies,\u201d said Heather Cooley, water program director for the Pacific Institute, an environmental research group based in Oakland. \u201cFolks realize we have now reached the limits of supply, so the focus is on demand.\u201dWhile the mandatory cuts in home water use are the first ever, efficiency has been slowly gaining ground in recent decades. Total water use in Los Angeles, San Francisco and many other urban areas is now lower than it was in 1980, despite the huge economic growth and population increases.The latest restrictions represent a cultural change, as well as a lifestyle one, going well beyond taking shorter showers or forgoing the Sunday afternoon ritual of hosing down the family car.Half of residential use is outdoors, primarily lawns, Ms. Cooley said. \u201cAnd what Californians see as beautiful,\u201d she said, \u201chas been a lawn that has been the standard for front yards and backyards.\u201dNow, with utilities paying people to replace thirsty traditional grass turf with water-sipping native plants and other drought-tolerant shrubbery, long-held aesthetics are shifting. \u201cThis will change what Californians see as beautiful,\u201d she said.But even a significant drop in residential water use will not move the consumption needle nearly as much as even a small reduction by farmers. Of all the surface water consumed in the state, roughly 80 percent is earmarked for the agricultural sector.\u201cThe big question is agriculture, and there are difficult trade-offs that need to be made,\u201d said Katrina Jessoe, assistant professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Davis.Bill Melzer, 72, a bond broker walking his dog on a sunny morning in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, said he was worried about the drought, about the prospect of higher fines for using too much water and about what might happen to the agriculture industry. But he said he was not worried about the future of his state.\u201cThe dream of California now is probably different than back in the 1960s,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s more financial opportunity. I think before it was what we\u2019re looking at now \u2014 great weather, beach weather, tremendous diversity of lifestyle. Really, if you cannot find your lifestyle in this state, there is something wrong with you.\u201dDr. Starr, the University of Southern California historian, said the crisis would force California to do what was needed to carry on. \u201cOur destiny is not just to be a fantasy place,\u201d he said. \u201cAs much as we enjoy the good life in California, we have to come to terms with Mother Nature, with our arid environment.\u201d\u201cEvery time California has a problem \u2014 we ran out of electricity in the early 2000s, then we ran out of money, and now we are running out of water \u2014 people say California is over,\u201d Dr. Starr said. \u201cIt\u2019s not over. It\u2019s too important a part of American culture to be over. But it will change itself.\u201dAdam Nagourney and Jack Healy reported from Los Angeles, and Nelson D. Schwartz from New York. Emma G.

{"Headline": "Technology Overtakes Tobacco in Winston-Salem, N.C.", "Date": "2015-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetAn overview of the Wake Forest Innovation Quarter district. Bailey Park, at center, opened recently and will host music events, food trucks and more.That business park, Research Triangle Park, is a collection of spacious office buildings housing 170 companies on a 7,000-acre suburban campus navigated by car. It fit two of the primary real estate priorities of the postwar 20th century: mobility and privacy.Here in Winston-Salem, about 80 miles west, the technology business park is being updated to fit two development priorities of the 21st century: proximity and collaboration.The irony of the Innovation Quarter\u2019s focus on data analysis, biotech health research and medical education is not lost on the project\u2019s developers. Neither is the design emphasis on light and air.Skylights and spacious interior atriums open the dark, early 20th-century, multistory concrete factory buildings. The $517.5 million development also features new construction to house state-of-the art biomedical laboratories and classrooms. In all, the Innovation Quarter encompasses 2.5 million square feet of office, laboratory, classroom and residential space in 16 buildings surrounding an urban square.Much of the construction has occurred since 2011, when the $106 million, 242,000-square-foot Biotech Place, a former tobacco plant, was completed. The quarter\u2019s accelerated construction schedule the last two years also was hastened by the need to get projects started before North Carolina\u2019s tax credits for historic building restoration expired on Jan. 1 this year. Two years ago, the state Legislature voted to end the credits, which provided over $140 million in investment capital for the Innovation Quarter, said Daniel C. Cramer, the senior vice president for development at Wexford Science and Technology.Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, supports reviving the state tax credits, which have provided over $1 billion in capital to rebuild warehouses, textile plants and other historic structures across the state, according to state figures. Negotiations on a compromise plan are in progress in Raleigh.Work on the Innovation Quarter started in 1986, when R.J. Reynolds Tobacco moved its downtown operations to a modern manufacturing center 15 miles north of the city. The company sold a portion of its former site to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center for $1 million. R.J. Reynolds has since donated the rest of the downtown plant\u2019s land and buildings.The medical center, jointly owned and overseen by Wake Forest University and North Carolina Baptist Hospital, is the city\u2019s largest private employer. It envisioned expanding its presence downtown and built the $13 million, 100,000-square-foot Piedmont Triad Community Research Center, the first of a tight collection of seven new and renovated research, office and residential buildings that cost $51.6 million and encompassed 519,000 square feet. Within walking distance were neighborhoods full of rental housing.Before the Great Recession brought construction to a standstill, two more buildings were added to the development, including space for a $13 million, 30,000-square-foot medical data center. In the last four years, four more projects were completed, including a $25 million renovation of Plant 64 into 243 residential units. The five-story, 253,000-square-foot building, opened in 1916, is the oldest of the R.J. Reynolds plants still standing in the complex.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that we needed more space,\u201d said John D. McConnell, the chief executive of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. \u201cWe wanted to create an ecosystem. The idea was to build a place with a lot of intellectual energy and make it possible for people to work here and live a few blocks away.\u201dThe Wake Forest development is a facet of what Bruce Katz, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution in Washington, calls the \u201cinnovation economy\u201d that is developing in American cities. \u201cWhether they are in small, medium-size or large cities, developers can make smart decisions and cities can recharge their economies by building corridors of technology-based companies in their downtowns,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cWe see them developing all over. What\u2019s happening in Winston-Salem is emblematic of the big forces that are reshaping the country\u2019s cities.\u201dFrom 1875, when Richard Joshua Reynolds founded the company that bore his name, through most of the 20th century, Winston-Salem moved with the rhythm of the tobacco harvest and the shifting domestic market for cigarette sales. During World War II, 15,000 people worked in the buildings the company owned on the city\u2019s east side.The hotel development, said Mayor Allen Joines, was influenced by the Wake Forest project, two blocks away. The city, he said, is intent on forming medicine, information management and biotechnology into a new brand for Winston-Salem. \u201cSince 2000, we\u2019ve had $1.2 billion in real estate investment in our downtown,\u201d Mayor Joines said. \u201cThe Innovation Quarter has been a big part of why that\u2019s happened.\u201d\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is economic development plus social engineering,\u201d added Eric Tomlinson, president of Wake Forest Innovation Quarter, the development\u2019s manager. \u201cWe try to capture the basic activities of life. Work. Live. Learn. Play.\u201dThat same formula also is driving the new development strategy in Research Triangle Park, which announced last year that it had purchased 100 acres close to the park\u2019s center for a development including retail, offices, recreation and residences, encompassing 3 million to 6 million square feet and all within walking distance.In Winston-Salem, 3,000 people work at the Innovation Quarter. Almost a third are employed at Inmar, a homegrown data analytics and services company that last fall moved its headquarters to 635 Vine Street, a 240,000-square-foot, four-story former tobacco processing building renovated at a cost of $75 million.\u201cWe looked very hard at different places to locate,\u201d said L. David Mounts, Inmar\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe decided to stay here in Winston-Salem. The space works. It helps us attract top talent. It\u2019s so good to see old buildings repurposed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Approves a Bill on Changes to Medicare", "Date": "2015-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved sweeping changes in the way Medicare pays doctors, clearing the bill for President Obama and resolving an issue that has bedeviled Congress and the Medicare program for more than a decade.The bill, drafted in the House in negotiations between Speaker John A. Boehner and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, also extends the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program for two years, through 2017.Without action by Congress, doctors would have faced a 21 percent cut in Medicare fees on Wednesday or Thursday. Senate leaders cleared the way for final passage by allowing votes on several amendments sought by liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans.Medicare spent $70 billion last year under the fee schedule used to pay doctors and some other health care professionals. That accounts for about 12 percent of all Medicare spending. Ninety-eight percent of people enrolled in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program receive at least one physician service during the year.The legislation moves Medicare in a direction espoused by Mr. Obama and many health policy experts, toward payment based on the quality and value of care, rather than just the volume of services. Organized medicine now accepts that change in principle, and the American Medical Association lobbied strongly for the bill, demanding that Congress \u201cfix Medicare now.\u201dCongress has passed 17 short-term bills since 2003 to block cuts in Medicare doctors\u2019 fees that were called for under the existing law. Such cuts would most likely prompt some doctors to accept fewer Medicare patients. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said the bill taken up Tuesday was \u201cdesigned to ensure that seniors on Medicare don\u2019t lose access to their doctors.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a solution to a broken Medicare payment system that has vexed congressional leaders of both parties for years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would mean an end to the annual exercise of Congress passing a temporary fix to the problem one year and then coming right up to the very same cliff the next year, without actually solving the underlying problem.\u201dSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, called the bill \u201ca milestone for Medicare.\u201d But he and other Democrats said it would have been better to extend the children\u2019s insurance program for four years, rather than two.Mr. Wyden said the current formula for paying doctors was \u201chorrendously flawed\u201d but had \u201cdominated much of the discussion\u201d in the last 18 years.Before passing the bill, the Senate rejected a half-dozen proposed amendments on Tuesday night. Democrats, for example, wanted to provide more money for women\u2019s health care. Republicans wanted to repeal a provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires most Americans to have health insurance, and they tried to force Congress to pay for the Medicare bill so it would not increase budget deficits.The current payment formula, set by Congress in 1997, links Medicare spending on doctors\u2019 services to growth of the overall economy. Medicare spending has regularly exceeded the targets. Under the law, the excess is supposed to be recouped in subsequent years through cuts in payment rates for doctors.The bill would repeal that formula. Fiscal conservatives object because only one-third of the cost would be offset. The rest, $141 billion from 2015 to 2025, would add to federal budget deficits.\u201cThis bill is not paid for,\u201d said Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama. New spending would total $211 billion over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office estimated. Higher-income Medicare beneficiaries would pay additional premiums totaling nearly $35 billion, and Medicare would save a similar amount by trimming payments to hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies.Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, said the bill \u201cdoubles down on Medicare\u2019s broken price control model\u201d and \u201cinflates the administration\u2019s power as regulator and compliance officer.\u201d\u201cThe principal change proposed in this bill is to move from a Medicare payment system based on volume to one based on bureaucratic measures of quality and value,\u201d Mr. Lee said.The votes against the bill came from Republicans: Mr. Sessions and Mr. Lee, along with Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, David Perdue of Georgia, Marco Rubio of Florida, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Tim Scott of South Carolina and Richard C. Shelby of Alabama.For a few hours on Tuesday, it seemed senators might also be close to an agreement to vote on Mr. Obama\u2019s nomination of Loretta E.

The proposal would require an annual third-party review of the repair and maintenance records of all blowout preventers, to ensure that the equipment continues to meet the original design criteria. It would require real-time monitoring of blowout preventers, to be conducted both aboard the oil rig and onshore.The rule would require all rigs to use new technology intended to center a drill in undersea wells during drilling, and it would also require safety inspections for every well in the Gulf of Mexico every two weeks. The new rule is the third new regulation proposed by the Obama administration in response to the disaster. In 2010, the Interior Department announced a new regulation on the casings of drilling wells, and in 2012, it announced a new regulation on the cementing of wells.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greece and I.M.F. Hold Talks on Crucial Debt Payment", "Date": "2015-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs a crucial date approaches for Greece to make a major debt payment, the markets are yet again weighing the possibility that the country could actually default on its loans.Such an outcome \u2014 a decision by the Greek government not to pay its creditors \u2014 has generally been seen as remote, even since the left-wing Syriza government came to power in January.But now, after months of bitter, inconclusive negotiations over the austerity measures Greece would have to impose to secure desperately needed cash from Europe, Greek government officials are grappling with very limited options for handling their cash squeeze.On April 9, Greece must pay 458 million euros, about $503 million, to the International Monetary Fund, a date and sum that in recent weeks have come to loom large for investors, many of whom worry how the markets would absorb a messy Greek default.Adding to these concerns was the abrupt decision by Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, to fly to Washington and meet with the I.M.F.\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, on Sunday.Following the meeting Ms. Lagarde said she welcomed \u201cconfirmation by the minister that payment owing to the fund would be forthcoming on April 9th.\u201d Mr. Varoufakis said that Greece would meet all its obligations, although neither party provided details in terms of how Greece would secure the funds to make this happen.Greece has said on numerous occasions that it has the money to pay the I.M.F. this week. Moreover, Mr. Varoufakis, from the moment he became finance minister this year, has gone out of his way to cultivate ties with Ms. Lagarde and has said that paying the fund was a priority for Greece.Over the last month, however, the economic situation in Greece has worsened greatly. Deposits worth about \u20ac25 billion have been withdrawn from Greek banks, some of which are now on life support with the European Central Bank.The government\u2019s tax collections are also suffering as companies and consumers fret over the prospect that Greece might be forced to abandon the euro.Now, with Europe refusing to permit Greece access to temporary lines of liquidity \u2014 such as letting its banks issue more short-term treasury notes \u2014 Greece is running out of cash. Which means that if it were to pay the fund \u20ac458 million this Thursday, there might not be enough left to pay pensions and public sector wages the next week, some Greek officials say.Mr. Varoufakis, who came to power on a platform of ending the policy of putting the needs of Greece\u2019s creditors above its suffering citizens, was to make the case to Ms. Lagarde that his government could not meet all of its commitments.\u201cThis government has made strong statements that they will meet their commitments,\u201d said a person involved in the negotiations but not authorized to speak publicly. The problem is, this person said, Greek officials have made commitments to their own people as well. \u201cThey are being pushed to the wall.\u201dThere is some wiggle room. Even if Greece does not pay up on Thursday, it will not be in technical default as there is a 30-day grace period that could allow the government to pay its pension and wage obligations and strike a broader deal so that its creditors could disburse the needed funds.Mr. Varoufakis is also planning to meet with officials in the United States Treasury on Monday in the hope that the United States, as the dominant voice at the I.M.F., might pressure fund officials, and Europe as well, to cut Greece some slack.The United States has been quietly critical of Europe\u2019s harsh stance toward Greece, warning of the consequences that a Greek default and exit from the euro would have on financial markets.Not paying the I.M.F. could set off defaults in the billions of euros that Greece owes its European lenders.All told, Greece owes \u20ac320 billion, with close to \u20ac20 billion in payments coming due in the next six months.Since the I.M.F. was founded in 1945, developed nations have made good on their debts. But there have been numerous cases in which countries with troubled economies, like Argentina, have ended up in arrears.\u201cOf all the possible steps the Greeks could take to manage their immediate cash flow crunch, default on the I.M.F. would be the most serious,\u201d said Peter Doyle, an independent economist who worked for many years in the fund\u2019s European department. \u201cIt would be tantamount to a declaration of \u2018war\u2019 by the Greeks.\u201dWhile there were many conventional proposals dealing with labor reforms and improved tax collection, aimed at appeasing the country\u2019s lenders, the policy menu included items like adding extra pension payments to low-income Greeks that are unlikely to please the country\u2019s austerity-obsessed counterparts.At the same time, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has scheduled a visit to Moscow to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia this week, increasing speculation that Greece is looking elsewhere for ways out of its cash squeeze. But with its own economy is in dire straits, Russia may not be in a position to rescue Greece financially.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rights Measures Expose Divisions in G.O.P.\u2019s Ranks", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In Indiana, the Republican mayor of Indianapolis argued against the law the Republican governor had signed. In Ohio, a group called the Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry tried to remove antigay language from the party platform. In Arkansas, the Republican governor faced a backlash from business and asked the Republican-led legislature to recall a bill seen as discriminatory to same-sex couples.The Republican Party is in the middle of an argument with itself. State laws seen as discriminatory against gay couples have laid bare and intensified longtime divisions in the party between social conservatives opposed to gay rights and the pro-business wing of the party that sees economic peril in the fight.\u00a0The divisions were on particular display Wednesday in Little Rock, Ark., where Asa Hutchinson, the Republican governor, called on state lawmakers to either recall or amend legislation billed as a religious freedom measure so that it mirrored a federal law approved in 1993. The Indiana law has touched off a storm of protests from businesses, local governments and college athletics.\u201cThis is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said. \u201cBut these are not ordinary times.\u201d\u201cBy the end of the week, I think Indiana will be in the right place, which is to say that we need in a big diverse country like America, we need to have space for people to act on their conscience, that it is a constitutional right that religious freedom is a core value of our country,\u201d Mr. Bush said.But in Iowa, Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who is running for president, strongly defended Mr. Pence. \u201cReligious liberty is not some cockamamie new theory that the Indiana legislature just figured out yesterday,\u201d Mr. Cruz said to a standing-room-only crowd at Morningside College in Sioux City. \u201cIt was literally among the founding principles of our nation, and we have to be able to explain that cheerfully and with a smile.\u201dMost other likely Republican presidential candidates have supported the Indiana law, but some major business groups, nervous about a perception that the party is antigay, have criticized it. In another sign of the divisions, 11 Senate Republicans voted last week to assure the approval of a budget amendment providing Social Security and veterans benefits to gay couples.Many others, especially Senate candidates up for re-election in swing states, are siding with groups that want to extend rights to gay couples.\u201cLife comes down to who you love and who loves you back, and government has no place in the middle,\u201d said Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois, and one of the 11 Republicans to vote for the budget amendment. \u201cMarried same-sex couples deserve equal treatment under the law, including when it comes to their Social Security and veterans benefits.\u201dMr. Kirk was the lead Republican sponsor of an employment Non-Discrimination Act, which passed the Senate in the 113th Congress. Others who voted for the measure, sponsored by Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, were Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Rob Portman of Ohio, Republicans who are expected to face tough re-election fights next year.The United States Chamber of Commerce, the nation\u2019s largest business organization, said in a statement: \u201cThe U.S. Chamber doesn\u2019t condone discrimination of any kind, in any form. We support those legislative leaders in Indiana and Arkansas who seek to clarify the law to protect this same principle.\u201dOther Republican-dominated states have moved in a different direction from Indiana and Arkansas. In Utah, the Republican governor signed a bill that extends state antidiscrimination protection to gays in the areas of housing and employment, a measure passed by a Republican legislature and supported by the Mormon Church.The current battle in Indiana was presaged in 2014, when Gov. Jan Brewer, Republican of Arizona, came under intense pressure from the business community and the National Football League and vetoed Senate Bill 1062, which would have changed state law in ways similar to Indiana. Ms. Brewer cited \u201cunintended and negative consequences\u201d of the bill.The tug of war between social and business-minded conservatives has been long simmering, and surfaced even when President Bush sought to privatize Social Security and some social conservatives feared the move would drive women into the work force.The issue of abortion has provided another flash point. While there is more unity among Republicans in opposing abortion rights, many would prefer to instead steer the conversation toward the economy, health care and national security.\u201cThere is no doubt that the continued opposition of gay rights is an electoral loser,\u201d he added. \u201cYounger Republicans are as pro-life as older Republicans, but gay rights is a huge generational shift and Republicans are going to have to find a way to deal with that issue.\u201dSupport for same-sex marriage has steadily grown over the last decade, a startling turnaround from a period when Republicans used ballot measures opposing same-sex marriage to drive turnout in some states, including Ohio. Now, 52 percent of Americans support gay marriage, according to a Pew Research Center poll, compared with 40 percent who oppose it; in 2001, Americans opposed it by a 57 percent to 35 percent margin in the same poll. But how the issue resonates with voters in 2016 remains unclear. \u201cIt is not going to be the kind of thing that 2016 candidates will put at the top of their agenda,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a Republican political consultant. \u201cThe biggest issues among candidates will be the ones among voters, which are the economy, health care, education, ISIS, national security and so on.\u201dMr. Francis, a management consultant, dropped his Republican affiliation after the battles in 2006 over the marriage issue and married a man. \u201cWe gave it our best effort and failed,\u201d he said of his earlier efforts. \u201cI think the jury is still out on whether the Republican Party will be able to resolve this chasm before the coming generation of millennials are completely gone.\u201dReporting was contributed by Vindu Goel from East Palo Alto, Calif., Maggie Haberman from New York, and Nick Corasaniti from Sioux City, Iowa.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saudis Should Welcome the Iran Deal", "Date": "2015-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Saudi Arabia and its Sunni allies in the Gulf tremble at the prospect of a final nuclear deal with Iran. They fear it will let Iran stir even more trouble than it already is stirring in Yemen, Iraq and Syria. But is that fear misplaced?Yes. President Obama, who has invited these Arab leaders to meet at Camp David this spring, would do well to use the opportunity to assure them of that. He should stress that a final nuclear deal is much likelier to make the Arab world more secure for a decade or more, by preventing Iran from getting near a \u201cbreakout\u201d \u2014 the ability to produce enough bomb-grade material to become a nuclear power. And that would give the whole region time to address the real cause of its instability: the lack of effective pluralist government in fragile states throughout the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa.Fixing that gap requires time to resolve internal political divisions left over from the 20th century. And time to pursue that goal is one likely outcome of the formula reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, last month, particularly if it also promotes Iran\u2019s reintegration with the global economy. That alone has potential to temper Iran\u2019s foreign policy in the region.So far, the Arab countries have operated on a logic precisely opposite. They assume that Iranian interference is the principal cause of their instability, and that Iran is incorrigibly aggressive. Therefore, Iran must be confronted at every turn and rolled back now. Holding open any path toward any nuclear capacity, even far in the future, is too dangerous.For example, Saudi Arabia and its allies blame Iranian machinations for the crisis in Yemen, even though Yemen has suffered ethnic violence for decades. And their worst fear is of the day when the possibility of making a bomb would make Iran invulnerable. So they are using the Yemen conflict to push back against any expansion of Iranian influence.The flaw in that strategy is that it is probably counterproductive. It adds Yemen to a growing list, headed by Syria and Libya, of countries where the Arabs are already committed to difficult proxy wars. Leaving aside the question of how many conflicts can be sustained at one time, the strategy only deepens the region\u2019s sectarian, tribal and ethnic divides. And that further increases Iran\u2019s appetite for nuclear-based clout. With that in mind, getting Iran to slow its progress toward nuclear capability for 10 to 15 years is a far better way to deny it strategic advantages down the road.Let\u2019s face it: The Middle East\u2019s center has imploded. Its crisis is deeply rooted in local instabilities and will continue for some time. Failed states from Libya to Yemen to Syria have set the stage for raging civil wars, extremist insurgencies and sectarian conflicts, all bound to regional rivalries. So long as the pattern is escalating violence rather than political negotiation to establish functional governments, Shiite forces vying for power in the conflicted states will seek Iran\u2019s patronage. And even if Sunni Arab states then support their own friends, Iran will have exploited the collapse of the Arab order to expand its own reach. Saudi leaders\u2019 faith in a military approach to Iran is also linked to their lack of faith that Iran will keep any nuclear deal. But if the Lausanne framework does not produce a final agreement, the United States and its allies will have little choice but to intensify economic sanctions on Iran. And that would sharpen the threat to the Arab states by stiffening Iran\u2019s resolve to hasten its nuclear development and resist monitoring. In other words, the Arab strategy would shorten the time Iran needed for breakout \u2014 not just to a bomb, but to an arsenal. Contrary to some fears, nuclear war would not be the most likely outcome of an Iranian breakout, even if it pushed Saudi Arabia or Egypt to pursue bomb capacity themselves. Israeli and Arab rulers understand that the Middle East is more likely to settle into a \u201cnuclear peace\u201d like the Cold War \u2014 rivalry pursued through asymmetric warfare by or against proxy armies. In that game, Iran already has the advantage of experience and a long reach.Indeed, Iran spends far less on its military than Israel, Turkey or the Persian Gulf Arab monarchies, and a vast technological gap separates its conventional weapons from those of its rivals. But Iran makes up for that with a network of irregular fighters and armed militias trained, financed and managed by its Revolutionary Guards. That is what lets Iran menace Israel on its borders, keep the Assad regime afloat in Syria, help Iraq fight the Islamic State and sustain rebellion in Yemen. And Iran would, indeed, be even freer to do so if it had a nuclear bomb. The logical conclusion, then, is to use whatever time can be mustered now to shore up the economic vitality and political unity of the Arab countries while Iran is seeking readmission to the global economy. In that way, the Middle East countries could reduce drastically Iran\u2019s opportunities to meddle in their internal politics. This is not just theory. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union, despite its huge conventional military, was held at bay in Western Europe not only by American nuclear weapons, but also by the strength of Western Europe\u2019s economy and political systems. The deal that the United States and its partners have outlined with Iran would not eliminate Iran\u2019s nuclear program. But it would allow the rest of the Middle East an opportunity to fortify itself with a new political order. And that goal is what the Arab states, allied with America, must devote themselves to, once a near-term breakout by Iran has been taken off the table in a final nuclear deal.Advertisement"}

Your Salary Is $160,000.", "Date": "2015-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome 39 percent of the largest firms \u2014 those with 700 lawyers or more \u2014 reported paying that amount in the association\u2019s 2015 law associates\u2019 salary survey. This was up from last year, when only 27 percent of the big firms reported paying their new legal hires at the uppermost level.But the percentage was still below 2009, when nearly two-thirds of the first-year salaries were at the top point of $160,000.The reason is not that individual firms are paying less, said James G. Leipold, executive director of National Association for Law Placement, but \u201cas more law firms have grown through acquisition and merger, the largest law firms are not as similar to one another as they used to be.\u201dMr. Leipold added that there were many firms with more than 700 lawyers that have many smaller regional offices, many of which don\u2019t pay the benchmark first-year salary of $160,000. As a result, he added, \u201ca larger percentage of large law firm starting salaries fall below that mark.\u201dThere are certainly exceptions, with some first-year associates making more than the $160,000 figure. But, for the most part, the ceiling seems to have been stuck at that amount since 2007, when some law firms began to increase starting salaries \u2014 a practice that soon began to wane as the economy turned down.\u201cThe simple story is that $160,000 as a starting salary at large law firms is less prevalent than it was immediately prior to the recession,\u201d Mr. Leipold explained. \u201cAt large law firms, starting salaries of $145,000 and $135,000, and even $110,000 are common in some markets, though $160,000 is still the dominant or modal salary in large markets.\u201dIn the biggest legal markets \u2014 including Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington \u2014 $160,000 is the most common salary at the largest firms that reported paying first years. Only about 60 percent of the largest firms with offices in Los Angeles and Washington said they paid the top amount now \u2014 a significant drop from 2009, when 90 percent of firms said they did so.In New York, however, \u201cthe $160,000 starting salary is almost universal,\u201d Mr. Leipold noted. About 85 percent of firms in the city with at least 250 lawyers are paying that amount; about 90 percent of firms with 700 or more lawyers paid first-year hires that amount.The association said 556 law offices from across the country responded to the survey. Over all, the national median first-year salary at firms of any size was $135,000. That is a rise of $10,000 since 2014, but the association said that fewer smaller firms responded this year than in previous years.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Americans Don\u2019t Want to Soak the Rich ", "Date": "2015-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewWith rising income inequality in the United States, you might expect more and more people to conclude that it\u2019s time to soak the rich. Here\u2019s a puzzle, though: Over the last several decades, close to the opposite has happened.Since the 1970s, middle-class incomes have been stagnant in inflation-adjusted terms, while the wealthy have done very well; inequality of wealth and income has risen.Over that same period, though, Americans\u2019 views on whether the government should work to redistribute income \u2014 to tax the rich, for example, and funnel the proceeds to the poor and working class \u2014 have, depending on which survey answers you look at, either been little changed, or shifted toward greater skepticism about redistribution.In other words, Americans\u2019 desire to soak the rich has diminished even as the rich have more wealth available that could, theoretically, be soaked.It\u2019s not just public opinion polls, either. It shows up in the actual policies espoused by candidates for office and enacted by Congress. In 1980, the highest earning Americans faced a 70 percent tax on every dollar they earned beyond $215,400 for a married couple, for example, the equivalent of $544,000 today.Over the last decade, by contrast, the top marginal rate has ranged between 35 percent (which President George W. Bush secured in 2003) and 39.6 percent (which President Obama advocated and which took effect in 2013).This core question \u2014 How much should the government use its power to tax and spend to redistribute wealth in pursuit of a more equal society? \u2014 has been at the root of ideological clashes around the world and throughout history. Yet in American politics in recent years, it has manifested itself in a narrow, partisan debate over whether the top marginal income tax rate should be 35 percent or 39.6 percent.How you make sense of this seeming paradox of rising inequality and flat or declining support for redistribution depends on your ideological assumptions.New research offers a bit more evidence on what may be occurring. It doesn\u2019t disprove either the conventional liberal or conservative argument. But it does show some of the ways that Americans\u2019 attitudes toward redistribution are more complex than either would suggest.In other words, respondents favored less redistribution if they believed that the person had already grown accustomed to a higher income. The psychology seems to be something like this: Rich people who have been rich for a while have gotten used to their money, so it would be unfair to tax them heavily. But people who have just gotten rich have not become accustomed to higher levels of after-tax income, so it wouldn\u2019t be as harmful to raise their taxes in the interest of greater equality.Might this be explained by the elderly becoming more conservative in general, and therefore taking a more conservative view on this issue? Not really. The shift showed up even when the researchers controlled for views on hot-button social issues like abortion and gun control.The researchers offer another way of making sense of the pattern: Older Americans benefit more directly than any other age group from the social safety net, specifically, Social Security and Medicare. The fact that American seniors already receive government-provided health care may make them view any talk of greater redistribution as taking away what they already have, the researchers suggest.The two studies indicate how complex \u2014 even messy \u2014 opinions on this question of political philosophy are. Our views on proper tax levels and redistribution may be shaped by seemingly extraneous factors, like whether we believe the rich are already used to being rich, and whether we are already getting government benefits.In other words, the question isn\u2019t, Why don\u2019t Americans want to soak the rich more? It may be, Who exactly is being counted as rich and who is perceived to be benefiting from the soaking?For other Upshot articles on the subject of inequality:Advertisement"}

But American-brokered peace talks collapsed last year, and instead of agreements, the two sides are engaged in a tense political and diplomatic confrontation.And while the Palestinian Authority leadership is threatening to scale back its security coordination with Israel \u2014 a system of cooperation that is unpopular with many Palestinians \u2014 it has helped maintain the calm, and both sides appear to have an abiding interest in preventing a new outbreak of violence.\u201cThe instructions we get from the government are to maintain security, civilian and economic stability as much as we can,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Nitzan Alon, Israel\u2019s top commander in the West Bank, in a rare interview at the end of his tour as chief of the military\u2019s Central Command.The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and his Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank, have a similarly clear interest in maintaining stability, according to General Alon. He was speaking at military headquarters in Tel Aviv shortly before he was to take up his new post as chief of the military\u2019s operations branch, a senior position in the high command.\u201cWe see it from the instructions their security forces receive and from their activity to prevent terrorism and to prevent encroachment by Islamic Jihad or Hamas,\u201d General Alon said, referring to Islamic militant groups that are the Palestinian Authority\u2019s rivals.But Mr. Abbas said on Sunday that the Palestinian Authority was refusing the money because Israel had deducted funds to pay Palestinian utility debts. The Palestinian Authority, chronically short of cash, has been able to pay its tens of thousands of employees only partial salaries in recent months, and it remained unclear whether the monthly tax transfers would be resumed.In the meantime, General Alon said, Israel has taken some security risks to allow the freer movement of Palestinians in an effort to offset the growing economic hardship, but in a way that bypasses the Palestinian Authority.Israel has relaxed the rules in recent weeks for West Bank Palestinians who seek to enter Israel, allowing men over the age of 55 and women over 50 to cross the checkpoints just by presenting their identity cards. The minimum age for Palestinians applying for work permits in Israel has also been lowered to 22 from 24.Analysts on both sides agree that Palestinian stability is a joint interest, and that Israel finds itself in a paradox.\u201cOn the one hand, there is the developing political confrontation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority,\u201d said Michael Herzog, a former Israeli brigadier general who has participated in most of the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. \u201cOn the other hand, Israel has no interest in the collapse of the Palestinian Authority.\u201d\u201cFor that reason,\u201d he said, \u201cthe tax funds were released, even though the Palestinians did not retract from their approach to the International Criminal Court.\u201dZakaria al-Qaq, a Palestinian expert in national security at Al-Quds University in East Jerusalem, said that ordinary Palestinians, many of them heavily in debt, were now more concerned with making ends meet than with politics and diplomacy.\u201cIt is no longer an issue of national aspirations; it is becoming a matter of survival,\u201d he said.But Professor Qaq said he did not see a new intifada on the horizon after the last two uprisings, in the late 1980s and the early 2000s, failed to end the Israeli occupation and, in the Palestinians\u2019 eyes, left them worse off.\u201cIf and when they go for a third intifada, they will want to know where it is going, what is the destination,\u201d he said.General Alon said the Palestinians were also deterred by the chaos they saw elsewhere in the Middle East, including in Syria and Yemen.Still, he said, the tensions left room for growing unrest. The Israeli military has been preparing for various possibilities, including an increase in armed attacks, mass riots and what General Alon called a \u201cwhite intifada,\u201d meaning a continuation of the Palestinian political and legal campaign abroad coupled with steps meant to undermine Israel\u2019s control in the West Bank.In some West Bank refugee camps, there are the beginnings of a return to the anarchy of the second intifada, he said, with armed men reappearing in the alleyways.Israeli soldiers have killed two Palestinians this year during sporadic clashes in the West Bank. Another Palestinian was fatally shot after he threw a firebomb onto a main road, according to the military, and a fourth was killed while apparently fleeing Israeli police officers who were searching for car thieves.General Alon said that maintaining security coordination was important for Israel, but that for the Palestinian Authority, in its struggle to suppress Hamas, \u201cit is largely essential.\u201dMoreover, he said, Mr. Abbas was well aware that new Palestinian attacks against Israelis would not help his international diplomatic and legal campaign.\u201cWhat is surprising \u2014 or not,\u201d General Alon said, \u201cis that at the same time there is a strategic confrontation, there are also mutual interests for stability on the ground.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It appeared to be the first time in Iran\u2019s revolutionary history that the official news media broadcast the speech of an American president live and in full.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.\u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201d said Mohammad Javad Mehreghan, a financial expert. \u201cSoon we will have direct flights between Tehran and New York.\u201dThere was no immediate reaction from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, or from his office. The ayatollah, who has the final word on the deal, has often stated that he trusts Iran\u2019s negotiators to make decisions, but warned them not to cross \u201cred lines.\u201dMany in Iran have spent the past week following the news, but also expressing doubt that there would ever be a solution. The sanctions have cut deeply into the lives of ordinary people, contributing to an inflation rate that has exceeded 40 percent, slashing buying power and generally casting a blanket of depression over the nation of 70 million.As the idea of a future without sanctions started to sink in, some became emotional.\u201cI was crying with happiness. It is unbelievable,\u201d said Elnaz Karimi, 37, a commercial manager.The company she worked for had lost business, she said, as international financial transactions became prohibitively expensive. \u201cNow we can use this money we would spend on trying to do business on investments,\u201d she said.Analysts and commentators from across the political spectrum welcomed the agreement.Iranian officials called the agreement a \u201cstatement\u201d and a \u201csolution,\u201d in keeping with Mr. Khamenei\u2019s pronouncement that any deal would have to lift all sanctions in one step. The American negotiators had preferred a step-by-step approach, but the Iranians seem to have gotten their way, for the most part.Reviving the economy is now the primary issue for most people. Mr. Rouhani has been leading an effort to bring down inflation, while the end of sanctions might mean a return to oil production of more than two million barrels per day, only half what Iran once produced but twice its output in recent years.\u201cWe need to wait for the final deal to be signed in order to see the positive effects on our economy,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, an analyst close to Ayatollah Khamenei. \u201cBut all in all, this statement is close to what we have been expecting.\u201dNader Karimi Joni, a journalist and former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said European companies would come back and invest. He added, \u201cThe future looks bright.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Washington Governor Puts Focus on Climate Goals, and Less on Debate", "Date": "2015-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut then he paused and said, no, a beautiful blossom was not the point: The deeper reason he is pushing for tough new air-quality policies is to combat worsening health problems, like asthma in children, that are caused by pollution.\u201cIt\u2019s not the flowers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kids\u2019 lungs.\u201dThe line encapsulates Mr. Inslee\u2019s practical approach to advancing one of the most ambitious environmental programs in the country. He has proposed collecting a new charge on emissions from oil refineries, power plants and other industries that would reap an estimated $1.3 billion in the first year. But in contrast to similar systems in California and the Northeast, energy experts said, Mr. Inslee\u2019s plan would use most of the new revenue for education and transportation rather than on climate or energy projects. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to allude to climate change,\u201d Mr. Inslee, a first-term Democrat, said in an interview. \u201cOne can support this simply on the fact that you want to support the education of your children.\u201dThough the fate of the plan is unclear \u2014 the Republicans who control the State Senate have vowed to fight it, and Democrats, a majority in the House, have not pledged an all-out defense \u2014 it underscores how Mr. Inslee operates. He is less interested in winning the debate over climate change than in achieving his goals.\u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate that it came to be seen, by some people at least, through a partisan political lens,\u201d Mr. Inslee said of the climate debate. \u201cBut I do think the ice is breaking.\u201d Critics are not so sure. \u201cGovernor Inslee wants to try to drive this global warming agenda in a state where you can really say we are already leading the way,\u201d said State Senator Doug Ericksen, a Republican and chairman of the chamber\u2019s Energy, Environment and Telecommunications Committee. Adding carbon charges now, he said, would hurt the economy and kill jobs.But to environmentalists \u2014 who have occasionally complained that Mr. Inslee is too cautious \u2014 the carbon plan is groundbreaking, making him a national leader of what they say is a quiet movement to find practical solutions to daunting environmental problems without regard to politics.Shooting for results, even if sometimes incremental, was a hallmark of Mr. Inslee\u2019s 15 years in Congress. He favored greater wilderness protections on federal land, but when that was not politically feasible, he shifted to the middle ground, defending rules that discouraged development of roads in forests and on other lands. Those rules were ultimately left intact by the Supreme Court in a 2012 ruling.In a debate over water quality as governor, he supported what he called a balanced plan \u2014 tightening some pollution rules while leaving others alone.\u201cJay has always had a clear eye on the bull\u2019s-eye, the goal he\u2019s trying to achieve, and also an understanding of what he has to do to get there,\u201d said Bill Arthur, who has watched Mr. Inslee for 30 years at the Sierra Club, where he is the deputy Western campaign director for the Beyond Coal campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s smart and savvy enough to know, \u2018I\u2019ve also got to speak in a language and speak in terms that can resonate with a larger contingent of people.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Inslee, 64, a fifth-generation Washingtonian who grew up in the Seattle area, said he owed part of his appreciation of the natural world to his father, Frank. Frank Inslee, a high school science teacher, often led the family on volunteer expeditions to replant alpine meadows on the slopes of Mount Rainier, the glacier-clad volcano south of Seattle.But money for education, a key to Mr. Inslee\u2019s carbon plan, was also the starting place for his political career in the 1980s, when he was working as a lawyer in a small town in central Washington that needed to build a new high school. The fight over the school\u2019s funding led him to run for his first public office, in the legislature. He jokes that now, in trying to link emissions to education, he is back where he started.His plan is also a kind of throwback, environmental researchers said, to familiar \u2014 and politically popular \u2014 taxes long applied to alcohol or tobacco.\u201cWe\u2019re starting as a society to see carbon emissions as a bad, and by framing it the way he has, he brings it into the sin-tax way of seeing things,\u201d said Mark Stephan, an associate professor of political science at Washington State University who studies environmental politics. \u201cInslee is packaging the policy in a way that makes it more politically palatable.\u201dIn March, the Senate passed a transportation-funding bill of its own, with a phased-in, 11-cent-per-gallon increase in the gasoline tax. The House passed its own plan \u2014 different from the Senate\u2019s vision but similar in leaving out any mention of Mr. Inslee\u2019s carbon proposal as a funding mechanism.A spokesman for the governor, David Postman, said that the means to pay for the Legislature\u2019s commitments had not been determined, and that Mr. Inslee would continue to promote the carbon bill as an answer. \u201cThere are apparently a handful of members who need to be convinced, and the governor will certainly be talking with those folks,\u201d Mr. Postman said in an email.Under Mr. Inslee\u2019s program, the state would set an overall cap on carbon emissions and require the state\u2019s biggest polluters to pay for each metric ton of pollution emitted. The price would be set at an auction, and buyers of emission allowances could sell the amounts they did not need.The governor\u2019s allies on environmental issues are already talking about taking his ideas directly to voters in a referendum, perhaps in 2016, if the Legislature does not pass them. Mr. Inslee, in the interview, declined to say what his next steps might be \u2014 or his strategy in the final weeks of the legislative session, which ends in late April. He said only that he remained deeply optimistic.As a case in point, he cited a recent discussion in Seattle with several dozen college students from schools around the state. The group was chatting about everything from tuition to the arts, when Mr. Inslee lobbed a question from left field: How many of them believed that humans were significantly contributing to global climate change?Everyone raised a hand.\u201cUnanimity is pretty amazing,\u201d he said, shaking his head.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Long Live Europe", "Date": "2015-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 There\u2019s an American cottage industry specialized in Europe\u2019s woes: a feckless Continent whose defense spending is never adequate; a monetary union that is irretrievably flawed; a land of welfare that breeds unemployment; a place of resurgent hatreds that led Ronald Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, to observe this year that Europe \u201clooks more like 1933 than 2015.\u201dNope, Europe looks more like 2015, a borderless market of more than half a billion people between whom war has become impossible, so attractive to much of humankind that thousands die trying to get into it, a Continent where entitlements including universal health care are seen not as socialist indulgence but basic humanity, and a magnet to states outside the European Union that long to be part of this security-conferring entity.Entities are unsexy. They do not send a shiver down the spine or cause a telltale tremor. But the entity without precedent that is the 28-member Union has delivered. It has delivered peace above all, prosperity however frayed, and freedom to former inmates of the Soviet imperium. It has also created an awareness of European identity that falls short of European patriotism but is nonetheless a counterweight to the primal nationalism that stained the Continent with so much blood.As Dominique Mo\u00efsi, a French political scientist, observed to me recently: \u201cEurope is alive. It is not well, but it is alive.\u201d A falling euro and cheap oil have even prompted economic stirrings. European automakers had their best performance in a year last month. Growth estimates for the eurozone economy this year are being revised upward.It is dangerous to succumb to undiluted Europe-bashing. It\u2019s a form of amnesia. It\u2019s also an invitation to those who seek to break Europe\u2019s integration, chief among them Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. The Russian president sees the weak link in Europe\u2019s chain in Greece, now governed by the left-wing Syriza party of Alexis Tsipras, whose dalliance with Moscow is worrying. Brussels is synonymous in Athens with German-imposed austerity. Gazprom is synonymous with blandishments, including up-front cash. The temptation to offset anti-European anger with Russia-coddling exists, even if it\u2019s a dangerous blind alley. Greece does not belong with Belorussia or with Putin\u2019s \u201canti-fascist\u201d fascism-lite.Of course, Putin was not the cause of Greece\u2019s woes; he merely seeks to exploit them. Those woes, traceable to the misguided decision to include Greece in the euro at its outset for reasons of civilizational mawkishness, are not about to abate \u2014 and here we get to the reasons why 2015 is a critical year for Europe. Despite a brutal fiscal adjustment, the fact remains that Greece\u2019s debt is not repayable. In fact it is probably even less repayable now than at the outset of the crisis. Syriza\u2019s electoral victory was a reflection of the sentiment that something has to give.At some point there must be debt forgiveness; the cost of stupid loans has to be recognized. Or there may be a Greek default. The worst outcome for Europe would be a Greek exit from the euro. Joining the shared currency, for all the nations in it, was an \u201cirrevocable\u201d decision. Once one country goes, the whole edifice wobbles. Markets are not sentimental about probing weakness. The constant question will be, \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201dAt the other end of Europe lies another danger, within another tenuous union, Great Britain. An election will be held May 7. It will be held as Britain shows signs of turning into Israel \u2014 that is a state where elections are merely the prelude to the real political business of trying to form a coalition government. A hung Parliament looks plausible. The big parties are weaker. Splintering is the name of the game.Whether David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives or Ed Miliband\u2019s Labour will be the biggest party is unclear. But neither seems likely to be able to govern alone. Even short of formal alliances, Cameron may have to lean on the anti-immigrant, anti-European rant merchants of the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP), and Miliband may need support from the Scottish Nationalist Party, which wants to break up Britain.Cameron, prodded by nationalist tides, has promised, if re-elected, a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union in 2017. His victory would therefore lock in a two-year period of deep uncertainty over the future direction of a major European state. Miliband has rejected a referendum \u2014 an eminent piece of good sense \u2014 but even if the attempts by his opponents to paint him as some Syriza clone in Britain are nonsense, he will have to reassure the City and (presumably) assuage Scottish nationalists, a tough balancing act.Europe is alive. It is not the corpse of certain American doom-merchants. It needs Greece and Britain. It does not need a Putin putsch. Above all it needs the capacity to see its crisis in historical context, because unity to Europe must be as sacred as liberty to the United States. Advertisement"}

The much-anticipated handshake on Friday night came as leaders gathered for a welcome dinner, where Mr. Obama and Mr. Castro were seated at the same table, separated by two other people.Before the official start of the summit meeting, Mr. Obama spoke at a civil society forum. \u201cAs we move toward the process of normalization, we\u2019ll have our differences government-to-government with Cuba on many issues, just as we differ at times with other nations within the Americas,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but I\u2019m here to say that when we do speak out, we\u2019re going to do so because the United States of America does believe, and will always stand for, a certain set of universal values.\u201dMr. Obama made it clear that he still had human rights concerns and was determined to discuss them openly. He held a lengthy meeting with civil society leaders from 12 other countries, including two from Cuba, after a speech at the forum in which he referred to the American civil rights and gay rights movements and to people who opposed apartheid in South Africa and Communism in the Soviet Union.\u201cCivil society is the conscience of our countries,\u201d he said. Cuba is attending the Summit of the Americas for the first time since the meeting\u2019s inception in 1994. As senior Cuban and American officials spoke, people representing pro- and anti-Cuban government groups clashed for the third straight day on the sidelines, drawing a contrast with the diplomatic warming.Hours before Mr. Obama arrived to address the civil society forum at a hotel here, members of groups sent by the Cuban government tried to block access to dissidents, calling them mercenaries who did not speak for Cuba.At one point, amid angry chanting by the various groups, one of Cuba\u2019s best-known government opponents, Guillermo Farinas, was jostled and manhandled as he tried to pass through a crowd of pro-Castro demonstrators.\u201cThese aren\u2019t really dissidents, they aren\u2019t really interested in democracy and human rights,\u201d Patricia Flechilla, a Cuban student and delegate at the summit meeting, told reporters, going on to repeat a familiar complaint from the Cuban government that opponents are paid and propped up by foreign governments, namely the United States.The fracas interrupted the work of the forum, made up of nongovernmental groups from across the hemisphere, to produce a statement directed at the region\u2019s leaders. Later, before Mr. Obama arrived, scores of people waving Cuban flags and chanting \u201cLong Live Fidel, Long Live Ra\u00fal\u201d gathered outside the hotel.Representatives of the Cuban delegation said they would withdraw from the civil society forum rather than \u201cshare space with mercenaries.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uncertainty Over Impact of a Default by Greece", "Date": "2015-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen it comes to assessing the consequences of a messy Greek default on global markets, two views have vied for supremacy in the minds of investors.Now, with Greece nearly out of cash and talks with the country\u2019s creditors at an impasse, regulators, investors and economists are coming around to a view that after five years of endless analysis and speculation, no one really knows how the markets will react.And that may be the scariest thought of all.\u201cThere is just no playbook for this,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at the Deltec International Group, a Bahamas-based investment company. \u201cThat is what concerns me.\u201dNothing vexes a professional investor more than uncertainty, that creeping belief that after all the number-crunching and analyzing, one is still unable to predict anything resembling a likely outcome.And that is where many investors find themselves at this moment as they struggle to interpret the mix of bureaucratic machinations and inscrutable politics that have come to define Europe\u2019s relationship with Greece.On Monday, the Greek stock market rallied and bond yields dipped in the face of speculation that Greece\u2019s controversial finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, would assume a reduced role in future talks with Greece\u2019s creditors.During talks last week in Riga, Latvia, eurozone officials complained that Mr. Varoufakis was obstructing progress on a debt deal by not providing details on the economic reforms that Europe is demanding from Greece before releasing another round of loans.They have bonded over endless phone calls before Mr. Tsipras\u2019s party won the election earlier this year. While Mr. Varoufakis was on a teaching break at the University of Texas in 2013, Mr. Tsipras came to Austin for a visit, and the two men and their wives drank beer and danced to country music in the city\u2019s honky-tonk bars.Over the weekend, Mr. Tsipras reaffirmed his support for his embattled finance minister in a phone call and email exchange with Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who represents European creditors and who has clashed on several occasions with Mr. Varoufakis.In a brief interview on Monday, Mr. Varoufakis said that while a new team was being formed in relation to creditor talks, he will oversee it and continue to represent Greece in these negotiations.\u201cI am not going anywhere,\u201d Mr. Varoufakis said.In addition to pushing for Mr. Varoufakis\u2019s ouster, Mr. Dijsselbloem asked that creditor missions be allowed to resume their work in Greek government ministries.To both these requests, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s response was no, Mr. Varoufakis said.Unlike the market talk during the earlier crisis in 2011 and 2012, the debate among investors now is not focused on which banks and funds will suffer from their Greek investments, as these exposures have been sharply pared back.Instead, the current market worry is both more diffuse and less clear.Yet for many bankers and regulators \u2014 many of whom still bear the scars of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 \u2014 it is precisely this mix of complacency and uncertainty that worries them.\u201cThe bottom line is that no one really knows what will happen if Greece does not pay,\u201d said Hans Humes, who runs Greylock Capital, a hedge fund that specializes in distressed bonds.It is not for a want of trying.Over the last year, investors have taken some unusual steps to gain just the slightest information edge when it comes to grasping these complexities.One investor commissioned a psychiatrist to assess the mental health of Mr. Varoufakis via video clips, to try to better understand the opinionated academic\u2019s brazen negotiating tactics.And one banker, seeking some historical perspective, has been scouring Byzantine history books for fresh insights.There have been few answers so far, however.\u201cWe just don\u2019t know,\u201d said one frustrated hedge fund investor after a weekend spent scrutinizing the websites of Greek newspapers for a clue.One thing is for certain, though: As long as the debt talks stumble on without agreement, the greater the likelihood is that Greece either misses a debt payment (it owes 763 million euros, or about $830 million, to the International Monetary Fund on May 12) or submits to capital controls to stem a fatal bank run.Greek finance officials have been looking into the possibility of Greece issuing i.o.u.s, or scrip payments, as a way to save scarce euros.Mr. Varoufakis has long argued that a Greek default and exit from the euro would be seismic and carry a broad cost to Europe of over \u20ac1 trillion.Eric Dor, an expert on eurozone capital flows at the I\u00e9seg School of Management in France, says in a paper that while private sector investors hold fewer Greek bonds these days, the exposure of the European taxpayer to Greek debt has skyrocketed to \u20ac318 billion.By refusing to pay Greece the \u20ac7.2 billion from the last bailout because of disagreements over economic reforms, Europe is now courting a default on this much larger sum.Senior members of the United States government, in perhaps their only area of agreement with Mr. Varoufakis, also worry that Europe may be underplaying the consequences of a Greek default.\u201cWe view this as serious,\u201d said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cThis is a world of unknown unknowns.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Weighing the British Political Opponents", "Date": "2015-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyAre the Tories and Labour the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of British politics? There is not much to choose between the British parties in economic election pledges. Both want to cut the deficit gradually, both want to splash out on the National Health Service, and both have a smattering of silly policies. The big differences are that Labour would tax the rich more and the Tories might take Britain out of the European Union.Given how much Labour has criticized the Conservative-led coalition government for budgetary austerity and how the Tories have in turn lambasted the opposition for fiscal irresponsibility, one might have expected them to be setting forth radically different views about how to manage the deficit, which is still 5 percent of gross domestic product.In fact, they both have sensible measured approaches to reducing the deficit. This is partly because the Tories have eased up a bit on their planned cuts, while Labour has sought to dress itself up as fiscally responsible.True, David Cameron, the Tory leader, would reduce the deficit a bit faster. But he has also come up with a large, off-balance-sheet spending plan \u2014 giving the tenants of housing associations the right to buy their homes at a discount. The government would compensate the housing associations for the discount, but this cost would be viewed as a capital outlay and thus not count toward the deficit.Not only do the two parties have broadly the same view about the deficit; they share similar spending priorities. The Tories have sought to banish fears that they are not good stewards of Britain\u2019s much-loved National Health Service by promising an extra eight billion British pounds, or about $12 billion, a year for health care. They have also outbid Labour in their pledge to double free child care for parents with toddlers to 30 hours a week. The opposition is promising an increase to 25 hours a week.One might have expected the Conservatives to be better on microeconomic policy. After all, Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, has a penchant for meddling in the market. He has promised, for example, to freeze energy prices and rail fares as well as to jack up the minimum wage and ban so-called zero-hour contracts, an extremely flexible type of employment deal that gives workers no guarantee of work.But Mr. Cameron has caught the meddling bug too. He has effectively matched Mr. Miliband\u2019s pledge to freeze rail fares and increase the minimum wage. Meanwhile, he would force large companies to give workers an extra three days off each year to do charitable work \u2014 something that would add to businesses\u2019 costs.One clear difference between the parties is on taxing the rich. Labour wants to increase the top rate of income tax, for those earning over \u00a3150,000 a year, from 45 percent to 50 percent. It also wants to scrap the so-called non-dom status, which allows some wealthy people to avoid paying tax on their foreign incomes. Although it is fair to tighten up on this privilege, the way Labour is proposing to do so could drive some people who contribute to the economy offshore.Finally, Mr. Miliband plans to introduce a so-called Mansion Tax on homes worth more than \u00a32 million. Although housing is undertaxed in Britain, Labour\u2019s proposal falls well short of a good idea. It would load taxes on a few people, mainly in London, but would do nothing to iron out anomalies lower down the property ladder. Far better to charge a flat percentage on all homes.Mind you, Mr. Cameron has come up with his own dubious housing policy: a plan to let couples leave homes worth up to \u00a31 million to their children or grandchildren without any inheritance tax. It may be a good idea to cut death taxes, but doing so only for homes would give the British people yet another reason to invest in property, rather than more productive assets.Another big difference is that the Tories have promised to renegotiate Britain\u2019s relationship with the European Union and then give the people a vote on whether to stay in. This is potentially extremely worrying, since quitting the European Union would be bad for the economy. That said, Mr. Cameron has not yet made any impossible demands on his European Union partners \u2014 with the possible exception of wanting to deny migrants access to benefits for their first four years in the country. He would almost certainly campaign to stay in himself.Meanwhile, if Labour won the election, the Europe issue would not go away. If the Tories are re-elected, they will bring back their referendum pledge \u2014 and, in such a future scenario, they might be led by somebody more euroskeptical than Mr.Cameron.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Laurent Fabius: Our Climate Imperatives", "Date": "2015-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPARIS \u2014 Toward the end of this year, France will host the 21st United Nations climate conference. The aim? To reach a universal agreement that will limit the rise in average global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius, compared to the pre-industrial period, by the end of the century. There is real hope for success, but it is an enormous task. As the president of the conference, known as COP21, my role will be to facilitate an ambitious compromise between 195 states (196 parties when we include the European Union). In the negotiations, the differences among countries that are at distinct stages of development necessitate differences of approach. Yet strong common interests unite us. One example is the impact of climate change on our shared security.The climate has always posed threats to security. Climate disruption upsets the full range of economic and social equilibrium \u2014 and it therefore threatens countries\u2019 internal security.In France, for example, historians have shown that disastrous weather in 1788 caused the food crisis that contributed to the outbreak of the French Revolution. More recently, in 2005, Hurricane Katrina wreaked havoc that led to disturbances in civil order and the deployment of the army on American soil. Beyond borders, climate change can stoke international conflict over the control of vital and increasingly scarce resources \u2014 particularly water. Examples of this include the tensions among Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over the Nile and its tributaries, between Israel and its neighbors over the Jordan River basin, and among Turkey, Syria and Iraq over the Euphrates. Another source of insecurity is the massive displacement of people. By making certain areas uninhabitable, droughts and rising water levels uproot entire populations. They often find refuge in regions that are already overpopulated, creating or exacerbating tensions among countries or groups. When uprooted, such populations can fall prey to radical movements. This is what happened in the Sahel in the late 1970s, when extreme droughts contributed to the exodus of many Tuaregs toward Libya, many of whom then enrolled in Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi\u2019s Islamic Legion. A trace of this was found in the destabilization of northern Mali that led to France\u2019s military intervention in 2013.Threats to peace and security will increase in both number and intensity if the rise in temperatures exceeds 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) \u2014 and this rise will happen if we fail to act or take insufficient action. A climate-disrupted planet would be an unstable one.There is nothing abstract about these risks. In Egypt, an increase of 50 centimeters, or almost 20 inches, in the sea level would cause millions of people to flee the Nile Delta, with security consequences for the entire region. Increased desertification of unstable areas, such as the Sahel, would foster the growth of criminal networks and armed terrorist groups, which are already thriving there. Similarly, climate disruption would exacerbate the threats that are currently concentrated in regions from Niger to the Persian Gulf. This \u201carc of crisis\u201d is also an \u201carc of drought.\u201d These facts should lead us to two conclusions. First, it is essential to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius. Second, we need to reduce the exposure of people to the damage caused by climate disruption \u2014 in particular, by protecting coastlines from rising water levels and by organizing more effective management of water in dry areas. In the language of international negotiations, this is called adaptation, a topic that has not always received the attention it deserves. Adaptation must be a central focus of the agreement that is to be reached at the end of 2015.The massive use of fossil fuels \u2014 coal, oil, gas \u2014 has accelerated conflicts ever since they have been central to our economies. Fossil fuel deposits are very unevenly distributed, leading to dependency, jealousy and often violent competition. It should not be forgotten that control of coal resources on both sides of the Rhine was a core issue in the conflicts between France and Germany. It is thanks to the European Coal and Steel Community and to the reduced dependence on coal that these rivalries have disappeared. Today, at the very gates of Europe, control of natural gas supply routes is also at the center of conflicts that threaten to destabilize our Continent, as demonstrated by the \u201cgas war\u201d between Russia and Ukraine in 2009. In Asia, exploitation of the hydrocarbon-rich seabed and the securing of supply routes for these resources contribute much to the tensions between China and Japan.We need a \u201cglobal clean energy community\u201d to free us from dependence on fossil fuels and the related risks of conflict. Reducing carbon intensity improves security \u2014 energy security and security in general \u2014 as it equalizes access to energy. A country that develops its own solar- or wind-energy production takes nothing from anyone: The light and wind that it uses are not only renewable; they belong to all. We should not underestimate the major contribution this could make to peace and security. It follows that it is essential for COP21 to provide \u2014 first and foremost to developing countries \u2014 the practical means to increase access to energy, while reducing the carbon intensity of economies. This would decrease considerably the risk of fossil fuels becoming a cause of conflict in the coming decades.Helping countries reduce their exposure to climate damage, and democratizing energy access while reducing carbon intensity are two imperatives for our fundamental security needs. Aligning all of our interests around them should allow us to reach a universal agreement. If we want to achieve this objective \u2014 and doing so is essential for humanity \u2014 we will need everyone to contribute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Economy Grew at 0.2% Rate in First Quarter", "Date": "2015-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepeating an all-too-familiar pattern, the American economy slowed to a crawl in the first quarter of 2015, weighed down by a weaker trade performance, falling business investment and still-cautious consumers.At 0.2 percent, the annualized growth rate last quarter was better than the winter wipeout in the first quarter of 2014, when the economy contracted at a 2.1 percent rate. But the figures released on Wednesday by the Commerce Department confirm other signals in recent weeks that the economy, which was hit again by harsh weather in large portions of the nation, began 2015 by treading at water at best.\u201cThe U.S. economy stumbled badly in the first quarter,\u201d said Scott Anderson, senior vice president and chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. \u201cModest growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 turned into virtually no growth in the first quarter of 2015.\u201dThe anemic showing was led by two areas that were especially weak: net exports and business investment.Hurt by the stronger dollar and the lingering effects of a labor dispute that slowed activity at West Coast ports, net exports fell 7.2 percent in the first quarter, which shaved nearly a full point off the overall growth figure.Plunging investment by businesses also weighed on the American economy, a trend some experts attribute to big cuts in spending in the energy sector, as falling oil prices prompted drillers and oil production companies to pull back on new projects.Still, even with the disappointing start to the year, most experts expect growth to rebound later in 2015, much as it did last year.\u201cWe believe weakness was grossly exaggerated, and there will be significant catch-up in Q2, but, of course, that remains to be seen,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.One part of the economy that had been expected to help, the public sector, actually hurt overall growth last quarter. State and local government expenditures fell at the steepest rate since the first quarter of 2012.That the economy expanded at all last quarter was mostly because of outlays by consumers, although they spent at a significantly slower rate than in the second half of last year.Consumer spending, which makes up roughly two-thirds of gross domestic product, rose 1.9 percent. That was well below the 4.4 percent gain in the fourth quarter of 2014, and was a sign that shoppers remained cautious, despite the big drop in energy prices.This is the first of three estimates of economic growth the Commerce Department will release, and the number could be revised sharply upward or downward. The next estimate will come out on May 29.Like Mr. O\u2019Sullivan, Mr. Anderson said he was looking for growth to pick up in the current quarter, predicting a gain of slightly more than 2 percent for the spring, with the rate of expansion rising to just under 3 percent in the second half of 2015. \u201cWe\u2019re not throwing in the towel for 2015,\u201d he said.He said that he expected consumers, with more money in their bank accounts from lower oil prices and an improving job market, to spend more aggressively later in the year.Retail activity has been surprisingly weak recently given the drop in gasoline prices since last summer, he said. Consumers are most likely using the windfall to pay down credit card debt or add to savings. If spending does pick up, so will overall economic growth.Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS, also expects a rebound in economic activity this year, but he cautioned that some of the headwinds evident last quarter would not immediately abate.The drop in energy-related spending will eventually level out, he said, but it will take some time. Similarly, even though the port problems in California and elsewhere have been resolved, the dollar remains strong compared with currencies like the euro, and no relief for exporters is in sight.\u201cThe dollar has strengthened so much that it could restrain the magnitude of the rebound,\u201d Mr. Berger said.Wednesday was a busy day for economists, traders and bankers. In a separate report later in the morning, the National Association of Realtors said pending home sales in March rose 1.1 percent.Pending sales are now at their highest level since June 2013, according to the Realtors\u2019 index, and some experts say the housing market should remain strong in the next few months, especially since the Federal Reserve does not seem to be in a rush to raise short-term interest rates.About 2 p.m., the Fed\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee will issue a statement after the conclusion of a two-day meeting.Fed policy makers are expected to remain cautious about when they will begin raising short-term interest rates from near zero.After earlier predictions that the Fed might move as early as June, most economists now say the Fed will wait at least until their September meeting, or even later.The latest data \u201cstrengthens the argument for a delay by the Fed,\u201d Mr. Anderson said.He continued: \u201cI think September is still likely for the first rate increase, but we need to see better economic data for several months before the Fed becomes confident enough to pull the trigger.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazilian Soccer\u2019s Financial Disarray Starts to Show on the Field", "Date": "2015-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrazil\u2019s professional teams are drowning in debt, hemorrhaging players and playing in near-empty stadiums. Eight of the top 12 clubs are behind on salaries; if they were businesses, nearly every team in the first division, Serie A, would be bankrupt.Now, with Brazil\u2019s economy in recession, and sponsors and fans cutting back on spending, the clubs\u2019 finances are expected to get even worse. The clubs must publish their 2014 results by April 30, and only one \u2014 Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Flamengo \u2014 will be able to announce that it has earned enough to service its debt and pay its taxes, according to estimations by Cesar Grafietti, a credit manager at the Brazilian investment bank Ita\u00fa BBA.The consequences are increasingly visible on the field.Brazil\u2019s clubs make much of their money by selling their players \u2014 almost none of whom are free agents \u2014 to foreign clubs, but the export of Brazilian soccer talent is accelerating. And instead of sending stars like Neymar to top European clubs like Barcelona for tens of millions of dollars, Brazilian clubs are selling their best players to teams in countries out of the global soccer spotlight.Cruzeiro, a club from Belo Horizonte that was the league champion in 2013 and 2014, this year sold two top young players, \u00c9verton Ribeiro and Ricardo Goulart, to teams in the United Arab Emirates and China. Ribeiro and Goulart are considered to be strong candidates to play on Brazil\u2019s national team in the 2018 World Cup, though playing in second-tier leagues may hurt their chances.Teams desperate for cash are selling ever-younger players, even teenagers who have not yet established themselves and can command only modest transfer fees.\u201cThe clubs are selling their futures,\u201d said Amir Somoggi, a sports management consultant in S\u00e3o Paulo. Somoggi estimated that Brazilian clubs would sell more than 1,200 players to foreign teams this year.\u201cFans used to be able to see top talents play for at least a few years here before they got sent abroad,\u201d Grafietti said. \u201cNow the best players are going immediately, and the quality of the spectacle is suffering.\u201dThe clubs\u2019 troubles are rooted in years of reckless management. All of the first-division clubs are structured as nonprofit organizations that in theory exist to serve their fans. Qualified fans \u2014 usually those who pay a modest membership fee \u2014 vote to choose the clubs\u2019 top management, which does not receive salaries. Fans usually do not elect those who promise long-term success, but those who promise a championship immediately, no matter the cost.S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Corinthians, for example, in 2013 paid a 15 million euro transfer fee (about $16.1 million) to bring striker Alexandre Pato back from the Italian club A.C. Milan. Corinthians kept Pato for only a year before sending him on loan to its city rival S\u00e3o Paulo F.C.To stay afloat, many clubs are resorting to bank loans at interest rates that often exceed 30 percent a year, and to blatant tax evasion.As nonprofits, the clubs do not pay corporate income tax, but they withhold income tax from their players\u2019 salaries and are supposed to pay social security contributions. Many do not, however, and spend the money deducted from players\u2019 paychecks instead.As a result, the government has become the clubs\u2019 biggest creditor, with about four billion reais ($1.3 billion) in unpaid taxes.Three times in the past 15 years, the government has given the clubs similar refinancing deals. This time will be different, government officials say, because the proposed legislation demands that the clubs put their houses in order.The proposed bill would forbid clubs from spending more than 70 percent of revenue on salaries, require them to pay all taxes and salaries on time, and demand that they break even financially no later than 2021. The bill would also require the clubs to invest in player development and women\u2019s soccer.Somoggi estimated that, for the clubs to meet these requirements, they would have to cut spending on salaries by 30 percent on average.To enforce the new requirements, the legislation would make management personally liable for missteps and would relegate noncompliant clubs out of the first division.The response of many clubs to the proposed changes has been outrage.\u201cThe bill creates penal aspects that are entirely inappropriate,\u201d said L\u00e1zaro Cunha, director of legal affairs for the Belo Horizonte club Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro. \u201cIf it passes, there will be a rebellion among the clubs.\u201dCunha said he agreed that \u201cthe clubs must improve management and fiscal responsibility,\u201d but that the new bill was \u201cuncalled-for and unprecedented government interference in the business of private entities.\u201dAtl\u00e9tico Mineiro and other clubs are working to persuade congress to change the bill, but Eduardo Bandeira de Mello, the president of Flamengo, Brazil\u2019s most popular club, said he supported it.\u201cIt is severe but necessary,\u201d he said.De Mello, a longtime executive in Brazil\u2019s national development bank before he took the reins of Flamengo in 2013, spent his first years at the club cutting costs to balance the books.\u201cWe sent V\u00e1gner Love, our best player, abroad and we made no big hires for two years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hurt our performance.\u201dWith his club\u2019s finances now relatively solid, de Mello said he was eager for the bill to pass so other teams would have to play by the same rules.Whether the current bill survives the lobbying effort against it, few dispute that Brazilian soccer must change. The national team\u2019s humiliating defeat to Germany in last year\u2019s World Cup semifinals, a national embarrassment that highlighted the weakened state of the country\u2019s domestic game, convinced many Brazilians that their league needed major structural reform.\u201cThat 7-1 loss was a wake-up call,\u201d said Juca Kfouri, a leading Brazilian soccer journalist. \u201cThere\u2019s support among players and in society for change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airplane Seat Swapping Turns Rough-and-Tumble", "Date": "2015-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesJ. L. Pomeroy has flown long enough to know that there are limits to how obliging she will be to her fellow passengers, especially those who want her seat.\u201cI always pretty much just say no,\u201d she said. She rarely gives her decision a second thought.\u201cI always pick a very specific seat for very specific reasons, and somebody\u2019s fleeting whim at the last minute isn\u2019t something I want to accommodate on a long flight,\u201d said Ms. Pomeroy, who runs a film and event production company.For passengers in increasingly stratified plane cabins, the scramble for the right seat has become more intense than ever.Just asking to switch remains a popular choice, but increasingly, frequent travelers say that fellow passengers are breaching long-established etiquette and simply plopping down in a seat of their choice.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of they don\u2019t understand the value,\u201d said Joanna Bloor, a consultant. \u201cIt is truly lack of an awareness that this is a transaction.\u201dTim Nickerson has learned just how aggressive the commandeering of seats can be. When he boarded a small commuter jet, he saw a woman in his spot \u2014 a window seat with no aisle seat next to it. \u201cI just tell her that I think she\u2019s in my seat, and she basically says, \u2018Yup,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Nickerson recalled. \u201cShe wanted to be on the single-seat side and so did I, obviously.\u201dMr. Nickerson held firm, but as it turned out, the flight crew needed to shuffle around passengers to balance the weight distribution, and he found himself seated next to the woman, who seemed determined to make her displeasure known.When an elbow first landed in his ribs, Mr. Nickerson figured his seatmate was still adjusting. But by the third \u2014 or maybe the fourth \u2014 jab, he had a hunch that the woman next to him was sending him a message.\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a 60-minute flight. There\u2019s no reason,\u201d he said. \u201cI think she was looking for another fight but didn\u2019t want to be the instigator.\u201dTurf wars over the limited real estate in a plane cabin, from the overhead bins to the armrests, have become more acute in recent years. And with airlines packing planes tighter and charging more for exit rows, for seats further up in the economy cabin or for seat selection at the time of booking, requests \u2014 or demands \u2014 to swap seats have taken on a new tenor.\u201cPeople know not all seats in the cabin are created equally,\u201d said John Thomas, head of the global aviation practice for L.E.K. Consulting.Carriers increasingly divide the cabin into smaller segments, more like the way seating in a theater or a sporting arena is priced. Industry experts say this gives customers what they want.\u201cAirlines are beginning to realize, \u2018Wait a minute, we can attach a monetary value to things, and why shouldn\u2019t we?\u2019 That\u2019s what we\u2019re in the world of now,\u201d said Jay Sorensen, president of IdeaWorksCompany, an airline consulting firm.For the airlines, the greater stratification has brought more order to the cabin.\u201cYes, the airline will make money out of it, but it\u2019s actually giving the customers greater control over their experience,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cOur research shows that travel is stressful for most people, and the more ambiguity you can take out of the experience the better.\u201dExactly how much money is hard to estimate \u2014 airlines don\u2019t generally break those numbers out \u2014 but there are indications it could be a significant amount. Mr. Thomas estimated that ancillary revenue from selling premium economy seats brings domestic airlines around $1.3 billion annually.As a result, travelers who don\u2019t want to pay extra for a preferred seat might need to ask a fellow passenger to swap. But frequent travelers say that there is a definite etiquette to this activity that infrequent travelers often violate.A request is more likely to be granted if the person who wants to swap is willing to move further back in the cabin, or take a middle seat. Even so, asking is no guarantee.Ms. Pomeroy said she frequently saw fellow passengers helping themselves to seats a class above their assigned seat. \u201cIt\u2019s really unfair to the person who\u2019s in the seat who paid for it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a difference in fare.\u201dFrequent travelers agree that flying provokes more anxiety today, although some say the increasing stratification aggravates the situation.\u201cIt\u2019s a capacity thing,\u201d Ms. Bloor said. \u201cI have seen increased crankiness on this particular issue because of more tighter-packed planes.\u201dOthers try to get a jump on reserving a preferred seat. When Darlene Marshall was flying home to Montreal last year, she got up early and drove to the local library, the closest place where she could access free Wi-Fi, to check in exactly 24 hours before her flight was scheduled to depart.\u201cI find if you don\u2019t web-check early, the good seats are gone,\u201d Ms. Marshall said. \u201cThere\u2019s a shrinking and shrinking portion of seats that are for the taking on web check.\u201dFor her trouble, Ms. Marshall said, she still had competition from her seatmate when she got on board and tried to take the seat she had booked.\u201cShe was kind of really getting snippy,\u201d she said. The other passenger claimed she needed to sleep and couldn\u2019t do so in an aisle seat. \u201cIt was kind of embarrassing to do it in front of everybody.\u201dThe woman raised enough of a fuss that Ms. Marshall eventually relented, just as a flight attendant emerged and told the woman they had found another window seat for her.\u201cShe said, \u2018No \u2014 I\u2019m going to write a letter to the airline,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Marshall recalled. \u201cAll I can think is, \u2018Oh my gosh, I\u2019m sitting next to a big baby.\u2019 \u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on the Itineraries page on April 14 about aircraft seat-swapping misstated the given name of a passenger who was elbowed repeatedly by a fellow passenger who wanted his window seat. He is Tim Nickerson, not Tom.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Republican Attacks on the Fed, Experts See a Shift", "Date": "2015-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring previous periods of high unemployment, members of Congress pressed the Fed to print more money even as the Fed remained wary of the inflationary consequences of such efforts.After the Great Recession, by contrast, the loudest criticism has come from politicians demanding that the Fed shut down its printing press and raise interest rates.Republicans like Mr. Garrett argue the central bank needs to be reined in because they say it has abandoned caution in its continuing effort to stimulate faster economic growth. They say the Fed was granted considerable autonomy so it could keep inflation under control, and it is now abusing that independence.\u201cThe people pushing back on your decisions are those arguing for a tougher monetary policy, not a looser one,\u201d Mr. Garrett told Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, during the hearing in late February. \u201cThis flies in the face of the original stated rationale for political independence in monetary policy.\u201dBut she also found a striking shift: Democrats once proposed most bills to change the Federal Reserve but in recent years Republicans have taken their place, offering about two-thirds of such measures since 2010.Easy-money policies like those pursued by Mr. Bernanke and continued by Ms. Yellen historically have drawn support from populist politicians in both parties. But Ms. Binder suggested that Republicans were attacking those policies in part because Democrats had supported the Fed\u2019s efforts to fight unemployment, and the polarization of national politics encouraged the parties to accentuate their differences.\u201cYou now have these hard-money populists from the right who are concerned that monetary policy has been too lax and that the Fed needs to tighten,\u201d Ms. Binder said. \u201cIt\u2019s an inversion of what we might more typically see.\u201dA stronger measure, backed by the Republican leadership of the House Financial Services Committee, would require the Fed to publish a mathematical formula that it planned to follow in raising and lowering interest rates. The Fed would then be required to explain deviations from the path prescribed by the formula.There are also proposals to change the selection process for members of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, including a plan to strengthen the role of the banking industry in picking the presidents of the Fed\u2019s 12 regional reserve banks.So far, however, none of the measures have gained traction in the Senate, where Democrats still have considerable power to stall legislation. And the White House has expressed general opposition to restrictions on the Fed\u2019s autonomy.The Fed is charged by Congress with minimizing inflation and maximizing employment, a mandate formalized in 1978 by the Humphrey-Hawkins Act. Since the Great Recession, inflation has been unusually slow while jobs have been unusually scarce. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have described the Fed\u2019s actions as a necessary response to those circumstances.The \u201cAudit the Fed\u201d debate is the latest manifestation of a conflict as old as the nation, over the role of a central bank.\u201cThe root of the issue at this point, I can sum it up in two words, Humphrey and Hawkins,\u201d said Barney Frank, the former Massachusetts congressman. \u201cWhat you have is a vehement objection to the dual mandate. Many Republicans do understand that the atmospherics of repealing the unemployment part of the dual mandate would be very bad, but they are opposed to it philosophically.\u201dBills being put forward now, however, do not attack the dual mandate directly. The proposal to make the Fed adopt a policy rule, for example, includes a baseline rule that incorporates both inflation and a measure of economic output. But that rule, known as the Taylor Rule, suggests that the Fed has kept interest rates near zero for too long, and the bill would require the Fed to justify that choice.John Taylor, a professor of economics at Stanford University and the intellectual force behind the legislation, said that requiring the Fed to establish a policy rule would serve the same purpose as the checklists that some hospitals use to help doctors avoid errors.\u201cPractical experience and empirical studies show that checklist-free medical care is wrought with dangers just as rules-free monetary policy is,\u201d Mr. Taylor wrote in a recent defense of his proposal.The proposal also is intended to increase the Fed\u2019s accountability. \u201cWhat you want is something that permits you to see that the policies that are carried out are carried out for the benefit of the public,\u201d said Allan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cSo choose your strategy, and we monitor you.\u201dThe House Financial Services Committee passed the legislation along party lines last year, but it went no further. The author, Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who heads the monetary policy subcommittee, said in a statement that he remained determined to \u201cbring the Federal Reserve out of the shadows\u201d and that he planned to introduce a modified version of the legislation later this year.Fed officials say that they do consult rules in their deliberations, but that central banking is the art of knowing when to deviate from those rules. Mr. Bernanke said recently at the Brookings Institution that the Fed had articulated a policy rule: targeting 2 percent annual inflation and maximum employment.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can get much more precise than that because I don\u2019t think you can deal with the uncertainties that arise in actual policy-making,\u201d he said.The legislation would allow the Fed to change its policy rule as often as it liked, but opponents of the measure still worry that it would inhibit the Fed\u2019s flexibility.\u201cLaw can be very sticky,\u201d said Peter Conti-Brown, a scholar of central banking at Stanford Law School. \u201cThe thing that I fear about a statutory policy rule is that it would get stuck in inertia and make it very difficult to deviate even if there was a consensus among economists that there should be that deviation.\u201dThe current debate also has revived a struggle that dates to the Fed\u2019s creation in 1913. Republicans want to strengthen the independence of the Fed\u2019s regional reserve banks, whose presidents participate in monetary policy decisions, while Democrats want to strengthen the federal government\u2019s control.Legislation introduced by Mr. Garrett would let the regional banks select their own boards and increase the banking industry\u2019s representation on those boards. It would also let the banks pick presidents without Washington\u2019s approval.A countervailing bill introduced by Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, would make the president of the New York Fed a presidential nominee, subject to confirmation by the Senate. A coalition of community groups is pressuring the Fed to allow public input in the selection process for all regional Fed presidents.Most of these proposals are revivals of earlier legislation, from earlier periods of frustration, and Mr. Conti-Brown said it was quite likely nothing would change.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the month in which Representative Scott Garrett complained that Congress and the Federal Reserve had traded places. It was February, not last month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nigerian President-Elect Muhammadu Buhari Sets Out His Agenda", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKANO, Nigeria \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s president-elect, Muhammadu Buhari, did not smile while making his acceptance speech on Wednesday \u2014 understandably, as terrorism and corruption were his main talking points.The country is now a democratic nation like others, Mr. Buhari suggested Wednesday, both in his words and in the fact that the democratic process had worked well enough that he could give the speech at all.In pairing them so prominently, he appeared to be setting his agenda for the coming months. And in lieu of a detailed policy platform from Mr. Buhari, who was short on specifics during his campaign, his vow to defeat Boko Haram amounts to a national security strategy, while fighting corruption has become an economic one.On Wednesday, he focused more on the challenges posed by corruption than on the dangers of Boko Haram, perhaps indicating a veteran soldier\u2019s disdain for the group as a true military threat.\u201cBoko Haram will soon know the strength of our collective will,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cWe shall spare no effort until we defeat terrorism.\u201dIt is impossible to verify the Nigerian military\u2019s claim that nearly all the previously Islamist-occupied towns in the northeast \u2014 \u201clocal government areas,\u201d as they are called in Nigeria \u2014 have now been reclaimed from Boko Haram. But many have been, and the latest, Gwoza, had been a Boko Haram stronghold for months.More challenging for Mr. Buhari will be the rot in the army that led to Boko Haram\u2019s ascendance in the first place: corruption at high levels, poor morale, and troops underequipped because much of the $6 billion military budget has apparently been diverted.\u201cWhat they have is such an institutional problem, it\u2019s going to take a long time to fix it,\u201d said a diplomat in Abuja, who was not authorized to speak publicly. The hiring of mercenaries to defeat Boko Haram is a \u201cshort- to mid-term solution until they can address the other thing,\u201d the diplomat said.In interviews, Mr. Buhari has spoken of his anger at seeing foreign troops play a leading role in solving Nigeria\u2019s Boko Haram problem. But he may not have much choice for now.\u201cWhat has been consistently lacking is the required leadership in our battle against insurgency,\u201d Mr. Buhari said in a speech at the London think tank Chatham House in late February.Here, he will tread gingerly, Mr. Buhari has suggested, seeking to determine responsibilities before proceeding to, say, firing the top chiefs whom many blame for Nigeria\u2019s military failures.Boko Haram led Mr. Buhari on Wednesday to segue immediately into Nigeria\u2019s corruption problem, which \u201cattacks our national character\u201d and \u201cdistorts the economy,\u201d he said.He made it clear that, falling oil prices aside, he sees this as the country\u2019s top economic problem, telling the audience at Abuja\u2019s International Conference Center that \u201csuch an illegal yet powerful force soon comes to undermine democracy.\u201d He promised to \u201cend this threat to our economic development and democratic survival.\u201dMaps showing the violent rise of the Islamist militant group that is waging a campaign of terror in Nigeria.At Chatham House, Mr. Buhari suggested that what he called a \u201cwar waged on corruption\u201d would be the first step in tackling the country\u2019s pressing economic problems. The price of oil, on which the government depends for over 70 percent of its revenue, has tumbled. Nigeria\u2019s currency has fallen some 20 percent against the dollar over six months. Foreign currency reserves are dwindling, and an oil-revenue rainy day fund has been ransacked.\u201cIn the face of dwindling revenues, a good place to start the repositioning of Nigeria\u2019s economy is to swiftly tackle two ills that have ballooned under the present administration: waste and corruption,\u201d Mr. Buhari said at Chatham House.Several Nigerian economists suggested that Mr. Buhari\u2019s strategy was plausible as a first step.\u201cThe first thing to do is to recognize that there is so much waste in government,\u201d said a leading Lagos economist, Pat Utomi.\u201cIf you cut the graft, you can do things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a new presidential jet in this budget. Most airlines in Nigeria don\u2019t have as many jets as the presidential fleet.\u201dAnother economist also suggested that Mr. Buhari\u2019s anticorruption stance was critical in a country with, as a recent World Bank paper put it, a \u201cdeeply embedded culture of corruption.\u201dWith the new president\u2019s emphasis on \u201caccountability, integrity and transparency,\u201d one economist, Bismarck Rewane, said the \u201cmissing piece in the Nigerian economy\u201d would be filled in.Of course, other Nigerian politicians have promised to end corruption, only to fail or even steal with abandon afterward. But there is some reason to think Mr. Buhari may hew more closely to his promises. As military ruler in 1984 and 1985, he did not enrich himself. And he ruthlessly pursued those whom he accused of corruption.\u201cCorruption will not be tolerated by this administration, and it shall no longer be allowed to stand as if it is a respected monument in this nation,\u201d he said Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Talks With Cuba Earn U.S. Raves in Latin America", "Date": "2015-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From PanamaPANAMA \u2014 And the new star in Latin America is ... the United States?The reviews are in, and while the United States still faces plenty of tricky relations in a diverse region of 35 states, President Obama walked away with more salutes than swipes from a regional Summit of the Americas where the United States usually takes a drubbing.The question now is whether Mr. Obama and his successors can capitalize on the new credibility Washington has earned, primarily through his reconciliation with Havana.Mr. Obama sat down for an hourlong meeting with President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba, which the United States allowed to attend the summit for the first time since the meetings began in 1994. It was the first meeting between leaders of the Cold War-era foes.Mr. Obama also announced that Brazil\u2019s president, Dilma Rousseff, will be accorded a state visit to Washington in June, after she canceled one in 2013 over American tapping of her communications.He even briefly chatted with President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela, who just a few hours earlier had railed against American \u201cimperialist interference\u201d and threatened \u2014 but notably failed to deliver to Mr. Obama \u2014 a petition demanding that the United States lift sanctions against several Venezuelan officials accused of human rights violations.\u201cThe world of politics and diplomacy is, in good measure, one of grand symbols,\u201d the Mexican newspaper El Universal heralded Sunday in an editorial headlined \u201cA New Era in the Americas.\u201dIt was not all sweetness and light, however.Mr. Castro roasted the United States, at considerable length, over what he called its history of oppressing Cuba. The presidents of Venezuela, Bolivia and Argentina followed suit.Mr. Obama deflated expectations that he would announce Cuba was being removed from the American government\u2019s list of nations that sponsor terror \u2014 a designation that many regional leaders find baffling \u2014 or fix a date for the reopening of embassies. But for a region long tired of the mutual animosity and perplexed at the Cold War-era embargo, it seemed progress enough that the presidents were talking without hostility.Perhaps more important was the shift of tone at this year\u2019s meeting. The maligning from the left that had tended to dominate previous summits took a back seat as Mr. Castro called an American president \u201chonest\u201d and humble and even apologized for getting carried away with revolutionary rhetoric.Now, the question is how will the United States spend the considerable political capital it has accrued in the region to address vexing issues such as corruption, impunity and the fragility of democracy or, in the case of Cuba, its glaring absence?Mr. Obama acknowledged this at his news conference before leaving the summit Saturday, saying the United States was not giving up on democratic hopes for Cuba, just the approach.\u201cWe have very different views of how society should be organized and I was very direct with him that we are not going to stop talking about issues like democracy and human rights and freedom of assembly and freedom of the press,\u201d Mr. Obama said.But the United States may still find getting its point across in the region, directly or indirectly, a challenge as leaders take a more critical, \u201cget your own house in order\u201d eye to the polarization in Washington and the United States\u2019 own problems with justice.\u201cThese are societies that are not especially responsive to what Washington does or wants, and have not been for a long time,\u201d said Julia Sweig, a Cuba and Brazil scholar at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs in Austin, Tex.American sway in the region has been undercut somewhat paradoxically by the sweep of democracy since the 1970s and ever more flourishing economies \u2014 with the United States typically among the top trading partners. As a result, internal interests now routinely trump regional ones, especially when the United States is perceived as talking-down or resorting to heavy-handed tactics.In his remarks to world leaders at the summit, Mr. Obama sought to take this on, acknowledging the imperfections of American society but also bluntly telling his peers not to dwell on the past or use the United States as a scapegoat.\u201cAmerica never makes a claim about being perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can, I suppose, spend a lot of time talking about past grievances, and I suppose that it\u2019s possible to use the United States as a handy excuse every so often for political problems that may be occurring domestically.\u201cBut that\u2019s not going to bring progress,\u201d Mr. Obama continued. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to solve the problems of children who can\u2019t read, who don\u2019t have enough to eat. It\u2019s not going to make our countries more productive or more competitive in a global economy.\u201dStill, to its frustration, the United States has watched shades of authoritarianism show up among democratically elected leaders in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Ecuador and even Panama, where the host of the summit, President Juan Carlos Varela, was elected last summer by voters frustrated with the corruption scandals and autocratic control of his predecessor, Ricardo Martinelli.Until now, any American effort to push for regional consensus on a broad agenda that includes addressing climate change, drug trafficking and economic prosperity has been undercut by its refusal to have relations with Cuba and its isolation of it. Many countries talked a long time about Cuba\u2019s exclusion at previous summits.\u201cDespite really significant remaining differences in the region, by sweeping aside the Cuba problem I think you are going to see more leaders step up to the plate more on human rights and democracy,\u201d said Arturo Valenzuela, the State Department\u2019s former top diplomat for the region and a professor at Georgetown University.He predicted regional powers such as Brazil might reward the American reconciliation with a tougher stand on Venezuela; already few countries at the summit outside of Venezuela\u2019s closest allies joined its railing against the recent American sanctions.Mr. Valenzuela said topics at the summit that received scant attention from the news media, including regional leaders discussing an expansion of economic opportunities, addressing inequality and promoting the work of \u201ccivil society\u201d nongovernmental organizations to push for basic freedoms, might rise in importance, even in Cuba.\u201cAs you get more independent civil society they can push more for change from the inside,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is where it comes from.\u201dEric Hershberg, director of the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University in Washington, said Mr. Obama had been gaining ground in the region. It is not just his reaching out to Cuba but also his executive action on immigration, to allow more people in the country without authorization to get legal residency, he said.\u201cNow, we will see whether the administration can continue that momentum with engagement in Latin America and focus on the issues the region cares about,\u201d he said.\u201cThe United States,\u201d he added, \u201cneeds to avoid getting trapped in unproductive disputes that look like falling back into the old American heavy-handedness in the region.\u201dBecause of an editing error, the Memo From Panama article on Monday, about a possible new chapter in relations between the United States and Latin America after President Obama met the Cuban president, Ra\u00fal Castro, at the Summit of the Americas, referred incorrectly to the United States government\u2019s list of nations that sponsor terrorism, which includes Cuba. Although Cuba has been reluctant to agree to the reopening of embassies in Washington and Havana as long as it remains on the list, being on the list does not prevent Cuba or any nation from reopening embassies. (The White House announced on Tuesday that President Obama intends to remove Cuba from the terrorism list.)Advertisement"}

Its first 200 pages in particular are so claustrophobic that they send you back to Mr. Atlas\u2019s book with fresh eyes for its best qualities: its human scale, its economies of style, its sense of the sweep of Bellow\u2019s life and its rich understanding of his milieus. We\u2019re invested in Mr. Atlas\u2019s Bellow. Unlike Mr. Leader\u2019s, he is squirmingly alive.So here we are. The man who may well be the greatest American writer of the 20th century is now, biographically at least, to borrow the title of Bellow\u2019s first novel, something of a dangling man.The life-sapping nature of Mr. Leader\u2019s book derives primarily from its eagerness to take every possible detour along the way to relating Bellow\u2019s life. If Bellow had ever written the sentence \u201cThere once was a man from Nantucket,\u201d Mr. Leader would quote it along with two pages about the nature of man and three pages about the origins of Nantucket.You begin, while reading this volume, to fear nouns: They appear like links Mr. Leader is certain to click on and send himself down a rabbit hole. If the notion of motherhood comes into view, for example, we are off on how every mother has appeared in Bellow\u2019s oeuvre. (\u201cIn Bellow\u2019s fiction, there are hard mothers and soft mothers ...\u201d)These umpteen detours \u2014 on assimilation, brothers, businessmen, Judaism, petty crime, you name it \u2014 pluck one from Bellow\u2019s life for pages at a time. Mr. Leader prints nearly everything Bellow has said on each of these topics and others; his book can resemble a concordance more than a narrative. \u201cThe fact is a wire through which one sends a current,\u201d Bellow once said. In this book, each wire comes densely swaddled in cotton.The first three of Bellow\u2019s five wives appear in this volume, and the details of his many affairs are not skimped on. Bellow was a famous charmer, but he could also be thin-skinned, needy, suspicious, quick to explode. At least once he was said to be physically violent with Sondra, his second wife.It is typical of this book that Mr. Leader prints the details of this event (Sondra accused him of pulling her ponytail and punching her in the face) apologetically. \u201cThese accusations and counteraccusations are rehearsed here,\u201d he writes, \u201cbecause they are part of the life Bellow lived as he wrote \u2018Herzog\u2019 ... .\u201d Well, yes.Mr. Leader provides a particularly good sense of Bellow\u2019s work ethic. No matter what was happening in his life or where he was traveling, his work time was sacrosanct.There are signs that the second volume of this biography will rise to fuller engagement. With the publication of \u201cHerzog,\u201d Bellow is on his way to his widest fame, and antagonists like Norman Mailer \u2014 who called Bellow a mere \u201chostess of the intellectual canap\u00e9 table\u201d \u2014 have begun to emerge.About this very large first volume, however, words from Mr. Leader\u2019s previous biographic subject seem apt. Kingsley Amis liked to say that more means worse.THE LIFE OF SAUL BELLOWTo Fame and Fortune, 1915-1964By Zachary Leader812 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $40.The Books of The Times review on Wednesday, about \u201cThe Life of Saul Bellow: To Fame and Fortune, 1915-1964\u201d by Zachary Leader, referred incorrectly to Bellow\u2019s cooperation with James Atlas on Mr. Atlas\u2019s biography of him. Mr. Atlas says it is not the case that Bellow stopped cooperating with him before the book was published.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "That Old-Time Economics", "Date": "2015-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 America has yet to achieve a full recovery from the effects of the 2008 financial crisis. Still, it seems fair to say that we\u2019ve made up much, though by no means all, of the lost ground. Why has Europe done so badly? In the past few weeks, I\u2019ve seen a number of speeches and articles suggesting that the problem lies in the inadequacy of our economic models \u2014 that we need to rethink macroeconomic theory, which has failed to offer useful policy guidance in the crisis. But is this really the story?I\u2019ve been revisiting economic policy debates since 2008, and what stands out from around 2010 onward is the huge divergence in thinking that emerged between the United States and Europe. In America, the White House and the Federal Reserve mainly stayed faithful to standard Keynesian economics. The Obama administration wasted a lot of time and effort pursuing a so-called Grand Bargain on the budget, but it continued to believe in the textbook proposition that deficit spending is actually a good thing in a depressed economy. Meanwhile, the Fed ignored ominous warnings that it was \u201cdebasing the dollar,\u201d sticking with the view that its low-interest-rate policies wouldn\u2019t cause inflation as long as unemployment remained high. And while new ideas were crashing and burning, that old-time economics was going from strength to strength. Some readers may recall that there was much scoffing at predictions from Keynesian economists, myself included, that interest rates would stay low despite huge budget deficits; that inflation would remain subdued despite huge bond purchases by the Fed; that sharp cuts in government spending, far from unleashing a confidence-driven boom in private spending, would cause private spending to fall further. But all these predictions came true.The point is that it\u2019s wrong to claim, as many do, that policy failed because economic theory didn\u2019t provide the guidance policy makers needed. In reality, theory provided excellent guidance, if only policy makers had been willing to listen. Unfortunately, they weren\u2019t.But back to the question of new ideas and their role in policy. It\u2019s hard to argue against new ideas in general. In recent years, however, innovative economic ideas, far from helping to provide a solution, have been part of the problem. We would have been far better off if we had stuck to that old-time macroeconomics, which is looking better than ever. Advertisement"}

It is not surprising that the lenders who are now dealing in the subprime area are choosing different terminology to describe their products. The preferred adjectives these days are nonprime, non-QM (for qualifying mortgage) or \u201calternative.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not really running from the word subprime,\u201d said Tom Hutchens, the senior vice president for sales and marketing at Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions in Atlanta. \u201cIt\u2019s really just educating people about what the 2015 subprime is, no matter what their predisposition to the word is.\u201dThe kinds of nonqualified loans Angel Oak and many other nonbank lenders are now offering look more like the subprime products of the late 1990s, Mr. Hutchens said. \u201cThen, each layer of credit risk was mitigated with something else,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had some type of credit issue, for example, you had to put another 5 percent down or your rate was slightly higher.\u201dAngel Oak\u2019s nonprime rates range from around 5.5 percent to up to 9 percent for borrowers with a lower credit score or recent credit event, such as a foreclosure within the past year, he said.The biggest category being targeted consists of borrowers who do not qualify for a prime loan because of a single foreclosure or bankruptcy related to the recession. \u201cThey\u2019re not bad people \u2014 they had a life event,\u201d Mr. Hutchens said. Keith T. Gumbinger, the vice president of HSH.com, a financial publisher, noted that these borrowers must, like prime borrowers, meet the proof of ability-to-pay requirements put in place by regulators after the mortgage crisis. And that, along with the banning of many of the riskier mortgage products, makes this version of subprime quite different from the last go-round, he said. \u201cThe fact is,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s a necessary component of the marketplace. And it serves a function after coming out of a pretty severe recession.\u201d While a number of hedge funds and private equity firms are readily putting up the money to make these loans, the vast majority of subprime mortgages are being held in portfolio. The secondary market has yet to warm to the return of securities backed by subprime loans, and that should keep the volume of subprime loans from expanding much in the near future, said Noelle Savarese, a portfolio manager at MatlinPatterson, a global alternative asset manager. \u201cWe do not believe there is enough demand for that product\u201d for the market to grow in a substantial way, she said. \u201cThe investor community is still licking its wounds from the crisis.\u201dInvestors will want stronger protections written into representations and warranties, and more credit enhancement, said Marc Rosenthal, who manages a mortgage bond fund with Ms. Savarese. \u201cBut right now,\u201d Ms. Savarese said, \u201clenders can\u2019t charge these borrowers high enough rates to make it economically sound to sell these securities.\u201dCiting figures from Bank of America, Mr. Rosenthal noted that in 2006, subprime securitization volume hit a high of $534 billion.

The two center-left parties are partners in Denmark\u2019s coalition government.Jump-started an antitrust case against Google that has been inching along for five years. Her predecessor, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, tried and failed to reach a settlement three times with Google. Ms. Vestager has taken a more aggressive approach and has appeared not to have much appetite for a fourth round of settlement talks.She has accused Google of using its dominance as a search engine to \u201cartificially\u201d skew results that favor its own shopping service, to the detriment of rivals. \u201cDominant companies have a responsibility not to abuse their powerful market position by restricting competition either in the market where they are dominant or in neighboring markets.\u201dShe also announced that investigations would continue in other areas, including accusations that Google improperly uses its rivals\u2019 content and locks out advertising competition with exclusivity deals.

Despite that marathon climb, fund managers are still finding underappreciated stocks. The stewards of three of the top-performing funds of the first quarter grabbed gains in the health care sector and Japan.Why make that big bet? Mr. Vandeventer said he believed that genetic science was continuing to increase the ability of companies to create drugs that can zero in on particular cancers. He called that development \u201cone of the great revolutions we\u2019ll see in our lifetimes.\u201dFollowing so many stocks can be challenging. He has developed a quantitative screen he runs regularly against the thousands of mid- and small-capitalization stocks that he might buy. If the screen highly ranks a company that the fund does not own, Mr. Vandeventer starts digging to see what he might have missed.The fund, which has an expense ratio of 1.3 percent, returned 11.3 percent in the first quarter, compared with 0.95 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. It returned an annualized average of 18 percent over the five years ending March 31.Based on its price/earnings ratio, United Therapeutics looks cheap considering the growth rate of its earnings, said Lawrence G. Kemp, one of the fund\u2019s co-managers. United Therapeutics, known for its treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension, was recently trading at a P/E of 28.2, compared with an industry average of 47.4, according to Morningstar.Mr. Kemp and his co-managers have made an even bigger bet on consumer discretionary companies, which represented nearly 40 percent of assets at the end of February. Among their favorites is Netflix. The company leads its industry in technology and content spending, creating a high barrier for competitors, said a fund co-manager, Philip H. Ruvinsky. Netflix has built a dominant market position in the United States, and Mr. Ruvinsky said he expected the same abroad.Another entertainment holding is the Madison Square Garden Company, which owns sports teams, including the New York Knicks and Liberty basketball teams; cable channels; and other venues besides its arena. Mr. Ruvinsky said the market mistakenly valued the company based on current earnings, failing to account fully for the value of its \u201ctrophy assets.\u201d The Knicks, for example, are most likely worth billions, given that the Los Angeles Clippers sold last year for $2 billion, he said.The BlackRock managers separate their holdings into three baskets: superior, durable and periodic growers.

It returned an annualized average of 14.9 percent over the last five years.\u201cFor the past couple of decades, Japanese companies haven\u2019t been run in an aggressive manner,\u201d Mr. Ciganer said. \u201cEither they weren\u2019t run for shareholders or deflation was pressuring them so much that they couldn\u2019t be aggressive.\u201dMr. Ciganer said two developments changed the way Japanese companies operate: growth in the share of Japanese stocks owned by foreigners and a government, led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, committed to vanquishing deflation and reinvigorating the economy. \u201cThis could be a once-in-a-generation turning point,\u201d he said.Foreign investors like T. Rowe Price demand more transparency and responsiveness than Japanese companies typically provided, Mr. Ciganer said. When outsiders represented a smaller share of the market, those demands could be ignored. Now Japanese companies are hewing more to United States and European norms of governance, he said.Consider Japan Tobacco, one of the fund\u2019s top 10 holdings. \u201cIt was one of the first companies to be in this new wave of Western-style corporate governance,\u201d he said. \u201cThey stepped up the dividend payout, and they started buying back stock.\u201dEven holdouts have begun to change, like Fanuc, a maker of industrial robots. \u201cBefore, they wouldn\u2019t even meet investors \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t have results meetings or calls,\u201d Mr. Ciganer said. Lately, the company has said it will establish an investor relations department and start returning more cash to shareholders, he said.Mr. Ciganer took over the fund at the end of 2013. He had worked as analyst on it for the previous seven years, and he does not predict major changes in its investment style under his management. \u201cWe have a responsibility to our clients to not do anything revolutionary,\u201d he said.He has been selling off holdings to shrink the number of stocks; the fund held 75 at the end of last year. He said he believed that a more concentrated portfolio contributes to active management, adding that when managers do not concentrate, their funds can end up looking too much like their benchmark indexes. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a closet indexer,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople might as well buy an E.T.F.\u201dThe fund, with an expense ratio of 1.05 percent, returned 13 percent in the first quarter. It returned an annualized average of 7.9 percent over the last five years.Advertisement"}

The result is a new set of policy tools that promote the reuse \u2014 rather than the demolition \u2014 of historic properties.

Kawamura.A former state secretary of food and agriculture, Mr. Kawamura grows vegetables and strawberries south of Los Angeles in Orange County. He was relatively lucky, losing 15 percent of one green bean crop when his well went dry last June, two and a half weeks before harvest.Still, the fields have remained fallow since then. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have another farm, I would be out of business.\u201dDespite his worry over California\u2019s four-year drought and its weirdly warming winter, Mr. Kawamura remains optimistic about farmers\u2019 ability to adapt through human ingenuity. Irrigation systems have evolved from furrows to sprinklers to drips in the three generations since his family began farming in what is now the highly urbanized Los Angeles basin.These days, he said, there\u2019s a water district experimenting with human waste, extracting methane and hydrogen to use for fuel and injecting the water into the aquifer. Australians have developed a technique to irrigate with brackish water, using the brine as fertilizer and cleaning out the water for use on site. He also sees promise in techniques to harvest water from the air.Innovation, however, has a limit.But even if California moves to a more efficient system for allocating water among competing users \u2014 a big if \u2014 its problems are just beginning.In a nutshell, climate change is expected to increase rain or snowfall in areas that are already relatively wet and reduce it in areas that are already relatively dry, like the Southwest, Mexico and Australia. Dry areas, moreover, will be warmer, increasing loss of water through evaporation and transpiration.\u201cClimate change will steadily and fundamentally lower the baseline for water availability in the West,\u201d said Benjamin Cook, a co-author of the study affiliated with the Goddard Institute and Columbia\u2019s observatory.The state relies on a water cycle that has remained roughly stable for decades: Heavy snow falling in the Sierra in the winter accumulates as snowpack, holding water until it is needed in the dry summer. The state built a sophisticated conveyance and storage infrastructure based on these patterns.They are unlikely to hold in the future. Snowpack in the Sierra is at only 5 percent of its historical average. Less precipitation is falling as snow, and snow is melting five to 30 days earlier than in the last half-century. The risk is that water will fill reservoirs too soon, perhaps overflowing or evaporating early, leaving too little water available for the most critical months.Even if carbon emissions were to peak before midcentury, calculations by Mr. Cook and his colleagues suggest that the Southwest will still face an exceptionally high risk of suffering a mega-drought of a scale not seen since the \u201cMedieval Warm Period\u201d parched the region from about 1100 to 1300.With all due respect to the renowned ingenuity of Californians, adaptation looks like a daunting task. And the risk is that belief in our technological capabilities to adapt to whatever comes our way might get in the way of a more comprehensive response, going well beyond California\u2019s already ambitious renewable energy goals.\u201cI do think agriculture is an industry that is very resilient and adaptive,\u201d said Kate Gordon, a senior adviser to the Risky Business project and the head of the Energy and Climate Program at Next Generation, which promotes the development of advanced energy. \u201cBut there is a limit to that.\u201dIn coming years, Californians may find out what those limits really are.E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com \n Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}

It is about 20 times the 40.2 cents of earnings per share analysts expect in 2016.That is far above FedEx\u2019s median multiple of 15.3 times forward earnings over the last decade. The premium looks higher after considering TNT\u2019s fading earnings power. Analyst estimates for TNT\u2019s 2016 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization have fallen 22 percent over nine months, while estimates for earnings per share have dropped 27 percent, according to Datastream.Step back, though, and the FedEx move looks more sensible. It can probably run the business better.Also, the price is considerably lower than United Parcel Service\u2019s offer of \u20ac9.50 euros, which Euroepean regulators killed in 2013. With its archrival aside and no subsequent bidders, FedEx presumably did not feel obliged to pay a knockout price.The dollar\u2019s rally makes the deal even cheaper in FedEx\u2019s home currency: 30 percent lower than the UPS bid, analysts at Berenberg say. Any debt financing will be cheap too, since FedEx recently sold 50-year bonds with a 4.5 percent yield.FedEx is paying nearly \u20ac1.1 billion more than TNT\u2019s market value before the deal was announced. To have the merger make sense, FedEx does not need to match the \u20ac400 million to \u20ac550 million in annual synergies that UPS was counting on. With less overlap, it probably can\u2019t cut costs as much. But \u20ac150 million of pretax benefits, roughly a third of the UPS goal, with a tax rate of 25 percent, would do the trick, even if the gains are valued at a modest multiple of 10 times.Then consider the backdrop.

If and when that day arrives, FedEx will have a stronger, leaner business worth considerably more in dollars.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Endless War Over Money", "Date": "2015-04-07", "News": "Advertisement Battles over central banking have historically pitted financial elites who wanted to limit the availability of money, thus preserving its value, against farmers, businessmen and other borrowers who wanted money to be plentiful \u2014 and cheap. Each side has sometimes regarded the central bank as its great ally in that fight, and sometimes as its bitter enemy.Since the Great Recession the Fed has mostly sided with the borrowers, creating vast amounts of new money and holding short-term interest rates near zero. Inevitably, that has angered creditors, and sparked efforts to swing the pendulum in the other direction.The nation's first two central banks, both called the Bank of the United States, were private, for-profit organizations chartered by Congress. The first (1791-1811) was created to help the government pay its Revolutionary War debt, stabilize the country\u2019s currency and raise money for the new government. It was the dream of Alexander Hamilton, secretary of the Treasury, who overcame resistance from Thomas Jefferson (who wrote \u201cI believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies\u201d) and other Southern lawmakers. When its 20-year charter expired, Congress chose not to renew it. The Second Bank of the United States was chartered a few years later, in the aftermath of the War of 1812, after Congress decided it had a mistake. But it lasted just 17 years. President Andrew Jackson said the bank concentrated too much economic power with a corrupt moneyed elite and vetoed a bill to extend its charter in 1832. Supporters of the the bank rallied around Henry Clay, Jackson\u2019s opponent for reelection that year, but the \u201cBank War\u201d ended when Jackson won easily. United States Treasury funds were withdrawn and deposited in state banks; the nation would be without a central bank for more than 70 years. The headquarters of both banks still stand about a block apart in downtown Philadelphia.A severe financial crisis drove the economy into a deep recession in 1837, just one year after the demise of the Second Bank. Such crises became a recurring event in American life and, as the economy grew, so did their size and the frequency. Banks created the New York Clearing House as a private-sector backstop, but it proved inadequate for the task. The government also was hamstrung. In the absence of a central bank, the United States regulated the value of its currency by guaranteeing that dollars could be exchanged for gold, and sometimes silver. This meant the government could not respond to financial crises, and the resulting economic downturns, by increasing the supply of money. In 1907, yet another crisis was brought about by a failed attempt to corner the stock of the United Copper Company. Government officials and financial executives jerry-rigged a response: an emergency lending pool orchestrated by J. Pierpont Morgan. But the crisis proved to be a tipping point in the political debate about the need for a central bank. There was a growing political consensus that Wall Street needed a permanent fire department.In November 1910, Senator Nelson Aldrich met with a group of bankers at a resort on Georgia\u2019s Jekyll Island and hammered out a plan for a new central bank. The idea touched on many of the great political battles of the age: The states against Washington; Wall Street financiers against smaller banks, particularly in the South and West; populists against the Gilded Age elite. The bill that emerged from several years of debate, signed by President Woodrow Wilson, was an awkward compromise: There would be 12 privately owned reserve banks in major cities across the country, preserving the power of financial elites. But the banks would be overseen by a board of presidential appointees, including the Treasury secretary, granting the public a new measure of control over the financial system.Before the Fed was fully established, however, the old system took a final bow. A financial crisis struck in 1914, and roughly twice as many banks failed as in 1907.Instead of preventing crises, the Federal Reserve helped to cause the Great Depression. The Fed was supposed to manage the gold standard \u2014 to make sure the economy was not choked by a lack of money and a resulting spike in interest rates. Instead, the Fed was paralyzed by disagreements between regional banks and the central board. It let the money supply shrink by one-third. The result was the worst economic crisis in the nation\u2019s history.Congress responded to the Fed\u2019s failure by greatly increasing its power and responsibilities. In 1934 it authorized the president to devalue the dollar, beginning the long process of replacing the gold standard with a currency whose value is managed by the Fed. In 1935 it gave the Fed responsibility for \u201cthe general credit situation of the country.\u201d The act also removed the Treasury secretary from the Fed\u2019s board and created a new policy-making committee where board members would outnumber reserve bank presidents.The central bank now had the freedom to encourage growth by printing money, and the responsibility not to print too much. Politicians who were focused on short-term problems were quick to demand money and, for the next several decades, the Fed hesitated to say no.In 1942, at the request of the Treasury Department, the Fed agreed to hold down interest rates on government bonds to help finance military spending for World War II. It kept rates low for almost a decade, through the beginning of the Korean War, until rising inflation finally induced the Treasury to sign a 1951 accord affirming the Fed\u2019s autonomy to raise rates.In the 1960s, Wright Patman, a populist Democrat congressman from Texas and chairman of the House banking committee, repeatedly introduced legislation to roll back the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, maintaining that, in the Fed, \u201ca body of men exist who control one of the most powerful levers moving the economy and who are responsible to no one.\u201dAnd in 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson, who wanted cheap credit to finance the Vietnam War and his Great Society, summoned Fed chairman William McChesney Martin to his Texas ranch. There, after asking other officials to leave the room, Johnson reportedly shoved Martin against the wall as he demanding that the Fed once again hold down interest rates. Martin caved, the Fed printed money, and inflation kept climbing until the early 1980s.Congress finally formalized its demands in 1978. A recession in the mid-1970s had pushed the unemployment rate as high as 9 percent, and Democrats, frustrated by what they saw as the Fed\u2019s inadequate response, won passage of legislation establishing the so-called dual mandate. The Fed was instructed to pursue maximum employment and price stability.It turned out to be a high-water mark for Congressional interference. Inflation rose by 11 percent the following year, and President Jimmy Carter agreed to appoint a new Fed chairman, the independent-minded Paul A. Volcker. Over the next several years, Mr. Volcker would raise interest rates sharply, driving the economy into a deep recession but ultimately bringing inflation under control. President Ronald Reagan, meanwhile, made a point of respecting the Fed\u2019s independence. Volcker was still subjected to sharp Congressional pressure, but it was mostly political theater. The Fed had declared its independence.Between the great inflation of the early 1980s and the Great Recession that began in 2008, the Fed and the economy enjoyed more than two decades of relative peace and quiet, a period that Fed officials sometimes call the Great Moderation. Inflation trended downward and, except for a few short recessions, unemployment stayed down too. And Fed officials came to see these trends as a validation of their newfound independence.The Fed also began to change its secretive culture. The trend began reluctantly, under pressure from critics who argued that independence required transparency. In 1983, for example, the Fed promised Congress that it would begin to release its Beige Book, a summary of economic reports from its regional reserve banks, as a way of distracting attention from more important reports that it was determined to keep secret. But the Fed gradually concluded that transparency could increase the power of monetary policy. In 1994, it began to announce changes in policy at the end of each policy-making session. In 2004, it began to publish edited accounts of its discussions three weeks after each session. And in 2011, its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, began to hold quarterly news conferences.The Fed\u2019s long run as a political darling came to a crashing end in 2008. Its lax oversight of the financial system was one reason for the severity of the crisis, and the smartest guys in Washington had failed to see it coming. The Fed\u2019s response was also controversial: It provided expansive support for the financial system, preserving some of America\u2019s least popular companies, not to mention foreign banks. And then it embarked on an expansive stimulus campaign to revive the economy.In the aftermath of the crisis, Congress moved quickly to strengthen the Fed\u2019s regulatory responsibilities. It also imposed some limits on the Fed\u2019s ability to repeat its rescue of the financial system. But it is the stimulus campaign that has prompted the most controversy.In an inversion of the historical pattern, congressional Republicans have criticized the Fed for printing too much money, arguing higher inflation will be the inevitable consequence. And they have put forward proposals to constrain the central bank. One bill, known as \u201cAudit the Fed,\u201d would authorize the General Accountability Office to review the Fed\u2019s monetary policy decisions. Another approach, backed by the House Financial Services Committee, would require the Fed to publicly articulate a set of rules it intends to follow in making monetary policy, and then explain any deviations.Advertisement"}

He emphasized Iran\u2019s involvement in regional conflicts, most recently Yemen, and denounced an Iranian general\u2019s declaration in recent days that \u201cthe destruction of Israel is nonnegotiable.\u201d\u201cWell, I want to make clear to all: the survival of Israel is nonnegotiable,\u201d the prime minister declared on Friday. \u201cIsrael will not accept an agreement which allows a country that vows to annihilate us to develop nuclear weapons, period.\u201dIsrael is not a party to the talks, which aim to reach a final accord by June 30, and at times he has complained of being left out of the loop.

Boehner, a Republican, infuriating the White House and some Democratic members.He gave no hint of his next steps in the Friday statement, beyond the demand for recognition. While Mr. Netanyahu had not previously mentioned recognition in regard to Iran, he has made a similar call in recent negotiations with the Palestinians.Asked on Friday about Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s new demand, a State Department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, told reporters in Washington that the negotiations with Iran on the agreement were \u201conly about the nuclear issue.\u201dIn the Palestinian arena, Mr. Netanyahu has demanded not only the recognition of Israel\u2019s right to exist \u2013 something the leadership has already done \u2014 but recognition that Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people. Without that recognition, the prime minister argues, any peace deal would not necessarily portend the end of the long-running conflict.Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s statement on the Iran deal was his lengthiest and most detailed of the past week.It criticized the framework agreement, saying it leaves \u201cIran with a vast nuclear infrastructure,\u201d since it does not call for shutting facilities, destroying centrifuges or halting research and development. The prime minister also criticized the promise to \u201clift sanctions immediately,\u201d saying it \u201cwould greatly bolster Iran\u2019s economy\u201d and \u201cgive Iran thereby tremendous means to propel its aggression and terrorism throughout the Middle East.\u201d\u201cSuch a deal does not block Iran\u2019s path to the bomb,\u201d he said, reprising language he used in his speech to Congress. \u201cSuch a deal paves Iran\u2019s path to the bomb.\u201dThe alternative, he said, is not war, but \u201cstanding firm, increasing the pressure on Iran until a good deal is achieved.\u201dRick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Somali Militants Kill 147 at Kenyan University", "Date": "2015-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Somali militants burst into a university in eastern Kenya on Thursday and killed nearly 150 students in the worst terrorist attack since the 1998 bombing of the United States Embassy here, laying bare the nation\u2019s continuing vulnerability after years of battling Islamist extremism.A small group of militants, most likely between four and 10, roved from dorm to dorm, separating Christian students from Muslim students and killing the Christians, the authorities said. Students described being awakened before dawn by the sound of gunfire and fleeing for their lives as masked attackers closed in.Officials said that by the time Kenyan commandos cornered and killed the attackers on an upper floor, 147 people lay dead.The violence Thursday came just days after President Obama announced that he would visit Kenya in July, his first trip to his father\u2019s homeland since taking office. Mr. Obama had stayed away until now, at least in part out of concern about Kenya\u2019s public safety.The Kenyan authorities said that around dawn, the attackers stormed Garissa University College in the town of Garissa, about 90 miles from the Somali border. Though the college is in a predominantly ethnic Somali area of Kenya, it attracts students from across the country, many of them non-Muslim.In a statement early on Thursday, the Shabab said that its fighters had attacked the university early in the morning, separating Muslims from non-Muslims in an \u201coperation against the infidels.\u201dIn an audio message soon after, a Shabab spokesman, Ali Mohamoud Raghe, said the attack had been carried out because \u201cthe Christian government of Kenya has invaded our country,\u201d a reference to the Kenyan military\u2019s 2011 incursion into Somalia to oust the Shabab from its strongholds.He said the university had been targeted because it was educating many Christian students in \u201ca Muslim land under colony,\u201d a reference to the large Somali population in a part of Kenya that Somalia once tried to claim. He called the university part of Kenya\u2019s \u201cplan to spread their Christianity and infidelity.\u201dPresident Uhuru Kenyatta vowed to crack down on terrorists, and on Thursday, he abruptly ordered 10,000 police recruits to report to duty despite a court order saying they may have been selected through corrupt practices. Human rights observers have said that Mr. Kenyatta is trying to consolidate control and using the fear of terrorism to quash civil rights.On Thursday, panicked students streamed out of the besieged university with chilling stories of witnessing their classmates being killed. Augustine Alanga, 21, an economics student, said he had been asleep in his dormitory when the shooting began. He said he bolted from his room without stopping to put on his shoes, cutting his feet as he sprinted barefoot across the campus and into a nearby forest.\u201cWhen I looked back, I saw them,\u201d Mr. Alanga recalled. \u201cThere were five or six of them. They were masked. And they were shooting live rounds.\u201dThe authorities said the attack began when the gunmen killed two guards standing by the main gate of the university.Police officers nearby \u201cheard the gunshots and responded swiftly, and engaged the gunmen in a fierce shootout; however, the attackers retreated and gained entry into the hostels,\u201d a police statement said. \u201cSecurity agencies arrived and are currently engaged in an elaborate process of flushing out the gunmen.\u201dThe incursion managed to dislodge the Shabab from vital positions, but instead of pushing the Shabab threat farther from Kenya, it did the opposite: It brought more Shabab in.The Shabab\u2019s attacks on Kenya since 2011 have grown in scope and lethality. Many people thought it could not get worse than the siege on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, a gleaming symbol of Kenya\u2019s modernity, wealth and relative peace. But the attack on Thursday was by far the deadliest in Kenya since agents of Al Qaeda blew up the United States Embassy in Nairobi in 1998, killing more than 200, the vast majority of them Kenyans.Since then, the group has said that it tries to minimize Muslim casualties, though Muslims continue to be targets in many of its operations. During the shopping mall attack, gunmen separated Muslim from non-Muslim civilians by asking religious trivia questions. (\u201cWhat is the name of the prophet\u2019s mother?\u201d \u201cWhat is the name of his first wife?\u201d) The \u201cnonbelievers\u201d were killed on the spot.In a Shabab document that was found in Mali by The Associated Press, the group tried to justify its tactics, saying that \u201call Muslims must stay far away from the enemy and their installations so as not to become human shields for them,\u201d and that there was \u201cno excuse for those who live or mingle with the enemies.\u201dJeffrey Gettleman and Isma\u2019il Kushkush reported from Nairobi, and Rukmini Callimachi from New York.

{"Headline": "Has American Business Lost Its Mojo?", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past three decades, the American economy has become less vigorous. An extensive body of evidence shows that the public focus on the success of high-tech companies like Apple and Google masks an overall downward trend in key measures of business vitality.Until 2008, start-ups outpaced business failures by about 100,000 a year. But in the past six years, that number has suddenly turned upside down. There has been an underground earthquake.Figure 1, which is based on Clifton\u2019s analysis of census data, documents the decline in start-ups.The forces driving this trend include the increasing regulation of small businesses, corporate consolidation, more occupational licensing requirements and too few immigrants with high-tech skills. Ultimately, however, the political system itself appears to be making a significant contribution to the problem.Federal and state officials, often under pressure from major corporations seeking to stifle competition, have adopted a regulatory regime that makes the creation of new businesses more difficult.Many, if not most, of the reforms proposed by economists and other analysts require political action. At the federal level, this would require bipartisan support, an achievement often out of reach in a polarized system.Contemporary American politics have become an economic hindrance. Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., put it this way in an email to me:It\u2019s becoming more and more difficult to run a successful business in the United States without doing lobbying, campaign contributions and other deals with politicians. This I think is the most dangerous, I would even say nefarious, trend for the creativity of American business in general, and young and new businesses which we badly need in particular.The drop in new business start-ups should be seen in the context of other key indicators \u2014 for example, a lack of labor liquidity, which is a measure of \u201cthe rate at which workers leave one firm to go to another,\u201d according to Acemoglu.\u201cThe reason why it\u2019s so central is that this is the method via which the economy puts more of its resources into more productive areas,\u201d Acemoglu wrote.New firm creation feeds into this big time. If you don\u2019t create new firms, then workers are likely to remain locked up in their previous jobs or just go to unemployment because there aren\u2019t new, higher productivity jobs to which they can be reallocated.The U.S. economy experienced large, broad-based declines in labor market fluidity in recent decades. Long-term declines in job and worker reallocation rates hold across states, industries, and demographic groups defined by gender, education and age. Fluidity declines are large for most groups, and they are enormous for younger and less educated workers.The authors conclude:If our assessment is correct, the United States is unlikely to return to sustained high employment rates without restoring labor market fluidity.There are disputes over both the causes of and the possible remedies for the decline in business creation and labor fluidity. Politically, proposed reforms run the ideological gamut, from making it easier to fire workers to limiting the political power of big business.Business dynamism is really not a choice. If other economies exhibit more dynamic firm structures and thus faster innovation than we do, our firms will either gradually lose out or move their facilities abroad. Either outcome would augur poorly for mobility at home.Clifton, the Gallup C.E.O., is more dramatic:I don\u2019t want to sound like a doomsayer, but when small and medium-size businesses are dying faster than they\u2019re being born, so is free enterprise. And when free enterprise dies, America dies with it.Many of the economists I contacted support liberalized immigration policies, especially for immigrants with high-tech skills, but the issue remains divisive in Congress.Davis, of the University of Chicago, has more controversial reforms in mind. In an email, he suggested these two:First, \u201callowing employers to hire workers for extended probationary periods, during which they could be fired at will without running afoul of litigation risks related to anti-discrimination laws and exemptions.\u201d And second, \u201celiminating federal minimum wage requirements, or at least allowing states and municipalities to opt out of federal minimum wage requirements.\u201dMany liberal economists are critical of these proposals.Alan Krueger of Princeton, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, wrote in an email responding to my inquiry that \u201cfiring restrictions in the U.S. are very modest. Most employment relationships are \u2018at-will.\u2019 \u201dIn addition, Krueger said that he was \u201cskeptical of the argument that the minimum wage is a reason why business formation has slowed in the U.S.\u201d because \u201cthe value of the minimum wage after inflation is currently very low.The real value of the minimum wage was higher in the 1960s, when business formation was much higher.\u201dAcemoglu dismisses the role of the minimum wage: \u201cIt\u2019s so low in the United States, that\u2019s not going to be a factor.\u201dOne area of modest agreement among analysts of business development is what they see as the detrimental consequences of the growing practice by state governments of requiring licenses for a host of previously unlicensed occupations.Morris Kleiner, a professor at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Humphrey School of Public Affairs, finds that the share of workers in this country who must have licenses to do their jobs has grown sixfold over the past half-century.Jobs requiring a license run the gamut from \u201cfrom scrap metal recyclers in Louisiana to body artists in the District of Columbia,\u201d and include pest control applicators, emergency medical technicians, cosmetologists, athletic trainers, massage therapists and auctioneers, Kleiner writes.State licensing requirements make both job entry and job relocation across state borders more difficult, effectively restraining the movement of workers to more productive employment \u2014 discouraging labor liquidity. While some form of regulation of these jobs may be necessary to protect consumers and the public generally, Kleiner and others argue that in those cases, a system of certification transferable from state to state would help free up the job market.The importance of politics in the slowdown in business creation and labor fluidity is perhaps most interesting and most salient.James Bessen, a lecturer at the Boston University School of Law and former C.E.O. of the software company Bestinfo, argues that companies and lobbyists protecting their own self-interest have become a major force undermining business creativity and growth.At the state level, Bessen notes, corporations are suppressing competition by successfully lobbying for legislation to make \u201cit easy for employers to enforce non-compete agreements, which prohibit employees from leaving one company to join or start another in the same industry.\u201dPerhaps the most intriguing argument about economic stagnation is that political polarization itself is a significant factor.Polarization results in legislative gridlock, according to Davis et al. at a time when the status quo poses dangers: \u201cThe status quo is unattractive when the debt ceiling must be raised to avoid default, or fiscal adjustment is required for a sustainable debt path.\u201d In addition, polarization has resulted in the politicization of the regulatory system so that \u201cthe policy environment is now more prone to rapid swings between an aggressive regulatory stance and a more hands-off approach.\u201dInsofar as polarization is a significant factor in the decline of business dynamism, prospects for improvement are not good.The share who are ideologically consistent has doubled: 21 percent express either consistently liberal or conservative opinions across a range of issues \u2013 the size and scope of government, the environment, foreign policy and many others.At the same time, according to Pew, the ideological left and right have gained leverage in the political process, and are more likely than moderates \u201cto vote regularly, and far more likely to donate to political campaigns.\u201d In addition, these influential partisans are far less willing to compromise than centrist voters, making polarization ever more intractable.In theory, elections are designed to put in office politicians skilled at winning enactment of legislation. At the moment, however, polarization is resulting in the election of men and women who are opposed to governing, if governing requires them to compromise.In these circumstances, the economy will be held hostage in the battle for supremacy between two ideological poles, with no relief in sight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany and Greece Locked in a Mutual Obsession", "Date": "2015-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropeBERLIN \u2014 Lest Greeks forget, the Germans are watching. Closely.When the leftist Syriza-led government was elected in Greece on Jan. 25, public broadcasters broke into Germany\u2019s favorite crime series to announce the result. Television stations went live to Athens several times that night.Years of crisis over Greece\u2019s finances have often pitted Europe\u2019s weakest economy against Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse. German admiration for ancient Greece \u2014 dating back at least to Goethe \u2014 has given way to hard-nosed pragmatism, even in the face of increasing hardship in Greece.Having contributed the largest share of the 240 billion euros, or $255 billion, of credits extended to Athens, Germany believes that it has done the most to keep Greece solvent and in the eurozone. And Germans keep tabs on their money.Journalists and politicians here fret daily about Athens\u2019 willingness to keep agreements with international creditors, or, by accident or design, leaving the eurozone. Complex graphs on Greek debt are a staple of newscasts that veer from patronizing to panicky. Less seriously, they ponder whether Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, 40, will ever wear a tie.For weeks, the countries\u2019 finance ministers sparred almost daily. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Mr. Tsipras called a halt when the Greek leader came to Berlin and was received with full honors. But tempers were not assuaged for long. As Mr. Tsipras headed to Moscow last week, his deputy finance minister declared that Germany owed Greece \u20ac287 billion in reparations for the Nazi occupation in World War II.That argument over compensation for tens or hundreds of thousands of deaths, and repayment of a forced loan, has endured for decades. Ms. Merkel\u2019s government insists that the matter is closed, while recognizing continued \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d for war crimes.Some opposition figures in Germany are open to new payments to Greece. But the latest demand tested even Ms. Merkel\u2019s vice chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the center-left Social Democrats.\u201cHonestly, I find it stupid,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said. \u201cThe Greeks have an interest in opening up space for a changed policy. That has nothing at all to do with World War II, or reparations.\u201dPredictably, in the Greek echo chamber, Mr. Gabriel was presented as branding all Greeks as \u201cdumb.\u201d German politicians, meanwhile, backed by a Brussels chorus, worried that Greece would break ranks on sanctions against Russia over Ukraine.The visit to Moscow was \u201ca threatening gesture,\u201d thundered Elmar Brok, a Merkel party ally and veteran of European politics. Martin Schulz, the German who heads the European Parliament, warned Greece not to seek \u201csolidarity\u201d in Moscow and to remember which government (Europe, Germany) had shown the most \u201csolidarity\u201d to date.Hundreds of thousands of Germans and Greeks living in each other\u2019s country feel squeezed.Jens Bastian, a German economist in Greece for 16 years, was on morning television in Germany last week, pleading for calm. \u201cI am often surprised and frustrated\u201d by the German news media, he said by telephone afterward. \u201cTone it down,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t get hysterical.\u201dMeanwhile, he says, the Greek news media seizes on almost any utterance about Greece for at least 10 minutes of any evening\u2019s hourlong newscasts.That attitude compounds what he calls two mistakes of the Greek government. First, it won a mandate not for change in Europe, but for \u201ca change \u2014 or at least attempting one \u2014 in Greece.\u201d Second, \u201cyou cannot take a confrontational approach to Germany,\u201d a main creditor and trade and political partner. \u201cYou need to have Germany on side, not off.\u201dPigi Mourmouri, 67, a retired social worker from Greece who has lived in Berlin for over 40 years, resents some of what she sees here. \u201cI have felt bad, because I had to justify myself,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that is not a good feeling.\u201d Besides, the \u201carrogance and superiority\u201d of some German news outlets is hard to miss.Instead of advancing European unity, as the euro was supposed to do, she said, people are thrown back on themselves.\u201cYou feel it in small ways,\u201d she said, citing a carnival two years ago. The host welcomed her and a friend warmly but ignored them once he realized that they were Greek. From both Germany and Greece, she said, \u201cI try to take the best. That is a luxury I still have.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drought Frames Economic Divide of Californians", "Date": "2015-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Parched WestCOMPTON, Calif. \u2014 Alysia Thomas, a stay-at-home mother in this working-class city, tells her children to skip a bath on days when they do not play outside; that holds down the water bill. Lillian Barrera, a housekeeper who travels 25 miles to clean homes in Beverly Hills, serves dinner to her family on paper plates for much the same reason. In the fourth year of a severe drought, conservation is a fine thing, but in this Southern California community, saving water means saving money.The challenge of California\u2019s drought is starkly different in Cowan Heights, a lush oasis of wealth and comfort 30 miles east of here. That is where Peter L. Himber, a pediatric neurologist, has decided to stop watering the gently sloping hillside that he spent $100,000 to turn into a green California paradise, seeding it with a carpet of rich native grass and installing a sprinkler system fit for a golf course. But that is also where homeowners like John Sears, a retired food-company executive, bristle with defiance at the prospect of mandatory cuts in water use.\u201cThis is a high fire-risk area,\u201d Mr. Sears said. \u201cIf we cut back 35 percent and all these homes just let everything go, what\u2019s green will turn brown. Tell me how the fire risk will increase.\u201dNow, California is trying to turn that dynamic on its head, forcing the state\u2019s biggest water users, which include some of the wealthiest communities, to bear the brunt of the statewide 25 percent cut in urban water consumption ordered by Gov. Jerry Brown. Cowan Heights is facing a 36 percent cut in its water use, compared with 8 percent for Compton.Other wealthy communities that must cut 36 percent include Beverly Hills and Hillsborough, a luxury town in Silicon Valley. Along with Compton, other less wealthy communities facing more modest cuts include Inglewood, which has been told to reduce its water consumption by 12 percent over what it was in 2013.The looming question now, with drought regulations set to be adopted next month, is whether conservation tools being championed by this state \u2014 $10,000-a-day fines for water agencies, higher prices for bigger water users or even, in the most extreme cases, a reduction in water supplies \u2014 will be effective with wealthy homeowners. Since their lawns are more often than not tended to by gardeners, they may have little idea just how much water they use.As it is, the legality of conservation \u2014 the practice of charging higher water rates to people who consume more for big water use \u2014 came under question when a court ruled that a tiered-pricing system used by an Orange County city ran afoul of the State Constitution and sent it back to allow the city to try to bring it into compliance.\u201cThen it becomes a moral question,\u201d she said. \u201cBut lots of wealthy people don\u2019t pay their own bills, so they don\u2019t know what the water costs.\u201dIn Compton, where residents often pay their bills in cash or installments, lawns are brown and backyard pools are few or empty. In Cowan Heights, where residents are involved in a rancorous dispute with a water company over rate increases, water is a luxury worth paying for as homeowners shower their lush lawns and top off pools and koi ponds.\u201cJust because you can afford to use something doesn\u2019t mean you should,\u201d said Aja Brown, the mayor of Compton, as she sat in her second-floor office with windows overlooking the light-rail Blue Line tracks that cut through town. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together. We all have to make sure we consume less.\u201dHints of class resentment can be heard on the streets of Compton.\u201cI have a garden \u2014 it\u2019s dying,\u201d said Ms. Barrera, the housekeeper, as she left the water department at Compton City Hall, where she had just paid a $253 two-month water bill. \u201cMy grass is drying. I try to save water. In Beverly Hills, they have a big garden and run laundry all the time. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dRod Lopez, a contractor from Compton who tends to homes here and along the wealthy Newport Beach coast, said he was startled at the different attitudes he found toward water consumption in communities just 30 miles apart.\u201cI work in Newport Beach: I see water running all day long,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten so tight over here. Everything is irrigated over there. They may get fined for it \u2014 they don\u2019t care. They have the money to pay the fines.\u201dCompton and Cowan Heights, which is 10 miles from Disneyland, could hardly be more different, and it is not only a matter of water. The median household income in Compton is $42,953, and 26 percent of the population lives below the poverty line; 67 percent of the population is Hispanic. In North Tustin, the census-designated community that includes Cowan Heights, the median household income is $122,662, and less than 3 percent of the population lives below the poverty line; 84 percent of the population is white.An interactive map shows how much water California residents conserved in April and how much daily consumption they are being forced to cut under new mandatory restrictions.Since the first homes sprang up in Cowan Heights in the 1950s in what had been hilly horse pastures, water and money have made this neighborhood of doctors, lawyers and wealthy retirees bloom. Even as the drought has worsened and water rates have climbed, residents have continued consuming hundreds of gallons a day and paying \u2014 albeit with more than a little grousing \u2014 water bills that have soared to $400 or $500 a month.Many people say they are trying to use less: They are capping their sprinkler systems, installing expensive new drip-watering systems or replacing their thirsty lawns with starkly beautiful desert landscapes. But they can also afford to buy their way out of the drought, assuming that fines will be the primary punishment for those who do not conserve, and that the water will keep flowing for those who can pay.Some Cowan Heights residents say their neighbors have enough money not to pay heed to rising prices, and are content to let their landscapers use as much water as necessary to keep their homes in bloom. Landscapers\u2019 trucks are parked around nearly every twisting road, tending to avocado and lemon trees, plush lawns, and riots of purple hibiscus and scarlet bougainvillea.On Deerhaven Drive, Craig Beam and his wife saw their water-scarce future after a landscaper stomped at the base of their Chinese elm and declared the roots hollow and parched. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to go broke around here paying their water bills,\u201d Mr. Beam said.Still, in a sign that even the wealthy have their limits, the drought is exacerbating a dispute between Cowan Heights residents and their for-profit water provider, the Golden State Water Company, offering a glimpse of fights to come as local water agencies impose higher prices to meet California\u2019s new conservation mandates. The neighborhood is bristling with lawn signs reading, \u201cStop the Water Ripoff!\u201dResidents complain their water bills have soared as Golden State Water imposed a three-tier pricing system that charges more for higher water use, the kind of conservation pricing that state water regulators are championing. The company is now seeking to add a fourth, even higher price tier. \u201cGolden State Water\u2019s rates reflect the true cost to operate and maintain the water system,\u201d said Denise Kruger, a senior vice president of the company.That has not appeased water users.\u201cWater is a necessity of life,\u201d said Mr. Sears, the retired food-company executive, whose bimonthly water bills regularly run $400 or $500 but went as high as $756 last September. \u201cIt should not be sold as a commodity.\u201dThirty miles away, the economy in Compton is on the upswing as this region comes out of the recession. Still, Compton Boulevard, the axis around which the 127-year-old community was settled, is filled with reminders of the poverty and crime that are still here: Check-cashing stores and bail bondsmen. Many homes have gates over their windows.Compton has a storied history of gang wars and has produced some of the bigger names in rap music, including Kendrick Lamar and Ice Cube. The unemployment rate in Compton was 11.8 percent in February, compared with 6.7 percent statewide. (There are no comparable numbers for Cowan Heights, since it is an unincorporated region.)This city is a neat grid of postage-stamp-size front lawns, many of them brown or choked with weeds. There are few pools or ornamental fountains in this part of the county; the fountains in front of City Hall have been turned off.After not budging for 25 years, water prices began rising in 2005 and have increased about 93 percent since then. The city, which has 81,963 water consumers, has also set up a two-tiered system to charge heavier users more, though it remains to be seen if that and other tiered systems will be challenged in the wake of the court ruling in Orange County last week. A typical water bill here is $70 a month.\u201cTo me the issue is keeping down the cost,\u201d said Ms. Thomas, 41, the stay-at-home mother. \u201cConservation is a cost-saving thing for me.\u201d She leaned over the fence of her home that she shares with her husband and children, looking over her compact patch of lawn that surrounds her home and another small cottage, where her mother lives.Chad Blais, the deputy director of public works at Compton, said people often paid their water bill in cash or pleaded for an extension. \u201cWe do have a large community that is month-to-month on their pay,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a high water usage mainly because they can\u2019t afford it. They\u2019ll call and tell us they\u2019re choosing to pay for food or medicine.\u201dUnder Governor Brown\u2019s 25 percent statewide reduction order, about 400 local water agencies are responsible for cuts ranging from 4 percent to 36 percent. Water companies are limiting how often people can water their yards \u2014 twice a week for Golden State customers \u2014 and barring them from washing down pavement or using drinking water to wash a car.If water providers cannot get customers to conserve enough voluntarily, they can resort to financial penalties: Golden State said it would fine offenders in Cowan Heights and other communities it serves $500 a day.\u201cIt is somewhat of an outlier,\u201d Toby Moore, the chief hydrogeologist for Golden State Water, said of Cowan Heights. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of investment into those properties, so water use is higher to address the landscaping of those properties.\u201dSome people in Cowan Heights are planning to let their lawns go brown, though more out of a spirit of conservation than economic necessity.\u201cWe\u2019ll replace that with rocks,\u201d said Dr. Himber, the neurologist, as he and his landscaper walked the grounds.Ms. Lord, the blogger, walked around her home, tucked amid flower-splashed hillsides behind a stately automated gate, and surveyed her roses with a fatalistic eye. \u201cDoomed,\u201d she said, nodding at the flowers, blooming wedding-white and dance-hall pink. \u201cDoomed.\u201dAbout 80 percent of the water in this state is used by agriculture, so the amount of water that might be saved by cuts in wealthy and relatively sparsely populated areas will not be large.But the disparity in behavior is a matter of concern among state water regulators, as is the worry that high prices will not have the same kind of impact on water use in, say, Cowan Heights as they might in Compton.Ms. Barrera, the housekeeper, said she had thought she was doing her part, and she spoke of the lush gardens and sweeping pools she sees in Beverly Hills.\u201cI\u2019m using a lot less,\u201d Ms. Barrera said. At that, she glanced down at the just-paid water bill she was still holding in her hand. \u201cBut I guess it\u2019s not enough.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.videoAdvertisement"}

On Tuesday night, the city began the first of what officials say will be a seven-day curfew, with all residents required to stay off the streets from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.For restaurants, bars, taxicabs and others that rely on nighttime customers, it is a potential economic disaster.\u201cThe families were just devastated,\u201d Ms. Goad said. \u201cThere\u2019s the ripple effect to all of this.

Surrounded by the remains of the week\u2019s devastation, Mr. Bush said he is confident his shop will withstand whatever comes next. \u201cThe community takes care of us,\u201d he said. \u201cSince some foolish people have taken away the CVS and some of the grocery stores, we might even do a lot more business.\u201dGov. Larry Hogan of Maryland declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard when riots broke out after the funeral of Freddie Gray.Some business owners are battening down the hatches as they wait for the next few days to unfold. Many of the shops around Neal\u2019s hair salon have already boarded up their windows as a deterrent. \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken and saddened for all of us,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the kids who feel they need to act out, the shop owners, the police \u2014 all of us are victims in this.\u201dShe is determined to keep her shop\u2019s large glass window exposed and lit. \u201cI\u2019m not boarding up,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the face I want to show to the community, and I don\u2019t want my daughter to feel caged in by this situation.\u201d She, too, is worried about what will happen when prosecutors decide whether or not to charge the officers involved in Mr. Gray\u2019s death, but she is hopeful that Baltimore\u2019s community has hit a turning point. \u201cI\u2019m going to stand on faith,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.

{"Headline": "Barbara Bergmann, Trailblazer for Study of Gender in Economics, Is Dead at 87", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBarbara Bergmann, a pioneer in the study of gender in the economy who herself overcame barriers to women in the world of academic economics, died on April 5 at her home in Bethesda, Md. She was 87.Her son, David Martin Bergmann, confirmed the death. [In a later interview, he said she committed suicide.]Ms. Bergmann was an emeritus professor at both American University and the University of Maryland, and she continued to research, publish and consult until very recently.Sixty years ago, Ms. Bergmann did not need to sift through economic data to find evidence of discrimination. When she was a graduate student at Harvard in the mid-1950s, one library at the university was off-limits to women, Alice Rivlin, a fellow Ph.D. student who went on to become vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve and director of the Office of Management and Budget in the 1990s, said in a telephone interview on Friday.Women had just begun to be permitted to work as teaching fellows at the time, Ms. Rivlin added, and they took exams separately from their male counterparts.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an atmosphere that was very congenial to women,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was hard to get an academic job unless you wanted to teach at a women\u2019s college.\u201dMs. Bergmann persisted. She initially taught at Harvard as an economics instructor after earning her Ph.D. there in 1958, and joined the White House Council of Economic Advisers in 1961 as a senior staff economist.After working at Brandeis University and the Brookings Institution, Ms. Bergmann joined the University of Maryland faculty in 1965, teaching there until 1988. She taught economics at American University from 1988 to 1997.Long a liberal voice in the field, Ms. Bergmann was a fierce critic of the laissez-faire policies then being advocated by the Reagan administration, and of proposed cuts to social programs that dated to the New Deal.In that piece, she predicted that the advent of computers and an \u201can electronic revolution in the office\u201d would decimate the need for typists, secretaries and clerical workers, who tended to be women.She noted the downward pressure this might have on wages in some fields, and argued that while technological change and greater productivity might be a good thing economically, existing barriers to women in the work force might make finding new jobs difficult and worsen poverty.\u201cWill high-status people be willing to type their own documents in the future?\u201d she asked. \u201cThough the stigma runs deep, the spreading use of the computer for tasks other than word processing may succeed in removing the stain from the activity of typing on the job.\u201dIn addition to frequent articles in academic journals, Ms. Bergmann was the author of a well-received history of women in the workplace, \u201cThe Economic Emergence of Women.\u201d It first appeared in 1986 and was reissued in a new edition in 2005.The book traces how women began joining the labor force in considerable numbers in the 19th century, well before the rise of modern feminism. Nor was leaving the home and working for hire a result of changing attitudes, Ms. Bergmann wrote; she concluded that economic forces made women\u2019s labor too valuable to be confined to domestic work.In the late 20th century, Ms. Bergmann called for the government to do more in the marketplace on behalf of women and single-parent families, including support for increased access to day care and the passage of legislation mandating comparable pay for women and men.In her book, Ms. Bergmann proposed reforms \u201cthat she concedes will have to await a less traditional, more egalitarian administration,\u201d the author Wendy Kaminer concluded in a review in The Times in October 1986.Barbara Rose Berman was born July 20, 1927, in the Bronx to Eastern European immigrants. She earned a B.A. from Cornell in 1948 before going on to receive her M.A. and Ph.D. in economics at Harvard. In 1965 she married Fred H. Bergmann, a microbiologist at the National Institutes of Health; he died in 2011.In addition to her son, Ms. Bergmann is survived a daughter, Sarah Nellie Bergmann, and three grandchildren.Whether at Harvard in the 1950s or during the Reagan era, Ms. Bergmann was ready to challenge the prevailing orthodoxies of the time, Ms. Rivlin said.\u201cBarbara was always quite outspoken and forceful in her views,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was never shy about them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The sales employees were either inattentive or cloying, the finances opaque, and the whole process was time-consuming and inconvenient. At one dealership recently, a salesman asked Ms. Lo, \u201cAre you here with your parents?\u201dSo a few weeks ago, Ms. Lo did what anyone her age does when confronted with a hurdle in the real world: She escaped it virtually.

Yet after just a year of operation in California, Beepi is now buying and selling hundreds of cars a month and is on track to book revenue of $100 million over the next year, the company said. The start-up has raised nearly $80 million in financing and it plans to expand to seven additional regions nationwide by the end of the year.Yet Beepi and others are coming up against some previous examples of online car sales that didn\u2019t take off. EBay, for instance, has long offered cars, but its business remains small. Still, the Internet has been edging into car purchases in other ways: Craigslist and AutoTrader long ago replaced classified auto listings, while Edmunds and TrueCar have tried to bring transparency to the market.Beepi began with a lemon of a used car. A few years ago, Ale Resnik, who was then at business school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, bought a 2010 Jeep Liberty from a dealership. The car caught fire while his wife was driving it and the dealer didn\u2019t want to take it back. To Mr. Resnik, the failure seemed out of step with the way he shopped for most goods; it lacked transparency and consumer friendliness.\u201cWe just thought that the car market was broken,\u201d Mr. Resnik said.At the core of Beepi\u2019s business model is a pricing trick. There are three relevant prices for any used car. The trade-in price, which is what a dealer will give you for your car; the private sales price, which is what you can get if you sold it directly to someone else; and the retail price, which is the price the car will command at a dealership. Dealers pay the trade-in price for vehicles and then sell them at the retail price. On some cars, that spread can be worth 50 percent.Beepi thinks it can make a profit while operating within a tighter pricing band. When you list your car with the site, the company\u2019s pricing algorithm, which consults data on historical car sales in your area, offers a price at least $1,000 more than you can get by trading in your car at the dealer. That is still less than what you would get selling privately, but Beepi\u2019s price is guaranteed. If your car doesn\u2019t sell within 30 days of listing on Beepi, the company will buy it from you.On the other side of the transaction, Beepi sells cars at prices lower than comparable certified used cars at dealerships. It can do so, the founder says, because its overhead is lower \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have to maintain parking lots to house cars, because the vehicles stay with the sellers until they are sold. Also, because it buys and sells cars over a wide area \u2014 currently, any city in California and Arizona \u2014 it can take advantage of supply and demand disparities in different regions. Finally, Beepi caps its own fee at 9 percent, depending on price and demand (it will take as little as 1 percent).\u201cWhen you put it together, we think you can give more to sellers, more to buyers, and make up to 9 percent of the price,\u201d Mr. Resnik said.But if Beepi is faster, more convenient, and a better financial deal than the traditional car market, it also suffers one huge downside. Beepi does not let buyers test-drive cars before buying. Instead, it takes a page from other online retailers\u2019 return policies. Like a pair of shoes from Zappos, Beepi\u2019s cars come with a 10-day, try-it-out money-back guarantee. If you aren\u2019t satisfied, the company will send a truck to take the car away free.The company positions this as better than a dealer\u2019s test-drive. \u201cIt\u2019s a 10-day test drive,\u201d Mr. Savir said. But that could be a tough sell.David Greene, an auto industry analyst for Cars.com, said he was skeptical that a large fraction of buyers would ever buy without test-driving a car.\u201cOur research shows that people don\u2019t exactly know what they need until they get in a car and drive it,\u201d Mr. Greene said. \u201cWhile there\u2019s a lot of things that people don\u2019t care for when visiting dealerships, it\u2019s hard to replace that personal interaction online.\u201dAnd if car buyers begin test-driving cars at dealerships only to buy at Beepi \u2014 the \u201cshowrooming\u201d problem that has bedeviled many offline retailers \u2014 dealers may begin lobbying against Beepi\u2019s rise, Mr. Greene said.Nicholas Hinrichsen, co-founder of Carlypso, a Beepi competitor that sells cars online on a slightly different business model, was skeptical that Beepi could maintain its money-back guarantee as it grows. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly expensive,\u201d Mr. Hinrichsen said, \u201cand my business model wouldn\u2019t be able to bear that.\u201d On Carlypso, you can return a car if it\u2019s defective, but not if you simply don\u2019t like it.Mr. Resnik of Beepi said these weren\u2019t concerns for him. So far, he said, only a handful of people have returned their cars, at a rate \u201cmuch, much lower than 1 percent.\u201d And he isn\u2019t worried that there won\u2019t be consumer demand in buying cars without a test-drive. \u201cAs people buy more and more online, they\u2019re getting used to it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "India, Seeking a Boost, Plans to Put Its \u2018Idle Gold\u2019 to Work", "Date": "2015-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 Just after 10:15 every night, the three stone goddesses of Mahalakshmi Temple are stripped of their finery \u2014 the gleaming masks, said to contain 17 pounds of gold; ropy gold necklaces; pendants shuddering with jewels.The treasure is transported to a \u201cstrong room,\u201d where it remains until morning alongside decades\u2019 worth of offerings given to the deities. Sharadchandra V. Padhye, who heads the temple\u2019s managing trust, would not give the value of what is kept in the room, but made it clear that it was vast.\u201cThe lady goddesses are also receiving nose rings,\u201d he said. \u201cAmple nose rings we have got.\u201dIn his mission to build India\u2019s economy into one that could someday rival China\u2019s, Prime Minister Narendra Modi would like to mobilize the roughly 20,000 tons of gold thought to be in private hands, 2,500 tons of it in major Hindu temples. Demand here is so high that gold imports have in recent years accounted for nearly 30 percent of India\u2019s trade deficit, and many people prefer to keep it in the form of jewelry, making it difficult to trade or convert into cash.Economists call it \u201cidle gold,\u201d and Mr. Modi\u2019s team would like to see it used for trade and investment. In May, the government is expected to introduce a plan to induce Indians to deposit gold in banks, offering fixed interest rates for a \u201cmetal account.\u201d There are also plans to issue gold bonds and, for the first time, to issue gold in the unsentimental but fungible form of a coin.But it is an experiment that will run up against old habits and deep emotions. This month, though details of the plan were not yet public, spokesmen for some of India\u2019s richest temples were already offering blustery opinions pro and con.\u201cThese are habits that developed over hundreds and thousands of years,\u201d Jayant Sinha, India\u2019s minister of state for finance, said in an interview. He said temple trusts, in particular, had been forced to think like endowments, weighing strategies to protect their wealth.\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of both the commercial logic as well as the confidence people have in the government,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as interest is concerned, that is a classic case of getting the percentage right.\u201dPrevious drives to monetize gold have mostly fallen flat. Analysts blame interest rates that were too low to attract large entities and a minimum gold deposit so high that it excluded small entities, like private households.But the efforts also encountered visceral distrust of state interference with temple wealth, and some of that has emerged this week, including from right-wing Hindu organizations that are aligned with Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party.A top official at the Vishway Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council, said the organization opposed any effort to monetize temple gold, despite \u201cfull support\u201d for Mr. Modi\u2019s government.\u201cFor thousands of years, Hindu society has donated this gold to temples whose trusts have safeguarded it,\u201d said Vyankatesh Abdeo, the organization\u2019s all-India secretary. \u201cOur wealth is in gold; the government\u2019s evil eye is on this wealth. This is absolutely wrong, and we oppose this move. This wealth is God\u2019s, not the government\u2019s.\u201dMr. Padhye, who heads the trust at the Mahalakshmi Temple, was similarly dismissive. He said donors gave jewelry to the deities in his temple out of a \u201cfeeling of attachment,\u201d and would be upset if they learned their gifts had been taken away.\u201cWe will not give up our gold,\u201d he said. \u201cLet the bank come, let anybody come; we will not change our position. Who am I to melt these ornaments that have been given by the devotees with emotion?\u201dSome temples seem ready to experiment, though.On Tuesday, devotees were plunging forward in a crush of bodies at Shree Siddhivinayak Ganpati, thrusting offerings of flowers and sweets toward a black stone idol of the elephant-headed deity Ganesh. A woman stood facing the idol with closed eyes, lips moving, her face creased with pain. Outside, temple authorities were auctioning off donated gold jewelry to raise cash, which they said would be used for charitable purposes.Narendra Murari Rane, chairman of the temple trust, said he was waiting to see whether the government offered favorable terms to those depositing gold in banks. His temple stores 348 pounds of gold in drawers in a storeroom, behind three bulletproof iron doors, and ringed with more than 1,000 surveillance cameras and 65 security guards.\u201cWe will consider it,\u201d he said of the plan. \u201cIf the result is better than our own auctions, maybe. We can only consider it if the profits are more.\u201dHe said sustained efforts in the next few years could draw around 300 tons of gold, or the equivalent of $12 billion, into use as investable capital.The auctioneer at Shree Siddhivinayak Ganpati temple, who kicked off bidding with a cry of \u201cLong live Ganesh,\u201d noted that the donations to the deity were, for the most part, transactional from the get-go, since most of the temple\u2019s donors make offerings to hold up their end of a bargain with the deity.\u201cThey ask for a wish from God,\u201d said the auctioneer, Shashikant Kanvilkar. \u201cThat\u2019s the moment when they tell God, \u2018If my wish comes through, I will give you this particular thing.\u2019 This temple is known to make your wishes come true. The gift is given after the deal is completed.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about India\u2019s plans to use privately owned gold for trade and investment misspelled the given name of India\u2019s minister of state for finance.

{"Headline": "Campaign Casts Hillary Clinton as the Populist It Insists She Has Always Been", "Date": "2015-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor anyone who wondered what kind of economic message Mrs. Clinton would deliver in her campaign, the first few days made it clear: She is embracing the ideas trumpeted by Ms. Warren and the populist movement \u2014 that the wealthy have been benefiting disproportionately from the economy while the middle class and the poor have been left behind. And the policies Mrs. Clinton is advancing, like paid sick leave for employees and an increase in the minimum wage, align with that emphasis.But now, the former secretary of state must persuade voters that she is the right messenger for the cause of inequality, not simply seizing on it out of political expedience.Nothing stings members of her inner circle more than the suggestion that their candidate is late to these issues. Mrs. Clinton was the original Elizabeth Warren, her advisers say, a populist fighter who for decades has been an advocate for families and children; only now have the party and primary voters caught up.\u201cI don\u2019t know why we have this semicollective amnesia about her past positions,\u201d said Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policy director in 2008. \u201cShe\u2019s following no one on these issues.\u201dIt is easy to forget that for years, Mrs. Clinton weathered criticism that she was too liberal, the socialist foil to her husband\u2019s centrist agenda. Economists in the Clinton administration referred to the first lady and her aides as \u201cthe Bolsheviks.\u201dMrs. Clinton can expect little if any opposition in the Democratic primaries. But she was similarly well positioned when she declared her candidacy in 2007.In Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, she positioned herself as the populist candidate to the left of Barack Obama on several economic issues, angering some of her Wall Street donors and earning broad support among organized labor and working-class voters.\u201cLet\u2019s finally do something about the growing economic inequality that is tearing our country apart,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said during her campaign, appearing at the Take Back America conference, a gathering of liberal groups, in June 2007. \u201cThe top 1 percent of our households,\u201d she added, \u201cheld 22 percent of our nation\u2019s wealth.\u201d\u201cEnough with the corporate welfare,\u201d she continued. \u201cEnough with the golden parachutes. And enough with the tax incentives for companies to shift jobs overseas.\u201dA 16-page dossier, titled \u201cHillary Clinton: A Lifetime Champion of Income Opportunity\u201d and assembled by a close friend and adviser to Mrs. Clinton, calls Ms. Warren a \u201cfootnote.\u201d The document, provided to The New York Times, presents 40 instances in which Mrs. Clinton took the same stance as Ms. Warren on issues \u2014 like organized labor and tax increases on the wealthy \u2014 in some cases years before the senator\u2019s ascent in the national spotlight.But that was then, and this is now, when everything Mrs. Clinton does will be viewed through the lens of a party under the influence of Ms. Warren and her blistering critique of the financial sector.Robert B. Reich, a secretary of labor during the Clinton administration who has advised Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, said the comparison with Ms. Warren \u201cpersonalizes it far too much.\u201d\u201cThis is a broad-based movement to take back our democracy and make the economy work for everybody instead of a small group at the top,\u201d he said.For seven years, Mrs. Clinton has been out of domestic policy, and in that time, the populist movement has caught fire. In the years Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state and since she left the State Department in early 2013, she has become more associated with the centrist policies of the Bill Clinton years than with policies of raising taxes on the wealthy and increasing government services that have become widely adopted on the left.\u201cThis perception comes because she wasn\u2019t involved in the discussion for so long,\u201d Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist, said of Mrs. Clinton. Because, she added, in the White House \u201cshe had this reputation as being the very left-wing, liberal, Elizabeth Warren type.\u201dDonald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention.During the same period when Mrs. Clinton was absent from domestic debates, the policies of the Bill Clinton years were recast.In her 2008 campaign, Mrs. Clinton cited the prosperity of the 1990s. Today, the trade deals, Wall Street deregulation and deficit reduction that Mr. Clinton oversaw are often blamed as contributing to the divide between a tiny sliver of the wealthiest and the vast majority of Americans.\u201cI remember when Bill Clinton was running in 1992 and his line was \u2018putting people first,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Dean Baker, an economist and a director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t follow through on that,\u201d and instead emphasized deficit reduction and trade deals, he added.\u201cThe goal is greater prosperity and security for American families, not trade for trade\u2019s sake,\u201d Mr. Merrill said in a statement.Mrs. Clinton will begin to present more specific policy proposals next month. In the meantime, she has expressed support for an increase in the minimum wage, paid family medical leave and the closing of corporate tax loopholes.In a meeting with economists this year, Mrs. Clinton intensely studied a chart that showed income inequality in the United States. The graph charted how real wages, adjusted for inflation, had increased exponentially for the wealthiest Americans, making the bar so steep it hardly fit on the chart.Mrs. Clinton pointed at the top category and said the economy required a \u201ctoppling\u201d of the wealthiest 1 percent, according to several people who were briefed on her policy discussions but could not discuss private conversations for attribution.Still, Mrs. Clinton will pitch that \u201ctoppling\u201d with a very different style from Ms. Warren, a bankruptcy expert whose populist message has been laser-focused on holding Wall Street accountable. Mrs. Clinton will present proposals for changes in the tax code as a way of also investing in education, infrastructure and communities.Mrs. Clinton \u201cwakes up asking how she can accomplish real things for families, not who she can attack,\u201d said Gene B. Sperling, an economic adviser in the Clinton and Obama administrations. He added, \u201cWhen she shows that fighting populist edge, it is for a purpose.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Veteran of the Financial Crisis Tells China to Be Wary", "Date": "2015-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookAbout 340 pages into Henry M. Paulson\u2019s new book on China, a sentence comes almost out of nowhere that stops readers in their tracks.\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s not a question of if, but when, China\u2019s financial system,\u201d he writes, \u201cwill face a reckoning and have to contend with a wave of credit losses and debt restructurings.\u201dMr. Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, knows a thing or two about financial crises, having been the lead firefighter during the 2008 financial collapse, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Mr. Paulson also knows more about China, its politics and the players behind it than most Westerners, having been the former chief executive of Goldman Sachs and one of the first businessmen to seek to establish ties with China more than two decades ago, regularly making trips to the country and befriending top officials.A crisis in China, even a small one, would be contagious, especially in the United States. Already, fears of a slowdown in China in recent months have led to jitters about the trajectory of the American economy.Mr. Paulson stresses that he\u2019s not saying a crisis is inevitable, and he believes that one can be averted if officials make the right policy decisions.But Mr. Paulson\u2019s anxieties about China have an unnerving similarity to the financial crisis in the United States, and his warnings demand attention.Like the United States crisis in 2008, Mr. Paulson worries that in China \u201cthe trigger would be a collapse in the real estate market,\u201d and he declared in an interview that China is experiencing a real estate bubble. He noted that debt as a percentage of gross domestic product in China rose to 204 percent in June 2014 from 130 percent in 2008.\u201cSlowing economic growth and rapidly rising debt levels are rarely a happy combination, and China\u2019s borrowing spree seems certain to lead to trouble,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Paulson\u2019s analysis in his book, \u201cDealing With China: An Insider Unmasks the New Economic Superpower,\u201d is all the more remarkable because he has long been a bull on China and has deep friendships with its senior leaders, who could frown upon his straightforward comments.Mr. Paulson is hopeful that the book, an eye-opening account that praises China while acknowledging the challenges, will be published there and that the government won\u2019t seek to press him to remove his critique. \u201cI have just begun discussions with a Chinese publisher,\u201d he said. \u201cI will only authorize publication if it is published completely and accurately. I am unwavering on that.\u201dMark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, just added \u201cDealing With China\u201d to his book club, an interesting choice given that Facebook is blocked in China.In the book, Mr. Paulson says he is particularly worried about China\u2019s opaque trust companies, which have nearly $2 trillion and make up a big part of the country\u2019s shadow banking system. These companies sell high-yield investments known as wealth management products and use the money to make loans to often-risky borrowers.Mr. Paulson is not the first person to sound the alarm. A Credit Suisse analyst called the trust companies a ticking \u201ctime bomb.\u201dPerhaps most unnerving is a \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d mind-set among the financial industry\u2019s senior leaders that sounds all too familiar. In their view, if a trust company were to fail, the government would come to the rescue, leading all of them to take even greater risks.\u201cOne of the biggest problems in China\u2019s banking system is the moral hazard created by the expectation that the government will always step in to prop up a failed institution and assume losses,\u201d Mr. Paulson wrote. \u201cIf the government is to discourage bad behavior on the part of market participants counting on a government bailout, it is crucial to decide clearly and decisively which institutions are systemically important and need to be supported and which creditors and investors should share in the losses.\u201dOf course, the tricky part for China\u2019s government will be picking the winners and losers. As was his approach in the United States, Mr. Paulson advocates saving certain institutions, calling it \u201can unpleasant necessity\u201d and suggesting that inside China, unlike the United States, there is \u201cthe political will to bail out failing financial institutions.\u201dAlso unlike the United States, it is not clear that the public will ever fully know the depths of a bank\u2019s problems. \u201cTransparency in China too often means the government having all the information,\u201d Mr. Paulson told me.One of the ways China has managed to artificially inflate the economy, Mr. Paulson said, is the way in which municipalities have freely spent on infrastructure. \u201cTo oversimplify it, to fund themselves, if they need money, they take someone\u2019s land and sell it to developers,\u201d he said, explaining, \u201cThey don\u2019t have the revenue to meet all their responsibilities.\u201dMr. Paulson said that with $4 trillion in reserves and an experienced financial team within China\u2019s top ranks, the situation should be \u201cmanageable\u201d if \u201cthey do not revert to the flawed municipal finance model to boost growth.\u201d He added: \u201cThe Chinese government totally understands this.\u201dBut he said, \u201cThe longer they wait to address this problem, the more costly it will become and the more likely that it will disrupt the real economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s Mixed Scorecard", "Date": "2015-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchWith Loretta E. Lynch sworn in as the new attorney general, we can look back at the legacy of Eric H. Holder Jr., who had the third-longest term in that office in American history. In the area of white-collar crime, the reaction to his leadership of the Justice Department has been mixed, with questions raised about whether too much emphasis was put on penalizing organizations at the expense of pursuing cases against individuals.Any assessment of Mr. Holder\u2019s tenure begins \u2014 and for many probably ends \u2014 with the response to the financial crisis. When he took charge of the Justice Department in early 2009, the full effects of the crisis were hitting the economy and hundreds of billions of dollars in bailouts were being funneled to leading financial institutions.Like the savings-and-loan crisis of the late 1980s and the accounting frauds that led to the demise of corporate giants like Enron and WorldCom in the early 2000s, the expectation was that a wave of prosecutions would ensue. Yet the wait continues with no prominent criminal cases filed against executives.Soon before leaving office, Mr. Holder gave federal prosecutors a 90-day deadline to pursue civil or criminal charges against individuals involved in the packaging of securities backed by subprime mortgages that faltered starting in 2007. It is unlikely that any significant criminal prosecutions will emerge because any evidence of misconduct is probably stale by now, and civil lawsuits can result only in financial penalties that may be paid by companies on behalf of executives.The first few years of Mr. Holder\u2019s term included few cases from the Justice Department that took aim at companies at the heart of the financial crisis. Prosecutors closed criminal investigations into the American International Group, Lehman Brothers and Countrywide Financial without filing charges.Mr. Holder sent a message \u2014 intended or not \u2014 that the Justice Department was not going to aggressively pursue cases involving large banks because some were just \u201ctoo big to jail.\u201d Of course, no bank can actually be jailed, but the issue was whether organizations would have to take responsibility for conduct during the financial crisis, especially when no executives were facing charges.I suspect that if Mr. Holder could get a \u201cdo-over\u201d on that frank admission, he would take it back in a heartbeat. Once it was out there, though, the Justice Department ramped up investigations into banks for their role in selling securities tied to subprime mortgages in the years before the financial crisis. This led to a wave of settlements in which billions of dollars became the starting point for negotiations. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup paid penalties that were the equivalent of a year\u2019s worth of their profits to settle cases.All of these settlements, however, came well after the financial crisis. Persuading large banks and Wall Street firms to pay record sums proved to be easy pickings for the Justice Department because no institution seemed to have the stomach to risk going to trial. In one case in which Bank of America did fight in court over a mortgage program used by Countrywide Financial before its acquisition, the bank suffered an embarrassing loss that resulted in a penalty of more than $1 billion and the negative publicity that accompanies a finding of fraud.Even when it cracked down on banks by demanding guilty pleas, the Justice Department proved rather accommodating. In settlements related to manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, and violations of the economic sanctions law, it made sure that the collateral consequences of the conviction were kept to a minimum so that a bank\u2019s ability to stay in business was not put at risk.Abuse of interest rates and the failure to address the problem is one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.Perhaps the greatest irony of the various settlements with the banks was the effect on their stock prices. They learned a lesson from the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s lawsuit in 2010 against Goldman Sachs for its sale of a collateralized debt obligation. The filing of the case took everyone by surprise, resulting in a sharp drop in the firm\u2019s share price. Afterward, word of a bank\u2019s settlement leaked out well in advance of the formal agreement, and its shares would usually rise in response because of the certainty the settlement provided to Wall Street that at least a portion of the bank\u2019s problems were behind it.Mr. Holder did oversee a number of successful white-collar prosecutions that will have a lasting effect. Cases involving economic sanctions laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and manipulation of financial benchmarks showed that prosecutors would aggressively pursue misconduct by any organization that had an effect on American companies and markets. An initiative begun before Mr. Holder\u2019s tenure to crack down on tax evasion through secret foreign accounts has continued to gain momentum, with Swiss bank secrecy almost a thing of the past.The lack of individual prosecutions related to the financial crisis and other misconduct by banks remains the sticking point in any assessment of Mr. Holder. Although a few midlevel traders have been charged in connection with Libor manipulation, no top executive has been indicted. This was in sharp contrast to the accounting fraud cases in which chief executives like Jeffrey K. Skilling of Enron and Bernard J. Ebbers of WorldCom were convicted of fraud. Despite the difficulties in prosecuting individuals, the public expectation was that at least some senior officers would be charged.Whether that shift in emphasis leads to future prosecutions of corporate executives remains to be seen. But if it does, it will be Mr. Holder\u2019s successor, Ms. Lynch, who receives the credit. His legacy in white-collar crime cases is that large financial institutions bore the brunt of federal enforcement efforts, and there will always be a suspicion \u2014 fair or not \u2014 that executives got away with something.Advertisement"}

Michael Froman, the United States trade representative, flew to Japan last week for talks. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who arrived in the United States on Sunday, is scheduled to discuss the pact in Washington and address a joint meeting of Congress. And Congress is deciding whether to give the president fast-track authority for such trade agreements, which would put a deal to a vote without allowing amendments.As the deal has come to the forefront again, the Chinese government has changed its view.Some of China\u2019s leading trade policy intellectuals now say that they have few concerns about the agreement. They also say that the pact could even help China, by making it easier for Beijing to pursue its own regional agreements without facing criticism that it should instead pursue ambitious global free trade pacts that would require significantly opening its markets to Western competition.\u201cWe don\u2019t think T.P.P. is a challenge to China \u2014 we will watch and study,\u201d said He Weiwen, a former Commerce Ministry official who is now the co-director of the China-United States-European Union Study Center in Beijing.\u201cWe are more or less neutral because we have our own agenda, pushing forward Asean plus six and the Silk Road,\u201d he said, referring to two of China\u2019s own regional initiatives. He added that China would make sure its regional pacts complied with global free trade rules on such deals.The Obama administration has been trying to strike a difficult diplomatic and legislative balance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In part, it wants to reassure Beijing that the pact is not aimed at putting Chinese trade at a disadvantage.\u201cT.P.P. is open architecture, and T.P.P. is really meant to be about setting high standards for trade \u2014 standards that aspire to be equivalent to the United States\u2019,\u201d said Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker.Yet congressional leaders say that administration officials have also been happy to portray the agreement, in private, as a geopolitical tactic to strengthen economic links with American allies in Asia like Japan.The United States and many of China\u2019s neighbors have been increasingly worried as Beijing has asserted greater authority in the region. The Japanese government, in particular, has been riled by China\u2019s stance over disputed airspace and islands. Countries like the Philippines have been alarmed that Beijing has turned semi-submerged reefs into military-grade aircraft runways in contested waters of the South China Sea.\u201cWhen the administration sells me on this, it\u2019s all geopolitics, not economics: We want to keep these countries in our orbit, not China\u2019s,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York. \u201cI agree with that. But I need to be sold on the economics.\u201dSenior Chinese officials have started to soften on the Trans-Pacific Partnership in recent months. In October, Zhu Guangyao, a vice finance minister, said that the pact would be \u201cincomplete\u201d without China, and hinted that China might want to participate someday.\u201cFor the T.P.P., frankly speaking, there have been internal debates within both the United States and the Chinese government,\u201d Mr. Zhu said during a visit to Washington. \u201cBut now our position is clear: As China becomes more open, it\u2019s very important for us to be integrated into the global trade system with a high standard.\u201dStill, the trade deal presents some potential tensions for China.The United States already has free trade agreements with half the countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. So the most important negotiations in the pact involve Japan and Vietnam, which do not have such deals.The prominence of Japan in the trade talks has made some Chinese officials and trade experts wary. Japan is China\u2019s main political and military rival in East Asia. The free trade agreement could give Japanese companies better access to the American market in large, high-tech industries that China wants to dominate, like automobile manufacturing and telecommunications.By agreeing to open up its financial sector, Vietnam would also gain an advantage in exporting to the United States in a range of low-tech goods like shoes and garments. The trade deal could accelerate the relocation of these industries from China, where blue-collar wages have quintupled in the last decade, to Vietnam, where pay has risen more slowly.The planned trade agreement \u201cis in large part a Japan story and a Vietnam story,\u201d said Peter A. Petri, a professor of international finance at Brandeis University.Others in China are suspicious of how some countries ended up participating in the T.P.P. negotiations and others did not.\u201cRight now, the T.P.P. has looped in many Southeast Asian countries, like Vietnam and Philippines, whose financial industries actually lag behind China\u2019s,\u201d said Shen Guobing, a professor at Fudan University\u2019s Institute of World Economy in Shanghai. \u201cWhen they are allowed in, yet China is not, it raises questions of a double standard.\u201dAdministration officials insist that all countries in the trade agreement will meet consistent standards of openness, and say that China made its own decision not to participate.China has its own reasons for shying away from a trans-Pacific trade deal extending from Chile to Japan.Because China joined the World Trade Organization while still clearly a developing country in 2001, it has been able to maintain high tariffs and other import restrictions. If China did participate in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it would come under pressure to remove many of its steep trade barriers.\u201cThis is obviously an American trap for China,\u201d Mr. Shen said, \u201ca threshold we can\u2019t possibly reach.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about China\u2019s evolving attitude toward the Trans-Pacific Partnership erroneously included one country among those in the proposed pact. While South Korea has asked to be part of the partnership, it has not yet joined the negotiations.Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting from Washington, and Patrick Zuo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Greece Battles a Debt Crisis, Its Banks Issue More Short-Term Debt", "Date": "2015-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA strange thing is happening as Greece struggles to avert bankruptcy: Its troubled banks are loading up on more debt.These short-term bonds, which have been issued by the country\u2019s largest banks and carry the guarantee of the Greek government, are not being sold to foreign investors. They are being issued to the only entity that would dare buy them: themselves.In the last four months, some of Greece\u2019s largest banks, including Piraeus, Alpha and Eurobank \u2014 have self-issued more than 13 billion euros\u2019 worth, or $14.3 billion, of these government-guaranteed bonds.Wounded by vanishing deposits and bad loans, Greek bank bonds are about as toxic an investment as can be found. The banks are on life support via an emergency lending program overseen by the European Central Bank, via which they have access to short-term loans from their own central bank.But to secure this credit line, about \u20ac71 billion (more than half the deposits outstanding in Greece), these banks need to provide collateral to the Greek central bank.As was the case in Cyprus during its banking crisis, when a financial system implodes, finding acceptable collateral to swap for desperately needed loans can be difficult.As long as the bank\u2019s problem is access to short-term funds and not solvency, such machinations can work. In the last year or so, Greek banks have issued more than \u20ac50 billion worth of these securities at artificially high interest rates (the higher the rate, the more valuable the collateral becomes in securing loans).Mr. Varoufakis, then a relatively unknown economist, argued that the loans were a potent risk for Greece, which would have to assume responsibility for them if the banks failed.Uncomfortable with the amounts of bonds being issued, the European Central Bank said that, as of March, it would no longer accept such paper.But there appears to be no restriction on the banks using these bonds to tap credit from their own central banks, and they have done so. The most recent case occurred Tuesday, when Piraeus, Greece\u2019s largest bank, issued a \u20ac4.5 billion note at 6 percent, which matures in July.Advertisement"}

The containers are provided by ConGlobal Industries, a partner. The company, which was started in 2007, is based in New York.  VIVIAN MARINOIf you\u2019ve ever done any development in New York, you know that the construction process is not always as predictable as you would like, and so I saw this as a way to create a sustainable alternative in the marketplace and eliminate some of the risk of site-base construction. We worked with the last administration, especially after Sandy. We actually had proposed providing 400 or 500 temporary stores in impacted areas with a private sponsor, but that never went off.We think, plus or minus, the building will be somewhere around 16,000 to 17,000 square feet. We don\u2019t make one container an apartment \u2014 maybe we\u2019ll engineer four or five to create four apartments, and we take out the side walls to facilitate that. That building will probably be one floor commercial and seven apartments, a few of which will be duplexes. We have a letter of intent signed and partnership documents are being finalized. It would be a partnership with the landowner. I\u2019m under an agreement; I can\u2019t say who.Just to note that containers are 8,000 pounds. They can hold up to 50,000 pounds of cargo. So at sea that bottom container is holding up eight of its brothers and sisters. That\u2019s 600,000 pounds of load at the dynamic forces at sea. It\u2019s a highly oxidized steel and it\u2019s engineered to be beaten up by saltwater at sea and to take a pounding.A building that would be, say, 100 percent curved wall glass on every side we would not recommend you use the containers.It\u2019s like midcentury modern architecture.

{"Headline": "In Code We Trust", "Date": "2015-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Money IssueWhen Caesar Augustus minted the denarius coin, around 4 A.D., he did so with a decree that it be made almost entirely of silver. But over the coming decades, as the financial health of the Roman Empire declined \u2014 largely because of its increasingly independent army, which demanded ever more money to subdue the rebellious provinces \u2014 the emperors began, slowly at first, mixing in copper to stretch the silver further. By 280 A.D., a denarius was 98 percent copper, with a thin silver wash on the surface. The implication was clear to every Roman: Here, in their hands, was a physical manifestation of the empire\u2019s deepening desperation. Whatever proclamations the emperor might make, the coin told the truth.The lesson, perhaps, is that money shapes \u2014 and is shaped by \u2014 the society at large. And the last century has seen far more transformation in money than any other to date. A hundred years ago, paper money was still just a reference document, the real value hidden away in a vault full of gold. But with the rise of information technology, money has increasingly become an abstraction. We\u2019ve created A.T.M. and debit and credit cards, electronic transfers and 401(k) accounts. Since 1980, computers and deregulation have allowed Wall Street firms to experiment exuberantly with new securities that blur the line between finance and gambling. By the early 2000s, banks were selling securitized mortgage-backed assets as \u201cmoney-good,\u201d and it was largely this mistaking of junk for cash that brought about the financial crisis of 2008.They do their best to hide it, but today the world\u2019s central bankers are in something like a state of panic. Money is, quite clearly, uncontrollable. This manifests in large ways \u2014 like the six years of continuous crisis that have roiled the eurozone \u2014 but also in smaller, more technical matters. For example, the Federal Reserve has no idea how much money is out there, at least in all its digital forms, or how fast the overall supply is growing. This is alarming, because the whole concept behind the Fed is to monitor and control the money supply. That was a much easier task in an era of physical banks and highly regulated savings accounts. But today, each of us has the power to increase the money supply by simply carrying a balance on a credit card. (If you ever meet a central banker and want to get her stammering, ask this question: \u201cHow much money is there, precisely?\u201d)One way to understand this chaos is to see that power is shifting. The authority to create, move and define money \u2014 once confined to central banks and treasury departments \u2014 is being dispersed to an odd mix of entrepreneurs, libertarian hackers and old-line banking institutions. Even for the most technologically skeptical, this monetary chaos isn\u2019t something we can choose to avoid. It\u2019s a new and pivotal force in our economy, and it will change the way we work and live.There is a common perception that economists believe money drives human behavior. In fact, it\u2019s almost precisely the opposite. Most modern economics is predicated on an idea first espoused by David Hume in his 1752 essay, \u201cOf Money,\u201d that currency, gold, bank slips, checks and so on are beside the point. What actually matters is what we make and do and feel and want. Money is just an imperfect tool to add it all up, to assign value to our fundamental human desires. We need money only because it, unlike passion, can be stored and traded and counted.Arguably the two greatest economists of all time \u2014 Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes \u2014 both wrote about money as a way to get at something far more important: who we human beings really are and how we can have the best possible lives. Smith believed that the core desire of all people was to be both loved and worthy of love. Keynes believed the highest possibility of human life came from creating and appreciating artistic works of true beauty. In either case, money is not some separate force, easily divided from other, more human, concerns. Money is changing now, very fast, but only because we are, too.An article on May 3 about how money shapes society misstated when Caesar Augustus minted the denarius coin. The date is not precisely known, but scholars believe that it was between 2 B.C. and A.D. 4, not around A.D. 15.Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR\u2019s \u201cPlanet Money\u201d and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Before her election to Congress, Ms. Comstock, 55, a mother and grandmother, served in the Virginia House of Delegates.Her interests are decidedly less partisan these days. She talked about the need to encourage technological innovation and empower women in an interview, which has been condensed:What moved you to run for Congress?Actually I never intended to run for any office, but Congressman Wolf called me and said, \u201cYou need to jump in and do this yourself,\u201d and I couldn\u2019t think of a reason not to. I was just really concerned about the direction of the country; the economy in 2008 was awful. My children were in college or out of school at that point, and I grew really concerned about the world they\u2019re going to be living in.For five years in the Statehouse it was really great because on the state level, you really can make things work. I passed a lot of tech legislation, worked a lot with my tech community, and I do think a lot of the technology areas are where we\u2019re going to break through a lot of the sort of the right-left divide.You got your start in politics working in Senator Kennedy\u2019s office.I was at American University in the Washington semester program, and I was raised a Democrat. I came here and was an intern for Ted Kennedy, and actually \u2014 Orrin Hatch always enjoys this story \u2014 as I went to the hearings, whether it was the health hearings or judiciary, which they both were on at that time, I realized that I agreed more with the ideas that Orrin Hatch was talking about how we deal with health care, judicial issues. And I was a Reagan Democrat probably initially.When I came here to Virginia to go to law school at Georgetown, Frank Wolf was my congressman, and I met him fairly early on in the \u201980s and really liked him. Congressman Wolf used to always say: \u201cYou wake up in the morning, you can read something in the paper and think someone needs to fix that. And you can be that someone.\u201dWhat do you think of Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s potential candidacy for the presidency?It\u2019s always good to stay in my lane on that one, and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen on the other side. It\u2019s a lifetime in an election between now and next year, so it\u2019s always wide open.Did you do your own opposition research for the past campaign? It was a close race.In my three state delegate races I knocked on over 10,000 doors each election, so that\u2019s the part that I like, because when you\u2019re actually talking to everybody, door-to-door, you honestly know what their top priorities are. As a representative and a candidate, I think that\u2019s my best role, the best way of doing things, because you get good ideas from people. You kind of cut through the clutter.What is it like to be a Republican right now, when many of the prominent figures in your party are such divisive figures?I think there are some people on both sides who are like that, whether it\u2019s Elizabeth Warren or there are others that can carry that same banner on the other side. But I started a young women\u2019s leadership program here. Obviously you want women to be experienced, and in my case, I like the Maggie Thatcher model more in terms of women leaders, but I think we need to get women leaders out there on a lot of fronts. I\u2019ve encouraged women in a lot of different areas to step up and think of themselves in leadership roles because I know in my case, when I was running, Congressman Wolf called me, and actually some other men did \u2014 but women, we often don\u2019t say that to ourselves.What will success look like for your first term?I think first and foremost that the economy is much more on track. Part of getting the economy on track is having technology work better so that things \u2014 whether it\u2019s health care or access for medicine \u2014 are working better and costing less. When I was in college, I had to make long-distance phone calls to my husband, who was in Texas, and we spent $200 a month on phone bills. Now I have a device that costs me less than that, that has the power of my computer and search tools and unlimited phone calls, and why shouldn\u2019t your government work more like that?And having more women leaders involved. Right now I\u2019m the only woman representing Virginia. I\u2019m the first woman in this seat. For the first time we\u2019re over a hundred women in Congress, but there\u2019s only been a little over 300 ever in Congress. I think since there\u2019s 10,000-something members of all time.

While celebrating the subway\u2019s popularity, they have cautioned that the aging system is struggling to keep up with the growth. The subway often handles more than six million riders a day, officials said.The authority\u2019s chairman, Thomas F.

No, the dismay here has to do with the musical itself, a turgid throwback to the British invasion of Broadway in the 1980s, and more specifically to the epic-romantic style of the Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg and Alain Boublil shows \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d and \u201cMiss Saigon.\u201dOf course, those musicals, too, have innumerable admirers. If full-throated love ballads and thundering militaristic anthems, baggy plots, highly expositional dialogue and doomed romances are your cup of tea, fire up the samovar and give the show a try. But be warned: Even as it shares similarities with those long-running hits, \u201cDoctor Zhivago\u201d is inferior in most respects to the musicals it is emulating.Lara, who has been seduced by the lawyer Victor Komarovsky (Tom Hewitt), breaks in upon the wedding celebrations of Tonia and Zhivago, and tries to kill Komarovsky. Since Komarovsky was Zhivago\u2019s father\u2019s lawyer \u2014 a rather shady one \u2014 Zhivago senses the noble motives behind Lara\u2019s rash act, and a love born in part of sympathy is awakened.As the winds of history blow them about like so many loose grains of wheat, Zhivago and Lara cross paths more than once. She turns up as a nurse with his unit at the front, having come in search of her husband, the Communist firebrand Pasha Antipov (Paul Alexander Nolan). Later they both find themselves living near each other in the Ural Mountains, Zhivago having fled Moscow with his family after the upheavals of the revolution destroy the economy and thousands of city dwellers face starvation.The lyrics by Mr. Korie and Ms. Powers are certainly the equal of those found in the aforementioned British-are-coming musicals, but let\u2019s leave it at that. I counted just one effort to brighten the continually wintry weather, when Antipov\u2019s fellow revolutionaries bestow a gag gift on him as he sets off to fight in World War I \u2014 a lush picture book of Russia\u2019s grand palaces \u2014 and sing a mocking down-with-the-czar song called \u201cIt\u2019s a Godsend.\u201d (Which ultimately ends up a love song to Lara, too.)Mr. Weller\u2019s book does a reasonable job of keeping the complicated political and social upheavals comprehensible. But there\u2019s more emphasis on the conflicted romance between Lara and Zhivago, with dialogue that might have been swiped from just about any love story of stage, page or screen. Lara to Zhivago: \u201cSay goodbye before we do something we\u2019ll both regret.\u201d Zhivago to Lara: \u201cI wonder \u2014 is it better to know happiness like this is possible.\u201d The reply: \u201cI\u2019d live my life again for this little time with you.\u201d (Bubble above my head: I\u2019d live my life again only if I could avoid musicals like this.)The minimalist sets, by Michael Scott-Mitchell, do not exactly drench us in atmosphere. A slightly raised platform scoots rather aimlessly around the stage, impersonating the trains that shuttle the characters this way and that. Presumably this is intended to add some dynamism to the show\u2019s visual impact, but the famous turntable from \u201cLes Miz\u201d it isn\u2019t.Mr. Hewitt makes the most of his semivillainous role as the opportunistic survivor Komarovsky, who changes his politics to suit the times as if simply donning a new cravat. In the title role, Mr. Mutu sings strongly and with commitment and does a decent job of communicating the divided loyalties that tear at the heart of Zhivago. But over all there\u2019s a generic quality to the characters, as written, that is probably beyond the scope of an actor to correct.I should warn the jumpy that those warnings about the sound of gunfire in the lobby and the program are meant in earnest. With a world war and a bloody national revolution to depict, \u201cDoctor Zhivago\u201d regularly rattles the rafters (and your nerves) with the sound of explosions and gunshots. The cynic in me wondered whether all this artillery was a dramatic choice, to inject notes of harsh realism as a corrective to all the swooning romanticism, or a practical one, to keep the audience from nodding off, and Broadway wags from dubbing the show \u201cDoctor Zzzzhivago.\u201d Oops.

From its shores, the water shimmers and sparkles, a mirage that local farmers can see but not touch.\u201cWe can\u2019t use it,\u201d said Cheng Lin, a 68-year-old farmer who, like others here, plants corn once a year and hopes for spring rain. \u201cIt\u2019s for others, not us.\u201dInstead, the water is earmarked for the greater Beijing area to the south, and in the winter, increasingly, for making snow.China, which has been constructing a tourism belt around Beijing centered on water-intensive sports like skiing, is now building ski slopes in a bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympics.\u201cAs there are abundant water resources near the ski resorts, and the melted snow will be recycled,\u201d the bid says, \u201csnow-making during the Games will not have any negative impact on the local ecosystem.\u201d\u201cAbundant\u201d is not a word often used to describe Beijing\u2019s water supply. Although some parts of the city receive up to 23 inches of rain a year, the mountainous area where the ski resorts are being built and the Games would be held receives 15 to 16 inches, making it semiarid.\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t snow in Beijing,\u201d said Zhang Junfeng, an independent water expert who has written and published widely on Beijing\u2019s water troubles. \u201cPeople get ideas by watching television and sports and think it\u2019s a great pastime, but it\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d\u201cOf course they shouldn\u2019t have ski resorts,\u201d said Hu Kanping, a retired hydrologist who writes reports for the Chinese nongovernmental organization Friends of Nature. In a 2011 report, he wrote that the 11 ski resorts then open in Beijing used an average of about a billion gallons of water a year, or enough for 42,000 people.Beijing has proposed the Chongli area for events like snowboarding, freestyle skiing and cross-country skiing. Chongli already has several ski slopes, but at least one other Olympic ski run and a sledding run are under construction. One of the larger ski resorts that had closed has reopened, and another is set to expand if Beijing wins the Games.Yanqing Songshan National Forest Park, which has the only substantial mountain near Beijing, was chosen for Alpine skiing, which requires longer runs and steeper descents. Yanqing has no existing ski slopes.Beijing and Chongli officials did not respond to repeated requests for interviews.\u201cThis kind of development is a Martian-like plan,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely artificial.\u201dAnother concern for conservationists is that both Beijing and Almaty plan to build Olympic ski resorts in their national parks. Beijing\u2019s organizers are planning to use Xiaohaituo Mountain in Yanqing National Park for the Alpine events. The mountain is part of a protected nature reserve, and automobile traffic is banned. Officials have said construction will begin there only if Beijing wins the bid.Studies show that ski runs increase erosion and destroy plant life beyond simply the growth that is cut down; they can also cause permanent damage to topsoil and plants beneath the surface. Artificial snow worsens this problem because it often creates an ice sheet over the ground, leading to the growth of mold underneath.During a visit in February, the Haituoshan mountain range had no snow at all. Locals said that water for artificial snow would come from the nearby Guanting Reservoir.Zeng Lian, a local farmer, said he hoped Beijing would win the bid. \u201cThe leaders have been here several times, and if Beijing wins, we can develop,\u201d he said.A ski resort would provide revenue for his village, Haituo, long after the Games ended, he said. Most residents live off corn farming, herding and selling supplies to hikers.The planned investment is huge. For the Xiaohaituo area, the government would invest $163 million, including for a 35-acre Olympic Village and 940 hotel rooms.In nearby Chongli, the investment is less \u2014 $95 million \u2014 because some facilities already exist, such as the Genting Grand Secret Garden, a Malaysian-owned resort that would host some of the Nordic events.On the nearby slopes, skiers seemed excited about the prospect of hosting the Games.\u201cThis will complete the other facilities and boost tourism,\u201d said Li Yun, a resident of Zhangjiakou who drove up for the day with his family. \u201cThe snow parks will become better and attract tourists from in and outside China.\u201dAll of the snow parks in Chongli use artificial snow. During a visit in February, the ground next to the ski runs was dry and the nearby hills were brown, except for an occasional dusting of snow in shaded areas.Artificial or not, the new industries have brought relatively good-paying jobs to the area. Service personnel can earn about $500 a month, compared with the subsistence-level farming that existed before. Until the resorts began opening over the past decade, Chongli was officially designated an impoverished county.The viability of this economy is open to debate. One of Chongli\u2019s ski resorts, Duolemeidi, closed two years ago. Resort officials rejected requests for interviews, but locals said rising water prices had made snow-making too expensive. The resort reopened recently in the hopes that Beijing wins the Games.For those without jobs in the ski tourism industry, the prospects are daunting. Mr. Cheng, the farmer near the Yunzhou Reservoir, said agriculture was increasingly difficult because climate change had reduced rainfall.Pumping water out of the ground is also becoming harder, he said. Studies show that Beijing\u2019s water table has been sinking up to two feet a year.\u201cThis is the way it has always been,\u201d Mr. Cheng said. \u201cThe water goes to the city people.\u201dAnd yet, like almost everyone interviewed in this area, he thought it would be great if Beijing won the bid.\u201cRight now, I\u2019ve only seen skiing on television,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we win, I\u2019ll take a bus down to Chongli and see the snow myself.\u201dSarah Li and Patrick Zuo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New China-Led Bank Pledges to Fend Off Graft", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySINGAPORE \u2014 China\u2019s new development bank will strive to be corruption free, maintain environmentally sound policies and work with a streamlined bureaucracy, the interim head of the institution, Jin Liqun, said on Saturday. \u201cWe are committed to building a lean, clean and green bank,\u201d Mr. Jin told the Singapore Forum, a gathering of Asian business and political leaders. The bank, known as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, will be run by a \u201ccore group of professionals,\u201d and the top management will be appointed according to ability, not political connections, he said. There will be \u201czero tolerance\u201d of corruption, he said. Mr. Jin, who did much of the negotiating that attracted 46 countries, including Britain, Germany, Australia and South Korea, as founding members of the new bank, went out of his way to persuade his audience that China will not dominate it. \u201cLeadership is not a privilege,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s an obligation.\u201d The bank, first proposed by President Xi Jinping of China in 2013 and expected to have starting capital of $100 billion, is intended as a way to build badly needed railways, roads and pipelines in underdeveloped areas of Asia. The United States declined to become a member, and as China invited countries to sign up, the Obama administration advised its allies not to join on the grounds that the new institution would undermine the World Bank, led by the United States, and the Asian Development Bank, dominated by Japan. After some of Washington\u2019s closest friends, including Britain and Australia, ignored that advice, the administration amended its opposition, saying it would encourage the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to cooperate with the new institution provided its projects meet certain standards of transparency and governance. Fourteen of the advanced economies in the Group of 20 industrialized nations have become founding members. The bank is expected to start operations at the end of the year, and as it gears up, some founding members, including Australia, say they will press China hard to ensure that it adopts transparent rules. How the new institution will withstand pressure from interest groups in China, particularly large state-owned enterprises that are expected to push for contracts to work on the infrastructure projects, is a major question for officials from some of the founding countries. Mr. Jin sought to allay those concerns at the gathering here, stressing that the new bank, with so many major countries as members, was a multilateral institution. \u201cChina is just a leading member,\u201d he said. China, based on its gross domestic product, will be the biggest shareholder, but as new members join, China\u2019s shares will diminish, he said. The bank will have its headquarters in Beijing, in the city\u2019s financial district. Still, a former minister of trade for Indonesia, Mari Pangestu, whose country is a member of the bank, asked Mr. Jin on Saturday how the bank would meet demands for environmental and social standards, given what she called the \u201cmixed\u201d results of China\u2019s investments in developing countries. The new bank will ensure that people displaced by new infrastructure projects will be taken care of, Mr. Jin replied. Local communities and countries interested in projects financed by the bank will have the opportunity to be involved from the projects\u2019 early stages and have a say through their \u201cfull life cycle,\u201d he said. Implicit in Mr. Jin\u2019s pledge to make a \u201clean, clean and green\u201d bank was a contrast with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which were founded as part of the international economic architecture after World War II, dominated by the United States. Critics have assailed both banks as large bureaucracies whose staff members are often appointed on the political whims of member states. Despite the problems in the existing institutions, there is still a lot to learn from them, Mr. Jin said. A former vice minister of finance in Beijing who held a senior position at the Asian Development Bank in Manila, he said that the World Bank had already begun to help the infrastructure bank, sending experts to consult on environmental and other standards.And the United States, he said, is \u201calways welcome to come into the kitchen\u201d and help make the new institution.

{"Headline": "If Algorithms Know All, How Much Should Humans Help?", "Date": "2015-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig DataArmies of the finest minds in computer science have dedicated themselves to improving the odds of making a sale. The Internet-era abundance of data and clever software has opened the door to tailored marketing, targeted advertising and personalized product recommendations.Shake your head if you like, but that\u2019s no small thing. Just look at the technology-driven shake-up in the advertising, media and retail industries.This automated decision-making is designed to take the human out of the equation, but it is an all-too-human impulse to want someone looking over the result spewed out of the computer. Many data quants see marketing as a low-risk \u2014 and, yes, lucrative \u2014 petri dish in which to hone the tools of an emerging science. \u201cWhat happens if my algorithm is wrong? Someone sees the wrong ad,\u201d said Claudia Perlich, a data scientist who works for an ad-targeting start-up. \u201cWhat\u2019s the harm? It\u2019s not a false positive for breast cancer.\u201dBut the stakes are rising as the methods and mind-set of data science spread across the economy and society. Big companies and start-ups are beginning to use the technology in decisions like medical diagnosis, crime prevention and loan approvals. The application of data science to such fields raises questions of when close human supervision of an algorithm\u2019s results is needed.Take consumer lending, a market with several big data start-ups. Its methods amount to a digital-age twist on the most basic tenet of banking: Know your customer. By harvesting data sources like social network connections, or even by looking at how an applicant fills out online forms, the new data lenders say they can know borrowers as never before, and more accurately predict whether they will repay than they could have by simply looking at a person\u2019s credit history.The promise is more efficient loan underwriting and pricing, saving millions of people billions of dollars. But big data lending depends on software algorithms poring through mountains of data, learning as they go. It is a highly complex, automated system \u2014 and even enthusiasts have qualms.\u201cA decision is made about you, and you have no idea why it was done,\u201d said Rajeev Date, an investor in data-science lenders and a former deputy director of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cThat is disquieting.\u201dThe concern is similar in other fields. Since its Watson computer beat human \u201cJeopardy\u201d champions four years ago, IBM has taken its data-driven artificial intelligence technology well beyond brainy games. Health care has been a major initiative. The history of \u201cexpert\u201d decision-support technology in medicine has been disappointing; the systems have not been smart or fast enough to really help doctors in day-to-day practice.But IBM scientists in collaboration with researchers at leading medical groups \u2014 including the Cleveland Clinic, the Mayo Clinic and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center \u2014 are making progress. Watson can read through medical documents at a pace incomprehensible to humans: many thousands per second, searching for clues, correlations and insights.The software has been used to help train medical students and is starting to be deployed in clinical settings in oncology, offering diagnostic and treatment recommendations as a kind of quick-witted digital assistant.IBM has also developed a software program called Watson Paths, which is a visual tool that allows a doctor to see the underlying evidence and inference paths Watson took in making a recommendation.\u201cIt\u2019s not sufficient to give a black-box answer,\u201d said Eric Brown, IBM\u2019s director of Watson technologies.Watson Paths points to the need for some machine-to-man translation as data science advances. As Danny Hillis, an artificial intelligence expert, put it, \u201cThe key thing that will make it work and make it acceptable to society is story telling.\u201d Not so much literal story telling, but more an understandable audit trail that explains how an automated decision was made. \u201cHow does it relate to us?\u201d Mr. Hillis said. \u201cHow much of this decision is the machine and how much is human?\u201dKeeping a human in the loop is one approach. The new data-science lenders are animated by data and software. But one of the start-ups in San Francisco, Earnest, has at least one of its staff members review the predictive recommendations of its software, even if the algorithms are rarely overruled. \u201cWe think the human element will always be an important piece in our process to make sure we\u2019re getting it right,\u201d said Louis Beryl, co-founder and chief executive of Earnest.But such a stance, others say, amounts to a comforting illusion \u2014 good marketing perhaps, but not necessarily good data science. Giving a person veto power in algorithmic systems, they say, introduces human bias. The promise of big data decision-making, after all, is that decisions based on data and analysis \u2014 more science, less gut feel and rule of thumb \u2014 will yield better outcomes.Yet even if optimism is justified, there is a serious challenge, given the complexity and opacity of data science. Will a technology that promises large benefits on average sufficiently protect the individual from a mysterious and wayward decision that might have a lasting effect on a person\u2019s life?One solution, according to Gary King, director of Harvard\u2019s Institute for Quantitative Social Science, may be for the human creators of the scoring algorithms to tweak them not so much for maximum efficiency or profit but to give somewhat greater weight to the individual, reducing the risk of getting it wrong.In banking, for example, an algorithm might be tuned to reduce the probability of misclassifying a loan applicant as a deadbeat, even if the trade-off is a few more delinquent loans for the lender.\u201cThe goal,\u201d Mr. King said, \u201cis not necessarily to have a human look at the outcome afterwards, but to improve the quality of the classification for the individual.\u201dIn a sense, a math model is the equivalent of a metaphor, a descriptive simplification. It usefully distills, but it also somewhat distorts. So at times, a human helper can provide that dose of nuanced data that escapes the algorithmic automaton. \u201cOften, the two can be way better than the algorithm alone,\u201d Mr. King said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bernanke Says Global Imbalances Bedevil the World Economy. Discuss.", "Date": "2015-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAsk NicelyMr. Bernanke says a \u201cglobal savings glut,\u201d caused by people and governments overseas saving too much, has driven unemployment up in the United States, and driven wages, G.D.P. and interest rates down. The mechanisms are complicated, but one of the main reasons imbalances matter is that any country that\u2019s saving too much is not buying enough American exports.This is a cheerier story than Mr. Summers\u2019s \u201csecular stagnation.\u201d Because if we fix the imbalances \u2014 get other countries to stop saving so much and start buying more of our products and borrowing more of our money \u2014 the American economy should more or less return to normal.But is there a good way for American policy makers to fix imbalances that arise abroad? \u201cWe don\u2019t really have powerful tools,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said Monday in response to a question from The New York Times.Mr. Bernanke offers plausible reasons for rejecting this approach. Other countries would be unlikely to agree to such provisions. It\u2019s not clear you could develop treaty rules that effectively distinguish between currency manipulation and valid monetary policy activity. Most important, some currency-weakening policies are actually good for the global economy, especially if the country with the weakening currency has a weak economy (think Abenomics in Japan). An international regimen that cracks down on weak-currency policies could therefore, in some cases, make global imbalances worse.But if not currency provisions in trade agreements, then what? \u201cObviously, there\u2019s not a real legal stick to use,\u201d he said, \u201cbut countries do respond I think to diplomatic overtures and to pressure from their trading partners when what they\u2019re doing is perceived as, you know, counterproductive to the global economy.\u201dThat is, ask nicely.The best example of the Ask Nicely strategy is China, whose weak currency policy was one of the leading sources of global trade imbalance over the last 20 years. In recent years, the Chinese have allowed their currency to appreciate. Perhaps they did this because of pressure from America and other trade partners; perhaps because the weak renminbi, great though it was for Chinese manufacturers, was suppressing Chinese domestic consumption and reducing real income for the country\u2019s citizens.Either way, China\u2019s policy persisted for an awfully long time and caused significant problems in the American economy. China exchanged products for American dollars. Instead of buying American products with those piles of dollars, it plowed a lot of them into American securities, including Treasury bonds. Strong foreign demand for American debt led to the strange situation from 2004 through 2007 when the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates but could not get long rates to move; this kept mortgage rates low and helped fuel the housing bubble.The American trade deficit exceeded 6 percent of G.D.P. by 2006; the United States was able to maintain a decent labor market despite the trade deficit and expensive oil only because of the housing bubble. Then, the housing bubble burst. All of which is to say, it would have been nice if the Chinese had acted sooner.Today\u2019s main sources of imbalance don\u2019t offer much hope for the Ask Nicely strategy. The other emerging Asian economies have continued to grow their trade surpluses even as China\u2019s shrinks. Their actions are understandable: The currency crises of the 1990s caused a lot of economic pain in places like South Korea, and they have since sought to accumulate enormous amounts of foreign reserves so they never have to be at the mercy of the International Monetary Fund again. But that requires spending a lot of their excess income on American bonds instead of American products.The other new source of economic imbalance is Europe. If European countries still had their own currencies, Germany would have a Deutschmark that is stronger than today\u2019s euro, and places like Spain and Italy would have weak currencies. In the real world, Germany\u2019s too-weak currency has led it to run a huge trade surplus. Southern Europe\u2019s too-strong currency should lead it to run a trade deficit, but it can\u2019t because it\u2019s in a horrible, semipermanent depression, which forces its residents to save instead of buying.When you combine those effects, you find the eurozone as a whole is now running a big trade surplus; the question is how long that will persist.\u201cWhen the European periphery returns to growth, which presumably will happen at some point, the collective surplus ought to decline,\u201d Mr. Bernanke wrote Wednesday on his blog. If we need to wait for southern Europe to get its act together for the global economy to get back into balance, we may be waiting for a very, very long time.Perhaps, in addition to looking for sticks like trade pact provisions, and instead of hoping we can talk Europe into not being a basket case anymore, policy makers could be looking for carrots. Maybe the road to global rebalancing doesn\u2019t run through China or Europe but through countries that got burned in the 1990s currency crises, many of which have been motivated to run large current account surpluses and avoid borrowing.The global situation today, in which developing countries are net savers and rich countries are net borrowers, is backward. Rich countries have lots of money, and developing countries have lots of investment opportunities. In a healthy global economy, capital should be flowing from the former to the latter, as it did before the mid-1990s. Perhaps the question we ought to be asking: What can we do to make developing countries unafraid to borrow from us again, so American exports can find markets and American capital can find better investment opportunities abroad?Advertisement"}

That\u2019s the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), currently being pushed by the Obama administration and its corporate (and mostly Republican!) allies. It\u2019s a blatant attack on labor, farmers, food safety, public health and even national sovereignty.The TPP is little more than enhanced corporation power branded as free trade. It gives corporations the right to challenge government regulations and seek compensation if they think they\u2019ve been treated unfairly by any of the 12 Pacific Rim nations in the deal. (China is currently, but not necessarily permanently, excluded; part of the thinking behind the TPP is to lock up an agreement with these partners before China does.)Even if you look \u201conly\u201d at food and the environment, the TPP should be ripped apart and put back together with public and congressional input. The pact would threaten local food, diminish labeling laws, likely keep environmentally destructive industrial meat production high (despite the fact that as a nation we\u2019re eating less meat) and probably maintain high yields of commodity crops while causing price cuts.Historically, trade laws were geared to enrich the \u201cmother\u201d country \u2014 look at the 19th-century Opium Wars in China, which forced open illegal markets so Britain and its allies could benefit. Between World War II and the 1990s, free trade arguably benefited the economies of the countries involved. But the new laws, starting with 1994\u2019s North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), recognized that capital is now mobile \u2014 it doesn\u2019t \u201clive\u201d anywhere \u2014 and owes no allegiance to any flag; only shareholders matter.Nafta is the paradigm of what are most accurately called deregulation deals. It promised better jobs in both the United States and Mexico. Instead, as well-paid workers in the United States were losing jobs to worse-paid workers in Mexico, badly paid Mexican workers were losing jobs to worse-paid workers in China, which in turn put more pressure on workers in the United States.All of which is making for some very odd alliances and demonstrating that \u201cfar right\u201d and \u201cfar left\u201d labels are increasingly useless. That\u2019s because this is a struggle between transnational corporations and just about everyone else.That\u2019s the good news: The opposition to fast-tracking appears strong. As Patrick Woodall, a senior policy advocate for Food & Water Watch, said to me, \u201cThe forces pushing fast-track are huge, but there is unbelievable public opposition, and at this point the wind is at our back.\u201dBut even to have a shot, fast-track must be defeated, and a solid debate must be opened among well-informed representatives, with plenty of public input. More exploitation of labor, fewer public health regulations, more facile production of useless goods and bad food \u2014 that is not the direction the global economy needs to go.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Married, With Roommates", "Date": "2015-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiving with roommates is practically a rite of passage in New York City. It often begins with far too many people sharing too little space and ends with a move into an apartment of one\u2019s own, or with that special someone. But with rents reaching new highs, single 20-somethings are not the only ones looking for someone with whom to share the rent. Couples are living with roommates even after they\u2019ve tied the knot. Sure, it may sound like the makings of a reality TV show. And there are plenty of ways to cut housing costs other than taking on a roommate. But couples like Mr. Jupiter and Ms. Pi\u00f1eiro say they would rather relinquish a spare room than contend with an extra-long commute, a smaller place or a less desirable area. \u201cThis is the time, really,\u201d said Mr. Jupiter, a freelance production supervisor and producer. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s important for us to save our money.\u201d How many couples have decided that three \u2014 or four \u2014 is not a crowd is impossible to say. One of the few measures is a snapshot taken by SpareRoom.com. Of the 1,076 ads offering rooms for rent in New York City on the site last month, one in five indicated that couples were welcome, said Matt Hutchinson, a spokesman. And one in 10 of the 1,632 \u201croom wanted\u201d ads were posted by couples. \u201cAffordability is the story of the moment,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said. \u201cSky-high rents mean having your own place as a couple isn\u2019t always an option.\u201dMr. Jupiter met Ms. Pi\u00f1eiro, a writer and translator, in Spain last year. She moved to New York in August and they were married in October. Their ad, posted in February, caught the eye of Joey Close, 28, a credit reporter for a financial magazine start-up based in Britain. \u201cThe fact that they were a married couple around my age was a bonus,\u201d said Mr. Close, who moved in last month and pays $800 a month, which covers half the rent and a flat fee for utilities. \u201cI figured there would be less chance of them splitting up and then having troubles with their part of the rent,\u201d Mr. Close said. Plus, he added, \u201cMy girlfriend is very happy with me sharing with a married couple rather than single guys who will want to go and meet girls.\u201dFrom the point of view of couples, the cash collected from a roommate can outweigh the trade-offs as rents in the city continue to rise. The median monthly rent in March in Manhattan was $3,395, up 6.1 percent over the same period in 2014, the second highest level reached in more than seven years, according to the appraiser Jonathan J. Miller in a report for Douglas Elliman. And renters aren\u2019t finding much relief in Brooklyn or Queens, where rents have been increasing for some time.Hefty rents make it difficult to save for a house, and tight credit has turned securing a mortgage into an obstacle course. Too few listings are pushing up the price of starter apartments.\u201cCouples with dual incomes that in any other market would be able to buy are not only finding it challenging, but they have to compromise,\u201d said Sydney Blumstein, an associate broker at the Corcoran Group, noting that several of her friends are living with their parents to save money.Ms. Blumstein has been working to help Harjinder Gill and Raj Veluvolu, young doctors who were married last year, find a place of their own. They currently share a three-bedroom in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, with two roommates. Their path to this living arrangement started with Dr. Veluvolu living with Travis Meyer, 31, a colleague. When Dr. Veluvolu became engaged to Dr. Gill, she moved into the apartment. They were all medical residents at the time.They paid roughly $900 a month apiece, with the couple using the empty bedroom as a study. Given their hectic schedules, which often include night shifts, \u201cthe three of us were actually not all home at the same time that often,\u201d Dr. Meyer said. When they were, they could retreat to their bedrooms on opposite sides of the apartment if they wanted some privacy. More often they would hang out together, sharing meals and watching TV.Dr. Veluvolu and Dr. Gill started looking for a place of their own after their wedding. But once they had crunched the numbers and toured open houses, they realized they couldn\u2019t afford one. \u201cRealistically, we don\u2019t have the down payment to even come close to buying something,\u201d said Dr. Veluvolu, 32, a chief resident at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center. And for a one-bedroom rental in the same neighborhood, he said, \u201cwe\u2019d have to spend an additional $1,000\u201d a month. So, for now at least, the couple have decided to continue apartment-sharing until they can find something they can afford. Last month, another person joined the mix: Dr. Meyer\u2019s boyfriend.\u201cIf we were living in any other city,\u201d said Dr. Gill, 30, an attending physician at SUNY Downstate, \u201cthe situation would not exist: a married couple living with a roommate and his boyfriend. It\u2019s New York City.\u201dWhen Dr. Veluvolu and Dr. Gill eventually do move out, Dr. Meyer and his boyfriend plan to take over their space and rent out the spare room. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just keeping up the tradition,\u201d he said. As with any roommate situation, tact is required in these households. A few weeks ago, for example, Dr. Veluvolu and Dr. Gill were celebrating their one-year wedding anniversary when Dr. Meyer and his partner came home. \u201cThey had a bottle of Champagne and Raj was making dinner for Harj and there were flowers on the table,\u201d Dr. Meyer said. He and his boyfriend quickly retreated to their bedroom and ordered pizza. \u201cWe said, \u2018Let them have their moment.\u2019\u00a0\u201d And Dr. Gill said she reveled in the time the couple had to themselves when their roommate was on vacation. \u201cIt does take away from intimacy,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he\u2019s not there it makes a big difference. We can be more like a couple.\u201d\u201cWe can walk around naked more often,\u201d Dr. Veluvolu chimed in.The way Gregg Anderson and Peter Talley look at it, renting out the spare room in their two-bedroom, one-bath apartment is plain old common sense. \u201cRealistically we could afford to live here by ourselves,\u201d said Mr. Anderson, 46, a corporate meeting planner and freelance interior decorator. But the extra cash they receive each month has allowed them to buy a piece of property in Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s like a part-time job,\u201d he said. The couple married in 2011 and decided to take on their first roommate nearly three years ago when they moved from a one-bedroom rental in a Hell\u2019s Kitchen luxury building to a two-bedroom on a higher floor. Since then, they have had four roommates, including two who worked at the United Nations and needed a place to stay for several months. \u201cWe do get flak from friends and family,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cI say, \u2018Do the math.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The couple charge just under $2,000 a month for the spare room, or a little less than half the rent. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money to say no to for an extra bedroom.\u201d It doesn\u2019t hurt that they are often not at home. Mr. Anderson travels frequently for his job. Mr. Talley, 37, works long hours as a software engineer for a financial firm in Midtown Manhattan. \u201cIn this small space, we can go a week without seeing a roommate,\u201d Mr. Anderson said.Still, having an extra person around is not always ideal, he said, like \u201cwhen you\u2019re in a hurry and waiting for the bathroom\u201d or when their roommate has a friend who wants to visit for two weeks. While married couples say the decision to share digs with a roommate is primarily financial, a variety of factors may be influencing the greater openness to communal living, from rental buildings with amenity spaces that give residents elbow room outside of their small apartments to the rise of the sharing economy. Lindsay Shields, 33, a high school drama teacher, lives with her husband and a roommate in a two-bedroom two-bath apartment in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. \u201cThe idea is, you get married you have your own place,\u201d she said. \u201cI think our society is finding more ways to share and because the economy is what it is, people are realizing it\u2019s just not possible to do that anymore. Space has become a commodity.\u201d Ms. Shields and her husband moved in together soon after they began dating in 2007. They married in 2012 and have had roommates practically the entire time. \u201cThere was one year in our relationship we didn\u2019t have any roommates, and it was just so quiet,\u201d she said. Living with roommates is \u201cmuch more cost effective,\u201d she added. \u201cWe live together well with other people, so we might as well share the space.\u201dHaving lived with roommates for so long, mostly students attending nearby Pratt Institute, Ms. Shields has developed some guidelines for peaceful coexistence. In the kitchen, each household member has a refrigerator shelf, cabinet space and two pantry shelves. \u201cWe\u2019ve had roommates before who are big cooks and those that are takeout-friendly. We do not take their shelves even if they don\u2019t use them,\u201d she said. If anyone plans to have more than four guests over at a time, he or she must give the other roommates a heads-up. \u201cWe also have found it easier to keep things to a flat fee,\u201d she said, noting that dividing up utility bills, Internet, cable and other fees can be \u201cexhausting and tedious.\u201dFor some couples, communal living is a lifestyle. In 2005, with the help of her family, Michelle Higa Fox, 34, purchased a two-family house on Powers Street in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and invited five friends to split the rent. The roommates included her best friend from seventh grade and two college classmates with whom she ended up founding an animation studio. \u201cFor me, it was very natural to always have people around,\u201d said Mrs. Fox, who grew up with her parents and a younger brother in a house shared with an aunt, a grandmother and, at one point, a few cousins. \u201cThere was always someone home to talk to.\u201d In 2007 she met the man who later became her husband, Stuart Higa Fox, 32, a writer. Eight months later, he moved into the PowerHouse, as the roommates refer to it. For a few years the couple shared the upstairs two-bedroom apartment with a roommate. They eventually moved downstairs to a slightly larger space, also shared with a roommate. In 2012, they tied the knot. Mrs. Fox jokes that if common-law marriage were recognized in New York, she would have been the common-law wife of a good friend, Nate, who lived at the house from 2005 until 2013. \u201cSo, even though Stuart and I have been together for seven and half years and married for two and half,\u201d Mrs. Fox said, \u201che still hasn\u2019t beat out Nate\u2019s record of living with me for eight years.\u201d Over the last decade, that sense of humor, along with an open-door policy, has fostered a familial atmosphere at the PowerHouse, with people coming and going freely among the four floors. Roommates have attended each other\u2019s dinner parties, hosted an annual backyard pig roast together and showered attention on Merlin, Mrs. Fox\u2019s affable corgi, who wanders into the bedroom of his choice on any given morning. If someone moved out, a friend of a friend stepped in to fill the void. \u201cHaving that sense of community has been a huge benefit living in the city,\u201d said Theodore Przybyla, 32, who works in the philanthropic sector and has lived with the Foxes since 2009, at first sharing the upstairs apartment with them. As in any family, there are occasional quarrels. Mr. Przybyla said there have been times when \u201cyou could cut the tension with a knife.\u201d There have also been days when he would have liked Mr. Fox to wear more clothes. \u201cAt the beginning, Stuart was freelancing. He was in a robe all day, every day. I\u2019d be getting ready for work, putting on a shirt and tie and he\u2019d be eating a bowl of cereal in his robe.\u201d For their part, said Mr. Fox, \u201cI would have liked to have more sex on the couch, but we ended up saving on our cable bill.\u201d \u201cI usually go with the kitchen,\u201d Mrs. Fox chimed in.Joking aside, Mr. and Mrs. Fox said, they would not have traded the experience for anything. In fact, with the help of Mark Martov, a salesman at Corcoran, they just bought a two-family house in Bushwick, Brooklyn, with a former roommate \u2014 Mrs. Fox\u2019s best friend from seventh grade. The couple plan to rent out the PowerHouse. And when they move with her friend to their new place, she said, \u201cI do envision still doing family dinner and Sunday TV together.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Koreans and Adultery", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 There\u2019s good news in South Korea: One of the country\u2019s favorite actresses may return to the spotlight after a six-year absence. Unlike many entertainers who take time away for rehab or spiritual regeneration, Ok So-ri, a celebrated actress of the 1990s and the former host of the popular radio show \u201c11 O\u2019clock, I Am Ok So-ri,\u201d left the country and abandoned her career to stay out of jail. In 2008 she was sentenced to eight months in prison after the actor Park Chul, who was then her husband, accused her of adultery. Now she is poised to come back home.In February, South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court overturned the 62-year-old law that made adultery illegal. While enforcement has relaxed in recent years, about 53,000 people have been charged with adultery since 1985, the year the government started keeping track. If found guilty, the penalty could include jail time of up to two years, although it had become rare for convicted adulterers to serve time.The ruling reflects the slow shift in South Korea from privileging traditional Asian values over individual rights and freedoms. The majority opinion in the 7-2 vote said, \u201cIt should be left to the free will and love of people to decide whether to maintain marriage, and the matter should not be externally forced through a criminal code.\u201dThough the decriminalization of adultery is a step forward for personal rights, most of the South Korean public does not see it that way. One poll conducted after the verdict by the newspaper Chosun Ilbo found that almost 65 percent of respondents were against the judgment. Another poll last year found that 60 percent supported the criminalization of adultery.The law continued to have so much support and persisted for so long because South Korea is still a deeply conservative country. Its backers liked to think it kept traditional family life intact by discouraging divorce through reining in the desires of wayward men. But the law only calcified women\u2019s inferior standing.Adultery was criminalized in 1953 to protect women at a time when they had a much lower status than men and were mostly confined to domestic roles. Opportunities to enter the work force were extremely limited, and most women were economically dependent on their husbands, who in the 1950s could easily get divorced and remarry with no stigma. Back then, divorced South Korean women were seen as disgraced; finding employment and remarrying were very difficult.The adultery law was seen as a safeguard for women against divorce. It empowered women because they could hold the threat of legal action over philandering husbands. It was a tool to keep their men from divorcing them.Yet that power only got them so far. Sure, women might be able to prevent a cheating spouse from divorcing them, and thus avoid the social disgrace and harsh economic reality that came with the separation. But they still had to live with an undesirable husband \u2014 and sometimes they would do so for decades. The stigma attached to divorced women remained.Real social reform would go beyond the adultery law and address the sexism that permeates South Korean society. Instead of lamenting the loss of an outdated adultery law, we should be fighting for full equality for women.Women still have far fewer opportunities for social advancement than men: There are entire sectors of the economy completely absent of women. Women who do enter major companies usually face a low glass ceiling. In 2013 the average salary for women was almost 40 percent lower than the average salary for men. And although the president of South Korea is a woman, only 16 percent of members of Parliament are female.Employers need to abandon the prejudice they have against hiring young women for fear they will get pregnant. Anti-discrimination laws should be put in place so that companies discontinue sexist hiring practices. Simultaneously, in order to alter the conservative male-oriented work culture, popular forms of media should focus on providing more examples of independent, successful women. Right now, women in fiction are almost always portrayed within the sphere of domestic space, completely dependent on men.There is a fear in South Korea that without the law, adultery will become more common and the population will become hypersexualized. Yet for all the wishful thinking of conservatives, the realities of the modern world have been intervening for some time: South Korea\u2019s divorce rate has skyrocketed in the last 15 years and is now among the highest in Asia.Ok So-ri might stage a comeback, but traditionalists have little to worry about. As long as women are second-class citizens, as long as they face inequality in the workplace, they will continue to fulfill traditional roles within the family. It\u2019s not as if they have much of a choice.Hailji is a professor of creative writing at Dongduk Women\u2019s University and is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Republic of Uzupis.\u201d This article was translated by Jake Levine and Sangkeun Yoo from the Korean.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greek Finance Minister Steers Debt Talk His Way", "Date": "2015-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 You would never know from his demeanor that Yanis Varoufakis, the celebrity Greek finance minister, was carrying the weight of a nation on his shoulders. In fact, you could be forgiven for thinking that it was his country\u2019s uncompromising creditors who were on the defensive.Rather than concede any Greek missteps, Mr. Varoufakis wanted to assess the flaws of the eurozone that he said had been revealed by the 2008 global meltdown and its aftermath.\u201cThere is no doubt that if we had a federal republic, if we had a United States of Europe, we would not be here discussing the Greek crisis, the eurozone crisis, banking union or anything of the sort,\u201d he said in an onstage conversation with the Nobel laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz, at a conference of the Institute for New Economic Thinking. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he added, \u201cthe way we designed the eurozone, it was crying out for a crisis.\u201dMr. Varoufakis, as is now well known, became finance minister in January as part of the Syriza-led leftist government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, which came to power promising voters to renegotiate the \u20ac240 billion international bailout, whose terms Athens blames for sending the economy into a tailspin and leaving more than 50 percent of Greek youth jobless.When Mr. Stiglitz asked him how Greece\u2019s creditors could have repeatedly overestimated the country\u2019s ability to grow under the terms of the bailout, Mr. Varoufakis replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s the politics of denial.\u201dEven making Thursday\u2019s payment to the I.M.F. required scraping together money from the government\u2019s dwindling resources. It staved off a default for now, but did nothing to solve the bigger problem: that the government is running out of cash to meet obligations like paying pensions and the wages of public employees. To obtain another tranche of desperately needed bailout funds, Greece still has to persuade its highly skeptical creditors \u2014 which also include the European Central Bank and the European Commission \u2014 that Athens has a credible economic overhaul plan.And even Mr. Varoufakis\u2019s visit to Washington last weekend, where he had promised the repayment to the I.M.F. chief, Christine Lagarde, was not without turmoil. The Greek representative to the I.M.F., Thanos Catsambas, an appointee of a previous Athens government, did not take part in the weekend meeting and subsequently tendered his resignation, according to Greek news media.Mr. Varoufakis, 54, comes across as a sort of debonair Mr. Spock, a financial Vulcan of the eurozone. Dressed in a dark jacket with his trademark casual, open-collared shirt, he speaks clearly about the currency bloc\u2019s awkward truths, avoiding the jargon and evasiveness that normally characterizes the region\u2019s dreary politics.Appearing on a separate panel with Mr. Varoufakis on Thursday, the Irish central bank chief, Patrick Honohan, referred to the \u201cglass being half full\u201d after Ireland\u2019s bailout and tentative recovery.\u201cI don\u2019t like the metaphor,\u201d Mr. Varoufakis said. \u201cIn the case of my country, the glass is broken.\u201dHe said he it was difficult trying to make people understand that part of the currency union\u2019s problem was the imbalances between countries like Germany, which runs a persistent current-account surplus, and those like Greece, whose very different mix of exports \u2014 Germans make machines, Greeks grow olives \u2014 still has not recovered despite a 40 percent drop in real wages since the onset of the crisis.Regardless of how low wages in Greece fall, Mr. Varoufakis said, alluding to the belt-tightening pressures from its creditors, Greek cars \u201care not going to be competitive with Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, simply because we don\u2019t make cars.\u201dHe also pleaded for time to develop a deep economic restructuring plan that could be embraced by the Greek people.After five years of austerity imposed by creditors, \u201cthe word \u2018reform\u2019 resonates in Greece like the word \u2018democracy\u2019 in Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dirty word.\u201d If the Greek public doesn\u2019t \u201cown\u201d the overhaul plan, he said, \u201cthey will not cooperate, they will see it as a forced occupation.\u201dMr. Varoufakis repeated his assertion that Greece should not have joined the euro union in the first place. But he said the media seemed to have misunderstood his position on the merits of staying in, now that Greece is part of the union.\u201cI don\u2019t believe anyone should have become a member of this eurozone, the way it\u2019s designed,\u201d Mr. Varoufakis said. \u201cBut, it\u2019s one thing to say we should never have joined and another to say we should leave it.\u201dNiki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leonardo DiCaprio Builds an Eco-Resort", "Date": "2015-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBlackadore Caye, a 104-acre island in Belize, is the property of the actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Jeff Gram, the owner of a nearby island. A partnership including Mr. DiCaprio and Paul Scialla, the chief executive of Delos, a New York development company, is planning to build an eco-conscious resort at\u00a0Blackadore Caye.In what may be his highest-impact leading role yet, the actor Leonardo DiCaprio, the Oscar-nominated \u201cWolf of Wall Street,\u201d is planning to heal an island.A well-known environmental activist, Mr. DiCaprio bought Blackadore Caye, 104 acres of wild, unpopulated land off the coast of Belize, with a partner soon after he set foot in the country a decade ago. \u201cIt was like heaven on earth,\u201d he said, speaking by telephone from Los Angeles. \u201cAnd almost immediately, I found this opportunity to purchase an island there.\u201dBut the \u201cRestorative\u201d in the title refers not just to the impact the island might have on visitors, but to the island itself. Blackadore Caye has suffered from overfishing, an eroding coastline and the deforestation of its mangrove trees, and the partners mean to put it back to rights.Blackadore Caye is a 45-minute boat ride from Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport in Belize City and a 15-minute boat ride from San Pedro, the nearest big town. The island has been used for hundreds of years, according to Juan Rovalo, a biologist who leads a team of scientists studying the caye.It was a popular spot for fishermen, who would stop on their way to markets in Mexico and cut mangrove, using the wood for fires to smoke their catch and the conch that they took from the reef, littering the island with thousands of empty shells. More recently, he said, the island\u2019s once plentiful palm trees have been uprooted and used to landscape the grounds of hotels in San Pedro.The villas for guests on Blackadore Caye will be built atop a massive platform that stretches in an arc over the water, with artificial reefs and fish shelters underneath. A nursery on the island will grow indigenous marine grass to support a manatee conservation area, and mangrove trees will be replanted, replacing invasive species. A team of designers, scientists, engineers and landscape architects, some of whom have spent more than 18 months studying Blackadore Caye, will monitor the resort\u2019s impact on its surroundings.\u201cThe main focus is to do something that will change the world,\u201d Mr. DiCaprio said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have gone to Belize and built on an island and done something like this, if it weren\u2019t for the idea that it could be groundbreaking in the environmental movement.\u201dAn avid scuba diver, Mr. DiCaprio first visited Belize in 2005 to swim its barrier reef. \u201cAs soon as I got there, I fell in love,\u201d Mr. DiCaprio said. \u201cBelize is truly unique. It has the second largest coral reef system in the world, and it has some of the most biodiverse marine life, like the manatee population and almost every species of fish you can imagine. Then there are the Mayan temples and the culture.\u201dMr. DiCaprio said it had taken him 10 years to find the right development partner; a deal with Four Seasons Hotels fell through. \u201cMy goal was always the fact that I wanted to create something not just environmental, but restorative,\u201d he said. \u201cA showcase for what is possible.\u201dMr. DiCaprio serves on the Delos advisory board, along with Deepak Chopra, the self-improvement guru; Richard A. Gephardt, the former United States representative from Missouri; and doctors at the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic.\u201cThe idea at Blackadore Caye is to push the envelope for what sustainability means \u2014 moving the idea beyond environmental awareness into restoration,\u201d Mr. Scialla said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to just do less harm or even have zero impact, but to actually help heal the island, to make it better than before.\u201dMr. DiCaprio, who sits on the boards of several nonprofits, including the World Wildlife Fund, was an early investor in Delos. He also owns an apartment at 66 East 11th Street, which he rents out.Yet Belize has not enjoyed the same environmental protections as, say, Costa Rica, which was one of the first countries to capitalize on ecotourism.\u201cI think Belize, in the past, it hasn\u2019t been as stringent and we have seen an adverse impact, especially near the coast,\u201d said Nadia Bood, who is the head of the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s Belize office. Belize is hoping to reverse this trend and in 2013, developed a strict zoning plan for its coastline that is under review and, according to Ms. Bood, should pass into law later this year.But while ecotourism is a hot topic, it is unclear if it actually works.\u201cNo hotel can be truly sustainable because you have to fly to get there,\u201d said Jan H. Katz, a senior lecturer at the Cornell School of Hotel Administration. \u201cIf you really care about sustainability, instead of enlarging your carbon footprint by flying to a remote island and then creating the garbage that they need to compost, just give money to a conservation program.\u201d What people are buying, Ms. Katz said, is the status of staying at an exclusive eco-resort.Mr. DiCaprio and Mr. Scialla look at it another way. Visits to Blackadore Caye, they say, will help reverse some of the environmental damage the island has already suffered. While Blackadore Caye is not occupied \u2014 the scientists studying there must camp and pack in their own food \u2014 it has been affected by human activity.\u201cBetween removing the mangrove and the palms and other indigenous plants,\u201d said Mr. Rovalo, the biologist, erosion has taken its toll on the coastline and the small dunes that protect the island. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201ca small wind is all that is needed to create a big wave that goes directly into the island\u2019s soil and starts the erosion process.\u201dAmong the design principles that Mr. McLennan is using is the concept of sacred geometry, in which the proportions of buildings are derived from mathematical proportions found in nature.\u201cMany of Delos\u2019s evidence-based health-wellness amenities and technologies will be built into the architecture,\u201d he said, \u201csuch as state-of-the-art LED circadian lighting and controls that help support optimal sleep at night and alertness throughout the day, as well as advanced air and water purification systems to ensure the highest quality air and water. Additionally, healthy, nontoxic materials and finishes will be used exclusively throughout.\u201dAlmost 45 percent of the island will be designated a conservation area. The resort will be built using as many native materials as possible, and the developers hope to rely on local laborers, who will be trained in green-building techniques.As for the guests, guidelines will dictate what they can take with them to the resort. Plastic water bottles, for example, will not be allowed on the island. Once there, guests will go through an ecology orientation program.The 68 guest villas will have access to nearly a mile of secluded beach, grassland and jungle. Prices for a stay at the villas have not been announced. For those vacationers who prefer their own houses, 48 will be built on the island, with price tags ranging from $5 million to $15 million. Some of the houses will boast both a sunrise and a sunset beach, and homeowners will pay a monthly fee for housekeeping, meals and other services.Each building will have several functions, with the platform, for example, not only sheltering guests on top and coral and fish underneath, but also harnessing the breeze that comes off the water to keep the villas cool.\u201cThe goal was to create something that wasn\u2019t contrived \u2014 a tiki hut or some image of a Hawaiian getaway \u2014 but rather the history of the place, the Mayan culture, with a more modern approach,\u201d Mr. McLennan said. \u201cWe want to change the outlook of people who visit, on both the environment writ large and also their personal well-being.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Economy Puts New Pressure on Its Lopsided Job Market", "Date": "2015-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Wang Junping worked as a farmer in his native Hebei Province and as a coal miner in Inner Mongolia. But on a recent afternoon, Mr. Wang, 49, smartly dressed in a suit jacket, was awaiting lessons at an employment agency on the proper way to use a broom and mop to clean Beijing\u2019s sprawling subway system.A high school graduate, Mr. Wang quit his job at a mine last year after his pay was cut in half. Still, he decided against the cleaning job because the salary was too low, at around $320 a month.\u201cBeijing is the capital city and the window for cultural and political exchange,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cI believed it would be easy to find jobs. But actually it\u2019s not that easy.\u201dChina has a job market mismatch.Agriculture jobs have been declining for years, the result of urbanization and the country\u2019s continuing economic transformation. And China\u2019s huge manufacturing sector is showing new signs of stress, as some companies struggle with rising debt and rampant overcapacity.China\u2019s services business, which includes industries like logistics, retail, information technology and sanitation, is booming, driving job creation across the entire economy. Around 300 million people now work in services in China, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the world\u2019s largest work force.But workers are not easily making the switch. Unskilled or semiskilled workers like Mr. Wang can be a bit choosier now as growth of the pool of migrant workers slows. At the same time, soaring university enrollment means new graduates often struggle to find the high-paying white-collar jobs they were expecting.The job market \u2014 and its lopsided pockets of supply and demand \u2014 presents a critical test for policy makers. For more than a decade, China\u2019s urban work force swelled and incomes rose in the double digits, matching or exceeding the heady economic growth rates in those years.\u201cWe\u2019re in this weird position where the Communist Party leadership seems completely comfortable with the idea that every year G.D.P. growth, wage growth \u2014 everything in the economy \u2014 is going to be growing a little bit more slowly,\u201d said Andy Rothman, an investment strategist at Matthews Asia in San Francisco.The leadership in Beijing has repeatedly signaled that slower growth is acceptable as long as the job market holds up. While China has moved in recent months to support the economy, cutting interest rates twice and freeing banks to lend more twice, some analysts say a still-sound job market is the reason it has not adopted a more aggressive approach.China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, recently sought to play down the importance of the G.D.P. growth target, saying instead that he preferred to focus on whether the economy was expanding in a way that created new jobs. And so far, it appears to be doing that. China added 13.2 million new urban jobs last year, surpassing Mr. Li\u2019s official target of 10 million such jobs.But Mr. Li\u2019s jobs target is a gross figure. It does not factor in jobs that were eliminated. And more important, income growth is decelerating, down from double digits to around 8 percent last year. Any resulting pullback in consumer spending would have a direct impact on the service sector\u2019s ability to continue to create jobs.\u201cRisks is not the right term, but there are some imponderables,\u201d Mr. Conrad added. \u201cIf you look at the magnitude of the structural changes going on, it\u2019s not always easy to predict the outcomes, including for employment.\u201dData on China\u2019s job market lack the frequency and general quality of figures in more developed markets. For example, the official urban unemployment rate, published quarterly, has ranged from 4 to 4.3 percent for the last decade, a level of stability that economists say is hard to achieveInstead, shifts in the health of the job market tend to show up more clearly in wage and recruiting trends. Here, two overarching factors have emerged in recent years: The pool of migrant workers is tightening as the returns from urbanization diminish, while a shortage of white-collar jobs for new college graduates points to a skills mismatch.\u201cIt is difficult to hire workers, even if the economy is not doing that well,\u201d said Juble Lu, a manager at the Zhihua Kitchen Cabinet Accessories Factory in the southern city of Guangzhou.Factories like Ms. Lu\u2019s rely largely on China\u2019s migrant work force of 175 million. But this pool of laborers is growing today at about only 1 percent a year, much slower than the broader economy. That tighter market tends to give bargaining power to workers and push up wages. For skilled workers, Ms. Lu said, wages could rise by as much as 20 percent a year. \u201cWorkers still have their many demands,\u201d she said.The tighter migrant labor pool is symptomatic of the broader growth slowdown. For more than a decade, China has been able to increase the size of its economy by several percentage points a year simply by people moving from farms to factories, where their productivity in economic terms soared. Today, that trend is slowing as the economic returns from urbanization become relatively smaller.\u201cA lot of the migration that is going to happen has already happened, and the people left in rural population who are not part of the migrant labor pool are either too young or too old, or have other barriers keeping them from migrating,\u201d said Andrew Batson, the China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics, based in Beijing.Income trends are further suppressing potential migration to the cities. In recent years, rural incomes have been rising faster than urban ones. \u201cYou can\u2019t make the same on the farm as in the city, but at the margin things are getting better,\u201d Mr. Batson said. \u201cWhat you have to pay them to leave the homestead is rising.\u201dContrast this with the situation at the other end of the job market. Having prevailed in the country\u2019s ultracompetitive entrance examinations, new university graduates, usually from one-child families, have high expectations as they seek their first jobs.But the realities of the market quickly set in. At nearly seven million a year, China today produces twice as many university graduates as it did 10 years ago. The supply appears to be outpacing the demand from prospective employers. According to official data, about 88 jobs requiring graduate-level education are available for every 100 such job seekers. For those with only vocational high school qualifications, the ratio climbs to 104 jobs for every 100 candidates.\u201cThe reality is that a taxi driver in Beijing, unskilled, can make more money than a new university graduate,\u201d at least initially, said Mr. Conrad of the Asian Development Bank. \u201cThis is of course shocking for these young people.\u201dChina\u2019s new graduates have traditionally shied away from working in factories, seeing this as a sign of lower status. But, perhaps because of the slowdown, there are signs this is changing. Dai Chaoyang, general manager of Shanghai Kadun Power Tools, says his company, which manufactures power drills, has started hiring new graduates in management trainee positions.\u201cThey do not mind working in a factory environment,\u201d Mr. Dai said, \u201cas long as they are not working on the assembly line.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing, and Hilda Wang contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Risky Moves in the Game of Life Insurance", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn July 2013, the smart money was saying the company that runs the Caesars and Harrah\u2019s casinos would go bankrupt, when a big investor, Apollo Global Management, offered a lifeline: It was willing to pump millions of dollars into the parent of the struggling casino company.And where would Apollo get the money?Not a problem. Apollo, which already had a big stake in Caesars, also had been building a life insurance division called Athene. That division was bursting with cash from the premiums paid by life insurance policyholders.\u201cAthene Life Insurance and Annuity Company has tens of billions of dollars under management,\u201d said Steve Pesner, a lawyer who took Apollo\u2019s proposal to the Nevada Gaming Control Board for approval. It could spare some to help Caesars, in exchange for a promissory note and some nonvoting stock.\u201cThis is essentially an investment by Athene, indirectly, in Caesars,\u201d another lawyer for Apollo, David Arrajj, told the board.State insurance commissioners are supposed to watch the premium dollars that policyholders send their insurers, making sure the money is invested safely so that policies can be paid out when the holders die. Investment-grade bonds are fine. But money for a troubled casino company? Controlled by the same giant investment firm as the insurer? That could be a problem.But the Nevada Gaming Control Board polices casinos, not insurers. It unanimously approved the transfer. This January, the operating company that runs much of Caesars went bankrupt. That does not mean that Athene will stop paying its claims tomorrow, but it suggests that something bigger is afoot \u2014 something that affects all American taxpayers, whether or not they buy life insurance.Changing the RulesThe life insurance business is supposed to be dull \u2014 sell policies; collect premiums; salt the money away in the safest sorts of investments, mostly bonds; pay out benefits; and make money along the way by investing surplus assets prudently. No wild bets, no siphoning of assets, no off-the-books maneuvers.This, at any rate, has been the idea since a crusading reformer named Elizur Wright set the standard 150 years ago and became America\u2019s first state insurance regulator, in Massachusetts.Wright grew up helping his family shelter fugitive slaves; he went to school with John Brown, ran an abolitionist newspaper, and at age 40, visited the Royal Exchange on a trip to London. There, he saw feeble, penniless old men auctioning off their life insurance policies to speculators. After faithfully paying premiums all their lives, they were too old to work, but they could not withdraw their accumulated savings because, alas, they were not yet dead. Their best hope for survival was to parade their decrepitude and hope speculators would bet on their imminent demise.To Wright, it was little better than a slave auction. Upon his return to America, he began campaigning for a cleanup of the life insurance business, setting a strict, even moralistic tone that persists to this day. He required insurers to pay \u201csurrender values\u201d to policyholders on request and to hold adequate reserves to do so. Seeing how easy it was to cheat, he devised formulas for calculating the reserves. He even invented a device called the \u201carithmeter\u201d \u2014 a 30-foot slide rule, more or less, wrapped around a spinning drum \u2014 that crunched the numbers when the user turned a crank.The companies bought in. Reform fostered trust, and trust spurred sales. Under the gimlet eyes of Wright and his successors, life insurance has blossomed into an $18 trillion business, with millions of policyholders who can sleep soundly on solvency laws as immutable as Newton\u2019s laws of motion: For every liability, there has to be an asset.Or at least that\u2019s the way it may seem.Over the years, life insurance has gone global and created products of dazzling complexity; many companies have gone public, too, creating shareholders who think they should have priority over all those pesky policyholders whose money built the business.With these changes, a belief has taken hold in some quarters: Wright\u2019s principles may still guide us, but they are too old-fashioned. They force life insurers to hold more money than they need to \u2014 the way Athene Life Insurance was expected to sit on its millions when there were needy casinos to help.You hear a lot about \u201credundant reserves\u201d in the industry these days. Many companies would prefer to hold fewer of the stable, low-yielding assets required by law and use the extra money to pay shareholder dividends. Some also want to build more risk into their investment portfolios, in hopes of receiving the higher returns that Wall Street expects.Policyholders may not perceive any of this. But regulators, perhaps paradoxically, are not only aware, but sometimes even eager to allow insurers to add leverage and satisfy their growing appetites for risk. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a 144-year-old support group for state regulators, still issues special reporting standards, called \u201cstatutory accounting,\u201d to help states enforce the law. But the states are also free to administer the rules as they see fit, and in recent years, this has often meant waiving certain rules. The waivers, called \u201cpermitted practices,\u201d can be worth a lot of money.\u201cAny state can deviate from statutory accounting,\u201d said Nick Gerhart, Iowa\u2019s insurance commissioner. \u201cAnd states do deviate.\u201dInside the \u2018Black Box\u2019Here is how captive reinsurance works: A life insurer sells policies, creating long-term obligations. Then it packages the obligations and puts them into a wholly owned subsidiary, called a captive. The captive is said to have reinsured the obligations, meaning that it now has the duty to pay the future claims. The parent is no longer responsible for payment and no longer has to keep all those low-yielding bonds on hand to satisfy the liabilities.You\u2019ve heard of reinsurance; it helps companies spread out risk, which promotes stability. Reinsurance companies tend to be large, independent firms with abundant capital, able to evaluate the risks they take on. A captive reinsurer, by contrast, is just an appendage of its parent, taking over the parent\u2019s risks on the parent\u2019s terms. And the risks don\u2019t really change hands. Putting obligations into a captive and saying they are reinsured is a little like putting dirty laundry into a closet and saying it\u2019s being cleaned.So why is this going on?In its report, Treasury said the trend took off in the early 2000s, after the insurance commissioners association tightened certain reserve requirements. By law, life insurers must hold more than enough money to pay all future claims, and must calculate the amount needed the association\u2019s way. But captives can hold less \u2014 sometimes a lot less. Thus the deals free cash for other purposes, like paying dividends to shareholders.As more and more money has flowed away from policyholder reserves and into the hands of investors, some state regulators have challenged captive reinsurance. New York State\u2019s superintendent of financial services, Benjamin M. Lawsky, has called the transactions \u201cfinancial alchemy,\u201d because they can make money seem to pop out of thin air for insurance companies to grab.Other states disagree. In an emailed response to questions, Mr. Gerhart of Iowa called captive reinsurance \u201ca pragmatic approach to address the nationally recognized problem of redundant reserves.\u201dThe insurance commissioners association has been trying to put the genie back in the bottle, toiling over new rules that would limit captive reinsurance in the future. At a meeting in Phoenix last weekend, it formed a new working group, overseen by Mr. Gerhart, to study why captive reinsurance has now spilled over from life insurance into annuities, a popular retirement-planning tool. \u201cSingle-state solutions do not promote the uniformity that we have worked so hard to achieve in our financial solvency regime,\u201d said Joseph Torti III, the Rhode Island insurance commissioner, who led the discussion. The 2014 Treasury report said that the multitude of \u201cblack box\u201d deals was making it hard for policyholders, and investors, to find out an insurer\u2019s true financial condition. In fact, it was sometimes even hard for state regulators to find out, the Treasury said.But that\u2019s not the case in Iowa. Not only does Iowa encourage the transactions, but in 2010 it enacted unusually open disclosure rules. In many states, and certainly in offshore havens like Bermuda, captive reinsurance is conducted under strict secrecy. But in Iowa, with a little sleuthing, it\u2019s now possible to open the lid of the black box and peek inside.Dealing in I.O.U.sFor years, Iowa has been working to make its capital, Des Moines, an insurance hub, with considerable success. Insurance now accounts for more than 24,000 jobs in and around the city, and for more dollars in the state economy than agriculture.In 2006, a huge British insurer, Aviva, arrived in Des Moines, acquired an insurer based in Iowa and changed its name to Aviva USA.Things seemed to go swimmingly at first. Aviva USA doubled the size of its local work force and spilled over into a handsome new office campus in the suburbs.But then, in 2012, the British parent said it was leaving the United States. Aviva USA was put up for sale. Apollo beat out rival bidders by offering $1.5 billion. But it actually paid the British seller more than that, using about $2.2 billion of the target company\u2019s own money in the form of an \u201cextraordinary dividend.\u201d By the time all the money changed hands, Apollo had paid only $400 million of its own funds for the prize.Sending $2.2 billion to the British seller meant less money to backstop policies in the United States, of course. When asked about this in an administrative hearing on the acquisition, led by Mr. Gerhart, a representative of Athene testified that there was still enough money to keep the insurer well within the regulatory safety zone.But that was with the help of captive reinsurance.The details are complicated but can be pieced together from an outside auditor\u2019s report and regulatory filings that Iowa is making public for the first time. Here is the nutshell version: Apollo wanted only Aviva USA\u2019s annuities business, which it could reinsure through an affiliate in Bermuda. A spokesman said Athene provided $2 billion to the affiliate \u201cto support the new risks it assumed.\u201d In addition, Apollo brought a second company into the acquisition, Accordia Life and Annuity. Accordia was a new insurer created by Global Atlantic, a Bermuda company controlled by Goldman Sachs. As soon as the acquisition closed, in October 2013, Apollo transferred the life insurance business to Accordia.If Accordia followed the N.A.I.C. rule book, it would need about $7 billion in high-grade assets to secure the obligations. But it didn\u2019t have that much.So instead, Accordia set up six subsidiaries to reinsure part of the business for less. Iowa granted a \u201cpermitted practice\u201d exception, allowing i.o.u.s to back the obligations instead of the solid assets, like bonds, that the N.A.I.C. requires.Public financial documents in Iowa show that Accordia followed a pattern set by Aviva. The company and its parent declined to confirm the details in those records or comment on the record.Four subsidiaries, in Iowa and Vermont, were to serve as Accordia\u2019s reinsurers. Accordia sent them some bonds, but nowhere near enough to secure the $3.3 billion worth of obligations that they were to reinsure.Two Delaware subsidiaries then issued the first four subsidiaries contingent notes to fill the gap. Such notes are unsecured promises that Accordia, the parent company, would not be permitted to use. For example, one of the Delaware subsidiaries, named Tapioca View, issued a $499 million note to Cape Verity I, an Iowa subsidiary, which made it look as if Cape Verity I were flush. But if anyone looked closely, they would see that Tapioca View was just a shell, with no business operations, no revenue and no means to make good on a $499 million promise.\u201cHollow assets\u201d is the term New York\u2019s Mr. Lawsky uses for deals like this. But there is little a New York regulator can do when the transaction is in another state.To bolster the credibility of Tapioca View\u2019s i.o.u., footnotes on financial filings show, Cape Verity I then issued a $499 million note of its own, and gave it to Tapioca View. Now, if people glanced at Tapioca View, they would see that it had some sort of asset to back up its promise of $499 million to Cape Verity I \u2014 except it was nothing more than a note from Cape Verity I.To put it more bluntly than the footnotes do, the two subsidiaries were propping up each other\u2019s balance sheets with i.o.u.s.\u201cThey\u2019re enhancing their capital and making themselves look good by using these exotic techniques,\u201d said Joseph M. Belth, a professor emeritus of insurance at Indiana University. \u201cThe whole thing is just a classic shell game.\u201dTo take it one step further, Cape Verity I called its note a \u201csurplus note,\u201d a unique instrument that does not have to be recorded anywhere as a debt. Thus, without so much of a penny as real cash changing hands, Cape Verity I could claim nearly $1 billion: a $499 million note and $499 million of \u201csurplus.\u201d All six subsidiaries passed notes back and forth in this way, making themselves look fit to reinsure $3.3 billion of Accordia\u2019s obligations. A footnote on each of the three Iowa subsidiaries\u2019 financial statements said that without the permitted practice allowing the notes, they would be insolvent.But that information did not flow through to the parent company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Accordia\u2019s statements showed it as financially sound.In his written responses to questions about captive reinsurance, Mr. Gerhart, Iowa\u2019s insurance commissioner, declined to discuss individual companies or transactions, but he said that his staff monitored all deals in Iowa carefully and would intervene if a problem arose. He also said that by opening up certain details of Iowa-based transactions to public scrutiny, Iowa had made it possible for interested parties to assess the risks.\u201cWe wanted to bring transparency to these transactions,\u201d he said.So, before you blame Iowa for playing fast and loose with the legacy of Elizur Wright, remember: Most states now allow captive reinsurance. So do the traditional offshore insurance havens like Bermuda. And most keep it secret. But Iowa has decided to stick its neck out and let people look at the deals, knowing full well that they might not like what they see.The Tax BillThose of you who have never bought life insurance or an annuity may, at this point, be thinking: All these perplexing transactions, these assets that may or may not be real \u2014 aren\u2019t they all somebody else\u2019s problem?Not entirely. You could still be liable if the N.A.I.C.\u2019s old-fashioned formulas turn out to be right and insurers come up short at some point because they bestowed so much money on their shareholders. Mr. Lawsky keeps saying that captive structures remind him of the deals that proliferated in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008. That ended in a giant taxpayer bailout.\u201cI really think what\u2019s going on now is bigger than anything I know of in the past,\u201d Mr. Belth said. He should know. As the author of the article \u201cMore Than a Century of Efforts to Weaken Life Insurance Reserves,\u201d he can compare today\u2019s captive-reinsurance phenomenon with other skirt-the-rules tactics dating all the way back to 1863.American taxpayers are paying for captive reinsurance already, even without another cataclysmic bailout. Life insurance reserves are a business expense for the companies; as such, they are deductible from the insurers\u2019 federal income taxes. And the boom in captive reinsurance deals has led to billions of dollars of unpaid federal taxes.The Internal Revenue Code says companies must use the National Association of Insurance Commissioners formulas to calculate their reserves, and deduct that amount. Then companies do a second calculation of their reserves, which is smaller than the N.A.I.C. method. Accordia, for example, sent $3.3 billion of obligations to its family of subsidiaries, but secured only $1.7 billion worth with admissible assets. The tax code tells Accordia to deduct the entire $3.3 billion, even though the backstop it built cost just $1.7 billion. So its tax deduction was inflated by $1.6 billion.At the top federal tax rate of 35 percent, this suggests about $560 million of taxes avoided.Remember, Accordia is far from the only company using these techniques. Indirectly, invisibly, the taxpayers are shouldering the cost of these activities, through their taxes.If the insurance commissioners association ever finds consensus, it may reduce some of the gamesmanship in the future. But it\u2019s unlikely to require life insurers to unwind their existing reinsurance captives. Some analysts say that if the N.A.I.C. really does rein in captive reinsurance, the industry will just invent some new transaction, and the show will go on.An article on April 12 about complex and risky maneuvers on the part of insurance companies to increase profits referred incompletely to statistics on the rapid growth of one such maneuver, known as captive reinsurance. While the data appeared in a Treasury Department report issued in 2014, the calculations were originally done by Ralph S. J. Koijen of the London Business School and Motohiro Yogo of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, not by the Treasury Department. The omission was only recently called to the attention of The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Nigeria, an Election to Believe In", "Date": "2015-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorABA, Nigeria \u2014 I guessed wrong, and being wrong has never felt so good. Last week, we Nigerians conquered our fears and doubts and elected Muhammadu Buhari to be our new president. He promises to protect all of us better than the party that held power ever since military rule ended in 1999. And the loser accepted the verdict without violence. Though I wished fervently for this outcome, nothing could have surprised me more.Two months ago, when it looked as if President Goodluck Jonathan would either win or manipulate the election to remain in power, I was near despair. My cousin Chidera had just called from Gombe, in Nigeria\u2019s troubled north. A bomb had exploded some 200 yards from where Mr. Jonathan had gone to campaign. Chidera could have been killed, just as my parents might have been last year, when a bomb nearby rocked their home in Kano, forcing them to flee south, near me. Once again, I felt the terror that had stalked my childhood as a Christian in the mostly Muslim north during its periodic religion-incited riots.Today, as a fiction writer living in the south, I have learned to observe people for the wittiest statement, the affecting gesture, the eyes that signal warmth.Four and a half years ago, I recognized those endearing qualities in Mr. Jonathan, when he began his first campaign for president. He appeared a simple man \u2014 shoulders hunched, brows crinkled, eyes misty. He told of poor beginnings, hinting at the possibility of his country, too, rising from nothing. I imagined him, as president, drawing the kids in my village to my grandmother\u2019s black-and-white television. They would watch him say that he, too, once had resources as limited as their own, and they might aspire to grow up to be Goodluck Jonathans. And so, I voted for him.Two days later, reality intruded. Before the winner was declared, my father called from Kano, distraught. He said supporters of Mr. Buhari, a former military dictator who was Mr. Jonathan\u2019s main rival, had taken to the streets, denouncing the election as rigged. He said that they were burning churches and houses and killing non-Muslims. Later, Christian youths with clubs, guns and machetes attacked Muslims in reprisal. The rioting lasted two days, leaving nearly 1,000 people dead in northern Nigeria.And things up north would only get worse. Now we have Boko Haram seizing northeastern communities, proclaiming a caliphate and seeking affiliation with the Islamic State. In three years the terrorists have killed perhaps 15,000 people and displaced over a million.And in the face of such danger, the misty-eyed man I voted for proved cold and ineffectual. He began speaking not with us but at us, and as if he was in a hurry to leave. His eyes were vacant on television; his touching humility seemed mere timidity. When Boko Haram kidnapped dozens of high school girls a year ago, I wished I could reach into my television, shake him, and ask where he was hiding the president I voted for.Nevertheless, he sought re-election, and again faced Mr. Buhari. He made excuses for Nigeria\u2019s gross insecurity and corruption, pointing everywhere but at himself. Mr. Buhari had a likelier explanation: Corruption had shredded our economy, and funds to train and equip our soldiers had been embezzled, leaving them incapable of fighting Boko Haram. Mr. Buhari promised to re-equip our military, and fight both terrorism and corruption. He insisted he was now a democrat. His popularity grew and grew.But we did not dare to think he would win \u2014 especially after elections were delayed by six weeks and tricks began. For example, the number of hours we received electricity shot up from four each day to around 18, at just about the time I got a text message, \u201cI am GEJ\u201d \u2014 Goodluck Ebele Jonathan \u2014 on my phone, seeking my vote.It did him no good. And on Election Day, we were thrilled by suspense over who would win, and by hope there would be no violence. But we held our expectations low, knowing too well that no incumbent had been peacefully voted out of office before. And then, the vote count showed Mr. Buhari the clear winner. Even better, Mr. Jonathan calmly conceded, quieting supporters who had begun to grumble.I sat, stunned, unsure whether to scream my joy or to laugh. I had never thought Mr. Buhari could win; my vote for him was my little attempt to push back at a system that had failed me. As for Mr. Jonathan, I gave him a personal pardon. In his unexpected act of statesmanship, I rediscovered the man I had voted for in 2011.Now Mr. Buhari promises us a world that reads something like a storybook \u2014 a country free of corruption, where people won\u2019t need to uproot their lives to find safety, where our voices are heard, where we aren\u2019t judged by our religion or ethnicity. And his words felt true enough, as though we could reach out and touch this new Nigerian dream.But sometimes, I fear that in a few months we may again be stranded between hope and despair. Chidera, now adjusting to life in southeastern Nigeria, says Mr. Buhari will lead Nigeria in a better second act, and will unify north and south. I struggle to be that optimistic. On May 29, Mr. Buhari will assume the presidency. Will he, too, disappoint us? Even if he does, I feel a certain relief. I now know we can peacefully vote out an incumbent. And that emboldens me. It is why I hold on to Mr. Buhari\u2019s fresh promises \u2014 for now \u2014 and can\u2019t wait to start measuring his performance against them. Or begin preparing myself for the next election.Ukamaka Olisakwe is the author of \u201cEyes of a Goddess.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rahm Emanuel Wins Runoff Election to Secure 2nd Term as Chicago Mayor", "Date": "2015-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith 98 percent of precincts counted, Mr. Emanuel led Mr. Garcia 56 percent to 44 percent.For Mr. Emanuel, 55, it was a narrow escape from what could have been an embarrassing loss to Mr. Garcia, a feisty former alderman and community organizer who for months hammered Mr. Emanuel for closing dozens of public schools and claimed the mayor ignored the working class and poor in the nation\u2019s third-largest city.But Mr. Emanuel fought back by asserting that Mr. Garcia was unqualified for the job and its immense responsibilities, including confronting Chicago\u2019s staggering debt, stubbornly high crime rate and unfunded pension liabilities.The race was closely watched nationally as a test of Democratic centrists by the party\u2019s liberal wing, which has been resurgent with the victory of Mayor Bill de Blasio in New York City and the national prominence of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.At his campaign celebration, surrounded by his wife, Amy Rule; his daughters and son; and his brothers, Ariel and Ezekiel, Mr. Emanuel praised Mr. Garcia as \u201ca good man\u201d who loves Chicago, then thanked voters for giving him \u201ca second term and a second chance.\u201d\u201cI have had the good fortune to serve two presidents. I\u2019ve had the fortune of being elected to Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing mayor of the city of Chicago is the greatest job I\u2019ve ever had and the greatest job in the world.\u201d\u201cTo all the voters, I want to thank you for putting me through my paces,\u201d Mr. Emanuel continued. \u201cI will be a better mayor because of that.\u201d\u201cThis was a hard-fought race, but it\u2019s over now,\u201d Mr. Garcia told supporters at his campaign rally shortly after 9 p.m. Then he echoed a theme of his campaign, saying, \u201cWe need to stop paying too much attention to what happens downtown, and too little attention to what happens in our neighborhoods.\u201dThe survey also found that Chicagoans were divided about the most important issue facing the city. About one-quarter said the state of the city\u2019s finances was most important. A nearly equal proportion chose the city\u2019s public schools and education as the top issue. Another quarter mentioned crime. And a fifth picked the economy and jobs as the No. 1 issue.Voters focused on the city\u2019s finances broke by more than two to one for Mr. Emanuel. He was also favored by voters most concerned with the issue of crime. However, voters most concerned with schools and public education favored Mr. Garcia by a large margin.Overnight, Chicago became the stage for a tightly competitive mayor\u2019s race, the city\u2019s first runoff since it began holding nonpartisan elections 16 years ago, and a contest pitting the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal faction against its centrists.An exit poll was conducted by Edison Research in 30 randomly selected Chicago electoral precincts. There were no supplemental interviews with early or absentee voters.In his first campaign ad after the February election, Mr. Emanuel tried to convince voters that he realized he had faults, including an abrasive style \u2014 but also that his tough exterior was necessary to make difficult decisions.In another, Mr. Emanuel faced the camera and said that while Chicago was \u201ca great city, we can be even better.\u201d\u201cAnd yeah, I hear ya,\u201d he added. \u201cSo can I.\u201dWhether the election actually softens Mr. Emanuel\u2019s persona remains to be seen. But Willie Wilson, an African-American businessman who won more than 10 percent of the vote in the February election and then endorsed Mr. Garcia in the runoff, said that in apologizing for his brash demeanor, Mr. Emanuel might have succeeded in winning over many black voters.\u201cMy feeling is that Rahm is now beginning to be humble, admitting that he would do things differently,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cAfrican-Americans are the most forgiving people on earth, so that was having a big effect on them.\u201dHe attacked Mr. Emanuel, who once held a lucrative job in banking, as a tool of the wealthy people who had donated millions to his campaign. And he criticized Mr. Emanuel\u2019s decision to close nearly 50 public schools, mostly in low-income areas.\u201cTo end the tale of two cities, we must have development and the growth of population in these communities,\u201d Mr. Garcia said while campaigning on the South Side over the Easter weekend.Mr. Garcia, while widely outspent by Mr. Emanuel, collected powerful endorsements from the Chicago Teachers Union and the Service Employees International Union. Karen Lewis, the teachers\u2019 union leader who cut short her own mayoral ambitions when she was diagnosed with cancer last fall, had urged Mr. Garcia to run only in October.In the final days of the campaign, the candidates crisscrossed Chicago, battling for support particularly from African-Americans, who are a powerful bloc in the city, and encouraging residents everywhere to vote early.The campaign raised thorny questions: Could Mr. Garcia encourage Latinos, one of his core constituencies, to vote in higher numbers than in the past? Was he convincing upper-middle-class professionals that he was skilled enough to manage the city\u2019s byzantine finances? And had Mr. Emanuel\u2019s closing of schools and acrimonious relationship with the teachers\u2019 union hurt him deeply among African-Americans?Tuesday began with election officials reporting low turnout throughout the city, an element that added to the unpredictability of the runoff. Chicago\u2019s public schools are on spring break all week, suggesting that many families were out of town on Election Day. Early voting, however, was high: 142,000 people had voted early, a two-thirds increase from the February election.One Chicago Tribune poll showed Mr. Emanuel with a significant lead two weeks before the election; other polls suggested the race was much closer.The six-week fight took a physical toll on both candidates. At recent appearances, Mr. Emanuel appeared drawn and tired, with dark circles under his eyes. During the final weekend before the election, Mr. Garcia rasped when he spoke and complained of flu-like symptoms.Mr. Emanuel marked his final day of campaigning with a lunch at Manny\u2019s Deli, one of Chicago\u2019s landmark Jewish delicatessens. Surrounded by supporters, he ate salad and a steaming bowl of matzo ball soup.It was a friendly room for Mr. Emanuel. \u201cIf anyone can get us out of our financial crisis, he can,\u201d said one supporter a few tables away, Norm Levin, 87, a \u201csemiretired\u201d real estate executive who said there was no question he would vote for the mayor. \u201cI don\u2019t want the city of Chicago to become Detroit.\u201dMitch Smith contributed reporting from Chicago, and David R.

When he retires in June as the Law Department\u2019s second in command, he will have worked for 13 corporation counsels and seven mayors.Mr. Friedlander, who is 68, does not hold the record for longevity among city employees, but unlike most others, in his almost 45 years in the Law Department, also known as the corporation counsel\u2019s office, he has probably confronted all subjects, from the mundane to the headline-grabbing, within the municipal government\u2019s jurisdiction. They have included creating the Civilian Complaint Review Board, expanding the Landmarks Preservation Law and implementing public campaign financing.\u201cThe corporation counsel\u2019s office is central to the city government, not in that it\u2019s a policy-making arm, but that almost anything that is done requires legal counsel and defense,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s very little that is not going to upset one group or another and result in litigation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for this office to provide disinterested advice, to be flexible, to tell elected officials when what they propose cannot be done legally and to devise a way that it can be done.\u201dUnder Mayor Edward I. Koch and Allen Schwartz, the corporation counsel, Mr. Friedlander was named head of the legal counsel division as the office was recovering from brutal cost-cutting during the fiscal crisis in the 1970s.He is proudest of a number of the department\u2019s successes, two of which were achieved during the Koch administration.\u201cWhen Nelson Mandela was here, he credited the work we did with being helpful in dismantling apartheid,\u201d Mr. Friedlander recalled.He also cited his work extending human rights protections against discrimination in accommodations, hiring and housing to include sexual orientation.The department\u2019s finest hour, he said, was in the aftermath of Sept. 11, when it was displaced from its Church Street headquarters for seven months and scattered among 44 locations, but still managed to produce emergency executive orders and legislation and to expedite responses to unanticipated crises.Mr. Friedlander was lawyerly when it came to characterizing the mayors with whom he worked most closely.Koch: \u201cThere were ups and downs, but he was open. A transformative mayoralty.\u201dDavid N. Dinkins: \u201cI loved him, but a difficult mayoralty, because he faced the headwinds of the economy at the time and the situation in Crown Heights.

It was a great opening act.\u201dMr. Friedlander grew up in Manhattan and graduated from Seward Park High School and Hunter College. He lives in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, with his wife, Marjory Karukin Friedlander, a retired librarian.In 1970, his starting salary was a little higher than the average, but not much below the $15,000 or so that major Manhattan firms paid first-year associates then. Today lawyers for the city start at $64,000, but law school graduates in prestigious firms often earn three times as much when they start, plus bonuses, which causes Mr. Friedlander concern about attracting and retaining assistant corporation counsels.The office now has 730 lawyers, which makes it the equivalent of one of the largest law firms in the country.Mr. Friedlander, who was acting corporation counsel from November 1997 to March 1998, now makes $214,501 as the first assistant corporation counsel, a position he has held for about two decades.According to Professor William E. Nelson of New York University Law School, the author of \u201cFighting for the City: A History of the New York City Corporation Counsel,\u201d Mr. Friedlander has served as first assistant counsel longer than any predecessor. Why has every successive corporation counsel kept him on?\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask them,\u201d Mr. Friedlander mused. \u201cIt\u2019s puzzled me.\u201dHis current boss, Zachary W.

{"Headline": "At Global Economic Gathering, U.S. Primacy Is Seen as Ebbing", "Date": "2015-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As world leaders converge here for their semiannual trek to the capital of what is still the world\u2019s most powerful economy, concern is rising in many quarters that the United States is retreating from global economic leadership just when it is needed most.The spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have filled Washington with motorcades and traffic jams and loaded the schedules of President Obama and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. But they have also highlighted what some in Washington and around the world see as a United States government so bitterly divided that it is on the verge of ceding the global economic stage it built at the end of World War II and has largely directed ever since.\u201cIt\u2019s almost handing over legitimacy to the rising powers,\u201d Arvind Subramanian, the chief economic adviser to the government of India, said of the United States in an interview on Friday. \u201cPeople can\u2019t be too public about these things, but I would argue this is the single most important issue of these spring meetings.\u201dOther officials attending the meetings this week, speaking on the condition of anonymity, agreed that the role of the United States around the world was at the top of their concerns.Washington\u2019s retreat is not so much by intent, Mr. Subramanian said, but a result of dysfunction and a lack of resources to project economic power the way it once did. Because of tight budgets and competing financial demands, the United States is less able to maintain its economic power, and because of political infighting, it has been unable to formally share it either.Experts say that is giving rise to a more chaotic global shift, especially toward China, which even Obama administration officials worry is extending its economic influence in Asia and elsewhere without following the higher standards for environmental protection, worker rights and business transparency that have become the norms among Western institutions.President Obama, while trying to hold the stage, clearly recognizes the challenge. Pitching his efforts to secure a major trade accord with 11 other Pacific nations, he told reporters on Friday: \u201cThe fastest-growing markets, the most populous markers, are going to be in Asia, and if we do not help to shape the rules so that our businesses and our workers can compete in those markets, then China will set up the rules that advantage Chinese workers and Chinese businesses.\u201dIn an interview on Friday, Mr. Lew, while conceding the growing unease, hotly contested the notion of any diminution of the American position.\u201cThere is always a lot of noise in Washington; I\u2019m not going to pretend this is an exception,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the United States\u2019 voice is heard quite clearly in gatherings like this.\u201dNonetheless, the challenges keep mounting.An overhaul of the I.M.F.\u2019s governance structure, negotiated five years ago in large part by President Obama to give China and other emerging powers more authority commensurate with their growing economic strength, has languished in Congress. That, in part, propelled China to create its own multilateral lending institution in direct competition with the behemoths in Washington.The efforts to secure an ambitious 12-nation Pacific trade agreement, championed by Mr. Obama and recently backed by a handful of key lawmakers, has set off perhaps the biggest fight of his presidency within his own party, with trade unions, environmentalists and liberal activists lining up in opposition to the White House. There is a strong possibility that Mr. Obama could lose the battle.Even the United States\u2019 Export-Import Bank, a lending agency similar to export financing arms in countries around the world, could be killed in June by conservatives in Congress, leaving would-be foreign customers in the cold and many American exporters at a disadvantage to competitors abroad.\u201cI\u2019ve been searching for a word to describe it, and the one I use is \u2018withdrawal,\u2019 best I can come up with,\u201d said Edwin M. Truman, a former Obama Treasury official now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cWe\u2019re withdrawing from the central place we held on the international stage.\u201dIn Washington, that concern crosses party lines.\u201cThis is really about a crossroads for America and its leadership for the world,\u201d said Representative Dave G. Reichert, Republican of Washington. \u201cWe set the tone, we set the path for the global economy by being leaders. And if we don\u2019t, other countries step in.\u201dThe costs could be real. Failure to bolster the I.M.F. and other institutions weakens the West\u2019s hand in confrontations like the one with Russia over Ukraine, which has begged for multilateral economic assistance. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, pointed to conflicts like the one in Syria, suggesting that fears the I.M.F. and World Bank will be unable to help rebuild the shattered country only opens the door to confrontational actors like Iran.\u201cSometimes we can only hope it\u2019s China that steps in,\u201d he said.But China\u2019s rising sway in Africa, South Asia, and even Latin America could blunt efforts by the United States and its allies on a range of issues, from stemming violent extremism to slowing climate change.For much of Washington and the world\u2019s economic leaders, China\u2019s creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank crystallized the choice policy makers face. Earlier this month, Lawrence Summers, who was a top economic adviser for both President Bill Clinton and Mr. Obama, declared that China\u2019s establishment of a new economic institution and Washington\u2019s failure to keep its allies from joining it signaled \u201cthe moment the United States lost its role as the underwriter of the global economic system.\u201dFor years, China had threatened to establish institutions to rival those dominated by the West, like the I.M.F., World Bank and Asian Development Bank \u2014 or even to establish its currency, the renminbi, as a reserve currency to rival the dollar.In 2010, Mr. Obama brokered a deal to raise China\u2019s stake in the I.M.F. to 6 percent from 3.8 percent, still far below the United States\u2019 vetoing share of 16.5 percent but enough to give Beijing a larger say. Congress has blocked the proposed adjustment.Meantime, China\u2019s international lending has soared. Fred P. Hochberg, who heads the Export-Import Bank, said that in the last two years alone, Chinese state-run lenders have lent $670 billion. Ex-Im has lent $590 billion since it was created during the Depression of the 1930s.With nearly $4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, China has plenty of resources to project its rising economic power. For example, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, plans to offer $46 billion to Pakistan for infrastructure assistance that would open new transportation routes across Asia and challenge the United States as the dominant power in the region.\u201cThe United States has lost its way and is rapidly forfeiting claims to global financial, economic, political and moral leadership,\u201d Kevin Rafferty, a former World Bank official, wrote recently in two leading English-language newspapers in Asia. He blamed the White House: \u201cNot for the first time, Obama has shown he can talk eloquently, but does not have a political clue how to get things done.\u201dOther experts and historians, however, say too much can be made of the moment. Walter Russell Mead, a professor of foreign affairs at Bard College, noted that the rise of China as an economic force was inevitable, and that its establishment of a rival lending institution was far different from the international behavior of the Soviet Union and communist Chinese during the Cold War.Then, he said, America\u2019s rivals were trying to destroy and replace the economic order established by the United States and Britain after World War II. Now, emerging powers are emulating it, however imperfectly.Whatever the ultimate consequences, there is plenty of finger-pointing going on. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a potential ally on international economics, echoed Mr. Rafferty. In an interview, he said he included the I.M.F. quota adjustment in an aid package last year to beleaguered Ukraine, but Mr. Obama, he insisted, did not personally intervene to push it through.He fretted that new legislation granting the president \u201cfast track\u201d trade-promotion authority to complete major trade deals with Asia and Europe would stall without enough White House attention.\u201cI was in Southeast Asia in August, and the countries there know there\u2019s no real capital being expended, and they\u2019re worried,\u201d Mr. Corker said, his voice rising in frustration. \u201cThey just cannot pull themselves together to push for something.\u201d Administration officials disputed the charge.\u201cI can tell you I have spent dozens if not hundreds of hours talking to central bankers and finance ministers,\u201d Mr. Lew said. \u201cThey understand we are sparing no expense.\u201dThe opposition to international trade alliances, on the other hand, is being led loudly by Democrats who had previously been the president\u2019s most stalwart backers, with an assist from ardent conservatives who oppose anything Mr. Obama does.Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia and an emerging internationalist advocate, suggested that two decades of war were turning elements of both parties inward.\u201cThe network of international rules and institutions is a peculiarly U.S. creation\u201d that has helped foster peace and prosperity for decades, he said. \u201cThe U.S. has built this up, not only for our own benefit but for the world. That we are now stepping back from a leadership role is highly, highly problematic.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Subway Madness", "Date": "2015-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAnyone who has squeezed into a subway car recently in New York City knows in a very up-close and uncomfortable way that the city\u2019s mass transit system is overloaded. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority confirmed this week that ridership has indeed soared. The system handled 1.75 billion rides last year \u2014 a number not seen since the late 1940s, when many fewer people drove. That compares with just over a billion rides in 1980 and 1.3 billion in 2000. Move NY, which would use an electronic system designed to take tolls speedily like E-ZPass, could provide about $1.5 billion a year, enough to leverage the money necessary for capital investments for the M.T.A. New signaling systems and other technology would allow more trains to run more frequently, easing overcrowding. Meanwhile, the new tolls would ease gridlock, a word Mr. Schwartz is credited with popularizing years ago, by cutting traffic into Manhattan by an estimated 15 percent.Broad political support for Move NY appears to be growing, as everyday commuters realize that money is tight and that a system where some pay and others don\u2019t is fundamentally lopsided. Federal money is flat, at best. Fares from subway users, who suffer stalled trains and weekend outages, are already high enough. And an increase in the gas tax, another option, has powerful opponents in Albany.Mayor Bill de Blasio can play a positive role. He can increase the city\u2019s annual contribution to the M.T.A., but equally important, he can try to persuade state legislators who represent the city to get behind what is plainly an imaginative and equitable plan to support the city\u2019s troubled mass transit system.

{"Headline": "Unequal, Yet Happy", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionTHE gaping inequality of America\u2019s first Gilded Age generated strong emotions. It produced social reformers like Jane Addams, anarchist agitators like Emma Goldman, labor leaders like Eugene V. Debs and Progressive politicians like Theodore Roosevelt. By the 1920s, sweeping legislation regulating food and drugs and breaking up corrupt trusts had been passed. The road to the New Deal was paved.But our current Gilded Age has been greeted with relative complacency. Despite soaring inequality, worsened by the Great Recession, and recent grumbling about the 1 percent, Americans remain fairly happy. All of the wage gains since the downturn ended in 2009 have essentially gone to the top 1 percent, yet the proportion of Americans who say they are \u201cthriving\u201d has actually increased. So-called happiness inequality \u2014 the proportion of Americans who are either especially miserable or especially joyful \u2014 hit a 40-year low in 2010 by some measures. Men have historically been less happy than women, but that gap has disappeared. Whites have historically been happier than nonwhites, but that gap has narrowed, too. In fact, American happiness has not only stayed steady, but converged, since wages began stagnating in the mid-1970s. This is puzzling. It does not conform with economic theories that compare happiness to envy, and emphasize the impact of relative income for happiness \u2014 how we compare with the Joneses. But if happiness depends on status, and if status depends on relative income, wouldn\u2019t today\u2019s historic income inequality predict a giant happiness gap? Why hasn\u2019t this happened? There\u2019s no denying that socioeconomic status is still a strong predictor of social status. And class lines have become hardened. But in its cultural expression \u2014 and therefore in its effects on our happiness \u2014 inequality is increasingly disorganized. Consumerism has expanded the lifestyles, niches and brands that supply the statuses we seek. As a result, social status, which was once hierarchical and zero-sum, has become more fragmented, pluralistic and subjective. The relationship between relative income and relative status, which used to be straightforward, has gotten much more complex. For most of human history, inequality of wealth meant inequality of happiness. Status, and its related activities, envy and emulation, drove consumption. By the 1950s, rapidly rising standards of living across the West, combined with social pressures to conform, all conspired to intensify status competition. The architects of \u201crebel cool,\u201d like Jack Kerouac and Norman Mailer, responded by rebelling against emulation consumption and the status hierarchy of postwar America. They inverted the dominant social hierarchy, rejecting the values of those at the top and appropriating the values of those who had been marginalized at the bottom. The pursuit of \u201cthe cool,\u201d in our view, fundamentally altered the psychological motivations underlying our consumer choices. In conspicuous consumption, our emulation of higher-ups means we compete directly for status because we want what they have. But rebellious consumption changed the game, by making a product\u2019s worth depend on how it embodied values that rejected a dominant group\u2019s status. There\u2019s no longer any one way to keep up with the Joneses. If the Joneses drive a BMW 3 Series, you can compete by buying a BMW 4 Series. But if the Joneses drive a minivan, you can drive a sport utility vehicle to rebel against their staid domesticity. (This is what happened in the 1990s, when suburbanites embraced the S.U.V. as a symbol of fun and adventure.) And if the Joneses drive an S.U.V., you can drive a Prius, or forgo a car altogether \u2014 as a sign that you embrace a green lifestyle. By comparing a PC user to an Orwellian drone while likening a Mac user to a sexy athlete in its iconic \u201c1984\u201d ad, Apple made a fundamental claim about the allure of its products. Today, Apple products are expensive because they\u2019re seen as cool; they\u2019re not cool because they\u2019re expensive (which is still the case for many luxury goods). A new neuroscience of consumer behavior reinforces our argument. In one experiment, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to understand our brains\u2019 reaction to perceived coolness. We selected students from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif., and asked them to rate, from uncool to cool, hundreds of images from the following categories: bottled water, shoes, perfumes, handbags, watches, cars, chairs, personal electronics and sunglasses. We also included images of celebrities (actors and musicians). The cooler objects typically weren\u2019t the more expensive ones: our subjects rated a Kia hatchback above a Buick sedan, for example.We then asked other students to look at images of these objects and people on a screen above their eyes, while in an fMRI scanner. The most striking finding: Asking people merely to look at products and people they considered \u201ccool\u201d sparked a pattern of brain activation in the medial prefrontal cortex \u2014 a part of the brain that is involved in daydreaming, planning and ruminating \u2014 similar to what happens when people receive praise. Our brain\u2019s medial prefrontal cortex, in short, tracks our social esteem. A new generation of ethnographers has discovered an explosion of consumer lifestyles and product diversification in recent decades. From evangelical Christian Harley-Davidson owners, who huddle together around a motorcycle\u2019s radio listening to a service on Sunday mornings, to lifestyles organized around musical tastes, from the solidarity of punk rockers to yoga gatherings, from meditation retreats to book clubs, we use products to create and experience community. These communities often represent a consumer micro-culture, a \u201cbrand community,\u201d or tribe, with its own values and norms about status.Among the millennials (generally defined as those born between 1981 and 1997) the diversity of status-seeking has been especially pronounced. Studies have found that teenagers and young people in their 20s commonly use musical taste as an indicator of their identity and values. No doubt, these tastes are also shaped by ethnicity and class. Nonetheless the variety of possible identities is striking. While the top 1 percent of songs each year account for something like 75 percent of all artist revenues, there are 43 million songs are for sale currently in the iTunes store. The neuroscience of consumerism doesn\u2019t exonerate our political and economic systems for the chasm of inequality that defines contemporary America. When a group feels unfairly deprived of material wealth, respect, rights or freedoms relative to other groups, that relative deprivation mobilizes political action. The proliferation of consumer choice helps explain why today\u2019s Gilded Age hasn\u2019t sparked as much outrage as the last one. Money may not buy happiness in the long run, but consumer choice has gone a long way in keeping most Americans reasonably content, even if they shouldn\u2019t be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2% Inflation Rate Target Is Questioned as Fed Policy Panel Prepares to Meet", "Date": "2015-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 The cardinal rule of central banking, in the United States and in most other industrial nations, is that annual inflation should run around 2 percent.But as the Federal Reserve prepares to start raising its benchmark interest rate later this year to keep future inflation from exceeding that pace, it is facing persistent questions about the wisdom of the rule and the possible benefits of significantly increasing its target.Higher inflation could disrupt economic activity, but it also would enhance the Fed\u2019s power to stimulate the economy during recessions. And some experts say the struggles of the Fed and other central banks to provide enough stimulus since the Great Recession suggest they could use more room for maneuvering.As the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee concludes a two-day meeting in Washington on Wednesday, officials were expected to discuss how much longer the central bank should hold its benchmark rate near zero, as it had done since December 2008. Officials had planned to start raising rates between June and September, but growth has fallen short of the Fed\u2019s expectations this year, which could delay the liftoff.Inflation has mostly remained well below the 2 percent target since the global economic downturn. The Fed\u2019s preferred measure, published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, rose just 1.4 percent during the 12 months ending in February.But Fed officials want to start raising rates in anticipation of stronger growth and faster inflation. William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said last week that \u201chopefully\u201d the Fed would make its first move this year.There is little prospect that any major central bank will raise its inflation target in the foreseeable future. Two percent is a global standard and the official line \u2014 in Japanese, German and English \u2014 is that it was carefully chosen, and that the stability of the target is a virtue in its own right.There is also considerable political opposition to higher inflation. Some conservative economists and politicians argue that central banks should aim to keep inflation well below 2 percent.But the broaching of the inflation targeting issue by Mr. Rosengren and other prominent officials \u2014 including Olivier Blanchard, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund \u2014 suggests an emerging willingness among policy makers to revisit an issue that for more than a generation has been treated as all but written in stone.The case for raising the 2 percent target rests on the counterintuitive idea that moderate inflation is a good thing, helping to grease the wheels of commerce and prevent an outright fall in prices. This is widely accepted by economists. It is the reason that central banks aim for a modest inflation rate, rather than keeping prices at the same level from year to year. The question is, How much?Central banks influence economic growth by raising and lowering borrowing costs. Higher costs crimp risk-taking; lower costs stimulate expansion. Those costs, expressed as interest rates, combine the price of money with an additional increment to compensate for inflation. Higher inflation means rates will run higher in normal times, allowing the Fed to make larger cuts during periods of duress.In recent decades, as inflation generally declined, the Fed has had less room to make cuts. The Fed, for example, cut rates by 6.75 percentage points beginning in 1989, and by 5.5 points beginning in 2001. On the eve of the crisis in 2007, the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate stood at 5.25 percent. The Fed rapidly reduced that rate almost to zero \u2014 but that did not provide enough stimulus on its own to revive the economy.Laurence Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, proposed in a 2013 paper that central banks should adopt 4 percent inflation targets. The benefits of avoiding a return to the so-called zero lower bound, he said, outweighed the potential economic disruption.The case for a higher target has been strengthened in recent years by a global decline in borrowing costs, which might be offset by higher inflation.And some economists regard even those estimates as optimistic. Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, argues that the developed world may have entered a period of \u201csecular stagnation\u201d in which borrowing costs are unlikely to rise significantly above current levels because of chronic lack of demand.\u201cIf you really thought that\u2019s the world we\u2019re in because of the demographics or productivity growth \u2014 if that\u2019s really what our future holds \u2014 I think that\u2019s just a reality that you need to think about monetary policy and its ability to achieve goals,\u201d Mr. Williams said. But Mr. Williams, like most central bankers, is not yet ready to do so.He said the Fed had demonstrated in recent years that it retained considerable power to stimulate growth even after cutting rates nearly to zero through bond purchases and by announcing that it intended to keep rates near zero for an extended period.David Lipton, the senior American official at the I.M.F., said recently that the crucial lesson was that central banks needed to take such measures more quickly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t necessarily that you ought to be at 3 or 4, it\u2019s that when you\u2019re at 2 you\u2019re just much more careful about preventing it from falling,\u201d he said.It is also possible that rates will increase more than the Fed expects, easing the pressure. Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, has argued in response to Mr. Summers that rates are being suppressed by a \u201csavings glut\u201d in some countries, notably Germany, that is likely to dissipate as growth improves.James Hamilton, a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, co-wrote a recent paper that reached a similar conclusion.\u201cI don\u2019t see anything magical about targeting 2 percent inflation,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said at a panel sponsored by the I.M.F. But he added that the costs and disruptions of moving to a higher target could outweigh the benefits.A higher inflation target also would require political support. Congressional Republicans already are upset that the Fed is trying to raise inflation back toward 2 percent. They would loudly object to any effort to enshrine a higher target.Some Fed officials also see considerable costs in tolerating more inflation. Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, said at a separate I.M.F. event this month that it was important to keep inflation low enough so that people did not need to pay it any attention.

{"Headline": "Chile Joins Other Latin American Nations Shaken by Scandal", "Date": "2015-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Wednesday, Ms. Bachelet told reporters that she lamented the emergence of a \u201cculture of distrust\u201d in the wake of the scandals.But she also insisted that Chile\u2019s institutions were doing their job by investigating figures, including those in her own family, while making it clear she had no plans to step down.\u201cI have never considered resigning,\u201d she said, adding that such a move would amount to an \u201cinstitutional rupture.\u201dMs. Bachelet said she, like nearly everyone else, learned of the business dealings of her son, Sebasti\u00e1n D\u00e1valos, from news reports in February, when he was accused of trying to secure a $10 million loan with the help of one of Chile\u2019s richest men, Andr\u00f3nico Luksic.The bank that Mr. Luksic\u2019s family controls granted the loan a day after Ms. Bachelet was re-elected in December 2013, providing the money to a company partly owned by Ms. Bachelet\u2019s daughter-in-law, according to investigators. The company used the loan to buy land that was flipped weeks later in a deal producing an estimated profit of several million dollars.The land deal is still under investigation. But whatever the legality, the scandal has accentuated an enduring source of tension here over Chilean politics and business \u2014 the use of connections to exert influence and obtain wealth \u2014 embarrassing a leader who had made leveling the playing field a major goal.Few Chileans could even fathom obtaining a meeting with Mr. Luksic to ask for a loan of such magnitude, Am\u00e9ricaEconomia, a business magazine based here, said in a scathing editorial.\u201cWhether they\u2019re from the left, center or right, the members of a small elite have the money and power in their hands,\u201d the magazine said.After her son resigned as head of the charitable foundation normally run by Chile\u2019s first lady, Ms. Bachelet\u2019s approval ratings plunged to 31 percent, a record low in either of her two terms, according to Adimark, a polling company. The public opinion survey, conducted in interviews with 1,258 people from March 5 to March 27, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points.\u201cThe opposition is on the floor with its scandals, but this is a personal tragedy for Bachelet,\u201d said Robert Funk, a professor of political science at the University of Chile. \u201cThere was a sense of moral superiority around Bachelet, and now she\u2019s struggling to regain legitimacy.\u201dTrying to find her footing, Ms. Bachelet is appointing an advisory committee to draft new measures to regulate the ties between political figures and business interests.\u201cThese have been difficult and painful times for me as a mother and a president,\u201d Ms. Bachelet recently said in reference to the revelations about her son.Of course, Chile is far from alone in grappling with issues of privilege and politics in Latin America, or elsewhere. Echoing other scandals in the region, some of the practices exposed at Penta, the Chilean financial group with jailed executives, and SQM, the mining company under investigation over payments to political figures, appear to involve illicit ways to evade taxes, fund campaigns and influence politicians.The rising sensitivity over corruption in Chile and other parts of Latin America reflects the strengthening of the region\u2019s middle classes this century, accompanied by an emboldened sense of citizenship that holds political leaders to higher ethical standards. With economic growth slowing throughout the region, tempers are flaring.\u201cDuring the boom period, with greater social spending, corruption did not have the gravity and political consequences that it has when times are tough and governments have little choice but to carry out fiscal adjustments,\u201d said Michael Shifter, president of Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington.Chile has important advantages in limiting the scope of corruption, including a vibrant civil society and an independent judiciary. The economy, while growing slower than in recent years, is still expected to expand by about 2.5 percent this year, a rate countries like Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela would envy.Some here also point out that the scandals, while shocking in Chile, are still on a different scale from others in the region. In Brazil, Ms. Rousseff, with an approval rating of 13 percent, faces a stagnant economy and sprawling scandals involving bribes and tax fraud resulting in losses well into the billions of dollars.\u201cChileans think we\u2019re in the middle of an acute crisis, but I liken it to a trip to the emergency room with some chest pains,\u201d said Patricio Navia, a Chilean political scientist at New York University. \u201cWe get there and we see Brazil, having a real heart attack, and the doctor tells us we\u2019re overweight, not exercising, maybe smoking too much.\u201d\u201cThe doctor\u2019s message,\u201d Mr. Navia continued, \u201cis that we\u2019ll end up with a heart attack five years down the road if we don\u2019t change our ways now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley: Perks for Some Workers, Struggles for Parents", "Date": "2015-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWork-Life BalanceTech companies shower their employees with perks like dry cleaning, massages and haircuts. But there is one group for whom working at a tech company can be much more difficult than working elsewhere: parents.Facebook hosts all-night hackathons. Google has weekend laser tag retreats. Many start-ups have no parental leave policy at all, so the first employee to have a baby has to ask the company to create one.That Silicon Valley \u2014 known for being on the forefront not just of technology but also of workplace policy \u2014 creates so many difficulties for working parents highlights a vexing problem for the American economy. The United States is arguably struggling to adjust to the realities of modern family life more than any other affluent country.More broadly, some economists say, the lack of family-focused policies reflects the power imbalance between companies and workers in the American economy today. The share of economic output flowing to corporate profits has surged, while employee compensation has stagnated.The technology industry is a striking example because it attracts some of the country\u2019s smartest people, many of whom have far more bargaining power than most workers. Silicon Valley also has outsize cultural significance, as the face of American ingenuity and a magnet for global talent.But it is also a place that often expects total commitment to work. That grows from the notion that in tech, unlike in other industries, companies become overnight successes, and believe their work is changing the world.\u201cPeople who give you millions of dollars for nothing but an idea at the very least expect your complete commitment to that idea,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, the online real estate brokerage. \u201cThat is why nobody, not even the most committed parent, talks about a family-friendly workplace in, say, an investor pitch deck.\u201dStart-ups are unlikely to have parental policies because they are more focused on growing as quickly as possible. Many big tech companies try to ease the way for new parents, at least officially \u2014 but that does not necessarily filter down to company culture.But these examples exaggerate how family-friendly tech companies are, especially after the newborn phase. The executives have privileges not available to typical workers (Ms. Mayer built a nursery next to her office.) Some benefits, like free meals and on-site laundry, have a flip side of discouraging people from leaving. And many parents say that office culture \u2014 which can, for example, reward people based on how many lines of code they can write per week \u2014 does not support parents.\u201cFrankly what I\u2019ve seen is just forgetting the human aspect of it,\u201d he said.Though it\u2019s off limits for interviewers to ask candidates whether they have children, tech companies use euphemisms to indicate that parents or older employees are not welcome, said a tech executive who would speak only anonymously. They say people are not a good \u201cculture fit\u201d and cannot \u201calign on priorities\u201d or make it in a \u201crapidly moving company.\u201d The translation, he said: \u201cPeople who are not exactly like us.\u201d\u201cWhen people have kids, they have other priorities \u2014 and start-ups can be pretty brutal about not having other priorities,\u201d the executive said.\u201cI\u2019ve seen the people who are doing that sprint sometimes collapse before making it to the finish line,\u201d Mr. Schireson said. \u201cBuilding a significant company takes time.\u201dAs Silicon Valley ages, and 20-something entrepreneurs become 30-something parents, the culture is beginning to change. Offering a family-friendly workplace has become a recruiting strategy.The Happy Home Company, a home repair start-up, specifically recruits parents. \u201cSome of the most qualified, talented and passionate people in the valley are often overlooked by start-ups for not being a \u2018cultural fit,\u2019 which is often code for \u2018too old, too much of a parent, too female, too different,\u2019 \u201d said Doug Ludlow, its co-founder.At Mr. Taylor\u2019s company, Quip, which makes workplace collaboration software, the founders tell interviewees that they have children and leave at 5:30 p.m. If he wants to work later, Mr. Taylor said, he goes home so other employees don\u2019t feel obligated to stay.\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re visionary \u2014 we\u2019re just older,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really helps us recruit people who were concerned about the culture at other companies.\u201dIn some ways, an aging Silicon Valley is beginning to look more like the rest of corporate America, where most workers have families. The challenge is retaining the youthful optimism that they can do the impossible \u2014 while also showing their employees that working and having families is realistic.Advertisement"}

If Europe, Russia or China does not enforce sanctions, then they are not nearly as effective.Finally, sanctions do not in themselves achieve our foreign policy goals.

At that time President John F. Kennedy stated that a missile fired against the United States from Cuba would be deemed as if it had come from the Soviet Union and that we would respond as such.

{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Invasion of Privacy", "Date": "2015-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Koreans have had to deal with a series of affronts to their privacy recently, but one blow stings more than the rest: The country\u2019s three main telecommunication companies \u2014 KT, SK Telecom and LG Uplus \u2014 have been funneling subscriber information to law enforcement agencies whenever a request is made, without demanding a warrant or informing affected customers.They gave away names, addresses, resident registration numbers and other customer information pertaining to more than six million phone numbers in the first half of 2014 alone. All of that data now sits with law enforcement authorities, with no prospect of disposal.The collusion between telecom firms and the state is just another item in a long list of invasions of privacy by the government since President Park Geun-hye became a contender for high office more than four years ago. Some commentators warned that Ms. Park\u2019s election might stoke authoritarianism because of her appeal among conservatives who honor her late father, the anti-Communist dictator Park Chung-hee, but no one predicted the republic of surveillance that has taken shape under her watchful eyes.This downward spiral began during the tenure of President Lee Myung-bak, Ms. Park\u2019s predecessor. But under this president, surveillance has reached new heights.Initially, government monitoring was said to have something to do with reducing crime, social instability and pro-North Korean activities. But surveillance has become so commonplace that the government and the public seem to have forgotten its purpose. Policing the Internet, poring over private chats, installing an ever-increasing number of close-circuit television cameras and collecting information on telecommunication users are all part of this government\u2019s tool kit. Ms. Park\u2019s first year in power was dominated by talk of how the National Intelligence Service, South Korea\u2019s main spy agency, had monitored and participated in Internet discussions ahead of her December 2012 election in order to spread more positive views of the ruling party and Ms. Park, and to discredit the opposition. In the aftermath of the scandal, there was much handwringing about the need to better supervise state agencies and prevent similar abuses in the future.Some measures took effect, such as the introduction of more checks on the power of the N.I.S. and the conviction the former N.I.S. chief, Won Sei-hoon, who was sentenced to three years in prison for intervening in the election. Yet state encroachment on freedom and privacy is worsening.It was Ms. Park who remarked last September that insults and online rumors about her had \u201cgone too far,\u201d prompting prosecutors to set up a special team for monitoring the Internet. At that same time, in an alarming case reported in South Korean media, police officials and prosecutors investigated a teacher who demanded the president\u2019s resignation online, and sought to obtain a warrant for her arrest, citing her use of Gmail, which is inaccessible to South Korean law enforcement and therefore indicative of some guilt, in the government\u2019s view. Then in October, it came to light that the N.I.S. had been obtaining warrants to look at chats on KakaoTalk, the top mobile messaging app, in the name of ferreting out pro-North Korean activists. The following month, a committee in the National Assembly began deliberating a motion from a lawmaker of the ruling Saenuri Party that would amend a law to compel operators to install surveillance equipment that would help the state monitor citizens. Such officially mandated privacy violations are unfolding in a country already obsessively watched through close-circuit television cameras. In 2013 South Korea had more than 565,000 government CCTV cameras, up from 364,000 in 2011 and 462,000 in 2012. While former President Lee by no means reacted warmly to criticism, Ms. Park and the Saenuri Party have shown a special zeal for suppressing challenges to her and her policies, jumping to label speech and activities opposing the official agenda as jongbuk or \u201cpro-North Korea\u201d and thus criminal. Ms. Park may see the ratcheting up of surveillance as the only way to hold together a nation facing an old foe to the north and deeply divided between the left and the right. But the conscious exaggeration of security threats and the spread of paranoia through increased surveillance also help her administration advance economic policies that aim to protect oligarchic interests, deregulate state industries and to marginalize labor unions \u2014 all in the name of stability and growth. In principle, Articles 17 and 18 of South Korea\u2019s democratic Constitution prohibit the infringement of \u201cprivacy\u201d and \u201cprivacy of correspondence.\u201d But conservatives have sought to minimize those guarantees by invoking Article 37, which allows for curtailing rights \u201cwhen necessary for national security, the maintenance of law and order or for public welfare.\u201dInternational condemnation is mounting over South Korea\u2019s direction. Freedom House now classifies South Korea\u2019s Internet and press freedoms as only \u201cpartly free\u201d and has downgraded the country\u2019s political rights rating by a notch for 2014. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both called on the government to stop undermining freedom of expression, particularly in the arenas of politics and journalism.Eventually, Ms. Park\u2019s policies will threaten to undermine the \u201ccreative economy\u201d she says she wants to stimulate. Her security and surveillance abuses are turning people away from the very technology companies that the country needs to stay competitive. South Korea\u2019s abrupt regression from a much-touted model of democracy into a land of fast-dwindling freedom is a cautionary tale even in this global age of surveillance. The erosion of privacy rights can and must be halted. We must be able to keep talking freely, even when there are those who would prefer our silence and blind submission. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Norway Reverts to Cold War Mode as Russian Air Patrols Spike", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBODO, Norway \u2014 From his command post burrowed deep into a mountain of quartz and slate north of the Arctic Circle, the 54-year-old commander of the Norwegian military\u2019s operations headquarters watches time flowing backward, pushed into reverse by surging Russian military activity redolent of East-West sparring during the Cold War.\u201cIt is more or less the same as when I started,\u201d said General Lunde, who began his career tracking Soviet warplanes as a Norwegian Air Force navigator in the early 1980s.Last year, Norway intercepted 74 Russian warplanes off its coast, 27 percent more than in 2013, scrambling F-16 fighters from a military air base in Bodo to monitor and photograph them. This is far fewer than the hundreds of Soviet planes Norway tracked off its coast at the height of the Cold War. However, last year\u2019s total was a drastic increase from the 11 Russian warplanes Norway spotted 10 years earlier.In Norway, a country that takes pride in championing peace \u2014 witnessed in its brokering of pacts between Israelis and Palestinians and its awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize \u2014 what General Lunde called the \u201cnew old normal\u201d has come as a jolt. It has set off debate over military spending and highlighted how quickly Mr. Putin has shredded the certainties of the post-Cold War era.Nobody expects Russia to invade. So far, its warplanes have taken care not to stray into Norwegian airspace, unlike in the Baltics, where they regularly violate borders.Russia\u2019s muscle-flexing is due in part simply to the fact that the country is spending more on its military and has re-established abilities eroded during the post-Soviet chaos of the 1990s. When Mr. Putin first became president in 2000, Russia spent $9.2 billion on its military, but this has since risen 10 times and will increase again this year despite a slumping economy, hammered by a collapse in the price of oil and also by Western sanctions.\u201cThe signal they are sending is that the situation in the 1990s was an exception,\u201d General Lunde said.Jens Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister who became NATO\u2019s secretary general late last year, said that Russia\u2019s new assertiveness was not just a result of increased funding and revived ability. He said it was also \u201cpart of a broader picture where we see that Russia is willing to use force,\u201d most notably in Georgia in 2008 and, more recently, in Ukraine.\u201cIt is this total picture that gives us reason for concern,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said.Ukraine, he added, is very different from Norway, which is a member of NATO. Ukraine is outside the alliance and has no prospect of joining any time soon. However, Mr. Stoltenberg said, Norway and other NATO countries that share a border with Russia also have to deal with Russian efforts to \u201cintimidate its neighbors,\u201d no matter what their status.Russian air activity along the borders of NATO, the northern parts of which are patrolled by fighters based in Bodo, increased 50 percent from 2013 to last year, according to the alliance. At the same time, Russia sharply increased so-called snap military exercises, training maneuvers that, in violation of established procedure, were either announced at the last minute or kept secret.Katarzyna Zysk, a researcher at the Norwegian Institute of Defense Studies, said Mr. Putin had emphasized strengthening Russia\u2019s military presence in the Arctic; equipping the Northern Fleet, based in Murmansk, with new nuclear submarines; setting up a string of bases along the vast northern coast; and reopening abandoned Soviet-era military facilities like the base at Alakurtti, close to Finland.Norway, she said, \u201cdoes not count for Russia as Norway, but only as a member of NATO.\u201d\u201cFor them, it is the door to NATO,\u201d she continued.This link, she said, has made Russia particularly suspicious of Svalbard, a demilitarized cluster of Norwegian-controlled islands in the high Arctic that Moscow believes serves as a platform for eavesdropping and other covert activities by NATO.While neither Russia nor Norway officially views the other as a direct threat, \u201cthe potential for inadvertent escalation is very serious,\u201d Ms. Zysk said.If anything, however, Russia\u2019s behavior has undermined its one clear and constant long-term objective: the weakening of NATO, which the Kremlin\u2019s chief propagandist, Dmitry K. Kiselyov, described last year as a \u201ccancerous tumor\u201d that must be removed.Norway, along with all but three other European members of NATO, still spends less than 2 percent of its gross domestic product on its military, the target that all 28 members of the alliance are supposed to meet.But Ms. Soreide, the defense minister, said Norway had stopped cutting and would increase military spending this year by 3.3 percent, despite economic troubles caused by the collapse in the price of oil, Norway\u2019s principal export.Russia is \u201cnot viewed as a military threat,\u201d she said, but it has changed the rules of the game by creating so much uncertainty about its intentions. \u201cUntil a threat arrives at your doorstep, you don\u2019t know what will happen,\u201d she added.NATO\u2019s tightening bonds are on display daily at the Bodo air base, where Norwegian fighter pilots, idled for years by the absence of Russian planes to follow, once again have a sense of purpose. A busy NATO outpost during the Cold War, Bodo served as a hub for U-2 spy plane flights over the Soviet Union. Francis Gary Powers, the U-2 pilot imprisoned in Moscow in 1960, was on his way to Bodo when his plane was shot down.But once the Soviet Union unraveled, Bodo fell into the doldrums, leaving Norwegian fighter pilots with nothing much to do.Linked by secure telephone to the Combined Air Operations Center of NATO in Uedem, Germany, his squadron gets a call whenever Russian planes appear off the Norwegian coast and then has only 15 minutes to get airborne.\u201cIt is like doing extreme sports,\u201d the commander said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of military rules. He described a special thrill in being able to get close to and photograph new Russian aircraft, adding that he had been the first to take a picture of Russia\u2019s Su-34, a new fighter bomber. \u201cThat was very exciting,\u201d he said.\u201cWe are now getting back to the normal way of thinking,\u201d the squadron commander added.But he questioned whether public opinion had caught up with the fact that a predictable post-Cold War era of East-West comity was now over. \u201cThe problem in Norway is that we are so rich, fat and happy that we are not worried enough,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Comparably equipped, hybrids are close to $2,000 more than diesel Jettas and $4,000 above gas models.Head straight to the Toyota store for hatchback practicality and pure fuel efficiency.

Mr. Welch, a 5-foot-7 dynamo, is a coiled spring given to rapid-fire speech. \u201cThere could not be two more different people,\u201d Mr. Govindarajan noted.Mr. Welch presided over a 20-year span of business deregulation, rising global competition in manufacturing, and the ascent of the Wall Street-led finance economy. He moved quickly, before G.E. was really threatened. His tactics were widely copied, and he delivered an extraordinary run of profit growth, making him one of the most admired corporate executives of his generation. (His pop-culture profile was heightened when he was held up as a role model by the fictional network executive Jack Donaghy on \u201c30 Rock,\u201d on which Mr. Welch made a cameo appearance.)Mr. Immelt has not had that kind of tenure. He took over G.E. just a few days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the economic aftershock hit G.E.\u2019s aviation, power generation and reinsurance businesses hard. Later, the financial crisis proved an even greater long-term setback.\u201cWhat Welch was able to do was quickly put his stamp on the company, but Immelt inherited a tougher problem,\u201d said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cIt\u2019s been a slow, long slog.\u201dUnder Mr. Welch, and even afterward, the finance business was a money spinner, accounting for half of G.E.\u2019s profits in some years.But since the financial crisis hit in 2008, G.E. has been steadily paring back its finance arm, whose portfolio had swelled to include ventures like owning office buildings in suburban Chicago and consumer lending in Japan.By 2018, G.E. plans to get less than 10 percent of its profit from GE Capital, and more than 90 percent of earnings from its industrial products and services. And G.E.\u2019s finance business will be mainly confined to lending to G.E. customers who are buying its industrial machinery like jet engines, power generators, medical imaging machines and oil field equipment.\u201cWhere G.E. is going to end up is back to the future,\u201d said Noel M. Tichy, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, referring to the origins of the company\u2019s finance arm, which offered credit to buy G.E. products, including household appliances in the Depression.Mr. Tichy, who once headed G.E.\u2019s management training center in Crotonville, N.Y., said Mr. Immelt\u2019s strategy was the latest version of a historical pattern for the company. \u201cG.E. has morphed its corporate portfolio to the environment, and generally successfully,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a key reason it has survived and thrived over the years, when other industrial companies have not.\u201dMr. Immelt said \u201cthe timing is really right to do this\u201d and called it a \u201cseller\u2019s market.\u201d Presumably, the potential buyers think otherwise and believe their asset purchases from GE Capital will prove handsomely profitable.Yet G.E. is motivated more by strategy than by trying to fine-tune the timing of individual asset sales. The company, Mr. Immelt observed last week, had ridden GE Capital both up and down over the years. But the current move, he said, is about investing the company\u2019s management and financial resources in \u201cour leading high-tech industrial businesses.\u201dThe management team\u2019s goal, Mr. Immelt said, is to have investors and others \u201csee G.E. as an industrial company\u201d and one with \u201cmore growth, more focus and less risk.\u201dG.E.\u2019s corporate resilience, management experts say, owes a lot to its capability to train executive talent. \u201cMarkets shift all the time, but G.E.\u2019s leadership engine is strong, and it has picked successors pretty well \u2014 and not necessarily predictable choices,\u201d said Michael Useem, director of the Center for Leadership and Change Management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.Mr. Welch himself was a striking departure from his predecessor, Reginald H. Jones, who ran G.E. from 1972 to 1981. Mr. Jones was a dapper industrial statesman, mending and forging ties with government. He was a champion of strategic planning, building up that capability at corporate headquarters to guide investment decisions and to control G.E.\u2019s diverse industrial businesses worldwide.Mr. Welch dismantled the planning department of his predecessor, eliminated layers of corporate hierarchy and shed thousands of workers, earning him the nickname Neutron Jack.For Mr. Welch, the tough action was done in pursuit of improved corporate performance and to fend off the challenge of Asian rivals, mainly from Japan in the 1980s. His diversification moves into finance and broadcasting with NBC were partly to give G.E. ballast, adding businesses that faced little, if any, foreign competition.Speaking at Stanford in 2010, Mr. Immelt reflected on the different circumstances that he and Mr. Welch faced and the limits of the past as a guide to the future in management. \u201cI learned a lot from Jack, and I think Jack was a great C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Immelt said.But he went on to say that the present was as different from 1997, toward the end of Mr. Welch\u2019s tenure, as the present was from 1927. \u201cThere\u2019s no comparison to the worlds we\u2019re in,\u201d Mr. Immelt said. \u201cYou do it your way, you keep your mouth shut, and you let your own pathway work.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arkansas Moves to Revise Legislation as Concerns of Religion and Gay Rights Intensify", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLITTLE ROCK, Ark. \u2014 Facing a backlash from businesses and gay rights advocates, Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas on Wednesday urged lawmakers to rework legislation billed as a religious freedom measure to ensure that it mirrors federal law.Mr. Hutchinson became the second Republican governor in two days to call for changes to a measure he had previously supported. Speaking to reporters in an ornate conference room at the State Capitol, Mr. Hutchinson said he understood the divisions in Arkansas and across the nation over same-sex marriage and that his own son, Seth, had asked him to veto the bill, which critics say could allow individuals and businesses to discriminate against gay men and lesbians.\u201cThe issue has become divisive because our nation remains split on how to balance the diversity of our culture with the traditions and firmly held religious convictions,\u201d he said. What is important from an Arkansas standpoint is one, we get the right balance,\u201d he added. \u201cSecondly, we make sure that we communicate we\u2019re not going to be a state that fails to recognize the diversity of our workplace, our economy and our future.\u201d Besides asking for the bill to be recalled and amended, Mr. Hutchinson said he was considering issuing an executive order \u201cprotecting against discrimination\u201d within the state government.The Indiana law has touched off a storm of protests from businesses, local governments and college athletics.By late Wednesday, after a day of meetings among lawmakers and multiple revisions, the State Senate voted 26 to 6 to approve a bill closely mirroring the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, as the governor had requested. The bill will go to the House for a vote that is expected Thursday.The bill, as well as a similar one passed in Indiana, would allow religious parties as well as small businesses and larger corporations if they are substantially owned by members with strong religious convictions, to claim exemptions from government mandates. While the bills do not mention gays or discrimination, some supporters have made clear that their intent is to protect Christian individuals and businesses, including caterers and florists, who do not want to provide services to same-sex couples. The measures are more far-ranging than somewhat similar federal legislation passed in 1993, and they have sparked an outcry from business and gay rights groups.As Arkansas moved to change the bill, lawmakers in Indiana were also racing on Wednesday to add a provision to a similar law there that would satisfy that law\u2019s critics. With the N.C.A.A. Final Four arriving in Indianapolis this weekend, Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, has said he wants \u201ca fix\u201d by week\u2019s end that will make clear that the state\u2019s new law does not give businesses the right to deny services to anyone, including gay men and lesbians.For hours on Wednesday, leaders in Indiana\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature met behind closed doors with members of the business community and others attempting to draft new language. The intent, some involved in the revisions said, was to explicitly note that the law could not be used to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. The hope, some said, was to hurry the addition through both chambers as early as Thursday, attached to an unrelated bill as a way to speed matters along.Yet significant obstacles remain. Democrats have said they want a repeal of the entire law and some conservatives have said they will oppose any watered-down measure. The revisions had not been completed as of late Wednesday.The controversy over the bills left two Republican governors caught between the moderate, business wing of their party and its social conservative base. Mr. Pence signed the Indiana version last week \u2014 only, he admitted, to be caught by surprise by the backlash. Mr. Hutchinson, less than three months into his term, had previously said he would sign a measure.But Mr. Hutchinson\u2019s even tone on Wednesday was strikingly different from the defensive approach of Mr. Pence, who blamed \u201creckless reporting\u201d and \u201cgross mischaracterizations\u201d for his state\u2019s problems.In a speech of vintage Arkansas pragmatism, Mr. Hutchinson spoke of a country divided over same-sex marriage and how it clashed with the religious beliefs of others. \u201cThis is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said. \u201cBut these are not ordinary times.\u201dSome critics of the bill welcomed Mr. Hutchinson\u2019s plan. Walmart, which had denounced the law, commended the governor in a brief statement, while Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, who was at the Capitol on Wednesday, expressed \u201ccautious optimism.\u201dProponents of the bill were less positive.In the immediate aftermath of Mr. Hutchinson\u2019s statement, Jerry Cox, the president of the Arkansas-based Family Council, a conservative lobbing group, was more succinct: \u201cNo bill or no amendment, that\u2019s our position right now.\u201dAlready in his young term, Mr. Hutchinson, who was previously a United States representative and a federal official, has navigated such partisan topics as Medicaid expansion and Common Core and arrived at solutions that, at least in the short term, left most people satisfied.\u201cHe\u2019s the MacGyver of American politics,\u201d said Bill Vickery, a lobbyist in Little Rock, referring to the television character famous for his ability to defuse bombs.The governor was flanked at the news conference by Jonathan Dismang, the president pro tem of the Senate, and Jeremy Gillam, the House speaker, both Republicans who have reputations for moderate pragmatism. Both expressed support for the governor but acknowledged the work it would take for the members of their chambers, which have Republican majorities, to go along.\u201cI think we\u2019ll give it a serious look,\u201d said Representative Kenneth Bragg, the House majority leader. \u201cI think they just want assurance that adopting the federal statue isn\u2019t going to weaken too much of what we did in our state version. That\u2019s the key.\u201dThere were several sections in Arkansas\u2019s original bill that departed from the federal law. It broadened the category of those who could cite religious faith to claim protection from a law or regulation. Corporations and institutions \u2014 and not just individuals and family businesses \u2014 could make that claim under the original legislation. The bill also, according to legal experts, allowed people to assert that their religious freedom was being violated in conflicts in which the government was not directly involved, such as between a private business and a customer.The bill\u2019s chief sponsor, Representative Bob Ballinger, had insisted throughout the process that the measure did reflect the federal law, though it incorporated the jurisprudence of intervening years, such as the Supreme Court\u2019s decision exempting the company Hobby Lobby from complying with a government mandate to cover contraceptives for employees. But the senator who presented the bill in his chamber, Bart Hester, contradicted that. \u201cOur bill certainly does not mirror to the federal R.F.R.A.,\u201d he said on Wednesday, using the acronym for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \u201cThat was intentional.\u201dThe Republican turnaround was striking. Just this week, before the bill was passed by the House, Representative Camille Bennett proposed that the bill be sent back to committee to make it more in line with the federal version. Her proposal was shot down 62 to 26.Mr. Hutchinson at the same time was working behind the scenes all that day to defuse the growing opposition, meeting with lawmakers and fielding potential changes that would assuage critics. \u201cHe was asking for advice and suggestions for how to mitigate the damage and move forward in a constructive way,\u201d said Representative Warwick Sabin, a Democrat, who throughout the day crafted language for an amendment or a separate bill that he sent to the governor\u2019s staff. But Mr. Ballinger was not interested in any amendments, Mr. Sabin said, and \u201cit appeared that the support was not there\u201d for a separate anti-discrimination law.It was on Wednesday morning that the plan was circulated among legislators to revise the bill so it was more in line with the federal law. That evening, it appeared to be working, despite the dim prospects only hours before.\u201cThis is politics,\u201d Mr. Hester said. \u201cEnvironments change in an afternoon.\u201dMonica Davey contributed reporting from Indianapolis, and Timothy Williams from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuban Expectations in a New Era ", "Date": "2015-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialWhether, and how quickly, their aspirations for greater prosperity and for better communications within Cuba and the rest of the world are met will depend largely on their own government. One change is already clear: the Obama administration\u2019s gamble on engaging with Cuba has made it increasingly hard for its leaders to blame their economic problems and isolation on the United States. While the American and Cuban governments have yet to formally re-establish full diplomatic relations, some early concrete steps are promising. Obama administration officials and business executives have met in recent weeks with Cuban officials to explore how American companies can help upgrade the nation\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure and provide cheaper and more available Internet service. Executives from Google, whose platforms and services are widely desired in Cuba, visited the island in mid-March to make headway in the company\u2019s goal of establishing its presence there. A number of Cuban dissidents have arrived in Panama City to participate in sideline events. The regional leaders should not ignore them, but rather work to amplify their voices. They have struggled for years to be heard in their own country, where those critical of the Communist system have faced repression. Others who cannot afford a trip to Panama or are restricted from traveling have pledged to hold a parallel meeting in Cuba, where those who favor greater freedoms have been dismissed as a fringe group. Increasingly, the government will have to reckon with the fact that many of the dissidents\u2019 aspirations are shared by most Cubans. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "United States Embassy, Tehran", "Date": "2015-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The nuclear deal with Iran is still only preliminary but if concluded it will represent the most important American diplomatic achievement since the Dayton Accords ended the Bosnian war two decades ago. That agreement was imperfect. Still, not another shot was fired in anger after the loss of more than 100,000 lives. This accord, too, reflects harsh realities \u2014 Iran has mastered the nuclear fuel cycle \u2014 yet represents the best possibility by far of holding Iran short of a bomb, ring-fencing its nuclear capacities, coaxing change in the Islamic Republic, and ushering a hopeful society closer to the world. If the yardstick is effectiveness, and it must be, no conceivable alternative even comes close. Perfection is not part of diplomacy\u2019s repertoire.President Obama, through his courageous persistence, has changed the strategic dynamic in the Middle East. As he reassures worried allies, especially Israel and Saudi Arabia, he has also signaled that the United States will pursue its national interest, even in the face of fierce criticism, where the logic of that interest is irrefutable. Blocking Iran\u2019s path to a bomb, avoiding another war with a Muslim country, and re-establishing diplomatic contact with a stable power hostile to the butchers of the Islamic State amounts to a compelling case for an America faced by a fragmenting Middle Eastern order.It is not a bad thing to remind allies that enjoying irrevocable support from the United States cannot mean exercising a veto on American actions. Indeed, it may be a good thing, because it stimulates creative reflection. This breakthrough with Iran, impossible without the tireless work of Secretary of State John Kerry, looks like the cornerstone of Obama\u2019s foreign policy legacy.Of course, the president needed partners. He found them in other major powers, but most of all in President Hassan Rouhani of Iran who, as Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace observed to me, \u201caspires to be Iran\u2019s Deng Xiaoping.\u201d Rouhani\u2019s mantra is: Preserve the system, fast-forward the economy, open to the world.Rouhani does not aspire to be Iran\u2019s Gorbachev. His thing is adaptation, not transformation. He is of the system, hence his room for maneuver. Unlike Iran\u2019s hard-liners, he believes preservation of Iran\u2019s theocracy is compatible with \u2014 perhaps dependent on \u2014 normalized relations with the rest of the world, including the United States. That is a potential game-changer.Perhaps the most significant words after the agreement came from Rouhani: \u201cSome think that we must either fight the world or surrender to world powers. We say it is neither of those, there is a third way. We can have cooperation with the world.\u201d He added: \u201cWith those countries with which we have a cold relationship, we would like a better relationship. And if we have tension or hostility with any countries, we want an end to tension and hostility with those countries.\u201dThere were no qualifiers there \u2014 not for \u201cThe Great Satan,\u201d as the United States has been widely known in Iran since the theocratic revolution of 1979, not even for Israel. The message to the fight-or-surrender, heads-in-the-sand hard-liners was clear. Once again, Rouhani suggested he is a more courageous and resourceful reformer than Iran\u2019s other presidential reformist, Mohammad Khatami, who spoke a good line but could not deliver.Many Iranians are rubbing their eyes in disbelief: Obama\u2019s post-accord statement broadcast in Tehran (selfies taken against that TV backdrop became popular); praise of Obama\u2019s understanding of Iran from former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani; support for the preliminary agreement at Friday prayers.\u00a0A revolution that delivered not freedom but oppression is now promising reasonable adaptation to changed times. But of course Iran has often veered from reason.Renewed disappointment is not implausible. There are implacable opponents of this American-Iranian d\u00e9tente in both countries. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has been silent, even if things could never have come this far without his backing. He may well fight to keep the nuclear deal hermetic, sealed off from a wider opening. Rouhani takes an opposite view: He wants a nuclear deal that is a catalyst to fixing Iran\u2019s relations with the world. Obama, too, has spoken of his hope that a concluded deal \u201cushers in a new era in U.S.-Iranian relations.\u201dAt the very least, if finalized, the deal condemns the United States and Iran to interact for more than a decade. They will be in conflict about most things. That\u2019s alright. Institutionalized discord is far better than traumatized alienation. I cannot see the accord being hermetic. There\u2019s too much pent-up expectation among Iran\u2019s youth, too much economic possibility, too much pro-Western sentiment in Iran, too much American business interest in Iran. Of course, that\u2019s what Khamenei is afraid of. Yet he\u2019s come this far.The 40th anniversary of the revolution, and the seizing of American hostages in Iran, is four years off. I\u2019d bet on the United States Embassy in Tehran reopening then. The ice has broken.Advertisement"}

According to The Associated Press, election officials said on Monday that Mr. Nazarbayev had taken 97.7 percent of the vote. The country\u2019s elections commission said turnout was higher than 95 percent.The election was called in February, seen as a move by Mr. Nazarbayev to win a vote of confidence as Kazakhstan, Central Asia\u2019s largest country, faces a daunting economic slowdown from the collapse in oil prices and regional instability because of the crisis in Ukraine.Mr. Nazarbayev, who has taken a title meaning \u201cfather of the nation,\u201d has built a cult of personality and created a political system with little room for dissent. The main intrigue in Sunday\u2019s vote was not who would win, but why the early election was held at all.\u201cThis has been quite a year for the Kazakhs,\u201d said Alexander A. Cooley, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Harriman Institute and an expert on Central Asia. \u201cIn times of political uncertainty, you reaffirm some traditional moorings and foundations of the political system.\u201dMr. Nazarbayev will receive his new mandate as Kazakhstan\u2019s growth is expected to stall from the slowdown in the Russian economy and cut-rate oil prices. In January, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development cut the country\u2019s growth outlook for 2015 to just 1.5 percent from 5.1 percent. Prices for consumer goods are rising, producers are having trouble competing with Russian rivals and the Central Bank is rumored to be considering a new devaluation of the tenge, the national currency. (The tenge lost 19 percent of its value in a single day in a devaluation last year.)\u201cI think the government was concerned that if the economy goes down, then there could be a protest electorate,\u201d said Nargis Kassenova, the director of the Central Asian Studies Center at Kimep University in Almaty, the country\u2019s largest city. \u201cSo to have nice figures, to get really good numbers for the leadership without manipulating the vote too much, I think they held the vote this year.\u201dThe fallout from the conflict in Ukraine has left Kazakhstan wary about the potential of its neighbor Russia to sow discord among the country\u2019s ethnic Russian minority, who make up a quarter of the population.The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, sent a chill through the Kazakh political elite last August, when asked whether a \u201cUkraine scenario\u201d of revolution and regional separatism could play out in Kazakhstan.Mr. Putin lavished backhanded praise on Mr. Nazarbayev, suggesting that the aging leader \u201cwould never go against the will of his own people.\u201d\u201cHe created a government on a territory where there was never government before,\u201d Mr. Putin added in his remarks. \u201cThe Kazakhs had never had government. He created it.\u201d\u201cOn the one hand, this is how he stays in power because people don\u2019t see an alternative,\u201d Ms. Kassenova said. \u201cBut on the other hand, what\u2019s next? There is a great deal of uncertainty.\u201d\u201cThis remains the main condition for the sustainable development of our country and completing the large-scale tasks of modernizing our economy and society,\u201d Mr. Nazarbayev said, favoring a gradual approach.As he left a polling booth after voting on Sunday, Mr. Nazarbayev said he was \u201cconfident that Kazakhstanis will vote for stability in our state.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economists Actually Agree on This: The Wisdom of Free Trade", "Date": "2015-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIf Congress were to take an exam in Economics 101, would it pass? We are about to find out. House and Senate committees approved versions of the legislation last week. But with influential lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, opposed to the measure, final congressional approval is far from certain.We wrote, \u201cInternational trade is fundamentally good for the U.S. economy, beneficial to American families over time, and consonant with our domestic priorities. That is why we support the renewal of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to make it possible for the United States to reach international agreements with our economic partners in Asia through the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and in Europe through the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).\u201dAccording to Smith, \u201cit is the maxim of every prudent master of a family never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy.\u201d Just as no sensible person tries to make all his own clothes and grow all his own food, he said, no sensible nation will aim to achieve prosperity by isolating itself from other nations around the world. Smith turned this perspective on its head. A nation benefits from imports, he argued, because they expand its opportunities for consumption. Exports are necessary only because other nations have the temerity to want to be paid for the goods they provide.Fetishism about gold is now rare, but a new form of mercantilism pervades the modern debate about trade. Politicians and pundits often recoil at imports because they destroy domestic jobs, while they applaud exports because they create jobs. Economists respond that full employment is possible with any pattern of trade. The main issue is not the number of jobs, but which jobs. Americans should work in those industries in which we have an advantage compared with other nations, and we should import from abroad those goods that can be produced more cheaply there.Mr. Caplan argues that voters are worse than ignorant about the principles of good policy. Ignorance would be random and might average out in a large population. Instead of being merely ignorant, voters hold on to mistaken beliefs.Politicians, whose main goal is to get elected, mold those mistaken beliefs into bad policy. Mr. Caplan writes: \u201cWhat happens if fully rational politicians compete for the support of irrational voters \u2014 specifically, voters with irrational beliefs about the effects of various policies? It is a recipe for mendacity.\u201dIn the case of international trade, three biases that he identifies are most salient.The second is an anti-market bias. People tend to underestimate the benefits of the market mechanism as a guide to allocating resources. Yet history has taught repeatedly that the alternative \u2014 a planned economy \u2014 works poorly.The third is a make-work bias. People tend to underestimate the benefit from conserving on labor and thus worry that imports will destroy jobs in import-competing industries. Yet long-run economic progress comes from finding ways to reduce labor input and redeploying workers to new, growing industries.The debate about international trade is a case in point. In the coming weeks, members of Congress will have an opportunity to prove Mr. Blinder wrong. Let\u2019s hope they take it.N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Working, but Needing Public Assistance Anyway", "Date": "2015-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA home health care worker in Durham, N.C.; a McDonald\u2019s cashier in Chicago; a bank teller in New York; an adjunct professor in Maywood, Ill. They are all evidence of an improving economy, because they are working and not among the steadily declining ranks of the unemployed.\u201cThis is a hidden cost of low-wage work,\u201d said Ken Jacobs, chairman of the Berkeley center and a co-author of the report, which is scheduled for release on Monday.Taxpayers pick up the difference, he said, between what employers pay and what is required to cover what most Americans consider essential living costs.The report estimates that state and federal governments spend more than $150 billion a year on four key antipoverty programs used by working families: Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps and the earned-income tax credit, which is specifically aimed at working families.This disparity has helped propel the movement to raise the minimum wage and prompted efforts in a handful of states to recover public funds from employers of low-wage workers. In Connecticut, for example, a legislative proposal calls for large employers to pay a fee to the state for each worker who earns less than $15 an hour. In 2016, California will start publishing the names of employers that have more than 100 employees receiving Medicaid, and how much these companies cost the state in public assistance.Adriana Alvarez, a cashier at a McDonald\u2019s in Chicago, is among the people pushing for higher wages. After five years with the fast-food giant, Ms. Alvarez, 22, earns $10.50 an hour, well above the federal minimum wage of $7.25. Still, she depends on food stamps, Medicaid and a child-care subsidy to help get through the week.\u201cHe eats a lot,\u201d Ms. Alvarez said of her 3-year-old son, Manny, with a laugh. He also drinks a lot of milk, she said \u2014 \u201ca half-gallon every two days\u201d \u2014 and because he is lactose intolerant, he requires a more expensive brand, using up most of her $80 allotment of food stamps.Most everyone else she works with \u2014 including many 10-year-plus veterans of the franchise \u2014 receives food stamps, said Ms. Alvarez, who started working at McDonald\u2019s full time when she was in high school.She depends on Medicaid for her family\u2019s health care, and receives a subsidy for the day care center where she drops off Manny on her way to work.With the recovery now well into its sixth year, stagnant wages have increasingly become the central economic issue and a political flash point.William E. Spriggs, chief economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the McDonald\u2019s announcement was \u201ca response to worker campaigns to increase the minimum wage and what is going on in legislatures on the state and local levels.\u201dDenise Rush, a home health care worker in Durham, N.C., often works seven days a week, returning home near midnight after her two teenagers have already gone to bed. At $9.50 an hour, her biweekly paycheck totals just over $700, or the cost of her monthly rent. There is little left for other expenses.\u201cIt\u2019s a crazy dilemma,\u201d she said. \u201cDo I pay the whole bill or do I gas up the car to go to work?\u201dDespite receiving coverage for her children\u2019s health care from Medicaid as well as about $300 a month in food stamps, Ms. Rush, 41, is still struggling. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about basic needs,\u201d she said, including such staples of modern life as a cellphone to keep in touch with work and her children and a home Internet connection to allow her children to do their homework.Her paycheck also fails to pay for the uniforms and fees for the lacrosse, basketball and soccer teams that Ms. Rush says she believes are essential to keep her son and daughter occupied and out of trouble while she is working. Fortunately, she said, the school has helped pick up that tab.About 48 percent of home health care workers are on public assistance, the Berkeley researchers found. So are 46 percent of child care workers and 52 percent of fast-food workers.Even some of the nation\u2019s best-educated workers have turned to taxpayers for support; a quarter of the families of part-time college faculty members are on public assistance, the Berkeley researchers found.\u201cI\u2019m very proud of my doctorate, it was well-earned, but in terms of the work force, it\u2019s a penalty,\u201d said Wanda Brewer, who lives in Maywood, a Chicago suburb, and teaches at DeVry and Concordia colleges. She is paid $2,700 for each 15-week course she teaches. She and her 4-year-old daughter are both on Medicaid; they also receive $390 a month in food stamps and a child care subsidy.She has applied for other jobs at chains like Walmart, Home Depot and Menard\u2019s, but says she can\u2019t even get a call back because such employers consider her overqualified.\u201cWhen I apply for anything outside education, they laugh at me,\u201d Ms. Brewer said. \u201cThe term professor immediately commands respect. The assumption is you\u2019re making a fair wage, a living wage, but that is not necessarily so.\u201dAn article on Monday about the hidden costs of low wages misstated the name of the Chicago suburb where Wanda Brewer, a part-time college teacher who receives Medicaid and food stamps, lives. It is Maywood \u2014 not Mayfield, which is a township.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Judges Skeptical of Challenge to Proposed E.P.A. Rule on Climate Change", "Date": "2015-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe plaintiffs in two cases before the court, Murray Energy Corporation v. E.P.A. and West Virginia v. E.P.A., say that as states prepare to meet the requirements, their moves are already wreaking economic havoc. They also say that once finalized, the rule will not stand up to additional legal challenges.These plaintiffs \u2014 14 states and the coal companies \u2014 contend that the agency lacks the authority to issue the regulation. In a highly unusual move, they have petitioned the court to block it from finalizing the proposed rule.Two of the three judges on the panel, Thomas B. Griffith and Brett M. Kavanaugh, appeared highly skeptical of the coal companies\u2019 efforts to stop the regulation before it was final, noting that there was no legal precedent for such an effort.\u201cDo you know of any case in which we\u2019ve halted a proposed rule-making?\u201d Judge Griffith asked. \u201cWhy in the world would we resort to extraordinary writ, which we\u2019ve never used before?\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s a proposed rule. We could guess what the final rule will be. But we\u2019re not in the business of guessing. We typically wait to see what the final rule will be.\u201dElbert Lin, the solicitor general of West Virginia, responded that states and utilities were being hurt as they began to restructure their energy systems in anticipation of the rule. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen a program like this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about fundamentally reordering the way we use energy, from plant to plug.\u201dHe added, \u201cThere are ongoing harms incurred by the states which cannot be adequately addressed.\u201dJudge Kavanaugh, noting that the E.P.A. has said it intends to revise the rule before releasing a final version, said: \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll still tweak it. For us to get in the middle of it before it happens seems highly unusual.\u201dJudge Kavanaugh also appeared skeptical of the argument that preparations could harm states in the handful of months before the rule is expected to be finalized this summer. \u201cIt could take as much time for us to write this opinion as it will for E.P.A. to release the final rule,\u201d he said.By requiring states to enact new policies to change their energy economies, Mr. Tribe told the court, \u201cthe E.P.A. is coloring outside the lines. They\u2019re trying to make law, not execute law. They are commandeering the states.\u201d\u201cStates are not to be treated as puppets,\u201d he added.Mr. Tribe also engaged in the narrow legal argument over two ambiguously worded amendments to the 1990 Clean Air Act that is at the heart of the dispute between the E.P.A. and the coal companies.Under those amendments, legal experts say, it is not clear whether the agency has the authority to use one section of the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas pollution from power plants when it has already used a different section of the law to regulate other kinds of pollutants from the plants.When the law was passed, the House version appeared to prohibit such \u201cdouble regulation,\u201d experts say, but the Senate version appeared to allow it. The final version of the legislation left the matter unclear.In arguing that it has the authority to regulate different pollutants from the same sources, the E.P.A. points to the Senate language. In arguing that the agency lacks the authority, the coal companies point to the House language.Mr. Tribe argued that a constitutional reading of the law would not give weight to the language that appears to allow double regulation.\u201cThey\u2019ve tried to create the illusion that there are two different provisions you have to reconcile,\u201d Mr. Tribe said. That reading, he said, \u201cwould upturn the entire constitutional system.\u201dAmanda Berman, representing the E.P.A., told the judges, \u201cI think he\u2019s flat-out wrong.\u201d She cited legal precedent in which, if there is ambiguity in a law, the agency enacting the law is given deference to interpret it.\u201cE.P.A. should be given the chance to reconcile these amendments,\u201d Ms. Berman said.The third judge on the panel, Karen L. Henderson, who said she held a different view from her colleagues, appeared less inclined to wait for the final regulation. She noted that the E.P.A. administrator, Gina McCarthy, had frequently said that she intended to finalize the rule much as it stands now. \u201cI see a closed mind as far as the legal issue,\u201d Judge Henderson said. \u201cThey\u2019ve already stated their position on the legality, unless a court says they\u2019re wrong.\u201dIt was less clear where the three judges, who were all appointed by Republican presidents, stood on the merits of the rule itself. If the panel dismisses the case because the regulation is not yet finalized, the petitioners are expected to return to the court once the final version is released.While those broader questions of constitutionality were not at issue in Thursday\u2019s case, they are almost certain to re-emerge.Thirteen states and the District of Columbia are backing the Obama administration\u2019s proposal.Advertisement"}

The meeting underway in Panama City, however, has the potential to deliver more than the sort of drama and rhetoric that has dominated previous summit meetings. Policy initiatives advanced by the Obama administration have opened multiple opportunities to engage differently and more robustly with neighbors that have long felt neglected, and in some instances slighted, by Washington. Clearly, the most dramatic of these initiatives has been the sweeping overhaul of American policy toward Cuba announced by Mr. Obama in December. Beyond that, there are other concrete steps the administration can take to strengthen its standing in the region. Mr. Obama\u2019s effort to shield certain immigrants from deportation through executive action and his administration\u2019s initiative to substantially increase aid for Central America has earned him significant good will in Latin America. But there are relationships with Latin American nations that remain unnecessarily strained.

{"Headline": "Zombies of 2016", "Date": "2015-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast week, a zombie went to New Hampshire and staked its claim to the Republican presidential nomination. Well, O.K., it was actually Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. But it\u2019s pretty much the same thing.But let us not be too harsh on Mr. Christie. A deep attachment to long-refuted ideas seems to be required of all prominent Republicans. Whoever finally gets the nomination for 2016 will have multiple zombies as his running mates.Start with Mr. Christie, who thought he was being smart and brave by proposing that we raise the age of eligibility for both Social Security and Medicare to 69. Doesn\u2019t this make sense now that Americans are living longer?And there are plenty of other zombies out there. Consider, for example, the zombification of the debate over health reform. So how has this changed the discourse? On the right, not at all. As far as I can tell, every prominent Republican talks about Obamacare as if all the predicted disasters have, in fact, come to pass.Finally, one of the interesting political developments of this election cycle has been the triumphant return of voodoo economics, the \u201csupply-side\u201d claim that tax cuts for the rich stimulate the economy so much that they pay for themselves. In the world of Republican politics, however, voodoo\u2019s grip has never been stronger. Would-be presidential candidates must audition in front of prominent supply-siders to prove their fealty to failed doctrine. Tax proposals like Marco Rubio\u2019s would create a giant hole in the budget, then claim that this hole would be filled by a miraculous economic upsurge. Supply-side economics, it\u2019s now clear, is the ultimate zombie: no amount of evidence or logic can kill it.So why has the Republican Party experienced a zombie apocalypse? One reason, surely, is the fact that most Republican politicians represent states or districts that will never, ever vote for a Democrat, so the only thing they fear is a challenge from the far right. Another is the need to tell Big Money what it wants to hear: a candidate saying anything realistic about Obamacare or tax cuts won\u2019t survive the Sheldon Adelson/Koch brothers primary.Whatever the reasons, the result is clear. Pundits will try to pretend that we\u2019re having a serious policy debate, but, as far as issues go, 2016 is already set up to be the election of the living dead. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ben Bernanke Will Work With Citadel, a Hedge Fund, as an Adviser", "Date": "2015-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor eight years, Ben S. Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, was steward of the world\u2019s largest economy. Now he has signed on to advise one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest hedge funds.Mr. Bernanke will become a senior adviser to Citadel, the $25 billion hedge fund founded by the billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin. He will offer his analysis of global economic and financial issues to Citadel\u2019s investment committees. He will also meet with Citadel\u2019s investors around the globe.It is the latest and most prominent move by a Washington insider through the revolving door into the financial industry. Investors are increasingly looking for guidance on how to navigate an uncertain economic environment in the aftermath of the financial crisis and are willing to pay top dollar to former officials like Mr. Bernanke.Mr. Bernanke joins a long parade of colleagues and peers to Wall Street and investment firms. After stepping down, Mr. Bernanke\u2019s predecessor, Alan Greenspan, was recruited as a consultant for Deutsche Bank, the bond investment firm Pacific Investment Management Company and the hedge fund Paulson & Company.In an interview, Mr. Bernanke said he was sensitive to the public\u2019s anxieties about the \u201crevolving door\u201d between Wall Street and Washington and chose to go to Citadel, in part, because it \u201cis not regulated by the Federal Reserve and I won\u2019t be doing lobbying of any sort.\u201dHe added that he had been recruited by banks but declined their offers. \u201cI wanted to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest,\u201d he said. \u201cI ruled out any firm that was regulated by the Federal Reserve.\u201dAfter stepping down last year, Mr. Bernanke hit the speaking circuit, attending dinners and conferences for hedge fund managers like David A. Tepper of Appaloosa Management, private equity executives like Michael E. Novogratz of the Fortress Investment Group and other financial institutions. At the Fed, Mr. Bernanke made $200,000 a year, a sum he can now make in a single speaking engagement.While Mr. Bernanke declined to disclose his compensation, he said he would be paid an annual fee but would not own a stake in the firm or receive a bonus based on its performance. His arrangement with Citadel is not exclusive, so he could take on other consulting roles. Mr. Bernanke said that he could not determine exactly how much time he expected to devote to Citadel.He added that he did not consider himself an investor; he plans to offer Citadel his perspective on monetary issues and other matters of public policy that Citadel will use as \u201cinputs\u201d into its investment decisions.\u201cI was looking for an opportunity to use my skills and knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an interesting firm.\u201dIn a statement, Mr. Griffin said: \u201cWe are honored to welcome Dr. Bernanke to Citadel. He has extraordinary knowledge of the global economy and his insights on monetary policy and the capital markets will be extremely valuable to our team and to our investors.\u201dSome of Wall Street\u2019s richest firms, including private equity and hedge funds, are hiring former central bankers, policy makers and regulators for top positions as they seek to gain an edge in an increasingly competitive and challenging market.David H. McCormick, a former under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs in the Bush administration, is now co-president of Bridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, with $150 billion of assets under management.\u201cIt is inevitable, if you are a bright, knowledgeable, battle-trained regulator or top-level player,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business of the University of Michigan. \u201cIt takes a really unusual public servant to be able to decline the siren song of making a lot of money.\u201dWhile Mr. Bernanke will remain a full-time fellow at the Brookings Institution, the new role represents his first somewhat regular job in the private sector since stepping down as Fed chairman in January 2014.Mr. Bernanke\u2019s insights are already much in demand.At a gathering at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas last May, several hedge fund managers said they had attended dinners with Mr. Bernanke in the first months after he stepped down from the Fed.\u201cAt those dinners he gave credence to the idea that the Fed believed in lower potential G.D.P. and lower potential inflation,\u201d Mr. Novogratz told the audience of money managers. For many, that advice was well worth the cost of a seat at the time.But one hedge fund manager missed out.\u201dHe gave this stuff out,\u201d Mr. Tepper said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t realize what he was saying at the time, so I didn\u2019t do a great trade.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The False Hope of a Limited Government, Built on Tax Breaks", "Date": "2015-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneIn the early years of the Reagan Revolution, Senator Robert Packwood, then the powerful Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, offered a robust \u2014 if unusual \u2014 defense of the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance: It prevented the government from getting bigger.\u201cThe one reason we do not have any significant demand for national health insurance in this country among those who are employed is because their employers are paying for their benefits,\u201d he argued. \u201cI hate to see us nibble at it for fear you are going to have the demand that the federal government take over and provide the benefits that would otherwise be lost.\u201dThis reasoning drives American policy making to this day. Whether he realized it or not, Mr. Packwood was effectively explaining why the United States has, alone among advanced nations, built a government on the idea of keeping the government at bay.But though the health insurance tax break has since grown into the nation\u2019s costliest tax expenditure, it is only one of many. Tax deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions were born with the income tax code in 1913. The government later added breaks for retirement savings. More recently, the earned-income tax credit for the working poor was created in 1975 and broadly expanded by President Bill Clinton with his first budget. In response to the rising cost of higher education, Washington provided a deduction for college tuition.In her book \u201cDegrees of Inequality\u201d published last year, Suzanne Mettler, professor of government at Cornell University, quotes Dick Morris, President Clinton\u2019s campaign adviser, defending the political superiority of tax benefits against the advice of the White House\u2019s top economic advisers.\u201cPolitically, people want us to downsize government,\u201d he argued, \u201cso we are developing ways of cutting taxes but achieving social good at the same time.\u201dBuilt in the shadows, protected from democratic accountability, the government developed into a Rube Goldberg contraption that has only a weak claim to a defensible social purpose. It might not be the smallest government in the advanced world, but it can lay claim to being among the least efficient and the most unfair.Interestingly, this suggests that the idea animating most liberal Democrats these days \u2014 that government must tax and spend more to provide the generous social insurance that is common among America\u2019s peers \u2014 might be wrong.Indeed, looked at this way, the government might actually be big enough. But if the United States is to moderate the extreme inequities thrown up by the market economy and provide a true safety net to people in need, the federal government would have to tax and spend very differently.By conventional measures, public social spending in the United States \u2014 defined as what the government spends directly to help people get through hard times like illness, unemployment or old age \u2014 ranks significantly below the average among the other 33 industrialized countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.In 2011, social spending from all levels of government amounted to 19 percent of gross domestic product, about three percentage points less than in Norway and 11 points less than in Denmark.But including both taxes on government benefits, which tend to be higher in other countries, and the cost of tax subsidies like the deduction for company-provided health insurance, American public spending on social insurance rises to almost 21 percent of G.D.P.That is above the O.E.C.D. average, ahead of Norway and no longer that far behind Denmark.And this doesn\u2019t even count government spending on education above the age of 6, which the O.E.C.D. considers an investment rather than social insurance, nor the costly mortgage tax deduction, which provides the vast bulk of its benefit to the most affluent households.At bottom, the American government\u2019s approach to taxing and spending is mildly progressive, but basically an impotent weapon against inequality.According to Mr. Kirkegaard\u2019s calculations, the disposable income gap between families at the top 10 percent and those at the bottom 10 percent of the income distribution, after taxes and government transfers, is bigger in the United States than in any other O.E.C.D. nations except Mexico, Turkey and Israel.\u201cThe main thing here is not about not spending enough,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard said. \u201cIt is about the distribution of this spending.\u201dFor most voters, however, it\u2019s just too hard to tell how much the government spends on these priorities and when the playing field is tilted toward those at the top. \u201cJust from a democratic transparency perspective, this is a huge problem,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard said.And the inefficiency of American social insurance manifests itself across the board.But their plans fail to recognize that Americans actually prefer a strong safety net. In fact, counting private expenditures along with public ones, the United States spends more on social insurance than every O.E.C.D. country but France.In light of these preferences, perhaps it is time to stop focusing so much on the visible part of government. Instead, Washington might be better occupied culling the many goodies hidden in the tax code that serve little or no social purpose other than coddling well-connected constituencies. Those billions could then be used to provide regular American families the social insurance they really need.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cellphones for Women in Developing Nations Aid Ascent From Poverty", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayHere is what life is like for a woman with no bank account in a developing country. She keeps her savings hidden \u2014 in pots, under mattresses, in fields. She constantly worries about thieves. She may even worry about her husband taking cash she has budgeted for their children\u2019s needs. Sending money to a family member in another village is risky and can take days. Obtaining a loan in an emergency is often impossible. An unexpected expense can mean she has to pull a child out of school or sell a cow the family relies on for income. Or, worse, it can mean she must give birth at home without medical assistance because she doesn\u2019t have the money for a ride to a clinic. In ways big and small, life without access to financial services is more difficult, expensive and dangerous. It constrains a woman\u2019s ability to plan for her family\u2019s future. At the community level, it traps households in cycles of poverty. More broadly, it limits the economic growth potential of developing countries. So it is not hard to understand why the spread of new digital financial services to the world\u2019s poorest places has been heralded as a breakthrough with the potential to alter the global economy. Digital financial services offer the world a huge chance to connect more than two billion people to their first bank accounts, lift millions of families out of poverty and accelerate the participation of developing countries in the global marketplace. But this vision of the future won\u2019t materialize on its own. Unless we make a course correction, it won\u2019t materialize at all. For digital financial services to achieve their full impact, we must be deliberate about ensuring that these services are reaching an especially crucial group of economic actors in developing economies: women.Even though this technology is spreading rapidly, it is not spreading to women equally. Consider Bangladesh, where four out of five people do not have traditional bank accounts. Thanks to fast-growing digital financial services companies like bKash, mobile money is transforming the way Bangladesh does business. Yet only 44 percent of Bangladeshi women own mobile phones, compared with 72 percent of Bangladeshi men. And as a result, only 13 percent of Bangladeshi women have used mobile money, compared with 33 percent of Bangladeshi men. Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists try to resist Wall Street\u2019s entreaties, but a new relationship has lead to new fund-raising methods.Women make up half the population. So it is obviously a huge wasted opportunity whenever women are isolated from the economy. However, when women are empowered as economic actors, the benefits touch everyone. Economically empowered women are one of the most important engines of growth in developing countries, and they play a central role in building prosperous communities. When women have access to digital financial services, it is easier for them to invest in the future of their families. That benefits everyone, because healthier, more educated children today mean healthier, more prosperous communities tomorrow. So how do we get more of this technology to more women? One thing we need is more information about why women are less likely to own mobile phones or use mobile money services. This month, the World Bank will release the Global Financial Inclusion Database, or Global Findex, report. This report will provide new insights into women\u2019s use of digital financial services and help improve our understanding of how to close the gaps that remain. The Group of 20 industrial nations are also trying to better understand how digital payments can empower female entrepreneurs and bring more women into the formal economy. In the meantime, governments, nonprofit organizations and the private sector are working together to dismantle the barriers we already know exist \u2014 like committing to digital payroll and social service payments and exploring creative financing options to help make cellphones more affordable for women. A decade from now, economies in developing countries will be increasingly dependent on digital financial services. Will we limit growth for everyone by leaving the world\u2019s poorest women trapped in a shrinking cash economy? Or will we invest in our future by empowering these women to invest in theirs?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economics and Elections", "Date": "2015-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet as Britain prepares to go to the polls, the leaders of the coalition government that has ruled the country since 2010 are posing as the guardians of prosperity, the people who really know how to run the economy. And they are, by and large, getting away with it. There are some important lessons here, not just for Britain but for all democracies struggling to manage their economies in difficult times. I\u2019ll get to those lessons in a minute. But first, let\u2019s ask how a British government with such a poor economic record can manage to run on its supposed economic achievements.Well, you could blame the weakness of the opposition, which has done an absolutely terrible job of making its case. You could blame the fecklessness of the news media, which has gotten much wrong. But the truth is that what\u2019s happening in British politics is what almost always happens, there and everywhere else: Voters have fairly short memories, and they judge economic policy not by long-term results but by recent growth. Over five years, the coalition\u2019s record looks terrible. But over the past couple of quarters it looks pretty good, and that\u2019s what matters politically. This is, if you think about it, a distressing result, because it says that there is little or no political reward for good policy. A nation\u2019s leaders may do an excellent job of economic stewardship for four or five years yet get booted out because of weakness in the last two quarters before the election. In fact, the evidence suggests that the politically smart thing might well be to impose a pointless depression on your country for much of your time in office, solely to leave room for a roaring recovery just before voters go to the polls.Actually, that\u2019s a pretty good description of what the current British government has done, although it\u2019s not clear that it was deliberate.The point, then, is that elections \u2014 which are supposed to hold politicians accountable \u2014 don\u2019t seem to fulfill that function very well when it comes to economic policy. But can anything be done about this weakness?One possible answer, which appeals to many pundits, might be to remove economic policy making from the political sphere and turn it over to nonpartisan elite commissions. This presumes, however, that elites know what they are doing \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to see what, in recent events, might make you believe that. After all, American elites spent years in the thrall of Bowles-Simpsonism, a completely misplaced obsession over budget deficits. European elites, with their commitment to punitive austerity, have been even worse.So reporting on economic issues could and should be vastly better. But political scientists would surely scoff at the idea that this would make much difference to election outcomes, and they\u2019re probably right.What, then, should those of us who study economic policy and care about real-world outcomes do? The answer, surely, is that we should do our jobs: Try to get it right, and explain our answers as clearly as we can. Realistically, the political impact will usually be marginal at best.

With the Fed\u2019s John Williams: Timing of Rate Rise Is Overrated", "Date": "2015-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyJohn Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, says he\u2019s done talking about which month the Fed will start to raise its benchmark interest rate.\u201cI\u2019ve sworn to myself that from now on the only months of the year I\u2019ll refer to is months that have reference to births and anniversaries,\u201d he said in an interview this week.But Mr. Williams did offer a specific answer about the timing of that first increase: He will vote to raise rates, he said, when he expects unemployment to fall to its minimum sustainable level within the next year, and inflation to rise to 2 percent within the next two years.He also offered his thoughts on the great debate between Ben Bernanke and Larry Summers, and the consequences for monetary policy.The transcript of our conversation was lightly edited for clarity.Assuming energy prices stabilize and import prices go back to not being as significant a source of downward pressure, and with the growth that I projected and the improvement in the labor market I projected, I expect us to be back at full employment late this year or early next year. And my view based on the evidence of the past several business cycles is that when you push the unemployment rate down, you push the economy to the point where the labor market is stronger than normal, that\u2019s going to create wage pressures in the labor market and be one of the factors that pushes inflation back to 2 percent. I have confidence because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in previous business cycles.This is a typical Fed belts-and-suspenders approach. We\u2019re not exactly sure how interest rates will behave and so we want to make sure that we have the full set of tools and programs so that we can make sure we can conduct monetary policy. To my mind it\u2019s a lot of contingency planning and thinking through various options, and that\u2019s what we should be doing. I don\u2019t know why one would be critical of that.If you really think we\u2019re going to have an equilibrium interest rate of 1 percent, operating monetary policy in a normal way will be very problematic. Your buffer goes to 300 or maybe 200 basis points. If you really thought that\u2019s the world we\u2019re in because of the demographics or productivity growth \u2014 if that\u2019s really what our future holds \u2014 I think that\u2019s just a reality that you need to think about monetary policy and its ability to achieve goals. Is the 2 percent inflation goal sufficiently high in that kind of world? These are the kinds of issues that you have to take seriously if the secular stagnation view is right.I\u2019m really kind of excited about the research that can be done around these issues. Not just to answer is Larry Summers right or is Ben Bernanke right but to understand how the economy works more generally. There are a lot of fascinating issues about how demographics affect the economy\u2019s development that we haven\u2019t in the past studied so much. Japan always brings this up: that demographics is the most important factor in their macroeconomy. As a U.S. economist, that always seemed like a nuisance parameter and now we are seeing that the demographic wave is so big that it\u2019s an important area to understand how that affects growth and productivity and fiscal issues and even monetary policy. So I think we have a lot to learn about that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Afghan Weddings, His Side, Her Side and 600 Strangers", "Date": "2015-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKabul JournalKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 When Shafiqullah walked into his wedding celebration, he was surprised to find 600 extra people in the room, none of whom he recognized.Still, he knew his obligations.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t serve them, it would have caused me dishonor and taken away all happiness from my wedding day,\u201d explained Shafiqullah, a genial 31-year-old car salesman.So he told the caterers at the Kabul wedding hall he had rented to double the food order, bringing the cost of his wedding to nearly $30,000 \u2014 a small fortune in this impoverished country.It is a familiar tale in Afghanistan, where weddings are vital demonstrations of two tightly held values: commitment to hospitality and devotion to family and community.But the strain of having to host a party the size of a small village \u2014 or two small villages if strangers turn up, as they often do \u2014 is proving ruinous for many young Afghan men, who find themselves taking out loans to get married that will take years to pay back.Enter the Afghan Parliament, which recently took aim at Kabul\u2019s wedding-industrial complex, as typified by the gargantuan and garish wedding halls that have increasingly flooded this capital\u2019s night skies with neon over the past decade. With the fervent support of young Kabul residents, lawmakers passed a bill to cap the number of wedding guests at such establishments to 500 people. It is awaiting final approval.In many countries, young couples might struggle to find 500 guests to celebrate with them. Afghans have no such problem.Consider Shafiqullah\u2019s original guest list of 700 for his wedding six months ago. Besides the guests on his bride\u2019s side, Shafiqullah invited \u201cmy cousins; my cousin\u2019s cousins; my neighbors; also people who live in the surrounding areas; and, of course, people from my village, the one I came from before Kabul; and 100 to 150 colleagues, other car salesmen.\u201dBut among the 1,300 gathered, he strained to pick them out from the strangers. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize more than half of the guests in the male section,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was amazing, but also disturbing as these were people I had never seen before in my entire life.\u201dEven so, he ruefully noted this month, \u201cI still have some friends who are complaining that I did not invite them to the wedding.\u201dThe crowds that stream into Kabul\u2019s wedding halls each night have given rise to a subculture of \u201ctoi paal\u201d \u2014 wedding crashers. They are uninvited men who hang around the stretch of the airport road that has been nicknamed \u201cLas Vegas,\u201d for the bright neon lights and mirrored glass of the wedding halls. They show up in droves to places with names like Crystal or Evening of Paris, complete with a miniature Eiffel Tower, and City Star, with a glowing crescent several stories high.Because weddings are generally segregated by gender, usually by huge partitions, the draw is not the opportunity to meet women so much as it is the banquet fare of lamb, chicken, kabuli pulao (a traditional lamb pilaf), yogurt, fruit and pudding.Most young men in Kabul seem to know the expression, \u201cWith a wedding every night, there is no need to go hungry.\u201dPeople across Kabul still speak of the wedding several years ago of a vice president\u2019s second youngest son. Two of the capital\u2019s giant wedding halls, as well as two of its nicest hotels, were booked to accommodate the 4,000 to 7,000 guests, according to the lore among wedding hall owners.Young men whose fathers are not vice presidents are among the bill\u2019s most ardent supporters.\u201cI demand that the president sign this law,\u201d said Jawed, 24, who sells fabric in a small stall in an underground shopping mall. \u201cI beg him to sign this law as soon as possible so people like me can get married soon.\u201dIn some cases, the high cost of weddings has delayed marriages here for years.Ahmad Walid Sultani, who owns a stationery store, said he hopes someday to print invitations for his own wedding, not just for his customers\u2019 weddings. He has been engaged for seven long years while saving money \u201cfor all the extravagant expenses needed for a wedding.\u201dLike many young men in Kabul, he worries that his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family, which by tradition does not pay for the wedding, expects a bigger, more lavish party than he could afford. He has good cause: When his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s cousin was married recently, his future in-laws invited 1,500 people.\u201cI know that my in-laws are going to place a big burden on me at my wedding,\u201d he said.Though Mr. Sultani is already engaged, many young men first worry about finding a way to pay long before they start searching for a bride.\u201cI need to work hard and for a long time before I make enough money to marry someone,\u201d said Fayaz, 19, who sells bootleg DVDs in a traffic circle. He figured a wedding would cost him more than $8,500.To pay for such weddings, young men in Kabul seek loans from banks, siblings and an extended network of relatives. They swap stories about doomed marriages in which young grooms, shortly after their nuptials, go abroad to Iran or Dubai as migrant laborers to pay off the debt. The most popular versions of these urban legends have the husbands returning years later as drug addicts or not at all.Booking a wedding hall and feeding the guests account for only a fraction of the cost. Grooms must also buy gold jewelry for the bride. And they must pay what is known as a \u201cbride price,\u201d a certain sum the groom gives to the bride or her family so that she has some property of her own to control.The current bill has passed both houses of the Afghan Parliament, though with discrepancies \u2014 the lower house limited guests to 400, while the Senate put the cap at 500 \u2014 that need to be reconciled before it reaches the president\u2019s desk.The legislation faces opposition by women\u2019s rights leaders, wedding hall owners and the union of hotel workers, who plan to lobby President Ashraf Ghani to veto it.Shukria Barakzai, a member of Parliament, said she objected to requirements in the bill that wedding halls segregate parties by gender and inspect the bride\u2019s clothing for modesty. \u201cThis involves the privacy of life and fundamental rights of citizens,\u201d she said.The wedding hall owners have their own arguments. They say that forcing families to trim names from guest lists is not only an affront to Afghan values, but will only invite discord between families and weaken the social and tribal ties that undergird much of Afghan life.\u201cIf you don\u2019t invite us to your wedding, please don\u2019t expect us to shoulder your coffin, either,\u201d is how many Afghans will react to being excluded from weddings, said Hajji Ghulam Sadiq, the owner of Oranos wedding hall.Down the road, at the Sultan City wedding hall, one of the managers, wearing a black shirt and a pressed brown suit, said the new law would cripple the wedding hall business \u2014 one of the few thriving industries in an ailing Afghan economy.\u201cWhat will they do if they lose their jobs?\u201d said the manager, Sayed Yaqoot, referring to the thousands of waiters and wedding hall workers. \u201cGo join the Taliban?\u201dJawad Sukhanyar, Fazal Muzhary and Ahmad Shakib contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jobs Report Adds to Evidence of a Slowing Economy", "Date": "2015-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy the NumbersThis morning\u2019s disappointing employment report confirms what an array of economic indicators has been suggesting for some time: The economy is slowing.Over the past few months, consumption spending has been flat. Industrial production has fallen slightly. Real retail sales are down. And durable goods orders have fallen sharply. The latest readings of gross domestic product suggest a tepid rate of growth at the end of 2014, and tracking estimates point to continuing weakness at the start of 2015.Likewise, measures of sentiment among both consumers and businesses point to some degree of dissipating optimism.Against this background, it comes as little surprise to learn that recent reports of strong jobs growth had been overstated. The latest revisions say the economy is creating around 150,000 to 200,000 jobs per month, rather than the 250,000 to 300,000 that optimists had hoped for.One useful way of summarizing the flow of recent economic data is something called an economic surprise index. For each new piece of data that comes out, the index assesses whether it beat economists\u2019 expectations or not. Good news yields a positive score, and bad news yields a negative. The index scales each piece of news by how big a surprise it is, and how important the indicator, summing up surprises over the past three months.The latest readings of this index underscore the fact that, on average, the sum of economic data released so far through 2015 has tended to be worse than expected.I like to think of this as an index that tells economists how much they need to change their minds, and in what direction. And it says that it is time to revisit earlier optimism, and to warn about the possibility that the recovery may be at risk of stalling.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Words to Get Elected By, or So She Hopes", "Date": "2015-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From AmericaA feature of American politics today is that its protagonists tend to be rich. And so, when they leave the corridors of power for the campaign trail, they must reach for words that will help them connect with voters with whom, well, they have little in common.Election time is when you start to hear about \u201caverage people,\u201d \u201cworking families,\u201d \u201cpatriotic Americans\u201d and such.\u201cEveryday Americans\u201d is Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s lexical gambit as the former American secretary of state saunters into the 2016 presidential race. It\u2019s a casual, easy phrase, which is usually the sign of an enormous amount of worried focus-group research.The secret to such phrase-minting seems to rely on being mostly inclusive and a little exclusive. If the phrase was meant to refer to every American citizen, politicians would just say \u201cAmericans.\u201d Likewise, make it too exclusive \u2014 say, \u201cJesus-loving Americans\u201d \u2014 and it costs you the election. The key is to signal to every possible voter that you could be talking about them, but somehow, subliminally, to suggest that there are some people beneath the dignity of the term. \u201cPatriotic Americans\u201d is sort of understood to exclude liberal city slickers. \u201cWorking families\u201d quietly conveys an exclusion of welfare recipients that might play well with, say, white working-class voters.So whom does \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d include and exclude?The Oxford English Dictionary says that \u201ceveryday\u201d means \u201ccommonplace, mediocre, inferior.\u201d But it also denotes a pulse-like steadiness: \u201cEach day in continued succession.\u201d Among the synonyms Merriam-Webster gives are \u201cprosaic,\u201d \u201croutine\u201d and \u201cworkaday,\u201d in addition to the many about ordinariness. So if Mrs. Clinton is saying something even faintly distinctive in the phrase, it would seem to involve the settled nature, the constancy, that \u201ceveryday\u201d implies. It makes you think of people who march steadily through life, doing the things you\u2019re supposed to do: stay in school, graduate, land a steady job, marry once and forever, buy a house, start a small business, volunteer for the parent-teacher association, have kids, and retire securely.The curious thing is, this simple, steady American life is one ever fewer actual Americans are living. If the winners and the losers of our networked, digitizing, ultrafast age share one thing, it is in fact this flight from settled, stable routine. Consider just two aspects of life: where you live and what you do.More and more, the superrich don\u2019t live in one place but many, flitting between multiple homes on different continents, flying to them on private jets, perhaps, concealing many of their real estate purchases through webs of shell companies and trusts. Meanwhile, America\u2019s millennial generation is rejecting the settled homeowner\u2019s life for another reason: They can\u2019t afford it. A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that 30-year-olds in 2003 were twice as likely to own a home as to live with their parents. By 2013, the two scenarios had become equally likely.In the realm of work, the rich and poor share something else: increasing volatility in their incomes. A paper by the economists Jonathan A. Parker and Annette Vissing-Jorgensen analyzed how sensitive different types of workers are to national growth. They found that, as has long been true, the poor are more sensitive than the middle class, losing their jobs and seeing their hours cut whenever the economy tanks. What is new is that America\u2019s rich, too, have seen their incomes grow more volatile. The authors suggest that the same forces of globalization and technological change that have made the poor more easily dispensable have given the rich higher highs and lower lows.More and more, for their own reasons, America\u2019s winners and losers live lives not of constancy but of flux, never knowing what the future holds, living on the go. Only one of those populations lives like this out of choice, of course. The point, though, is that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d are a shrinking breed in an era that has proven rather unkind to the routine and the ordinary.Advertisement"}

Mr. Murdoch\u2019s companies are now housed at 1211 and 1185 Avenue of the Americas.The discussions on the trade center are shrouded in a confidentiality agreement, but several executives who have been briefed on the plans say both sides are spending an enormous amount of time and money assessing the feasibility of the project.Nathaniel Brown, a spokesman for 21st Century Fox, said on Friday that it and News Corporation \u201care each exploring options for their New York headquarters, and the process is ongoing.\u201dEven as the new trade center has taken shape, the surrounding neighborhood in Lower Manhattan has undergone a major transformation. The area, which 20 years ago often looked like a ghost town at the end of the work day, is now home to upscale restaurants, luxury retailers and more than 60,000 residents.But the industry\u2019s footprint has been shrinking steadily. One Wall Street, the Art Deco home of Irving Trust and Bank of New York Mellon, is being converted into luxury apartments, as are many other older downtown office towers. Chase Manhattan Plaza was sold to a Chinese company.Time Inc., and its stable of magazines and digital media properties, is moving to the five-building office complex that was once known as the World Financial Center. Merrill Lynch and Nomura, a Japanese financial firm, are gone from the complex, and its owners have renamed it Brookfield Place.The two companies have about 4,000 employees at their offices on Avenue of the Americas.Yet there are logistical issues at 2 World Trade Center, and the companies have a history of failing to pull the trigger on major real estate moves.In 2008, News Corporation was a partner and anchor tenant in a bid by the Related Companies to buy the West Side railyards for a 26-acre residential and commercial complex. Related effectively dropped out of the bidding a month before the final selection after a shaky economy led Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company to abandon the deal. Ultimately, Related did gain control of the railyards after the winning bidder refused to sign the deal.Even earlier, News Corporation negotiated for six months in 1989 with the developer David Solomon to be the anchor tenant for a 42-story tower under construction at the north end of Times Square. The two sides failed to come to terms; Mr. Solomon tumbled into bankruptcy and lost his building.The talks at the trade center began earlier this year. Initially, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s companies had wanted to gain control of the site from Mr. Silverstein and build a smaller tower designed by their own architect. That proved undoable for various reasons.The companies are now talking about taking about half of the building \u2014 1.5 million square feet \u2014 designed by Mr. Foster, but they still may bring in their own architect for the changes.Given that the foundation has been built, the two sides are assessing whether the structure can accommodate the changes they want for television studios.If it proves possible, it is still unclear what kind of subsidy deal News Corporation and 21st Century Fox would want from the Port Authority, the city and the state. Generous sales tax breaks are available downtown, but there are no more tax-free Liberty Bonds, which were used to finance the other office towers at the trade center.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that the building at 4 World Trade Center was completed. It was finished in 2013, not last year.Advertisement"}

Doubts about China\u2019s economy did not stop its stocks from more than doubling in the last 12 months. The United States market has been lukewarm this year, but the excitement seemed back on Thursday, after three companies carried out initial stock public offerings that rose sharply on their first day of trading.But the good times evaporated on Friday. The day\u2019s moves weren\u2019t large by recent standards, but the global nature of the swoon gave traders and analysts pause. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 23.81, or 1.1 percent, to close at 2,081.18.The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 279.47 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 17,826.30. At one point in the day, it was down as much as 357 points. The Dow is more or less flat for the year and down about 2.5 percent from the high, not adjusted for inflation, that it reached last month. The Nasdaq composite index fell 75.98, or 1.5 percent, to 4,931.81.Chinese stock futures, which allow traders to bet on future movements in shares, plunged on Friday. The sell-off occurred after Chinese market regulators on Friday announced changes that could restrict the supply of loans that investors use to finance stock trades and increase the amount of negative bets against Chinese stocks.Germany\u2019s DAX index declined 2.58 percent. Adding a chill to the market on Friday, the yield on the 10-year German government bond fell to 0.08 percent.Investors flock to German government bonds during periods of nervousness, making people willing to accept such low returns. The yield on the United States 10-year Treasury note, another safe haven investment, fell to 1.87 percent from 1.90 late Thursday.Some analysts said the markets had looked vulnerable to a sell-off.As shares have risen, the valuations on companies have become more expensive, which can make investors less likely to hold them if earnings disappoint. Volatility in the markets has also dropped in recent weeks, suggesting that investors thought that the outlook for stocks and bonds was predictable.\u201cIf there is a news item, the market reacts because of this vulnerability,\u201d Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said.Plenty of challenges remain for investors.Greece\u2019s clashes over its debts with other European leaders are not likely to disappear. If Greece were to default and drop out of the euro, global markets might be in for a period of strong turbulence. But even if the country strikes a deal, it may be weeks before an agreement is forged. But shares of American Express fell 4.4 percent on Friday after the company reported earnings on Thursday after the markets closed. Those companies, Etsy, an online marketplace for artisanal products; Virtu Financial, a high-frequency trading firm; and Party City, a party supplies company, all traded substantially higher on Thursday. On Friday, the stocks of Virtu and Party City rose. But Etsy shares fell 8.1 percent. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Legacy of a South Korean Ferry Sinking", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJEJU, South Korea \u2014 At the windy port here on South Korea\u2019s most famous resort island, stevedores prepared a ferry for its four-and-a-half-hour journey to Mokpo in the country\u2019s southwest, chains clanking as they lashed trucks to the damp cargo deck. As truck drivers hauling cows, radishes and aluminum window frames inched their way to the front of the line, they did something they had never done before last year: They handed in paperwork certifying the weight of their cargo.\u201cIn the past, we didn\u2019t weigh trucks and we didn\u2019t know how much ships were carrying in cargo,\u201d said Oh Myung-o, an inspector in Jeju who is back on the job while he and four other inspectors from the island stand trial for failing to stop routine overloading. \u201cWe did not suspect the Sewol would do foul play with its ballast water. We were wrong.\u201dAs prosecutors later discovered, the Sewol was carrying twice its legal limit of cargo on its final voyage, having dumped most of the ballast water that would have helped stabilize it. The ferry operators got away with it because inspectors had limited themselves to monitoring many ships from shore; so long as vessels did not sit too low in the water, the inspectors raised no questions.The overloading helped doom the ferry when it made a sharp turn in dangerous currents. But it was just one of numerous regulatory sins so serious that the country\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye, vowed to untangle long-tolerated collusive ties with industry that many believe were at the heart of the tragedy.The sinking of the ferry Sewol was among South Korea\u2019s worst peacetime disasters and led to criminal convictions, the resignation of the country\u2019s prime minister and the death of the billionaire who owned the ferry.One year later, many safety experts and those working in the shipping industry say important changes have been made, including the passage of a law to ban government officials from taking expensive gifts and another to crack down on business owners whose companies are involved in major disasters. But government critics remain bitter, convinced Ms. Park\u2019s administration is more interested in moving past the tragedy that has threatened to become her biggest legacy than in undertaking a serious investigation of the disaster and bungled rescue. They cite recent safety lapses on ships as evidence of continued wrongdoing.Last weekend, thousands of people, including 70 of the Sewol victims\u2019 parents who shaved their heads in protest, marched in downtown Seoul to demand that a new investigation be opened.In what some saw as an effort to halt the criticism, Ms. Park \u2014 whose approval ratings have never recovered after the sinking \u2014 announced on Monday that her government would consider the costly task of raising the Sewol. The bodies of nine passengers \u2014 four of them high school students \u2014 have never been found.\u201cFor one year, we have been praying and begging to them to help find our loved ones,\u201d said Lee Keum-hui, the mother of a teenager whose body is still missing. \u201cBut nothing has changed for us.\u201dSouth Korea has long been known for its high tolerance of corruption in service of stoking its economy. Collusive ties between regulators and businesses have been blamed for building collapses, as well as rising fears about the country\u2019s nuclear power industry. In an attempt to address such corruption in the shipping industry, the government revised laws in recent months to stipulate harsher financial penalties and longer prison terms for ferry crews and companies that violate safety rules. Dozens of regulators, crew members, ship inspectors and officials with ferry and loading companies have been convicted or face trial for their roles in the Sewol disaster.\u201cAfter the Sewol, I was ashamed to tell people that I worked on a ferry,\u201d said Kim Young-jin, the captain of the Hanil Blue Narae, a car ferry that sails between Jeju and Wando, another island off the country\u2019s southern coast. \u201cWe now pay more attention to safety.\u201dLast month, the government announced a $27 billion safety plan that called for hiring more rescuers and safety supervisors, deploying bigger rescue ships and helicopters, and financing more training for ferry crews. (The first coast guard rescue boats arriving at the Sewol disaster had inadequate equipment and did little more than watch the ship slowly disappear beneath the waves as passengers trapped inside called for help through the windows.)But Park Jun-do, of the civic group People\u2019s Solidarity for Social Progress, said the government\u2019s safety measures were little more than \u201cwindow-dressing\u201d and fell far short of addressing deeply rooted corruption that is still undermining safety.In January, three months after the government required all trucks to weigh themselves at government-licensed measuring stations, JTBC, a local cable channel, discovered that some drivers loaded extra cargo after leaving the stations. As a result, the government is now conducting random inspections.And in an attempt to eradicate dangerous conflicts of interest, the government has said it would transfer pier-side inspectors like Mr. Oh from the Korea Shipping Association, which is financed by shipping companies, to a government-funded agency.But just last month, government auditors revealed that two officials from that agency had approved the illegal remodeling of two ships. (One of the many problems found with the Sewol, according to prosecutors, was that regulators allowed the ferry owners to add passenger berths to improve earnings, changes that made the ship top-heavy and vulnerable to tilting.)\u201cWhat we need most urgently, more than harsher punishments or retiring older ships,\u201d Mr. Kim said, \u201cis sailors who are proud of what they do and feel motivated and responsible.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If, as the polls suggest, neither the Conservatives nor the Labour Party emerges a clear victor next month, his Liberal Democrats may once again tilt the balance of power.\u201cThey could still decide the makeup of the next government,\u201d said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. As long as they hold enough seats to be mathematically useful, he said, the Liberal Democrats have a big advantage in coalition talks: Unlike some other smaller parties, they can work with either the Conservatives or Labour.Accordingly, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 pitch to voters is that they alone can restrain either side\u2019s excesses: keeping a Conservative government from cutting public spending too deeply, or a Labour government from borrowing too heavily.According to Professor Bale, the venom directed at Mr. Clegg, 48, comes both from those in the Labour Party who are angry at his alliance with Mr. Cameron and from right-wing Conservatives \u201cwho load everything they don\u2019t like about their party\u2019s participation in the coalition onto Clegg.\u201d\u201cPut that together with a manner that some people would describe as sanctimonious, and that\u2019s a lethal combination,\u201d Professor Bale said.Exactly how lethal will be decided in Sheffield Hallam, the Yorkshire constituency that Mr. Clegg represents. In 2010, he received over 15,000 more votes than the Conservative candidate here and over 19,000 more than Labour. But recent polls suggest that Labour, which has never represented the area, could win the seat this time.Oliver Coppard, the Labour candidate, says that his campaign is not a \u201cpersonal vendetta\u201d against Mr. Clegg, despite newspaper speculation about a \u201cdecapitation\u201d strategy aimed at the Liberal Democrats\u2019 leader. Still, Mr. Coppard calls Mr. Clegg someone \u201cwho has done very little for the city and let a lot of people down.\u201dUnlike Mr. Clegg, who lives in London, Mr. Coppard, 33, grew up and lives in Sheffield; local residence is not required but usually conveys an advantage at the polls. His campaign has also been helped by an influx of campaign contributions and eager student volunteers.In the Stannington suburb, a local voter, Mary Reast, was asked if she had supported Mr. Clegg in 2010. \u201cWe all did round here,\u201d she replied, but now, \u201cwe are very disillusioned \u2014 I don\u2019t think he\u2019s done anything for this area.\u201dThe coalition government\u2019s spending cuts have aroused opposition, though it is less strident now than it was a couple of years ago, when one protest poster portrayed the party leader as \u201cCleggzilla,\u201d a giant figure crushing the city underfoot.Ben Curran campaigned alongside Mr. Clegg in 2010, but left the Liberal Democrats later that year to join Labour, and is now a member of the Sheffield City Council. He said that by aligning with the Conservatives, Mr. Clegg betrayed the center-left platform on which he was elected.Mr. Curran said many voters backed the Liberal Democrats in 2010 hoping to keep the Conservatives out of power, not to align with them. \u201cI do feel incredibly let down,\u201d Mr. Curran added. \u201cA few years ago I would have said I was spitting feathers with anger.\u201dStill, Andrew Sangar, the head of the Liberal Democrats\u2019 campaign in the district, said he was \u201cconfident but not complacent\u201d about winning Sheffield Hallam. \u201cWe feel we have been doing enough, and that Nick Clegg has a good reputation in the constituency,\u201d he said.Olly Grender, a strategist for the Liberal Democrats, said the party was counting on sophisticated canvassing software and the power of incumbency to help it at the polls.\u201cWe have had a strategy in place for a long time now where we focus as many resources as possible onto our key seats,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are starting to listen to Nick and are more open-minded about him than in the first year of the coalition.\u201dMs. Grender noted that \u201che didn\u2019t have to go into government, but the economy would have been in a worse place if he hadn\u2019t.\u201dUnder Mr. Clegg\u2019s leadership, the Liberal Democrats have remained disciplined despite their plummeting popularity, and even some opponents acknowledge Mr. Clegg\u2019s resilience.During a recent meeting in London organized by the Mumsnet website, Mr. Clegg patiently fielded questions, including some on tuition fees.\u201cIf there is one policy that you don\u2019t do, that tends to be the one thing people remind you of,\u201d he said. But he insisted that, \u201cfar from feeling embarrassed by what the Lib Dems have done in government, we have stepped up to the plate and done, broadly, the right things with the right policies.\u201dAfterward he reflected on a harsh lesson he learned from five roller-coaster years at the heart of British politics.\u201cSmaller parties in coalitions tend to get the blame for the bad stuff,\u201d he said, \u201cand don\u2019t tend to get the credit for the good stuff.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Policy Makers Seem Cool to Rate Increase in June", "Date": "2015-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve is looking increasingly unlikely to start raising its benchmark interest rate in June.\u201cData has very much surprised to the downside,\u201d William C. Dudley, the influential president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told Reuters on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019d be reasonable to think that the timing of the Fed\u2019s first rate hike might be a little further off in time.\u201dThe current flatness of the curve shows investors expect mediocre growth.But according to the minutes of the March meeting, released after a standard three-week delay, only a minority of Fed officials said that it was likely that the economy would be strong enough for the Fed to start raising rates that soon.\u201cSeveral participants judged that the economic data and outlook were likely to warrant beginning normalization at the June meeting,\u201d the minutes said. \u201cHowever, others anticipated that the effects of energy price declines and the dollar\u2019s appreciation would continue to weigh on inflation in the near term, suggesting that conditions likely would not be appropriate to begin raising rates until later in the year.\u201dThis debate among Fed officials about the proper calibration of its stimulus campaign is playing out in a narrow range. Most officials agree the Fed should start raising rates this year because the health of the labor market has improved considerably. Most also agree that the economic impact of starting to raise rates in June is likely to be roughly the same as starting in July or September.Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said last month there was a \u201cstrong case\u201d for raising rates at the Fed\u2019s June meeting. He said he expected the recent run of lackluster economic data to be transitory.Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, also said he expected growth to rebound, but he was among a majority of Fed officials, led by the chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, that saw no harm in waiting to be certain.Only a few Fed officials stand outside this consensus, arguing that the Fed should not increase rates until wages and prices start to rise more quickly. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said on Tuesday that the Fed should be \u201cextraordinarily patient\u201d in choosing its moment because many people are still struggling to find work while inflation remains well below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed regards as best for the economy.But Ms. Yellen and other officials say they do not plan to wait. Changes in monetary policy influence economic conditions only gradually, and so they contend the Fed must take account of the water already in the hose in deciding when to shut the spigot.Even those who favor waiting a little longer do not necessarily rule out a June rate increase. Mr. Dudley, in his comments on Wednesday, noted that economic growth this year had fallen short of the Fed\u2019s predictions and that \u201cthe bar is probably a little bit higher\u201d for a June increase. But he said it remained a possibility.\u201cI could imagine circumstances where a June rate hike is still in play,\u201d he said, if the jobs report on April, to be released in early May, is very strong, or if growth \u201clooks like it is bouncing quite sharply.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Black Mayor Is Voted In and a Small Town\u2019s Staff Empties Out", "Date": "2015-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byParma JournalPARMA, Mo. \u2014 It was about a week after Tyus Byrd made history by being elected the first black mayor of this rural hamlet that things started getting weird.Hours before her swearing-in last week, she got a call from a television reporter saying that four of Parma\u2019s six police officers had quit. So had the town\u2019s wastewater manager and clerk, who was supposed to administer the oath of office. Ms. Byrd, 40, wondered whether she would even be able to take office. The hamlet\u2019s staff had been whittled to five from 11.Adding to the intrigue was that the man whom Ms. Byrd defeated, Randall Ramsey, mayor for more than three and a half decades during two separate stints, offered a cryptic reason for the resignations: \u201csafety concerns.\u201dNo one quite knew what that meant at the time. When word of the resignations hit the news wires and then Twitter, people quickly filled the mysterious void with interpretations of their own. With the nation roiled in a post-Ferguson debate over law enforcement in minority communities, many Internet commenters wondered whether this was all about race. (All of the people who resigned are white.)And just like that, this dilapidated, racially mixed community of 700 residents in the farming plains of Missouri\u2019s boot heel was thrust into an uncomfortable spotlight.Many residents seem to believe that what happened was because of tensions between an old government and the new one, not between the races. Even Ms. Byrd, who has not spoken to any of the people who resigned, said it was difficult to know what to pin it on. Asked if it was racism, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s sad; that\u2019s basically what it is,\u201d she added. \u201cIf there were issues, I wasn\u2019t given the opportunity to have a sit down with them and, \u2018Let\u2019s work this out. Let\u2019s do what\u2019s best for the city.\u2019\u201dFew of the players involved have been talking publicly about the resignations. Mr. Ramsey, 78, said the workers had not given him a clear explanation for their quitting. Trish Cohen, the former police chief who was one of the department\u2019s two full-time officers, shooed away a reporter seeking comment at her home in a town about 30 minutes from here.Richard Medley, the other full-time officer, was more forthcoming.His decision, he said, had nothing to do with race. \u201cI resigned due to trust issues,\u201d Mr. Medley said.As he explained it, Ms. Byrd\u2019s father, who was a Parma alderman for years until his defeat in the same election that led to Ms. Byrd\u2019s ascension, had interfered with several police investigations. Mr. Medley, 34, said he was concerned that Ms. Byrd would be just as meddlesome.He also said that he had heard other family members of Ms. Byrd\u2019s make threatening comments to police officers like, \u201cI have family on the City Council; I\u2019ll have your badge; I\u2019ll have your job.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019ve got to be concerned whether or not I\u2019m going to lose my job doing an action any other police officer would do, then that creates hesitation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in this line of work hesitation can mean life or death.\u201dSpeaking on behalf of Ms. Byrd Wednesday night, her husband, Adrian Byrd, responded that \u201ceverybody will be treated the same\u201d by his wife\u2019s administration. Ms. Byrd had said earlier that she had no plans to overhaul the police department or other city staff.Parma is about 37 percent black and 62 percent white. Black and white residents both recall growing up alongside each other without problems. They danced together to Marvin Gaye at Mickey\u2019s, a soul food restaurant with a jukebox, decades ago when this town was thriving with multiple nightclubs and stores. And today, people from both races complain about getting hassled by the local police.Ms. Byrd was among those complaining. Shortly before the election, an officer Tasered a 17-year-old relative of hers and she was outspoken against what her family considered police harassment. But she said in the interview that she thought she had a good relationship with the mayor and the police chief.Ms. Byrd, who works as a missionary for the Church of God in Christ, grew up here before moving away and then returning about a year ago. She ran for mayor, she said, because many people were coming to her with complaints about blight, run-down parks and a lack of activities for children.Parma\u2019s main strip looks like a bombed-out Wild West town, with abandoned brick buildings \u2014 an awning collapsing from one of them \u2014 broken windows and piles of rubble inside. There are two convenience stores and a couple of farming-related businesses, but generally little commercial life. Things here faded over the past several decades, as did the surrounding area, as small-time farming was overtaken by industrial operations, hurting the economy, residents said.Many people here said they questioned whether the hamlet\u2019s previous leadership \u2014 the mayor and the police chief, mostly \u2014 did anything to make things better. Some said they had asked in vain for the hamlet to dig ditches to keep their yards from flooding. They complained about new police vehicles being purchased and driven out of town by officers who lived elsewhere. They questioned how the money was handled \u2014 the mayor admitted, for instance, to allowing town workers to borrow money from the town\u2019s coffers. (He said that the money would later be taken out of their checks.)In an interview, Mr. Ramsey, the former mayor, defended his running of Parma. \u201cI did all I could with what money was available,\u201d he said. Of the current controversy, he said race was not a factor, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of overwhelming right now.\u201dA number of residents speculated that the town\u2019s employees left out of loyalty to Mr. Ramsey, who lost by 122 votes to 84. And for those people, the reaction to the exodus was, generally, good riddance.\u201cHe\u2019s been here too damn long,\u201d Ben Hardin, a 33-year-old farmer who has spent his entire life in Parma, said of the former mayor.Carol Perkins, 48, a distant cousin of Ms. Byrd\u2019s, said the employees who quit were being petty.\u201cShe won fair and square,\u201d Ms. Perkins said of Ms. Byrd. \u201cIf you was a police, and you cared, you wanted to take care of the people in Parma, it don\u2019t matter who your boss is, right?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "States Tighten Conditions for Receiving Food Stamps as the Economy Improves", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUNSWICK, Me. \u2014 The food pantry here, just off the main drag in this neat college town, gets busiest on Wednesdays, when the parking lot is jammed and clients squeeze into the lobby, flipping through books left on a communal shelf as they wait their turn to select about a week\u2019s worth of food.At its core is a basic question: As the economy improves, should states continue waivers that were enacted during the recession to allow healthy adults who are not working to get food stamps longer than the law\u2019s time limit? Maine is one of the states that say no.Last year, the administration of Gov. Paul R. LePage, a Republican, decided to reimpose a three-month limit (out of every three-year period) on food stamps for a group often known as Abawds \u2014 able-bodied adults without minor dependents \u2014 unless they work 20 hours per week, take state job-training courses or volunteer for about six hours per week. Maine, like other states, makes some exceptions.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to incentivize employment, create goals and create time limits on these welfare programs,\u201d said Mary Mayhew, the commissioner of health and human services in Maine. She said the measure was in line with Mr. LePage\u2019s efforts to reform welfare.The number of Abawds receiving food stamps in Maine has dropped nearly 80 percent since the rule kicked in, to 2,530 from about 12,000. This time limit is an old one, written into the 1996 federal welfare law. But, during the recession, most states took advantage of a provision that allows them to waive it when unemployment is persistently high, which meant poor adults could stay on the program regardless of their work status.Maine is one of eight states that qualified for waivers in 2015 but decided to use them only in parts of the state or not at all. And, as the economy improves, more states will cease to qualify for the waivers, even if they want them. The Agriculture Department estimates that 23 states will cease to qualify for statewide waivers in the 2016 fiscal year.\u201cIt means life gets tougher for those childless adults who face barriers already getting back into work,\u201d said Ed Bolen, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He said those adults tended to have limited education and faced a postrecession labor market in which many people who want to work still cannot find jobs. According to the federal Agriculture Department, the households of able-bodied adults receiving food stamps in 2013 had average gross incomes of $308 per month \u2014 or less than 30 percent of the federal poverty guideline.\u201cIf the job situation in the area is a really a tough situation, this is an incredibly harsh provision,\u201d said Ellen Vollinger, the legal and food stamp director for the Food Research and Action Center. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be harm, and it\u2019s going to show up in greater hunger, probably in greater instances of health problems and could show up in greater instances of homelessness.\u201dAround the country, food pantry directors are girding for an influx of hungry adults as the work requirement re-emerges. In Wisconsin, the time limit kicked in statewide on April 1, and the independent Legislative Fiscal Bureau there has estimated that 31,000 people could lose their food stamps.\u201cWe\u2019re going to run out of food,\u201d said Sherrie Tussler, the executive director of the Hunger Task Force Milwaukee. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cause wide-scale hunger here in Milwaukee, and we\u2019re in trouble.\u201dThe staff at the food pantry in Brunswick estimated that 10 clients a week have been losing their food stamps to this provision. It expects that it will see an increase in visits and the amount of food it will need to provide.Jackie Dulack, 38, picked up bread and pork at the Brunswick pantry, and had no plan for when the food ran out. Ms. Dulack, who said she was unemployed and had no income, received a letter from the state last fall saying she would lose her food stamps if she did not meet the work requirement. She said that her food stamps had since been cut off and that the general assistance office had told her that she would need to be working to get them back. (The State Department of Health and Human Services would not confirm her benefit status, citing privacy law.)Ms. Dulack is training to become a personal care aide, but her courses do not count toward the job-training requirement.\u201cHow,\u201d she wondered, \u201cdo you expect people to live and feed themselves and survive with nothing?\u201dOfficials have emphasized that people can meet the work requirement by volunteering about six hours a week, and that is happening here: Warren Bailey, 40, has been unable to find work in towing or fast food and so has signed up as a pantry volunteer. But there is concern in the state that there is not enough volunteering or job-training capacity for food stamp recipients who cannot find jobs, especially in rural parts.\u201cIf you\u2019re not lucky like me and found this place, the food pantry, I don\u2019t even know where else I would go,\u201d Mr. Bailey said.In Kansas, the number of childless, able-bodied adults receiving food stamps dropped by 15,000 in the month after the waiver expired in December 2013, compared with the roughly 3,000 to 4,000 people who had been leaving the program monthly before the change, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.In some states, advocates have sounded the alarm about the administration of the change. After Minnesota became ineligible for a statewide waiver at the end of 2013, Colleen Moriarty of Hunger Solutions was alarmed, she said, when more than twice as many adults as predicted lost food stamps. And legal advocates in Ohio filed a civil rights complaint after the state declined the waiver for 2014 for all but 16 rural counties, noting that cities with large populations of poor minority residents were not in counties that received the waiver.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s Eerie Calm", "Date": "2015-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Greece teeters on the edge of default and possible exit from the European common currency, foreign officials cannot understand how Greek government officials can appear so sanguine. An explanation of the government\u2019s motives and behavior can be found in spheres beyond the economy, where the government has moved swiftly to impose its agenda on domestic and foreign policy \u2014 to the alarm of allies, opposition parties and investors. Nowhere has the government shown an appetite to compromise. This mentality is rooted in a century of conflict between left and right, when foreign powers helped right-wing governments maintain power at the expense of leftist forces. Now, with a radical leftist party, Syriza, in power for the first time, working through this situation could be as self-destructive as it is inevitable. Since its election on Jan. 25, Syriza has adopted programs aimed at easing some of the effects of austerity, while promising to crack down on tax evasion, particularly by the rich. It has taken a more tolerant policy toward migrants and refugees, tested relations with foreign partners, and frozen or rolled back a number of reforms, not only in the economy. In education, a new law would give students and political parties greater influence in the running of universities, restoring a model adopted in the early 1980s that seriously undermined universities (and was changed only in 2011). The police have been instructed to tolerate self-described \u201canti-establishment\u201d activists, to the point that protesters painted insults against the police on riot squad buses. On judicial issues, prosecutors claim that a new law aimed at easing prison congestion and setting free ailing prisoners will release too many convicts unconditionally; the United States and families of the victims of the November 17 terrorist group condemn an impending decision that would allow Savvas Xiros, who is serving five life terms (for, among other crimes, the murder of a United States defense attach\u00e9 in 1988 and a United States Air Force sergeant in 1991), to finish his sentence at home because of injuries sustained in 2002 when a bomb he had intended to plant at a shipping company\u2019s office exploded in his hands. In foreign policy, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras raised eyebrows in Washington and Brussels when he visited President Vladimir V. Putin in Moscow earlier this month, after his government had made clear its opposition to sanctions against Russia for its incursion into Ukraine. Last week, his defense minister was also in Russia, renewing calls for an end to sanctions. (Apart from words, however, Athens has not broken ranks with its partners.) And even as the government says it wants investments and growth, several ministers and Syriza deputies oppose a Canadian company\u2019s gold-mining operation in northern Greece, while government members have given out conflicting signals about the potential expansion of a Chinese company\u2019s container terminal in Piraeus. Mr. Tsipras\u2019s first act as prime minister was to visit a site where German occupying forces carried out a mass execution during World War II. Since then, Parliament has debated Greek claims for reparations for German atrocities and damages, and for the repayment of a loan the Nazis forced the Greek central bank to provide during the occupation. A government official said that the total claim came to 278.7 billion euros. Germany, which directly or indirectly guarantees some \u20ac65 billion of the \u20ac240 billion bailout, says this was dealt with in past agreements. But the Greek Parliament has set up a committee to investigate \u2014 and press \u2014 the issue. Another inquiry is looking into how Greece amassed a debt that reached \u20ac317 billion at the end of 2014; the committee is expected to recommend that part of the debt not be paid. A third committee is investigating the circumstances of the bailout deal signed in 2010. The reparation and debt inquiries are headed by Zoe Konstantopoulou, the Parliament\u2019s speaker, a high-profile opponent of the bailout agreement. They appear designed to play on the government\u2019s message that Greece is the victim of foreign loan sharks and of a corrupt local elite, rather than a country that needs to reform its economy and public administration. Suspicion of foreign powers is the glue that holds the coalition\u2019s two disparate parties together. Independent Greeks, the junior partner, is a hard-line right-wing nationalist group born out of opposition to the bailout; Syriza is the offspring of part of the Communist-led resistance against the Germans in World War II. In the civil war that followed Germany\u2019s defeat, first Britain and then the United States backed a right-wing government, and during most of the Cold War leftists were marginalized in Greece. Challenging Greece\u2019s allies and highlighting claims against Germany give Syriza street credibility, and allow it to appear more \u201cpatriotic\u201d than previous governments, which had raised but not forced the issue of reparations. In negotiations with creditors, the government refuses to reform pensions and labor law, increase value-added taxes and encourage privatization. Yet it expresses confidence that Greece\u2019s European Union partners, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund will back down. \u201cI remain firmly optimistic that there will be an agreement by the end of the month,\u201d Mr. Tsipras told Reuters on April 16. Europe would not \u201cchoose the path of unethical and brutal financial blackmail,\u201d he said, but would opt for \u201cthe path of bridging differences.\u201d To avoid rifts in his party, save face over unrealistic promises he made to voters and underline that he will not be \u201cblackmailed,\u201d Mr. Tsipras prefers to risk a breakup with creditors, which could destroy the economy. Relishing their rise to power, he and his party display intransigence while demanding compromise. They either have unshakable confidence that they will get their way, or blind faith that, as time runs out, others will care more about the Greek people than they appear to and will step in to avert disaster.

{"Headline": "How Not to Report on an Earthquake", "Date": "2015-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs of Tuesday morning, exactly three days have passed since a 7.8-magnitude earthquake shook Nepal, killing thousands and leaving millions in need of help. In disaster response, the end of the first 72 hours is often considered an inflection point: the unofficial moment when the most acute phase passes, the odds of finding trapped survivors plunge and the relief effort tends to really pick up steam.Three days into a crisis, roads and airports are often reopening, and outside responders and journalists are arriving in droves. The decisions made at this time can determine the course of the response. A misstep now can have ramifications lasting years, even decades.Time seemed to stop during the earthquake, and only gradually picked up speed in the days that followed. The first night felt as if it would never end. Aftershocks roiled the ground. People were scouring the rubble for loved ones and neighbors, but the quake had hit in the late afternoon, and in a country with little infrastructure and electricity, it was impossible to continue the search once darkness fell. Nearly everyone who could be was outdoors that night, many of them singing and praying, waiting to see if help would come from outside.It did, though slowly at first. A trickle of aid convoys arrived overland from the Dominican Republic the next morning. A United States military advance team landed at the damaged airport and took over its operations, setting up an emergency air-traffic-control system.Then, on the third day, the skies filled with planes and the harbor with ships. Soon United Nations peacekeepers and American soldiers were scrambling to hand out food and water. My editors at The Associated Press made sure that my colleagues and I traded shifts covering the search-and-rescue efforts; they wanted to be certain we did not miss out on images of survivors being pulled from the rubble.The old standby narratives of disaster coverage picked up from there. We watched for panic and desperation to turn to looting and violence. When aid groups began issuing warnings of impending post-disaster disease outbreaks, we repeated them.Food and water, for example. When I was in Haiti two years later, to research the relief effort for a book, I was shocked to discover that no one could tell me with any precision if there was ever a food or water shortage in the first place. No one among the responders had even contacted the Coordination Nationale de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Alimentaire \u2014 the Haitian government agency overseeing food security \u2014 to find out what might be needed. Indeed, earthquakes tend to inflict the worst damage on cities, not farms \u2014 especially in countries that already have limited infrastructure \u2014 and Haiti\u2019s urban areas didn\u2019t have any sewers or piped drinking water to begin with.People indeed lost their homes and incomes, and markets closed. But the World Food Program had enough supplies in its Port-au-Prince warehouses \u2014 which survived the quake \u2014 to feed 300,000 people one full meal for three weeks. There was no acute food or malnutrition crisis after the quake; that much we know. But it seems very likely that the city could have avoided one even without the frenzied aid push.Our focus on the organized rescue efforts was similarly misplaced. The constant media coverage and well-financed, specialized rescue teams created the impression in many viewers\u2019 minds that large numbers of people were being saved by outside responders. In fact, according to a report by the French Defense Ministry\u2019s Haiti mission, no more than 211 people were saved by all of the international search-and-rescue efforts combined, in a disaster in which hundreds of thousands were trapped.This isn\u2019t the responders\u2019 fault; they worked as hard and as fast as they could. But disaster experts routinely note that a vast majority of rescues after an earthquake take place within the first 24 hours, and are almost always done by people from the area using their hands or simple tools. By contrast, the first American search-and-rescue team didn\u2019t arrive in Haiti until nearly a full day after the disaster.These myths come with consequences. Rash decisions made in the heady days after a disaster, when everyone is committed to the response and the money is flush, are fiendishly difficult to undo. In Haiti, fears of insecurity led to a militarized response that concentrated too much assistance in certain parts of the capital, poured money into defense and security measures when it would have been better spent elsewhere and often treated survivors as threats rather than people to be helped.The sum of all this was an uncoordinated and improvisational relief effort that failed to work with Haitian institutions and people, or to strengthen the Haitian government to face future calamities. Those missed opportunities continue to haunt the country. In a January 2015 report, the International Monetary Fund cited \u201cweaker than assumed aid effectiveness . . . particularly after the 2010 earthquake\u201d as one reason Haiti\u2019s economy has grown more slowly than the fund hoped.Nepal is not Haiti, and 2015 is not 2010. Nepal has its own unique concerns, including high mountain passes at risk for avalanches and colder nights than we ever dreamed of in the Caribbean. Cholera, long endemic there, may spike in the coming monsoon season, as it often does. Nepal\u2019s government is trying harder to coordinate the disaster response than Haiti\u2019s did or could; among other things, it is asking for direct financial support online. More than in past disasters, I\u2019ve seen many people on social media encouraging others to donate to local Nepalese organizations who know their country, and who will stay long after the relief phase ends.Those engaged in the response, whether covering it or participating in it, now have to ask the questions we\u2019ve failed to ask in the past: How exactly did the earthquake affect a given problem? What are the specific goals of the relief effort concerning it? And how will we know if they\u2019ve been met? We don\u2019t know for sure what will come of a relief effort in which everyone is asking those questions, because we\u2019ve never really done it before. But for the people now struggling through their ordeal in the Himalayas, there\u2019s no better time to try.Jonathan M.

Conservative skeptics have actively campaigned to depict climate change as a hoax, while governments, especially in emerging economies, have been loath to take steps that might hamper growth.The pope\u2019s encyclical will not be the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s first word on the issue. His predecessor, Benedict XVI, also linked environmental and moral issues, but his thoughts lacked the unique authority of an encyclical. Francis, moreover, has developed a far more engaged following than the scholarly and conservative Benedict, and his proclamation of what he calls an \u201cintegral ecology\u201d linking development, concern for the poor and responsibility for the environment could well have an impact far beyond his Catholic fans.The encyclical is plainly aimed at influencing the outcome of December\u2019s summit meeting on climate change in Paris.

Noting that \u201cI\u2019ve actually never worked at a firm,\u201d she added: \u201cFor other people, that time probably comes a lot earlier.\u201dMs. Levin, who will join next month as a member of Mr. Johnson\u2019s group and the financial institutions practice, is expected to advise banks on money laundering and other issues that have drawn regulatory scrutiny.\u201cFinancial crime risk is the buzzword at banks today, and she\u2019s been thinking about that long before these issues were in the headlines,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.Ms. Levin, who began at the Justice Department\u2019s civil division in Washington, joined the forfeiture unit in Manhattan in 1991. She has led the unit since 1996, serving under six United States attorneys during that period.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of another person who has had such an important impact over so many years in so many S.D.N.Y. cases,\u201d said Lorin L.

Last week\u2019s trip was the group\u2019s third to the Islamic republic.A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran.\u201cThere was a waiting list. The prospect of a changing Iran is very interesting,\u201d Mr. Simon said.At the function Thursday night, the delegates sat at tables decorated with cards marked with topics of conversation: \u201cReal Estate,\u201d \u201cDiplomacy,\u201d \u201cLuxury\u201d and \u201cICT,\u201d for information and communications technology. The women in the group wore head scarves, as is obligatory in Iran.\u201cI should be at \u2018ICT,\u2019 I think,\u201d said Mr. Lamont, whose Connecticut-based company provides video and data services to college campuses, \u201cbut I think the \u2018Diplomacy\u2019 table will be more interesting for now.\u201dMr. Lamont and the others in the group arrived in Tehran last week after touring ancient sites near Shiraz, a city in the south, under the watchful eyes of government minders.\u201cThey don\u2019t want us to get in any sorts of trouble, or have an incident, but we have been mostly free to go around,\u201d said Mr. Lamont, who like other members of the group was bubbling with enthusiasm over the hospitality of their Iranian hosts.In the Shiite holy city of Qum, the group sat down with a reform-minded ayatollah who told them that Iran was on the verge of major change.\u201cI asked, what about the \u2018Death to America\u2019 slogan?\u201d Mr. Lamont said, referring to the phrase that appears on many banners across the country and has long been shouted at public demonstrations. But the cleric responded that the slogan was from a different era. \u201cHe told us, \u2018This is the new Iran,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Lamont said. \u201cSuch messages are hopeful and different.\u201dAt the restaurant on Thursday, Cyrus Razzaghi, a prominent Iranian business consultant, and other speakers extolled the potential of the Iranian economy for adventurous American investors.\u201cIn the end these are not normal tourists of course, they are wealthy, powerful and influential Americans,\u201d Mr. Razzaghi said. \u201cBesides from giving them a taste of Iranian culture, I felt they would also be interested in Iran\u2019s huge market.\u201dIran\u2019s deputy minister of telecommunications, Nasrollah Jahangard, peppered the audience with statistics, saying Iran was one of the most connected countries in the region.\u201cThe number of smartphones is expected to be doubled to 40 million on a population of nearly 80 million,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have 3G running and 4G networks under development; we are moving forward fast,\u201d Mr. Jahangard said in English.His words seemed to pique the interest of some of the executives. Christopher Schroeder, a venture capitalist, said he saw some promise in the country\u2019s technology sector. \u201cI have met with young women who are running Iran\u2019s versions of Amazon and Groupon. They could really get somewhere in the future.\u201dHowever, it was clear from the questions about the economy and the influence of hard-liners that many obstacles remain.\u201cWhen I look out of that window,\u201d said Richard Cohen, a New York-based real estate developer, pointing at the Tehran skyline, \u201cI see 18 cranes. Only one is working. I have never seen so many unfinished high-rises in my life. What does that symbolize?\u201dSince 1995, sanctions have barred Americans from doing business in Iran, where a substantial middle class represents a potentially lucrative market for foreign companies. Hopes that the nuclear framework agreement made on April 2 might lead to a broader deal by the end of June have raised expectations of an opening of the Iranian market. Still, most companies are waiting for a final deal before seriously considering investing here.\u201cFact is, now we are not even allowed to,\u201d Mr. Simon said.Despite the recent talks between Iran and the United States and the prospect of better relations, Iran\u2019s revolutionary ardor was still visible.In Shiraz, at the tomb of King Cyrus, a major tourist destination, the group passed a billboard bearing a quote by Iran\u2019s first supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.\u201cThe world should know that all Iran and Muslims\u2019 problems are due to the politics of aliens and of the USA. Muslims generally hate aliens and specially the USA,\u201d it reads in English.The executives, however, said they were struck by the warm reception they had received in Iran.\u201cAll in all it seems to me the Iranians really want to reconnect with the world,\u201d said Jennifer Adams Baldock, a former executive in the printing industry. \u201cThey want to move on.\u201dBecause of an editing error, the Tehran Journal article on Monday, about a visit to Iran by American executives who hope the lifting of economic sanctions will open up business opportunities there, misstated the role of one of the visitors, Dick Simon, in the Young Presidents\u2019 Organization, a business network whose members organized the trip.

{"Headline": "Rushing to Stake a Claim on the Market Frontier", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStock markets in big emerging-market countries like China, Brazil and Russia have been sagging. But the returns have been splendid for their oft-overshadowed smaller siblings \u2014 frontier markets like Kazakhstan, Kenya and Kuwait.Mutual funds that invest in the frontiers have surged, according to Morningstar, returning an annualized average of 5.9 percent over the three years through March. By contrast, emerging-market funds have lost an annualized average of 0.3 percent in the same period.\u201cFund companies are always looking for the next thing to promote,\u201d said Patricia Oey, a senior analyst at Morningstar and the author of the report.Yet frontier mutual funds and E.T.F.s may not have a place in everyone\u2019s portfolio. \u201cIt can be hard to know what you\u2019re getting with a frontier fund, so it can be hard to know how it should perform and what role it will play in your portfolio,\u201d said Todd L. Rosenbluth, director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research at S&P Capital IQ.Short performance records mean that investors will not be able to see, for example, how a fund held up during a bear market like that of the 2008-9 financial crisis, he said. What\u2019s more, frontier mutual funds and E.T.F.s are as varied as the countries they invest in. Some buy only in the frontier markets, while others also hunt in smaller emerging markets like Peru and the Philippines, he said. Some also layer on companies that are listed in the developed world but operate mostly in frontier countries.\u201cI can\u2019t come up with two things with the same name that could be any more different than these two E.T.F.s,\u201d Mr. Rosenbluth said.Many frontier countries have been enjoying something of a peace dividend, said Mr. Bell at T. Rowe Price. A generation ago, quite a few were seized by some sort of conflict: civil war in Sri Lanka, border battles between Pakistan and India, the bloody breakup of the former Yugoslavia. \u201cAbout 50 countries in the \u201990s had conflicts,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, there are about 10. When there\u2019s not conflict, investment and economic growth can happen.\u201dProfessional investors often track whether groups of stocks rise and fall in tandem \u2014 whether their returns are correlated. They aim to combine groups that zig and zag independently, thus damping the volatility of a portfolio\u2019s average return. Frontier markets are not closely correlated with the others, and that can be an advantage: A study published in 2013 in The Journal of Portfolio Management found that adding a frontier E.T.F. to a portfolio diversified across developed and emerging markets achieved that.\u201cIf you look at the individual countries, frontier markets are risky,\u201d said Kuntara Pukthuanthong, one of the study\u2019s authors and a finance professor at the University of Missouri. \u201cBut when you build a diversified portfolio, because the market integration of frontiers with the other markets is lower, the risk of the whole portfolio is lower.\u201dYet there is no guarantee that economic growth will translate into investment wealth. Vanguard\u2019s studies have found little correlation between growth and stock-market returns, said Christopher B. Philips, who leads the client service team for the institutional investment group at Vanguard.\u201cThere should be a long-term link, but in the shorter term, the relationships are zero,\u201d he said. \u201cIn China, for example, we found that despite its strong growth, it has had a zero percent total return of its equity markets since inception.\u201dMr. Philips did not know why the hoped-for relationship had not arisen. He speculated there might be a disconnect between stocks and the broader economies. \u201cThe securities you can invest in differ from the drivers of the economy,\u201d he said. In Nigeria, for example, oil propels much of the growth, but state-run companies and foreign multinationals control much of the production.\u201cFrontiers shouldn\u2019t be your core investment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they can give you higher return potential and reduce the volatility in a portfolio.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Nets were one of four teams separated by a half-game for the eighth playoff spot in the Eastern Conference but, at 30-40, had showed that they would probably be little more than an appetizer for the top-seeded Atlanta Hawks if they qualified for the postseason.The Nets won seven of eight games going into Wednesday\u2019s, however, while climbing into seventh. Coinciding with the recent success, Mikhail D. Prokhorov, the Nets\u2019 boastful billionaire owner, made a rare appearance at Barclays Center.The Knicks have struggled all season, but their game Wednesday, against the Indiana Pacers, one of the teams chasing the Nets in the playoff race, suddenly had interest, too.Making the circumstances even more unusual, two Atlanta Hawks players, Thabo Sefolosha and Pero Antic, were arrested and charged with interfering in the investigation of Copeland\u2019s case. In the shadow of this episode, the Knicks fell, 102-86, to the Pacers while the Nets lost to the short-handed Hawks, 114-111.Sefolosha and Antic were released before the game but were not on the Hawks\u2019 bench. The All-Star Paul Millsap was also inactive because of a shoulder injury.\u201cWe\u2019re very supportive of our players,\u201d Hawks Coach Mike Budenholzer said before the game. \u201cYou never want to put yourself in a position where you can bring negativity to yourself or the organization or your teammates. But they\u2019re great guys. I think right now what\u2019s most important is to support them.\u201dAs for the Knicks, they wasted little time in losing for the 63rd time this season. The Pacers had a 16-point lead by halftime and coasted to victory at Madison Square Garden, where fans were at least treated to the sight of Carmelo Anthony behind the bench for the first time since he had season-ending knee surgery in February.Chris Mullin, newly appointed as the men\u2019s basketball coach at St. John\u2019s, was also courtside. So he had a good view when the Knicks\u2019 Cole Aldrich accidentally scored on his own basket after tipping a rebound late in the first quarter. The Pacers (35-43) were able to shake off any potential distractions and give their playoff hopes a boost. Paul George, appearing in his second game since returning from a broken leg, came off the bench to score 10 points in 16 minutes. The Knicks were led by Langston Galloway\u2019s 19 points.The nightclub fracas did not appear to have any effect on the Hawks early in the game as they jumped to a 17-6 lead.Hawks center Al Horford said the \u201cfocus is on this game, this team, and we did a good job of that.\u201d He added, \u201cWe were very ready to play.\u201dWith the help of guard Jeff Teague, who had 12 assists, the Hawks proved adept at running an up-tempo offense that allowed DeMarre Carroll (19 points) to hit several open 3-pointers and Mike Scott (20 points) to make numerous field goals beneath the basket.Horford led the Hawks with 24 points and put his team ahead, 112-111, with a dunk with 19 seconds remaining. Teague, who had 15 points, made two free throws for a 114-111 lead. The Nets\u2019 Joe Johnson missed a 3-point attempt as time expired.The loss dropped the Nets to 36-42, the same record as the Boston Celtics\u2019. The teams occupy the final two playoff spots, with the Pacers and the Miami Heat one game behind. The Hawks, a possible first-round opponent for the Nets, took all four games they played against the Nets this season, winning by a combined 69 points.Speaking to reporters earlier in the day, Prokhorov said he was excited to watch a Nets team that was relying on more athletic lineups compared with when he last saw them in November.\u201cI think that young players like Thaddeus Young and Markel Brown bring speed, power, some emotions for us,\u201d Prokhorov said.Prokhorov said recent uncertainty in the Russian economy had kept him attached to business matters there and away from Brooklyn. He reiterated that he did not intend to sell the team.Scott Cacciola contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senator Sessions, Straight Up", "Date": "2015-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialBut here is Mr. Sessions, ditching the usual Republican talking points on immigration, choosing instead to echo an uglier time in our history, when nativists wielded the spurious argument that the more immigrants taken in by America, the worse off America is. He\u2019s advocating for \u201cslowing the pace\u201d of legal immigration, supposedly to increase job opportunities for native-born, low-skilled workers, particularly African-Americans. He equates a wave of immigration from the 1970s to the present with the continuing \u201ccontraction\u201d of the middle-class. Admitting too many foreign-born workers, he says, lowers the wages of Americans, and he worries darkly about the effect of so many foreigners on \u201cschools, hospitals and many other community resources.\u201dThis is all so obvious \u2014 or it used to be \u2014 that most mainstream Republicans accepted it. Yet Mr. Sessions accuses the financial and political \u201celite\u201d of a conspiracy to keep wages down through immigration. He seems to be betting that a revival of 1920s-style closed-borders populism will resonate, at a time when many Americans are fretting about income inequality and shriveled opportunity. Politicians on the left \u2014 like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York; and Zephyr Teachout, the Fordham law professor who ran a spirited campaign for New York governor \u2014 have persuasively argued that corporatist forces are making life difficult for the working woman and man. To excite Democratic voters in her presidential campaign, Hillary Rodham Clinton may have to adopt the same stance, or at least convincingly fake it.But nowhere in that argument is there a case for yanking America\u2019s welcome mat. Mr. Sessions ignores the truth, proved over centuries, that immigration over all is good for the American economy. His tears for low-income Americans fail to impress, given his party\u2019s obdurate hostility to policies that help the poor and working class. If he truly wanted to lift them up, he would be better off supporting labor unions and women\u2019s rights, higher minimum wages, tougher wage-and-hour enforcement, more access to child-care and reproductive rights. And immigration reform that unleashes the economic power of the nation\u2019s shadow unauthorized population and welcomes the newcomers that our society and economy need.America\u2019s long success as an immigration nation is hard to argue against.

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Fukui Prefecture, with 13 commercial nuclear reactors clustered along a short, rugged coastline, has earned the area a reputation as a political stronghold for the atomic power industry. Nuclear-friendly politicians dominate most of Fukui\u2019s government offices, and the region is nicknamed Genpatsu Ginza, or Nuclear Alley.Fukui has now emerged as a battleground for the Japanese government\u2019s effort to rebuild the nuclear industry and reverse the economic impact of the reactor shutdowns. On Tuesday, a local judge blocked the latest attempt to get atomic power back on the grid, issuing an injunction forbidding the restarting of two nuclear reactors at the Takahama power plant in the region.The nuclear industry has been in a state of paralysis since the meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant four years ago. None of the 48 usable reactors in Japan are back online.Business groups say that delays in returning at least some plants to service are wrecking their bottom line. The price of electricity has increased by 20 percent or more, reflecting the cost of importing more oil and natural gas to make up for the lost nuclear power. That translates to the equivalent of several tens of billions of dollars a year in added expenses for households and companies, according to government estimates.It is a potential stumbling block for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s efforts to rekindle economic growth, which have focused on increasing corporate profits and consumer spending. Because of the increased use of fossil fuels, Japan\u2019s carbon emissions have also risen in the four years since the country began taking its reactors offline.The decline in oil prices, which have fallen about 50 percent since June, has taken some of the pressure off the economy. But the government nonetheless sees a revival of nuclear power as critical to supporting growth and slowing an exodus of Japanese industry to lower-cost countries.The Kansai Electric Power Company, which owns the plant at the heart of the ruling issued on Tuesday, serves a swath of western Japan that includes the metropolis of Osaka. The area served is also home to industrial giants like Panasonic.Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary for Mr. Abe, questioned the scientific rationale for the Fukui court\u2019s decision and said it would not alter the government\u2019s support for nuclear power.\u201cThe reactors have been judged by experts to meet the new safety standards,\u201d Mr. Suga said, referring to a review by the Nuclear Regulation Authority of Japan that was completed late last year. The agency determined that the Takahama reactors met tougher guidelines introduced after the Fukushima disaster. \u201cWe will respect that judgment, and there is no change to our policy of moving ahead with restarts,\u201d Mr. Suga said.Kansai Electric had intended the reactors in Fukui to be among the first in the country to be returned to service after the introduction of the new rules more than two years ago. But in his ruling on Tuesday, the judge, Hideaki Higuchi, challenged the adequacy of the standards, which cover things like plants\u2019 resistance to earthquakes and tsunamis, the triggers for the Fukushima disaster.\u201cThere is little rational basis for saying that an earthquake with a magnitude that exceeds the safety standard will not occur,\u201d said Judge Higuchi, 62. \u201cIt is an optimistic view.\u201dThe reactors had been widely expected to return to service by the end of the year. While Kansai Electric said it would appeal, experts said its plans could be delayed by months or even years.It was the second time Judge Higuchi had issued an order forbidding a nuclear plant in Fukui to operate, and he remains the only judge in Japan to have ruled against a utility over nuclear restarts since Fukushima. He became a hero among antinuclear activists in May when he ruled that two reactors at another Kansai Electric facility, the Oi nuclear plant, must remain switched off because the utility had not shown that they could be operated safely.Judge Higuchi\u2019s decision on Tuesday was potentially more significant because it directly challenged the new safety standards set out by the Nuclear Regulation Authority. It was his first ruling against a plant that had been certified as safe under the new regulations; the Oi power station had yet to undergo a safety review.The injunction was requested by a group of nine residents of Fukui and surrounding prefectures.\u201cThis ruling is a historic step toward abolishing nuclear power, and the government and power company should respect it,\u201d a lawyer for the group told NHK, Japan\u2019s national broadcaster.Judge Higuchi\u2019s critics say he lacks the technical expertise to reach conclusions about nuclear safety.Shinichi Nishikawa, a professor at Meiji University, said Japanese judges were often reluctant to challenge government policies. He noted that Judge Higuchi had spent his career in low-level local courts and was \u201cnot part of the elite\u201d judiciary, where rulings favorable to the government can be a precondition for promotion.\u201cLast year\u2019s ruling took courage, but this ruling may have taken even more courage,\u201d Professor Nishikawa said.Japan\u2019s nuclear shutdown has created serious financial problems for utilities like Kansai Electric, which before the accident relied on atomic power to generate nearly 30 percent of its electricity. Several utilities, including Kansai Electric, have received low-interest loans and other emergency aid from the government.Since he took office in late 2012, Mr. Abe has reversed a pledge by a previous government to wean Japan off nuclear power completely over the next several decades.The governing Liberal Democratic Party is formulating a long-term energy strategy that is expected to set a target of about 20 percent for nuclear power\u2019s share of electricity generation.Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nokia in Advanced Merger Talks With Alcatel-Lucent", "Date": "2015-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 It is a paradox of the digital age: Even as smartphones and high-speed Internet access become more crucial to everyday life and commerce, the makers of the equipment that underpins those networks can struggle to make money.Cutthroat competition, particularly between the European and Chinese manufacturers that now dominate the industry, has kept network equipment costs low despite the increasingly sophisticated \u2014 and expensive \u2014 research and development that go into the technology.That is why two of the industry\u2019s biggest players, the Finnish company Nokia and its French-American rival, Alcatel-Lucent, are in advanced talks toward a merger that would make the combined companies the world\u2019s second-biggest network equipment maker. Only Ericsson, of Sweden, would be larger.The Chinese giant Huawei, whose global emergence over the last decade as a cost-cutting juggernaut has played a role in a wave of industry consolidations, would slip to third place.Nokia announced the merger talks on Tuesday morning. Later in the day, the idea received an apparent nod of support from the French government, which has often intervened when local companies have become takeover targets for international competitors.If completed, the deal would create a company with combined revenues of about $27 billion and might be better poised to provide telecom hardware and software to some of the world\u2019s largest carriers, including AT&T and Verizon in the United States, Vodafone and Orange in Europe, and SoftBank in Japan.But many of those customers have started to cut back. AT&T and SoftBank, for example, are still catching their breath after investing billions of dollars over the last decade to upgrade to the latest high-speed networks. And as the provision of network equipment has increasingly become a commodity business, manufacturers have been forced to lay off tens of thousands of employees in a bid to stay afloat.\u201cThe industry is in need of consolidation,\u201d said Bengt Nordstrom, co-founder of Northstream, a telecom consulting firm. \u201cAfter years of growth, the telecom industry is now shrinking. A combination of Nokia and Alcatel was bound to happen at some point.\u201dNokia and Alcatel-Lucent are themselves the result of consolidations. Nokia merged its telecommunications network business with that of the German industrial conglomerate Siemens in 2006, before buying out Siemens in 2013. Alcatel and Lucent \u2014 the former equipment arm of AT&T \u2014 merged in 2006, as both were struggling, and they have trod a fairly rocky path since.But these were not always troubled companies.In 1996, when AT&T spun off Lucent, the stock quickly became a Wall Street favorite, rising to more than $63 a share and surpassing AT&T in market value by 1998. But in 2000, Lucent was caught wrong-footed by a sudden slowdown in demand for communications equipment and reported a series of disappointing quarterly results. Its chairman and chief executive was ousted, and the Securities and Exchange Commission began an inquiry into its accounting practices. The shares slid to a low of 58 cents in 2002.\u201cNokia has the ambitions, and they have the cash from the Microsoft sale,\u201d said Sylvain Fabre, a telecom analyst at the technology research company Gartner.The companies\u2019 chief executives \u2014 Michel Combes of Alcatel-Lucent and Rajeev Suri of Nokia \u2014 met Tuesday afternoon with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, and the office of the economy minister indicated it might support a merger.While Alcatel-Lucent is incorporated in France, its North American operations, based around the legacy Lucent business in Murray Hill, N.J., contributed almost half of its 2014 annual revenue of 13.2 billion euros, or about $14.1 billion. Europe represented about 22 percent, and Asia just under 20 percent.France\u2019s previous economy minister, Arnaud Montebourg, was known for taking a critical view of deals that would lead to French companies passing under foreign control.This time, however, the state appears to be encouraging a deal. Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron told reporters on Tuesday that combining the companies \u201cwould permit the creation of a European champion to take on Chinese competition,\u201d though the world\u2019s largest equipment market is Ericsson.Mr. Macron, speaking to the news media after Mr. Hollande\u2019s meeting with the company executives, also addressed one of the government\u2019s main worries, saying that he did not expect any jobs to be lost in France.Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s French unions expressed \u201cconcern\u201d with the prospect of a merger, in light of job losses that would most likely come with a combination of companies that each employ more than 50,000 people worldwide. They called on Mr. Macron to \u201cbe vigilant of the social and industrial consequences, notably on employment in France.\u201dSome analysts expressed doubts whether Nokia would be able to successfully integrate Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s existing operations if the French government took an active role in the proposed merger.Nokia said the companies were discussing a deal that would most likely include Nokia offering its own shares in exchange for shares of Alcatel-Lucent.Nokia shares fell more than 4 percent in Helsinki on Tuesday, while shares of Alcatel-Lucent jumped 16 percent in Paris.In its latest full-year earnings, Nokia reported a marginal increase in its overall revenues, to \u20ac12.7 billion, while the company\u2019s annual net profit rose to \u20ac3.5 billion \u2014 aided by the sale of its handset sale to Microsoft.Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s revenues in 2014 fell 5 percent, to \u20ac13.2 billion, and the company reported a yearly loss of \u20ac83 million due to restructuring costs.Nokia did not say how much it could pay for its French rival. It has a market capitalization of \u20ac26.6 billion, more than double Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s market value.The potential tie-up would help the combined European telecom manufacturer to face the growing number of Chinese rivals, which have used their lower manufacturing costs and strength in their home market to become global telecom giants in their own right.In particular, Huawei and another Chinese player, ZTE, have landed a number of network contracts with large Western operators.So far, however, Chinese manufacturers \u2014 many of which have connections to the Chinese government \u2014 have been barred from selling their wares in the United States over fears that the Chinese may try to use the equipment to commit cyber warfare, such as electronic spying and network disruption.Huawei and ZTE deny the accusations.For Mr. Suri of Nokia, the potential takeover of Alcatel-Lucent represents the latest challenge after he successfully turned around Nokia\u2019s struggling telecom equipment business.Faced with significant losses at the unit, Mr. Suri, an Indian citizen who joined the company in the mid-1990s, announced 17,000 job cuts in 2011. He subsequently bought out Siemens\u2019 stake in Nokia\u2019s equipment business in 2013 for $2.2 billion.After several years of cost cutting and the deal with Microsoft, Nokia now relies on its equipment unit, which represents about 85 percent of the company\u2019s annual revenues. Like other equipment makers, the company is focusing on winning potential European contracts after analysts have predicted a slowdown in how much carriers in North American and certain Asia markets, including Japan and China, will spend on new costly equipment.And in a sign that Mr. Suri may be further doubling down on the equipment business, Nokia is now in talks to sell its mapping business, Here, which is valued roughly $2.5 billion. Here competes with the likes of Google Maps to offer digital mapping services on people\u2019s cellphones and in sectors like the automotive industry, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.Mark Scott reported from London, and David Jolly from Paris.

{"Headline": "Deal Reached on Fast-Track Authority for Obama on Trade Accord", "Date": "2015-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Key congressional leaders agreed on Thursday on legislation to give President Obama special authority to finish negotiating one of the world\u2019s largest trade accords, opening a rare battle that aligns the president with Republicans against a broad coalition of Democrats.In what is sure to be one of the toughest fights of Mr. Obama\u2019s last 19 months in office, the \u201cfast track\u201d bill allowing the White House to pursue its planned Pacific trade deal also heralds a divisive fight within the Democratic Party, one that could spill into the 2016 presidential campaign.With committee votes planned next week, liberal senators such as Sherrod Brown of Ohio are demanding to know Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s position on the bill to give the president so-called trade promotion authority, or T.P.A.Trade unions, environmentalists and Latino organizations \u2014 potent Democratic constituencies \u2014 quickly lined up in opposition, arguing that past trade pacts failed to deliver on their promise and that the latest effort would harm American workers.The deal was struck by Senators Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Finance Committee chairman; Ron Wyden of Oregon, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat; and Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. It would give Congress the power to vote on the more encompassing 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership once it is completed, but would deny lawmakers the chance to amend what would be the largest trade deal since the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994, which President Bill Clinton pushed through Congress despite opposition from labor and other Democratic constituencies.While supporters have promised broad gains for American consumers and the economy, the clearest winners of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement would be American agriculture, along with technology and pharmaceutical companies, insurers and many large manufacturers that say they could also expand United States\u2019 exports to the other 11 nations in Asia and South America that are involved.President Obama embraced the legislation immediately, proclaiming \u201cit would level the playing field, give our workers a fair shot, and for the first time, include strong fully enforceable protections for workers\u2019 rights, the environment and a free and open Internet.\u201d\u201cToday,\u201d he added, \u201cwe have the opportunity to open even more new markets to goods and services backed by three proud words: Made in America.\u201dBut Mr. Obama\u2019s enthusiasm was tempered by the rancor the bill elicited from some of his strongest allies. To win over the key Democrat, Mr. Wyden, the Republicans agreed to stringent requirements for the deal, including a human rights negotiating objective that has never existed on trade agreements.The bill would make any final trade agreement open to public comment for 60 days before the president signs it, and up to four months before Congress votes. If the agreement, negotiated by the United States trade representative, fails to meet the objectives laid out by Congress \u2014 on labor, environmental and human rights standards \u2014 a 60-vote majority in the Senate could shut off \u201cfast-track\u201d trade rules and open the deal to amendment.\u201cWe got assurances that U.S.T.R. and the president will be negotiating within the parameters defined by Congress,\u201d said Representative Dave Reichert, Republican of Washington and a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cAnd if those parameters are somehow or in some way violated during the negotiations, if we get a product that\u2019s not adhering to the T.P.A. agreement, than we have switches where we can cut it off.\u201dTo further sweeten the deal for Democrats, the package includes expanding trade adjustment assistance \u2014 aid to workers whose jobs are displaced by global trade \u2014 to service workers, not just manufacturing workers. Mr. Wyden also insisted on a four-year extension of a tax credit to help displaced workers purchase health insurance.Both the Finance and Ways and Means committees will formally draft the legislation next week in hopes of getting it to final votes before a wave of opposition can sweep it away. \u201cIf we don\u2019t act now we will lose our opportunity,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.At a Senate Finance Committee hearing Thursday morning, Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, and Michael Froman, the United States trade representative, pleaded for the trade promotion authority.\u201cT.P.A. sends a strong signal to our trading partners that Congress and the administration speak with one voice to the rest of the world on our priorities,\u201d Mr. Lew testified.Even with the concessions, many Democrats sound determined to oppose the president. Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, condemned the bill as \u201ca major step backward.\u201dThe A.F.L.-C.I.O. and virtually every major union \u2014 convinced that trade promotion authority will ease passage of trade deals that will cost jobs and depress already stagnant wages \u2014 have vowed a fierce fight. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. announced a \u201cmassive\u201d six-figure advertising campaign to pressure 16 selected senators and 36 House members to oppose fast-track authority.\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to pass fast track, which would lead to more lost jobs and lower wages,\u201d said Richard Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. \u201cWe want Congress to keep its leverage over trade negotiations \u2014 not rubber-stamp a deal that delivers profits for global corporations, but not good jobs for working people.\u201dIn all, the bill sets down 150 negotiating objectives, such as tough new rules on intellectual property protection, lowering of barriers to agricultural exports, labor and environmental standards, rule of law and human rights. Reflecting the modern economy, Congress would demand a loosening of restrictions on cross-border data flow, an end to currency manipulation and rules for competition from state-owned enterprises.Businesses and business lobbying groups lined up behind the bill as fast as liberal groups and unions arrayed in opposition. \u201cWith facts and arguments, we\u2019ll win this trade debate and renew T.P.A.,\u201d vowed Thomas J. Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.It all made for a dizzying change of tone in a Washington where partisan lines have hardened. Republican leadership fell firmly behind T.P.A. Business groups battling the president on climate change, taxes and health care urged Congress to expand his trade powers.But a sizable minority of Republicans \u2014 especially in the House \u2014 are reluctant to give the president authority to do anything substantive. Whether Republican leaders can get their troops in line, and how Mr. Obama can round up enough Democratic votes, might be the biggest legislative question of the year.Mr. Reichert, the Republican lawmaker, said 20 or fewer Democrats currently support the measure in the House; last year, House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said he would need 50.Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Democrat, said he will demand the inclusion of legislation to combat the manipulation of currency values, especially by China. \u201cChina is the most rapacious of our trading partners, and the stated goal of this deal is to lure these other countries away from China,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s not at all contradictory to finally do something with China\u2019s awful trade practices.\u201dMr. Brown said the negotiating objectives must be turned into solid requirements. \u201cI don\u2019t think negotiating objectives without more enforcement mechanisms get you very far,\u201d he said. \u201cNegotiating objectives are, \u2018Hey U.S.T.R., try to get this,\u2019 and they\u2019ll say, \u2018We tried.\u2019 We need something better than that.\u201dOthers appeared dead set against the accord.\u201cOver and over again we\u2019ve been told that trade deals will create jobs and better protect workers and the environment,\u201d said Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania. \u201cThose promises have never come to fruition.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Exile, but Ready to Save Russia", "Date": "2015-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Early in the morning on Monday last week, a phone call woke me. It was a friend from Washington, a political consultant who follows Russia closely: \u201cThere\u2019s a billboard with your picture facing the Kremlin. It\u2019s huge. Sending you the pic, in case you didn\u2019t see it yet.\u201dMy smartphone vibrated a second time, with the image: There, on the facade of a 10-story Stalinist-era building on Moscow\u2019s central Tverskaya Street, were the words \u201cNational Traitor,\u201d across a photo showing me, smiling. \u201cI kind of like the picture, but not so sure about the message,\u201d I told my friend, in an attempt at levity.The next day, the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, voted to lift my legislative immunity so that I can be prosecuted on charges of misappropriation of public funds and then removed from office. The charges were trumped up, in a fashion typical for modern Russia.My real crime: I was the lone dissenter, in March 2014, when the Duma voted, 445 to 1, to approve the annexation of Crimea. My vote made headlines across the West, where my distaste for President Vladimir V. Putin is well known. I am an entrepreneur and an outspoken advocate of the use of technology to make government more transparent. I was democratically elected to represent Novosibirsk, Russia\u2019s third-largest city. I once worked for one of Mr. Putin\u2019s chief rivals, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, who was imprisoned from 2003 to 2013. I took part in mass protests against Mr. Putin\u2019s rule in 2005 and 2012. Over the years I\u2019ve received too many threats to keep count.I will never forget the gloomy afternoon of March 18, 2014, when I sat still in the Kremlin while members of the Duma stood and cheered as Mr. Putin defended his seizure of Crimea. He called me and my fellow critics \u201cnational traitors,\u201d a phrase once used by Hitler. I knew that invading Ukraine meant war, economic collapse for Russia and the reversal of everything I have sought, including the Obama administration\u2019s attempt to \u201creset\u201d United States-Russian relations, which I had advocated passionately.Over the next few months, Russia witnessed yet more brain drain, as Mr. Putin\u2019s government tightened its crackdown on any dissent. In mid-August, during a business trip outside Russia, I found that my credit cards were not working. A leading Russian newspaper soon reported that the authorities had prohibited me from traveling abroad and had seized my assets. I had the equivalent of $21 on me. I haven\u2019t been back since.I am one of roughly a million Russians \u2014 thinkers, reformers, business leaders, scientists and regular people seeking freedom \u2014 who have been exported from Russia in recent years. We are no longer in our home country, not because we don\u2019t love it, but because the values and culture of our Motherland have changed so radically that we sought refuge in the freer countries of the West. We miss our homes and families and, most of all, we miss our countrymen, whom we knew to be curious, caring and among the brightest in the world. Sadly, those traits have been harnessed to blame people like me and other elements of political change for the economic and cultural problems of my country.The Russia of 2015 is like the Germany of 1933. I don\u2019t make the comparison lightly. Mr. Putin\u2019s promises to revive Russia\u2019s economy (despite crushing Western sanctions) and \u201crestore\u201d our national dignity can be sustained only by further conquest and bloodshed. The West shares in the blame: At the end of the Cold War, it repeated the mistakes of Versailles of 1919, by imposing shock capitalism instead of integrating Russia into a stable world order. But it is fruitless to debate the past: The question is what should be done.The political opposition in Russia has been so thoroughly suppressed that I think the best hope lies with exiles. After the collapse of the Soviet bloc, progressive East European elites reoriented their countries around national renewal. In Russia and Ukraine, in contrast, the old Soviet-style bureaucracy held on. Elites cannot be changed gradually, as newcomers will be corrupted by the bad practices and approaches of the past. The future needs to be built from scratch.Those of us who have left can help lead the start-up class of a new Russia. We possess great treasures: people who read or listen to us (despite Internet censorship), communicate with us and trust us, despite differences in distance and status. Entrepreneurs, journalists, artists, scholars and scientists \u2014 we have intangible but real power. That\u2019s why we\u2019re a threat to Mr. Putin.Our vision for Russia is simple, but it goes beyond the noble (but doomed) opposition mantra of calling for fair elections. We want a smaller, more responsive central government. We want an independent and modern court system, with strong separation of powers. We want the bulk of taxes to go to self-governing regional and local communities, ending centuries of centralized control from the Kremlin. We want to unleash the forces of entrepreneurship and competition, so that Russia, while blessed with plentiful oil and gas, does not solely depend on them for economic survival.Skeptics, including fatalistic Russians, say that our country\u2019s only experience is of autocracy \u2014 but they are mistaken. Decades of Soviet totalitarianism, followed by kleptocracy, taught Russians to rely on themselves, and survive through their own initiative. Our creative and entrepreneurial energies can be unleashed \u2014 if there is equality before the law, and the political will to enforce it.From London to Silicon Valley to Mr. Putin\u2019s prisons, Russia\u2019s people of change are waiting. They are people like Pavel Durov, who founded the leading Russian social networking service, Vkontakte, which Mr. Putin\u2019s cronies seized, and who is now in exile in the West; Leonard Blavatnik, the wealthy businessman and philanthropist living in New York; Aleksei A. Navalny, the political activist who has been prosecuted for his battle against corruption and who remains in Russia, precariously; and Mr. Khodorkovsky, now in exile in Switzerland. What do they have in common? They all care about Russia and they all have a global vision, ready to embrace what\u2019s best about the West to benefit their home country. Is it better to stay and fight from a prison cell, or to change things by applying pressure from the outside? It\u2019s a question I grapple with every day. But I know that Russia\u2019s future demands a new start-up generation that will take our country back.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Consumer Prices in Eurozone Decline Again, but So Does Unemployment", "Date": "2015-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The eurozone continues to flirt with deflation, an official report showed on Tuesday, as consumer prices fell in March for a fourth consecutive month. A separate report, though, showed the unemployment rate in the zone, a 19-nation currency union, dipping slightly in February.While the data gave little reason to cheer, the reports did not alter the view that Europe, despite its problems, is experiencing a miniboom, lifted by low oil prices, a weak euro and aggressive stimulus from the European Central Bank.The latest reports \u201cdid not lift the threat of a prolonged period of deflation in the currency union,\u201d Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. He pointed out that the \u201ccore\u201d inflation rate, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, actually fell to 0.6 percent from 0.7 percent. The latest reading was the lowest since Eurostat began measuring it in 1997.Mr. Loynes noted that unemployment \u201cremains very high by historical standards,\u201d not far from the record 12.1 percent reached in 2013, \u201csignaling the persistence of a large amount of spare capacity in the labor market.\u201dSome economists took heart over the fact that the decline in overall consumer prices had slowed, suggesting that inflation could turn positive again soon, especially if the downturn in energy costs was not sustained. But the measure that matters most to policy makers, core inflation, is still moving in the wrong direction.The lower core rate reinforced expectations that the central bank would keep pushing policies that effectively weaken the euro. The currency, which has lost more than 11 percent of its value against the dollar this year, fell 0.9 percent after the reports to $1.0737 on Tuesday afternoon in trading in Paris. The eurozone equity benchmark index Euro Stoxx 50 was down nearly 1 percent.Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London, said the market had taken the European data in stride. The market, he said, was focusing on the performance gap between the United States, where the Federal Reserve seems to be moving toward raising interest rates, and Europe, where the European Central Bank has its work cut out trying to hold off deflationary pressures.\u201cThe momentum seems to have shifted back to selling the euro,\u201d Mr. Halpenny said. \u201cThe primary element of that is what\u2019s happening inside the United States, and that hasn\u2019t changed at all.\u201dAlthough declines in the price of commodities like oil can act as a stimulus, economists fear a generalized decline in price levels, known as deflation, could sap growth and make life harder for borrowers. International Monetary Fund economists had argued since even before consumer prices turned negative that Europe\u2019s inflation was too low.Fitch Ratings warned in a report on Monday that eurozone deflation was \u201cthe largest potential risk\u201d to global corporate credit ratings because the region\u2019s weight in the world economy meant that falling prices and economic weakness there \u201cwill have knock-on effects on other regions.\u201dEconomists describe the upturn as a cyclical recovery, noting that important indicators are showing strength, despite the failure of the currency bloc to grow at its potential rate. The eurozone economy has still not recovered its pre-2008 crisis levels, and growth has been too weak to generate the jobs needed to break decisively with the crisis era.Taking the bloc as a whole, however, obscures the fact that member states are diverging widely in their performance. The jobless rate in Germany, the biggest eurozone member, is just 4.8 percent, less than one-fourth that of the bloc\u2019s fourth-largest member, Spain, which at 23.2 percent, has a rate consistent with an economic depression.Italy, the third-largest member, reported an increase to 12.7 percent in its jobless rate, a record. Unemployment in France, the second-largest economy in the eurozone, stood at 10.6 percent, little changed for months.Advertisement"}

Send your man. Need some onions last minute from the grocer? Send your man. I had no man. But this I could not confess. Any self-respecting man, it seemed, had a man.Sometimes these men were called \u201cboys.\u201d Sometimes, they were called P.A.s, as in personal assistants. Sometimes they were \u201cpeons,\u201d but pronounced more like \u201cpunes,\u201d making the Spanish conquistadors\u2019 term for forced servitude sound worse than it already does.The culture of send-your-man was jarring to me, having grown up in an America where even rather privileged people did many things for themselves, including things easily outsourced. They drove themselves and their children around, went to the supermarket themselves, contested their own parking tickets in person. While living in India, I remember seeing a photograph of a United States Supreme Court justice driving himself into work and thinking to myself: No lowly municipal judge in India would do that.To those of us who have lived in extremely rich and extremely poor countries, these developments in America may be especially worrying. What if all this convenience, of which I avail as much as the next person, is microgood and macrobad, reflecting the coming of a society where, as in the developing world, large numbers of people have no better opportunities than to wait on the fortunate?Is technological innovation the handmaiden of progress? People tend to use the two concepts interchangeably. But it\u2019s possible that we live in a peculiar age that, in America at least, is innovation-rich and progress-poor. Just as we came to learn that democracy and liberalism don\u2019t necessarily go together, that there can be illiberal democracies (Argentina, Iraq), perhaps we are starting to discover something we might call regressive innovation.This isn\u2019t, on its own, dispiriting. It just means that innovation, like democracy, is without content. Democracy doesn\u2019t automatically safeguard women and minorities. Those are layers we have to add. Likewise, perhaps, innovation doesn\u2019t necessarily make the world flat, free and equal. It just gives us new ways of achieving the aims, good and bad, that have motivated us forever.One of those eternal aims seems to be access to servitude. In India, even today, you hear some say their servants aren\u2019t really servants; they\u2019re \u201cfamily.\u201d And yet few ever think to help these \u201cfamily\u201d members rise out of servitude. At the most, the employer will open a bank account for them or teach them a skill or two. But to threaten one\u2019s convenience by giving them the chance not to have to serve you \u2014 well, that would be foolish. Now Americans are learning to play this game: savoring the convenience and trying to forget where it comes from.Advertisement"}

The traders stand in doorways and along the walls of trading floors, watching anxiously as middlemen one rung above them \u2014 the exporters \u2014 sort the pelts by quality into three piles and decide how much each is worth.The talk often turns to Finland, which, for Afghan fur traders, is another name for the big leagues. Only traders who amass 20,000 pelts generally go on to Helsinki\u2019s fur auctions. Those who have been there describe to those who have not a country of unimaginably cold winters, of people who refuse to take bribes, and of angry animal rights activists.\u201cThey started shouting: \u2018Go back home! Why do you kill these animals?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Amin Tawakaly, a second-generation Afghan fur trader, recalled, describing the protesters who once confronted him outside his Helsinki hotel. \u201cThey were shouting in Finnish, so I had to ask what they were saying.\u201dNewborn karakul lambs are valued above other breeds for the luster and tight, soft curls of their fur, which form mesmerizing patterns and curlicues. But within a day or two of birth, a lamb\u2019s fur grows woolier and loses its value.A decision is made quickly whether to slaughter the lamb or raise it for its meat and wool, with shepherds weighing how much rain and grass they believe will be available that year. Usually about half of the lambs will be killed for their pelts.It is not only European sensibilities that are offended by the killing of the lambs. The Taliban, when they were in power in Afghanistan, tried to clamp down on the trade as well, particularly in the cruelest top end of it: pelts from lambs that have not yet been born, requiring the killing of pregnant ewes to harvest. Experts estimate they make up less than 10 percent of the pelts sold.Mr. Tawakaly even empathized with his Finnish hecklers to some degree. As a child, he dreaded the slaughter of lambing season and once ran away with a newborn lamb, hoping to save it.\u201cAfter two days, my father caught me and he killed it,\u201d Mr. Tawakaly said, with a half-smile, half-grimace. \u201cIt was his business, and I couldn\u2019t stop him.\u201dFor decades, the Central Asian karakul trade continued to thrive, but suddenly plummeted after its peak in the 1970s. Upheaval in Afghanistan and the broader region was part of the crash, but so were global tastes and changes in the fur trade.But if the West has in some part forgotten about karakul sheep, the shepherds of northern Afghanistan have continued to hold them in the same high regard as always. Some zealous shepherds tie banners of red cloth to the shaggy wool on the sheeps\u2019 backs, or even directly paint the fur red \u2014 a shield against celestial forces, some say.\u201cThat\u2019s for their protection, so the stars at night won\u2019t clash and make the rams ill,\u201d Mohammad Hussain, a graying shepherd, 65 years old, explained as his flock nibbled on grass and small yellow flowers, amid a wind so strong that it swept birds backward when they took to the air.Although karakul has a far smaller share of the fur market than fox and mink, it has been growing in recent years, said Kari Huotari, a manager at Saga furs, the major Finnish fur auction operation.In the last quarter of 2014, Afghanistan exported $3.6 million worth of karakul pelts to Finland.In Mazar-i-Sharif, most of the pelts pass through the marble-floored office of Sayed Mohammad Sultani, the largest Afghan fur exporter. With a karakul hat perched on his head and wearing a blazer over a flowing shalwar kameez, Mr. Sultani kept a close watch on the sorting process on a recent morning.Nearby, one of his employees picked up the top pelt from the stack and ran his fingers on both sides to test for softness and thinness. The man then held it in his outstretched hands and regarded it as if he were farsighted, needing to see it at a distance to know what he held.Then the man tossed it casually into the pile of middle-quality furs. Each of the furs there will fetch about 1,200 afghanis, or about $21, from Mr. Sultani, the exporter.Mr. Sultani explained that he insisted on being present to make sure his employees did not place mediocre furs in the highest-quality pile, either as a favor to the trader who had brought them or as part of a secret deal to split the proceeds.Surveying the operation, he declared, to an audience of Afghan fur traders and a reporter, what a relief it was to do business with the Finnish.\u201cThe Finnish people are very honest,\u201d Mr. Sultani said. He reached that conclusion through an experiment of sorts: \u201cOne time I offered to bribe the person in charge\u201d of the karakul auction in Finland for his customer list, he recounted, trying to cut out the auction house so he might sell directly to the customers.\u201cI offered him 100,000 euros,\u201d Mr. Sultani recounted, about $108,000. An impressed note entered his tale as he recalled that the Finnish auctioneer refused.Jawad Sukhanyar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sale of Cirque du Soleil Aims to Open Doors in China", "Date": "2015-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 Like many a Vegas act, Cirque du Soleil had become a bit flabby and pass\u00e9. But a group of investors is betting that China \u2014 and more important, its growing demand for Western entertainment \u2014 may be an answer to the circus troupe\u2019s midlife ennui.On Monday, a consortium of private equity investors led by TPG agreed to buy Cirque du Soleil for 1.5 billion Canadian dollars, a purchase that will pave the way for the company to expand into China.One of the buyers, Fosun of China, is heavily invested in entertainment and travel businesses, including the recent purchase of Club Med. The plan is to open a Cirque office in China.Investors and companies around the globe are trying to capitalize on the swelling leisure spending by China\u2019s growing middle class. The Walt Disney Company is building a $5.5 billion theme park resort in Shanghai. Several American movie studies, including Lionsgate, Studio 8 at Sony Pictures and STX Entertainment, have formed joint ventures with Chinese players. On Sunday, Dick Cook, a former chairman of Walt Disney Studios, announced the formation of a movie company in partnership with the Chinese conglomerate Citic Guoan Group.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at an entertainment boom in China,\u201d said Robert Cain, a film producer from Los Angeles who has done business there for about 25 years. \u201cIt\u2019s really underdeveloped.\u201dCirque \u2014 which merges elements of dance, performance art and high-technology stagecraft with traditional circus acrobatics \u2014 has struggled to break into the fast-growing Chinese market.In 2012, a lavish Cirque production in Macau closed prematurely because of poor attendance. Chinese gamblers, unlike their counterparts in Las Vegas, where Cirque has eight permanent shows running, don\u2019t have much interest in entertainment.L. Patrick Leroux, a professor at Concordia University in Montreal who founded an academic group that researches circuses, said that shorter-run Cirque shows presented in other Chinese cities have also struggled. Part of the problem, he said, is that the Cirque\u2019s traditional formula is just not to Chinese tastes.He says that Cirque usually focuses heavily on New Age narratives, often about the plight of a common man or woman. Instead, the Chinese tend to prefer shows that feature large numbers of performers, where the acrobatics \u201care choreographed and very precise.\u201d Several Chinese circuses, Mr. Leroux said, have combined those elements with Cirque\u2019s style to create successful shows.The investors did not offer many specifics about their plans in China, instead speaking to their global ambitions. \u201cWe are excited about the opportunity to bring our global platform of resources and know-how to propel the growth of Cirque\u2019s unique brand, content and capabilities around the world,\u201d David Trujillo, a partner at TPG, said in a statement.Joshua B. Grode, a lawyer with Irell & Manella in Los Angeles who has been involved in movie deals in China, said that TPG and Fosun were most likely attracted by both Cirque\u2019s high brand recognition in the West as well as the prospect of a China expansion. \u201cYou have a growing middle class and that middle class starts to have the beginnings of disposable income, how do you capture that?\u201d he said. \u201cOne approach is to bring in recognized brands and have them do what they do without having to learn it.\u201dThe sale will be politically sensitive in Quebec, where Cirque is based and where it is a major employer. In a less prominent case in 2012, the province effectively blocked a deal for Lowe\u2019s to buy a Quebec-based home repair company.By including Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, the provincial pension and investment fund, as a minority partner, the new owners hope to block that kind of problem. The founder, Guy Lalibert\u00e9, will also maintain a stake. The deal will include guarantees that the business headquarters and \u201ccenter for creative and artistic services\u201d remain in Montreal.Mr. Lalibert\u00e9, who started in the business as a busker and fire breather, opened Cirque three decades ago with a grant from the provincial government. The company now has 17 elaborate productions playing in North and South America as well as Europe. And in recent years it has become as closely associated with Las Vegas as Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. once were.Last year, Cirque established a theatrical division to develop shows for Broadway. That division is now teaming with NBC on a live musical broadcast of \u201cThe Wiz,\u201d and hopes that broadcast will transfer to the stage.The path to a sale started more than eight years ago as the global economy started to stumble.In 2008, Cirque sold a stake to a group of Dubai investors. The investors, the real estate company Nakheel and Istithmar World Capital, would provide the funds to further Cirque\u2019s international expansion.At the same time, Mr. Lalibert\u00e9 stepped back from daily management of Cirque to spend time with his family and focus on personal endeavors including a spaceflight aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule.When the global financial crisis hit, and the Dubai investors failed to come up with the necessary funds, Mr. Lalibert\u00e9 bought back their 20 percent stake.Cirque struggled, as some new shows failed. \u201cFor the first time, after 25 years of constant growth, we went through a crisis,\u201d Mr. Lalibert\u00e9 said.A closing forced by the 2011 tsunami in Japan eventually led to the shutdown of a major production there. Other shows around the world did not attract sufficient audiences, or were so costly that profits were minimal. Its New York efforts have largely faltered; the 2010 production of \u201cBanana Shpeel\u201d at the Beacon Theater was a flop, and then a production of \u201cZarkana,\u201d at Radio City Music Hall, ran only two summers, instead of the anticipated five.In 2012, Mr. Lalibert\u00e9 returned to active management, and ordered a strategic review. The company cut roughly $100 million in annual costs, including laying off 400 employees.During the news conference, Cirque\u2019s new chairman, Mitch Garber, a Quebec businessman with close ties to TPG and Mr. Lalibert\u00e9, described the company as \u201cvery profitable.\u201d Last year, Mr. Lalibert\u00e9 said Cirque had annual revenues of 850 million Canadian dollars.\u201cThis is by no means a rebuilding acquisition,\u201d Mr. Garber said.An article on Tuesday about private equity investors\u2019 agreeing to buy Cirque du Soleil misspelled the surname of a lawyer involved in movie deals in China who noted the potential for Cirque to expand there. He is Joshua B. Grode, not Grod.Brooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles and Michael Paulson from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Law Schools and Industry Show Signs of Life, Despite Forecasts of Doom", "Date": "2015-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorLaw school enrollment has plummeted to the lowest level in decades. If a bottom has been reached, is now a good time to go to law school?Some say no \u2014 not now and possibly never. The legal market, they argue, has fundamentally changed, meaning that many of the legal jobs of years past are gone forever.Several new studies, however, point to signs of vigorous life in the legal job market, at least toward the higher end.The smaller classes will begin graduating this year and continue to shrink through 2018. Fewer lawyers are likely to mean better first-job numbers, assuming the employment market does not keep declining.And indeed, green shoots can be seen in the legal industry.At the top law schools, things are returning to the years before the financial crisis. Last year, 93.2 percent of the 645 students of the Georgetown Law class of 2013 were employed. Sixty percent of the 2013 graduates were in the private sector with a median starting salary of $160,000. The top 10 schools have even higher employment rates for the class of 2010, and employment statistics for 2014 are expected to rise. (Full disclosure: I teach at one of those top 10 schools and so am biased here.)This is not to say that things are all rosy. The National Association for Law Placement found that in 2013, only 86.4 percent of law school graduates were still in school or had a job, down from a 25-year high of 91.9 percent in 2010. The association also noted a shift in employment from big firm jobs to lower-paid jobs at small firms as well as to jobs that did not require a law degree.Her solution is to turn away from legal scholarship and reduce professor research budgets to further lower tuition.Never mind the fact that not a single law school has closed so far or that law schools have been racing to shed professors and staff as well as tuition. The University of Iowa, Roger Williams University, Brooklyn Law School, Pace University, Penn State and others have cut tuition, while faculty buyouts have become more frequent. Sticker price discounts on even reduced tuition are common.The most compelling argument against going to law school is a structural one. Yes, the job market goes in cycles and we may be at the beginning of an upswing, but, the argument goes, the market itself has been transformed.Big firms are quite profitable, but in exchange for the profitability, there is more hard work and uncertainty about job security, even for partners.Still, it is hard to see lawyers going away in the United States economy. Whether or not you like it, their importance is greater now in terms of filling needs for compliance and regulation.So, there will be disruptions, but this is likely to be a case of lawyers shifting from law firms to corporate departments and compliance becoming its own industry. Solo practice, meanwhile, will become more difficult because of automation. Again, these changes are likely to hit students at lower-tier schools harder than those graduating from the top schools.Twenty years from now, whether the economy is up or down, there will still be lawyers, and plenty of them.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "Eurozone Ministers Admonish Greece for Slow Progress on Overhauls", "Date": "2015-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIGA, Latvia \u2014 Eurozone officials sharply criticized the Greek government on Friday for moving too slowly on steps to overhaul the country\u2019s economy that they say would be necessary to get debt relief and to avoid a default.The comments, expressed as finance ministers assembled here in the Latvian capital, were some of the strongest signs yet of rising concerns about the economic situation in Greece and the commitment of the country\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, to address it.Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, which is one of Greece\u2019s biggest creditors, warned that \u201ctime is running out\u201d for resolving the Greek standoff.Hans Joerg Schelling, the Austrian finance minister, told reporters that the standoff with Greece \u201ccannot continue like this\u201d and that he was growing \u201cannoyed.\u201dPeter Kazimir, the Slovakian finance minister, said, \u201cWe talk, talk, and the substance is missing.\u201dA potential default by Greece is the biggest near-term risk to the European economy, which has begun a tentative recovery after a prolonged sovereign debt crisis that nearly sank the euro at the beginning of the decade. Yet the meeting on Friday yielded no concrete plans to accelerate the talks, and Mr. Varoufakis gave no sign of yielding to pressure.\u201cWe are striving to come to an agreement with the institutions regarding promises and a plan that we can take to the Greek people, and that we can ask the Greek people to fall fully behind,\u201d Mr. Varoufakis told a news conference after the meeting.The frustration with Greece is boiling over more than two months after the international lenders gave Athens until late June to present plans for reforms that would both ease austerity and overhaul its economy.The lack of agreement on those plans means European lenders will not release the next allocation of bailout money \u2014 a 7.2-billion-euro, or $7.5 billion, payment \u2014 to keep the Greek government running and avoid a potential default.Mr. Dijsselbloem said it was up to Mr. Varoufakis and his government to present more ambitious proposals, noting that the next scheduled gathering of the Eurogroup would be on May 11, a day before Greece must pay \u20ac750 million to the International Monetary Fund as part of its loan agreements.There was \u201ca great sense of urgency around the room,\u201d acknowledged Mr. Dijsselbloem.As negotiations have continued between Greece and representatives of its creditors in recent weeks \u2014 meetings separate from the periodic gatherings of the finance ministers \u2014 the two sides are said to remain divided on significant issues. Greece has insisted that it cannot cut pensions any further or accept creditors\u2019 demands for a budget that would require a relatively high primary surplus \u2014 a surplus when debt repayments are not taken into account.Greek officials have insisted that these issues are \u201cred lines\u201d that cannot be crossed, and Mr. Varoufakis underscored them in his comments to reporters in Riga.Some of the antagonism between the Eurogroup and Greece stems from continuing disagreement over whether lenders can conduct fact-finding at Greek ministries in Athens, to verify the true state of the country\u2019s finances, for example, rather than meeting in hotels with Greek officials.A Finance Ministry official in Athens on Friday, speaking only on the condition of anonymity because of the political tensions surrounding the discussions, said that the Greek government was \u201cnot bluffing\u201d in opposing tough measures and was intent on protecting the country\u2019s interests.Mr. Varoufakis, speaking separately to Greek reporters in Riga on Friday said that the country had submitted a new, revised list of reforms at a discussion between deputy finance ministers this week \u2014 but that the document had not been presented to the Eurogroup for procedural reasons that he derided as unnecessarily complicated. He accused eurozone officials of \u201cundermining tactics\u201d and \u201cnegativism\u201d and said the climate in Friday\u2019s meeting had been tense, although he denied reports by some news media that officials had verbally attacked him.Mr. Varoufakis told the Greek reporters that the country was prepared to push the deadlines on the debt deliberations: \u201cThere is a negotiation where you have 30 days to reach a deal with someone. Why do it on the 20th day when you can continue and push for something better on the 21st? Or the 22nd? You keep going until the 30th.\u201dBut Mr. Draghi of the European Central Bank, appearing alongside Mr. Dijsselbloem at their news conference, warned Greece: \u201cTime is running out.\u201d\u201cThere can\u2019t be an agreement if people don\u2019t have an adequate process to assess, quantify policy measures,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.As the crisis drags on, one big concern is the ability of Greek banks to stay afloat. Mr. Draghi said that the European Central Bank\u2019s emergency financing for Greek banks should continue as long as they were \u201csolvent and have adequate collateral.\u201d But he also warned that \u201ca change in the environment\u201d could force the central bank to make that financing more expensive for the Greek banks.Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}

The country even played a hand in producing the first African-American president of the United States.But her short life also tracked the disaster next door. Just as Ms. Githakwa was taking baby steps, Somalia was imploding. Its government had collapsed. Its economy flatlined. Militant groups flooded the streets. Many children born in Somalia at this time did not get to go to school; they picked up guns.Kenya and Somalia \u2014 two nations that achieved independence around the same time and share a border \u2014 could not have been headed in more opposite directions.\u201cWe had no idea what was happening over there,\u201d said Dennis Mwaura, one of Ms. Githakwa\u2019s friends. \u201cSomalia wasn\u2019t something we studied in school. We didn\u2019t think about it much \u2014 until this.\u201dBut this was the first time they specifically went after Kenya\u2019s students. The gunmen were about the same age as their victims, officials said.On Friday, Kenya began to bury its dead. This weekend will be a long one. Slow processions of freshly washed vehicles will chug into just about every corner of this country, coming to rest in front of country churches.So many of the students represented a life their parents never dared dreaming of.\u201cMy son, he was going to run a factory,\u201d said Rex Chagwi, the father of a young man named Newton, who was killed in the massacre. \u201cMe,\u201d he said, laughing, \u201cI didn\u2019t even get past seventh grade.\u201dMany of the slain students were the first ones from their villages to make it to university. On Friday, hundreds of people drifted up the muddy road into the church that was holding the funeral for Ms. Githakwa (pronounced gee-THA-kwa). It was as if the entire village were there, sitting quietly in white plastic chairs.Education is prized in Kenya. Few take it lightly. It represents a ticket to a new life. Families literally mortgage the farm to pay for tutors and boarding schools to give their children a leg up on the high school exams that can determine the future.\u201cI sold sugar cane. I sold our cows,\u201d said Rosina Wanda, whose daughter Selpha was killed at the school. \u201cNow,\u201d she started to say and looked down at a picture of her girl in her hands.She could not finish her words. Ms. Wanda\u2019s face went blank; she was standing at a funeral home in Nairobi, the capital, about to set off for her town of Kakamega, with a long wooden box holding her daughter\u2019s body.Garissa University College, in a thorny frontier town near the Somali border, drew students from the entire country. The 800 or so studying at the university were assigned there by a national board.Ms. Githakwa\u2019s family revealed at her funeral on Friday that she had actually tried to transfer to a different school because of security fears. But in the words of an uncle, the national board\u2019s decision was \u201cvery difficult to unlock.\u201dShe had abruptly come home at least once, not during a vacation, to her farm in central Kenya because of terrorism warnings. The town of Garissa had been hit several times before this attack.\u201cBut that\u2019s what you have to know about Jojo,\u201d Mr. Mwaura said, using her nickname, which means the loved one. \u201cJojo was determined. She wasn\u2019t going to let anyone scare her away.\u201dStanding barely five feet tall, thin, with caramel colored skin, she wore a silver rosary necklace that never came off. Many of her friends think the Shabab might have seen that.\u201cShe was executed because of her strong Catholic faith,\u201d her funeral program said.According to Kenyan officials, the four Shabab gunmen burst into the university at dawn on April 2 and split into teams of two. They moved dorm to dorm, room to room, selecting Christians to kill.Though police officers and infantry soldiers quickly had the university surrounded, many Kenyans are outraged that it took a team of specially trained commandos more than eight hours to arrive because they had to wait for an aircraft in Nairobi. The authorities said the commandos ended the siege in about 15 minutes, killing all four gunmen, raising questions of whether more lives could have been easily saved.Ms. Githakwa was shot while still in bed, her family said. She was hit three times, once in the neck and twice in the chest. Her friends and family shuffled past her coffin for one last look. Her head rested on a lace pillow, a thin scarf around her neck. Her makeup was thick. Her sister leaned over the coffin and wailed.The anger seemed to grow as the funeral went on.\u201cIt\u2019s time to call a spade a spade,\u201d said Moses Kuria, a member of Parliament.The Kenyan government is clearly struggling with how to respond to the massacre, the gravest terrorist attack since the 1998 bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi, which killed more than 200 people, the vast majority of them Kenyans.On Thursday, in of front of a crowd of grieving relatives, a police commander said that Kenyan civilians, if they ever fall into the hands of armed militants, should fight back so they are not killed \u201clike cockroaches.\u201dThey started out as resistance fighters, fighting Ethiopian troops and winning some genuine support inside Somalia. They went on to take over much of the country, backing Somalia\u2019s transitional government into a small corner of the capital and imposing their harsh brand of Islam on Somali civilians at will.But they have lost much of their territory, many of their fighters and most of their money. And after being scolded by Osama bin Laden for killing too many Muslims in Somalia with indiscriminate suicide bombs, the Shabab shifted to targeting Christians. Kenya is majority Christian, and its border is notoriously porous.On Friday afternoon, Ms. Githakwa was laid to rest. Her grave sits under a banana tree, the hillsides all around steep and quilted with rows of crops \u2014 pineapples, beans, coffee and tea.\u201cThis is the way, this is the way to heaven,\u201d people sang.A light drizzle began to fall and people praised the rain. It was the beginning of the rainy season. The clumps of earth shoveled onto the coffin fell quietly, damp and soft.Advertisement"}

This was going to be awkward.One student surveyed her red nails while a classmate checked his cellphone. When the discussion turned to masturbation, a girl pointed across the room toward a boy who was already chortling, and then she started to cover her own giggles by cupping a hand over her mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s O.K. to laugh,\u201d said the instructor, 29-year-old Andreas Beck Kronborg, who looked young enough to be an older brother. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about stuff that\u2019s embarrassing.\u201dIt is all part of a not-so-subtle push in Europe to encourage people to have more babies. Denmark, like a number of European countries, is growing increasingly anxious about low birthrates. Those concerns have only been intensified by the region\u2019s financial and economic crisis, with high unemployment rates among the young viewed as discouraging potential parents.\u201cFor many, many years, we only talked about safe sex, how to prevent getting pregnant,\u201d said Marianne Lomholt, the national director of Sex and Society. \u201cSuddenly we just thought, maybe we should actually also tell them about how to get pregnant.\u201dThe demographic shift is more pressing in Europe than almost any other major region, save Japan. There are an estimated 28 Europeans 65 or older for every 100 residents ages 20 to 64, almost twice the world average, according to the United Nations, and compared with 24.7 for the United States. By the end of the century, the United Nations expects the European figure to double.But there is not a consensus about the impact of demographics. Some see a natural maturing of developed societies. Others see disaster ahead, because with fewer workers and more retirees, the active work force faces an increased burden to sustain social programs.\u201cThe policy agenda is much more complicated than people often think,\u201d said Hans Timmer, chief economist for Europe and Central Asia at the World Bank. \u201cThere is this opportunity for higher per capita income, even if overall income is not growing as fast as in other countries.\u201dIn some countries, the issue can have a broad effect on policy debates.\u201cIf you listen to the German argument \u2014 why Germany doesn\u2019t want to have a larger budget deficit now to stimulate the economy \u2014 the argument they are always saying is that Germany has a very bad demographic outlook so they don\u2019t want to burden future generations,\u201d Mr. Darvas said.\u201cThe reaction was very positive,\u201d said Eva Lundgren, head of marketing at Spies, which is part of the Thomas Cook group. She added that the frequent Danish media coverage of the issue made it a natural topic to work with. \u201cThere has been for some years now some anxiousness about how we are going to support the growing elderly mass of people,\u201d she said.Christine Antorini, the Danish education minister, said in a statement that the government was now seeking \u201ca stronger focus on a broad and positive approach to health and sexuality, where sexual health covers both joys and risks associated with sexual behavior.\u201dPerhaps all of the attention is starting to bear fruit. New statistics show about a thousand more births last year than the year before, the first increase in the Danish birthrate in four years.\u201cI cannot say it is because of us,\u201d Ms. Lomholt of Sex and Society said, laughing. \u201cWe have just started having a focus on it.\u201dSigne Lene Christiansen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before Dangers at Sea, African Migrants Face Perils of a Lawless Libya", "Date": "2015-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a detention center in the Abu Salim area of Tripoli, Libya, dozens of migrants captured at sea were among about 300 men housed in two dimly lit, 50-by-10-yard concrete bunkers. The pads they slept on covered every inch of the floors, and bedbugs swarmed around them.Finally, in the dark of night, a rubber dinghy ferried the two boys, Hermon Angosom and Efrem Fitwi, out to a creaking fishing boat jammed with more than 200 others, including 39 children \u2014 the youngest a 2-year-old in the arms of his mother.Both cried. \u201cWe were afraid of the boat,\u201d Hermon recounted impassively.The boys had joined the unceasing flow of Arab and African migrants who are churned through the lawlessness of post-Qaddafi Libya and spewed out into the Mediterranean \u2014 more than 170,000 last year and at least as many expected this year.Others from across Africa pay desert smugglers to carry them to the Libyan coast just for a chance to get to Europe and the better lives they imagine there.Most are ferried blindly through Libya by armed gangs under the protection of powerful militias. Some fail to make it out of Libyan waters and end up stuck in a hellish limbo, unable to return home and trapped in the country\u2019s chaos. Many are not that lucky.But many still pay for the chance, two smugglers said in separate interviews.\u201cThe Africans are seeing death in front of their eyes\u201d because of the abuse and violence of the Libyan militias, one smuggler said, sipping a cappuccino at a harborside cafe in Tripoli, the capital, and speaking on the condition of anonymity because his trade is a crime.\u201cEven if there is a 99 percent chance that they are going to die at sea, they are still going to do it,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they are just fed up.\u201dThe smugglers have become increasingly cynical about their human freight.\u201cMost smugglers do not care about God,\u201d the smuggler said, \u201cso they just throw a lot of migrants inside the boat \u2014 the more, the better for them.\u201dHe insisted that he had never lost a passenger, but his assessment of the dangers seemed at odds with the death toll. \u201cIt is well known that the Italian boats save everybody,\u201d he said.\u201cA force on the sea will only save the migrants,\u201d one smuggler said. \u201cThe problem is in the harbors of Libya.\u201dBut the Libyan Coast Guard is practically useless. Coast guard officials responsible for most of the coastline where the smuggling occurs say that equipment failures have prevented them from carrying out an operation for more than three months, and at least one captain said he feared retribution by smugglers.Some depart from the rocky coastline of Tripoli itself, not far from the coast guard station, using inflatable boats to ferry migrants to waiting ships.The engine of the boat carrying Hermon and Efrem, the Eritrean 8-year-olds, faltered almost immediately, adults who traveled with them said. They floated at sea for seven hours, until a Libyan fishing boat spotted them.Since then, the boys have been living for a week among three dozen parentless Eritrean boys ages 8 to 16 in a makeshift detention center in a former school, all sleeping on thin mattresses that cover the concrete floor in a bare, dimly lit room with a primitive toilet in the corner.They are allowed outside for about two hours a day, according to other imprisoned migrants and detention officials, in short periods after each of three basic meals \u2014 rice or macaroni, with a rare piece of potato or meat, but never a fruit or vegetable.There were about 17 times as many refugee deaths from January to April this year as there were during the same period last year.\u201cIf we stay here, we have to be able to play soccer or something,\u201d Efrem pleaded.At the shortest distance, the western end of the Libyan coast is just 290 miles from the Italian island of Lampedusa, and emigration by sea has been a dream for years. But under Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s rule, the two smugglers said, the price of passage for one migrant ran as high as $5,000 because of the cost of evading \u2014 or more likely bribing \u2014 the security forces.That price has fallen as low as $1,600 in recent weeks, according to smugglers and migrants around Tripoli. Dark-skinned Africans sail for less than lighter-skinned Moroccans, Syrians and Tunisians, smugglers said, because the latter are assumed to have more money.Cramming 200 or more migrants into a boat at $1,600 a head means more than $320,000, but the smugglers insist that there is a heavy overhead, mainly for bribing militias.\u201cEverything is expensive,\u201d one smuggler said.Transporting migrants by road requires a bribe of more than $100 at each local militia checkpoint for each truck carrying 15 to 20 migrants. (Some migrants from other countries said they had paid as much as $1,600 just for the ride from Sudan to the Libyan coast at Ajdabiya and then west to the smuggling ports.)A smuggler might spend as much as $5,000 a month to rent a crowded collection house where he can keep migrants while they wait to depart, paying a premium to the landlord because of the risk of retribution if the use is exposed. Smugglers must also pay guards.And it often costs as much as $20,000 a month to pay a local militia chief for the permission to use a secure departure point \u2014 \u201cif he is powerful,\u201d the smuggler said.A rubber boat to ferry groups of 20 migrants to a waiting vessel can cost $4,000, and a boat that holds 250 migrants for a one-way voyage can run up to $80,000. (Boat makers charge smugglers a premium, they complain.)An Egyptian or Tunisian captain for the boat might get $5,000 to $7,000, and blend in with the migrants to avoid responsibility if the boat is stopped, according to the smugglers. About $800 buys a satellite telephone that the captain can use to call the Red Cross when the boat reaches international waters, to expedite pickup by the Italian Coast Guard.Some traffickers sell life jackets to the migrants for about $40 each, one smuggler said, but about 80 percent do not bother. Others \u201csay they will give life jackets, but don\u2019t,\u201d the smuggler said, shrugging.Both smugglers all but laughed at the notion that any Libyan authority might deter them. \u201cEverything is open \u2014 the deserts and the seas,\u201d said another smuggler based in Tripoli.At the Tripoli coast guard unit, in charge of most of the coastline where the smuggling occurs, equipment breakdowns this year have prevented any patrols from going to sea since January, said the operations director, Sobhi Bishr. \u201cWe have only one rubber dinghy.\u201dMigrants picked up in Libyan waters are sent to a network of primitive detention centers. Most of the others held in the centers are dark-skinned Africans who have been turned in by Libyan militiamen acting as police officers. The Libyans accuse them of entering the country illegally or committing a crime.But the migrants say that armed Libyans stop them at checkpoints or invade the crowded apartments they share to rob them of their savings and then turn them in. Many accuse the Libyans of raping migrant women, but there are no courts to adjudicate such claims.At a detention site in the Abu Salim area of Tripoli, dozens of migrants captured at sea were among about 300 men housed in two dimly lit, 50-by-10-yard concrete bunkers stinking of urine and sweat. The pads they slept on covered every inch of the floors, and bedbugs swarmed around them. Each room had two toilets in the corner, and a trash-strewn cement trough with four spigots was the only means of washing their clothes or themselves.Some said they had spent two months or more here or in similar centers, although they are sometimes hired as day laborers and returned at night.\u201cWe are like slaves,\u201d said Abu Bakr Dixon, 34, a Gambian held at the Zawiyah detention center. He had survived the capsizing of his migrant boat by clinging to an empty barrel with a friend until they were rescued; at least 61 others with him drowned.Col. Milud Jummah, the official in charge of the Abu Salim center, directed men from one of the rooms to kneel in tight rows in the courtyard \u2014 a chance to get some sunlight, he said. Rows of barbed wire blocked off most of the outdoor space, and armed guards prohibited the migrants from moving around.\u201cDo not expect them to be normal humans,\u201d Colonel Jummah said, explaining the heavy restrictions.The migrants are ostensibly awaiting repatriation to their home countries, and the International Organization for Migration recently helped Senegal bring back about 400. But detention officials said Senegal was an exception. Many African countries have shut down their embassies in Libya or simply neglect their migrants. Eritrea considers them defectors and thus criminals.A more common exit involves the payment of a $500 or $1,000 bribe to the jailers by a migrant or his family and friends, according to migrants and several Libyan officials. Often, smugglers help transmit bribes from a migrant\u2019s distant family members and then sell a second seat to the same passenger. One consequence is that the detention system only increases the determination of many migrants to escape Libya as soon as possible. One smuggler said he often saw repeat customers.At the Zawiyah detention center, Hermon and Efrem appeared to feel the same way. Both boys said they had sneaked away without telling their parents. They said siblings who had already made the trip by boat to Italy from Libya had managed to send money for smugglers to bring their younger brothers to join them.None of the roughly three dozen Eritrean boys had any idea how they might get out of the detention center or what their future might hold. But when asked if they wanted to return home to their parents, the answer was unanimous.\u201cWe want to go to Italy,\u201d they said.Yaseen Kanuni contributed reporting from Zawiyah, and Omar Khaled from Tripoli, Libya.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was fined once, twice, three and four times. Finally, after Microsoft paid more than $3 billion, Europe left it alone.Microsoft has links, to varying degrees, with the three initial complainants that sparked the antitrust investigation into Google. And Microsoft\u2019s activity gained momentum as a new European government re-energized the investigation. Last month, Microsoft played an important role in a delegation of American companies that met with the United States ambassador here, essentially asking him to let Google fend for itself against European regulators.The main battle is now in Europe, where the two companies are fighting what could be called an away game, thousands of miles from their American headquarters. Policy makers are alarmed that Google\u2019s European market share is roughly 90 percent in many countries, even greater than it is in America.\u201cMicrosoft is doing its best to create problems for Google,\u201d said Manfred Weber, the chairman of the European People\u2019s Party, the center-right party that is the largest voting bloc in the European Parliament.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting. Ten years ago Microsoft was a big and strong company,\u201d he added. \u201cNow they are the underdog.\u201dNone of this is to suggest that Google doesn\u2019t face serious questions about its business practices. Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, said in a news conference on Wednesday that \u201cin its general interest search results, Google artificially favors its own comparison shopping service\u201d to the detriment of rivals. \u201cThis constitutes an abuse.\u201dShe said the commission was continuing to investigate whether Google improperly copied other companies\u2019 content and used exclusivity deals to prevent businesses from using rival advertising platforms. She also formally opened an inquiry in a potent new battleground: how Google deals with competition in its Android operating system for mobile phones.\u201cThe reality in Brussels is that you\u2019re either in the Google camp or the opposite camp, and that goes for companies or advisers or trade associations,\u201d said Thomas Tindemans, the chief executive of the Brussels branch of Hill & Knowlton, the public relations firm. \u201cThis is a phenomenon we\u2019ve seen in the past, when the commission was going after Microsoft.\u201dDavid Howard, Microsoft\u2019s deputy general counsel, said, \u201cWe have been clear all along about our concerns about Google\u2019s business practices and their effects on fair competition.\u201cWe are one of more than 30 complainants, among many others, who have shared similar concerns with regulators hoping that competition will be restored for the benefit of consumers and businesses,\u201d he said.Google has undertaken its own prodigious lobbying effort; its chairman, Eric E. Schmidt, has made appeals to top regulators. And it has disputed that it manipulates its search results or treats competitors unfairly.In a statement, Peter Barron, a Google vice president based in Europe, said: \u201cWe face strong competition from many different sources. Amazon is the leader in online shopping; Booking, Expedia and Priceline are the big players in travel.\u201cPeople have lots of choice online, and that has only increased in recent years \u2014 the tremendous growth of mobile devices underlines the dynamism and constant innovation we see in the online economy.\u201dCiao, a German comparison shopping site, claimed that its agreement to use Google\u2019s search services restricted its ability to do advertising deals with Google\u2019s rivals. The site was bought by Microsoft before the company filed its complaint.The third complainant, the French search company Ejustice.fr, has been advised by Jacques Lafitte. Mr. Lafitte, a Brussels lobbyist, previously served as a top corporate affairs official for Microsoft in Europe.Microsoft and its allies have said there is no orchestrated effort. Mr. Lafitte was adamant in denying any connection to Microsoft. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any relationship with Microsoft for 10 years or more,\u201d he said.Ms. Raff, in a statement on Wednesday, said the European case was \u201cabout ending Google\u2019s ability to manipulate its unprecedented power to its own financial ends and to the detriment of consumers and innovation.\u201dGroups in Microsoft\u2019s employ have spread their wings widely. Burson-Marsteller, a public relations firm, has long worked for Microsoft and Icomp. After Lord Alan Watson, a member of Britain\u2019s House of Lords, retired from Burson in 2007, another Burson executive approached him about taking on a new project. \u201cWhat we want to do is create a type of trade association,\u201d Lord Watson said he was told at the time. \u201cMicrosoft is going to be one of the main sponsors.\u201d The trade group, Icomp, would largely take aim at Google, he was told. Lord Watson is now Icomp\u2019s chairman.At a recent forum at a luxury hotel in London, after a brief introduction by Lord Watson, a variety of executives began complaining about Google. An executive from the Guardian newspaper group said that Google and Facebook had a tight grip on reader data. \u201cWe don\u2019t really like the idea of a one-off levy\u201d by regulators, he said. An executive from the Premier League, the soccer league in Britain, said tech companies were judged by their own rules. \u201cCompetition law doesn\u2019t apply online,\u201d he said. Another attendee called Google a threat to the survival of independent artists. A Yahoo executive told other speakers \u201cwe feel your pain.\u201d\u201dGoogle is going to have to face a very serious and protracted investigation, which I hope very much will lay down new ground rules for the Internet,\u201d Lord Watson said in an interview at his office. If the European case falters, he added, \u201cthen I think Google will be completely unstoppable actually, and it will own the Internet, in effect.\u201dGoogle has not been silent. Officially, its spending on lobbying has tripled since 2010, which is still only a third of what Microsoft spends. But European figures are porous, and companies can exclude the firms they hire related to investigations.The case is now in the hands of Ms. Vestager, who took over as the European Commission\u2019s competition chief in November. After five years and three failed rounds of settlement negotiations by her predecessor, Ms. Vestager has said she wants to take a new tack. And she appears to have succeeded in doing so.\u201cThis has nothing to do with a company being European, American, Russian, Chinese or whatever,\u201d she said on Wednesday. \u201cIf you want to compete in European markets you will have to do that by abiding to European competition rules.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Poles and Russians Meet, Ideals and Profits Clash", "Date": "2015-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOPOT, Poland \u2014 Jan Hermanowicz was not expecting quite this level of reaction when he put a sign on his bucolic beach-side restaurant saying he refused to serve Russians.\u201cI decided to protest because Russia entered Crimea,\u201d the shaggy-haired proprietor explained over a Coca-Cola as he gazed across a furl of dunes and the gray Baltic Sea. \u201cI must say, I am very surprised by all the attention I got.\u201dOther business owners begged him to remove the sign, fearing he would drive away their own Russian customers. A Russian prosecutor threatened him with legal action. Politicians tried fervently to assure Russian visitors that they remained quite welcome.For more than a year, since the Ukraine conflict erupted, European nations have been having an argument among themselves that measures ideals against profits.Some, eager to dissuade President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia from further aggression in Ukraine, argue that the current slate of Western sanctions is a weak tea of halfhearted gestures, intended as much to safeguard Western business interests as to support Kiev. Others fear that alienating Russia will only harm their own country\u2019s economy and argue that maintaining ties is the best way to lure Moscow back into the Western fold.Mr. Hermanowicz\u2019s sign is an example of how that very argument is being played out here, along Poland\u2019s 125-mile border with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.A treaty signed by Polish and Russian officials in Moscow in 2011, and put in place in mid-2012, created a \u201cshort border\u201d program that made it significantly easier for residents living nearby to cross from one side to the other.Even the recent tensions between the two nations \u2014 borne out by heated exchanges between the capitals, growing Polish anxiety about Mr. Putin\u2019s intentions and rising Russian anger over sanctions \u2014 have failed to dampen enthusiasm in either country for the hugely profitable and popular program.\u201cIn my opinion, the West needs to continue its hard line towards Putin, and NATO needs to keep its ability to react,\u201d said Pawel Adamowicz, the mayor of Gdansk. \u201cWe need to make Russians think twice before acting. But at the same time, we need to maintain these relations with ordinary Russians, to distinguish between the people and the regime.\u201dMr. Hermanowicz, 54, has a different view.\u201cFor many business owners, it is more about the money than it is about the idea,\u201d he said. \u201cThey live by the cult of money.\u201dComments, both hostile and supportive, flooded local websites. A few times, he said, Russian customers who were denied service reacted with anger, and twice he had to call the police.So finally Mr. Hermanowicz took down the sheet of paper. But he refuses to remove a large banner that he designed himself showing a glowering Mr. Putin, a pistol in each hand, above a red-hued globe and a pair of goose-stepping soldiers with the legend, \u201cWe Come in Peace \u2014 To Rule Your World.\u201dRussian customers, who used to make up about 7 percent of his clientele, got the message.Under the \u201cshort border\u201d program, Russians in the enclave of Kaliningrad \u2014 surrounded by Poland on the south and Lithuania on the east, with a population of about 950,000 \u2014 who previously needed visas to cross into Poland can apply for permits to visit those parts of Poland nearest the border.And hundreds of thousands have done just that \u2014 1.2 million in 2013 and 1.7 million last year.\u201cThere was some distance between the two countries at the beginning,\u201d said Andrzej Sakson, a sociologist at the Western Institute in Poznan who has studied the border region. \u201cWe are talking about Poland and Russia, after all. But both sides were determined to make some money together and quickly managed to shorten the distance between them.\u201dGreat crowds of Russian shoppers began appearing in stores as far west as Gdansk. Malls, medical clinics, beauticians and lawyers found themselves with new customers and were forced to hire Russian-speaking staff to deal with them. Advertisements in Cyrillic script sprouted on Polish highways.And thousands of Poles signed up for the permits after discovering that gasoline could be had at almost a third of the price in Kaliningrad.\u201cEven Russian vodka is cheaper in Poland,\u201d Mr. Sakson said. \u201cMeanwhile, Poles traveled en masse for cheap gas. So both sides are happy.\u201dIf anything, political and business leaders from both countries are focusing their worries on a recent drop in cross-border traffic \u2014 nearly 31 percent in the first three months of the year compared with the same period last year.This, they stress, was caused by a steep drop in the ruble\u2019s exchange rate, and a dip in the number of working-class Russians making the trip, and not growing antipathy between residents of the two countries.\u201cRussians are the most sought-after customers,\u201d said Mr. Adamowicz, the Gdansk mayor. \u201cThey spend a lot of money. They tip well. When they go back home, they leave a lot of money here.\u201dOfficials from the Russian side are also upbeat, though some notice that Poles have become a little less public about their support for the cross-border program.\u201cI have never heard a single word from my Polish colleagues critical of the program,\u201d said Alexander Karachevtsev, the Russian consul general in Gdansk. \u201cI would say that perhaps some local authorities may not be so enthusiastic about the program at the moment, but they are still very interested in keeping the program going.\u201dBut there have been a handful of incidents speaking to a higher level of tension.\u201cIt has got nothing to do with the political situation and tensions with Russia,\u201d said Miroslawa Aleksandrowicz, a spokesman for the Polish Border Guards. \u201cThe reaction, though, is definitely a reflection of the tension.\u201dAt least one alcohol-fueled fistfight over politics erupted recently in Gdansk, Mr. Adamowicz said. A brick was tossed through the window of a car with Russian plates on a nearby highway.Monika Trzcinska, the mayor of Braniewo, a small town near the border that has profited keenly from the Russian commerce, said there had been an incident involving a Russian customer at a discount store, who was told he could not pay in rubles and replied, \u201cSoon, you will all be using rubles.\u201d This led a Polish customer to step forward and punch him.The Pole was fined, she said.The border program is worthwhile, Mr. Adamowicz said, if only because it brings together ordinary Poles and Russians who may otherwise have never encountered one another.\u201cObviously, we try not to mention the war in Ukraine or Putin\u2019s politics,\u201d he said.The same goes in dealing with business colleagues across the border, said Marcin Lukasiewicz, manager of the Galeria Baltycka, one of the largest shopping malls in Gdansk.\u201cWe say they are misinformed, they say we are misinformed,\u201d Mr. Lukasiewicz said. \u201cBetter just to avoid the subjects and stick to business.\u201dJoanna Berendt contributed reporting from Warsaw.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Private Equity Firm That Grew Too Fast", "Date": "2015-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJonathan M. Nelson, the billionaire media mogul and founder of Providence Equity Partners, enters the room \u2014 limping.The brace on his right leg is a souvenir from his private equity firm\u2019s annual ski outing to Alta, Utah. Mr. Nelson ripped his A.C.L. while heli-skiing. Because Masters of the Universe never just trip.It has been a bumpy few years for Mr. Nelson and Providence. In February, one of the firm\u2019s biggest investments, the security screener Altegrity, filed for bankruptcy in the face of fraud accusations. Providence had its entire $800 million stake wiped out, the largest loss in the firm\u2019s 26-year history. Altegrity was the latest in a string of bad bets for the firm. Last summer, it lost its entire $460 million investment in a for-profit college company after that company faced multiple investigations. Hundreds of millions of dollars were erased when the film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer went bankrupt in 2010. A $675 million stake in an Internet retailer has been written down to zero, as has the $400 million it spent on a Dutch child-care group. The spate of poor investments caused Providence to deliver dismal returns in back-to-back funds. Just days before he was to have knee surgery, Mr. Nelson, 58, sat in a small, dark wood-paneled conference room in the firm\u2019s Rhode Island headquarters. He briefly closed his eyes while pondering what had gone wrong. \u201cWe grew too fast. We were managing too much money,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. \u201cThat was the hallmark of that era, but it doesn\u2019t make me less disappointed in our results.\u201d He acknowledged that the firm made too many investments at precisely the wrong time, in 2007 and 2008, just as the private equity boom was cresting. \u201cThat was an absolute killer,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at our terrible deals, they were done in that time period.\u201d And Providence, which rose to prominence on the strength of its telecom and media holdings, began buying companies outside its area of expertise. \u201cOne of our mistakes was definitely style drift,\u201d Mr. Nelson said, using financial jargon for a firm\u2019s straying from its stated investment style. \u201cAltegrity was a good example of that.\u201dIn the ego-filled world of Wall Street, it is rare to find an executive who readily acknowledges errors, let alone a series of them. But that\u2019s not what Mr. Nelson wants written. Instead, he sees his firm\u2019s story as one of recovery and redemption. The past is past. Providence has owned up to all of its problems and fixed them, he says.\u201cEveryone made mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe key is who learned from it? I like to think we did.\u201dProvidence finds itself at a critical juncture. Despite poor performance in its two prior funds, the firm managed to raise $5 billion in 2013 for its latest vehicle. Some attribute that feat to Mr. Nelson\u2019s gifted salesmanship and earlier track record. Others note Providence continues to benefit from extremely low interest rates, which have forced pension funds and others to seek returns in so-called alternative investments like private equity and hedge funds, which charge higher fees than traditional stock or bond funds. (Private equity firms like Providence invest in companies, mostly with borrowed money, that they hope to later either sell or take public at a profit for themselves and their investors.)Providence\u2019s future very much rests on the success of its current fund. The firm must post strong results, and it will have to do so while beginning to transition to a new generation of leaders. A close look at Providence\u2019s stumbles illustrates the perils of success and serves as a case study for what can happen when an investment firm \u2014 or any company, for that matter \u2014 grows too fast during a bull market and there is too much money chasing expensive deals. Just a decade ago, Providence was one of Wall Street\u2019s hottest firms. Mr. Nelson started it in 1989 and was later joined by Glenn M. Creamer and Paul J. Salem, all three graduates of Brown University and Harvard Business School. The firm reveled in its Rhode Island roots and \u201cstealth mogul\u201d status far from Wall Street and its brand-name rivals. But a succession of hugely profitable telecom investments brought Providence\u2019s partners prodigious wealth and attention. Among its most lucrative deals was VoiceStream Wireless, a company cobbled together through the acquisition of wireless spectrum. In July 2000, just before the telecom sector crashed, VoiceStream agreed to be acquired by Deutsche Telekom for $50 billion.Providence\u2019s timing seemed impeccable. It got in and out of a big bet on competitive local telephone exchange carriers before that market collapsed. Investors in a 1996 fund more than tripled their money after fees. A 2000 fund made nearly two and a half times its investments.The media investor Haim Saban recalled his first meeting with Mr. Nelson in 2003, shortly after he had led a group in a successful bid for a German broadcaster. \u201cI was so impressed by his ideas that, frankly, I reduced my share in the deal and asked the other private equity firms to reduce their shares so Providence Equity could invest,\u201d he said.Providence had established itself as the smartest media and telecom private equity player. That reputation would serve it well as private equity entered its golden age. Providence and its peers became major beneficiaries of a post-Sept. 11 economy of low bond yields and loose lending standards. Institutions, having had their stock portfolios crushed by the dot-com bust and ensuing bear market, began pouring money into private equity. In 2000, Providence oversaw just $3.6 billion. A single fund raised in 2005 amassed $4.26 billion. Two years later, it raised $12 billion more \u2014 in just three months. By 2007, the firm had nearly $21 billion in private equity assets under management. It also started a credit arm, which quickly attracted billions to invest in fixed-income securities.\u201cThe interesting thing about getting bigger is that when you\u2019re in the middle of it, you\u2019ve always been getting bigger. The relative increase was no different than the other ones,\u201d Mr. Nelson said, shrugging. \u201cWe were doubling with every fund.\u201dThe money catapulted Providence from a boutique into a megafund, allowing it to compete for deals with larger firms. Providence charged into the fray, investing half of the $12 billion fund in just two years. This was the apex of buyout mania. Private equity firms, flush with cash, were paying top dollar for companies that would struggle during the coming financial crisis and Great Recession. Providence delved into areas like health care, Internet retailing and child care, often paying hefty sums for companies in sectors in which it had scant experience. \u201cThe risk during this time wasn\u2019t just style drift, it was quality drift,\u201d said Peter Keehn, the head of private equity at Allstate Investments, who wasn\u2019t speaking specifically about Providence. \u201cAfter raising these big funds, if you couldn\u2019t find assets that were exactly what you were dying to own, then you started to look at assets that were close to what you\u2019d like to own.\u201dAs Providence grew, Mr. Nelson looked to expand the firm\u2019s Manhattan offices. The firm was outgrowing its space in the Lever House, a glass-box skyscraper on Park Avenue. (It\u2019s nicknamed \u201cthe leverage house\u201d for the numerous private equity and hedge funds housed there.)Mr. Nelson moved the firm to the swooping tower at 9 West 57th Street, among the world\u2019s most prestigious business addresses. The firm leased the entire 47th\u00a0floor, placing it several floors above rivals like Apollo Global Management (43), Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company (42) and Silver Lake Partners (32). It was hardly a subtle message: Providence had entered the big leagues. In the summer of 2007, Providence struck what would have been the largest buyout deal in history, the $51 billion takeover of BCE, parent of the phone giant Bell Canada. Not long afterward, Mr. Nelson appeared on the cover of Fortune magazine alongside the headline \u201cThe Biggest Deal Ever.\u201d That Fortune issue became a collector\u2019s item \u2014 because the deal never happened. The BCE buyout fell apart in the ensuing credit crisis. Still, during the height of the frothy markets, Providence completed a number of deals, and none was worse than Altegrity.In 2007, Providence paid $1.5 billion for U.S. Investigations Services, a former branch of the federal government. Privatized in the 1990s, it provided background checks for government employees requiring security clearances.Providence began adding related businesses onto USIS to create a bigger, more diverse entity it renamed Altegrity. First came the commercial background-checking firm HireRight. Next, in 2010, it bought the investigative firm Kroll for $1.1 billion.The three business entities coexisted, albeit not always peacefully. Several Altegrity managers interviewed for this article said they butted heads with Providence partners over everything from strategy to acquisitions to sales of business lines.The final straw was a hacking attack on USIS, which led the government to withdraw its contracts. With the loss of that business, and buckling under $1.8 billion in debt, Altegrity filed for bankruptcy protection this February. Providence executives blame events largely outside their control for Altegrity\u2019s failure. But they also all agree the firm shouldn\u2019t have made the deal in the first place. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a particular expertise in that area,\u201d Mr. Nelson acknowledged.Not all of Providence\u2019s investments during the boom were missteps. A $724 million investment in the German cable company Kabel Deutschland netted more than $3 billion. A stake in the AutoTrader Group, an advertising website, returned three times its money. The same holds true for a small education deal, Archipelago Learning.But Providence and its investors are still paying for the firm\u2019s overreaching into areas outside media and technology. The performance of the 2005 fund is abysmal. With an annual return of 3.5 percent after fees, it sits near the bottom of its peer group.The 2007 $12 billion vehicle is also struggling, returning about 6 percent annually. For now, those two funds rank in the bottom quartile of other similarly sized global funds from the same year, according to an analysis by the research firm PitchBook. But some investors expect that performance to improve on potential gains on several investments including Asurion, a cellphone insurer; ZeniMax Media, a video gaming company; and wireless tower companies in India and Latin America. For a lesser private equity player, back-to-back bottom-quartile funds would have spelled a firm\u2019s demise. Providence survived, though raising a new fund was a slog. Several past investors declined, including the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, which had a total of $1 billion invested in the 2005 and 2007 funds, according to the online fund-raising firm Palico.But others, including pension funds in Washington, Florida and Illinois, increased their investments in the new fund. A handful of others, including Florida and the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio, went a step further, taking an ownership stake in Providence itself.\"They have proven over many years their ability to create significant value for their investors,\u201d said Michael Rees, the head of Dyal Capital Partners, in an emailed statement. Dyal, a unit of the investment manager Neuberger Berman, took a stake in Providence last fall.Peter Chernin, the former president of News Corporation, received an investment from Providence in his new company, the Chernin Group. \u201cThere is no one in that arena who is as knowledgeable about media, technology and communications as he is because he\u2019s been focused on it for 30 years,\u201d Mr. Chernin said of Mr. Nelson. Mr. Nelson sounds energized when discussing the future of media. The firm has been betting on demand for premium sports content, leading to investments in Major League Soccer, the company that runs the Ironman triathlon races, and Learfield Sports, which owns rights to college sports programming. While still in its early days, Providence\u2019s 2013 fund has posted annual returns of 20 percent on paper.Like many of the world\u2019s largest private equity companies that started in the 1980s and 1990s, Providence is also dealing with succession issues. A nagging problem it has faced is how to retain top talent when its leaders show no signs of moving on. In recent years, the firm saw talented people leave, some for new jobs, others because they specialized in areas Providence was no longer focusing on. Still others were frustrated that the firm\u2019s leaders, including Mr. Nelson, Mr. Creamer and Mr. Salem, continued to reap much of the profits in the 2013 fund.That is changing. This year, Mr. Creamer announced internally his intentions to take no profits from the next fund. As for Mr. Salem, he is currently on a six-month around-the-world vacation with his family, but he plans to return to his leadership role.Mr. Nelson, who has no intention of stepping down from his chief executive post, has spent the last several years fighting to get his firm back on track from its bungled investments. Meanwhile, competitors like Blackstone and Carlyle have grown ever larger \u2014 selling shares to the public, putting a new generation of leaders in place and morphing into global asset management businesses. From Mr. Nelson\u2019s perspective, the Providence of old has returned. The firm is back to investing in what it knows. He noted that 700 budding financiers applied for just a handful of job openings last year.\u201cThe culture is back to where it used to be in the early days,\u201d Mr. Nelson said, leaning back in his chair and smiling, though in obvious discomfort from his injured knee. \u201cPeople are happy to be here and are proud of the work we\u2019re doing.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Battle Between Strong Dollar and Cheap Gas, the Strong Dollar Is Winning", "Date": "2015-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsThere were two big shifts in global markets in the second half of 2014 that looked likely to shape how the American economy would perform in 2015.Oil prices plummeted last year, leading to cheaper gasoline \u2014 good news for American consumers and companies like airlines and shipping firms that are heavy fuel users. Meanwhile, the dollar soared on global currency markets, making life more difficult for exporters who faced higher costs relative to global competitors.Corporate profitability isn\u2019t the same as overall economic health, of course, and these struggles largely reflect the simple fact that overseas sales of multinational companies are now resulting in lower revenue, when measured in dollars (if Procter & Gamble sells a box of Tide detergent for five euros, for example, that sale was worth $6.85 last summer but only $5.40 today).The question over time is how much the stronger dollar will also reduce American exports, increase imports, and thus prove a drag on job creation and overall growth in the United States. There is evidence that at least half of that equation is happening. Total American exports were 1.4 percent lower in January and February than in the same period of 2014 (many factors beyond currencies can affect exports, though, and imports fell as well).Meanwhile, the cheaper fuel prices that looked likely to offset \u2014 or even overpower \u2014 the negatives that come from a rising dollar aren\u2019t having the punch that many forecasters had expected.Consumers appear to have channeled their savings from cheaper gasoline not into buying other stuff but into, well, savings. That may be good for Americans\u2019 long-term financial prospects, but it\u2019s bad for short-term economic growth. In the second half of 2014, Americans saved 4.7 percent of their income. In January and February, that skyrocketed to 5.7 percent.The bad winter weather in much of the United States is probably a factor in this. The spike in the savings rate may simply be a temporary aberration: People earned their usual incomes, but because of worse-than-usual snow and bitter cold in heavily populated parts of the country, they didn\u2019t go to shopping malls and car dealerships the way they normally would.Still, the retail price of gasoline fell more or less continuously from the start of July 2014 until late January 2015, and even encompassing the entirety of that period, to reduce the effect of the cold winter, there\u2019s not much sign of an uptick in retail sales.For example, in March, retail sales excluding gasoline stations were up 4 percent from a year earlier \u2014 a figure that is below the 5.5 percent gain of the year ended December 2014 and below the 4.7 percent of the year ended July 2014, just before gasoline prices plummeted.Cheaper gasoline may yet create a consumer spending boom, but there\u2019s no real evidence of it in the data so far. And while the winners from the cheaper fuel aren\u2019t acting like winners yet, the losers most certainly are.Companies involved in the drilling of oil and other fuels are pulling back on investment, as you might expect after oil prices fell by half in seven months. And orders for nondefense capital spending excluding aircraft have fallen for six straight months through February (the March numbers are due out Friday morning, and analysts expect a slight gain).\u201cExports and oil and gas, they cast one heck of a shadow,\u201d said Dan Florness, the chief financial officer of the industrial supply company Fastenal, in a recent conference call with investors. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the folks that are directly involved in that business. If you\u2019re in the same geographic area, and the manufacturing pace, the manufacturing heartbeat of that area is weaker, everything else kind of takes a step down.\u201dThis disconnect is weighing on the Federal Reserve, which is trying to decide when to begin raising interest rates after more than six years of holding them near zero. The fact that the negative consequences of a strong dollar have appeared more powerful than the benefits of cheaper oil are a major factor leading some Fed officials to urge greater patience on rate hikes.So almost a third of the way through 2015, the big questions for the economy boil down to these: Will the strong dollar affect only corporate earnings, or will it start to wallop exports more than it has so far? And will Americans start to spend their savings from the gasoline pump?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico on the Brink", "Date": "2015-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialPuerto Rico is in trouble, after years of bad policies, mismanagement, excessive debt and bad luck. Puerto Rican leaders made the situation worse by not investing sufficiently in the economy and by borrowing excessively. Investors eagerly extended loans without properly analyzing the territory\u2019s deteriorating financial health. They did so in large part because interest earned from Puerto Rican government bonds is exempt from federal and state income taxes.Some analysts and bankruptcy experts say that Congress should go even further and allow the government of Puerto Rico to file for bankruptcy. Some also argue that federal lawmakers should appoint a financial control board to oversee the island\u2019s finances; this drastic step may not be warranted yet, but it is worth studying. Puerto Rico is about 1,000 miles from Miami, but it can seem a world apart.

{"Headline": "Can Bitcoin Conquer Argentina?", "Date": "2015-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Money IssueOn the 20th floor, he hustled into an impersonal, windowless office and quickly removed the tools of his trade from his backpack and set them on the desk: locked blue cash box, cellphone and clunky Dell laptop with the same yellow smiley-face sticker that he puts on all his electronics. Then he unbuckled the fanny pack from around his waist, which contained the most important part of his business: bricks of $100 bills and 100-peso notes.This room, rented for the day, was not one of Castiglione\u2019s regular haunts. He mostly drifts among the old cafes in Buenos Aires, where the bow-tie-wearing waiters serve small glasses of seltzer water with each coffee. In his line of business as a money-changer, temporary meeting places are preferred; they make things harder for would-be thieves, whom he has so far avoided. On this Friday in late February, Castiglione had run around the city in his camouflage-patterned sandals, trying to distribute cash to some clients and pick it up from others. Once back in his temporary office, his outdated LG phone alternately chirped, buzzed and sang with incoming text messages and emails.Ordinarily, Castiglione would have help. His 18-year-old daughter, Fiona, often deals with customers, but she was about to give birth to her first child. Her twin brother, Marco, who used to make cash runs, was now focusing on school. So Castiglione was alone, his stress evident in the sweat on his forehead and the agitation on his face. When his business partner, who lives in Rosario, Argentina\u2019s third-largest city, called to ask why he hadn\u2019t taken care of one particularly insistent client, Castiglione erupted in frustration.\u201cIf you want it done faster, you pick up the phone and call her yourself,\u201d he growled in Spanish, before switching to another call.After hanging up, he told me in English: \u201cEverybody wants everything now, and I am just trying to do it. I\u2019m not magical, as people think.\u201dThat afternoon, a plump 48-year-old musician was one of several customers to drop by the rented room. A German customer had paid the musician in Bitcoin for some freelance compositions, and the musician needed to turn them into dollars. Castiglione joked about the corruption of Argentine politics as he peeled off five $100 bills, which he was trading for a little more than 1.5 Bitcoins, and gave them to his client. The musician did not hand over anything in return; before showing up, he had transferred the Bitcoins \u2014 in essence, digital tokens that exist only as entries in a digital ledger \u2014 from his Bitcoin address to Castiglione\u2019s. Had the German client instead sent euros to a bank in Argentina, the musician would have been required to fill out a form to receive payment and, as a result of the country\u2019s currency controls, sacrificed roughly 30 percent of his earnings to change his euros into pesos. Bitcoin makes it easier to move money the other way too. The day before, the owner of a small manufacturing company bought $20,000 worth of Bitcoin from Castiglione in order to get his money to the United States, where he needed to pay a vendor, a transaction far easier and less expensive than moving funds through Argentine banks.The last client to visit the office that Friday was Alberto Vega, a stout 37-year-old in a neatly cut suit who heads the Argentine offices of the American Bitcoin company BitPay, whose technology enables merchants to accept Bitcoin payments. Like other BitPay employees \u2014 there is a staff of six in Buenos Aires \u2014 Vega receives his entire salary in Bitcoin and lives outside the traditional financial system. He orders what he can from websites that accept Bitcoin and goes to Castiglione when he needs cash. On this occasion, he needed 10,000 pesos to pay a roofer who was working on his house.Commerce of this sort has proved useful enough to Argentines that Castiglione has made a living buying and selling Bitcoin for the last year and a half. \u201cWe are trying to give a service,\u201d he said.That mundane service \u2014 harnessing Bitcoin\u2019s workaday utility \u2014 is what so excites some investors and entrepreneurs about Argentina. Banks everywhere hold money and move it around; they help make it possible for money to function as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. But thanks in large part to their country\u2019s history of financial instability, a small yet growing number of Argentines are now using Bitcoin instead to fill those roles. They keep the currency in their Bitcoin \u201cwallets,\u201d digital accounts they access with a password, and use its network when they need to send or spend money, because even with Castiglione or one of his competitors serving as middlemen between the traditional economy and the Bitcoin marketplace, Bitcoin can be cheaper and more convenient than Argentina\u2019s financial establishment. In effect, Argentines are conducting an ambitious experiment, one that threatens ultimately to spread to the United States and disrupt some of the most basic services its banks have to offer.But the wild fluctuations in price \u2014 the value of a Bitcoin has bounced between $70 and $1,200 over the last two years \u2014 have obscured a significant aspect of the currency\u2019s broader potential. Bitcoin digital tokens are part of a new kind of online financial network, which runs on the computers of those who use the virtual currency. People who join and support the network \u2014 hosting its open-source software, serving as record-keepers of sorts \u2014 receive new Bitcoins as they are released in a kind of recurring lottery, thus encouraging user participation. The details of how the network operates can be mind-numbingly complicated, involving lots of advanced math and cryptography, but at the most basic level, the network makes it possible for the first time to send valuable digital money around the world almost instantly, without moving through an intermediary like a bank or credit-card company or a service like PayPal. In a sense, the Bitcoin network was designed to be a financial version of email, which enables messages to be delivered without passing through a national postal service, or like the broader Internet itself, which allows people to publish news and essays without going through a media company. Instead of just delivering words, though, the Bitcoin network makes it possible to deliver money from New York to Shanghai in a matter of minutes without paying any financial institution.The number of Bitcoin users in Argentina is relatively small; it barely registers on most charts of global Bitcoin usage. But Argentina has been quietly gaining renown in technology circles as the first, and almost only, place where Bitcoins are being regularly used by ordinary people for real commercial transactions. A number of large American companies have started accepting Bitcoin payments, but so far there has been little economic incentive for their customers to pay with Bitcoins.In contrast, the best-known Bitcoin start-up in Argentina, BitPagos, is helping more than 200 hotels, both cheap and boutique, take credit-card payments from foreign tourists. The money brought to Argentina using Bitcoin circumvents the onerous government restrictions on receiving money from abroad. Castiglione has some hotel clients, but he says that many of his 800 or so registered customers are freelancers who use Bitcoin to get paid by overseas clients, or companies that want to move money in and out of Argentina. A popular new online retailer, Avalancha, began accepting Bitcoin last summer and has seen the volume of Bitcoin transactions grow steadily since then. Avalancha offers customers a 10 percent discount when they use the virtual currency, because accepting credit cards generally ends up costing Avalancha more than 10 percent as a result of the vagaries of the Argentine financial system. The Bitcoin community in Buenos Aires has been vibrant enough to produce what\u2019s known as the Bitcoin Embassy in the center of the city, a four-story building that serves as the home to eight start-ups whose businesses depends on the Bitcoin network.Bitcoin proponents like to say that the currency first became popular in the places that needed it least, like Europe and the United States, given how smoothly the currencies and financial services work there. It makes sense that a place like Argentina would be fertile ground for a virtual currency. Inflation is constant: At the end of 2014, for example, the peso was worth 25 percent less than it was at the beginning of the year. And that adversity pales in comparison with past bouts of hyperinflation, defaults on national debts and currency revaluations. Less than half of the population use Argentine banks and credit cards. Even wealthy Argentines fear keeping their money in the country\u2019s banks.There was rarely a time during Casares\u2019s youth when Argentina was not enduring some sort of financial crisis. In 1983, after years of inflation, the government created the new peso: each new one was worth 10,000 old pesos. In 1985, the new peso, its value eroded by inflation, was in turn supplanted by the austral, worth 1,000 new pesos. Eventually the government went back to the peso, this time pegged to the dollar, an effort that also failed.\u201cI think I understand economics better than most people because I grew up in Argentina,\u201d Casares, now 41, told me. \u201cI\u2019ve seen every single monetary experiment you can imagine. This is the street-smart economics. Not the complex Ph.D. economics.\u201dOne particular episode is seared in Casares\u2019s memory. In 1984, during the first significant episode of Argentine hyperinflation following the military junta\u2019s loss of power, Casares\u2019s mother came to get him and his two sisters from school one day. His mother carried two grocery bags filled with cash \u2014 the salary she had just been paid. She rushed with Casares and his sisters to the grocery store and made them run through the aisles, grabbing as much food as they could before the prices changed. (An employee walked through the store all day doing nothing but re-pricing the goods on the shelves to keep up with the rapidly changing value of the peso.) After paying at the register, Casares and his sisters ran back for more food to spend the leftover money on. In this hyperinflationary environment, holding on to pesos was the same thing as losing money.Casares is descended from one of Argentina\u2019s old landholding families \u2014 a town called Carlos Casares, near Buenos Aires, is named after one of his ancestors \u2014 but his branch of the family went through hard times and ended up ranching sheep. When his father sold wool and the buyer\u2019s check took a month to clear, that income could be halved by inflation, forcing yet more household cutbacks. Whatever savings accumulated were quickly exchanged for dollars, which held their value better than pesos.In 2003, Casares and five friends bought a school bus and drove it on a three-week road trip from Buenos Aires, the capital, to Tierra del Fuego, at the southern end of South America. After the vehicle was stolen upon their return, the friends vowed to buy a second bus for another trip. In December 2011, one of them, Jorge Restelli, finally found a bus for 60,000 pesos, or $14,000, in the classified ads. The friends who lived in Argentina quickly paid their shares to purchase and fix it up, but Casares stalled, knowing how much it cost in time and fees to move money from the United States to Argentina. Then Restelli told him that Bitcoin might be just the answer.At the time, the virtual currency had a small cult following in the United States and was essentially unheard-of in Argentina, but Restelli had read about it on an American tech blog. The same day Casares heard about Bitcoin, he found someone online who agreed to meet him at a cafe in Palo Alto and sell him 2,700 or so Bitcoins for about $8,000 in cash. Casares sent Restelli the Bitcoins that evening.Casares was fascinated by the transaction. Here was money that anyone could buy online and that promised to hold its value better than the peso. (That promise would later be tested by extreme price swings.) It also seemed to offer access to the financial system for those who couldn\u2019t open bank accounts or secure credit cards. Even Casares, who created his first start-up in the country, had never held an Argentine bank account.He sent articles about Bitcoin to his bus-trip friends and explained how easy it was to move thousands of dollars in and out of Argentina. One friend went on to found the central Bitcoin advocacy group in Argentina and opened the Bitcoin Embassy in Buenos Aires. Casares began stockpiling Bitcoins, and when he visited Argentina during 2012, he posted offers to sell them on an Internet message board that was becoming a small, impromptu national marketplace for the virtual currency. He organized the first Bitcoin Meetup in Argentina in December 2012, though only a handful of people besides Restelli showed up at the whiskey bar where it was held.By then, Casares was proclaiming Bitcoin\u2019s promise to any Silicon Valley friend who would listen. He had come to believe that the advantages of its network would push the value of each Bitcoin to astronomical values, just as slivers of the airwave spectrum increased in worth as more communication companies sought to use it. In the meantime, each Bitcoin could serve as an easy, secure place to store money, comparable to gold.Many of Casares\u2019s friends in the United States were initially skeptical: What could Bitcoin do that their credit cards couldn\u2019t? But Casares explained how places like Argentina were different. His first big convert among his friends, and the one whose opinion in this area mattered the most, was David Marcus, who had recently become the president of PayPal. Marcus\u2019s light-bulb moment came in the fall of 2012, when the Argentine government ordered PayPal to bar direct payments between Argentines, part of the government\u2019s effort to slow the exchange of pesos into other currencies. As the policy went into effect, and Marcus watched the price of Bitcoin rise against the peso, he figured that Argentines were using Bitcoin to circumvent the government\u2019s restrictions. Marcus began buying Bitcoins himself and also pushed PayPal to start investigating the currency\u2019s use.In March 2013 Casares attended an exclusive technology conference near Tucson hosted by the investment bank Allen & Company. At dinner the first night, Casares won the attention of a table full of investors by describing his childhood experiences in Argentina and how Bitcoin equipped people to avoid similar situations. He demonstrated the capabilities of the Bitcoin network by sending $250,000 worth of the virtual currency to the phone of a table mate, who was then directed to pass the money along to the man next to him with no more than a few taps of his iPhone keypad. During the next two days of the conference, a steady stream of attendees who had seen or heard about the Sunday-evening conversation approached Casares, including Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn. On a hike Wednesday afternoon, Casares spent the entire time explaining the concept to Charlie Songhurst, Microsoft\u2019s head of corporate strategy.At the time, Casares was still running his mobile-wallet start-up and had no business stake connected to Bitcoin beyond his own holdings of the virtual currency, which had become substantial. He urged his friends to make their own purchases. On Monday, the first full day of the conference, the price of a Bitcoin jumped more than $2, to $36, and on Tuesday it rose more than $4, its sharpest rise in months, to more than $40. After everyone flew home from the conference, Songhurst wrote a paper and distributed it privately to some of the most powerful investors in Silicon Valley. \u201cWe foresee a real possibility that all currencies go digital, and competition eliminates all currencies from noneffective governments,\u201d it said, channeling Casares\u2019s arguments. \u201cThe power of friction-free transactions over the Internet will unleash the typical forces of consolidation and globalization, and we will end up with six digital currencies: US Dollar, euro, Yen, Pound, Renminbi and Bitcoin.\u201dThe buzz generated by the conference was not the only factor that pushed up the price of Bitcoin in March 2013. A financial crisis in Cyprus came to a head in the middle of the month; the closure of some bank accounts there led to conjecture that Russians were seeking refuge from the Cypriot banking system in Bitcoin. But Casares noticed that every time he helped another one of his wealthy friends start buying Bitcoins, prices rose, suggesting to him that they were responsible for much of the increase. Over the course of March, the price of a single Bitcoin nearly tripled, to around $100, and that surge generated the first widespread media coverage in the United States and Argentina (some of it, not coincidentally, from journalists cultivated by Casares). The crowd at the next Bitcoin Meetup in Argentina, hosted in April by one of Casares\u2019s friends, was about five times larger than the first one organized by Casares just a few months earlier.In-person Bitcoin trading, as Castiglione does it, happens in many other cities around the world. But if this were the only way to procure Bitcoins, the interest in trading them would not have exploded as it has in the United States and China, where exchanging money directly with strangers \u2014 without a trusted middleman, in other words \u2014 is not a routine part of business. In most places where Bitcoin has become popular, there have been ways to buy the virtual currency online. This, of course, requires cooperation with banks or other payment networks, which happened in the United States and Europe. The American company Coinbase, for instance, allows customers to transfer money from their bank to a Coinbase account and buy Bitcoins online.In Argentina, the banks refuse to work with Bitcoin companies like Coinbase, which isn\u2019t surprising, given the government\u2019s tight control over banks. This hasn\u2019t deterred Argentines, long accustomed to changing money outside official channels. For Castiglione and his company, DigiCoins, this means operating at the edge of the law, but he takes comfort from the fact that, at least for now, the Argentine government has bigger problems to deal with.Instead of bank tellers and branches, Bitcoin users in Argentina have come to rely on Castiglione and his competitors, some of whom are even willing to make house calls. This financial system developed much more slowly than it has in the United States, where American companies could take deposits from banks anywhere in the country. But as a result, Argentina\u2019s Bitcoin economy is much more resistant to bank policies, government regulations and full-service companies like Coinbase that undermine Bitcoin\u2019s decentralizing spirit.But he acknowledged that he and his children remained safe largely because they successfully kept their clients ignorant of their location by switching offices frequently: \u201cRight now, maybe God is on our side.\u201dOne of Castiglione\u2019s main competitors was another Bitcoin broker named Brenda Fern\u00e1ndez. Originally from the Buenos Aires suburbs and a college dropout, she previously smuggled electronics into the country and sold them on the local equivalent of eBay. She talked in loud bursts, punctuated with high-pitched laughs, and proudly made provocative statements about breaking the law and ignoring standard business practices when I met her at an event at the Bitcoin Embassy. \u201cI find a way to market myself as the crazy Bitcoin girl,\u201d she told me.In a more serious moment, Fern\u00e1ndez, who is 24, attributed both her attitude and her embrace of Bitcoin in part to the gender transition she made in her early 20s, after years of struggling with traditional gender categories. \u201cIt feels good, doing things that you are not supposed to, saying to the structures of power that they don\u2019t have power over you,\u201d she said.After the event at the embassy, Fern\u00e1ndez took a small black-and-yellow taxi to a hostel near the National Congress that wanted to exchange about $1,000 worth of Bitcoins. The Rock Hostel, with band-themed rooms, caters to a young clientele. A number of people were drinking beer in the common area when Fern\u00e1ndez showed up. The owner, a tattooed 29-year-old named Soledad Rodriguez Pons, had already transferred the Bitcoins to Fern\u00e1ndez online, so after a bit of flirting, Fern\u00e1ndez quickly handed over the cash; the transaction took place at the reception desk, where a sign offered customers a 10 percent discount if they paid by credit card. On top of the desk, under glass, were paper currencies from around the world.Rodriguez Pons, like many BitPagos clients, knew little about how Bitcoin worked and hadn\u2019t tried hard to figure it out. She once, somewhat accidentally, held onto her Bitcoins at a time when the price was rising, and ended up with a small windfall when she sold. She used the proceeds to build a rooftop bar and a music-rehearsal space. Beyond those extras, Rodriguez Pons credited the savings from using BitPagos with keeping her business alive in Argentina\u2019s very difficult business environment. The hardest part was often reaching Fern\u00e1ndez and Castiglione.\u201cI had to call Brenda four times today,\u201d she said with a smile.Transactions of this sort inevitably stir up fears of money laundering and terrorist financing. Banks currently serve as the front line in stopping illicit money transfers. If these regulated institutions are cut out of the business of moving money, the banks and government officials say, who will ensure that terrorists and organized crime are not using the network to move millions across borders? The fact that there is no single authority responsible for supervising the Bitcoin system has also made it easier for con men and thieves to defraud companies holding Bitcoins for customers \u2014 something that became clear last year when Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, declared bankruptcy after nearly half a billion dollars of clients\u2019 Bitcoins were fraudulently transferred out of their accounts. (A hacker generally needs only an owner\u2019s password to steal his or her Bitcoins.)Oddly enough, American regulators have actually been friendlier than banks toward the new technology. Even before the advent of Bitcoin, the Federal Reserve was looking into ways to update the relatively antiquated American payment networks, which often take two or three days to complete a simple money transfer. Several different branches of the Federal Reserve have released research papers over the last few years praising the improvements that Bitcoin might spur, even if Bitcoin itself isn\u2019t adopted by the mainstream as a virtual currency. In 2013, when he was chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke wrote a letter to a Senate committee studying Bitcoin in which he praised its \u201clong-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.\u201dBanks are aware that this is an area in which they will likely have to adapt or lose business, perhaps even be made irrelevant. While most of the major banks have criticized Bitcoin and refused to work with virtual-currency companies, many of them are nonetheless spending a lot of time and energy behind the scenes studying the technology. JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest bank, decided in early 2014 not to conduct business with Bitcoin companies. But it did form its own Bitcoin Working Group, which consists of about two dozen executives throughout the bank who have been meeting fortnightly or monthly to discuss how the technology could change their business.Banks are captivated, in particular, by the ledger on which all Bitcoins and Bitcoin transactions are recorded: what is known as the blockchain. Unlike traditional financial ledgers, kept by a central institution, the Bitcoin ledger is updated and maintained by everyone on the network, not unlike how Wikipedia is written and monitored by its users. One virtue of this approach is that the network has no central point subject to failure, like Visa and the New York Stock Exchange in their financial realms. It also means there is no middleman collecting fees with each transaction. And because the bookkeeping is publicly accessible, records can\u2019t be manipulated in secret or after the fact.JPMorgan belongs to an association of big banks, the Clearing House, that has been confidentially putting together a \u201cproof of concept\u201d for a decentralized ledger, or blockchain, that would run on the computers of all the participating banks. According to people involved, this network, which is still in the conceptual phase, could allow instant transfers between accounts at all the member banks and eliminate the current risks involved in having billions of dollars in limbo for days at a time. For many bankers, the most valuable potential use of the blockchain is not small payments but very large ones, which account for the vast majority of the money moving around the world each day. The banks, though, are moving slowly, even as several start-ups are trying to use the Bitcoin blockchain to do the same thing on a global basis, cutting out the banks altogether.One of the most recent entrants into this area is a start-up led by a former top executive from JPMorgan. The Federal Reserve has had its own people looking at how to utilize the blockchain technology and potentially even Bitcoin itself. If someone can find a way to minimize the volatility of Bitcoin prices \u2014 as many are trying to do \u2014 it would be much easier for people to keep their savings in Bitcoin instead of a bank account.\u201cIn the long run, Bitcoin will be very disruptive to the developed world,\u201d Dan Morehead, a former Goldman Sachs executive who now runs a hedge fund focused on Bitcoin, told me. Things are happening sooner in Argentina, he said, because its financial system creates hassles for the people there. But, he added, \u201cArgentina is just a more extreme example of the situation in every country.\u201dCastiglione was so busy running around the city, trying to keep up with the competition, that he was hard to pin down. When we finally met near the Bitcoin Embassy, late at night, he was with a tough-looking friend who was joining DigiCoins to help with the physical deliveries of cash, bringing with him a motorcycle and experience handling large amounts of money. The men had just come back from a trip to a town three hours west of Buenos Aires, where they had sold $20,000 worth of Bitcoins. They had been forced to make the trip at the last minute because another big sale had fallen through, and they did not otherwise have enough dollars to conduct business for the next few days. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t gotten that cash, I was done,\u201d Castiglione told me, before heading out for a last trade just before midnight.Earlier that day, as I sat with Fern\u00e1ndez in a Subway sandwich shop, which was her temporary office, chosen for its free Wi-Fi, she did not try to hide her difficulty in adapting to the more competitive environment with her \u201ccrazy Bitcoin girl\u201d routine, which was making it hard to keep big customers. She did have one business in the United States that sent her about $5,000 worth of Bitcoins each month and had her exchange the money and deposit the pesos into the company\u2019s Argentine bank account, in order to make payroll. But a lot of her customers were young people who wanted to buy a few hundred pesos worth of a Bitcoin so that they could pay online for a Netflix subscription or a video game. \u201cThe market moved in another direction,\u201d she said, \u201cand I didn\u2019t move in that direction.\u201dShe had come to have serious doubts about whether Bitcoin would end up being any better than the old system if it was dominated by the ruling class, which would be immune to any popular backlash, thanks to the lack of a central Bitcoin authority. \u201cThe key turning point is when the rich elite see it as a way to safeguard their wealth,\u201d she said.Among the people Fern\u00e1ndez and Castiglione were both contending with was Wences Casares. He decided in late 2013 that he cared too much about Bitcoin to leave its development to others. He quickly sold his digital-wallet start-up and started his own Bitcoin-centric company with one of the friends from the bus trip, Federico Murrone, an Argentine who was the head programmer on Casares\u2019s past start-ups. Within two months of selling their old company, Casares and Murrone had secured $40 million in funding from investors like Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder.The office that Casares\u2019s new company, Xapo (pronounced \u201czappo\u201d), opened in Buenos Aires has none of the scrappiness of other virtual-currency players in the country. It occupies a full floor of a building in a fashionable part of the city; amenities included table tennis, glass walls and large, wall-mounted televisions. Xapo initially concentrated on ultrasecure storage for customers who own lots of Bitcoins \u2014 it holds the Bitcoins of many of the wealthy tech moguls who followed Casares\u2019s advice. But Casares has ambitions to turn the company into a one-stop financial provider for the virtual-currency industry. The global aspirations were evident from the Hindi-language site that I saw his staff creating.Casares spent months establishing a partnership with Taringa, the most popular Argentine social network. This month, millions of Taringa members in Argentina and the rest of Latin America automatically had a Xapo Bitcoin wallet opened for them. Users will be able to put Bitcoins or fractions of Bitcoins in their wallets by depositing cash at local drugstores, in the same way they pay utility bills. From those accounts, Argentines can pay for things online without a credit card or make online micropayments of 5 or 10 cents for video games and other digital goods (credit cards usually charge a minimum of 25 or 30 cents for each purchase).When I asked Castiglione what he thought about a global venture like Xapo, he evinced a workingman\u2019s skepticism. \u201cWe might not be as big as Wences, but the real thing happens here,\u201d Castiglione said, as we sat in his temporary office between client visits. \u201cPeople get the cash to spend.\u201dWhether his endeavors would help Bitcoin live up to its grand promise \u2014 supplanting Wall Street and central banks \u2014 was something Castiglione would consider only in the most pragmatic terms.\u201cIf people don\u2019t use it, it will go to trash, like anything that isn\u2019t used in this world,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf people use it, then it has a future.\u201dThis article was adapted from \u201cDigital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money,\u201d to be published in May by Harper, a division of HarperCollins.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Publication of New Internet Rules to Prompt Cheers and Challenges", "Date": "2015-04-05", "News": "For those who have spent more than a decade fighting for stricter regulation of the Internet, the official publication of the rules in the Federal Register, expected as early as Monday, will give reality to their latest victory. For those opposed, it is likely to touch off a flurry of lawsuits.There was often disagreement in that village, though, about what to call the cause.Ms. Corbett said advocates of stricter regulations for\u00c2\u00a0Internet providers had spent years seeking to make the lofty, abstract principles of the movement accessible to the general public. Some tried to oust \u201cnet neutrality\u201d from the vernacular. \u201cWe tried to rebrand it and call it the \u2018open Internet,\u2019 \u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Others\u00c2\u00a0put forth\u00c2\u00a0options like \u201csave the Internet\u201d and \u201cnet freedom.\u201d\u201cBut net neutrality, God bless Tim Wu, it stuck,\u201d Ms. Corbett said.Mr. Wu shrugged off the \u201cdozen or so\u201d efforts to replace the name he popularized,\u00c2\u00a0noting that his coinage had been accidental, in spite of his\u00c2\u00a0early work in marketing. \u201cI think it stuck because of the two N\u2019s in a row,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cPeople love alliteration.\u201dIn the\u00c2\u00a0first\u00c2\u00a0draft of the\u00c2\u00a0law review article in which he introduced the term, he called it Internetwork neutrality, which was chopped down twice \u00e2\u0080\u0094to network neutrality, then to net neutrality. \u201cIt sort of sounds like it\u2019s something real as opposed to a slogan,\u201d he said.Still, supporters of the principles know that the name will be\u00c2\u00a0irrelevant to the legal challenges\u00c2\u00a0that are widely expected. For opponents of the regulation, publication of the rules will start another 60-day countdown: the period\u00c2\u00a0of time in which lawsuits can be filed.The first 10 days after the rules are published in the Federal Register will be particularly significant, said Harold Feld, senior vice president of Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group that focuses on Internet policy. All legal complaints\u00c2\u00a0filed in that time will be considered together, and a lottery will determine which federal court will hear\u00c2\u00a0that unified case. Some opponents of the rules are expected to file lawsuits in conservative jurisdictions, in hopes that a court more likely to rule against the F.C.C. will be assigned the case.Many challengers are expected to take issue with the agency\u2019s\u00c2\u00a0reclassifying Internet service providers as telecommunications rather than information services, subjecting them to utility-style regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. Many opponents have said they object, not to the\u00c2\u00a0principles of net neutrality, but to the Title II classification.In a speech at Texas A&M University last fall, the president of Alamo Broadband, Joe Portman, criticized the impending regulations. \u201cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much a terrible idea born of good intentions,\u201d he said, arguing that it addressed hypothetical harms. \u201cIf it\u00c2\u00a0ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t broke, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fix it.\u201dStill, champions of the rules\u00c2\u00a0are\u00c2\u00a0undeterred by challenges to come.\u00c2\u00a0Ms. Corbett said the movement\u2019s moment in the spotlight has invigorated many veterans\u00c2\u00a0of the cause.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019ve gotten\u00c2\u00a0validation that people are paying attention, and it matters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said,\u00c2\u00a0noting that there had been numerous\u00c2\u00a0victories and defeats in the last 15 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve won a battle, but\u00c2\u00a0it would be foolish to think it was the whole war.\u201dFollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Trans-Pacific Partnership Matters", "Date": "2015-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsBut the congressional outlook for this approach \u2014 called Trade Promotion Authority, or fast-track negotiating authority, because it does not allow amendments or filibustering \u2014 has dimmed. Without it, the agreement would collapse, the victim of endless amendments. The coming vote, therefore, is the equivalent to a vote on the TPP itself. Should it die, the adverse impact on American national security would be great. The trade debate coincides with growing challenges to America\u2019s allies. In the Western Hemisphere, the governments of Canada and Chile, which are parties to the trade negotiations, believe the accord (despite domestic critics) will stimulate growth. In Asia and the Pacific, parties to the deal \u2014 not only our allies Japan and Australia, but also Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia \u2014 see the trade accord as a way of counterbalancing China\u2019s economic might. This is why trade is central to our foreign policy; without this deal, the so-called pivot to Asia will be hollow. Three myths are undermining support for the TPP in the United States. The first is that recent trade agreements have hurt jobs and wages and widened income inequality. This argument fails to differentiate between the impacts of increased global trade and those of trade agreements. The M.I.T. economist David H. Autor and colleagues concluded that from 1990 to 2007, Chinese imports accounted for 21 percent of the decline in American manufacturing employment. But the United States does not have a bilateral trade deal with China. These jobs were lost to expanding trade \u2014 not to a trade agreement. Yes, income inequality has widened to economically and socially harmful levels. But it is globalization, technology and flawed educational and tax systems that are driving this trend, not trade pacts. A second myth is that the TPP would degrade labor and environmental standards and raise drug costs. But the accord includes protections directly drawn from the International Labor Organization, with strong enforcement mechanisms. As for the environment, there is nothing new in the TPP that would affect existing dispute-resolution mechanisms. Finally, it is far from certain that new protections for drug companies would lead to higher drug costs. A third myth is that the TPP is flawed because it won\u2019t prevent countries from competing unfairly by devaluing their currencies to stimulate exports. This criticism is shortsighted. When the Federal Reserve, having lowered its key interest rate to nearly zero, began extensive bond-buying in 2009, the trading value of the dollar fell against most other currencies. There was severe criticism from Europe and Asia that we were unfairly depreciating the dollar to improve our trade position. Of course, the Fed\u2019s sole goal was to revive spending and investment here. Now, both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have initiated their own versions of extreme monetary easing. And, in response, the trading value of the dollar has risen against the euro and the yen. But the eurozone and Japan aren\u2019t trying to start a trade war any more than we were. We should hope their monetary policies succeed in spurring growth, because then their demand for American exports will rise. What\u2019s more, China, widely seen as the main culprit in currency manipulation, isn\u2019t part of the TPP. The International Monetary Fund should remain the venue for challenging what are judged to be illegitimate government interventions to drive down their currencies.The benefits of the TPP are many. It would further open the 12-nation region to trade in services and agriculture, two sectors in which the United States historically runs large trade surpluses. Better protection of American intellectual property will help industries, from high-tech manufacturing to Hollywood, in which Asian piracy has been rampant.Free trade leads to greater overall prosperity. The gains from free trade need to be widely shared, but defeating the TPP would not solve America\u2019s problems with inequality. Instead, it would further rattle our allies. \u201cFurther\u201d is the key word here, as there already are rising doubts about American reliability \u2014 the result of the debt-ceiling crises, government shutdowns, the failure to follow through on threats in Syria and, most recently, the letter addressed to Iran from 47 senators. If the TPP fails, countries that, rightly or wrongly, see Washington as ineffective will pay America less heed. It\u2019s reasonable to debate the merits of this major trade agreement. But the critics have exaggerated and distorted the economic costs of the accord, while all but ignoring its benefits \u2014 and the strategic costs of a rejection. The real choice is between supporting a trade accord that would help most Americans and serve the country\u2019s strategic aims, and defeating it, which would leave the country poorer and the world less stable.

{"Headline": "Review: Anne Hathaway as a Fighter Pilot in \u2018Grounded\u2019 at the Public Theater", "Date": "2015-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s some unusual tabloid fodder: Anne Hathaway has joined the Air Force!The intriguing irony upon which the play rests is that Ms. Hathaway\u2019s character, who remains unnamed, doesn\u2019t begin to lose her steady grip on the righteousness of her work until she has been plucked from the sky, \u201cthe blue\u201d as she calls it, in awe-struck, even worshipful tones. Early in the play, the pilot exudes a brash but not off-putting arrogance. Speaking of the pilot suit she\u2019s earned, she says: \u201cI never wanted to take it off. ... This was who I was now, who I\u2019d become through sweat and brains and guts. This is me.\u201dShe takes pride in just being one of the guys, and Ms. Hathaway, with her hair cropped short, a down-home twang in her voice and a masculine swagger in her stride, does indeed seem to be the kind of gal who would much rather be knocking back beers with her fellow pilots than, say, doing her nails. Home on leave in Wyoming, she\u2019s doing just that (the beer, not the nails) when she meets Eric, the rare man who isn\u2019t put off by her choice of career.\u201cMost guys don\u2019t like what I do,\u201d she says bluntly, but with a mischievous sense of pleasure. \u201cFeel they\u2019re less of a guy around me. I take the guy spot, and they don\u2019t know where they belong.\u201dBut for Eric, who works in the family hardware store, a woman in macho pilot\u2019s gear is a turn-on. (She agrees to have sex with the suit on, but only once.) And although her life has been bound up in her career \u2014 in that ecstatic communion with the sky \u2014 soon she finds herself unexpectedly attached. \u201cFirst time I\u2019m sad leave is over,\u201d she notes. A few weeks later the real (metaphoric) bomb drops: She\u2019s pregnant, and as a result, grounded. Working a desk job. \u201cThe pilot\u2019s nightmare,\u201d she says bitterly.As Ms. Hathaway circles the small stage of the Anspacher Theater, the only real prop on hand is a silver chair that descends (with rather unnecessary spectacle, actually) from the skies. It\u2019s now from the safe, anonymous atmosphere of an armchair in a military facility in Las Vegas that this pilot will be \u201cflying\u201d \u2014 without leaving the ground, or getting even a glimpse of blue. She\u2019ll be controlling the drones that are increasingly (and controversially) being used by the United States to wage war in the Middle East.Our heroine doesn\u2019t exactly leap for joy when she\u2019s enlisted in what she derisively calls the \u201cchair force.\u201d But with a new baby and a new husband, she returns to duty, this time tracking bad guys in Afghanistan, for 12 hours a day, seven days a week. And there are compensations: \u201cI will see my daughter grow up,\u201d she says. \u201cI will kiss my husband good night every night. No tracer fire. ...The threat of death has been removed.\u201dThose words come to take on a dark significance as the pilot becomes immersed in her new job. For while the threat of danger to herself has certainly evaporated, the responsibility of making life and death choices while waging war from an emotional distance begins to unsettle and unnerve her. \u201cGrounded\u201d implicitly suggests that engaging in combat from a place of relative safety may take just as harsh a psychological toll as traditional deployment.For the first time we begin to hear hints of doubt and anxiety in Ms. Hathaway\u2019s hitherto confident voice. Suddenly, hands that used to firmly grip the controls of a plane become sweaty on the joystick. With the high-definition video giving a precise picture of the havoc being wrought below, she can see the raw reality of the bomb blasts, as body parts fly up amid the wreckage. She\u2019s also forced to watch American forces as they die, when the drones are required to linger over battle sites, \u201cas one by one their bodies slowly turn the same gray as the sand.\u201dSome baggy or repetitive passages notwithstanding, Mr. Brant\u2019s writing largely remains taut, terse and concentrated on exposing the fissures that open in the heroine\u2019s confidence and sense of honor. Ms. Taymor and Ms. Hathaway allow the words to remain at the forefront of \u201cGrounded,\u201d even as we are also treated to impressive video displays that show us what the pilot sees as she stares into \u201cthe gray\u201d of the desert for hours every day. (Peter Nigrini\u2019s projections play an integral role.) A tilted black glass wall at the back of the stage reflects the action, adding a ghostly dimension to the production that suggests the underside of what the pilot is experiencing: the gradual onset of something akin to post-traumatic stress disorder stealing upon her from behind.Ms. Hathaway expertly delineates the gradual disintegration of her character\u2019s equilibrium. In a particularly sharp passage, the pilot takes her daughter to the mall and finds herself unusually disturbed by the \u201clittle black circle in the corner of the wall,\u201d a surveillance camera that no longer seems a harmless device to her. \u201cThere\u2019s always a camera, right? J. C. Penney or Afghanistan. Everything is witnessed.\u201dAnd you get a chill hearing those words spoken by Ms. Hathaway in a voice both harsh and deadened, the eager enthusiasm in her character\u2019s eyes having been extinguished by all those days of staring into the gray anonymity of the deserts, where men, women and even children can die at the push of a button thousands of miles away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Libya Crumbles, Calls Grow for Feuding Factions to Meet Halfway", "Date": "2015-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMISURATA, Libya \u2014 Libyans have puzzled for four years over what might arrest their country\u2019s disintegration.But now a growing number of politicians on both sides of the conflict say that the dual threats from colonies of the Islamic State and a looming collapse of the economy may finally jolt Libya out of that spiral. In a series of interviews in five Libyan cities on both sides of the fight, political leaders were for the first time trying in earnest to reverse that trend, calling for unconditional negotiations and reciprocal concessions.\u201cIt is the realization that Libya is in danger,\u201d said Fathi Bashaagha, a businessman who leads the pro-unity faction now ascendant in the pivotal city of Misurata, whose powerful militias have been fighting in several places around the country. \u201cNobody can win. We have only one way we can survive, and that is a unity government.\u201dAbubakr Buera, an influential lawmaker who last year led the Parliament to move to the side opposing Misurata, said he now agreed, \u201cto save the misery of the people.\u201dAgainst doves warning of an imminent catastrophe, hawks continue to minimize the threats, insisting that a military triumph is the only lasting solution.\u201cIt will take some time, but it is possible to win the war, and the winner is going to be the winner,\u201d asserted Abdulrahman Swehli, previously the most influential political figure in Misurata and still the leader of a hawkish camp opposed to Mr. Bashaagha.The reports about the growth of the Islamic State in Libya are \u201cpropaganda,\u201d Mr. Swehli said, and the economic situation is \u201cbad but not dire.\u201d He accused the United Nations diplomat leading the unity talks of \u201cmaking things worse\u201d by trying to isolate those like himself who still saw the domestic conflict as an existential battle.Still, the chiefs of Misurata\u2019s civilian and military councils both said that the majority of the city was backing Mr. Bashaagha and the unity talks, because of fatigue with the battle and a sense of the growing dangers.\u201cWe are not as united as we once were,\u201d Mr. Swehli conceded. \u201cSome people are getting tired.\u201dEach of the two coalitions now has its own rival provisional government, each riven with internal divisions.The side that is recognized internationally, centered in the eastern cities of Tobruk and Bayda, is dominated and defined by Gen. Khalifa Hifter, 72, who once fought for Colonel Qaddafi but later broke with him to join the exiled opposition. General Hifter last year announced his own attempt at a military takeover, promising to purge Libya of both moderate and extremist Islamists.Libyans fearful of the extremists have embraced him as a hero, while others have denounced him as a second Qaddafi. The western city of Zintan has allied with him mainly in shared opposition to the expanding influence of the coastal city of Misurata.The other coalition, centered in Misurata, controls the capital, Tripoli. It includes both moderate and extremist Islamists as well as Berber tribes and much of the former exiled opposition to Colonel Qaddafi \u2014 all united mainly by a fear of General Hifter.Both factions have continued to draw on the same central bank to meet increasingly inflated payrolls, often for no-show jobs or inflated militia budgets. Public payroll costs tripled to $24 billion in 2014 from $8 billion in the year before the uprising of 2011, said Musbah Alkari, manager of the reserves department at the Central Bank of Libya, while oil revenue plunged.Libya could run a deficit of more than $40 billion in 2015, quickly burning through its foreign reserves of about $90 billion, according to Central Bank figures. The currency may collapse in less than two years, Mr. Alkari said, but many Libyan politicians still believe that Libya is rich and that \u201cwe can\u2019t go broke.\u201dThe Tobruk-Bayda government\u2019s leaders say their current war is against extremism, but a growing number of lawmakers in its Parliament now argue that a unity government is the only way to defeat it. \u201cI hope we can all stand up and expel the terrorists together,\u201d said Muad Rafa Mosod, 30, a lawmaker from the south.Elected last year and now based in Tobruk, the Parliament confers legitimacy on the Tobruk-Bayda government and it has named General Hifter its top military commander.But it does not disclose its attendance or vote counts. In part because of a boycott by members opposed to General Hifter, fewer than 110 members in the 200-seat chamber usually attended last year, and attendance has since fallen below 90.In the first vote last year on the unity talks, more than 50 voted against and fewer than 50 voted in favor, several lawmakers said. But the most recent vote had flipped to 65 in favor and 12 against, according to Mr. Buera, the first speaker and an influential member.In Tripoli, even the chief of staff overseeing his faction\u2019s war effort said that neither side could win on the battlefield. Without a unity government, said the chief, Jedalla al-Obeida, \u201cwe will have city-states and a Somalia scenario.\u201dBut like the Misuratan hawks, the military leaders in Tobruk and Bayda show no sign of relenting. In an interview, Saqr al-Jarushi, chief of General Hifter\u2019s small air force, accused the Misuratans of plotting to bring Jews to Libya and praised Colonel Qaddafi for his crackdowns on Islamists. \u201cIt was better that he killed them,\u201d Mr. Jarushi said, \u201cbecause otherwise they would be heads of militias just as they are now. This is what Qaddafi was afraid of.\u201dBut how to deal with genuine extremists also remains an unanswered question for the Misurata coalition. The coalition includes Ansar al-Shariah of Benghazi, the extremist group linked to the attack that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in 2012 and widely blamed for a campaign of bombings and assassinations against security and other perceived foes.Misurata-Tripoli leaders tend to dodge questions about their Ansar al-Shariah allies. Jamal Naji Zubia, head of the Tripoli foreign media office, recently suggested that the Benghazi Islamist fighters should address the problem by better explaining themselves through the news media. \u201cI told them, \u2018You say you are mujahedeen and you are not afraid of death, so why are you afraid to show your faces?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Zubia said.Mohamed Dayri, foreign minister of the Tobruk-Bayda government, said he told the United Nations envoys that talks were \u201cnecessary but not sufficient\u201d to defeat the extremists. \u201cA political track, yes, but what about a military track?\u201d he said.On the other side, even the most conciliatory leaders of the Misurata-Tripoli faction are dead set against any role for General Hifter.\u201cHe just wants to be on top of the throne,\u201d Mr. Bashaagha said. \u201cWe had that experience for 40 years, under Qaddafi.\u201dThen any unity government would face the same challenge that undermined its predecessors: how to exert civilian control over the feuding militias.\u201cAt some point, they are going to realize that you can point as many guns as you want and you still can\u2019t pay salaries,\u201d said Motasim Elalem, 39, a banker in Tripoli. \u201cI keep waiting for Libya to hit rock bottom,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I think we are going to have to burn it down first.\u201dSuliman Ali Zway contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Mac Test Shows Job Market Is Not Working to Distribute Wealth", "Date": "2015-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneSome 15 years ago, searching for a consistent way to compare wages of equivalent workers across the world, Orley Ashenfelter, an economics professor at Princeton University, came upon McDonald\u2019s.The uniform, highly scripted production methods used throughout the McDonald\u2019s fast-food empire allowed Professor Ashenfelter to compare workers in far-flung countries doing virtually the same thing. The company also offered a natural index to measure the purchasing power of its wages around the world: the price of a Big Mac.Even before the financial crisis struck, the McWages of McDonald\u2019s workers in the United States, many Western European countries, Japan and Canada went nowhere between 2000 and 2007, a period of steady, though unspectacular, economic growth in most of the developed world. In the United States, real McWages actually declined. \u201cIt\u2019s puzzling that we can get away with paying so little for what are really terrible jobs,\u201d Professor Ashenfelter told me.Faced with a tightening labor market and besieged by a vocal, combative movement demanding higher wages for America\u2019s worst-paid employees, McDonald\u2019s, Walmart and other large employers of cheap labor have offered modest raises to millions of workers scraping the bottom of the job market.But what is often overlooked in the hypercharged debate about corporate morality is how a similar dynamic is taking hold around the industrialized world.What this suggests is that the job market \u2014 that most critical institution of capitalist societies, the principal vehicle to distribute the nation\u2019s wealth among its people \u2014 is not working properly. This raises a fundamental question: If the job market cannot keep hardworking people out of poverty and spread prosperity more broadly, how will it be done? Is public assistance our future?Lane Kenworthy, a professor of sociology at the University of California, San Diego, has disentangled the evolution of household incomes over the last three or four decades. The wages from work, he found, are playing a diminishing role for a growing swath of the labor force.In some ways, Mitt Romney, with his self-damaging remarks to wealthy contributors during the 2012 presidential campaign that 47 percent of Americans \u201care dependent upon government,\u201d was right.Between 1979 and 2007, almost one third of the income gains of American households in the bottom half of the income ladder came from government transfers.But Mr. Romney\u2019s efforts to blame the victims of an inadequate job market for turning to government help missed the larger point: A combination of sluggish employment and stagnant wages has forced more families to rely on the public purse in many developed nations.\u00a0In Canada, for example, labor market earnings for the bottom fourth of the income ladder grew by roughly $25 a year between 1979 and 2007. Government transfers increased by $78. For Canadian households one rung higher \u2014 between the 25th and the 50th percent of the earnings distribution \u2014 there were no increases in labor market compensation. All gains came from the government.In Germany \u2014 often portrayed as the gold standard of the postindustrial labor market \u2014 the entire bottom half of households experienced shrinking earnings from work. They only got ahead because of rising government benefits.After 40 years of stagnant earnings from the middle on down, Professor Kenworthy said, it\u2019s hard to sustain the argument that things will be all right in the end. \u201cThat\u2019s a very long time to be just an aberration,\u201d he told me.Perhaps it is simply that the demand for skill in the modern job market has grown faster than its supply. The United States, notably, hasn\u2019t increased educational attainment at the rate the labor market requires. And the economy simply doesn\u2019t need as many less-educated workers as it once did.\u201cWe have spent the last three decades not raising education levels at the rate the labor market demands,\u201d said David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cSo we have a growing surplus of less-educated workers.\u201dBut maybe something else is going on. Lawrence Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard, noted how some 40 years ago, the compensation of American workers became decoupled from productivity growth, which continued to advance even as wages stagnated. \u201cWe haven\u2019t kept up improving skills as we did before,\u201d Professor Katz said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not all about that.\u201dIn that case, argues Prof. Richard B. Freeman, a labor economist from Harvard, we need entirely new mechanisms to distribute income across the economy.\u201cThe best solution is that these people get their income through some citizen\u2019s ownership of the capital stock so that they are like rich people with much nonlabor income,\u201d he said. That \u201cwill take some policies to make the most highly unequal part of income \u2014 ownership of capital \u2014 more equal.\u201dHas capitalism reached such an inflection point? Professor Autor says no \u2014 at least not yet. \u201cThe amount of concern is out of proportion with the evidence of what is actually happening,\u201d he said. People look at their iPhones and \u201cextrapolate from that to mass unemployment.\u201dThe argument that robots are about to wipe out millions of good jobs is problematic at best. If that were true, our productivity should be rising at a far faster pace.Still, even if the prescription of more education remains sound, it might not hold forever. And while more education might be necessary, it seems insufficient.Professor Katz argues that more must be done to ensure work pays \u2014 including achieving higher minimum wages. He suggests that government subsidize complements of work, like day care. Infrastructure investment and public employment also could help. He is skeptical that profit-sharing firm by firm is part of the solution.\u201cIt generates inequality,\u201d he argued. \u201cNot everybody can work at Apple.\u201dBut Professor Freeman\u2019s idea of societywide profit-sharing, to give all workers some share of the returns to capital that now only benefit the rich, should not be lightly discarded. Something is not working right for a majority of Americans. Maybe it\u2019s time to try something different.Email: eporter@nytimes.com Twitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Leaving Venezuela\u2019s Fields of Dreams", "Date": "2015-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn cruelly polarized Venezuela, mired in a disastrous economy and swept by criminal violence, baseball culture has been a haven of joyful civility, togetherness and tolerance. Now even that bridge over the sectarian abyss seems to be collapsing.Only weeks ago, the Seattle Mariners announced that they were moving their summer league baseball academy to the Dominican Republic. Venezuela\u2019s four remaining academies \u2014 those of the Philadelphia Phillies, the Detroit Tigers, the Tampa Bay Rays and the Chicago Cubs \u2014 are expected to follow suit early next year. For Venezuelan baseball fans, this is a national disaster. A baseball game in Venezuela is not a relaxing outing at the park. It is a raucous ritual where all social classes and political persuasions mix in one of the few neutral grounds left in the country. Fernando P\u00e9rez, a former player with the Tampa Bay Rays who holds a degree in American studies from Columbia University in New York, wrote an essay for Poetry magazine about his experience in the Venezuelan league:\u201cI write from Caracas, the murder capital of the world, where I\u2019ve been employed by the Leones\u201d \u2014 the city\u2019s home club \u2014 \u201cto score runs and prevent balls from falling in the outfield. At the ankles of the \u00c1vila Mount, amongst a patch of dusky high-rises, the downtown grounds of el Estadio Universitario\u201d \u2014 Caracas\u2019s largest ballpark \u2014 \u201cpacked beyond capacity are ripe for a full-bodied poem. A mere pitching change is an occasion \u2018para rumbiar\u201d\u2019 \u2014 to celebrate. \u201cThe game isn\u2019t paced necessarily by innings or score. It\u2019s marked by the pulsating bass drums of the samba band that trail bright, scantily clad, head-dressed goddesses strutting about the mezzanine.\u201dThe Venezuelan Summer League, an all-rookie circuit, was established in 1997 by several American major league teams seeking to develop the local talent pool. By 2002, 21 academies were functioning and producing impressive results: In 1994, only 19 Venezuelans played with a major-league baseball team. In 2010, 90 Venezuelans regularly appeared in big-league games. Today, 120 years after the first game was staged in a Caracas railway yard, Venezuelans take pride in their 102 countrymen who were in spring training camps preparing for the new season. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, long before he became the comandante, worked as hard as any poor Venezuelan boy to escape poverty by becoming a big-league pitcher. Though he often enlivened his hourslong harangues with baseball jargon, his Bolivarian revolution contemplated \u2014 for a short while \u2014 a plan to abolish professional baseball, as Fidel Castro (another failed baseball player) did in Cuba in 1960. The deafening uproar from militant chavista grass-roots groups put an end to that idea.In 2008, 10 years into the Ch\u00e1vez era and against a backdrop of insecurity and bewildering currency controls, the Houston Astros, who came to the country in 1989, shut down their facilities and moved to the Dominican Republic. The remaining organizations gradually began to cut back on the academies. The growing costs of security to prevent armed robberies were among the many concerns teams had. But these defections deprive underprivileged and talented Venezuelan youngsters of opportunities. Though the odds against making the big leagues are high, the chance of reward is great. (The average major league salary is $3.2 million; the league minimum is $480,000.) The public safety situation has deteriorated precipitously; Venezuela had the second-highest homicide rate in the world last year. Many high-earning Venezuelan stars, such as the Washington Nationals catcher Wilson Ramos, who was abducted in 2011 and narrowly escaped death during an air rescue operation, have moved to the United States.In February, with mounting tensions between Caracas and Washington, the Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, ordered most American diplomats to be expelled. United States citizens traveling to Venezuela will now need visas, raising concerns among local fans that this might keep United States players away from our winter league, a top-notch training ground for professionals for more than 70 years. Without \u201clos importados\u201d (the imported ones), as American professional ball players are affectionately called, our winter league would lose a great deal of its luster. The story of baseball in Venezuela has nothing to do with the many United States military interventions in the region. In the early 1890s, sons of the Venezuelan elite, returning from studies abroad, introduced the game in what then was a poor country ravaged by tropical fevers, endless civil wars and ruthless tyrants. Cuban political \u00e9migr\u00e9s then living in Caracas also played an important role in the development of Venezuelan baseball.Nemesio Guill\u00f3, a well-to-do Cuban sent by his parents to Alabama in 1858 to study at Springhill College, is credited with bringing the first bat and baseball to Cuba in 1864, while the American Civil War raged and Cubans were still subjects of the Spanish king. Spanish colonial authorities soon outlawed the game, deeming it subversive, but independent young Cubans favored baseball over bullfights \u2014 and the Spanish monarchy.Similarly, Venezuelans of all social classes found in baseball a compelling example of modernity, egalitarianism and freedom. As is true in many Caribbean countries, baseball is as much a part of Venezuelan popular culture as it is an all-American sport. One can only wonder what the hemispheric political landscape would now be if, instead of becoming a delirious autocrat who squandered his country\u2019s vast oil wealth, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez had fulfilled his teenage big-league dream.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran and the Obama Doctrine", "Date": "2015-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Obama invited me to the Oval Office Saturday afternoon to lay out exactly how he was trying to balance these risks and opportunities in the framework accord reached with Iran last week in Switzerland. What struck me most was what I\u2019d call an \u201cObama doctrine\u201d embedded in the president\u2019s remarks. It emerged when I asked if there was a common denominator to his decisions to break free from longstanding United States policies isolating Burma, Cuba and now Iran. Obama said his view was that \u201cengagement,\u201d combined with meeting core strategic needs, could serve American interests vis-\u00e0-vis these three countries far better than endless sanctions and isolation. He added that America, with its overwhelming power, needs to have the self-confidence to take some calculated risks to open important new possibilities \u2014 like trying to forge a diplomatic deal with Iran that, while permitting it to keep some of its nuclear infrastructure, forestalls its ability to build a nuclear bomb for at least a decade, if not longer.\u201cWe are powerful enough to be able to test these propositions without putting ourselves at risk. And that\u2019s the thing ... people don\u2019t seem to understand,\u201d the president said. \u201cYou take a country like Cuba. For us to test the possibility that engagement leads to a better outcome for the Cuban people, there aren\u2019t that many risks for us. It\u2019s a tiny little country. It\u2019s not one that threatens our core security interests, and so [there\u2019s no reason not] to test the proposition. And if it turns out that it doesn\u2019t lead to better outcomes, we can adjust our policies. The same is true with respect to Iran, a larger country, a dangerous country, one that has engaged in activities that resulted in the death of U.S. citizens, but the truth of the matter is: Iran\u2019s defense budget is $30 billion. Our defense budget is closer to $600 billion. Iran understands that they cannot fight us. ... You asked about an Obama doctrine. The doctrine is: We will engage, but we preserve all our capabilities.\u201dThe notion that Iran is undeterrable \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s simply not the case,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd so for us to say, \u2018Let\u2019s try\u2019 \u2014 understanding that we\u2019re preserving all our options, that we\u2019re not na\u00efve \u2014 but if in fact we can resolve these issues diplomatically, we are more likely to be safe, more likely to be secure, in a better position to protect our allies, and who knows? Iran may change. If it doesn\u2019t, our deterrence capabilities, our military superiority stays in place. ... We\u2019re not relinquishing our capacity to defend ourselves or our allies. In that situation, why wouldn\u2019t we test it?\u201dObviously, Israel is in a different situation, he added. \u201cNow, what you might hear from Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu, which I respect, is the notion, \u2018Look, Israel is more vulnerable. We don\u2019t have the luxury of testing these propositions the way you do,\u2019 and I completely understand that. And further, I completely understand Israel\u2019s belief that given the tragic history of the Jewish people, they can\u2019t be dependent solely on us for their own security. But what I would say to them is that not only am I absolutely committed to making sure that they maintain their qualitative military edge, and that they can deter any potential future attacks, but what I\u2019m willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighborhood, including Iran, a clarity that if Israel were to be attacked by any state, that we would stand by them. And that, I think, should be ... sufficient to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see whether or not we can at least take the nuclear issue off the table.\u201dHe added: \u201cWhat I would say to the Israeli people is ... that there is no formula, there is no option, to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon that will be more effective than the diplomatic initiative and framework that we put forward \u2014 and that\u2019s demonstrable.\u201dThe president gave voice, though \u2014 in a more emotional and personal way than I\u2019ve ever heard \u2014 to his distress at being depicted in Israel and among American Jews as somehow anti-Israel, when his views on peace are shared by many center-left Israelis and his administration has been acknowledged by Israeli officials to have been as vigorous as any in maintaining Israel\u2019s strategic edge.With huge amounts of conservative campaign money now flowing to candidates espousing pro-Israel views, which party is more supportive of Israel is becoming a wedge issue, an arms race, with Republican candidates competing over who can be the most unreservedly supportive of Israel in any disagreement with the United States, and ordinary, pro-Israel Democrats increasingly feeling sidelined.\u201cThis is an area that I\u2019ve been concerned about,\u201d the president said. \u201cLook, Israel is a robust, rowdy democracy. ... We share so much. We share blood, family. ... And part of what has always made the U.S.-Israeli relationship so special is that it has transcended party, and I think that has to be preserved. There has to be the ability for me to disagree with a policy on settlements, for example, without being viewed as ... opposing Israel. There has to be a way for Prime Minister Netanyahu to disagree with me on policy without being viewed as anti-Democrat, and I think the right way to do it is to recognize that as many commonalities as we have, there are going to be strategic differences. And I think that it is important for each side to respect the debate that takes place in the other country and not try to work just with one side. ... But this has been as hard as anything I do because of the deep affinities that I feel for the Israeli people and for the Jewish people. It\u2019s been a hard period.\u201dYou take it personally? I asked.\u201cIt has been personally difficult for me to hear ... expressions that somehow ... this administration has not done everything it could to look out for Israel\u2019s interest \u2014 and the suggestion that when we have very serious policy differences, that that\u2019s not in the context of a deep and abiding friendship and concern and understanding of the threats that the Jewish people have faced historically and continue to face.\u201dAs for protecting our Sunni Arab allies, like Saudi Arabia, the president said, they have some very real external threats, but they also have some internal threats \u2014 \u201cpopulations that, in some cases, are alienated, youth that are underemployed, an ideology that is destructive and nihilistic, and in some cases, just a belief that there are no legitimate political outlets for grievances. And so part of our job is to work with these states and say, \u2018How can we build your defense capabilities against external threats, but also, how can we strengthen the body politic in these countries, so that Sunni youth feel that they\u2019ve got something other than [the Islamic State, or ISIS] to choose from. ... I think the biggest threats that they face may not be coming from Iran invading. It\u2019s going to be from dissatisfaction inside their own countries. ... That\u2019s a tough conversation to have, but it\u2019s one that we have to have.\u201dThat said, the Iran deal is far from finished. As the president cautioned: \u201cWe\u2019re not done yet. There are a lot of details to be worked out, and you could see backtracking and slippage and real political difficulties, both in Iran and obviously here in the United States Congress.\u201dOn Congress\u2019s role, Obama said he insists on preserving the presidential prerogative to enter into binding agreements with foreign powers without congressional approval. However, he added, \u201cI do think that [Tennessee Republican] Senator Corker, the head of the Foreign Relations Committee, is somebody who is sincerely concerned about this issue and is a good and decent man, and my hope is that we can find something that allows Congress to express itself but does not encroach on traditional presidential prerogatives \u2014 and ensures that, if in fact we get a good deal, that we can go ahead and implement it.\u201dSince President Obama has had more direct and indirect dealings with Iran\u2019s leadership \u2014 including an exchange of numerous letters with Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \u2014 than any of his predecessors since Iran\u2019s revolution in 1979, I asked what he has learned from the back and forth.\u201cI think that it\u2019s important to recognize that Iran is a complicated country \u2014 just like we\u2019re a complicated country,\u201d the president said. \u201cThere is no doubt that, given the history between our two countries, that there is deep mistrust that is not going to fade away immediately. The activities that they engage in, the rhetoric, both anti-American, anti-Semitic, anti-Israel, is deeply disturbing. There are deep trends in the country that are contrary to not only our own national security interests and views but those of our allies and friends in the region, and those divisions are real.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cwhat we\u2019ve also seen is that there is a practical streak to the Iranian regime. I think they are concerned about self-preservation. I think they are responsive, to some degree, to their publics. I think the election of [President Hassan] Rouhani indicated that there was an appetite among the Iranian people for a rejoining with the international community, an emphasis on the economics and the desire to link up with a global economy. And so what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years, I think, is the opportunity for those forces within Iran that want to break out of the rigid framework that they have been in for a long time to move in a different direction. It\u2019s not a radical break, but it\u2019s one that I think offers us the chance for a different type of relationship, and this nuclear deal, I think, is a potential expression of that.\u201dWhat about Iran\u2019s supreme leader, who will be the ultimate decider there on whether or not Iran moves ahead? What have you learned about him?\u201cHe\u2019s a pretty tough read,\u201d the president said. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him directly. In the letters that he sends, there [are] typically a lot of reminders of what he perceives as past grievances against Iran, but what is, I think, telling is that he did give his negotiators in this deal the leeway, the capability to make important concessions, that would allow this framework agreement to come to fruition. So what that tells me is that \u2014 although he is deeply suspicious of the West [and] very insular in how he thinks about international issues as well as domestic issues, and deeply conservative \u2014 he does realize that the sanctions regime that we put together was weakening Iran over the long term, and that if in fact he wanted to see Iran re-enter the community of nations, then there were going to have to be changes.\u201dSince he has acknowledged Israel\u2019s concerns, and the fact that they are widely shared there, if the president had a chance to make his case for this framework deal directly to the Israeli people, what would he say?\u201cWell, what I\u2019d say to them is this,\u201d the president answered. \u201cYou have every right to be concerned about Iran. This is a regime that at the highest levels has expressed the desire to destroy Israel, that has denied the Holocaust, that has expressed venomous anti-Semitic ideas and is a big country with a big population and has a sophisticated military. So Israel is right to be concerned about Iran, and they should be absolutely concerned that Iran doesn\u2019t get a nuclear weapon.\u201d But, he insisted, this framework initiative, if it can be implemented, can satisfy that Israeli strategic concern with more effectiveness and at less cost to Israel than any other approach. \u201cWe know that a military strike or a series of military strikes can set back Iran\u2019s nuclear program for a period of time \u2014 but almost certainly will prompt Iran to rush towards a bomb, will provide an excuse for hard-liners inside of Iran to say, \u2018This is what happens when you don\u2019t have a nuclear weapon: America attacks.\u2019\u201cWe know that if we do nothing, other than just maintain sanctions, that they will continue with the building of their nuclear infrastructure and we\u2019ll have less insight into what exactly is happening,\u201d Obama added. \u201cSo this may not be optimal. In a perfect world, Iran would say, \u2018We won\u2019t have any nuclear infrastructure at all,\u2019 but what we know is that this has become a matter of pride and nationalism for Iran. Even those who we consider moderates and reformers are supportive of some nuclear program inside of Iran, and given that they will not capitulate completely, given that they can\u2019t meet the threshold that Prime Minister Netanyahu sets forth, there are no Iranian leaders who will do that. And given the fact that this is a country that withstood an eight-year war and a million people dead, they\u2019ve shown themselves willing, I think, to endure hardship when they considered a point of national pride or, in some cases, national survival.\u201dThe president continued: \u201cFor us to examine those options and say to ourselves, \u2018You know what, if we can have vigorous inspections, unprecedented, and we know at every point along their nuclear chain exactly what they\u2019re doing and that lasts for 20 years, and for the first 10 years their program is not just frozen but effectively rolled back to a larger degree, and we know that even if they wanted to cheat we would have at least a year, which is about three times longer than we\u2019d have right now, and we would have insights into their programs that we\u2019ve never had before,\u2019 in that circumstance, the notion that we wouldn\u2019t take that deal right now and that that would not be in Israel\u2019s interest is simply incorrect.\u201dBecause, Obama argued, \u201cthe one thing that changes the equation is when these countries get a nuclear weapon. ... Witness North Korea, which is a problem state that is rendered a lot more dangerous because of their nuclear program. If we can prevent that from happening anyplace else in the world, that\u2019s something where it\u2019s worth taking some risks.\u201d\u201cI have to respect the fears that the Israeli people have,\u201d he added, \u201cand I understand that Prime Minister Netanyahu is expressing the deep-rooted concerns that a lot of the Israeli population feel about this, but what I can say to them is: Number one, this is our best bet by far to make sure Iran doesn\u2019t get a nuclear weapon, and number two, what we will be doing even as we enter into this deal is sending a very clear message to the Iranians and to the entire region that if anybody messes with Israel, America will be there. And I think the combination of a diplomatic path that puts the nuclear issue to one side \u2014 while at the same time sending a clear message to the Iranians that you have to change your behavior more broadly and that we are going to protect our allies if you continue to engage in destabilizing aggressive activity \u2014 I think that\u2019s a combination that potentially at least not only assures our friends, but starts bringing down the temperature.\u201dThere is clearly a debate going on inside Iran as to whether the country should go ahead with this framework deal as well, so what would the president say to the Iranian people to persuade them that this deal is in their interest?If their leaders really are telling the truth that Iran is not seeking a nuclear weapon, the president said, then \u201cthe notion that they would want to expend so much on a symbolic program as opposed to harnessing the incredible talents and ingenuity and entrepreneurship of the Iranian people, and be part of the world economy and see their nation excel in those terms, that should be a pretty straightforward choice for them. Iran doesn\u2019t need nuclear weapons to be a powerhouse in the region. For that matter, what I\u2019d say to the Iranian people is: You don\u2019t need to be anti-Semitic or anti-Israel or anti-Sunni to be a powerhouse in the region. I mean, the truth is, Iran has all these potential assets going for it where, if it was a responsible international player, if it did not engage in aggressive rhetoric against its neighbors, if it didn\u2019t express anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish sentiment, if it maintained a military that was sufficient to protect itself, but was not engaging in a whole bunch of proxy wars around the region, by virtue of its size, its resources and its people it would be an extremely successful regional power. And so my hope is that the Iranian people begin to recognize that.\u201dClearly, he added, \u201cpart of the psychology of Iran is rooted in past experiences, the sense that their country was undermined, that the United States or the West meddled in first their democracy and then in supporting the Shah and then in supporting Iraq and Saddam during that extremely brutal war. So part of what I\u2019ve told my team is we have to distinguish between the ideologically driven, offensive Iran and the defensive Iran that feels vulnerable and sometimes may be reacting because they perceive that as the only way that they can avoid repeats of the past. ... But if we\u2019re able to get this done, then what may happen \u2014 and I\u2019m not counting on it \u2014 but what may happen is that those forces inside of Iran that say, \u2018We don\u2019t need to view ourselves entirely through the lens of our war machine. Let\u2019s excel in science and technology and job creation and developing our people,\u2019 that those folks get stronger. ... I say that emphasizing that the nuclear deal that we\u2019ve put together is not based on the idea that somehow the regime changes.\u201cIt is a good deal even if Iran doesn\u2019t change at all,\u201d Obama argued. \u201cEven for somebody who believes, as I suspect Prime Minister Netanyahu believes, that there is no difference between Rouhani and the supreme leader and they\u2019re all adamantly anti-West and anti-Israel and perennial liars and cheaters \u2014 even if you believed all that, this still would be the right thing to do. It would still be the best option for us to protect ourselves. In fact, you could argue that if they are implacably opposed to us, all the more reason for us to want to have a deal in which we know what they\u2019re doing and that, for a long period of time, we can prevent them from having a nuclear weapon.\u201dThere are several very sensitive points in the framework agreement that are not clear to me, and I asked the president for his interpretation. For instance, if we suspect that Iran is cheating, is harboring a covert nuclear program outside of the declared nuclear facilities covered in this deal \u2014 say, at a military base in southeastern Iran \u2014 do we have the right to insist on that facility being examined by international inspectors?\u201cIn the first instance, what we have agreed to is that we will be able to inspect and verify what\u2019s happening along the entire nuclear chain from the uranium mines all the way through to the final facilities like Natanz,\u201d the president said. \u201cWhat that means is that we\u2019re not just going to have a bunch of folks posted at two or three or five sites. We are going to be able to see what they\u2019re doing across the board, and in fact, if they now wanted to initiate a covert program that was designed to produce a nuclear weapon, they\u2019d have to create a whole different supply chain. That\u2019s point number one. Point number two, we\u2019re actually going to be setting up a procurement committee that examines what they\u2019re importing, what they\u2019re bringing in that they might claim as dual-use, to determine whether or not what they\u2019re using is something that would be appropriate for a peaceful nuclear program versus a weapons program. And number three, what we\u2019re going to be doing is setting up a mechanism whereby, yes, I.A.E.A. [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspectors can go anyplace.\u201dAnywhere in Iran? I asked.\u201cThat we suspect,\u201d the president answered. \u201cObviously, a request will have to be made. Iran could object, but what we have done is to try to design a mechanism whereby once those objections are heard, that it is not a final veto that Iran has, but in fact some sort of international mechanism will be in place that makes a fair assessment as to whether there should be an inspection, and if they determine it should be, that\u2019s the tiebreaker, not Iran saying, \u2018No, you can\u2019t come here.\u2019 So over all, what we\u2019re seeing is not just the additional protocols that I.A.E.A. has imposed on countries that are suspected of in the past having had problematic nuclear programs, we\u2019re going even beyond that, and Iran will be subject to the kinds of inspections and verification mechanisms that have never been put in place before.\u201dA lot of people, myself included, will want to see the fine print on that. Another issue that doesn\u2019t seem to have been resolved yet is: When exactly do the economic sanctions on Iran get lifted? When the implementation begins? When Iran has been deemed to be complying fully?\u201cThere are still details to be worked out,\u201d the president said, \u201cbut I think that the basic framework calls for Iran to take the steps that it needs to around [the Fordow enrichment facility], the centrifuges, and so forth. At that point, then, the U.N. sanctions are suspended; although the sanctions related to proliferation, the sanctions related to ballistic missiles, there\u2019s a set of sanctions that remain in place. At that point, then, we preserve the ability to snap back those sanctions, if there is a violation. If not, though, Iran, outside of the proliferation and ballistic missile issues that stay in place, they\u2019re able to get out from under the sanctions, understanding that this constant monitoring will potentially trigger some sort of action if they\u2019re in violation.\u201dThere are still United States sanctions that are related to Iran\u2019s behavior in terrorism and human rights abuse, though, the president added: \u201cThere are certain sanctions that we have that would remain in place because they\u2019re not related to Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and this, I think, gets to a central point that we\u2019ve made consistently. If in fact we are able to finalize the nuclear deal, and if Iran abides by it, that\u2019s a big piece of business that we\u2019ve gotten done, but it does not end our problems with Iran, and we are still going to be aggressively working with our allies and friends to reduce \u2014 and hopefully at some point stop \u2014 the destabilizing activities that Iran has engaged in, the sponsorship of terrorist organizations. And that may take some time. But it\u2019s our belief, it\u2019s my belief, that we will be in a stronger position to do so if the nuclear issue has been put in a box. And if we can do that, it\u2019s possible that Iran, seeing the benefits of sanctions relief, starts focusing more on the economy and its people. And investment starts coming in, and the country starts opening up. If we\u2019ve done a good job in bolstering the sense of security and defense cooperation between us and the Sunni states, if we have made even more certain that the Israeli people are absolutely protected not just by their own capacities, but also by our commitments, then what\u2019s possible is you start seeing an equilibrium in the region, and Sunni and Shia, Saudi and Iran start saying, \u2018Maybe we should lower tensions and focus on the extremists like [ISIS] that would burn down this entire region if they could.\u2019 \u201dRegarding America\u2019s Sunni Arab allies, Obama reiterated that while he is prepared to help increase their military capabilities they also need to increase their willingness to commit their ground troops to solving regional problems.\u201cThe conversations I want to have with the Gulf countries is, first and foremost, how do they build more effective defense capabilities,\u201d the president said. \u201cI think when you look at what happens in Syria, for example, there\u2019s been a great desire for the United States to get in there and do something. But the question is: Why is it that we can\u2019t have Arabs fighting [against] the terrible human rights abuses that have been perpetrated, or fighting against what Assad has done? I also think that I can send a message to them about the U.S.\u2019s commitments to work with them and ensure that they are not invaded from the outside, and that perhaps will ease some of their concerns and allow them to have a more fruitful conversation with the Iranians. What I can\u2019t do, though, is commit to dealing with some of these internal issues that they have without them making some changes that are more responsive to their people.\u201dOne way to think about it, Obama continued, \u201cis [that] when it comes to external aggression, I think we\u2019re going to be there for our [Arab] friends \u2014 and I want to see how we can formalize that a little bit more than we currently have, and also help build their capacity so that they feel more confident about their ability to protect themselves from external aggression.\u201d But, he repeated, \u201cThe biggest threats that they face may not be coming from Iran invading. It\u2019s going to be from dissatisfaction inside their own countries. Now disentangling that from real terrorist activity inside their country, how we sort that out, how we engage in the counterterrorism cooperation that\u2019s been so important to our own security \u2014 without automatically legitimizing or validating whatever repressive tactics they may employ \u2014 I think that\u2019s a tough conversation to have, but it\u2019s one that we have to have.\u201dIt feels lately like some traditional boundaries between the executive and legislative branches, when it comes to the conduct of American foreign policy, have been breached. For instance, there was the letter from 47 Republican senators to Iran\u2019s supreme leader cautioning him on striking any deal with Obama not endorsed by them \u2014 coming in the wake of Prime Minister Netanyahu being invited by the speaker of the House, John Boehner, to address a joint session of Congress \u2014 without consulting the White House. How is Obama taking this?\u201cI do worry that some traditional boundaries in how we think about foreign policy have been crossed,\u201d the president said. \u201cI felt the letter that was sent to the supreme leader was inappropriate. I think that you will recall there were some deep disagreements with President Bush about the Iraq war, but the notion that you would have had a whole bunch of Democrats sending letters to leaders in the region or to European leaders ... trying to undermine the president\u2019s policies I think is troubling.\u201cThe bottom line,\u201d he added, \u201cis that we\u2019re going to have serious debates, serious disagreements, and I welcome those because that\u2019s how our democracy is supposed to work, and in today\u2019s international environment, whatever arguments we have here, other people are hearing and reading about it. It\u2019s not a secret that the Republicans may feel more affinity with Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s views of the Iran issue than they do with mine. But [we need to be] keeping that within some formal boundaries, so that the executive branch, when it goes overseas, when it\u2019s communicating with foreign leaders, is understood to be speaking on behalf of the United States of America, not a divided United States of America, making sure that whether that president is a Democrat or a Republican that once the debates have been had here, that he or she is the spokesperson on behalf of U.S. foreign policy. And that\u2019s clear to every leader around the world. That\u2019s important because without that, what you start getting is multiple foreign policies, confusion among foreign powers as to who speaks for who, and that ends up being a very dangerous \u2014 circumstances that could be exploited by our enemies and could deeply disturb our friends.\u201dAs for the Obama doctrine \u2014 \u201cwe will engage, but we preserve all our capabilities\u201d \u2014 the president concluded: \u201cI\u2019ve been very clear that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon on my watch, and I think they should understand that we mean it. But I say that hoping that we can conclude this diplomatic arrangement \u2014 and that it ushers a new era in U.S.-Iranian relations \u2014 and, just as importantly, over time, a new era in Iranian relations with its neighbors.\u201dWhatever happened in the past, he said, \u201cat this point, the U.S.\u2019s core interests in the region are not oil, are not territorial. ... Our core interests are that everybody is living in peace, that it is orderly, that our allies are not being attacked, that children are not having barrel bombs dropped on them, that massive displacements aren\u2019t taking place. Our interests in this sense are really just making sure that the region is working. And if it\u2019s working well, then we\u2019ll do fine. And that\u2019s going to be a big project, given what\u2019s taken place, but I think this [Iran framework deal] is at least one place to start.\u201dCharles M.

{"Headline": "The Chinese Billionaire Zhang Lei Spins Research Into Investment Gold", "Date": "2015-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 With an $18 billion war chest, he is one of China\u2019s richest investors. Yet on a recent trip to San Francisco, Zhang Lei and his entourage crammed into a three-bedroom house in the Mission District, rented through Airbnb. He also ordered water from Instacart, the on-demand grocery delivery service. A few days later in New York, he bought food through Google Express. Of course, it is not as if he could not afford luxury hotels and restaurants. Instead, it was research. Mr. Zhang just wanted to get to know some of the businesses he might one day invest in.Starting 10 years ago with $20 million from Yale University\u2019s endowment, Mr. Zhang was an early backer of companies like Tencent and JD.com, businesses that have shaken up traditional industries across China. Now he thinks these companies could stir things up globally.Across the ocean in Silicon Valley, Mr. Zhang represents China\u2019s new entrepreneurial class. He has consulted with the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, and visited with start-ups like Airbnb.To outsiders, Hillhouse is a mysterious firm led by a secretive man who happened to strike gold early on. To his investors \u2014 which include the endowments for prestigious universities like M.I.T. and Yale, sovereign wealth funds and wealthy entrepreneurs \u2014 he seems incapable of making a bad bet. But as China\u2019s economy hits a series of economic road bumps, his next set of investments could define his legacy.The firm says little about its investors or its investing record, emphasizing only that it holds on to investments for long stretches. One investor said that Hillhouse had returned a yearly average of 39 percent since it was founded in 2005.With bulging coffers, Mr. Zhang and Hillhouse are looking to the United States in search of more opportunities.In his most recent deal, Hillhouse teamed up with the Mayo Clinic to bring one of America\u2019s best-known health care institutions to China. Mr. Zhang hopes to upend the rickety state health care system, which is in severe need of a turnaround, using modern technology to create new services and products like a digital records management system.Mr. Zhang says he is up to the task.A bespectacled and energetic man with a casual demeanor that belies his great wealth, Mr. Zhang has an unusual background. He was born in 1972 in Zhumadian, Henan Province, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, when China was purging itself of all things even remotely capitalistic. He came of age just as his country was embracing capitalist reforms.At 7, Mr. Zhang had his first business idea. He rented his comic books to passengers waiting for their trains. Today, that shared-economy concept is the basis for Silicon Valley companies like Uber and Airbnb.His other forward-thinking ideas were not always met with enthusiasm. Not long after securing a scholarship to the Yale School of Management in 1999, Mr. Zhang started applying for Wall Street jobs. No one asked him back. One interviewer went so far as to question his intellectual capacity when Mr. Zhang asked whether there was any point to gas stations.\u201cAlmost immediately, Lei was exceptional in that he had really great insights,\u201d said Dean Takahashi, senior director at the Yale endowment, adding that Mr. Zhang was able to identify what was going to be a great business. He was also an inveterate networker, introducing successful Chinese entrepreneurs through the Hillhouse Club, which he founded on Yale\u2019s campus and named after Hillhouse Avenue, where some of his classes were held. \u201cIt was like, why in the world does this kid from China have these insights?\u201d Mr. Takahashi said.At the endowment, Mr. Zhang was sent to research industries like timber and would return weeks later with inch-thick reports. This tradition has carried on at his firm. Analysts spent years researching before Hillhouse struck the deal with the Mayo Clinic.After his first year at Yale, Mr. Zhang took time off to research China\u2019s expanding private sector, knocking on the doors of entrepreneurs like Jack Ma of Alibaba, Robin Li of Baidu and Pony Ma of Tencent, and cultivating friendships. He returned to the United States after the Internet bubble burst, in 2001.Four years later, with an M.B.A. in hand, he persuaded Yale to give him $20 million to invest in new companies in China. His initial pitch was met with hesitation. He was green, former Yale endowment colleagues recall, so green that he did not know whom to hire. Mr. Zhang called up old friends. One friend declined the offer but suggested his wife.\u201cI said, \u2018Are you serious? You\u2019re just going to dump me and send your wife?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Zhang recalled. The wife, Tracy Ma, is now the chief operating officer of Hillhouse and No. 2 at the firm.Mr. Zhang still jokes about the early days. \u201cWhen I started Hillhouse, I had this weird strategy and it sounded distracted,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s why no one else invested in me other than Yale.\u201dFor Yale, which had $15 billion under management in 2005, it was a relatively small wager on China and on a young man who the endowment thought showed a lot of potential.One of Mr. Zhang\u2019s first bets was on Tencent; he bought the stock in 2005. Back then the company was best known for its QQ messaging service and was worth less than $2 billion. Today, Tencent is an Internet giant worth nearly $180 billion. \u201cLooking back now I think, wow, Tencent was so cheap,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. Hillhouse still owns the stock.Other investments yielded knockout returns. In 2010, Hillhouse invested $255 million in JD.com. Four years later, that stake was worth $3.9 billion at JD.com\u2019s initial public offering. When Tencent paid $215 million for a 15 percent stake in JD.com in 2014, Mr. Zhang was involved behind the scenes, according to two people involved in the deal who were not authorized to speak publicly.Hillhouse\u2019s buy-and-hold strategy makes it more of a private equity firm than a hedge fund. Its investors are willing to lock up their money for extended periods.This gives Mr. Zhang leeway to invest in private companies like Blue Moon, a Chinese consumer goods producer. In 2006, when Mr. Zhang first met the husband-and-wife team who founded Blue Moon, they were selling liquid hand soap. He stayed in touch. Several years later, they called him up to say they had created a new kind of liquid detergent.A light bulb went on. At that time, in 2010, most multinational companies were selling powdered detergent in China because they thought consumers would not pay more for liquid detergent. But Mr. Zhang believed they would, and he persuaded Blue Moon to expand heavily in liquid detergent, bankrolling its expansion in exchange for a stake in the company.Now, Mr. Zhang wagers it can be a multibillion-dollar brand that will compete with the likes of Tide. Hillhouse has made similar bets on companies like Gree, now a leading maker of air-conditioners globally, and Midea, a manufacturer of electric appliances.\u201cI\u2019m seeing an uprising of Chinese entrepreneurs who are able to upgrade themselves versus the relatively slow-moving multinational companies,\u201d Mr. Zhang said, adding that American companies can learn a thing or two from their Chinese counterparts, who have learned to leapfrog traditional industries.It is a skill he knows something about \u2014 not just in his jump from humble beginnings to billionaire status in a few short years but also in his passion for daredevil sports. During a skiing trip to Telluride, Colo., in February, he was the one going down the steepest slopes in a straight line.Investing in China, he said, is \u201cnot for the faint of heart.\u201d But, he added, the opportunities are vast, \u201cif you are open-minded and you focus on the future of China.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Uses a Visit to the Everglades to Press His Climate Agenda", "Date": "2015-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe message was an effort to reinforce what the president hopes will be a central part of his legacy: a sustained push to get the United States and the rest of the world to confront the effects of climate change.Mr. Obama steered clear of directly confronting Mr. Bush, Mr. Rubio or any other Republicans. But he left little doubt that he intended to raise pressure on those who oppose policies to address the warming of the planet.\u201cClimate change can no longer be denied,\u201d Mr. Obama said after seeing alligators during a walking tour in the park. \u201cIt can\u2019t be edited out. It can\u2019t be omitted from the conversation. And action can no longer be delayed.\u201dWhite House officials believe that using the muggy backdrop of the Everglades to demand action will help put pressure on Mr. Bush, who is likely to run for president, and Mr. Rubio, who has declared his candidacy, to address the issue.Mr. Rubio has repeatedly questioned the established science of human-caused climate change. Mr. Bush made restoration of the wetlands a priority during his tenure as governor, but in recent years he has expressed some doubt about the role of humans in the planet\u2019s warming.Despite that doubt, Mr. Bush said in New Hampshire this month that the United States should negotiate with the rest of the world on reducing carbon emissions. In his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Obama praised former Republican presidents like Theodore Roosevelt, who started the national park system, and Richard M. Nixon, who created the Environmental Protection Agency.\u201cSimply refusing to say the words \u2018climate change\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean that climate change isn\u2019t happening,\u201d Mr. Obama said.The president\u2019s remarks on Wednesday were part of a broader effort to build political support for his climate change agenda. This summer, he is expected to unveil a final set of regulations to cut planet-warming carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. Republicans have called the rules a \u201cwar on coal\u201d that could lead to the shutdown of hundreds of coal plants.To build support for the policy, Mr. Obama has made the case that an unchecked increase in greenhouse gases is already wreaking economic havoc across the United States, as the warming of the planet leads to rising sea levels, intensified droughts and heavier rainstorms.Several Democratic strategists said they intended to highlight the issue of climate change as the 2016 campaign progresses, with a particular focus on Florida Republicans. The idea, the strategists said, would be to cast Republicans who avoid, question or deny the science of climate change as out of touch with both the consensus of experts and the views of a majority of voters.They see Florida as a particularly attractive target for that line of attack. A 2014 report by 13 federal agencies, the National Climate Assessment, named Miami one of the cities most vulnerable to severe economic harm from rising sea levels. An analysis released this month by the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication found that a majority of people in Florida \u2014 56 percent \u2014 accept the science that climate change is caused by human activities.Joseph Uscinski, a professor of political science at the University of Miami, said he doubted that focusing on climate change would make much of a difference for any of the presidential candidates.\u201cIf you look at polls, what do you think the most important problem is?\u201d Mr. Uscinski said. \u201cThe No. 1 answer is always the economy. If you are going to talk about something they care about, it\u2019s always going to be the economy.\u201dBut Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters that the subject was important enough that it should be a central part of the discussion among elected officials and candidates.\u201cWhat is fair to say about the president\u2019s efforts on this issue,\u201d Mr. Earnest said, is that \u201cthe president is very interested in fostering a public dialogue about what the U.S. and its leaders in government can do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hospitals Provide a Pulse in Struggling Rural Towns", "Date": "2015-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Shifting MiddleThe Beatrice Community Hospital and Health Center in Beatrice, Neb., moved three years ago to a new building on the edge of town. Beatrice is like many rural American communities that have suffered from the decline of manufacturing, but the hospital is helping resuscitate this town of 12,000.BEATRICE, Neb. \u2014 \u201cThis real estate to be auctioned,\u201d reads a banner stretched across the abandoned warehouse of a store-shelving manufacturer that once employed generations living in and around this town of about 12,000.This isolated rural community has lost a lot of the energy of its heyday, when shoppers roamed downtown sidewalks, freight trains rumbled past the Big Blue River, and streets clogged at quitting time as factory workers spilled out of their plants.But it has yet to lose its economic pulse, thanks in large measure to the Beatrice Community Hospital and Health Center, housed in a sprawling new building of concrete and green glimmering windows on the outskirts of town. The hospital has become an economic anchor for the area.Once home to vibrant downtowns, along with thriving local manufacturers and merchants, small towns were traditionally strongholds of the American middle class. In recent decades, many barely managed to hold on as young people migrated to cities and those who stayed behind had trouble even finding work.Now, however, those towns that have been able to attract hospitals and other health care facilities have emerged as oases of economic stability across the nation\u2019s heartland.Rural hospitals face huge challenges; nearly 50 of them have closed in the last four years, according to the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program. But the many successful hospitals, beyond providing an array of jobs from the bottom to the top of the economic ladder, also stimulate local spending and help attract new businesses that offer a stable of insured patients.\u201cIt\u2019s feast or famine,\u201d said Brock Slabach, senior vice president for member services at the National Rural Health Association, a group based in Leawood, Kan., that advocates for rural health interests. \u201cWhat these providers do is offer not only access to health care, which is hugely important, but they contribute to the economic viability of these rural areas.\u201dResidents of Beatrice (pronounced bee-AT-ress) do not have to look far for towns that have shriveled since the railroads pulled out and Walmart lured away hometown shoppers. Ghost towns ring Beatrice, with nothing left beyond an old grain elevator or graveyard.The nonprofit Beatrice hospital, with a payroll of nearly $28 million, is an essential economic engine. After the Beatrice State Developmental Center, which employs 700, the 25-bed hospital and its network of clinics and home care services is the second-largest employer in town, with 512 workers. Revenue has grown from $45 million in 2004 to more than $100 million last year, according to Thomas Sommers, the hospital\u2019s chief executive. Patient visits between 2009 and the end of last year have nearly doubled.That salary goes a long way in a community where movie tickets cost $6 and a recently remodeled three-bedroom, two-bath home with a two-car garage is on the market for $72,500.That formula has also worked for a hospital in Batesville, Ind., roughly an hour\u2019s drive from both Cincinnati and Indianapolis, a region where the manufacturing base has been eroded by waves of layoffs through the years. The top employers in the town of about 6,500 are a maker of hospital beds and a coffin company. With 550 employees, the Margaret Mary Community Hospital ranks third.\u201cIt\u2019s about gaining faith,\u201d said Tim Putnam, Margaret Mary\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe have to focus on what we do well and partner with others who can provide care that we can\u2019t.\u201dEven in the poorest communities, small hospitals can thrive. In Centreville, Miss., about 130 miles northwest of New Orleans, more than one-third of residents live below the poverty line. But in May the hospital in the town of 1,600 plans to open a new, $21 million facility, said Chad Netterville, chief executive of the Field Memorial Community Hospital, a quasi-public finstitution run by the two counties it serves.To afford the new 16-bed operation, officials turned to a federal economic development program intended to increase investments in low-income communities.\u201cA lot of times in the rural communities your health care systems are your economic drivers, and that\u2019s true here,\u201d Mr. Netterville said.He and a team of hospital officials traveled to Nebraska to tour the Beatrice hospital when it was under construction to glean ideas for their new building. \u201cI was impressed,\u201d he said.Surrounded by acres of corn fields and a John Deere tractor dealership, the 144,000-square-foot Beatrice hospital is on a vast plains landscape; the wind lashes across its parking lot with a ferocity that nearly knocks over frail visitors.Inside, the three-year-old building is like its own little city, bustling with activity. Workers mill about the atriumlike lobby and patients recover in window-lined rooms, each with a love seat, recliner and wooden rocking chair. In a sunny room that looks like a fitness center, an elderly man rides an exercise bike as his therapist takes notes.\u201cWe tried to design the facility for where we thought the future was going,\u201d Mr. Sommers, the chief executive, said.The hospital\u2019s biggest challenge has been improving its reputation; six years ago it came in dead last in a ranking of patient satisfaction at Nebraska hospitals. Residents bypassed it for bigger hospitals in Lincoln, the state capital, which is 40 miles away and home to the University of Nebraska.Mr. Sommers, who took over in 2004, started by reaching out to the community, encouraging professionals on staff to participate in a local radio program. He disclosed the hospital\u2019s financial information in hopes residents would feel more like stakeholders.The types of jobs that pay middle-class wages have shifted since 1980. Fewer of these positions are in male-dominated production occupations, while a greater share are in workplaces more open to women.The hospital hired more women doctors \u2014 a request that came up in a community phone survey \u2014 and put up billboards that showed nurses holding babies, saying, \u201cWe Deliver.\u201dMr. Sommers worked on giving staff more of a say in decisions and on attracting doctors who had family ties to the area in hopes of cutting down on turnover. He even offered better salaries than they might make in bigger cities. One moved from outside Aspen, Colo.; another picked Beatrice over the much bigger Wichita, Kan.\u201cI wanted to be able to still have a life outside of work,\u201d said Dr. Amanda Loeffler, 33, who wound up in Beatrice after seeing a flier in the mail advertising an opening for a general surgeon here. \u201cEverything you need is here, and there\u2019s a strong sense of community.\u201dThe Beatrice hospital now ranks above the national average in every category on Medicare\u2019s website for comparing hospitals. One of the chief complaints staff members hear today is about the long, windy walk to the front door from the parking lot. But part of a recently announced $7.2 million expansion will address that, adding a new entrance with closer parking as well as more space for its women and children\u2019s programs and its infusion center.Still, there are plenty of remaining hurdles. The county\u2019s population has been shrinking since its peak in 1910, and the community cannot rely on health care alone to sustain its economic base.\u201cWe can help drive the economy here in Gage County, but one of the things that has to happen is the economy has to pick up,\u201d Mr. Sommers said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t pick up, we can\u2019t drive it forever.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can You Learn to Lead?", "Date": "2015-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat does one learn at graduate business school? Business, one assumes. Or more to the point, the management of business. But peruse the website of any business school in the country \u2014 or in the world, for that matter \u2014 and you may come away thinking that the biggest topic they teach is \u201cleadership.\u201dThe dominant brand, Harvard Business School, claims to \u201ceducate leaders who make a difference in the world.\u201d The University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School does one better, developing \u201cleaders who make a positive difference in the world.\u201d Kellogg at Northwestern develops \u201cbrave leaders who inspire growth in people, organizations and markets.\u201d And Duke\u2019s Fuqua says it does what it does because \u201cthe world needs leaders of consequence.\u201dApparently, so do business schools: When asked by Charlie Rose in January why Harvard\u2019s president had tapped him to be the school\u2019s dean, Nitin Nohria attributed the choice to his \u201cbackground in leadership.\u201dIt hasn\u2019t always been this way. For much of the 20th century, the paragons of business education promised to create not leaders but managers, those economic actors whose emergence came about at the dawn of the mega-corporations, and whose power increased alongside them. The manager was the noble steward of the American economy, and would be so until the 1970s, when the nation turned on its management elite in the midst of a recession and accused it of negligence.Caught flat-footed selling a title, \u201cmanager,\u201d that had lost its social cachet, the ivory towers of business scrambled to find a new pitch. And they found it in leadership.Business schools\u2019 foray into the teaching of leadership can be traced to mid-1977, when Abraham Zaleznik, a Harvard professor, published a paper entitled \u201cManagers and Leaders: Are They Different?\u201d The answer was an emphatic yes. Leaders were visionaries who got the troops excited to march into battle. Managers were platoon sergeants who actually marched them into battle.You\u2019ll surely trip over the words leader and leadership on business school websites.But the questions were obvious from the start: Is leadership an emergent quality, both situational and context-specific? Or is it something you can actually teach? That is, can you be a leader without ever leading something? Business schools insist you can.In his 2007 history of the M.B.A., \u201cFrom Higher Aims to Hired Hands,\u201d Rakesh Khurana, dean of Harvard College and a professor of leadership development, delineated the various pedagogical approaches. Most lie along a spectrum, with explicit knowledge and theory on one end and skill and technique on the other. Kenan-Flagler at the University of North Carolina, for example, leans heavily on sociology and psychology in constructing a \u201cscientific\u201d approach to the task. Kellogg, Wharton at the University of Pennsylvania and Booth at the University of Chicago, on the other hand, emphasize role-playing and team-building exercises to develop leadership experience.A third approach involves a deep dive into one\u2019s own values and ideals, with the ultimate goal to be an \u201cauthentic\u201d enough leader that others will march to the tune you\u2019re playing. According to one course description at Harvard, authentic leaders \u201cexhibit high standards of integrity, take responsibility for their actions, and are guided by enduring principles rather than short-term experience.\u201d Leadership development, Dr. Khurana says, is \u201ca personal journey.\u201d Most schools incorporate all three approaches, addressing the tangible skills of leadership \u2014 the ability to work in teams, influence others, manage conflict and communicate.So who should teach all this? Fortune 500 C.E.O.s? Management gurus? Academics? Ann L. Cunliffe, an expert on organizational studies who now teaches at the University of Bradford in England, at first refused to teach a leadership course in an executive M.B.A. program \u2014 she didn\u2019t think a professor had any business telling seasoned executives how to lead. But she changed her position when it occurred to her that leading a business and leading a class involved the same challenges: \u201cthinking critically, seeing situations in new ways, being able to deal with uncertainty and ambiguity, learning from experience and mistakes, knowing yourself, and,\u201d she wrote in a 2009 paper, \u201cbeing passionate about what you do.\u201d Dr. Cunliffe calls this the \u201cphilosophy\u201d of leading. But it could also be called a philosophy of life.Which raises the question, once again, of whether leadership can be packaged and taught, rather than accumulated through experience.John Van Maanen, a professor of management at M.I.T. Sloan who teaches a course named \u201cLeading Organizations,\u201d isn\u2019t so sure it can. \u201cEven today, three-plus decades in, there\u2019s no real definition of it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can make people more conscious of ethical dilemmas in business, of the difficulty of directing people in times of adversity, and the confidence and communication skills necessary to do so. But the idea that such skills can be transmitted so that you can lead anybody at any time, that\u2019s ideologically vacuous.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s difficult not to be frustrated by the excessive focus on it,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s become so popular that we apparently can\u2019t teach enough of it.\u201dDr. Van Maanen is not alone in his skepticism. Doubts have always existed about whether there\u2019s truly an adequate theoretical foundation to leadership, opposed to the study of management, rooted as it is in the disciplines of modern business: finance, accounting, marketing, operations and the like. As Joseph C. Rost outlined in his 1991 book, \u201cLeadership for the 21st Century,\u201d the lack of agreement on the matter means that leadership is practically \u201canything anyone wants to say it is,\u201d and leaders are \u201canyone who is so designated.\u201dDuff McDonald is author of \u201cThe Firm: The Story of McKinsey and Its Secret Influence on American Business.\u201d He is writing a book about Harvard Business School.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Gives Visiting Iraqi Premier Aid and an Endorsement", "Date": "2015-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a 40-minute meeting that touched on war and sectarian divisions, Mr. Obama publicly credited Mr. Abadi with helping to turn the tide in the battle against the Islamic State extremists who seized much of his country last year and expressed confidence that the new Shiite-led government in Baghdad was doing more to include Sunni and Kurdish minorities.\u201cAlthough there is the natural back-and-forth that exists in any democracy, Prime Minister Abadi has kept true to his commitments to reach out to them and to respond to their concerns and to make sure that power is not solely concentrated within Baghdad,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters, with Mr. Abadi seated next to him in the Oval Office. He called Mr. Abadi \u201ca strong partner\u201d who has \u201cgained the respect of other leaders in the region.\u201dMr. Abadi assured Mr. Obama that he was cracking down on abuses. \u201cI have to admit that there are some violations, human rights violations, being committed by some criminal parties and outliers, but we have zero tolerance for any violations of human rights,\u201d Mr. Abadi said. \u201cAnd when we manage to catch these people, we are bringing them before the judicial system and we punish them.\u201dMr. Obama hoped to use the meeting to reinforce America\u2019s role in helping Iraq and building up Mr. Abadi\u2019s control of the war against the Islamic State, even as Iran directs Shiite militias in Iraq that are independent of the government. Iran\u2019s role was \u201cdiscussed extensively,\u201d the president said, and he insisted that \u201cany foreign assistance\u201d in the war \u201chas to go through the Iraqi government.\u201dMr. Abadi agreed. \u201cWe are also keen to bring all fighters under the control of the state and under the command of the commander of the armed forces,\u201d he said.In recognition of the civilian damage wrought by recent fighting around Tikrit and elsewhere, Mr. Obama committed $200 million to \u201chelp stabilize communities and to help those who have been displaced from their homes, have lost their jobs, have seen their property destroyed.\u201dIraq is facing a budget deficit this year of $22 billion, a sizable gap in a total budget of $105 billion. Oil revenue, which accounts for a vast majority of government income, has declined at the same time that the Iraqi government is facing the challenge of restoring essential services and rebuilding towns and cities damaged in the fighting against the Islamic State.Iraqi officials are counting on substantial international support. That includes the ability to draw on more than $2.4 billion in the currencies of some of the strongest members of the International Monetary Fund and $2 billion in assistance from the World Bank.Iraq would also like to obtain substantial loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank of the United States to finance the purchase of Boeing planes for Iraqi Airways.Mr. Obama said that the United States was \u201cpaying attention to the economy of Iraq\u201d and how it could maximize its oil resources and diversify its assets, but he made no specific commitment beyond the humanitarian aid.Mr. Abadi, who became prime minister in September, has appealed for economic support before. In a December meeting in Brussels, he asked for international help in rebuilding towns and cities that his government hoped to wrest from the control of the Islamic State.Mr. Abadi\u2019s trip comes at a pivotal moment. After retaking Tikrit, Saddam Hussein\u2019s hometown, with the help of American airstrikes, Iraq faces important questions about the course of the campaign against the Islamic State, the scale of the American effort in Iraq over the next year, and how to handle Iran\u2019s military role in training and advising Shiite militias.Mr. Abadi made a point of thanking Americans for their help, even as he sought more. \u201cThe American people have made great sacrifices for the sake of Iraq, and the blood of its sons and daughters is mixed also with the blood of the Iraqis,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can assure you that these sacrifices will not go to waste.\u201dMr. Abadi also met with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and had a schedule of other meetings with Mr. Kerry and Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter. He will also see the House speaker, John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio; the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky; and other ranking lawmakers. He will appear at a think tank and a U.S. Chamber of Commerce reception and give a series of interviews.On Tuesday, Mr. Abadi was scheduled to meet with Iraqi pilots who are being trained in the United States to fly F-16s. Iraqi officials said that 14 pilots were scheduled to be trained by September, when the Iraqi military hopes to start flying the planes in Iraq.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s Up With You?", "Date": "2015-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoth countries almost take for granted the ties that bind them today: the $600 billion in annual bilateral trade; the 275,000 Chinese studying in America, and the 25,000 Americans studying in China; the fact that China is now America\u2019s largest agricultural market and the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt; and the fact that last year Chinese investment in the United States for the first time exceeded American investment in China.But dig underneath and you find these two systems increasingly baffled by the other. Chinese officials still have not gotten over their profound shock at how the United States \u2014 a country they took as an economic model and the place where many of them learned capitalism \u2014 could have become so reckless as to trigger the 2008 global subprime mortgage meltdown, which started the trope in China that America is a superpower in decline.Chinese officials were also baffled by an effort by President Obama\u2019s team to resist China\u2019s establishment of an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, by lobbying our biggest economic allies \u2014 South Korea, Australia, France, Germany, Italy and Britain \u2014 not to join. While the Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, kept stressing publicly, and responsibly, that the only American concern was that the bank operate by international standards, other Obama officials actively pressed U.S. allies to stay out. Except for Japan, they all snubbed Washington and joined the Chinese-led bank. The whole episode only empowered Beijing hard-liners who argue that the United States just wants to keep China down and can\u2019t really accommodate it as a stakeholder.Americans, though, are asking of President Xi: \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d Xi\u2019s anti-corruption campaign is clearly aimed at stifling the biggest threat to any one-party system: losing its legitimacy because of rampant corruption. But he also seems to be taking out potential political rivals as well. Xi has assumed more control over the military, economic and political levers of power in China than any leader since Mao. But to what end \u2014 to reform or to stay the same?Xi is \u201camassing power to maintain the Communist Party\u2019s supremacy,\u201d argued Willy Wo-Lap Lam, author of \u201cChinese Politics in the Era of Xi Jinping: Renaissance, Reform or Retrogression?\u201d Xi \u201cbelieves one reason behind the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse is that the party lost control of the army and the economy.\u201d But Xi seems to be more focused on how the Soviet Union collapsed than how America succeeded, and that is not good. His crackdown has not only been on corruption, which is freezing a lot of officials from making any big decisions, but on even the mildest forms of dissent. Foreign textbooks used by universities are being censored, and blogging and searching on China\u2019s main Internet sites have never been more controlled. Don\u2019t even think about using Google there or reading Western newspapers online.But, at the same time, Xi has begun a huge push for \u201cinnovation,\u201d for transforming China\u2019s economy from manufacturing and assembly to more knowledge-intensive work, so this one-child generation will be able to afford to take care of two retiring parents in a country with an inadequate social-safety net.Alas, crackdowns don\u2019t tend to produce start-ups.As Antoine van Agtmael, the investor who coined the term \u201cemerging markets,\u201d said to me: China is making it harder to innovate in China precisely when rising labor costs in China and rising innovation in America are spurring more companies to build their next plant in the United States, not China. The combination of cheap energy in America and more flexible, open innovation \u2014 where universities and start-ups share brainpower with companies to spin off discoveries; where manufacturers use a new generation of robots and 3-D printers that allow more production to go local; and where new products integrate wirelessly connected sensors with new materials to become smarter, faster than ever \u2014 is making America, says van Agtmael, \u201cthe next great emerging market.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a paradigm shift,\u201d he added. \u201cThe last 25 years was all about who could make things cheapest, and the next 25 years will be about who can make things smartest.\u201dPresident Xi seems to be betting that China is big enough and smart enough to curb the Internet and political speech just enough to prevent dissent but not enough to choke off innovation. This is the biggest bet in the world today. And if he\u2019s wrong (and color me dubious) we\u2019re all going to feel it.Thomas L. Friedman\u2019s column on Wednesday misspelled the location of China\u2019s annual Boao Forum on Asia. It is on Hainan Island, not Hainin Island.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Prada Foundation\u2019s New Arts Complex in Milan", "Date": "2015-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRecently, however, the Prada Foundation has set its sights on establishing permanent homes to present exhibitions and to show its vast holdings of art, mostly works from the 1950s to the present. Four years ago, it opened an outpost in an 18th-century palazzo on the Grand Canal in Venice. Now it is putting down roots on the site of an old distillery in a scruffy industrial neighborhood here. The Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas and his firm OMA have created a sprawling complex with nearly 120,000 square feet of exhibition space that, when it opens on May 9, is poised to become a major international destination for the arts.\u201cAfter more than 20 years of staging exhibitions around the world, my husband said he thought it was about time we do something permanent in Milan,\u201d Miuccia Prada said on a recent afternoon, sipping tea in a conference room at her office near the new site, a spare space with just one artwork, Gerhard Richter\u2019s \u201cFive Doors,\u201d dramatically consuming an entire wall.A rendering of the sprawling new home of the Prada Foundation in Mlian, designed by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas. Scheduled to open on May 9, the facility is poised to become a major international arts destination.While the foundation has had modest galleries, this will be its first serious presence in Milan. The new site, a campus of buildings set around a courtyard, has more than twice the exhibition space of the galleries at the new Whitney Museum of American Art.While Milan may be a center for fashion and furniture design, it has not been known for contemporary art or the kind of inventive museum exhibitions that attract international audiences. With the city\u2019s cultural institutions battered by budget cuts, there is an opportunity to make an impact. \u201cThe new Prada Foundation is building on a tradition that began when the collector Giuseppe Panza created a contemporary art destination in a 17th-century villa in Varese just outside of Milan,\u201d said Emily Braun, an Italian art historian and curator. \u201cBut this is right in Milan; it\u2019s also interdisciplinary and a kind of patronage that seeks collaboration. Potentially it will fill the role of a contemporary art museum.\u201dThere will be a theater for films, live performances and lectures (Roman Polanski has created a documentary for the opening), an old-fashioned Milanese bar created by the director Wes Anderson, a center for children and eventually a large library. The foundation will be open to the public seven days a week, and general admission will be 10 euros (about $11). Prada S.p.A., which acts as a sponsor towards the foundation, has financed the entire complex itself, according to executives at the foundation. While\u00a0Mrs. Prada and her husband, Patrizio Bertelli, chief executive of the fashion brand, are not saying how much it cost, people familiar with the project believe it was considerably less expensive than the LVMH Foundation.Salvatore Settis, an Italian art historian and scholar who has organized companion exhibitions, one for the new foundation in Milan and the other for its Venice home, called the project \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing comparable in Italy,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis is something really avant-garde. To have a private foundation create a permanent institution that is open to the public is a major gesture, one that will have deep significance now and for future generations.\u201dSeven years in the making, the new art complex includes original industrial buildings juxtaposed with dramatic new ones.On a recent spring day, Mr. Koolhaas, in a hard hat and mud-covered sneakers, was surveying the construction. \u201cPeople talk about preservation, and they talk about new architecture,\u201d he said, standing in the middle of the courtyard pointing out the functions of each building. \u201cBut this is neither. Here new and old confront each other in a state of permanent interaction. They are not meant to be seen as one.\u201dThe original 1910 distillery \u2014 seven spaces including old warehouses and brewing silos \u2014 has retained its raw, industrial and often quirky qualities. Some of the spaces are as Mr. Koolhaas found them; others have been reconfigured but look as though they haven\u2019t been touched. The three new buildings are made of glass, white concrete and an aluminum that has been \u201cexploded,\u201d as Mr. Koolhaas described it, so that it has an airy, foamy surface. One is a large exhibition pavilion for temporary shows; another is a nine-story tower that will house long-term installations and a restaurant; the third building, the theater, has mirrored, stainless steel folding walls, allowing the space to open onto the courtyard for outdoor performances.Unlike the LVMH Foundation, the Prada Foundation will not be selling architect-designed handbags festooned with its label at its opening. Nor will it have the Prada logo on the foundation\u2019s facade. Mr. Bertelli and Mrs. Prada said they have kept their support of the arts separate from their brand and are not calling the new foundation headquarters a museum.As a private foundation in Italy, there are no tax benefits for the project, a spokesman for the foundation said.\u201cWe wanted to use the collection as an instrument for exploring ideas by many different voices,\u201d Mrs. Prada explained. Although the couple have collected art for more than two decades and are involved in every aspect of the foundation, they have put together a team of experts including Germano Celant, an independent curator, and Astrid Welter, who heads the foundation\u2019s curatorial team. Also contributing ideas is a group of scholars, historians and curators they call the Thought Counsel who keep them up-to-date on art happenings around the world.The foundation\u2019s inaugural program is ambitious. One of the exhibitions, \u201cSerial Classic,\u201d organized by Mr. Settis, will explore the notions of original and imitation, using Roman antiquities that are actually reproductions of lost Greek originals. Loans are coming from more than 40 museums, Mr. Settis said, including the Louvre in Paris, the Prado in Madrid, the British Museum in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In other galleries, just steps away from the first-century bronzes and marble busts, will be site-specific installations created by renowned contemporary artists.(\u201cPortable Classic,\u201d a companion show organized by Mr. Settis, opens on May 9 at the foundation in Venice. It will include about 90 miniature reproductions of classical sculptures made primarily from the 15th through the 17th centuries.)\u201cIn the last few years, I\u2019ve gotten very interested in antiquities and have been reading and studying about them,\u201d Mrs. Prada said. \u201cSo I thought it would be fantastic to open with exhibitions about ancient art both here and in Venice to show the influence they have had on so much art being produced today.\u201dAlso enthusiastic about film, dance, theater and literature, Mrs. Prada, clad in a simple navy blue dress and platform heels, exudes a boundless curiosity, amiably questioning a visitor about current exhibitions and emerging artists. She is known for making studio visits by herself. Damien Hirst, Thomas Demand and Robert Gober, artists who have worked with her for years, say she is sympathetic to the trials that go with their work, given her experience designing fashion.Recently, Mr. Bertelli and Mrs. Prada have not limited their buying to 20th- and 21st-century art. The foundation recently acquired a late-15th-century Northern Italian marquetry studiolo \u2014 or small paneled room \u2014 which will be shown in one of the new galleries.There will be echoes of ancient art on the facade of one of the old buildings, a four-story structure that Mr. Koolhaas calls the haunted house because it was so dilapidated when he first saw it. It now has a dreamy gold-leafed exterior, applied by artisans trained in the ancient technique of rubbing small squares of gold into a surface. The choice of gold, Mrs. Prada said, \u201cgives importance to something very modest\u201d and over time, it will take on a soft patina like an ancient sculpture.\u201cMilan is like a pancake with few high-rise elements,\u201d Mr. Koolhaas explained. \u201cThe environment is so gray it needed a little color.\u201d As the light changes throughout the day, he added, the gold will cast reflections on the surrounding buildings.The foundation showed the installation in Venice in 2007, and it is recreating it here. Mr. Demand painstakingly creates environments and then photographs them, in this case a grotto on the isle of Majorca. Not only will the monumental photograph be on view, but so will the entire process that went into its creation, including research materials and the enormous set of the grotto \u2014 a 36-ton cardboard model composed of 900,000 sections. Mrs. Prada had persuaded Mr. Demand to save every scrap including the model, a first, according to his dealer, Matthew Marks, as the artist normally destroys his sets.Also on view from the foundation\u2019s collection will be dozens of paintings, photographs, drawings, installations and sculptures organized by art historical moments that Mrs. Prada feels are relevant today. That includes American Minimalism, Conceptualism and Land Art, and work by Walter de Maria, Ed Kienholz, Bruce Nauman, Joseph Cornell and Pino Pascali. There are also younger figures like the Swedish sculptor and film animator Nathalie Djurberg.\u201cOne day I got a call out of the blue asking if Miuccia could come over,\u201d Mr. Gober recalled, sitting in his Chelsea studio the other day. That was in 2009, and she kept returning. Now a group of his sculptures will occupy three floors of the so-called haunted house. \u201cShe intuitively decided that I should be there along with Louise Bourgeois,\u201d Mr. Gober said, pleased to be paired with an artist whose work he has long admired.His installation includes a 2010 sculpture of a man\u2019s leg with an anchor attached as well as a new version of what appears to be a grate you\u2019d find on a city sidewalk. Visitors peering beneath its surface will discover a creek with running water and a red glass heart in the center of what looks like a bunch of sticks, stones, rocks and dead leaves. Every one of those seemingly natural objects, however, is an impeccably handcrafted sculpture.As the level of the running water was being tested in his studio, Mr. Gober discussed the new foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anything anyone has created before,\u201d he said, adding that its impact on Milan will be significant. \u201cBut then again working with Miuccia is different than working with most collectors. She\u2019s like dealing with another artist.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the Prada Foundation\u2019s new arts complex in Milan referred incorrectly to its financing. The corporation Prada S.p.A., which acts as a sponsor toward the Prada Foundation, has financed the entire complex itself. It was not financed personally by Miuccia Prada and her husband, Patrizio Bertelli, chief executive of the fashion brand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Land, Up for Grabs", "Date": "2015-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSan FRANCISCO \u2014 A BATTLE is looming over America\u2019s public lands. It\u2019s difficult to understand why, given decades of consistent, strong support from voters of both parties for protecting land, water and the thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic benefits these resources make possible.Last week, the United States Senate voted 51 to 49 to support an amendment to a nonbinding budget resolution to sell or give away all federal lands other than the national parks and monuments. If the measure is ever implemented, hundreds of millions of acres of national forests, rangelands, wildlife refuges, wilderness areas and historic sites will revert to the states or local governments or be auctioned off. These lands constitute much of what\u2019s left of the nation\u2019s natural and historical heritage. This was bad enough. But it followed a 228-to-119 vote in the House of Representatives approving another nonbinding resolution that said \u201cthe federal estate is far too large\u201d and voiced support for reducing it and \u201cgiving states and localities more control over the resources within their boundaries.\u201d Doing so, the resolution added, \u201cwill lead to increased resource production and allow states and localities to take advantage of the benefits of increased economic activity.\u201dThe measures, supported only by the Republicans who control both houses, were symbolic. But they laid down a marker that America\u2019s public lands, long held in trust by the government for its people, may soon be up for grabs.Nearly $17 billion has gone to those purposes over the years, including 41,000 state and local park and recreation projects, some of which my organization has helped put together. (Another $19 billion was diverted by Congress to other purposes.) The program expires Sept. 30 unless Congress keeps it alive.Land protection has long been an issue for which voters of both parties have found common cause. Since 1988, some $71.7 billion has been authorized to conserve land in more than 1,800 state and local elections in 43 states. Last year, $13.2 billion was approved by voters in 35 initiatives around the country \u2014 the most in a single year in the 27 years my organization has tracked these initiatives and, in some cases, led them.But this consensus is being ignored, and not just in the nation\u2019s capital.In November, for instance, 4.2 million Florida voters approved a state constitutional amendment to provide $22 billion over the next 20 years for land and water protection. But some legislative leaders want to use the money mostly for programs other than the land protections voters expected.New Jersey voters also approved a constitutional amendment in November to dedicate corporate business tax revenue to preserve open space, farmland and historic places in the nation\u2019s most densely populated state. Again, support was lopsided, with 65 percent of voters in favor. But Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, is now proposing to divert a quarter of the funds to purposes other than land acquisition and preservation.And in Maine, money approved by voters for a popular state program called Land for Maine\u2019s Future is now caught up in a political tussle. The program was founded in 1987 to conserve land and has protected 560,000 acres. It has enjoyed wide support; in 2012, new bond financing was approved by 60 percent of voters casting a ballot. But Gov. Paul R. LePage, a Republican, is refusing to spend about $11 million unless his plan to increase timber harvesting on state-owned lands is approved. What\u2019s often lost in these debates is that these public lands provide enormous economic benefits. In 2013, the country\u2019s national parks, wildlife refuges, monuments and other public lands had an estimated 407 million visits, which contributed $41 billion to the economy and helped to support 355,000 jobs, according to a report by the Department of the Interior last year. It is difficult to understand the hostility of some elected officials these days to public lands, given the historical, bipartisan commitment to protecting our land and heritage. This summer, millions of Americans will get outdoors and enjoy these wise investments. The writer Wallace Stegner saw \u201cgeographies of hope\u201d in our remaining wild places, and wrote that visiting them is \u201cgood for us when we are young, because of the incomparable sanity it can bring, as vacation, and rest, into our insane lives.\u201d And, he added, \u201cit is important to us when we are old because it is there \u2014 important, that is, simply as an idea.\u201dRather than selling off the lands we all own, or looking for other uses for the money approved at the ballot box for conservation, our leaders should listen to voters and find ways to protect more of the places that make America special.

{"Headline": "Hong Kong Presents Plan for Elections, Offering Little to Democrats", "Date": "2015-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Hong Kong entered a new bout of struggle over its political future on Wednesday, as the local government offered only minor changes to an election overhaul plan that set off months of pro-democracy demonstrations last year. Opposition lawmakers denounced the latest proposals, signaling the start of a political contest that will make or break the government\u2019s plans.\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to satisfy everyone in just one proposal,\u201d the chief secretary of the Hong Kong government, Carrie Lam, said in presenting the election plan to the city\u2019s Legislative Council, which will vote on whether to make it law.But as she spoke, about two dozen pro-democracy lawmakers walked out of the legislative chamber and condemned the proposal as a betrayal of Hong Kong\u2019s democratic hopes. \u201cThe government\u2019s proposal allows a small circle of people to control the nomination process, hence control the election outcome, turning the people into voting tools,\u201d one of them, Alan Leong, declared to Ms. Lam before he walked out.Protest groups and student leaders also scorned the plan as falling far short of the open democratic vote for the city\u2019s leader, or chief executive, that they have demanded as a legal and moral right. They vowed to renew the push for expanded voting rights that last year brought tens of thousands of people into Hong Kong\u2019s streets, in protests that blocked major thoroughfares for months.Hundreds of people gathered outside the Legislative Council building on Wednesday to denounce or support the election proposals, and scuffles broke out between the two sides.\u201cIf we accept fake democratic reform it is worse than no democratic reform,\u201d said Tam Tak-chi, a 43-year-old protester. \u201cIf we accept fake democratic reform, the Chinese Communist government and the Hong Kong Communist government will say, \u2018Oh, we give you true democracy, we gave you everything, don\u2019t ask for more.\u2019\u201dPro-government supporters, many of them older and waving Chinese national flags, countered with their own warnings. \u201cWe want a peaceful and stable Hong Kong, not chaos,\u201d said one, who gave only her surname, Wu.As announced last year, the government\u2019s proposed rules would give residents a direct vote for chief executive for the first time, starting in 2017, but only from among two or three candidates approved by a nomination panel dominated by people beholden to Beijing. That would effectively exclude candidates unacceptable to the Chinese government.In one modification, aspiring candidates would need the support of at least 120 members of the 1,200-person nomination committee; the panel would then choose two or three of those candidates to run in the general election. That 120-vote threshold is lower than under the current system, which involves an election committee dominated by pro-Beijing politicians and businessmen but no direct public vote.But there has been little serious study of broader potential compromises that might satisfy most voters, Mr. Young said. \u201cIt just seems like there\u2019s been zero fruitful discussion of issues, and if anything, the degree of distrust has gotten worse,\u201d he said.\u201cI can\u2019t see any room for compromise on the proposal,\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, who has firmly supported Chinese government policies toward the city, said Wednesday morning.Opposition groups have demanded that those lawmakers stay united behind their earlier vow to vote against the plan. A coalition of protest groups that supported the street occupations last year warned democratic lawmakers on Tuesday against accepting the government plan or holding secret negotiations over it.Mr. Young, the law professor, said after reading the government\u2019s proposal that the pro-democratic lawmakers were certain to reject it. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in here that would attract them to bite on a compromise,\u201d he said.But the Hong Kong government has said it will marshal public pressure to try to coax at least four of them to vote for the proposal, which would provide the two-thirds majority in the Legislative Council needed to pass it into law. That vote appears likely to happen before mid-July, when the council goes into recess.\u201cBut if we do support an undemocratic package, we\u2019d pay another cost,\u201d she said.Hong Kong, a former British colony, was returned to China in 1997, but the city has retained its own laws and protections, although mainland Chinese influence over the economy and the media has deepened.The demonstrations consolidated into street occupations in three busy neighborhoods, which as the weeks passed were festooned with posters and images of yellow umbrellas, the protesters\u2019 makeshift shield and a symbol of what some called the Umbrella Revolution.Protest leaders said public anger over the election plans was likely to build in the coming weeks, although many have conceded that any demonstrations are unlikely to reach the same high pitch as last year.\u201cIf some pan-democrats try to shift to supporting the government proposal, I believe there will be civil disobedience,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it will be street occupations or occupation of government buildings, we can\u2019t be sure yet.\u201dMichael Forsythe contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Turmoil Between Political Leaders Has Harmed Bangladesh\u2019s People", "Date": "2015-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGarment workers walking to their factories in Dhaka, Bangladesh. At 7:30 every morning, garment workers in jewel-colored head scarves fill the streets of this neighborhood in the Bangladeshi capital.This scene is replicated thousands of times a day in Bangladesh, where the garment industry is responsible for 80 percent of exports.DHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 The quickest way to grasp the nastiness of Bangladesh\u2019s season of political turmoil is to visit the high dependency unit at Dhaka Medical College Hospital.Mr. Mollah, 25, was the lucky one, having jumped out the passenger-side window so quickly that his worst injuries were fractures to bones and kneecaps. The eight men to his right were unlucky: five died, and others came out with seared tracheas, faces stripped of skin, eyelids swollen to slits. Asked what he would say to the country\u2019s political leaders, he spoke dully.\u201cThey are killing ordinary people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are killing their own brothers.\u201d There are few in Bangladesh who do not sound exhausted this spring. The country was thrust into disarray in January, when the opposition leader Khaleda Zia declared an indefinite campaign of strikes and transport blockades, hoping to pressure her rival, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, into holding new national elections. Yet if Mrs. Zia was expecting compromise, none came. Political tension relaxed in recent weeks, and life has largely returned to normal on Dhaka\u2019s streets, but there is no long-term solution in sight. Among those watching closely were the country\u2019s leaders of industry. A World Bank report released on Sunday showed that Bangladesh\u2019s economy lost $2.2 billion, or around 1 percent of gross domestic product, as a result of 62 days of political unrest this year. The report said the country\u2019s economic growth rate would be 5.6 percent this fiscal year \u2014 compared\u00a0with\u00a06.6 percent the bank had predicted before the strikes began. The violence can be traced to nationwide elections in January 2014, which set off a battle of wills between the two ladies.Mrs. Zia, a former prime minister whose Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or B.N.P., leads a 20-party opposition alliance, threatened to boycott the polls, suggesting that they would be rigged in the government\u2019s favor. Mrs. Hasina called her bluff and held an election that excluded the alliance, issuing vague promises of repeat elections in the coming months. This January, after a year of waiting, Mrs. Zia declared an indefinite protest campaign.More than 100 Bangladeshis have died, and many more have been horribly injured, in roadside bombings. By blocking highways, often violently, the protesters targeted the weakest link in the supply chain. The government has responded with increasingly harsh measures, and many of Mrs. Zia\u2019s party leaders either have been arrested or are in hiding. B.N.P. officials deny responsibility for the violence but say they had no option besides blockades and strikes.\u201cI saw the agonies of the burned people, their maimed bodies, the smell of burning flesh,\u201d acknowledged Mahbubur Rahman, a retired army general and member of the B.N.P.\u2019s national standing committee. \u201cBut what we say is that the government is not allowing us to talk. Not allowing us to assemble. Not allowing us to protest, to make our news. In this situation, where the democratic rights are denied, what else can we do?\u201dThe campaign hurt the entire country: students whose schools shut down before examinations; farmers who watched their crops rot; tourist resorts reporting near-total vacancy. But no sector matters as much as the garment industry, which accounts for 80 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s exports and faces stiff competition from factories in Cambodia and Vietnam.Shabbir Mahmood, who has two plants that employ 820 workers, felt the damage immediately.Of the four companies that regularly give him orders, two canceled their January buying visits out of security concerns. Orders for February and March fell to half the plants\u2019 capacity, leaving him no choice but to furlough workers. This made it all the more vital to guarantee prompt deliveries for his remaining buyers.Yet he did not have the heart to order terrified drivers to haul goods to the nearest port in Chittagong, a 160-mile journey that takes six hours under normal circumstances.\u201cThey came to me and said, \u2018Sir, how will we drive? How will we go across the road if they try throwing bombs?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Mahmood said, and he shrugged. \u201cI can give them money, but I cannot give them their lives back.\u201d In the end, he paid out of pocket to send two or three shipments by air.Mr. Mahmood has delayed the planned fall opening of a third factory, this one to employ 2,000 workers; if the strikes continue, he will delay again. Though manufacturers have lobbied both Mrs. Zia and Mrs. Hasina to pursue a negotiated settlement for the sake of the economy, he said, they have had no success.\u201cWho will care? The government will not care,\u201d Mr. Mahmood said. \u201cTextile people always tell them this, but they do not care.\u201dGovernment officials, and some economists, say the economy is resilient enough to weather moderate political strife, and note that the biggest garment businesses managed to move their cargo to port in a timely fashion through the worst violence, in January and February.Khurrum Siddique, director of Simco Dresses Ltd., a manufacturer based in a suburb north of Dhaka, described the political uncertainty as \u201ca disaster, a man-made disaster.\u201d He said his company was reconsidering plans for investment this year.\u201cWe have no ethnic, linguistic or sectarian problems in Bangladesh, especially compared to Pakistan or India,\u201d Mr. Siddique said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why this issue can\u2019t be solved over a cup of tea.\u201dFor garment workers, a large number of them women, the stakes are also high. In the Mirpur neighborhood of Dhaka, where workers sleep five to a rented room, many are already complaining of lost overtime, saying their workday now ends around 4 or 5 p.m. instead of 9 or 10. This is no small matter, since rent and food eat up nearly all of their base monthly pay of around 6,000 taka, or about $77. Ask what they would do if manufacturers began laying off workers, and the answer is sobering. Most were landless villagers, and workers said they would have few options beyond day labor for 50 taka, or about 65 cents, a day. Women in the villages rarely bring in income, so they are heavily reliant on their husbands, and many say they would not consider returning until they could open their own businesses.\u201cIf I go back to the village with empty hands, with no savings, it would be the worst thing in my life,\u201d said Momena Akhter, 30. One of her neighbors, Mahmuda Khatun, 55, said she had no doubt who would be to blame if the industry entered a downturn. \u201cThe government is responsible for all these things,\u201d Ms. Khatun said, a fist planted on her hip. \u201cI will tell them: You are responsible. I will blame them. I will say it is because of you that all of this is happening.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Skeptical of Iran Nuclear Deal, Israel Calls for Changes", "Date": "2015-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe list, produced by Yuval Steinitz, Israel\u2019s minister of intelligence and strategic affairs and one of the Israeli government\u2019s harshest critics of the negotiations, marked a change in direction for the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Until now, Israel has argued, at least publicly, that the only good deal would halt all uranium enrichment by Iran, essentially rolling back the clock by 20 years. It has never before defined the \u201cbetter deal\u201d that Mr. Netanyahu told Congress the world needed.But Mr. Steinitz\u2019s list of desired modifications for the final agreement, due to be concluded by June 30, appeared carefully designed to echo some of the more sophisticated critiques of the agreement that have circulated since the United States described critical elements of the deal on Thursday.Israeli policy makers have grappled for some time with the question of whether to stick, at least publicly, to Israel\u2019s maximalist demands, even though they appeared increasingly out of sync with the reality of a negotiation that clearly was going to require concessions on all sides.American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program.Before the details of the framework were made known, some Israeli officials feared that showing any flexibility might be interpreted as a green light by the Obama administration to engage in further give and take, precluding a more nuanced approach.Mr. Steinitz\u2019s tone was a bit different, saying the changes \u2014 including some restraints American negotiators had attempted unsuccessfully to obtain in past negotiations \u2014 would make the accord \u201cmore reasonable.\u201dBut the Obama administration fears that reopening the issues with Iran in the last stages of the talks would invite it to do the same, rapidly unraveling the deal.So far, the administration has shown no inclination to relitigate some of the most contentious issues that have been argued over for the last two years, culminating in eight days of intense negotiation at a hotel in Lausanne, Switzerland, on the banks of Lake Geneva. But Mr. Steinitz said that the suggestion that there was no alternative to the framework, or that Israel had not put forward an alternative, \u201cis wrong.\u201d\u201cThe alternative is not necessarily to declare war on Iran,\u201d he said, briefing international reporters at a Jerusalem hotel. \u201cIt is to increase pressure on Iran and stand firm and make Iran make serious concessions and have a much better deal.\u201dThe Lausanne framework calls on Iran to limit enrichment of uranium at its Natanz facility to a level useful only for civilian purposes, drastically cut its fuel stockpile and cut back the number of installed centrifuges by about two-thirds. It would convert the underground Fordo facility into a research center, but would be barred from enriching there. Iran would also modify its Arak heavy water reactor to drastically reduce its output of plutonium, another path to a bomb.In exchange, the United States and other nations would lift sanctions that have constrained the Iranian economy. President Obama said the sanctions would be lifted only after Iran had delivered on its commitments regarding Fordo, the centrifuges and other issues, although he said there were details still to be worked out.The Israeli list of additions to the framework includes the following:\u0095 An end to all research and development activity on advanced centrifuges in Iran. The Lausanne framework, as described by the United States, leaves unclear what kind of work Iran will conduct. But it is a worry to American and Israeli officials because Iran will be readying to deploy the much more efficient centrifuges as soon as the major limitations on uranium production end, in 2030.\u0095 A significant reduction in the number of centrifuges that are operational or that can quickly become operational if Iran breaks the agreement and decides to build a bomb. The accord allows about 5,000 to operate for the first decade at the main plant at Natanz, roughly half the number spinning today.\u0095 Iranian compliance in revealing its past activities with \u201cpossible military dimensions.\u201d It is unclear from the wording of the American statement if Iran must completely answer a dozen questions posed by the International Atomic Energy Agency \u2014 11 of which it has declined to answer so far \u2014 before it would receive full sanctions relief.\u0095 A commitment to ship its stockpile of enriched uranium out of Iran. Iran said last week that it would not ship the stockpile out of the country, but the American statement left open the possibility of sending it abroad or diluting it in Iran.\u0095 \u201cAnywhere, anytime\u201d access for inspectors charged with verifying the agreement in Iran. The inspection regime falls short of this, but sets up some kind of mechanism \u2014 the details of which are unclear \u2014 to resolve disputes if Iran blocks inspection of a suspected site.Despite Mr. Obama\u2019s more conciliatory tone toward Israel in recent days, Israel has made it clear that it intends to keep up the pressure. On Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d and NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d where he said: \u201cI\u2019m not trying to kill any deal. I\u2019m trying to kill a bad deal.\u201dYet Israel\u2019s former intelligence chiefs have been more welcoming. Efraim Halevy, a former head of Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence agency, suggested that those in Israel who have been critical of Mr. Obama should change their tone.Mr. Halevy told Israel\u2019s Army Radio on Monday that \u201cin order to influence you have to act with a certain kind of respect for your partner.\u201dAdel al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambassador in Washington, echoed the Saudi cabinet of ministers in expressing hope that the final deal in June would prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran.He would not say whether the agreement announced by the United States last week had gone far enough toward meeting that goal. \u201cI don\u2019t know because the details have not been worked out.\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a number of areas where, I think, more clarification needs to take place.\u201dOn Monday in Jerusalem, Mr. Steinitz, the minister of intelligence and strategic affairs, said Israel would be making further efforts to persuade the Obama administration and Congress, as well as Britain, France, Russia and other world powers, \u201cnot to sign this bad deal or at least to dramatically change or fix it.\u201dIt was unsatisfactory, Mr. Steinitz said, because of the time required to refer suspicions to a committee, and because no nation would want to expose sensitive intelligence data to a committee that included an Iranian presence.But Mr. Steinitz said the Israeli government had conducted a \u201csober analysis\u201d of the agreement and was raising questions, including why the framework does not address Iran\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile program, which it says threatens the United States. The negotiation has never included Iran\u2019s missile capability.As Mr. Steinitz was outlining his government\u2019s position, the White House said it was actively seeking out supporters of Israel in its intensive effort to build support for the agreement.\u201cThis is a deliberate attempt to make the case to individuals who are concerned about the security of Israel that going along with an agreement like this that would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon isn\u2019t just in the best national security interests of the United States, which it is, it\u2019s also clearly in the best interests of the nation of Israel,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. \u201cThat will be an important part of our case moving forward.\u201d Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and David E.

{"Headline": "Ukraine\u2019s Parliament Moves to Shore Up Battered Economy", "Date": "2015-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 In a blizzard of votes that highlighted Ukraine\u2019s struggles, past and present, the Parliament adopted legislation on Thursday to ban all symbols and \u201cpropaganda\u201d of Communism and Nazism and to overhaul the country\u2019s notoriously corrupt and mismanaged natural gas market. The legislature also passed measures on an array of financial, tax, regulatory and other provisions aimed at improving its nearly collapsed economy. The frenzy of legislative activity ahead of the Orthodox Easter holiday on Sunday occurred as new evidence emerged of just how badly Ukraine\u2019s business sector has been shattered in the year since mass protests ousted President Viktor F. Yanukovych, Russia annexed Crimea and pro-Russian separatists ignited a war in the industrial eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.Metinvest, a steel and mining conglomerate owned by Rinat Akhmetov, long reputed to be Ukraine\u2019s richest man, announced that it had defaulted on $113 million in debt and was in negotiations with other bondholders in a bid to defer future payments it cannot make. Metinvest also posted 2014 financial results showing an 18 percent drop in revenues. The company\u2019s chief executive, Yuri Ryzhenkov, noted in a statement that Metinvest had substantial assets in the war-torn east, but that Ukraine\u2019s overall economic woes also hurt the company. \u201cThe domestic political and economic situation, which began to deteriorate in late 2013, worsened significantly throughout 2014,\u201d Mr. Ryzhenkov said. \u201cUkraine is experiencing substantial ongoing turbulence.\u201d He added, \u201cAgainst this backdrop, the conflict in the eastern regions has led to severe disruption at some of our metallurgical and mining facilities.\u201d The new Ukrainian government has averted financial collapse thanks only to a huge bailout from the International Monetary Fund and other supporters. Many of the legislative provisions adopted Thursday are related to demands by creditors for sweeping economic and regulatory reforms, especially in the energy sector. Even with a shaky cease-fire mostly holding in the east, the tense political situation continues to overshadow everything, characterized by seething anti-Russian sentiment stemming from the Kremlin\u2019s support of the separatists. Acting partly on that anger, the Parliament, called the Verkhovna Rada, adopted a law that bans all Nazi and Communist symbols and \u201cpropaganda,\u201d including monuments for Communist figures and streets named for them. The move is a drastic step, given that many places in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, have streets named for Marx and Lenin, including in Kiev, the capital. According to the law, those streets would have to be renamed and any statues of Communist figures still standing (many were torn down during last year\u2019s protests) would have to be removed. The measure also bans Communist flags, including the Soviet hammer and sickle, and makes it illegal to deny the \u201ccriminal\u201d nature of the Communist and Nazi governments. Critics of the law said that regional and local officials should decide how streets are named or what monuments are erected. Even some supporters of the general concept of banning \u201ctotalitarian\u201d symbols expressed misgivings about the way the bill was rammed through Parliament less than a week after it was formally introduced. The measure still must be signed by President Petro O. Poroshenko to become law. In Russia, where a bit of a Soviet revival has been underway, especially as it relates to nostalgia for the Soviet Union\u2019s superpower status, the measure was greeted as yet another example of Kiev\u2019s anti-Russian posture. Russian officials and government-controlled news outlets have repeatedly asserted that Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s ouster was driven by neo-Nazi and other fascist groups in Ukraine and that those organizations dominate the new government in Kiev. So there was little surprise on Thursday when the Kremlin immediately condemned the Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s equation of Communism with Nazism. President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s chief spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Ukraine was disrespecting Russian war veterans before the 70th anniversary of their victory over Nazi Germany next month. \u201cRussia does and will preserve the memory of the war, and most importantly, it will remember the lessons this war taught the entire humankind,\u201d Mr. Peskov said, according to the Interfax news service. \u201cIt is regretful that against the backdrop of such decisions and such claims, very many veterans will find themselves with tears in their eyes in the weeks preceding the V-Day anniversary.\u201d Another major bill approved by the Ukrainian Parliament on Thursday provided for a sweeping overhaul of the natural gas market, with numerous provisions aimed at curtailing the dominance of the industry by business titans who have become fabulously wealthy, even as the state has hemorrhaged money on energy subsidies.Leaders of the Ukrainian national gas company, Naftogaz, hailed the bill, saying it would help bring Ukraine in line with international standards. \u201cThis law is an important step toward Ukraine\u2019s integration with the European Union,\u201d Andriy Kobolyev, the chief executive of Naftogaz, said in a statement. \u201cIt transparently opens our natural gas market to investors, stimulates competition and clearly outlines the functions of the state.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s Small Towns Feel the Cost of Europe\u2019s Migrant Crisis", "Date": "2015-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVORRA, Germany \u2014 Even as European officials struggle with an unrelenting tide of migrants trying to enter the Continent, tranquil villages like this one in a picture-book valley in northern Bavaria are coping with the legions who have already arrived.It is here, as much as on the choppy seas of the Mediterranean, that Europe\u2019s latest migration crisis is playing out.With the federal authorities expecting a flood of newcomers \u2014 an estimated 300,000 will apply for asylum in Germany this year, after 200,000 in 2014 \u2014 places like Vorra, population 1,000, are struggling to make room for those who are already here seeking legal status and integration. Housing has been designated, services have been mandated, and volunteers have offered clothing and services like rides and free language lessons.But along with hospitality, Germans are also showing hostility. In Vorra in December, and in the Saxon town of Tr\u00f6glitz over the Easter weekend, arsonists set fire to renovated shelters just weeks before migrants were to move in. No suspects have been detained in either case.And some community leaders ready to accept the new arrivals have faced ugly threats and protests from people who fear or loathe outsiders.Similar tensions, and even acts of violence, have emerged elsewhere in Europe \u2014 including in Sweden, where fires and vandalism were reported at mosques \u2014 amid anti-immigrant marches and heightened questions on everything from the worthiness of migrants to the soundness of immigration policies. The issue is feeding into nationalistic sentiments and politics.On Thursday, prompted by the deaths of more than 1,500 people who drowned at sea this year while trying to reach the Continent, European leaders will try to figure out a way to stanch the flow of refugees fleeing the disintegration of Syria and Libya, or from farther places like Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Mali. The meeting is expected to focus on the burdens the influx has placed on Italy, Greece, Spain and other parts of southern Europe.But in a quieter way, northern Europe has also been feeling the strain. On May 8, German leaders will hold their own talks in Berlin to address a growing plea from mayors across the country for money and assistance in carrying out the federal mandate for each of Germany\u2019s 16 states to take their share of migrants, and figure out how to make room for them.\u201cWealthy Germany can afford to help,\u201d said Volker Herzog, the mayor of Vorra. The local pastor, the Rev. Bj\u00f6rn Schukat, said that instead, there was a tendency among the authorities higher up the chain to simply announce that, for example, a dozen refugees are arriving \u2014 \u201cand now you get on with it.\u201dBehind the worries is a government policy that calls on the 82 million people of Europe\u2019s biggest economy to be generous, particularly in taking in tens of thousands of Syrians. The federal and state authorities apportion the quotas and, increasingly, pay to renovate or rent apartments before sending the people to localities.There is widespread understanding that Germany\u2019s Nazi past and current wealth impose a particular obligation to accommodate those fleeing hardship and war. But the costs are being felt as social workers grapple with overcrowded reception centers and officials scramble to house asylum seekers while applications grind through Germany\u2019s complex bureaucracy.The federal authorities have already loosened employment restrictions to allow new arrivals to work after three months if they can do so without violating varying rules that stipulate states or regions where they can reside.Accepting asylum seekers \u201cis a common concern for everyone in Germany,\u201d Horst Seehofer, leader of the Bavarian sister party in Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc, said this month. As governor of Bavaria, with its large rural areas, he emphasized, \u201cwe will not leave the communities alone to cope.\u201dBut this region, known as central Franconia, has three social workers for a current allocation of 1,000 migrants. It could use 10, said Pastor Schukat in Vorra.It was only last December that the federal authorities allocated an extra billion euros to the states and smaller communities to care for refugees this year and next. Just three weeks ago, Berlin was rebuffing calls for more. Now, more money is expected to flow from federal coffers after Ms. Merkel gathers with officials and politicians on May 8.In a recent German poll, more than half the respondents said they thought there was strong hostility to foreigners in the country.The concern that Germany is inhospitable was also expressed this winter in pro-immigration demonstrations held nationwide to counter swelling anti-immigration marches, above all in Dresden.The arson attacks in Vorra and Tr\u00f6glitz sent a signal that alarmed official Germany, ever conscious of the past.\u201cWe should not be surprised that our partners in the world note with great concern when refugee shelters burn in Germany, and that people follow exactly how German society is reacting,\u201d the foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, told Die Welt a week after the attack in Tr\u00f6glitz.There were about 17 times as many refugee deaths from January to April this year as there were during the same period last year.But just as European statements do little for the Italian Coast Guard members recovering bodies in the Mediterranean, pronouncements from Berlin may not help German mayors struggling with the refugee issue.In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Nierth said he was glad the federal authorities now seemed willing to do more, particularly financially. \u201cIt is really hard to make clear to some people that there is no money for a kindergarten or a swimming pool, but there is money to put up refugees,\u201d he said. If the state or federal government absorbed the cost, hostility to refugees would diminish, he said.In Vorra, Mr. Herzog, 52, a Social Democrat in a largely conservative state, has been mayor since 1996. He has spent his life in this valley and is still rattled by the night of Dec. 12, when his panicked deputy called to report that the new refugee shelter was on fire.Daylight revealed the extent of the damage, estimated at \u20ac700,000, and two swastikas daubed in red alongside a slogan, \u201cNo to asylum seekers in Vorra.\u201d\u201cI was speechless,\u201d Mr. Herzog said. \u201cWhat was really so bad was that only two weeks earlier, there had been an open day\u201d where everyone \u201cseemed really happy that a bit of life would return\u201d to a long-closed guesthouse that was renovated for about 40 refugees.\u201cFrom one night to the next morning,\u201d he sighed, showing a visitor the damage, \u201ceverything was destroyed.\u201dVorra is a meticulous place: Lace curtains hang the same length to the millimeter, logs are stacked in orderly piles and the church graveyard is strikingly well maintained. The community is small, and any outsider is instantly recognized as such.But on a recent afternoon, Helga Herbst, 53, and her husband, Peter, 61, were among several residents who said that asylum seekers would be welcome.\u201cThere has always been a good deal of contact with nonresidents, and no fear of such contact,\u201d Mr. Herzog said. Despite the swastikas, he was reluctant to attribute the arson attack to rightists. \u201cAnyone can paint a symbol on a wall,\u201d he said.Repairs are underway, though it will be fall at the earliest before about 30 refugees can be received.Pastor Schukat noted that adjoining villages had already absorbed a few dozen refugees, just as villages near Tr\u00f6glitz had.Asked whether the higher authorities were leaving small communities to cope as they can, Pastor Schukat was cautious. \u201cYes and no,\u201d he said. \u201cThe great advantage we have is that it really is possible to integrate these people. In a big city, if there are 100 new arrivals, it doesn\u2019t really hit home in a big way. Here, you really notice if you have 30 more people to deal with.\u201d In the best-case scenario, he said, everyone integrates \u201cin a good, lasting and reasonable way.\u201dCoping with change brought on by once-remote global crises has encouraged inhabitants to overcome fears of strangers, the pastor insisted. \u201cVorra is an absolutely normal village,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 100,000 like it in Germany.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Strikes in Argentina Bring Transportation to Standstill", "Date": "2015-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAirline, railroad and bus services were canceled and banks and filling stations across the country were closed by the strikes, leaving eerily empty the main avenues of cities and major transportation terminals.Union leaders called the one-day strike to demand that the government adjust income-tax rules to take account of the high inflation in the country \u2014 24 percent last year by official figures, and much more by private estimates. Until now, only a small minority of Argentines have had incomes high enough to owe any tax, but inflation and accompanying wage increases threaten to push many more workers above the minimum threshold, union leaders say.Strikes by influential unions are not uncommon in Argentina, but the timing and scale of the action on Tuesday may compound the political turbulence in the country, which is due to hold presidential primary elections in August.A prosecutor in Argentina accuses the president of attempting to cover up a secret deal to shield terrorists. Days later, the prosecutor is found dead and the president alleges a conspiracy. An overview of key developments in the case.The government has been in crisis since January, when a federal prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, died under murky circumstances after accusing President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner of plotting a political cover-up involving Iran and the bombing of a Jewish community center. A court has twice thrown out the case against Mrs. Kirchner, most recently last week, but an appeal of that decision was lodged on Tuesday.\u201cWe\u2019re enduring a very politicized scenario,\u201d Carlos Germano, an Argentine political analyst, said Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to end here.\u201dUnion leaders assailed the government\u2019s handling of economic and social issues and threatened additional action. \u201cWe propose continuing this struggle,\u201d Luis Barrionuevo, one of the leaders, said at a news conference Tuesday.Mrs. Kirchner, who is barred by the Constitution from running for re-election this year, appears to have weathered the fallout from Mr. Nisman\u2019s death, judging by the latest opinion polls. Surveys conducted by Management & Fit, an Argentine polling company, found that Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s job approval rating had risen to 36 percent from 30 in February. Axel Kicillof, the economy minister, suggested to reporters before the strike began that it was a strictly political maneuver that would benefit only a handful of Argentines \u2014 he put the figure at 10 percent \u2014 who pay income tax. \u201cSo this strike action is by the rest of the workers in solidarity with the biggest earners,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to explain its true purpose.\u201dIn a speech on Tuesday evening, Mrs. Kirchner lashed out at the workers and accused them of politicking.Moving to take advantage of the unrest, Sergio Massa, an opposition presidential candidate, promised on Tuesday that if he won the election, working-class people would immediately be exempt from income taxes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greece on the Brink", "Date": "2015-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cDon\u2019t you think they want us to fail?\u201d That\u2019s the question I kept hearing during a brief but intense visit to Athens. My answer was that there is no \u201cthey\u201d \u2014 that Greece does not, in fact, face a solid bloc of implacable creditors who would rather see default and exit from the euro than let a leftist government succeed, that there\u2019s more good will on the other side of the table than many Greeks suppose.But you can understand why Greeks see things that way. And I came away from the visit fearing that Greece and Europe may suffer a terrible accident, an unnecessary rupture that will cast long shadows over the future.The story so far: At the end of 2009 Greece faced a crisis driven by two factors: High debt, and inflated costs and prices that left the country uncompetitive.These immense sacrifices were supposed to produce recovery. Instead, the destruction of purchasing power deepened the slump, creating Great Depression-level suffering and a huge humanitarian crisis. On Saturday I visited a shelter for the homeless, and was told heartbreaking tales of a health care system in collapse: patients turned away from hospitals because they couldn\u2019t pay the 5 euro entrance fee, sent away without needed medicine because cash-starved clinics had run out, and more.Yes, it can. The irony of Syriza\u2019s victory is that it came just at the point when a workable compromise should be possible. The key point is that exiting the euro would be extremely costly and disruptive in Greece, and would pose huge political and financial risks for the rest of Europe. It\u2019s therefore something to be avoided if there\u2019s a halfway decent alternative. And there is, or should be.By late 2014 Greece had managed to eke out a small \u201cprimary\u201d budget surplus, with tax receipts exceeding spending, excluding interest payments. That\u2019s all that creditors can reasonably demand, since you can\u2019t keep squeezing blood from a stone. Meanwhile, all those wage cuts have made Greece competitive on world markets \u2014 or would make it competitive if some stability can be restored. The shape of a deal is therefore clear: basically, a standstill on further austerity, with Greece agreeing to make significant but not ever-growing payments to its creditors. Such a deal would set the stage for economic recovery, perhaps slow at the start, but finally offering some hope. But right now that deal doesn\u2019t seem to be coming together. Maybe it\u2019s true, as the creditors say, that the new Greek government is hard to deal with. But what do you expect when parties that have no previous experience in governing take over from a discredited establishment? More important, the creditors are demanding things \u2014 big cuts in pensions and public employment \u2014 that a newly elected government of the left simply can\u2019t agree to, as opposed to reforms like an improvement in tax enforcement that it can. And the Greeks, as I suggested, are all too ready to see these demands as part of an effort either to bring down their government or to make their country into an example of what will happen to other debtor countries if they balk at harsh austerity.To make things even worse, political uncertainty is hurting tax receipts, probably causing that hard-earned primary surplus to evaporate. The sensible thing, surely, is to show some patience on that front: if and when a deal is reached, uncertainty will subside and the budget should improve again. But in the pervasive atmosphere of distrust, patience is in short supply.It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. True, avoiding a full-blown crisis would require that creditors advance a significant amount of cash, albeit cash that would immediately be recycled into debt payments. But consider the alternative. The last thing Europe needs is for fraying tempers to bring on yet another catastrophe, this one completely gratuitous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone Economy Grows for 22nd Straight Month, Report Shows", "Date": "2015-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The eurozone economy expanded for a 22nd consecutive month in April, a private sector report showed on Thursday, but the modest pace of growth disappointed some analysts looking for more vigor resulting from the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying program.The market consensus had been for a small increase in the index. The lackluster report might reflect concerns about the economic crisis in Greece, though the figure was still close to an 11-month high, said Jessica Hinds, an economist in London with Capital Economics. She added that the April index level appeared consistent with quarterly economic growth of about 0.4 percent, or about 1.6 percent on an annualized basis.Markit said the survey showed growth beyond France and Germany, the region\u2019s two biggest economies, at the fastest pace since August 2007. The data showed Germany slowing slightly from what remains a relatively good pace and France still just above stagnation levels.The eurozone bottomed out in early 2013, but it has grown since then at a pace far too low to remove the slack from the economy. The jobless rate in the region stands at 11.3 percent, dragging on household spending and leaving businesses loath to invest. Complicating matters, Europe, like the United States and Japan, is suffering from historically low inflation, raising concern that the opposite phenomenon, deflation, will take hold.The European Central Bank is seeking to stimulate the region\u2019s economy through its quantitative easing policy, under which it has committed to buying up to 60 billion euros, or about $64 billion, of bonds each month through September 2016.The program has contributed to the optimism in some quarters by helping to push down the euro against the dollar, raising the competitiveness of European exporters against their foreign counterparts. Low oil prices have delivered what is in effect a stimulus to consumers.Still, Mr. Praet warned that what is now occurring is \u201cthe beginnings of a cyclical recovery.\u201dHe added, \u201cBut it is not yet a structural one.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A British Tax Break in Need of Fine-Tuning", "Date": "2015-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyBritain\u2019s so called non-dom system gives some rich people what appears to be an unfair tax break. If they count as being \u201cdomiciled\u201d abroad, they can pay the British authorities tax on income generated only in the country, even if they live there permanently. Other British residents have to pay tax on their global incomes.The opposition Labour Party, which could be in power after the May 7 general election, has seized on this anomaly and said it would abolish the non-dom status. It says it thinks this move would raise hundreds of millions of pounds in extra tax.The Labour politicians are onto something. But the fairness case is not quite as crystal clear as Ed Miliband, the party\u2019s leader, makes out. There is also a risk that abolishing the non-dom status could drive some people who benefit the economy out of Britain. Fortunately, there is a middle ground that would tackle unfairness but not throw the baby out with the bath water.First, though, some explanation about the meaning of this tax status. Being born abroad is normally enough to make a person qualify as a non-dom. If you are born in Britain to a father (but not a mother) who is himself a non-dom, that will also usually do. It may also be possible to be born in Britain, spend time abroad and then return to Britain and be classified as a non-dom \u2014 provided you can argue persuasively that your real home is elsewhere.The main tax break non-doms get is the ability to pay Britain tax on their Britain-generated income only \u2014 plus any income brought into the country. If they have lots of foreign income, this can be an attractive perk.There are 47,000 non-doms who have elected to take advantage of this privilege. If they have been living in Britain for less than seven years, as nearly 90 percent of them have, they do not pay for doing so. But about 5,000 have lived there longer. These pay an annual fee starting at 30,000 pounds, or about $44,000, and rising to \u00a390,000 if they have been residents for 17 years or more.Now look at the issue of fairness. It is hard to see why people who are born in Britain and living there should be able to avoid tax on their foreign income. The idea of inheriting non-dom status from one\u2019s father is nonsense. It also seems unfair for people who have moved to Britain and have been living there for a long time, say more than 10 years, to enjoy these perks.But what about those who go to Britain for only a short time? It does not seem fair to tax these people on their global income.The Labour Party has said there would be an exception for people in Britain on a temporary basis. It would consult on the details of what exactly should count as temporary but has suggested a maximum of two or three years.This seems reasonable. But what about those in the middle ground \u2014 those who have been living in Britain from three to 10 years?The fairness case for taxing this group is not clear. They are somewhere in between temporary and permanent residents. The risk of removing their non-dom status is that some would leave and others who might be attracted to Britain might not bother coming in the first place.Some Britons might say this would be no bad thing. They criticize rich non-doms for pushing up housing prices in central London and flashing their cash ostentatiously.While there is some validity in these criticisms, non-doms also bring benefits. They generate nearly \u00a39 billion in taxes. What is more, the money they spend in Britain \u2014 and some are really big spenders \u2014 generates employment and more tax.Labour thinks abolishing the non-dom status would raise money because such people would have to pay tax on their foreign income too. But if some of the richest quit the country, the measure could actually cost money. Among people who have lived in Britain more than a decade, not many will leave, because their roots will be deep. But those in the three-to-10-year range could be vulnerable. It would therefore be sensible to offer them some intermediate deal.One option could be to allow this group to continue to avoid tax on their foreign incomes provided they pay a fee that varies with the value of their British residences, say 1 percent each year, with a minimum of \u00a330,000. Such a charge would raise more money than the current fee \u2014 both because it would, for the first time, hit people who had been living in Britain for less than seven years and because really rich non-doms would pay much more than they currently do. An oligarch with a \u00a3100 million residence, whether he owned it or not, would pay \u00a31 million.But such a system would not drive people away. After all, for an oligarch, \u00a31 million a year is peanuts.If Labour wins the election, it should modify its plans in this way. If the governing Conservative Party hangs onto power, it should adopt such a policy too. Advertisement"}

Tannenbaum, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company. \u201cThe bad news is we\u2019re losing some jobs. The good news is, we hope, that the average consumer is saving a tremendous amount of money in lower gasoline prices.\u201dThe unemployment rate held steady at 5.5 percent. Hourly wages, in one of the few bright spots in the report, rose 0.3 percent for private sector workers in March, after a meager 0.1 percent rise in February. But hours worked were down slightly, so overall paychecks were left essentially flat.The slowdown in job creation reinvigorated the debate about when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates above their near-zero level, where they have remained since 2008. Many Wall Street analysts said the murky jobs picture was likely to reinforce the view among the Fed\u2019s more dovish policy makers that rates should stay put at least until the end of the summer because the economy may not be strong enough to stand on its own.\u201cFor Yellen, this is an affirmation of what she did,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. \u201cShe said she wants to see more improvement in the labor market.\u201dLuke A. Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors, said: \u201cFor the Fed, this report decreases the probability of an interest-rate increase at the June meeting.\u201d Rates for government bonds dipped slightly in limited holiday trading.In addition to the March numbers, government statisticians revised their previous estimates for January and February, subtracting 69,000 jobs from the earlier figures, leaving the monthly average for the first quarter at just under 200,000.\u201cIt was lower than expectations, without a doubt,\u201d said Thomas E. Perez, the secretary of labor. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always said that one month never makes a trend.\u201dMr. Perez said that if someone told him last year, when the unemployment rate was 6.6 percent, that it would now be at 5.5 percent, \u201cI would have said that\u2019s an April Fool\u2019s joke.\u201dMillions of Americans who have been too discouraged to look for work because of weakness in the labor market largely remained on the sidelines. The labor participation rate \u2014 which includes those who have jobs and those who are hunting \u2014 ticked down only slightly, to 62.7 percent from 62.8 percent in February.With several presidential hopefuls poised to announce their campaigns this month, this latest report will probably help set the stage for the economic themes that candidates present to voters. Republicans and Democrats, who have repeatedly underscored their interest in helping working- and middle-class families that the recovery has left behind, may be looking at other worrisome economic signs as well. Durable goods orders declined in February while retail sales were weak despite increases in household disposable income. The trade deficit narrowed in February \u2014 probably in part because of work stoppages at West Coast ports that limited imports \u2014 but the rising value of the dollar has put a dent in the country\u2019s exports and is likely to mean an increase in cheaper imports from overseas.Growth in manufacturing is also off to a slower start this year than some economists had hoped.Friday\u2019s disappointing figures, the weakest showing in two years, mean it will take longer for the economy to reach a level most analysts consider close to full employment.Housing prices have also continued their slow but steady recovery.Particular groups of workers continue to face persistent difficulties, however.\u201cThe unemployment rate for black communities is at a crisis level, even as the economy gets closer and closer to a full recovery,\u201d said Valerie Wilson, an economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.The unemployment rate for blacks is typically twice as high as the rate for whites, she said, but since the recession, that gap has increased. While white unemployment dropped to 4.5 percent in the last quarter of 2014, for example, black unemployment remained at 11 percent. Long-term unemployment also remains a problem for older workers even as more seniors are hanging on to their jobs well into their 60s. A report issued by the AARP Policy Institute this week noted that last year, on average, 45 percent of job seekers aged 55 and older were out of work for 27 weeks or more.The number of long-term unemployed was little changed at 2.6 million in March.Nonetheless, Mr. Tilley of Wilmington Trust remained optimistic: \u201cAlthough disappointing, we don\u2019t think it portends a turnaround for the U.S. economy.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the labor participation rate.

But as farmers tuned up their tractors and waited for the perfect moment to plant, another topic weighed on their minds: a lawsuit filed in federal court by the state\u2019s largest water utility.\u201cIt\u2019s very clear to me that traditional, industrial agriculture has no real interest in taking the steps that are necessary to radically change their operations in a way that will protect our drinking water,\u201d said Bill Stowe, the chief executive of Des Moines Water Works. High nitrate runoff, which can result from nitrogen-rich soil and applied fertilizer, places Des Moines\u2019s drinking water in danger of violating federal quality standards, Mr. Stowe said, and increases costs and poses health risks for customers. The lawsuit raises not only the legal question of whether the government should regulate the water that drains off farmers\u2019 land, but also the existential issue of whether rural and urban Iowans can collaborate to solve vexing problems. In a state where agriculture drives the economy, grain silos are featured on license plates and people pride themselves on a certain brand of \u201cIowa nice,\u201d farmers like Brent Johnson have criticized the litigation as an antagonistic overreach that comes at the expense of cooperation and neighborliness.\u201cIt\u2019s a confrontational approach,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, who farms corn and soybeans here in Calhoun County, one of three counties whose boards of supervisors were named as defendants in the lawsuit. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a lot of progress made. I don\u2019t know any farmer who wants to increase nitrates in the river.\u201dThe nitrate issue is, in many ways, an unfortunate side effect of one of Iowa\u2019s great assets: the nutrient-rich dirt that makes for some of the world\u2019s most productive cropland. Though that nitrogen-filled soil helps Mr. Johnson and others grow prodigious amounts of corn and soybeans, a significant rainstorm can wash many of those nutrients, along with nitrates applied as fertilizer, into tributaries of the Raccoon River. The Raccoon is one of two rivers that provide drinking water for Des Moines, the state\u2019s capital and urban center.Notably, most everyone involved agrees that the nitrates in the water supply are a problem, and that farmers can play a role in solving it. But while Mr. Stowe and the utility want to hold farmers to strict federal water quality standards, Mr. Johnson and the state\u2019s powerful agricultural groups favor a voluntary system. Leaders of other agricultural associations expressed similar sentiments, while saying they still appreciated the urgency of the problem. \u201cWe need to scale it up,\u201d said Roger Wolf, director of environmental programs and services for the Iowa Soybean Association. \u201cWe know that.\u201dMr. Johnson, whose family has worked these fields for more than 100 years, says he and his neighbors care deeply about the land and understand the concerns raised in the lawsuit. On his property, Mr. Johnson uses a limited-tilling method, and he has planted rows of switch grass on the edge of one field and has filled wetlands with native grasses. Experts say those tactics can help keep nutrients in the field and out of the water system. Mr. Johnson, who serves on the county soil and water conservation commission, made those changes on his own. He said he feared that the lawsuit, if successful, would add a regulatory burden just as many farmers were making voluntary changes. \u201cThat\u2019s not healthy for agriculture, I don\u2019t think, to take the voluntary out,\u201d he said. In Des Moines, Mr. Stowe said years of encouraging changes through voluntary programs had simply not brought about significant results. Nitrate levels in the Raccoon River remain stubbornly high, which required the utility to run its nitrate removal facilities for three months last winter, a rarity. In 2013, he said, Des Moines was barely able to remove nitrates quickly enough to keep up with demand, and nearly violated federal regulations. Just last Thursday, the utility turned its nitrate removal tanks back on, citing high levels of runoff upstream.However the issue is addressed, there are costs. Mr. Johnson\u2019s conservation practices required taking land out of production, potentially reducing profits at harvest time. For Des Moines Water Works, operating the tanks that remove nitrates is expensive. The lawsuit, filed in federal court for\u00a0the Northern District of Iowa, names the boards of supervisors in Buena Vista and Sac Counties, along with the board in Calhoun County, as defendants, saying they are responsible for overseeing drainage districts that have allowed nitrate-heavy water to make its way into rivers. Individual farmers\u2019 efforts and anecdotal reports of success, Mr. Stowe said, have not been enough to counter others\u2019 reluctance to make major changes. At this point, he said, collaboration with agricultural groups would have to come in addition to regulation, not instead of it.\u201cTalking the game and walking the game were two very different issues,\u201d Mr. Stowe said. \u201cThis is not \u2018Alice in Wonderland.\u2019 This is Iowa. Our water\u2019s getting worse, and we\u2019re going to fight forward to protect it.\u201dIowa\u2019s elected agriculture secretary, Bill Northey, has also criticized the lawsuit, though with less pointed language. Mr. Northey, a Republican who farms corn and soybeans, said the effects of the lawsuit could resound far beyond the three counties named as defendants if the water utility succeeded. The state has recently invested in programs to limit nitrate runoff, he said, and more time should be allowed for those programs to work.Several farmers agreed, and many said they had seen significant progress in just the past few years. On his farm in Greene County, in central Iowa, David Ausberger planted cover crops last fall, which can help keep dirt in place between the harvest and planting seasons. In Ida and Sac Counties, Jolene Riessen said her family was reducing tilling and using other methods to limit runoff.\u201cFarmers want to do the right thing,\u201d said Ms. Riessen, a farmer and seed dealer. \u201cBut sometimes, it\u2019s learning what is the right thing, or the combination of right things, and having the finances to do it.\u201dIn the meantime, as planting season begins, farmers say they are discussing the lawsuit, figuring out what it could mean for them and bracing for a contentious court battle that could last years.\u201cSome guys are mad; some guys are sad,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s concerned.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The company earns most of its revenue from subscriptions to its premium services and advertising on its site, generating $2.2 billion in sales last year.But the company has labored to become more than just an online repository for r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and job histories. For instance, in 2012, LinkedIn began soliciting influential business personalities like Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, to write original content for the site.The company hired Dan Roth, a former editor at Fortune magazine, to be LinkedIn\u2019s executive editor. Last year, the company introduced blogging capabilities for LinkedIn\u2019s users, essentially becoming an original content platform.And two years ago, the company bought Pulse, the maker of a newsreader app, for $90 million.LinkedIn binds all those services into what it calls the economic graph, where users can connect to both new professional opportunities and the skills needed to take advantage of them.But e-learning and professional development services is an entirely new category for the company, and LinkedIn hopes it will be another way it can lure users back to using its site every week or even every day.Lynda.com was started two decades ago as a small online portal for students to learn web design skills. It was founded by the husband-and-wife team of Lynda Weinman and Bruce Heavin, themselves graphic design experts who have both held positions at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif.Today, Lynda.com focuses on a number of subjects, like management skills, programming and video. It sells subscriptions that start at $25 a month.The company collected more than $150 million in revenue last year and has turned a profit since 1997.In January, the company raised $186 million in new financing, the biggest investment round by an education technology company in six years, according to CB Insights.He added, \u201cBoth companies believe strongly that the growing skills gap is one of the biggest challenges to the future of the global economy.\u201dIn a research note, Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, described the transaction as a strategic fit for LinkedIn.Under the terms of the deal, about 52 percent of LinkedIn\u2019s offer for Lynda.com will be in cash and the remainder in newly issued stock. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter.Michael J. de la Merced reported from San Francisco, and Mike Isaac from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "President Obama Calls Preliminary Iran\u00a0Nuclear Deal \u2018Our Best Bet\u2019", "Date": "2015-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the interview, held Saturday, Mr. Obama provided new details about how international inspectors would try to access suspected covert nuclear sites and about the sequence that would lead to sanctions being lifted. Both were major issues in the last days of negotiations in Switzerland, and Mr. Obama\u2019s descriptions differed in key respects from Iran\u2019s interpretations.That gap suggested the hardest moments in the negotiations may yet be ahead, given that commitments made last week must still be enshrined in a written document signed by all parties by June 30. But Mr. Obama seemed to gain breathing space as Republicans signaled they would give him until then to see what the final deal looks like before directly intervening.While in theory preventing Iran from being able to quickly build a bomb, the agreement leaves it with a nuclear program in place, even if much diminished, drawing criticism from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Republican leaders in Congress as well as skepticism from Arab allies and many Democrats.\u201cNot a single centrifuge is destroyed,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said Sunday on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on CNN. \u201cNot a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that they build illicitly. Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium. That\u2019s a very bad deal.\u201dSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a possible Republican presidential candidate, said it was \u201cprobably the best deal that Barack Obama could get with the Iranians because the Iranians don\u2019t fear\u201d him. \u201cHillary Clinton could do better,\u201d he added, as could all the Republican candidates, \u201cexcept maybe Rand Paul.\u201d But Mr. Graham said he would wait to see how the final agreement looked. \u201cI don\u2019t mind giving the administration the time between now and June to put this deal together,\u201d he said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.He pledged to redouble support for Israeli security. \u201cI would consider it a failure on my part, a fundamental failure of my presidency, if on my watch, or as a consequence of work that I had done, Israel was rendered more vulnerable,\u201d he said. Similarly, he said he wanted to use a meeting he has called at Camp David to \u201cformalize\u201d security aid for Arab allies threatened by Iran.While still resisting what he deemed congressional interference, Mr. Obama reached out to Republicans, calling Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, a \u201cgood and decent man.\u201d He did not embrace Mr. Corker\u2019s legislation to give Congress the right to approve or reject the deal. But when asked about a nonbinding vote, the president appeared supportive.\u201cMy hope is that we can find something that allows Congress to express itself but does not encroach on traditional presidential prerogatives and ensures that if in fact we get a good deal that we can go ahead and implement it,\u201d Mr. Obama said.Mr. Corker, appearing on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d immediately rejected the idea of a nonbinding vote. \u201cThere is strong bipartisan support for a binding vote by Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, the president needs to sell this to the American people, and Congress needs to be involved in this way.\u201dUnder the agreement, Iran would limit enrichment of uranium at its Natanz facility to a level useful only for civilian purposes; cut back the number of installed centrifuges by approximately two-thirds; convert its Fordo deep-underground enrichment facility into a research center; and modify its Arak heavy-water reactor to render it incapable of producing plutonium for a bomb.But the structure of international inspections was left vague, as was the timing for lifting sanctions.Mr. Obama said that inspectors would be able to watch \u201cthe entire nuclear chain\u201d and that a \u201cprocurement committee\u201d would examine Iranian imports to be sure equipment would be appropriate for peaceful nuclear uses, not a weapon. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, he said, \u201ccan go anyplace.\u201dBut the administration has been vague about how to define \u201canyplace,\u201d and Iran has said it would not be required to allow inspections of military bases.\u201cIran could object,\u201d Mr. Obama acknowledged, \u201cbut what we have done is to try to design a mechanism whereby once those objections are heard, that is not a final veto that Iran has but in fact some sort of international mechanism will be in place that makes a fair assessment.\u201dMr. Obama said sanctions would be lifted only after Iran lived up to its commitments. \u201cThere are still details to be worked out,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think that the basic framework calls for Iran to take the steps that it needs to around Fordo, the centrifuges and so forth. At that point, then the U.N. sanctions are suspended.\u201dA guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran.He said the United States would \u201cpreserve the ability to snap back those sanctions if there is a violation.\u201d And he added that separate sanctions imposed for other reasons, namely Iran\u2019s sponsorship of terrorists and its ballistic missile program, would remain in place.Administration officials said they envisioned Iran being able to take the required steps within months or a year of an agreement, at which point nuclear-related economic sanctions would be removed. But a major sticking point in the coming months will be the issue of additional sanctions imposed for other reasons.Mr. Obama said almost nothing about how the United States and its allies would force Iran to answer questions about suspected past work on weapons designs. For years, Iran has blocked inspectors from visiting laboratories where such work is believed to have been conducted.Mr. Obama presented the nuclear agreement in broader terms. He admitted that he remained uncertain about the intentions of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, with whom he has exchanged letters. \u201cHe\u2019s a pretty tough read,\u201d Mr. Obama said. The ayatollah\u2019s letters, he said, are filled with \u201ca lot of reminders of what he perceives as past grievances against Iran.\u201dBut Mr. Obama said it was telling that the ayatollah allowed his negotiators to make concessions, and he held out hope that the agreement would empower more moderate figures, although he said he was not counting on it.\u201cWho knows?\u201d he added. \u201cIran may change.\u201d But if not, he said, the United States retains \u201cthe most firepower\u201d to address any contingencies.\u201cIt\u2019s not as if in all these conversations, I\u2019m leaving all my, you know, rifles at the door,\u201d he said.Asked about an Obama Doctrine, he said: \u201cThe doctrine is we will engage, but we preserve all our capabilities. And I\u2019ve been very clear that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon on my watch, and I think they should understand that we mean it. But I say that hoping that we can conclude this diplomatic arrangement and that it ushers in a new era in U.S.-Iranian relations.\u201dDavid E. Sanger contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Deal May Be Slow to Affect Oil Sector", "Date": "2015-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe lifting of oil sanctions has been one of Iran\u2019s main objectives because its economy is highly dependent on oil sales, and sanctions have caused cancellations and delays in oil exploration and production projects.\u201cThe framework agreement lays out a path to significantly increase Iranian oil exports over time,\u201d said Michael Levi, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. But he added, \u201cYou want to know how many barrels will come out of Iran next week? Zero.\u201dThe agreement does not detail which of an intricate web of financial, oil and travel sanctions will be removed first and in what order they will be lifted. And before Iran can begin to significantly add to world supplies, the United States and its allies will need to be convinced that Tehran is living up to its commitments under the tentative agreement.Verification could be a time-consuming process, energy experts say, since modifying nuclear equipment, dismantling centrifuges and carrying out detailed inspections can take months.And even after verification, production and exports will take more than a year to recover because the output of Iran\u2019s fields have been declining in recent years because of underinvestment and western sanctions.Energy analysts at Raymond James said it was unlikely Iran could realistically increase production by more than an additional half a million barrels a day by the end of 2016.\u201cLet\u2019s not ignore the technical issues here,\u201d said a Raymond James report this week. \u201cOnce a well is shut in, resuming production is not quite flipping a switch. It is almost always the case that the subsequent rate of production ends up being below what the well was producing before.\u201dIran is still among the premier oil producers in the world, and has the fourth-largest proven reserves after Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Canada. Its largest buyers are China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey. Expanded exports to those countries would put price pressure on competing members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, particularly its archrival Saudi Arabia. With higher production, Iran could challenge the leadership of Saudi Arabia in OPEC in alliance with Iraq and Venezuela.The agreement also was viewed as a possible harbinger of closer cooperation between the United States and Iran against the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq and perhaps of a lessening of regional tensions.A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran.\u201cIf the supreme leader accepts the agreement and Iran complies with the requirements of the deal, and if they adopt a framework friendlier to foreign investment, then Iran\u2019s long-term future as a global supplier is significant,\u201d said David Goldwyn, who was a senior State Department energy official in the first Obama administration. \u201cIt could have a major impact on the geopolitics of both Europe and the Middle East.\u201dOil prices have been bouncing up and down in recent days as news from the nuclear talks alternately raised and diminished hopes of an agreement. Contradictory factors are likely to continue to move oil in a jagged direction in the coming weeks. On the one hand, oil supplies continue to build in the United States and globally. On the other, conflicts in Iraq and Libya threaten to trim their crude exports.The sanctions on Iran have brought a steady decline in oil and natural gas revenue, to $56 billion in the 2013-2014 fiscal year from about $118 billion in the 2011-2012 fiscal year, according to the International Monetary Fund.But even before western sanctions, Iranian oil production was in decline \u2014 from four million barrels a day in late 2007 to 3.5 million barrels a day only four years later. International oil companies, particularly from Europe, Russia and China, have shown an interest in returning to Iran to reinvigorate the oil industry, but it could take years of negotiations and planning for a serious effort to take root. And with oil prices in decline, oil companies are generally cutting back their exploration and production budgets.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very slow for oil companies to go back,\u201d said Dragan Vuckovic, president of Mediterranean International, an oil service company that operates in the Middle East. \u201cIt will take at least a year.

{"Headline": "Marine Le Pen, Leader of France\u2019s National Front Party, Splits With Her Father, Its Founder", "Date": "2015-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn recent years, Ms. Le Pen, trying to clean up the image of her party as racist and anti-Semitic, has kept her distance from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, 86, and his more extreme statements, even as he continued as the party\u2019s honorary chairman.But Mr. Le Pen made headlines over the last week, after he once again claimed that the Nazi gas chambers were a \u201cdetail\u201d of history; praised France\u2019s collaborationist wartime leader, Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain; and questioned whether France\u2019s Spanish-born prime minister, Manuel Valls, was really loyal to France.His outbursts appeared to be more than Ms. Le Pen and her entourage could put up with. In a statement on Wednesday, Ms. Le Pen said she had already told her father that she planned to block him from running in coming regional elections.\u201cJean-Marie Le Pen seems to have descended into a strategy somewhere between scorched earth and political suicide,\u201d she said. \u201cHis status as honorary president does not give him the right to hijack the National Front with vulgar provocations seemingly designed to damage me but which unfortunately hit the whole movement.\u201dShe added that, with great sadness, she was calling a meeting of the party\u2019s executive bureau with her father present \u201cto find the best way of protecting the interests of the movement,\u201d a statement that some experts took to mean that Mr. Le Pen may be expelled from the party altogether.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s deputy and the party\u2019s chief spokesman, Florian Philippot, soon said in a Twitter message, \u201cThe split with Jean-Marie Le Pen is now irrevocable and definitive.\u201dUntil now, disagreements between Jean-Marie and Marine Le Pen, who has both depended on and extended her father\u2019s legacy, were largely kept in check in the interest of party unity. But as Ms. Le Pen looks to broaden her party\u2019s appeal, the rupture on Wednesday made it clear that she would now prize her own political future over, possibly, preserving relations with her father.The bitter nature of their power struggle \u2014 greeted gleefully by their opponents \u2014 seemed to portend a long-awaited reckoning for the National Front. Alongside other far-right parties in Europe, it is currently angling to seize a moment of opportunity made possible by popular anger over rising immigration, failing economies and stifling European Union bureaucracy.But what to do with the elder Mr. Le Pen has been a problem within the National Front for years, experts say. Mr. Le Pen founded the party 43 years ago and spent most of his energy running for president. His continued presence and history of controversial remarks have made it difficult for his daughter to rebrand the party and may have cost her the collaboration she sought with other more moderate far-right parties in the European Union.When she hoped to work as a single caucus with the Dutch and British far-right parties, the leader of Britain\u2019s U.K. Independence Party, Nigel Farage, shunned her, accusing her party of prejudice and anti-Semitism.Mr. Le Pen, however, made clear that he would not be pushed aside without a fight. In his own statement, he said that when called before the executive board, he intended to express his views as a politician who is \u201cresponsible and \u2018free\u2019 and who always walks with his head up.\u201dIn the meantime, he said, \u201ceach should take advantage of the delay to measure their responsibility to France, to the French and to the movement that embodies their hopes.\u201dThe Le Pen family is famous for its living arrangements in the wealthy suburb of Saint-Cloud, west of Paris. Marine Le Pen lived on the family property, which includes gardens and several houses, until September. Her sister and mother, who is divorced from Mr. Le Pen, still live there. Mr. Le Pen now just keeps an office there.When Ms. Le Pen, 46, finally moved out, apparently because her apartment in the former stables was too dark and small, the gossip magazine Closer wrote, \u201cNo more animated discussions with Daddy in the garden.\u201dMs. Le Pen harbors her own presidential ambitions. But she has struggled to move out of her father\u2019s shadow and distinguish her own reputation even as she tries to build a more mainstream party from the bottom up and field candidates in local elections.Distancing herself from her father, some experts say, is unlikely to do her any harm. In fact, it may help put some of the party\u2019s recent mistakes behind her.In departmental elections last month \u2014 a layer of government between county and regional \u2014 the National Front fielded some 7,000 candidates, many of whom had not been vetted.In the waning days of the campaign, dozens were caught making racist statements on their Facebook pages or in public appearances, including one man who called on Muslims to do the world a favor and kill themselves.Thomas Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, a political analyst, said that the news media attention to these wayward candidates had cost the National Front votes. He said the party had been polling at 30 to 33 percent, but it ended up with just 25 percent in the first round.\u201cI think the numbers show that there is a ceiling on the votes the party can win with that kind of talk,\u201d he said.Under Ms. Le Pen, who took over the party in 2011, the National Front has moved away from constant anti-immigrant talk to developing policies on a range of subjects from banking to education. It supports renegotiating France\u2019s treaty with the European Union to restore French borders and the franc. It advocates more teaching of French in schools and greater protectionism for the economy.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s version of the National Front has been enjoying success, tapping into French unhappiness with its two traditional parties after years of a moribund economy.Various polls have found that she would lead in a presidential election, though she would be unlikely to win in the second round. Last year, the party came in first with 25 percent of the vote in European elections and won hundreds of seats and a dozen mayoralties in local elections.It is not the first time Mr. Le Pen and his daughter have been at odds. Last June, for instance, Mr. Le Pen condemned artists who took positions against his party, saying he would make an \u201coven load\u201d of one Jewish singer next time. His daughter condemned the remark, saying her party disapproved of any anti-Semitism.But last week Mr. Le Pen \u2014 28 years after he first remarked that Nazi gas chambers were a \u201cdetail\u201d in history \u2014 was on television saying he stood by those words because \u201cthey were the truth.\u201dAgain, his daughter quickly expressed her dismay.The remarks have dominated the news cycles here since.Laure Fourquet contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Test for Unions and Politicians, a Nationwide Protest on Pay ", "Date": "2015-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe protest by tens of thousands of low-wage workers, students and activists in more than 200 American cities on Wednesday is the most striking effort to date in a two-and-a-half-year-old labor-backed movement that is testing the ability of unions to succeed in an economy populated by easily replaceable service sector workers.Labor has invested tens of millions of dollars in a campaign for a $15-an-hour minimum wage that goes beyond traditional workplace organizing, taking on a cause that has captured broad public support. But the movement is up against a hostile business sector sheltered by a decades-old federal labor law that makes it difficult for workers to directly confront the wealthy corporations that dominate the fast-food and hospitality industries.For political activists looking to the 2016 presidential campaign and beyond, the wage fight is coming at a potentially pivotal moment, the first concrete, large-scale challenge in decades to an economic system they view as skewed toward the wealthy.The protests began with morning rallies that attracted crowds in the hundreds at McDonald\u2019s franchises in Atlanta; Brooklyn; Chicago; Kansas City, Mo.; Los Angeles; and Raleigh, N.C., along with other locations.A noon rally in front of a McDonald\u2019s restaurant on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side attracted throngs of protesters, many of them carrying signs that read \u201cWhy Poverty?\u201d and \u201cWe See Greed.\u201d They included fast-food workers, laundry workers, carwash employees and sympathetic bystanders.\u201cAmerica, period, is unequal,\u201d said Chasten Florence, 26, a construction worker from Jamaica, Queens. \u201cOnce we accept that, we can change that.\"McDonald\u2019s said in a statement: \u201cWe respect people\u2019s right to peacefully protest, and our restaurants remain open every day with the focus on providing an exceptional experience for our customers,\u201dThe campaign, staffed in part by organizers from the Service Employees International Union, orchestrated the country\u2019s first-ever fast-food industry strike in November 2012, when 200 New York City workers walked off their jobs. The periodic protests expanded to six other cities in the spring of 2013, 60 cities in August of that year, 150 cities in May 2014, and 190 last December.The protests have coincided with an extraordinary shift in the political consensus on the minimum wage. In the last two years, Seattle has moved to gradually increase its minimum wage to $15 an hour, from $9.32. Oakland, Calif., established a new minimum wage of $12.25, while Chicago approved an increase to $13, from $8.25, over the next four years. Alaska and Arkansas passed minimum wage increases by referendum in 2014.In 2013, President Obama endorsed raising the federal minimum wage to $9, from $7.25 an hour, then increased that to $10.10 by the fall of that year. Democrats in the Senate are now working on a proposal to raise the national minimum wage to $12 by 2020.\u201cThe labor movement has been stuck,\u201d said Janice R. Fine, an associate professor of Labor Studies at Rutgers University. \u201cThey deserve a lot of credit in deciding that, in a situation this bleak, you needed \u2018climate change\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014 that is, a change in how the public views low-wage work \u2014 \u201cbefore you\u2019d actually get an opportunity to organize again.\u201dPartly in response to the political shift as well as competitive pressure from tighter labor markets, several major employers of low-wage workers have moved to raised their base pay in recent months. Walmart, Target and McDonald\u2019s have all announced plans to increase their minimum wage to or near $10, though for McDonald\u2019s it would apply only to the roughly 10 percent of its workers employed directly by the company, not by its franchisees.But business groups argue that a substantially higher increase would force employers to reduce hiring, accelerate automation and even threaten the basic economic model of some industries.But it was the result of a calculation that the 20th-century model of organizing workers was rapidly becoming obsolete for those in a growing sector where employers considered it essentially costless to replace them. \u201cWe can no longer change our lives, and our kids\u2019 lives, without the support of a broader movement of workers,\u201d Ms. Henry said.The origins of the Fight for $15 campaign date back to early 2012, when organizers from New York Communities for Change, which had built support for Occupy Wall Street activists among more established progressive activists and labor organizers, began canvassing low-income New Yorkers, many of them employed in the fast-food industry.\u201cPeople know Walmart and McDonald\u2019s are doing pretty well, people at top,\u201d said Leslie McCall, a professor of sociology at Northwestern University, who has closely analyzed the opinion data on inequality. \u201cIt was like: \u2018Wait a minute. We\u2019re into the recovery, the unemployment rate is going down. But most people aren\u2019t doing well.\u2019\u00a0\u201dEven politically moderate voters appear to believe that it is the responsibility of corporations to mitigate the problem. In her own preliminary surveys, Professor McCall found that, when asked to choose who should be most responsible for reducing inequality \u2014 the poor, the rich, the government, major companies, or that it did not need to be reduced \u2014 a plurality of Republican respondents, about 37 percent, chose \u201cmajor companies.\u201dThe Fight for $15 campaign hopes to harness these sentiments in ways that Occupy Wall Street never quite succeeded in doing. In Seattle, Steve Gelb, who makes above minimum wage at a work force training outfit, said he supported the protests because \u201cthe disparity of wealth has reached alarming proportions and the salaries of business owners and executives are way out of proportion.\u201dBut the odds are still long on whether fast-food workers can formally organize in significant numbers, and push employers to raise wages to their target. Because most are employed by thousands of independent franchisees, rather than corporations like McDonald\u2019s, the coordination challenge is enormous.For this reason, the minimum wage protests remain only a small piece of a broader strategy intent on dragging McDonald\u2019s to the bargaining table. The S.E.I.U. and other labor groups have tried to spur a tax-avoidance investigation against McDonald\u2019s in Europe. An S.E.I.U.-affiliated investment fund has campaigned against insider corporate directors in McDonald\u2019s Japan.Most prominently, the groups have helped to bring a complaint, currently being litigated before a National Labor Relations Board judge, challenging the franchise model that allows McDonald\u2019s to disclaim \u201cjoint employer\u201d status for most of the workers at its restaurants.\u201cTo the extent we worry about this, that\u2019s the worry here, the policy change brewing in the background,\u201d said Glenn Spencer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cIt would change the terms of the franchise model, make it not viable.\u201dMr. Spencer said the model extended well beyond the fast-food industry \u2014 to hotels, rental cars, auto maintenance and even tax preparation services \u2014 and described the protests as \u201cthe P.R. wing of this attempt to get policy changed.\u201dC.

{"Headline": "New York Taxi Mogul, Seeking a Bailout, Says He\u2019s Too Big to Fail", "Date": "2015-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRough RideOne of New York City\u2019s largest taxi fleet owners is asking for a bailout.Evgeny Freidman, known as Gene, said in an interview Thursday that the taxi industry, like the financial industry, was too big to fail. He would like the city to guarantee taxi medallion loans, which would induce banks to extend more credit to fleet owners like him, and he compares this approach to the federal government\u2019s actions to save large banks and insurers in 2008.\u201cI still see Bernanke saying, \u2018I hate A.I.G.; I don\u2019t want to give them any more money, but I have to,\u2019 \u201d he said, referring to the former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and the large insurer that was bailed out in 2008.Mr. Freidman\u2019s problem is not unlike that of any homeowner who bought real estate in the early part of the century thinking prices could only go up. In New York, medallions, the license that is required to operate a yellow taxi, are fixed in number, and their price rose for decades because of increased demand and restricted supply.Prices peaked in 2013, not just in New York but also in other large markets like Boston and Chicago. Prices have declined as taxis have faced competition from car service apps like Uber. At the top, the price for New York mini-fleet medallions, which may be owned by nondrivers, was over $1.2 million.Medallions have typically been financed with debt, but creditors have become skittish because of falling prices. The lack of access to credit has caused medallion sales to slow to a trickle as buyers have faced great difficulty finding financing; this has also made it difficult for medallion owners facing loan maturities to sell.Brett Berman, a lawyer for Mr. Freidman, issued a six-page letter on Thursday with a warning to creditors, city officials and other \u201cstakeholders\u201d in the taxi industry: \u201cShould you fail to act and permit or contribute to Mr. Freidman\u2019s failure, such action or inaction will have an effect on the medallion industry across the country.\u201dMr. Freidman said the disruption from sharply falling medallion prices and seized-up credit markets would hurt governments, which collect revenue from taxes on medallion sales and taxi fares. He said it would also harm riders, with taxis being taken out of circulation as their medallions were foreclosed on. He contends that the whole situation is \u201cartificial\u201d and that government intervention to prop up the lending market would cause prices to return to \u201cnormal.\u201d Government guarantees for owners like him might allow him to maintain the value of his assets and continue to produce revenue from them.Of course, there are a few problems with his argument. The first is that there was nothing \u201cnormal\u201d about a New York taxi medallion costing more than a million dollars. Before medallion prices started falling in 2013, they more than quadrupled in a decade.Sometimes, a normally stable market is rocked by a liquidity crisis, and the government can calm the waters by offering guarantees that induce people to lend. In this case, there is no reason to believe the million dollar medallion that existed pre-crisis was a stable condition. If New York City guaranteed medallion loans and the prices kept falling anyway, the city could lose a lot of money \u2014 and taxpayers would end up paying the banks.It is also easy to identify non-\u201cartificial\u201d drivers of the medallion price declines. A medallion\u2019s value is determined by the expectation of future taxi revenue. The real income generated by medallions is affected by competition from Uber, and also by the expansion of the city\u2019s green cab program, which created a new class of vehicles that picks up street-hailing passengers outside Manhattan.As Mr. Freidman himself noted, he is no longer able to charge the city\u2019s legal maximum lease rate for yellow cabs because fewer people are interested in driving them; this is a fundamental reason prices are declining. There are also future risks. Medallion values could be further impaired by economic changes outside the control of New York City, such as rising interest rates. Another reason medallions gained so much value in recent years was that record-low interest rates made them cheap to finance.Most important, medallion owners are not actually too big to fail. There have been a handful of foreclosure sales of medallions over the last six months. If many more medallions are foreclosed upon and held on bank balance sheets, they could still be leased to drivers under bank ownership.In other words, a crisis in the financial economy around the taxi industry need not necessarily lead to an actual shortage of taxis. In this case, the situation is not like houses, where a credit crunch can lead to cessation of home construction and the neglect of vacant, foreclosed homes. Also cutting against the likelihood of a cab shortage: the existence of Uber, which is a close substitute for yellow taxis.Still, Mr. Freidman contends medallion owners deserve a government backstop because of financial support they have provided New York City by buying medallions at auction.\u201cI have delivered, personally, in excess of $300 million to the city in these auctions,\u201d he said. \u201cDo I not have a little bit of standing to say there should be support from that institution that I delivered, personally, $300 million to? To do what the government does for every other industry? Am I not being logical?\u201dThe Committee for Taxi Safety, a trade association that represents many New York City taxi medallion owners (but not Mr. Freidman), declined to comment on his letter. The Taxi and Limousine Commission did not respond to a request for comment by press time.Advertisement"}

Scott Walker of Wisconsin repeatedly laced into Mrs. Clinton as well, charging that she \u201cthinks the way to grow the economy is to grow Washington\u201d and would not reform federal entitlement programs that many Democrats cherish. He also cast her as out of touch by contrasting his discount shopping habits with hers: \u201cI doubt that the presumptive nominee for the other party has ever been to Kohl\u2019s before, let alone shopped in the last 15 to 20 years.\u201d And he had a warning for anyone who believed that Mrs. Clinton would return the United States to the economically prosperous days of the 1990s.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a third term of Bill Clinton \u2014 this is a third term of Barack Obama,\u201d Mr. Walker said. The attacks by Mr. Paul and Mr. Walker were the most pointed by the Republican hopefuls on the former secretary of state. Responding to a question on whether Mrs. Clinton might face a primary challenge from within her Democratic Party, Mr. Paul won laughs by cracking that she would soon need two planes: \u201cone for her and her entourage and one for her baggage.\u201dDonald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention.The two-day event here in New Hampshire, where the nation\u2019s first primary will be held early next year, showcased the talents, tactics and breadth of the Republican field. The 2012 presidential race featured several Republicans who made little impression on the party\u2019s voters, who have typically nominated longtime leaders (Ronald Reagan, the elder George Bush, Bob Dole, John McCain) or high-profile governors with strong networks of donors (George W. Bush, Mitt Romney).The race for the 2016 Republican nomination has a mix of prominent candidates and lesser-known but fiery ones. The critiques here on Friday and Saturday showed the bluntness of some of the candidates, the humor of others and the strategic interests of several \u2014 including those who chose not to mention Mrs. Clinton and to introduce themselves to voters in a more positive light. And all of them sought to project the experience, knowledge and steeliness needed to take on a politician of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s stature.Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida talked at length on Friday about his record of creating jobs and increasing graduation rates. He presented an implied contrast not only with Mrs. Clinton but also with his less-experienced Republican rivals, like Senator Marco Rubio, also of Florida. \u201cAccomplishment matters; leadership matters,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cWho sits behind the big desk as it relates to the presidency is different than perhaps United States senator or another job.\u201d Mr. Bush also made a glancing comment about the scant Democratic opposition to Mrs. Clinton, noting that he expected a tough fight for the Republican nomination.\u201cI don\u2019t see any coronation coming my way,\u201d he said in response to a question from one of the 600 people in the audience. In a nod to the many other Republicans running or likely to run, he joked, \u201cI\u2019m really intimidating a whole bunch of folks, aren\u2019t I?\u201dMr. Rubio offered ambitious ideas for restructuring the nation\u2019s higher education system, such as having colleges tell students how much money they might earn with certain degrees before they take out loans. But first, he warmed up the crowd by noting that Mrs. Clinton might try to raise as much as $2.5 billion for her campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of Chipotle, my friends,\u201d he said to laughter.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas took a lighter tack, joking that he thought he had seen Mrs. Clinton here, but must have been wrong because \u201cy\u2019all don\u2019t have any foreign nations paying speakers, right?\u201d \u2014 a reference to some overseas donations to her family foundation.But Mr. Christie did take a shot at Mr. Obama that could also apply to a future Democratic president.\u201cWe can no longer afford to have weakness in the Oval Office,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need strength and clarity and hard truths.\u201dOnly occasionally did the Republicans go after one another. Mr. Walker, asked by a reporter about his chances against Mr. Bush for their party\u2019s nomination, argued that voters in New Hampshire and elsewhere were looking for a different breed of candidate than a third Bush would represent. \u201cThey want a new fresh face, particularly if we\u2019re going to as a party take on Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said.Mr. Paul, without naming names, noted his difference of opinion with Mr. Bush and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina over confirming Loretta E. Lynch as attorney general, which Mr. Paul opposes, and he separated himself from foreign policy hawks in the party. \u201cThere\u2019s a group of folks in our party who would have troops in six countries right now, maybe more,\u201d Mr. Paul said. Some possible candidates, like Mr. Rubio and Mr. Graham, have called for a more interventionist foreign policy that could include additional American ground troops in the Middle East.The candidates spoke before New Hampshire party activists and elected officials who came primed, after a week of news coverage about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential bid, to hear a robust Republican rebuttal.In the 30 minutes they each had to engage the audience through speeches, question-and-answer exchanges or both, the 19 Republicans faced the tactical decisions of whether to attack Mrs. Clinton openly or target her in subtler ways, and whether to go after her in personal terms or on policy \u2014 or ignore her altogether. Mr. Graham predicted that Mrs. Clinton would become more central as the election got closer, but said Republican animosity toward Mr. Obama made him a more resonant target right now.\u201cI have never seen anything like this,\u201d Mr. Graham said in an interview, referring to Republican contempt for Mr. Obama. He noted that it was even more deep-seated than their anger toward President Clinton, whom Republicans impeached. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty high bar,\u201d he said dryly. (Mr. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate.)Hitting Mrs. Clinton hard was the sort of red meat for which some audience members were hungering, but getting too personal carried the political risk of appearing minor league. By being memorable for attacking Mrs. Clinton, candidates risked losing a chance to define themselves in a positive way and highlight differences with their Republican rivals. After all, the party nomination still has to be won.Party activists, in speeches interspersed with those of the presidential hopefuls, were more cutting in their attacks on Mrs. Clinton, and state party officials handed out red bumper stickers that read \u201c#StopHillary.\u201dThe gathering was believed to be the first of its kind in New Hampshire, reflecting the determination of the state party to showcase its political might over the next 19 months. Its goal is to bring New Hampshire back to the Republican column in the 2016 general election, after Mr. Obama\u2019s victories here in 2012 and 2008 and John Kerry\u2019s narrow win over George W. Bush in 2004. Mr. Bush carried the state in 2000. Operatives from the Republican National Committee, on their own panel, expressed confidence that they could damage Mrs. Clinton based on her record, especially at the State Department.\u201cOn their side, they have Hillary or nothing,\u201d said Sean Spicer, the committee\u2019s communications director. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to figure out how to groom Chelsea.\u201dSome of the sharpest attacks on Mrs. Clinton came from Republicans who are virtually nowhere in the polls and are looking for ways to get attention.Perhaps the most personal remark came from Carly Fiorina, the former business executive, when she made an unmistakable reference to Mr. Clinton\u2019s affair with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Discussing a cable TV segment in which questions were raised about whether women had the hormonal capacity to serve as president, Ms. Fiorina said sarcastically, \u201cNot that we have seen a man\u2019s judgment being clouded by hormones, including in the Oval Office.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Premier Says Annexation of Crimea Was Worth Sanctions Fallout", "Date": "2015-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Prime Minister Dmitri A.

{"Headline": "In Italy, Matteo Renzi Aims to Upend the Old World Order", "Date": "2015-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 In a tailored black suit, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi stood before the Italian Senate recently and applauded lawmakers for taking some tough votes on reforms that he boasted would jump-start the country\u2019s economy after the longest slump in its modern history.But what he did not bring up is that he is asking them to take an even tougher vote, to essentially abolish the Senate itself, which Mr. Renzi and many others regard as emblematic of a broken political system that often seems designed not to get things done.The speech was vintage Renzi: brash and boastful, framed in a better-days-ahead optimism, even as senators already understood the knife-in-the-ribs reality of the reform program. At 40, Mr. Renzi is the youngest prime minister in Italy\u2019s history, having assumed office on promises to tear down the country\u2019s ossified political structure and rebuild the country for a younger generation.\u201cIt\u2019s important to underline the new direction of the European Union,\u201d Mr. Renzi said during a recent interview in his office in Rome, noting that Europe needed to move away from only \u201cdiscussing budgets and austerity.\u201d He added, \u201cWe have an identity, dreams, hope and strategy.\u201d\u201cItaly can make or break the European Union,\u201d said Roberto D\u2019Alimonte, a political analyst in Florence. He added: \u201cLook at Italy from Berlin. What other leader can Merkel trust? Renzi is the only one.\u201dMr. Renzi\u2019s operating style is a blend of high-octane energy, skilled public communications and ruthless political maneuvering. He is still unproven as an administrator, and his reform push has angered segments of the opposition as well as entrenched interests in his center-left Democratic Party.Traditional allies, like trade unions, are furious about labor market changes that they say favor business. Old-guard politicians, right and left, are wary that his diminution of the Senate, along with proposed changes to the electoral law and the Constitution, would place too much power in the executive branch.\u201cHe is destroying all the checks and balances,\u201d said Renato Brunetta, a lawmaker in Italy\u2019s lower house of Parliament with the opposition party Forza Italia. \u201cRenzi is moving the institutional structure of the country in an authoritarian direction.\u201dFor years, entrenched leaders dominated Italy\u2019s center-left and followed a consensus-driven model that critics say left the party paralyzed and beholden to special interests. Since his days as mayor of Florence, Mr. Renzi has openly challenged the older political generation, describing himself as the \u201cDemolition Man\u201d who would toss the established leadership onto the scrap heap \u2014 a stand that resonated with young people chafing for opportunities.\u201cThere is a huge conflict between generations,\u201d said Tommaso Giuntella, 30, president of the Democratic Party\u2019s branch in Rome. \u201cRenzi knows it and started being the face of the new generation, the generation of the sons. He said, \u2018We cannot permit the son to pay for the privileges of the father.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThis generational theme underpins Mr. Renzi\u2019s most concrete legislative achievement: a new labor law, known as the Jobs Act, that he argues will gradually bring fairness to Italy\u2019s bifurcated system of permanent and temporary work contracts.\u201cHe has chosen to represent entrepreneurs and the employers, not the workers,\u201d said Serena Sorrentino, a senior official with CGIL, the country\u2019s largest trade union. \u201cHe has broken with the traditions of the Democratic left.\u201dSitting at his desk in Palazzo Chigi, his official residence in Rome, Mr. Renzi periodically checked messages on two mobile phones as he described the criticisms from traditional allies as unsurprising. He compared his agenda to what Mr. Blair did with Britain\u2019s Labour Party during the 1990s and cited a famous quip by Mr. Blair, who promised to follow party traditions, except the tradition of losing elections.\u201cThe risk was to transform the Labour Party from a loser party into a winner party,\u201d Mr. Renzi said, speaking in English that has drawn teasing on social media but has improved rapidly in recent months.\u201cWhat is the identity in Italy of the left?\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is to give more rights to young people, give possibilities to a new generation. We had, in Italy, a work apartheid. The Jobs Act is the most leftist thing I\u2019ve done.\u201dIn response, Mr. Renzi is trying to push the Democratic Party toward the middle to become what analysts call a \u201ccatchall\u201d party.Polls show that Mr. Renzi is easily Italy\u2019s most popular politician, which, in turn, has enhanced his standing in Europe. For years, infighting prevented the Democratic Party from joining Europe\u2019s center-left political coalition, the European Socialists. Under Mr. Renzi, the party joined immediately and is now much more influential at the European level.Last May, the party dominated the Italian elections for the European Parliament, winning a record 41 percent of the vote, a notable result since the other pro-Europe party that fared strongly was Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union in Germany.Even as he has been sharp-elbowed in Italy, Mr. Renzi has pursued more collegial tactics at the European level. His credibility in Berlin and Brussels has most likely been enhanced by his arms-length approach toward anti-austerity, left-wing newcomers who might seem like natural allies, notably Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece. Mr. Renzi has supported finding a compromise in the Greek standoff, but has been careful in how he positions himself.His reform agenda at home still has a long way to go. Even as critics warn he is pushing too fast, others say he has done too little. His political and electoral changes are intended to eliminate the mushy indecisiveness of Italian parliamentary elections and create a formula that produces a clearer winner.He would also overhaul Italy\u2019s dysfunctional political structure by placing most legislative powers in the lower house and transforming the Senate, long known as a graveyard of legislation, into more of a regional body. If approved by Parliament, the constitutional changes to the Senate would be put to voters in a national referendum, most likely next year.It is a huge agenda for a country where politics has often been immobilized. Mr. Renzi\u2019s supporters call him Italy\u2019s last chance and praise him for confronting entrenched interests. Yet his critics increasingly describe him as authoritarian, a characterization that Mr. Renzi (as well as many analysts) says is unwarranted. But in recent days, Mr. Renzi has spoken about the need for term limits for prime ministers and even mused about the limits of his own appetite for the job.\u201cFor Italy, this is a time of decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the youngest leader Italy has ever had. I am using my energy and dynamism to change my country. I think it is time to write a new page for Italy. I can\u2019t wait for the old problems of the past.\u201dGaia Pianigiani and Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Macedonia Steps Backward", "Date": "2015-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTHE HAGUE \u2014 Last year, I turned down an ambassadorial posting to Moscow and ended my 18-year diplomatic career. Serving my government and my country, Macedonia, had become very different things, and I felt there wasn\u2019t much I could do from within to make a difference. Recent events have only reinforced this view. Once praised as a success story in a region riven by war, Macedonia is in crisis and urgently needs European Union intervention.In February, Zoran Zaev, head of the opposition Social-Democratic Alliance for Macedonia, or SDSM, accused Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski of orchestrating the illegal surveillance of some 20,000 people, including judges, foreign ambassadors, opposition politicians, journalists and police officials. According to Mr. Zaev, some were under surveillance for about four years. As proof, Mr. Zaev has released a series of recorded conversations, allegedly featuring himself and other political leaders, including Mr. Gruevski\u2019s supporters. Mr. Gruevski denies the allegations, insisting that the recordings were concocted by a foreign intelligence service \u2014 which he has yet to name \u2014 to instigate a coup. Mr. Zaev says the material came from whistle-blowers within Macedonian intelligence. He has been charged with \u201cviolence against representatives of the highest state authorities.\u201d Five others, including police and intelligence personnel, were charged with espionage. One has since been sentenced to three years in prison. Mr. Gruevski and ministers in his conservative VMRO-DPMNE party claim the recordings were doctored. But that charge is unlikely to stick. The SDSM has provided transcripts to journalists who were allegedly surveilled, and a number of them have confirmed the accuracy of those documents. Rufi Osmani, founder of the Albanian minority National Democratic Revival party, and Ljupco Svrgovski, a former public prosecutor, have also verified the accuracy of transcripts in which they appear. If the recordings are legitimate, as looks increasingly likely, it would seem that no Macedonian public institutions are free of government control. The conversations suggest a series of nefarious electoral practices by the VMRO-DPMNE, including manipulating voter lists and IDs and threatening to fine private companies suspected of supporting the opposition. On one tape, a voice widely attributed to be that of Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska is heard asking if a particular appellate court candidate can be considered \u201cone hundred percent ours.\u201d Another recording, according to Mr. Zaev, indicates that the country\u2019s intelligence chief, Saso Mijalkov, accepted bribes in exchange for concluding a surveillance equipment deal with Israel in 2011. Macedonia peacefully gained independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. In 1999, it sheltered over 300,000 Albanian refugees from Kosovo, and served as a NATO base. Ethnic tensions persisted, but in 2001, when fighting between ethnic Albanian militants and Macedonian security forces threatened full-blown civil war, a peace deal that included power-sharing provisions kept the country together. That year, Macedonia became the first Western Balkan country to sign a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the European Union, opening the door to accession. In 2006, when Mr. Gruevski became prime minister, Macedonia was a functional, multiethnic democracy with a prospective future in both the European Union and NATO. Mr. Gruevski, a former finance minister, pledged to improve the economy and fight corruption, and was widely perceived as a successful reformer. His early attempts to make the country more business-friendly were promising. But somewhere along the line he lost his moral compass. Macedonia\u2019s potential has gone unfulfilled.  Reporters Without Borders ranks Macedonia 117th globally (and last among E.U. and West Balkan countries) in its World Press Freedom Index, down from 45th in 2006. News of the wiretapping scandal is getting out, mostly via the Internet and independent media. But the country\u2019s main outlets have refused to air the recordings, leaving many Macedonians unable to judge the extent of corruption. In March, the SDSM, which has boycotted Parliament since general elections last April, urged the formation of an interim government to hold elections and ensure the independence of state institutions. This is commendable, but it\u2019s hard to see how this will be achieved without outside help. The European Union, which last year expressed \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the \u201cincreasing politicization of state institutions and government control over media,\u201d has made efforts to mediate. European Parliament members have met with VMRO-DPMNE and SDSM representatives in Brussels, and there is consensus on the need for further talks.But the European Union must take a tougher line. It must make clear that Macedonia is no longer a functioning democracy, call for the government to resign, and support the formation of an interim government. Once in place, the European Union should work to help reform state institutions, ensure an independent investigation of Mr. Zaev\u2019s allegations, and prepare free and fair elections. If the VMRO-DPMNE won\u2019t cooperate, the European Commission should threaten to freeze Macedonia\u2019s E.U. accession process.Macedonia became an E.U. candidate country in 2005, and has since been allocated over 600 million euros in pre-accession funds. It has made little progress toward membership, however, mostly due to Greek objections over the country\u2019s official name (Greece\u2019s northern region is also called Macedonia). But Mr. Zaev\u2019s revelations suggest much more legitimate reasons to shelve accession for now. Once Macedonia is back on its feet, its path to E.U. membership must be freed from Greece\u2019s grip. This is as significant for the credibility of union enlargement as it is for Macedonia\u2019s future. The crisis my country faces represents a failure of Europe\u2019s much-applauded enlargement policy. Had accession negotiations been allowed to start years ago, Macedonia\u2019s reformist forces would today be much stronger, and the current problems could likely have been avoided. It is my fervent hope that, if this impasse can be overcome, I will be able to proudly serve my country again. Advertisement"}

Mr. Putin wants to expand his country\u2019s influence and standing, but his alarming behavior has estranged Russia from most other major powers, damaged its economy and narrowed its future options.American officials say they have seen no evidence that Russia has actually begun to reposition or make ready a nuclear arsenal that still contains thousands of weapons. But even if the Russian threats are loose talk to intimidate adversaries or curry favor with nationalists at home, they reflect a cynical disregard for Russia\u2019s post-Cold War role as a partner with America in arms control treaties designed to discourage the spread of nuclear weapons. These threats inevitably raise tensions and could increase the chances of deadly miscalculations. There have been scores of similar episodes over the past year as NATO increased its air patrols in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. Russia\u2019s bellicose behavior is a serious test for NATO, which has sometimes shown disturbing divisions. The Europeans and the United States have to stay united in maintaining sanctions on Russia and in continuing air patrols and training exercises, as it becomes increasingly difficult to predict Mr. Putin\u2019s next move.

An Oxford-educated investment fund manager, Mr. Pirouz, 43, received the news just after landing on the Mediterranean island of Majorca.\u201cPeople in the terminal must have thought I was crazy,\u201d he added.As details of the framework agreement were sifted here, however, the outlines of the deal was immediately criticized for what hard-liners called overly deep concessions by Iran.There was no reaction from Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in recent weeks has emphasized that all Iranians should support the negotiations. But now that a framework has been reached, analysts said that he would allow those criticizing a deal \u2014 he might do so himself \u2014 to voice their opposition.\u201cWe can expect him to listen to all sides,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to the government of President Rouhani. \u201cThat means that we might even see hard-liners gaining more power in the coming months; on the other hand, it also might be different. We have to wait and see how this will play out.A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran.\u201cNo matter how we try to sugarcoat it,\u201d Mr. Laylaz added, \u201cthis means we no longer will have an industrial-scale enrichment program. This is the price we have to pay for earlier mistakes.\u201dOthers also expressed disappointment about the terms for Iran and noted that the deal itself would do little to change the underlying differences with the United States.\u201cAccording to the U.S. interpretation, significant concessions have been made, and sanctions will not be removed in the way many here were expecting,\u201d said Mohammad Marandi, a professor of North American studies at Tehran University.Mr. Marandi, who has been critical of the United States government, pointed at the rise of Saudi- and Turkish-backed extremism in the Middle East and emphasized that under current circumstances there could be no normal relationship with Washington.\u201cWhat we really want to see from the Americans is an end to their support of countries like Saudi Arabia and Turkey who support extremist groups,\u201d he said. \u201cMake no mistake, the Middle East may soon explode, and we need a clear signal from the Americans to see where they stand.\u201dAt the important Friday Prayer session in Tehran, a bastion of hard-liners, there were the usual chants of \u201cdeath to America,\u201d but efforts were also made to push the nuclear negotiations to a wider audience.Mr. Rouhani\u2019s first adviser took the stage to give the pre-sermon speech and lauded the agreements made in Lausanne, Switzerland, as good achievements.\u201cThose who never wanted us to have the right to enrichment now agree we have that right,\u201d said the adviser, Mohammad Nahavandian. \u201cThose who opposed us having the full fuel cycle now no longer oppose. Instead of sanctions, they now speak of cooperation. We have not retreated. Those opposing this deal are enemies, in line with the Zionists.\u201dWorshipers basking in the spring sun were also optimistic.\u201cIf it is in our national interest to make an understanding with the West, we should do it,\u201d said Mohsen Abdollahi, a cleric in a white turban on his way to the V.I.P. section of the prayer hall at Tehran University. \u201cWe can even stop shouting \u2018death to America\u2019 if it is needed.\u201dStill, most in Tehran seem first and foremost to be hoping for a revival of the economy once the sanctions are lifted. Being able again to sell oil to the European Union and to have restrictions on sales to Asia lifted by the United States could bring in much-needed cash for Mr. Rouhani\u2019s government, Mr. Laylaz said.\u201cStill, I hope the government will be responsible and not start to inject all this cash into the economy, as inflation will skyrocket,\u201d Mr. Laylaz said. He added that many of Iran\u2019s economic problems were caused by mismanagement and corruption, not by sanctions.Mr. Pirouz, the fund manager, had long ago bet on Iran to open up. It seemed, he said, that the moment was now very near.His inbox was overflowing with messages of congratulations from well-known international funds that over the past year had shown interest in investing in Iran, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Trade Talks, Secrecy or Openness?", "Date": "2015-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetterTo the Editor:Margot E. Kaminski\u2019s call for greater trade openness is correct. Indeed, secrecy is even impairing our responsibility as members of Congress to exercise effective oversight.Open trade should begin with open access. Unfortunately, the office of the United States Trade Representative thrives on secrecy, opposing proposals from our trading partners for greater openness and denying Congress full access to information already available to foreign governments.Congressional staff members with a \u201ctop secret\u201d clearance have been allowed only within the last month a limited review of texts stamped \u201cconfidential\u201d by the trade representative solely to deny access. If these trade deals are so good, why so secret?A meaningful trade debate must be more than a flashcard \u201cpro\u201d or \u201ccon\u201d response. Evaluating an agreement\u2019s true effect must involve more than merely counting widgets crossing international borders. We cannot afford a race to the bottom for workers, the environment and taxpayers.LLOYD DOGGETTWashington To the Editor:Margot E. Kaminski plays down two critical facts. One is that transparency during talks has costs.To reach an international agreement in our national interest, our negotiators typically have to make concessions. If special interests who will lose are encouraged to pile on before our negotiators have time to bring home concessions from abroad, we might never see any agreements that are truly in the national interest.Second, when a provisional trade deal is reached, we get full transparency after the talks during the ratification process. Any citizen or group will be able to study it and argue that Congress should approve or reject it. Knowing this gives negotiators an incentive to bring back a deal that will pass. But Congress can reject a deal negotiated in secret.Ms. Kaminski is right that the United States Trade Representative Office\u2019s advisory committees have long been heavily imbalanced in favor of producer representatives. This is partly because the trade representative uses the committee to massage the interests as well as listen to them.The best remedy in general, not only for the current talks: The American president should add more nonproducer representatives to this committee, give them equal access and keep talks confidential. Congress should extend the time for open debate to four or six months from two months, for greater fairness for all sides.JOHN ODELLPasadena, Calif.

{"Headline": "Marijuana Taxes Won\u2019t Save State Budgets", "Date": "2015-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRevenue DisappointmentColorado\u2019s marijuana tax collections are not as high as expected.In February 2014, Gov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s office projected Colorado would take in $118 million in taxes on recreational marijuana in its first full year after legalization. With seven months of revenue data in, his office has cut that projection and believes it will collect just $69 million through the end of the fiscal year in June, a miss of 42 percent.That figure is consequential in two ways. First, it\u2019s a wide miss. Second, compared with Colorado\u2019s all-funds budget of $27 billion, neither $69 million nor $118 million is a large number.In the political debate over marijuana policy, fiscal benefits \u2014 bringing marijuana into the legal economy and taxing it \u2014 have loomed large. The summary of the marijuana legalization question put before voters in 2012 stipulated the first $40 million raised by one of the three taxes on recreational marijuana would be put toward school construction each year. In practice, Colorado is likely to receive just $20 million from that tax this year.Colorado\u2019s marijuana taxes are part of a broader trend in recent years: States, looking for ways to close budget shortfalls without raising broad-based taxes, have leaned on \u201csin\u201d revenues: higher taxes on cigarettes, higher fees and fines and higher revenue from gambling. And as they have sought to squeeze more revenue from these sources, they have often been disappointed.Gambling revenue has stagnated as markets have become saturated. Nearly every state has legal gambling, including 37 states with casinos. Expansions of gambling do more to siphon revenue from existing gambling outlets than to generate new tax and lottery revenue.High cigarette taxes have led to counterfeiting of tax stamps and cross-border smuggling of cigarettes from low-tax jurisdictions to high-tax ones. Because the taxes have also succeeded in the policy goal of reducing smoking, the other policy goal of raising revenue is less of a success.In the case of marijuana, Colorado\u2019s revenue has disappointed because legal recreational marijuana sales have been lower than expected. State officials thought many customers of medical marijuana dispensaries would migrate to the recreational market. But this process has been slow, in part because there is a financial disincentive to switch: Medical marijuana is subject only to general sales tax, while a 15 percent tax is imposed on recreational marijuana at wholesale and a further 10 percent at retail, in additional to the general sales tax. \u201cIf commercial cannabis is $2 per gram at retail, I doubt people will bother getting a medical card,\u201d Mr. Kleiman says. Because the state\u2019s marijuana tax is levied per dollar, not per gram, a sharp drop in prices would mean even less tax revenue.Another lesson is that marijuana taxes should be \u201cspecific excise\u201d taxes per unit of intoxicant. In most states, cigarettes are taxed by the pack and alcohol by the liter. Marijuana could similarly be taxed by the gram (either of plant or of T.H.C.), which would protect states from revenue declines if pretax prices fall. Taxes on intoxicants are meant to offset the negative social effects of intoxicant use; the size of those effects should not be expected to vary with market price.But even if Colorado got all this right, improved revenues would not be among the most important effects that marijuana legalization has on the state.\u201cTax revenue is nice to have, but in most states is not going to be enough to change the budget picture significantly,\u201d Mr. Kleiman says. \u201cThe stakes in reducing criminal activity and incarceration and protecting public health are way higher than the stakes in generating revenue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oil Makes a Comeback in Pennsylvania ", "Date": "2015-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt wasn\u2019t quite a Jed Clampett moment: Instead of shootin\u2019 for some food, Samuel Kier was drillin\u2019 for some salt in his salt wells in the appropriately named Saltsburg in Indiana County, Pa., close to Pittsburgh.He kept finding this smelly and gooey black stuff coming from the ground, fouling the salt \u2014 sometimes almost spontaneously catching fire.Trying to make lemonade out of this lemon, he experimented with the gooey stuff. By 1848 he started selling a distillate of it as Seneca Oil, an elixir, and then a proto-Vaseline as a topical ointment.It wasn\u2019t until 1851 that Mr. Kier became the first oil baron when he started manufacturing Carbon Oil, a kerosene that would replace whale oil as a fuel for lamps. By 1853, Mr. Kier was making as much as $40,000 a year, a mighty sum, from his new refinery.By the late 1850s, prospectors were billowing about western Pennsylvania, looking for deposits of what came to be called \u201cpetroleum,\u201d much like those who prompted the California gold rush a decade earlier.In the last decade, too, prospectors \u2014 this time mostly larger mining corporations \u2014 have come to seek a new Pennsylvania fuel bonanza in the Marcellus shale fields. While it may seem incongruous in the modern day, Pennsylvania was where the American oil industry started, well before it moved southwest to places like Texas, and now it is experiencing a renaissance.\u201cKier discovered so much oil, he didn\u2019t know what to do with it,\u201d said Charles McCollester, retired professor of industrial labor relations at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThe Delaware Indians in northwest Pennsylvania, where oil would bubble to the surface, considered it the blood of the Evil One oozing out of the Earth.\u201dIn 1859, Edwin Drake drilled the first big mechanical oil well in Titusville, Pa. Mr. Drake\u2019s well, only 69 feet deep, produced the first \u201cgusher,\u201d the oil coming out so quickly it was difficult to cap. It made Mr. Drake and his backers rich for two years, until those who came after him drilled so much in places around him, like Oil City and Pithole, that they drove the price down, forcing Mr. Drake to close shop.\u201cOil has always been a boom and bust,\u201d said Philip Scranton, professor of history emeritus at Rutgers. Nonetheless, thanks to the modern techniques of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, there has been an 1860s-like growth of shale drilling in Pennsylvania throughout the northern counties and southwestern part of the state. According to Mark Price, a labor economist with the Keystone Research Council in Harrisburg, in 2005, there were only eight wells dug in the state\u2019s Marcellus region. By 2008, the state had 335 new wells, and three years later, nearly 2,000 wells were drilled. He said there was not a big explosion in new wells right now, but he expected the industry to stay at its current levels for a while.In the 19th-century Pennsylvania oil boom years, cities would be founded, grow exponentially in a short time, then become almost ghost towns as prices rode the roller coaster down. Titusville, site of Mr. Drake\u2019s well, went from 250 residents in 1859 to 10,000 five years later. Pithole was four huts when the boom came in early 1865 and had 50 hotels or rooming houses by the year\u2019s end.Pennsylvania\u2019s current boom is similar, if more modest.\u201cCertainly, no matter how you feel about shale drilling, where it has been concentrated, you can point to some economic benefit,\u201d said Mr. Price, offering the far southwestern corner of Pennsylvania as an example. \u201cGreene County has seen an explosion of R.V. parks, where workers have come to live at least temporarily. In the course of the Great Recession, where the rest of the economy was thrashing around, these communities thrived, but then could be threatened when the drillers moved on.\u201dMr. Price estimates that about 20,000 people work in the fuel-mining industry in Pennsylvania. \u201cIt is a good amount, but only 1 percent of all workers in the state. Nice to have, but it\u2019s not transforming the state\u2019s economy.\u201dDuring the 19th-century boom, the domestic output of crude went from 2,000 barrels in 1859, the year of Mr. Drake\u2019s well, to four million barrels in 1869 and 10 million in 1873.\u201cAround that time, Bradford County had the first billion-dollar field,\u201d said Samuel Slocum, manager of the Penn Brad Oil Museum in Custer City. \u201cThey had drilled 40,000 wells producing 82 percent of world\u2019s oil.\u201cBut then when the electric bulb came around, there was no need for kerosene, and the car had not been invented, so it all just died.\u201dIn any case, said Mr. McCollester, prospectors found bigger deposits in Texas, particularly the 1901 gusher known as Spindletop.\u201cThat signaled the end of the Pennsylvania boom. People just moved on to Texas,\u201d he said. There is still a bit of conventional oil drilling in western Pennsylvania, and the brands Pennzoil and Quaker City are reminders of the state\u2019s past oil glory, but the oil is mostly refined as a lubricant, not the in the larger quantities used for fuel.There has been speculation that the refineries the Pew family built for its huge Sun Oil business in the 19th and early 20th centuries along the Delaware River in and near Philadelphia will be revived. Delta Air Lines has taken over some to refine its own fuel, \u201cbut that is a small business, not more than a few hundred workers,\u201d said Professor Scranton of Rutgers. \u201cStill, oil has a rich history in Pennsylvania, and what is going on now is, in many ways, a smaller version of the past.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Even the Chinese sent help for Nepal\u2019s most recent elections, despite their relative lack of experience and enthusiasm for such endeavors at home.That Nepal\u2019s prime minister, Sushil Koirala, was outside the country when disaster struck was emblematic of the government\u2019s weakened state, particularly since part of the trip was for a doctor\u2019s checkup into whether his cancer remained in remission.On Sunday, Achutraj Subedi, a businessman in the construction industry, lay contorted in pain in a hospital in Katmandu, his spine, skull and left leg battered in a building collapse caused by the earthquake. As his brother-in-law Youraj Sharma tended to him, he said both men knew well that the country was a victim of more than just natural tectonic forces.A woman crying at the feet of her husband's body in Katmandu on Monday before his cremation.\u201cWe\u2019re both in the building business, and people have built buildings without pillars, without iron rods in the concrete and with very loose concrete,\u201d Mr. Sharma said. \u201cHe was on the ground floor of a hotel, meeting with six friends in the business, and the hotel just fell down on them,\u201d Mr. Sharma said.Two of the men died, three others were wounded and one was still missing under the rubble, he said. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t happen, but it did. Like many things we have seen here.\u201d The country has vast hydropower potential, but electricity has long been in such short supply that lights are generally out for up to 14 hours each day in places like Katmandu. Many places have not seen power since the quake hit. Manufacturing has declined for years and now represents a paltry 6 percent of the country\u2019s economy. Poverty is endemic, air pollution is choking, and health statistics are terrible.With few jobs at home, the country\u2019s youths have become part of a modern exodus. The scale of emigration has long astonished development economists, yet it continues to grow. Maps show the landscape of temporary shelters, the epicenter of the earthquake and its aftershocks.On average, about 1,500 Nepalis officially left for temporary jobs abroad each day in the 2014 fiscal year, up from six a day in 1996, according to the Nepali government. Even more are thought to have left unofficially for India; because the border is unchecked, no one knows the precise figure. In some seasons, one-quarter of Nepal\u2019s population may be working beyond the border, economists and labor officials estimate.Almost no other country earns a greater share of its wealth from emigrant workers. That means that just as they are most needed, Nepal\u2019s strongest backs are mostly working in construction projects throughout the Middle East and other parts of Asia. The result is that the remote villages like Ms. Lama\u2019s that were destroyed Saturday are home mostly to the elderly, women and children. Young men are present only in photos, and fund transfers.Experts and historians have long debated the roots of Nepal\u2019s particularly toxic political culture, which, for instance, has stymied the adoption of a constitution for years. Many have concluded that Nepal\u2019s nearly impassable mountains have created such a kaleidoscope of communities that consensus is all but impossible (although Bhutan, with similar geography, has managed to avoid this curse).The earthquake that struck Nepal on April 25 flattened sections of Katmandu\u2019s historic center, where many structures were made with bricks.\u201cI\u2019m hoping this terrible disaster might finally force a political consensus among Nepal\u2019s political elite,\u201d said Shyam Saran, a former Indian ambassador to Nepal.For the moment, India \u2014 Nepal\u2019s giant neighbor \u2014 is at the forefront of relief efforts, and on Sunday India\u2019s foreign secretary, S. Jaishankar, announced that 13 military aircraft were being used to ferry 10 tons of blankets and tents, 22 tons of food and 50 tons of water. India has also sent six helicopters and 10 disaster response teams.The poor state of roads connecting Nepal with India, symbolic of a lack of shared purpose and development efforts, has already hampered evacuation efforts and is bound to crimp relief work.Chris Buckley contributed reporting from Katmandu, Nepal, and Nida Najar and Suhasini Raj from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

We have a primary process that won\u2019t graduate anyone who loves the gays too much but a general election that could, for the first time, punish anyone who loves the gays too little.This is our mission, manifest in semantic loop-de-loops and oratorical gobbledygook from candidates like Scott Walker, who recently reminisced about an unnamed relative\u2019s same-sex nuptials. Observe how he handled that: by making clear that he didn\u2019t go to the ceremony, only to the reception. That\u2019s called having your wedding cake (presumably from a baker with no religious objections) and eating it, too. Also note Ted Cruz. Out of one corner of his routinely scowling mouth, he speaks of a \u201cjihad\u201d by the gays to force even stern Christians like him to endorse same-sex marriage. Out of the other, he says that if one of his daughters came out as a lesbian, no worries!Let\u2019s fill in a bit of background. We here on the Image Rehabilitation Subcommittee, convened after the 2012 defeat and those unfortunate references to immigrant self-deportation, have reached the conclusion that the gay issue poses real peril for the party. And that\u2019s not so much because a recent survey found that as many as 60 percent of Americans now support same-sex marriage. Most of those Americans don\u2019t vote for a candidate based on his or her position on two men or two women tying the knot. Gay marriage isn\u2019t their first priority and possibly not even their fifth.It is about the gays. These Americans grew up with the gays among their favorite television characters and with the gays in the house across the street (the one painted in the neighborhood\u2019s most tasteful color). They had beloved teachers whom they knew to be lesbian. They hang with openly lesbian and gay relatives and best friends. They simply don\u2019t understand discrimination against the gays. And anyone who condones it seems to them callous and hopelessly out of touch, which is why our Grand Old Party needs a measure of Gay Young Party. Maybe two heaping tablespoons. Perhaps even three-quarters of a cup.The political landscape is no longer just pro-gay and anti-gay. There are at least 50 shades of gay acceptance, and it\u2019s important to find the right hue for you.Better to mimic Chris Christie. He\u2019s been dealing with this issue longer than most, because they love the gays in New Jersey. And he has mastered the roll-over-and-play-dead approach, wanly voicing personal qualms about gay marriage while stating on occasion that such resistance is futile. He does pro-gay stuff around the edges of same-sex marriage, so that his message to the gays is this: no filet mignon for you, but how about some tasty veggie and starch sides? I can offer you a crackdown on bullying. Watch me sign a ban on conversion therapy.YOU can also learn from Marco Rubio, a portrait of the candidate as contortionist. He has said, defiantly, that \u201csupporting the definition of marriage as one man and one woman is not anti-gay, it is pro-traditional marriage.\u201d But he has also said, more recently, that he\u2019d go to a friend\u2019s gay wedding in a festive heartbeat, and that he sees homosexuality as ingrained in most cases, not a choice. By asserting that states should ultimately decide on gay marriage, he has elevated local control above personal conviction and thus surrendered to gay nuptials \u2014 sort of \u2014 without actually signing off on them. This particular fudge will become more difficult if the Supreme Court makes same-sex marriage the law of the entire land, but Marco has a better chance of squaring that circle than Rand Paul does.Rand speaks in riddles. Prompt him with \u201cgay marriage\u201d and he muses on \u201cthe neutrality of the law that allows people to have contracts with another.\u201d This was on CNN just two weeks ago. We still haven\u2019t figured out if he was referring to the sale of a used Volvo or the consecration of love.But we also want to win elections, and our coalition is what it is. So we frequently take stands and mutter sentiments that leave them on the side of the road to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Politics is unforgiving that way. And this pink triangulation is a messy, ugly geometry.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unpaid Russian Workers Unite in Protest Against Putin", "Date": "2015-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cDear Putin, V.V.,\u201d the message said. \u201cFour months without pay.\u201dThe protests have been wildcat actions for the most part, as organized labor never emerged as a strong political or economic force in modern Russia. Under the Soviets, labor unions had been essentially incorporated into management.Russian companies tend to avoid laying off workers in a downturn to limit severance payments \u2014 or to evade the wrath of officials trying to minimize unemployment in their districts. So with the Russian economy expected to contract this year and next, many workers are going unpaid or being sent away from their factories for a few days at a time of unwanted \u201cvacations.\u201dUnpaid wages, or wage arrears, an old scourge in Russia, rose on April 1 to 2.9 billion rubles, or about $56 million, according to the Russian statistical service. That is a 15 percent increase over a year earlier, but experts say that still does not capture the scope of the diminished pay of workers involuntarily idled during the slowdown.Discontent over unpaid wages was tamped down for a while by a surge in national pride after the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine a year ago, and by repeated messages on state television that the hardship was an unavoidable price to pay for standing up for Russia\u2019s interests. The strikes, in any case, have not been widely publicized in the state news media.Yet the strikes and protests in the hinterlands, like the huge graffiti addressed to the president, are posing a new challenge to Mr. Putin\u2019s government, which presided over an energy-driven economic expansion for most of the past 15 years.During that time, most high-profile antigovernment protests, including the so-called White Ribbon movement in Moscow in 2011, promulgated political causes rather than economic ones. Those were met with corresponding political measures by the Kremlin, such as arrests and stricter laws on staging rallies. A further chill fell over the liberal political opposition this winter after the assassination of a prominent leader, Boris Y. Nemtsov.But the labor actions are putting forward financial demands, and are being staged in Russian rust belt towns where the government is unlikely to find easy economic solutions to resolve the grievances so long as the recession lasts and oil prices remain low.Regional newspapers described the teachers\u2019 strike this month \u2014 in Zabaikal Province, bordering China \u2014 as the first such labor action by teachers in Russia in years. The strike went ahead even though a regional governor had implored the teachers to work unpaid for patriotic reasons, which suggested some waning of the nationalistic pride over the Crimean annexation.\u201cYes, it is serious when salaries are not paid, but not serious enough not to come to work,\u201d the governor, Konstantin Ilkovsky, had insisted. Mr. Ilkovksy said the federal government had delayed transferring tax revenue to the region, causing the delay in payments.In the Ural Mountains, workers at the Kachkanarsk metallurgical plant that enriches vanadium, a metal used in steel alloys, went on a work-to-rule strike in March over layoffs.In the nearby city of Chelyabinsk, managers at the Chelyabinsk Tractor Factory, which has a rich and storied history as a showcase of industry in the Communist era, sent workers home on mandatory vacations for one day a week, presumably to spend in their apartments in the wintertime.And not far from the Estonian border, automobile workers at a Ford assembly plant went on strike to protest cutbacks brought on by the dismal automotive market in Russia.The actions are in line with economists\u2019 predictions that the recession caused by the Ukraine crisis and falling oil prices will bite Russia hardest in rural areas and single-industry towns.In those places, public-sector employees like teachers and postal workers, whose salaries are capped under austerity measures this year, make up a larger percentage of the population than they do in cities, according to Vladimir Tikhomirov, the chief economist at BCS Financial Group.Russia\u2019s one-factory towns, called monotowns, barely tread water economically in the best of times. After the collapse of the ruble in December, the rising cost of imported parts hurt manufacturers such as automotive assembly plants.\u201cIf they are not laid off, workers could be sent on unpaid vacation because of falling demand,\u201d Mr. Tikhomirov said.The construction worker protest in Siberia was all the more remarkable for coming at a highly prestigious site, the new national space center, the Vostochny Cosmodrome. There, deep in a coniferous forest off a spur of the Trans-Siberian Railway, laborers laid concrete and built gigantic hangars for rockets long after salaries stopped being paid in December.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a kopeck since December,\u201d Anton I. Tyurishev, an engineer, said in a telephone interview. Some people walked away, but he stayed on his job burrowing tunnels through the frozen soil for communications wires near the launchpad, hoping to be paid. \u201cThe company should have laid people off if they didn\u2019t have enough money.\u201dIn all, 1,123 employees of a main subcontractor, the Pacific Bridge-Building Company, have not been paid since December. Most work stopped on March 1, though dozens of employees stayed at the site to guard equipment. Their labor protest took the form of writing the giant message to Mr. Putin on the roofs of their dormitories.In a rare twist for Russia\u2019s unpaid workers, somebody finally noticed this time.After the message appeared, a Russian state television crew showed up to ask the workers to appear on a televised call-in show with Mr. Putin on Thursday. Hours before the show, the general contractor paid about 80 percent of the salaries to the 70 or so employees who remained at the space center, Mr. Tyurishev said. The contractor, Spetsstroy, had earlier paid a portion of back wages for all employees for December.\u201cBecause of the indifference toward us, we just despaired and decided on this original means to appeal directly to you,\u201d Mr. Tyurishev told Mr. Putin on the call-in show, referring to the sign the workers had painted. \u201cSo you saw us and helped in our situation, to resolve our problem.\u201dMr. Putin said he would ensure the whole group was paid in full.\u201cIt is one of the most important construction projects in the country,\u201d he said of the new space center. \u201cNot because I initiated the project, but because the country needs a new launchpad.\u201dBefore the show, a boss had asked the remaining workers to paint over their message, to show that this dispute, at least, was resolved.Mr. Tyurishev said no, not until all the employees had been paid in full. But in a compromise, he agreed to update it to read, \u201cThree months without pay.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Imposes First Mandatory Water Restrictions to Deal With Drought", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHILLIPS, Calif. \u2014 Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday ordered mandatory water use reductions for the first time in California\u2019s history, saying the state\u2019s four-year drought had reached near-crisis proportions after a winter of record-low snowfalls.While the specifics of how this will be accomplished are being left to the water agencies, it is certain that Californians across the state will have to cut back on watering gardens and lawns \u2014 which soak up a vast amount of the water this state uses every day \u2014 as well as washing cars and even taking showers.\u201cPeople should realize we are in a new era,\u201d Mr. Brown said at a news conference here on Wednesday, standing on a patch of brown and green grass that would normally be thick with snow at this time of year. \u201cThe idea of your nice little green lawn getting watered every day, those days are past.\u201dOwners of large farms, who obtain their water from sources outside the local water agencies, will not fall under the 25 percent guideline. State officials noted that many farms had already seen a cutback in their water allocations because of the drought. In addition, the owners of large farms will be required, under the governor\u2019s executive order, to offer detailed reports to state regulators about water use, ideally as a way to highlight incidents of water diversion or waste.Because of this system, state officials said, they did not expect the executive order to result \u2014 at least in the immediate future \u2014 in an increase in farm or food prices.State officials said that they were prepared to enforce punitive measures, including fines, to ensure compliance, but that they were hopeful it would not be necessary to do so. That said, the state had trouble reaching the 20 percent reduction target that Mr. Brown set in January 2014 when he issued a voluntary reduction order as part of declaring a drought emergency. The state water board has the power to impose fines on local water suppliers that fail to meet the reduction targets set by the board over the coming weeks.The governor announced what amounts to a dramatic new chapter in the state\u2019s response to the drought while attending the annual April 1 measuring of the snowpack here in the Sierra Nevada. Snowpacks are critical to the state\u2019s water system: They store water that falls during the wet season, and release it through the summer.In a typical year, the measure in Phillips is around five or six feet, as Frank Gehrke, chief of the California Cooperative Snow Survey Program, indicated by displaying the measuring stick brought out annually. But on Wednesday, Mr. Brown was standing on an utterly dry field after he and Mr. Gehrke went through the motions of measuring a snowpack. State officials said they now expected the statewide snowpack measure to be about 6 percent of normal.Gov. Jerry Brown ordered mandatory water restrictions for the first time in California history. How will water rationing affect you?\u201cWe are standing on dry grass, and we should be standing on five feet of snow,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cWe are in an historic drought.\u201dWater has long been a precious resource in California, the subject of battles pitting farmer against city-dweller and northern communities against southern ones; books and movies have been made about its scarcity and plunder. Water is central to the state\u2019s identity and economy, and a symbol of how wealth and ingenuity have tamed nature: There are golf courses in the deserts of Palm Springs, lush gardens and lawns in Los Angeles, and vast expanses of irrigated fields of farmland throughout the Central Valley.Given that backdrop, any effort to force reductions in water use could be politically contentious, as Mr. Brown himself acknowledged. \u201cThis will be somewhat of a burden \u2014 it\u2019s going to be very difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will say, \u2018What about the farmers?\u2019 Farmers will say, \u2018What about the people who water their lawns?\u2019 \u201dAn interactive map shows how much water California residents conserved in April and how much daily consumption they are being forced to cut under new mandatory restrictions.Within hours of Mr. Brown\u2019s announcement, Representative Kevin McCarthy, the California Republican who is the House majority leader, announced plans to renew efforts in Congress to pass legislation requiring the building of two huge water facilities in the state. The efforts had been blocked by Democrats concerned that the water projects would harm the environment and damage endangered species of fish.\u201cThe current drought in California is devastating,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said. \u201cToday\u2019s order from the governor should not only alarm Californians, but the entire nation should take notice that the most productive agriculture state in the country has entered uncharted territory.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m from the Central Valley, and we know that we cannot conserve or ration our way out of this drought,\u201d he said.The newly mandated 25 percent cut is in relation to total water use in the state in 2013. Cuts will vary from community to community, reflecting that per capita water use reduction has been better in some areas than others. In addition, the state and local governments will offer temporary rebate programs for homeowners who replace dishwashers and washing machines with water-efficient models.Mr. Brown said the state would impose water-use restrictions on golf courses and cemeteries and require that nonpotable water be used on median dividers.Lawns consume much of the water used every year in California, and the executive order calls for the state, working with local governments, to replace 50 million square feet of ornamental turf with planting that consumes less water.The order also instructs water authorities to raise rates on heavy water users. Those pricing systems, intended to reward conservers and punish wasters, are used in some parts of this state and have proved effective, state officials said.Felicia Marcus, the chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board, said that California would leave it to local water providers to decide how to enforce the reductions on homeowners and businesses. She said she anticipated that most of the restrictions would be aimed at the outdoor use of water; many communities have already imposed water restrictions on lawns and gardens, but Ms. Marcus suggested they had not gone far enough.\u201cWe are in a drought unlike one we\u2019ve seen before, and we have to take actions that we haven\u2019t taken before,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not getting the level of effort that the situation clearly warrants.\u201dMark W. Cowin, the director of the California Department of Water Resources, said the state would tightly monitor compliance, in the hope that would be enough to accomplish the 25 percent reduction. If it is not, the order authorizes water suppliers to penalize offenders.\u201cWe are looking for success, not to be punitive,\u201d Mr. Cowin said. \u201cIn the end, if people and communities don\u2019t comply, there will be repercussions, including fines.\u201dAn article on April 2 about a decision in California to impose mandatory water restrictions for the first time misstated the amount of ornamental turf expected to be replaced with plantings that consume less water. It is 50 million square feet, not acres.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Bank Strengthens Its Roots", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial SectionWhile Wall Street banks scramble to stake claims in the booming technology industry, they are finding a smaller one already firmly entrenched.Silicon Valley Bank has maintained a dominant position among start-ups and venture capitalists in one of the most promising and lucrative corners of the United States economy. By the bank\u2019s count, it serves 65 percent of all existing start-ups and many of the most prominent venture capital firms.The bank, which is based in a sprawling campus in the heart of Silicon Valley, used to let its start-up clients \u201cgraduate\u201d to larger banks as they grew. Now, though, Silicon Valley Bank is making every effort to expand its offerings to hold on to hot technology companies like Fitbit and Square.Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s strategy has brought it into increasing competition with the large banks that want a piece of the technology industry. Though Silicon Valley Bank is relatively small \u2014 it has a $40 billion balance sheet, compared to $850 billion for Goldman Sachs \u2014 many analysts say they think the bank will maintain its competitive edge.\u201cThey have the relationships and they understand how to work them,\u201d said Aaron James Deer, an analyst at Sandler O\u2019Neill.The relationships have already been evident in Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s growth over the last few years. Many banks have been suffering through a period of stagnant or low growth, but the loan portfolio at Silicon Valley Bank increased by about 25 percent each of the last three years, and jumped 30 percent in 2014.The bank\u2019s singular exposure to technology leaves it vulnerable if the industry\u2019s explosive growth turns out to be a bubble, as some have warned. The company\u2019s stock fell more than 50 percent after the tech bubble burst in 2001.But there is enough confidence in the continued success of the technology industry that Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s share price has more than doubled from its high before the 2008 financial crisis and is up 85 percent over the last two years. Even with that growth, 13 of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg have a buy rating on the stock.Silicon Valley Bank opened in 1982 as a basic bank for start-ups, and new companies are still at the core of the business model. Start-ups are tough clients for banks because most of them have no revenue at the beginning and do not look like attractive candidates for loans \u2014 the basic business of banking.Silicon Valley Bank has developed a specialty in gauging the creditworthiness of its clients by talking with the venture capitalists who are financing them and carefully monitoring spending.\u201cWe are building relationships that may not pan out for 24 months or even longer,\u201d said the bank\u2019s chief executive, Greg Becker. Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists try to resist Wall Street\u2019s entreaties, but a new relationship has lead to new fund-raising methods.Meyer Malka, the founder of the technology investing firm Ribbit Capital, said that when he opened Ribbit in 2012, there was no question that he would use Silicon Valley Bank, because of its industry expertise.\u201cYou can go to a big bank, but you have to teach them how you are doing your investment,\u201d Mr. Malka said. At Silicon Valley Bank, he said, \u201cthese guys breathe, eat and drink this Kool-Aid every day.\u201dFor Mr. Malka and the entrepreneurs he invests in, Mr. Becker\u2019s bank is also attractive because it is more rooted in the local culture of the industry \u2014 jeans and all.\u201cIt\u2019s a very different vibe out here than it is in New York,\u201d Mr. Deer said. \u201cIf you are a laid-back tech guy, you might be a little ruffled by the hard-charging New Yorker.\u201dThe contrast is visible even in the bank\u2019s cluster of cream-colored two-story office buildings in Santa Clara, Calif., a far cry from the bold skyscrapers where many other banks have their headquarters.All the big banks are building their own offices in Silicon Valley, and stories abound about the Wall Street types flying out and trying to impress the entrepreneurs with freshly bought hoodies and denim jeans \u2014 sometimes with the tags still on.For now, Silicon Valley Bank is not trying to compete with Wall Street on some of the most lucrative investment banking work: helping companies sell stock or bonds. Silicon Valley Bank tried to break into investment banking just as the first tech bubble burst and ended up closing the operation in 2006 after years of lackluster results.Mr. Becker said that his bank did not have immediate plans to return to investment banking, though he said that if it did, the bank was likely to do it on its own rather than acquire an existing investment bank.In the meantime, Silicon Valley Bank has been building the services it can provide to companies as they grow. It has created, essentially from the ground up, a team that can help companies issue large loans that are then sold in pieces \u2014 or syndicated \u2014 to other institutional investors. The syndicated lending division is led by Susan Winter, who previously worked at Barclays and JPMorgan Chase.Silicon Valley Bank has also been expanding the desks where it trades foreign currencies and other financial assets, in large part to serve companies with foreign operations. The bank itself has been expanding its office in London for European start-ups and struck a deal with a bank in Shanghai to finance Chinese entrepreneurs.In a less visible move, Silicon Valley Bank has also shown a willingness to work with start-ups that might scare off other banks. It has, for instance, been essentially the only financial institution in the country willing to work with companies that focus on virtual currencies like Bitcoin.Mr. Becker doesn\u2019t expect this sort of move to pay off soon, but he hopes that it will one day.\u201cThese individuals will want to stick with you \u2014 you were there when they needed you before they became rock stars,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Out of Africa, Kuba Fabrics That Dazzle and Teach", "Date": "2015-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt Review | WestchesterAn intriguing back story enlivens the dazzling designs and astute scholarship on display in \u201cKuba Textiles: Geometry in Form, Space, and Time,\u201d an exhibition of 19th- and early 20th-century African textiles now at the Neuberger Museum of Art.Visitors to the museum first encounter the imposing 18th-century King Mishe miShyaang maMbul \u2014 in the form of a handsome wooden sculpture \u2014 sitting proud and holding a drum. The instrument, like the king\u2019s pedestal, body scarification and coif, is embellished with assorted cowrie-inspired shapes, meander patterns and knot motifs, all embroidered on the splendid array of skirts and replicated in the designs found on belts, belt ornaments and bracelets displayed nearby. The works in the exhibition were made by the Bushoong, one of 18 migratory groups that settled in the Kasai region of Africa during the 17th century. Under the leadership of powerful and highly organized Bushoong kings, these settlers ultimately formed the Kuba kingdom, whose thriving economy was based on the cultivation of the raffia palm. The Kuba processed the plant into building material, wine and, most notably, textiles. The manufacturing of skirts began with plain, coarse cloth made from raffia fiber that had been woven by men on simple wood looms. Women would pound the fabric smooth as linen, and then, working collectively by clan, add their unique repertoire of embroidered appliqu\u00e9, patchwork and cut pile designs. In one of the skirts, a neutral-colored panel creates a hushed exchange between interlocking cut velvet squares and dots. Another skirt, its startling red panel attached at the border with an openwork march of triangles, vibrates with the syncopated rhythm of cubist planes pulsing to and fro. Some of the pieces, densely packed with geometric shapes, meander patterns and loop-ribbon forms, suggest graffiti exploding in a slow-pulse blender. Others consist of circular patterns sparsely appliqu\u00e9d at the top of the cloth and amassed at the base. Kuba embroiderers also created compelling patterns and designs by resist- and tie-dying raffia cloth with indigo and tukula, a red powder extracted from a hard camwood tree. Often used as a cosmetic, tukula can also be formed into a malleable paste that hardens into blackened blocks when fired. Several carved tukula blocks, which were traditionally bestowed as funerary gifts, are among the objects included in the exhibition, along with similarly decorated cosmetic boxes for storing the red powder. Because the originality and craftsmanship of Kuba skirts signified the rank and position of those who wore them, textile makers were encouraged to experiment within a familiar lexicon of patterns and shapes: to tease chance and invent designs unlike those produced by other Central African groups (a visit to the museum\u2019s permanent collection of African art in a nearby gallery is a great way to experience the differences). The superb catalog that accompanies the show explains how Kuba textiles initially left Congo in the baggage of both 19th-century European explorers mining Africa for ivory and rubber, and evangelical missionaries seeking converts. The Kuba\u2019s sharp business instincts facilitated much of this collecting. Realizing the lure of their exquisite wares, they seized on the photographic image as a marketing tool. A cluster of trade card photographs taken from 1913 to 1952 \u2014 themselves valuable collectibles \u2014 portray Kuba royalty in full regalia, dancing and posing for their potential European and American clientele. Collectors responded. Sewing machines followed. A cottage industry now proliferates online. Those who admire Kuba textiles today sometimes joke that the designs \u201clook like Picasso.\u201d As this show makes clear, it was more a matter of Picasso looking at Kuba.An art review in some editions last Sunday about an exhibit on African textiles in Purchase, N.Y., misstated the telephone number for the Neuberger Museum of Art. It is 914-251-6100.\u201cKuba Textiles: Geometry in Form, Space, and Time\u201d runs through June 14 at the Neuberger Museum of Art, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase.

It was the first annual increase since March 2012.The data come amid other signs that the eurozone banking system is finally recovering from a crisis that began in 2008.Bank lending is an essential component of economic growth, and the data will further raise hopes that the eurozone is emerging from a period of slow growth alternating with recession that started in 2009.The central bank has been buying government bonds and other debt using newly created money.

{"Headline": "I.M.F. Warns of Uneven Economic Growth", "Date": "2015-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that continued weak growth in emerging economies would reduce global growth despite an improving outlook in the United States and Europe.The fund highlighted how high levels of debt and fragile banks, in addition to slowing emerging markets, could threaten sustained economic growth.The fund, which for some time has been making the case that the world\u2019s postcrisis recovery remains uneven and fragile, made its most extreme downward growth revisions in large emerging-market economies.Growth forecasts for Brazil, Russia and Mexico were slashed for 2015, with a mix of uncertain politics, weak commodity prices and volatile exchange rates cited as factors.Growth for emerging markets is expected to be 4.3 percent next year, which would make it the fifth consecutive year that activity declined compared with the previous year. Some outliers were cited: India is projected to grow at 7.5 percent this year and next, which would put it ahead of China as the fastest-growing of the large emerging markets.China, once a main driver of global growth, is now expected to grow at 6.8 percent in 2015 and 6.3 percent in 2016, with overheating property markets and questionable loans remaining concerns. Over all, the fund estimates global growth of 3.5 percent this year, increasing to 3.8 percent in 2016.Emerging-market specialists have argued for some time that these economies are diverging. In one sector are the economies that are making economic reforms and benefiting from investor inflows, as in China, India, Indonesia and the Philippines, they say. Then there are the growth laggards, like Brazil and Russia, which have been hampered by governance problems and commodity downturns, they say. Now there are strong signs of increased bank lending and economic activity in Germany, Spain and even Italy, where the policies of the new prime minister, Matteo Renzi, are having a positive effect.With the United States set to grow at 3.1 percent this year and next, the fund said that the large developed economies would need to assume a dominant role in driving global growth. Low interest rates and lower oil prices would help, economists said.The fund said that the dollar\u2019s recent strong run could add half a percent to global growth, with the stimulative effect of weaker currencies in Japan and Europe prevailing over reduced exports in the United States.Still, as equity markets hit new highs, lifted by a wave of large-scale corporate deal making, more economists are coming around to the view that the American economy is strong enough to absorb an expected increase in interest rates this year by the Federal Reserve.\u201cThe U.S. economy is in very good shape,\u201d said Rick Rieder, a senior bond executive at the asset management giant BlackRock, citing the 250,000 jobs the economy has created in some months.Whether Greece can strike a deal with its creditors before running out of money will be a major topic of discussion this week. Many of the main players \u2014 including the Greek and German finance ministers, Mario Draghi of the European Central Bank, and Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who represents European creditors \u2014 will be in town this week.The fund expects Greece to grow at a rate of 2.5 percent this year, a figure most economists see as wildly off the mark. The view now is that it will be lucky to grow at 1 percent this year, as deposits continue to leak from its banks in the face of fears of a messy exit from the eurozone.Advertisement"}

Mr. Greenberg, the former head of the insurance giant American International Group, is suing the government over the terms of A.I.G.\u2019s bailout in 2008, arguing that they were excessively harsh compared with the government\u2019s handling of the bailouts of the big banks.The brinkmanship between Greece and its European lenders seems set to continue on Friday in Riga, Latvia, where finance ministers from the euro area countries will hold their monthly meeting. Greece reached a deal in February to extend its bailout program, but it has failed since then to unblock loans of more than seven billion euros.General Motors, the nation\u2019s largest automaker, will report first quarter earnings on Thursday that should reflect stronger sales in its core North American market so far this year.

{"Headline": "What Greece Faces if It Defaults", "Date": "2015-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday, it is Greece, led by a recently elected populist left-wing party, Syriza, that is contemplating a similarly drastic unilateral declaration of independence from foreign creditors and international financial institutions. Economists like Nouriel Roubini, a professor at New York University, have long argued that \u201cGreece should default and abandon the euro,\u201d using \u201cArgentine-style measures\u201d to prevent \u201ca disorderly fallout.\u201d Far from the sky falling in, they say, Argentina\u2019s economy soon roared back to prosperity; Greece should follow suit.But were the years that followed really so rosy for the people of Argentina?Day 1 of the great experiment was inspiring. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 received adulation when he went before Argentina\u2019s General Confederation of Labor. \u201cI believe in social justice,\u201d the president declared, to ecstatic cheers. \u201cI believe in the revolutionary passion of Mar\u00eda Eva Duarte de Per\u00f3n.\u201d The president invoked Evita, the unofficial saint of Argentina\u2019s descamisados, or \u201cshirtless ones,\u201d to distance himself from the free-market shock doctrine of his Ferrari-driving Peronist predecessor, Carlos Menem, who was president from 1989 to 1999. Mr. Menem privatized state assets and liberalized labor laws, but failed to place any social safety net beneath the growing army of the unemployed when the downturn came.By 2001, the nation was caught in a painful crucible of recession and inflation. To Mr. Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1, reneging on a seemingly insurmountable foreign debt seemed a much better idea than cutting workers\u2019 wages and benefits. It also appealed to Argentines as a rebellious cry of independence from the conditions imposed by foreign lenders.Depositors started protesting inside banks. One man went into a bank with a stick of dynamite, demanding his savings to pay for a medical operation for his seriously ill wife. Soon, most of Argentina\u2019s banks were boarded up with thick wooden panels, on which depositors angrily banged their pots and pans.Well-off Argentines could get around the restrictions. In back rooms, large account holders were able to unofficially withdraw thousands of dollars at a time, or even wire their savings abroad through a growing black market.At makeshift stalls, haircuts were traded for psychoanalysis sessions, apple cakes for clothes. By early 2002, the network of clubs was enrolling tens of thousands of glum-faced members every week. When the supply of pesos dried up because of the bank freeze, some of the biggest of the barter clubs began printing their own currency, the cr\u00e9dito.It may fall to the historians to decide how much of the crash was attributable to Argentina\u2019s defiant default and how much to the irresponsible application of the Menem era free-market reforms. But the price of the default was brutal for those who lost everything, most of them from the lower middle class, who did not have the resources to survive the freeze on bank withdrawals. Many cash-strapped families were forced to sell their homes at ridiculous prices to the better off who still had access to ready money.Greeks would do well to realize what may follow if they back a Syriza-led default and leave the eurozone. They may be stamping their feet for Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras today. Tomorrow, they could be banging their pots in protest.Uki Go\u00f1i, a contributing opinion writer, is the author of \u201cThe Real Odessa: Smuggling the Nazis to Per\u00f3n\u2019s Argentina.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi Jinping Plans to Fund Pakistan", "Date": "2015-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ambitious new development plans center on a network of Chinese rail and road projects linking the port of Gwadar, on the Arabian Sea, with Xinjiang Province in western China. But officials say much of the planned funding, up to $37 billion, would go toward fixing Pakistan\u2019s dilapidated power infrastructure \u2014 an urgent and long-unsolved problem that experts say shaves at least 2 percent off the country\u2019s gross domestic product each year.That influx could be a huge benefit for the ailing Pakistani economy. But security concerns in the region the Chinese transportation corridor would cut through, the violent breakaway province of Baluchistan, hang over the project. As if to emphasize the risk, separatist rebels were accused of staging an attack near the port of Gwadar just before Mr. Xi addressed the Pakistani Parliament in Islamabad.The Chinese government also has its own separatist threat to worry about, posed by ethnic Uighur militants from its western Xinjiang region. Some of those militants have been spotted in Pakistan\u2019s northwestern tribal belt, where international militant groups have long found aid and training.In his speech to the Pakistani Parliament on Tuesday, Mr. Xi significantly and warmly praised Pakistani military operations that targeted Uighur fighters in the tribal region of North Waziristan last year. \u201cThis is something that we shall never forget,\u201d he said.Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, responded with a similarly glowing tone. \u201cPakistan considers China\u2019s security as its own security,\u201d he said.Such gushing sentiments within Pakistan have eluded the United States despite billions of dollars of American aid through the years, reflecting a deep vein of distrust of American intentions by the Pakistani public. Still, Pakistan\u2019s military is currently hoping for congressional approval of a $1 billion list of weapons from American military contractors.For China, a particular area of concern about Pakistan is Baluchistan. The planned economic corridor through the Pakistani province would offer China easier sea access to Africa, South Asia and the Persian Gulf, but the area remains deeply unstable.On Tuesday, separatist Baluch rebels launched attacks on a coastal radar station near Gwadar, the Chinese-run port, and on a security force convoy in the Awaran district of the province.Two soldiers and a militant were killed in the first episode, the local news media reported, and four militants were killed during the ambush, security officials said.The Chinese know well the difficulty of working in Baluchistan.In 2004, three Chinese engineers helping to build the Gwadar port were shot dead in what was seen as one of the first acts of the Baluch insurgency. Later, an additional two Chinese engineers working on a dam project in South Waziristan were kidnapped by the Taliban. One of the hostages was killed in a botched rescue attempt.During Mr. Xi\u2019s visit, Pakistan\u2019s military said it would form a special security division to protect Chinese nationals working on development projects in Pakistan. The military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Asim Saleem Bajwa, said on Twitter that the new unit would involve an army battalion with air support, and that it would be commanded by a two-star general.\u201cSecurity is a challenge for both Pakistan and China,\u201d said Masood Khan, a former Pakistani ambassador to China who heads the Islamabad Institute of Strategic Studies, a research group. \u201cBoth countries have made plans to manage this risk by fighting terrorism and spurring economic development in the affected areas.\u201dRaza Rumi, a fellow at the National Endowment for Democracy in Washington, called the Chinese visit a \u201cdefining moment\u201d for Pakistan. But, he warned, much hinges on Pakistan\u2019s ability to manage the Baluch insurgency.\u201cSooner or later, Pakistan will have to find a political solution to ensure that work planned in Gwadar and Baluchistan proceeds as planned,\u201d he said.Salman Masood reported from Islamabad, and Declan Walsh from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Attract Female Engineers", "Date": "2015-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTHE figures are well known: At Apple 20 percent of tech jobs are held by women and at Google, only 17 percent. A report by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee estimates that nationwide about 14 percent of engineers in the work force are women.As a woman with a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering, I look at those numbers with despair.Why are there so few female engineers? Many reasons have been offered: workplace sexism, a lack of female role models, stereotypes regarding women\u2019s innate technical incompetency, the difficulties of combining tech careers with motherhood. Proposed fixes include mentor programs, student support groups and targeted recruitment efforts. Initiatives have begun at universities and corporations, including Intel\u2019s recent $300 million diversity commitment.But maybe one solution is much simpler, and already obvious. An experience here at the University of California, Berkeley, where I teach, suggests that if the content of the work itself is made more societally meaningful, women will enroll in droves. That applies not only to computer engineering but also to more traditional, equally male-dominated fields like mechanical and chemical engineering. I work at the Blum Center for Developing Economies, which recently began a new program that, without any targeted outreach, achieved 50 percent female enrollment in just one academic year. In the fall of 2014, U.C. Berkeley began offering a new Ph.D. minor in development engineering for students doing thesis work on solutions for low-income communities. Half of the students enrolled in the inaugural class are women. They are designing affordable solutions for clean drinking water, inventing medical diagnostic equipment for neglected tropical diseases and enabling local manufacturing in poor and remote regions. Women seem to be drawn to engineering projects that attempt to achieve societal good. Curious to learn whether that was true at other universities, my colleagues and I contacted the dozens of universities that have programs aimed at reducing global poverty and inequality. What we found was consistent and remarkable.The undergraduate-level international minor for engineers at the University of Michigan reports that 51 percent of its students are women. Those women are predominantly majoring in some of the oldest and most traditional engineering fields \u2014 industrial operations and mechanical and chemical engineering \u2014 where, arguably, gender stereotypes are most entrenched. At the interdisciplinary D-Lab at M.I.T., which focuses on developing \u201ctechnologies that improve the lives of people living in poverty,\u201d 74 percent of over 230 enrolled students this past year were women. This makes the D-Lab one of the few engineering initiatives in the country that has a severalfold higher enrollment of women than men.Arizona State University said that its humanitarian engineering courses and study options have twice as many women as its traditional engineering classes. Comparable programs at the University of Minnesota, Pennsylvania State University and Santa Clara University also report significant increases in the numbers of women participating.The trend is also true for stand-alone classes. Susan Amrose, who teaches a U.C. Berkeley civil and environmental engineering course on design for sustainable communities, counted 128 female and 103 male students since the class began in 2006. \u201cLast fall, we had 70 percent women,\u201d Dr. Amrose noted. \u201cMany of them tell me they are seeking out opportunities to work on technical projects with a strong purpose, such as improving fuel-efficient cookstoves.\u201d Student-driven clubs and programs see the same patterns. At Princeton, the student chapter of Engineers Without Borders has an executive board that is nearly 70 percent female, reflecting the overall club composition. Seventy percent of the university\u2019s student-run Sustainable Engineering and Development Scholars program is also female.None of the programs, clubs and classes were designed with the main goal of appealing to female engineers, and perhaps this is exactly why they are drawing us in. At the core of each of the programs is a focus on engineering that is cutting edge, with an explicit social context and mission.What does all this show? It shows that the key to increasing the number of female engineers may not just be mentorship programs or child care centers, although those are important. It may be about reframing the goals of engineering research and curriculums to be more relevant to societal needs. It is not just about gender equity \u2014 it is about doing better engineering for us all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father-Daughter War", "Date": "2015-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPARIS \u2014 You spend 40 years building a flourishing business and, finally, with age catching up, you hand it over to the only one of your children who has shown pride in your life\u2019s work, understood its importance, and seemed ready to carry on the job. Then, with nary a word to you, she starts to shake up the family firm, offering new products, seeking new markets and undermining everything you believe in. So do you just stand there and do nothing?Not if you\u2019re Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of France\u2019s extreme-right National Front. After spending years grooming the youngest of his three daughters, Marine Le Pen, he handed over the party to her in 2011. But since then, she has abandoned his hard-line positions and the extremist views he has long voiced. In the process, she has won more followers than he ever enjoyed. She is projected to be a top candidate in the 2017 presidential elections, and a threat to the two major parties. Mr. Le Pen, for his part, has decided to strike back against what he clearly sees as betrayal by his own flesh and blood. And if that means undermining his daughter\u2019s political strategy and even threatening the survival of the party, so be it. The National Front was his creation, and he refuses to be silenced.This month, still wearing the mantle of honorary president of the party, Mr. Le Pen gave a series of interviews in which he recycled some of the racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic views that have made him toxic to many French people in the past. \u201cI am not a man to change his opinions or crawl,\u201d he declared. He knew they would upset his daughter. \u201cHis aim is to harm me,\u201d she said.In his latest diatribes, he went from reiterating his opinion that the Holocaust was simply \u201ca detail\u201d in the history of World War II to defending the record of Marshall Philippe P\u00e9tain, the head of the collaborationist regime in Vichy, which deported 75,000 Jews to Nazi death camps.To his well-honed hostility toward Arab immigrants, he added Asians, claiming absurdly that \u201ca million\u201d Chinese now live in France. And turning his guns on France\u2019s Spanish-born prime minister, Manuel Valls, he lamented, \u201cWe are governed at all levels by immigrants and children of immigrants.\u201dMarine Le Pen was shaken. Only four years ago, when she succeeded him, she praised his \u201cserene authority and integrity of thought\u201d and \u201cthe righteousness, the nobility of spirit, the perseverance, the vision and at times the courage with which he led the National Front.\u201d With a prolonged economic slump feeding malaise across France, she has exploited both the unpopularity of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s Socialist government and the squabbling leadership of the center-right Union for a Popular Movement, led by the former president Nicolas Sarkozy, to present herself as a new face and a fresh alternative. And her populist message, focused on the economy, the evils of the European Union and the corruption of traditional parties, has been getting through.In last year\u2019s European Union elections, the National Front came out on top in France, with 26 percent of votes. In departmental elections last month, it placed second, with 25 percent of votes. Recent polls even show that Ms. Le Pen could win the first round of the 2017 election, though probably not a runoff. Still, in just four years, she has moved her party from the periphery to the center of French politics.Now, thanks to her father, the National Front is facing its greatest crisis ever. But like father, like daughter: Ms. Le Pen has come out fighting, dismissing her father as caught \u201cin a spiral between a strategy of scorched earth and political suicide.\u201d She rescinded party backing for his candidacy in southeast France, where he enjoys considerable popularity, in regional elections this fall. She has even begun \u201cdisciplinary procedures\u201d against him in the party\u2019s executive bureau. But will she dare to call on the party\u2019s members to revoke his title of honorary president and expel him from the party? If Mr. Le Pen is afraid, he isn\u2019t showing it. \u201cMarine Le Pen perhaps hopes for my death, that\u2019s possible, but she can\u2019t count on my cooperation,\u201d he said, adding that his expulsion would \u201cimplode\u201d the party.The National Front is already riven by a generational divide. Mr. Le Pen\u2019s traditional support started with French military veterans who were opposed to Algeria\u2019s independence in 1962, along with opponents of immigration and even former Communists who had been displaced from their jobs. He still has a large and loyal following in the party.In contrast, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s young advisers have persuaded her that both the party and her future candidacy can prosper only if she turns her back on what her father has come to represent. Family loyalty, they say, should not trump political opportunity.The battle lines are drawn. Mr. Le Pen has every intention of running in the regional elections, insisting that \u201cI am the lead candidate to kick out the Socialist-Communists.\u201d In that case, he would have to run as a right-wing dissident against his own party\u2019s official candidate. And who might the party nominate to oppose him? None other than his 25-year-old granddaughter, Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen.Could this internecine war bury Marine Le Pen\u2019s dream of one day reaching the presidential palace? Or can she rescue the National Front by demonstrating that her father has lost his marbles? As Shakespeare reminds us, battles for the throne always make for high drama. In this case, the final act is still to come. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Strategy on Climate Change, Part of Global Deal, Is Revealed", "Date": "2015-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House on Tuesday introduced President Obama\u2019s blueprint for cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by nearly a third over the next decade.The United States and China are the world\u2019s two largest greenhouse gas polluters. Mr. Obama said the United States would cut its emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025, while Mr. Xi said that China\u2019s emissions would drop after 2030.Mr. Obama\u2019s new blueprint brings together several domestic initiatives that were already in the works, including freezing construction of new coal-fired power plants, increasing the fuel economy of vehicles and plugging methane leaks from oil and gas production. It is meant to describe how the United States will lead by example and meet its pledge for cutting emissions.But the plan\u2019s reliance on executive authority is an acknowledgment that any proposal to pass climate change legislation would be blocked by the Republican-controlled Congress.At the heart of the plan are ambitious but politically contentious Environmental Protection Agency regulations meant to drastically cut planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions from the nation\u2019s cars and coal-fired power plants. The plan also relies on a speedy timetable, which assumes that Mr. Obama\u2019s administration will issue and begin enacting all such regulations before he leaves office.\u201cWe can achieve this goal using laws that are already on the books, and it will be in place by the time the president leaves office,\u201d said Brian C. Deese, Mr. Obama\u2019s senior adviser on climate change.But the plan has also intensified opposition from Republican lawmakers who object to Mr. Obama\u2019s effort to build a climate change legacy. Republicans have called the rules a \u201cwar on coal\u201d and an abuse of executive authority. Nearly every potential Republican presidential candidate has criticized Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change agenda. The issue is expected to be important in 2016 political campaigns, with Republican candidates vowing to undo Mr. Obama\u2019s E.P.A. regulations.Republican leaders immediately savaged the plan Tuesday and announced their intent to weaken or undo it \u2014 and, by extension, to block the international efforts to reach a climate accord in Paris.\u201cConsidering that two-thirds of the U.S. federal government hasn\u2019t even signed off on the Clean Power Plan and 13 states have already pledged to fight it,\u201d Mr. McConnell continued, \u201cour international partners should proceed with caution before entering into a binding, unattainable deal.\u201dEnvironmental groups praised the plan, particularly the president\u2019s effort to work around Congress.However, environmental groups also said far deeper cuts are necessary beyond 2025 to stave off the most devastating effects of climate change.Republicans also adamantly oppose Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to reach the United Nations accord in Paris. To bypass the Senate \u2014 which would have to ratify United States involvement in a foreign treaty \u2014 Secretary of State John Kerry and other diplomatic officials are working closely with their foreign counterparts to ensure that the Paris deal does not legally qualify as a treaty.Senator Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, has put together legislation intended to nullify Mr. Obama\u2019s international climate change agreements. Republican leaders may try to add that as an amendment to must-pass legislation, like a critical spending measure later this year, to force the hands of Mr. Obama and other Democrats.\u201cJust as we witnessed throughout recent negotiations with Iran and during the previous climate agreement with China, President Obama and his administration act as if Congress has no role in these discussions. That\u2019s just flat-out wrong,\u201d Mr. Blunt said in a written statement.\u201cWe will not stand by and allow the president to unilaterally enact bad energy policies that hurt our nation\u2019s poorest families and young people the most,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ll continue working with my colleagues to ensure Americans\u2019 voices are heard.\u201dTodd D. Stern, the State Department\u2019s chief envoy on climate change, is telling other countries that the elements of Mr. Obama\u2019s plan will stay in place despite Republican opposition.\u201cUndoing the kind of regulation we\u2019re putting in place is very tough,\u201d he said.However, the rules have already come under legal assault. Republicans intend to stress to other nations that the regulations could still fall to legal challenges.There is also growing concern that most other countries have yet to submit similar plans. At a United Nations accord signed in Lima, Peru, in December, countries agreed to submit their plans to one of the organization\u2019s websites by the end of March. Climate policy experts said keeping to that timetable was important, so that each government prepared and analyzed its own domestic climate change plans and those of other nations.But as of Tuesday, only the European Union, Mexico, Norway and Switzerland had done so. Most of the rest of the world\u2019s major polluters \u2014 including China, India, Brazil and Russia \u2014 are not expected to submit plans until at least June, and some expect delays until at least October.The longer countries wait to submit their plans, experts say, the harder it could be to achieve a substantial agreement in December.Advertisement"}

He scrapped plans to become a science teacher and formed a partnership in a Michigan men\u2019s store, later moving to Chicago and then New York, working over the years for Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein. He broke out on his own 15 years ago.Mr. Varvatos\u2019s company now reports annual sales of roughly $250 million and, with this most recent Detroit opening, has 21 stores globally.After waving goodbye to his brothers with a promise to see them at the Red Wings hockey game that night, Mr. Varvatos heads back downtown, where, over a Coney Island hot dog (a Detroit staple) at the restaurant Lafayette, he recalls a trip in January 2014 that made him want to work here once again.\u201cI come back all the time, but on that visit I was just blown away by how quickly everything was changing,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is also this passion for Detroit and a work ethic here that was calling me back.\u201d\u201cSeeing this place last winter made me want to set up some manufacturing here,\u201d Mr. Varvatos says, adding that he may also base some of his new music business in Detroit.Later, at his store, wandering amid the accessories and clothing lines he designs as well as the music memorabilia he collects and sells \u2014 rare vinyl records, vintage audio equipment, classic guitars and live performance photographs of everyone from Aretha Franklin to the White Stripes \u2014 Mr. Varvatos seems pleased with what he has brought to his hometown.Like his store on the Bowery in Manhattan, in the former CBGB, the Detroit space has a stage for performances. And four weeks later, Mr. Varvatos would be back here, this time for the party celebrating the store\u2019s opening, with a show by his longtime friend Alice Cooper, a fellow Detroit native.As the rocker ended the night with his biggest hit, \u201cSchool\u2019s Out,\u201d Mr. Varvatos was next to him on stage, belting out every word and looking perfectly at home.In opening a new store in downtown Detroit, John Varvatos has joined three other retailers playing a key role in the city\u2019s nascent revival.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Shifting MiddleIt\u2019s not only what you have, but how you feel.\u201cMiddle income is not necessarily the same thing as middle class,\u201d said Rakesh Kochhar, a senior research associate at Pew. Even as the proportion of households in the middle-income brackets has narrowed, people\u2019s identification with the middle class remains broad.That\u2019s because the middle-class label is as much about aspirations among Americans as it is about economics. But a perspective that was once characterized by comfort and optimism has increasingly been overlaid with stress and anxiety.Part of the reason has to do with lost jobs and stagnating incomes. At the same time, the psychological frame \u2014 how Americans feel about their security and prospects \u2014 and the sociological \u2014 how they stack up in relation to their parents, friends, neighbors and colleagues \u2014 are just as important as purely economic criteria. And on both these counts, middle-class Americans say they are feeling increasingly vulnerable.\u201cThere is a very big difference between the psychological self-definition of class and anything approaching a useful economic definition of class,\u201d said Richard Reeves, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cPolicy in the end will hinge quite importantly on what you mean when you\u2019re talking about the middle class and who you mean.\u201dAnd that\u2019s the political challenge for Democrats and Republicans looking to inspire voters with policies to address what President Obama calls \u201cmiddle-class economics.\u201d Any appeals have to involve both cents and sensibility.Middle-class anxiety has been driven by several factors: increasing instability in incomes, a sense among many Americans that they are failing to keep up with the gains of previous generations, and an increasing gap between themselves and the very rich.The study, conducted by William R. Emmons and Bryan J. Noeth, found that one reason many Americans viewed themselves as struggling was that their real incomes had not advanced significantly beyond their parents\u2019 even when they reached higher educational levels, while those who matched their parents\u2019 achievements were actually worse off.As J. Bradford DeLong, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, put it: \u201cPeople who thought they were upwardly mobile are finding themselves with no higher real incomes. And people who thought they were sociologically stable are finding themselves poorer.\u201dMoney, of course, provides the wherewithal for acquiring what are considered the traditional bedrocks of a middle-class life: adequate health care, college for the children and retirement savings, generally with a car and a regular summer vacation thrown in.Some version of that basket can be bought across a range of incomes, depending on location. It might include a used Pontiac instead of a late-model Lexus, or a small walk-up instead of a house with a backyard. And even though consumption was once a useful shorthand guide to a middle-class lifestyle, it is no longer as reliable in a world where cellphones and flat-screen TVs are staples in a majority of households below the poverty line and retirement savings, even among top earners, are often treated as a luxury.There isn\u2019t one middle class, but many middle classes. Still, what all of them ultimately require, experts say, is a sense of economic security.\u201cIf there\u2019s no security, there\u2019s no middle class,\u201d said Thomas Hirschl, a sociologist at Cornell and an author of \u201cChasing the American Dream.\u201dThat feeling of security has been eroded by several factors.Median per capita income has basically been flat since 2000, adjusted for inflation. The typical American family makes slightly less than a typical family did 15 years ago. And while many goods have become cheaper or better, the price of three of the biggest middle-class expenditures \u2014 housing, college and health care \u2014 have gone up much faster than the rate of inflation.The types of jobs that pay middle-class wages have shifted since 1980. Fewer of these positions are in male-dominated production occupations, while a greater share are in workplaces more open to women.Equally important, Mr. Hirschl found a high degree of income volatility among most Americans in the four decades between 1969 and 2011. At some point in their working lives, a full 70 percent earned enough to put them in the top fifth of earners, and as many as 30 percent reached the equivalent of $200,000 in 2009 dollars, or roughly the top 4 percent.Similarly, nearly 80 percent at least temporarily plunged into a red zone, where their income dropped near or below the poverty line, or they were compelled to gain access to a social safety net program like food stamps or collect unemployment insurance. More than half of Americans ages 25 to 60 will experience at least one year hovering around the poverty line.For most people, their 20s and 30s have traditionally been the least secure decades, with earning power building to a peak in their 40s and 50s, Mr. Hirschl said. But the recession upended that pattern for many Americans. Older workers experienced an extended bout of unemployment, often followed by a new job at a lower wage.Income volatility has given many people both a taste of life in an upper-income bracket and a bracing slap of instability.\u201cIncome fluidity is a double-edged sword, creating opportunity for many, along with insecurity that this opportunity may end sooner than hoped for,\u201d Mr. Hirschl concluded.What is particularly surprising about the increasing income volatility since the 1970s, said Dan Sichel, an economics professor at Wellesley College, is that it coincided with an unusually stable stint of economic growth that lasted from the mid-1980s until the recession in 2007.\u201cThere was a big increase in the number of people who saw big drops in their income,\u201d Mr. Sichel said.That psychological lens helps explain rising middle-class anxiety. What about the social frame? Here, increasing inequality has helped undermine middle-class security and optimism.The share of the American population that is middle income has been shrinking for several decades. Until fairly recently, that was because more people were entering a higher-income bracket. Now it\u2019s for the opposite reason.Economists and other researchers have repeatedly found that the satisfaction a paycheck brings is related not only to its size, but how it compares to other people\u2019s. That verity is apparently more pointed for middle-income households than for those at the lower and higher end of the spectrum.Yet in the last 15 years, nearly all of the gains in income have streamed toward the upper end of the spectrum.Robert H. Frank, an economist at Cornell University and the author of \u201cThe Winner-Take-All Society,\u201d explains that across most white-collar professions \u2014 whether dentists or sales supervisors \u2014 a very small group at the top is doing spectacularly better even as a great majority is mostly plugging along. \u201cNo matter who you are, whatever group you define yourself in terms of, you\u2019re poorer now in relative terms than you were earlier,\u201d he said.The feeling of comparative deprivation and the ultrarich separating themselves from the rest of society helps explain why only 1 percent of Americans accept the rich or upper-income label. Even most people earning over $250,000 \u2014 the top 5 percent of wage earners \u2014 identify as middle class. There\u2019s always someone wealthier around.\u201cThe gap between you and them is much bigger than it used to be,\u201d Mr. Frank said. \u201cThat\u2019s why people feel more stressed out than they used to.\u201d A Shifting Middle: Articles in this series are focusing\u00a0on the reshaping of the American\u00a0economy and its effects on the\u00a0work force and the middle class.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "C.I.A. Director Says Iran\u2019s Economic Peril Helped Drive Nuclear Deal", "Date": "2015-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt took more than two years, he suggested, for the new president, a former nuclear negotiator himself, to persuade the far more isolated Ayatollah Khamenei that \u201csix years of sanctions had really hit,\u201d and that the economic future imperiled the country\u2019s leadership.During this time, the ayatollah kept referring publicly to Iran\u2019s \u201cresistance economy,\u201d a phrase that resounded among hard-liners who liked to portray the country as thriving by confronting the United States and its allies.Mr. Brennan also suggested that Ayatollah Khamenei, who has not spoken publicly about the accord but has also not permitted hard-liners to speak out against it, had performed a careful political calculation. If the effort to reach an accord collapsed, or the price seemed too high, prominent members of Mr. Rouhani\u2019s government could be blamed, starting with the lead negotiator, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.\u201cI think Khamenei was in the position of being able to say to Rouhani and Zarif, \u2018O.K., see if you can get a deal,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Mr. Brennan, speaking to hundreds of students in an hourlong interview conducted by Graham T. Allison, a Harvard professor and former dean of the school who specializes in nuclear strategy. \u201cBecause if you do, Khamenei is going to be able to derive the benefits from it, and if you don\u2019t get one, Rouhani has Zarif to blame.\u201dMr. Brennan, who like other intelligence officials work to protect their \u201csources and methods,\u201d did not say how the agency knew such details about the supreme leader \u2014 through human spies, electronic intercepts or an analysis of other intelligence.Even so, Mr. Brennan\u2019s views are considered important because President Obama had said in recent days that he had sought an assessment of Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s intentions from the intelligence community, telling Thomas L. Friedman, a columnist for The New York Times, on Saturday that \u201che\u2019s a pretty tough read \u2014 I don\u2019t have great insight beyond what I think I get from our intelligence folks.\u201dWhile Mr. Obama is usually deeply suspicious of intelligence reporting, his relationship with Mr. Brennan has been an especially tight one since the 2008 campaign. In Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, Mr. Brennan was his top intelligence adviser.A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran.The process of getting Iran to negotiate took time, Mr. Brennan said, playing out long after two secret envoys from the Obama administration \u2014 a former deputy secretary of state, William J. Burns, and a former close adviser to Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jake Sullivan \u2014 made the first efforts to draw the Rouhani government into a conversation.\u201cI think over time Rouhani was able to explain to Khamenei just how challenging the economic environment was in Iran right now, and it was destined to go down,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way they were going to address\u201d the problem was to get sanctions lifted.Mr. Brennan\u2019s account contrasted sharply with assessments made by American intelligence officials in 2009, when a much smaller deal with Iran on nuclear production fell apart after negotiations in Geneva and Vienna. At that time, Obama administration officials said the decision to abandon the deal had come from Ayatollah Khamenei himself. They did not say how they knew of his role, but it appeared that they had some capability to monitor his communications, or those of his aides.As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start.Mr. Brennan\u2019s description of Mr. Rouhani as a man who \u201chas a history of engaging with the West, and he is much more practical and reasonable individual,\u201d is bound to inflame the Israeli government. In October 2013, speaking at the United Nations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Mr. Rouhani \u201ca wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, a wolf who thinks he can pull the wool over the eyes of the international community.\u201dIn the same speech he described the Iranian president as a man who \u201cthinks he can have his yellowcake and eat it, too,\u201d referring to the raw uranium ore that can be processed into nuclear fuel.But Mr. Brennan suggested that the provisions of the accord that allow international inspectors to trace Iran\u2019s efforts back to its uranium mills and mines, and track the fuel as it is sent off for processing \u2014 including into yellowcake \u2014 was important to improving intelligence collection about Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities.Mr. Brennan also dismissed as \u201cwholly disingenuous\u201d Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s claim that the framework accord reached last Thursday in Lausanne, Switzerland, would provide Iran with a \u201cpathway to a bomb.\u201dAmerican and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201cWhen I look at the concessions that they made, going from 19,000 centrifuges to 6,000 centrifuges with 5,000 still operating, nobody thought they would do it,\u201d Mr. Brennan said.The C.I.A.\u2019s ability to detect covert nuclear sites has been mixed at best. More than a decade ago it detected, with the help of allies, the large enrichment plant at Natanz. Under the preliminary nuclear agreement, it would be the only site where Iran would be able to enrich uranium, in limited quantities. The agency missed a large underground site called Fordo, which was first detected by Britain and Israel, and it also missed a nearby nuclear reactor in Syria, built by North Korea and bombed by Israel in September 2007.Mr. Brennan expressed confidence that the C.I.A. would be able to build on the international inspections and detect new covert activity, saying \u201cwe\u2019ve gone to school\u201d on Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure.Mr. Brennan hinted he had little expectation that the agreement would change Iran\u2019s behavior in the region, including its sponsorship of terrorism. And he acknowledged that the increased revenue Iran would receive as sanctions are lifted could bolster those efforts.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to lead to a light switch and the Iranians are going to become passive, docile,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the Iran president name in a couple of instances. He is Hassan Rouhani, not Rhouhani.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Colorado, Marijuana Taxes May Have to Be Passed Back", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDENVER \u2014 In the State Capitol, they are calling it Refund Madness.A year after Colorado became the first state to allow recreational marijuana sales, millions of tax dollars are rolling in, dedicated to funding school construction, marijuana education campaigns and armies of marijuana inspectors and regulators. But a legal snarl may force the state to hand that money back to marijuana consumers, growers and the public \u2014 and lawmakers do not want to.The problem is a strict anti-spending provision in the state Constitution that touches every corner of public life, like school funding, state health care, local libraries and road repairs. Technical tripwires in that voter-approved provision, known as the Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights, may require Colorado to refund nearly $60 million in marijuana taxes because the state\u2019s overall revenue estimates ended up being too low when the marijuana tax question was put to voters. Lawmakers are scrambling to figure out a way to keep that money, and they are hoping Colorado voters \u2014 usually stingy when it comes to taxes and spending \u2014 will let them. In rare bipartisan agreement on taxes, legislators are piecing together a bill that would seek voters\u2019 permission to hold on to the marijuana money.\u201cDespite our anti-tax feelings in the state, there\u2019s an exception being made when it comes to marijuana,\u201d said Michael Elliott, the executive director of the Denver-based Marijuana Industry Group, a trade organization that has not taken a position on the refund issue. \u201cThe industry is making a huge economic impact.\u201dBut anti-tax feelings run deep in Colorado, and some anti-tax groups said they would fight any effort to deprive the public of a refund, even if it amounts to only $11 or less a person.\u201cIt should go back to the taxpayers,\u201d said Gregory Golyansky, the president of the Colorado Union of Taxpayers. \u201cWhen government tries to keep the money that rightfully belongs to the taxpayers of Colorado, it is an enormous issue. There should be a tax refund.\u201dSelling, taxing and regulating a federally outlawed drug were never going to be easy for states at the forefront of marijuana legalization. And as Colorado enters its second year of retail marijuana sales, it is confronting a range of unpredictable problems. Among them, two neighboring states and several sheriffs have sued to strike down Colorado\u2019s law, saying that marijuana is flowing out and that the state\u2019s law enforcement officers are looking the other way regarding violations of federal law.But few people in Colorado are pushing to repeal the state law or shut down marijuana sellers. Instead, lawmakers are mostly making incremental tweaks, like ensuring that food stamps cannot be used to buy marijuana, debating changes to the appearance of edible marijuana and pondering what warnings \u2014 if any \u2014 to offer pregnant purchasers.\u201cIt\u2019s the nuts-and-bolts of how do we make the trains run on time now that we\u2019re here,\u201d said Representative Jonathan Singer, a Democrat who has worked extensively on marijuana issues.Distributing marijuana revenue presents a particularly thorny problem. After Colorado and then Washington State became the first in the nation to legalize recreational marijuana for adults, Colorado voters approved a measure levying hefty taxes on the plant and on wholesale bulk marijuana, as well as a 10 percent sales tax. In all, retail customers are paying 30 percent or more in taxes at the register.Voters dedicated $40 million of marijuana revenue to school construction and repairs. Other marijuana revenue goes toward paying for the inspectors, enforcement agents and other costs of running the offices that regulate the substance.While millions are pouring into the state from locals and tourists buying marijuana oils and tinctures, candy and cookies and raw plants, the tax revenue is falling short of the $70 million that the state thought it might collect. Nevertheless, the state is now in the awkward position of having to give back that marijuana money because it collected more than it had anticipated in taxes last year across the board \u2014 including construction, oil and gas and other sections of the state\u2019s booming economy.Blame lies with the Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights, said Tim Hoover, a spokesman for the Colorado Fiscal Institute, which tracks budget issues in the state. He compared the much-derided law to HAL 9000, the sinister computer in the movie \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d\u201cIt has its own malevolent programming that is really hard to override,\u201d he said.The complex measure, first approved by voters in 1992, essentially requires that when Colorado collects more money than it had anticipated, it has to give some back to taxpayers. Refunding nearly $60 million in marijuana money would shortchange school construction and other needs that had been depending on marijuana taxes, and force the state to pay for them from its general fund.\u201cIt\u2019s not that the pot tax came in too high,\u201d said State Senator Pat Steadman, a Democrat who has been trying to write a law that would provide a solution. \u201cIt\u2019s that every other revenue came in high.\u201dThe marijuana refund could amount to a few dollars for each taxpayer, handed out as a break on state returns. But Mr. Steadman said the law was unclear on who, exactly, should be paid back. The marijuana customers? The growers and wholesale businesses paying taxes? The public, who approved this whole setup?\u201cI swear, the more you work on it, the tougher it gets,\u201d Mr. Steadman said. \u201cIt\u2019s really complicated.\u201dHis bill, expected to gather bipartisan support, would kick the question of marijuana refunds back to the public, asking voters whether the state could keep the money.Most marijuana businesses have supported the sales taxes Colorado placed on the substance. But Miguel Lopez, who organizes Denver\u2019s annual 4/20 rally \u2014 intended to be a giant feel-good festival \u2014 said he was sick of what he called high taxes on recreational marijuana. He said they were hurting small stores and helping to keep the black market alive.\u201cWe\u2019re still struggling to survive while losing the economic battle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too high.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Writers Love to Hate the M.F.A.", "Date": "2015-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was peak reading season, and Lan Samantha Chang, director of the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, was gamely juggling a call from a reporter, interruptions from her 7-year-old as well as a 10 percent surge in applications to the University of Iowa\u2019s Master of Fine Arts program in creative writing. Ms. Chang was in the thick of decisions about who would fill 50 spots evenly divided between the fall fiction and poetry workshops.\u201cI\u2019m deluged,\u201d she said, surprised by the number of applications she was sorting through \u2014 1,380 \u2014 especially in a year with a stronger economy, a condition that typically causes graduate school applications, never mind those to fine arts programs, to drop. \u201cI have a tub of manuscripts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird!\u201dPerhaps, she speculates, the surge is a result of the juggernaut HBO series called \u201cGirls,\u201d the one where the neurotic aspiring novelist Hannah Horvath, played by Lena Dunham, takes off to the Iowa cornfields and shines a bright light on the venerated program.More likely, the swell in applications is not so weird.A graduate writing degree, unsurprisingly, turns out a lot of opinionated writing. Sample manifestoes from blogs and chat rooms: \u201cWhy you should hate the creative writing establishment (\u2026as if you needed any more reasons)\u201d and \u201c14 Reasons (Not) to Get an M.F.A. in Creative Writing (and Two Reasons It Might Actually Be Worth It).\u201d In scholarly circles, the boom and its implications have been a subject of heated debate since at least 2009, with the publication of Mark McGurl\u2019s \u201cThe Program Era: Postwar Fiction and the Rise of Creative Writing.\u201d In it, Dr. McGurl, a Stanford English professor, describes the M.F.A. as the single biggest influence on American literature since World War II, noting that most serious writers since then have come out of graduate-school incubators.That\u2019s not necessarily a negative notion, according to Dr. McGurl and Mr. Harbach (who received a $650,000 advance for his first novel, \u201cThe Art of Fielding\u201d). But it seems to trouble many others, especially aspiring novelists and poets. With so many highly tutored creative writers already out there, is success possible without the instruction and literary connections that are cultivated in M.F.A. programs and that a volatile publishing industry \u2014 now evolved around program graduates and sensibilities \u2014 has come to look for and expect?To M.F.A. or not to M.F.A.?\u201cIt is a deadly question,\u201d says the literary critic Anis Shivani, author of the 2011 book \u201cAgainst the Workshop: Provocations, Polemics, Controversies.\u201d \u201cEveryone who wants to be a writer in this country has to confront it, even if you rebel against the M.F.A.,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you do the degree, opportunities open up.\u201d Without it, he warns, you may be able to publish in small presses but are more likely to be \u201ccondemned to obscurity,\u201d particularly if you write literary fiction and poetry. And your writing will change, he says, and not necessarily for the better.Detractors like Mr. Shivani say the degree is responsible for so-called program fiction \u2014 homogenized, over-worskshopped writing void of literary tradition and overly influenced by the mostly upper- and middle-class values and experiences of its students. Others describe an inherently unfair system that all but requires aspiring writers to attend schools many cannot afford or otherwise access. They see a self-generating track to the literary establishment, on which the most fortunate jump to fellowships, writing colonies, agents, publishing deals and professorships, where they are indoctrinated into the status quo.Of course, one doesn\u2019t need an M.F.A. to write. \u201cJust ask Samuel Delany, George R.R. Martin, J.K. Rowling, Colson Whitehead, Hilton Als and Emily St. John Mandel, who is not only M.F.A.-less, she\u2019s B.A.-less,\u201d says Junot D\u00edaz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and M.F.A.-holder who has been a vocal critic of the degree.With so much seemingly working against it, it is astounding the degree has gained traction at all. But there is another argument, and another list \u2014 prominent literary writers and poets with M.F.A.s and a diverse pool of work: Jhumpa Lahiri (Boston University), Phil Klay and Gary Shteyngart (Hunter College), Michael Chabon (University of California, Irvine), Ayana Mathis (Iowa), Jay McInerney (Syracuse University), Saeed Jones (Rutgers) Manuel Mu\u00f1oz (Cornell), Ocean Vuong (New York University), David Foster Wallace (University of Arizona). The list could go on. And on.In an essay in the book \u201cMFA vs. NYC,\u201d George Saunders, a professor in Syracuse\u2019s program, writes that there are so many negative myths about the M.F.A. that they have become clich\u00e9s. \u201cMost critiques I read of creative writing programs or writing in the academy are kicking entities that don\u2019t actually (in my experience) exist.\u201dKaren Russell, whose book \u201cSwamplandia!\u201d was a finalist for the 2012 Pulitzer Prize when she was 29, is similarly inured to the critics. What did Columbia\u2019s M.F.A. program do for her? \u201cBasically everything,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure what I\u2019d be writing now if I hadn\u2019t gone.\u201dSuccess stories like Ms. Russell\u2019s or Mr. Harbach\u2019s fuel the fantasy. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that the promise of the M.F.A. \u2014 to make you, if you\u2019re lucky, a famous, well-paid author \u2014 strikes so many people with even the smallest literary dream as utterly irresistible,\u201d Mr. D\u00edaz says.Other realities conspire to make the M.F.A. one of the fastest growing graduate degrees. Among them: the pervasiveness of digital media and celebrity culture, where anyone with a blog feels like a best-selling novelist-in-waiting; the rise of memoirs, a natural extension of the online selfie writing culture; the popularity of magical realism and noir fiction novels, which have turned many 20-somethings on to literature; and changes in generational attitudes, aspirations and culture.\u201cThe younger generation is making career choices determined by quality of life,\u201d says Jeannine Blackwell, dean-in-residence at the Council of Graduate Schools and a professor at the University of Kentucky. That, she says, goes hand in hand with a focus on reinvigorating urban communities through theater, art installations, food culture and centers for literature and writing.Jean McGarry, a chairwoman of the Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins, says that the teaching of creative writing has taken on even more significance because the way we learn has changed. Evolution in the Hopkins program reflects that. The program started as a one-year Master of Arts and attracted students older than the average 26-year-old in today\u2019s full-residency programs. They were mainly writers with material in need of guidance and derailed by career or family, says Ms. McGarry, who earned an M.A. at the school under John Barth in 1983. Mr. Barth, a National Book Award winner in 1973, called his students \u201cadvanced apprentices.\u201dM.F.A. students today, Ms. McGarry says, are less developed writers; faculty \u201care doing more of the work of writing\u201d for them. She sees that as a reflection of undergraduate education that emphasizes specialization and pre-professionalism, with little room for the arts, reading or writing. Students have come to expect education to be prescriptive, she says. In 2006, Hopkins changed the program to an M.F.A., adding a year because students needed more time to develop.\u201cOur understanding of what it takes to be an artist is geared to an era\u2019s myths,\u201d Ms. McGarry says. What the rise of the M.F.A. tells us about our era\u2019s myths, she says, is that \u201cthe arts are more inculcated than they were before. It\u2019s no longer the genius coming out of the ground fully fledged.\u201d\u2022Every program has its own character. Hopkins is known to be cerebral; Brown, experimental; Boston University, at one year, intense; University of Arkansas, at four years, academic. The best provide a temporary respite from a fast-paced culture unsympathetic to the pursuit of art for art\u2019s sake, and an opportunity to find a community of like-minded people who validate your work and motivations. They allow students to test their stamina (and talent) for what Timothy Donnelly, chairman of the Writing Program at Columbia, calls a \u201cradical lifestyle choice.\u201dThe best also hone technique and train students to read analytically. Ideally, as Mr. Donnelly puts it, students develop an appreciation for the \u201csensuous aspect of language\u201d and the ability to translate their experience of life onto the page. \u201cI look at this very idealistically,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then I think, \u2018Well, let\u2019s roll up our sleeves.\u2019\u2009\u201dCreative writing programs are designed as studio or academic models. Often, programs combine aspects of both. They typically offer fiction and poetry tracks, though \u201ccreative nonfiction\u201d is gaining ground, as are screenwriting and playwriting. Some distinguish themselves by focusing on thematic writing. Antioch University, Los Angeles, has a social justice emphasis; Chatham University in Pittsburgh emphasizes environmental writing; Pratt Institute in New York has social justice and environmental tracks.About a fifth of M.F.A. programs are low-residency \u2014 they meet for about two weeks on campus or some other on-ground spot (New York University, for example, gathers low-residency students in Paris); the rest of the semester is conducted online.Studio programs mimic conservatories and focus exclusively on the writing craft. Academic programs require other coursework, sometimes literature, foreign language or translation courses.At the core of every program is the writing workshop, the so-called Iowa model because it originated there. In its strictest form, it works like this: Classmates evaluate and write detailed comments about students\u2019 work, then sit around a table and \u201cworkshop\u201d the piece. The writer sits silently while classmates comment first on what is working, then go back around to comment on what is not. The instructor weighs in. Only then can the author respond.In the workshop, writing is deconstructed and put back together. Relationships are formed. A skilled instructor can point out flaws and suggest techniques it might otherwise take years to figure out. \u201cYou develop a keener sense of your readers,\u201d Ms. Russell says. \u201cWhen 14 people tell you something isn\u2019t working, you listen.\u201dThe workshop is so central to the experience that programs often screen out applicants who could be problematic. \u201cWe read the personal statement closely,\u201d says Ellen Tremper, chairwoman of Brooklyn College\u2019s English department. \u201cWe try to see if a person seems rational and, frankly, unneurotic, because if you get someone with a screw loose, it can be disruptive to the group.\u201dAchieving workshop harmony can be a challenge. John McNally, an Iowa graduate who based a satirical novel, \u201cAfter the Workshop,\u201d on a washed-up graduate of the Iowa program, has described his own experience there as affected by \u201cbitter jealousies, competition\u201d and writing to please instructors and classmates.Writing can get \u201cworkshopped to death,\u201d Mr. Shivani says. He also points out that criticism is coming primarily from peers who \u201care people who don\u2019t know anything about writing, which is why they are in the program.\u201dThe workshop can take getting used to. David Win-grave, a New York University student, says that at first the camaraderie, the attention on his work and the mounds of feedback were \u201cthrilling.\u201d But it was easy to lose focus and feel frustrated, and he learned to rely on only a few trusted readers.Cornell\u2019s current director, J. Robert Lennon, says that while the program lacked a diverse faculty 23 years ago, half of today\u2019s tenure-track faculty members are \u201cwriters of color\u201d and split evenly between men and women. And, Mr. Lennon notes, Mr. D\u00edaz\u2019s student cohort was \u201c100 percent writers of color,\u201d which Mr. D\u00edaz did not report.\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that Junot had a hard time here; some students do,\u201d Mr. Lennon says. \u201cThe workshop can be a contentious and at times hurtful environment, and I\u2019d imagine that it can be particularly vexing for students who experience discrimination every day outside of class.\u201d\u2022One equalizer has been the availability of more financial aid. Some elite, smaller programs waive tuition and provide a stipend (Hopkins pays $30,000 a year, Cornell $26,000) for every student, typically requiring work in a related position, such as being a teaching assistant. Iowa, Syracuse University, Vanderbilt University, the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan also have fully funded programs.With tuition high for a degree not known for its marketplace potential \u2014 on average $27,600 for a two-year program at a public university, $72,600 at a private \u2014 funding is often the deciding factor in program choice.Financial aid at most M.F.A. programs is likely to be partial, if available at all. Low-residency programs typically offer no grants or T.A. slots.Brooklyn College may seem a bargain at $14,580 in tuition for its two-year program ($20,700, out of state) but the program loses talent to schools that provide full tuition remission and stipends, Ms. Tremper says.The class entering Boston University\u2019s one-year creative writing program this fall will be the first in which all students receive a full tuition waiver and a $12,800 stipend. Before that, says Leslie Epstein, who was the director for 36 years before stepping down last year, it too lost students to schools with better aid packages, prompting it to up its game.But Mr. Epstein and some others in the M.F.A. community get impatient with the discussion of whether it\u2019s worth taking on debt for an M.F.A. Debt is important to consider, he says, but so is passion. \u201cIt\u2019s art! It\u2019s not so bad to make a sacrifice.\u201dStill, there is reality. Few will write the great American novel or, let\u2019s face it, even publish work. In fact, the surge in M.F.A.s has intensified the competition.\u201cWe can only publish so much,\u201d Mr. Harrison says. \u201cI have to sound a cautionary note: M.F.A. programs make money off of people\u2019s dreams. Everyone in the system is implicated. Writers, too. It\u2019s a bit of a house of cards. One hopes people at least understand the odds and how difficult it can be.\u201dIncluding the odds of teaching at college, which many hope to do with the terminal degree. Last year, there were just 112 tenure-track creative writing positions.Many graduates, Ms. Tremper says, are likely to return to \u201cnormal jobs.\u201d If highly motivated, they will try to squeeze in writing in hopes of the big break, and they will struggle. Prospective M.F.A. candidates, she says, need to ask: \u201cAm I prepared for that kind of life?\u201dDavid Wingrave is willing to roll the dice to find out. He is finishing his first novel, will graduate from N.Y.U. in May and will then look for an agent.\u201cBefore,\u201d he says, \u201cI had no contacts in the literary world, no sense of the process a book must go through, no ability to discuss the craft of literature, and on a day-to-day basis, no time to dedicate myself to it. At N.Y.U., I got those things.\u201dAt the same time, he harbors no illusions about the road ahead. \u201cI definitely need employment very soon,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you know of anything?\u201dCecilia Capuzzi Simon teaches writing at American University\u2019s School of Communication.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Paradisiacal Nicaragua, Contemplating a Canal", "Date": "2015-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA view of Volc\u00e1n Concepci\u00f3n, an active stratovolcano on the Isla de Ometepe, from the \u201cChe Guevara\u201d ferry in Lake Nicaragua. If a proposed canal is completed, 55 miles of it would cut across the freshwater lake, potentially making the main source of Nicaragua\u2019s drinking water no longer potable.As the \u201cChe Guevara\u201d ferry lurched with determination across Lake Nicaragua, inching toward Isla de Ometepe, it was difficult to decide where to train your eye. On one end of the island is Volc\u00e1n Concepci\u00f3n, an active stratovolcano whose frequent eruptions leave in their wake neat streams of ash that, when the wind is right, resemble the detritus of a giant smokestack. On the other is Volc\u00e1n Maderas, Concepci\u00f3n\u2019s smaller, lusher cousin.Regardless of where your gaze rests, the $3 ferry ticket (prices are often quoted in dollars in Nicaragua) is a bargain, considering the staggering view: a span of deep blue water bookended by two formidable summits, shrouded in swirling mist.Once you make landfall, the views go from dazzling to engrossing. The countryside at the foot of the volcanoes is blanketed by generous thickets of bougainvillea, poinsettia and hibiscus, palms and banana trees. The volcanoes dominate the roughly 100-square-mile island, though 30,000 mostly agrarian residents who settled there and a perpetual parade of tourists wedge their way in. Islanders ride horseback across grassy fields or herd goats, and young northern European tourists whiz by on mopeds.This pastiche of natural and exotic wonder feels a world away from the bustle of mainland Nicaragua. Ometepe sits amid the largest freshwater lake in Central America, and that is one reason agua (water) is part of the country\u2019s name. The region has been pivotal to Nicaragua, first drawing Spanish settlers, then pirates and then the attention of the British, who sought it as a strategic point in an ultimately unsuccessful military campaign to wrest control from Spain. Mark Twain swooned over Ometepe\u2019s volcanic peaks in his \u201cTravels With Mr. Brown.\u201d Before all this, though, the native N\u00e1huatl who lived around the lake anointed it Cocibolca, or \u201csweet sea.\u201dIn the intervening centuries, Ometepe and Lake Nicaragua have remained a respite from occasional political and military flare-ups. In the civil war that ended 25 years ago, the region saw virtually no combat, since islanders went to the Honduran border or elsewhere on the mainland to fight. The beauty of Ometepe and the vast waters of Lake Nicaragua are two immutable constants that Nicaraguans can rely on.The 172-mile canal would run from Brito, through Lake Nicaragua, to the Caribbean Sea.That is bound to change if Wang Jing, a Chinese billionaire, has his way. A consortium he led won approval last year from the Nicaraguan government to build a canal across the country. The plan, which would connect the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific and shave about 500 miles off the shipping route from New York to Los Angeles, is the realization of a centuries-old dream that has outlasted the construction of the Panama Canal, about 450 miles south of the proposed route.In late December, workers began building access roads for the $50 billion canal. It represented enough of a step forward that it sparked protests. But the future of the project remains in question, not the least because of Lake Nicaragua itself.If the canal is completed, 55 miles of it would cut across the freshwater lake, transforming its bed and local rivers, but could also make this main source of the country\u2019s drinking water no longer potable. This magnificent body of water could very well be both the inspiration that first led explorers dating back to Napoleon to dream up the canal and an obstacle that stands in the way of its construction.I visited Nicaragua in January and went to see Ometepe and the lake, where a good portion of the million-plus international tourists who visit the country every year go. The island is an essential element of a burgeoning eco-tourism industry, one whose selling point is the fact that Nicaragua has 0.01 percent of the world\u2019s land mass but 7 percent of its biodiversity.The Nicaraguan government has yet to commission an environmental impact assessment on the canal plans. The company behind the canal, HK Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Company, or HKND, paid a private British firm, ERM, to do so.Manuel Coronel Kautz, president of Nicaragua\u2019s canal authority, said the country\u2019s leaders have confidence in the reports that have been done. \u201cBoth HKND and ERM are very serious and careful, and the Nicaraguan government has no concerns about the project,\u201d he told me.\u201cAs to the Nicaraguan government conducting a feasibility assessment, which would include cultural, social and environmental impacts, our country does not have the money for this, \u201d he added, noting that the ERM feasibility study would be released by the end of April.With all of this in mind, I wanted to make my own assessment, as a tourist, of what stands to be lost to travelers.Like most visitors, I first saw Lake Nicaragua while traveling through the picturesque, vibrant colonial town of Granada, which sits on its northwest shore. After a jarring ride from Managua on the proverbial chicken bus \u2014 packed to the gills with passengers and crates of crowing roosters \u2014 I walked to the lakeshore, where gentle waves lapped at the wooden docks and the breeze brushed my face.I continued on to the desolate Centro Turistico, a lakefront park, and was gradually accompanied by Santo, a wizened and toothless man on a bike who offered to rent me a kayak as he ushered me along to a shop at the end of the park\u2019s main road. There, I was introduced to Lorenzo, a young man from Las Isletas, an archipelago of more than 300 tiny tropical islands scattered about the northwest edge of the lake.After settling into our kayaks on the beach, we maneuvered across the choppy lake, finally reaching the quiet channels and lagoons of Las Isletas. Lorenzo teased me about bullsharks lurking in the depths \u2014 \u201cfour meters long!\u201d he warned \u2014 though I had read they were practically extinct since 1969, when the Somoza dynasty, which ruled the country for 40 years, built a shark-processing plant in Granada.As we glided through Las Isletas, Lorenzo pointed out kingfishers and warblers swooping into the waters, swallows perched on lily pads and egrets gingerly traversing marshes. He grew excited at the yellow-chested oropendolas, with their ball-shaped nests dangling from tree branches, and then, barely visible in another tree, an iguana glaring down at us. At one point, he silently led me beneath a gargantuan mangrove and pointed with his oar under a limb before dozens of bats set off toward us.As we headed back to Granada, Lorenzo asked me if I knew about the canal. I nodded.\u201cIf it\u2019s built,\u201d he said, \u201cthe waters will go up and they will go down. But either way, we don\u2019t know if we will be able to fish here like we do now.\u201dThe canal project threatens not only Las Isletas\u2019 residents, but also several of Nicaragua\u2019s indigenous communities such as the Rama, Garifuna, Mayanga, Miskitu and Ulwa. The government maintains that the canal would provide an economic boost to a country sorely in need of one, where many earn $1 a day. The canal is expected to provide 25,000 jobs for Nicaraguans, HKND has said, and the Nicaraguan government projects that revenues could lift 400,000 people out of poverty in the next three years.The canal would, of course, also help line the pockets of interests beyond Nicaragua by providing a cheaper route that accommodates the increasingly large ships used to transport goods from the eastern United States to the West Coast, and from Latin America to Asia.Not only would the lake and its immense surrounding habitats be threatened by the required dredging, but the canal\u2019s accompanying development could imperil tropical rain forests, including two reserves (the Indio Maiz Biological Reserve and the Cerro Silva Natural Reserve), Mr. Meyer said.That no independent environmental review of the project has been performed, Mr. Meyer told me, is not only suspect to those concerned with its potential effect but also troublesome for the builders themselves.\u201cTo have an international, independent review will be important if the Chinese hope for World Bank support, or any other type of international money,\u201d he said.One of the habitats standing to lose much is Ometepe, which relies on the lake for irrigation and is home, Mr. Meyer said, to its own unique flora and fauna, including a lungless salamander first discovered and described in just 2008, and Tomocichla tuba, a relatively rare cichlid fish.My guide on Ometepe was Enoc, who first took me to the coffee plantation at Finca Magdalena, leading me later on a hike among the coffee trees that cover the higher slopes of Volc\u00e1n Maderas. Descending the trail, I could hear shrieking. \u201cMonkeys,\u201d Enoc said when he saw my puzzled face. \u201cBut if you want to see them, we\u2019ll have to go off trail.\u201dI followed him through the brush and under barbed-wire fences until we reached a shaded grove, where Enoc motioned for me to be still as he pointed upward at a family of white-faced Capuchin monkeys \u2014 some with babies on their backs \u2014 clinging to the highest branches, their tails leisurely unfurling downward.Afterward, Enoc drove me to a former tobacco and cotton farm now home to the Museo El Ceibo, which I had read exhibits mostly Nicaraguan coins and historical bills. I was initially unenthusiastic, not having much interest in numismatics, but quickly saw how the museum curators had cleverly used the c\u00f3rdoba, Nicaragua\u2019s national currency, to illustrate the dramatic rise and fall of the country\u2019s regimes, in part because every four years, the president gets to redesign it. The exhibit also highlighted the upheaval of wartime inflation, \u201cwhen everyone got to be a millionaire,\u201d Enoc said with an arched brow.From the museum, we drove to the Reserva Charco Verde, where we took the short hiking trail around the lagoon and watched butterflies swerve about, then we headed to the park hotel\u2019s veranda for a late lunch. As we sat at the water\u2019s edge, I asked Enoc about his family, and he told me of his wife and young daughter, and explained that he was building huts on nearby forestland, which he hopes to rent to tourists. It would take some time, he said, as he continued to work as a tour guide.A few days before visiting Ometepe, I flew from Managua in a single-engine Cessna typically used to transport FedEx parcels to the area that would be the potential starting point of the canal. My plan had been to visit Pearl Lagoon, on the Caribbean coast, but as we landed, sheets of rain and heavy wind tossed the plane, and I knew the boat ride there was out of the question. My more immediate problem, however, was reaching Casa Rosa, a fishing lodge outside Bluefields where I had a reservation. A fellow passenger on the plane warned me that the road leading to it swells and floods during such a deluge, and he offered to arrange a jeep to get me out there. En route, we passed shanties and dilapidated Victorian homes enclosed by broad porches, echoes of this once-prosperous Dutch settlement, and also the graceful white and stained-glass Moravian church built by German missionaries in 1849.Rosa met us at the end of the road leading to her sprawling hacienda. Her American husband, Randy, was out at sea, and as she prepared a shrimp lunch for me, I listened to her tales of fishing trips she and Randy had taken around the Caribbean, as she pointed out trophies for prize catches and framed, sun-blotched photos of jumbo tarpon. I was the only guest that evening, and later, after showing me to my modest room, she led me to another down the hall. It was spacious, with a sweeping view of the bay. This is where President Daniel Ortega stays overnight, before heading out on fishing expeditions with Randy, Rosa told me with a wry smile.I woke early to sunny skies and headed for the harbor to board a panga, an outboard-powered fishing boat, for the Pearl Lagoon, but ended up having to wait, inexplicably, two hours before we shoved off. Weighted down with far too many passengers, and mounds of frayed baggage and ice chests packed with beer and food, we zipped through canals and sluices for an hour before I could see a kaleidoscope of thatched-roof bungalows on the shore.Rosa had told me to ask for Casa Ulrich at Pearl Lagoon, and after a local at the harbor pointed me in the right direction, I found the proprietor, Fred, dozing on a hammock. After his wife woke him, and I introduced myself and asked about tours of the area, he looked at his watch and then said that he had bad news for me: The last boat back to Bluefields would be in a few hours, allowing too little time to visit the Pearl Cays, as I\u2019d hoped. But there was the lagoon, Fred told me, and he\u2019d lend me his kayak. After pushing out, I dodged divebombing albatrosses and watched fishing boats and pangas ply the bayous. When I returned to Fred\u2019s pier, he offered me garlic-saut\u00e9ed lobster, chuckling that he hoped he could compensate for the slippery logistics of visiting Pearl Lagoon.As I ate and Fred sipped beer, he pointed across the water at half-constructed stilt huts in anticipation of more tourists. Among the half-dozen canal routes drawn up through the years, he then told me, at least two would have touched the Caribbean just south of here, which could potentially mean more visitors.If you want to imagine what the canal could bring, look no further than Panama, where its canal\u2019s locks are being expanded to increase capacity. Panama City, with its glistening skyscrapers, is a towering reminder of the canal\u2019s significance to world trade. The creation of the Panama Canal predates what we think of as ecotourism, but now that such a thing exists, Panama is known for its biodiversity in some parts. Its Caribbean coast offers surprisingly vibrant sights for scuba divers, and the country is home to 17 national parks. But it isn\u2019t Costa Rica. Its residents didn\u2019t forfeit a massive freshwater lake in exchange for a bustling economy either.Regardless, the prospect of Nicaragua\u2019s canal perhaps provides the best reason to visit the country now, adding drama to what might otherwise be a pretty postcard tour of the tropics. I think of this when I recall my lunch with Enoc on Ometepe, when he pointed to the lake and at the Isla de Quiste, and beyond, two ferries shuttling between the island and the mainland. I took a long moment to absorb the dreamlike view, noticing the particularly tranquil waters stretching toward the horizon.A picture caption last Sunday with the cover article about a proposed canal across Nicaragua misidentified the bird shown. It is an Eastern great egret, not a snowy egret.Advertisement"}

The citizens of poor countries \u2014 including Nepalis, Cambodians and Bangladeshis \u2014 may not aspire to that level of use, which includes a great deal of waste. But they would appreciate assistance from developed nations, and the financial institutions they control, to build up the kind of energy infrastructure that could deliver the comfort and abundance that Americans and Europeans enjoy.Too often, the United States and its allies have said no.This conflict is not merely playing out in the strategic maneuvering of the United States and China as they engage in a struggle for influence on the global stage.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be talking about 10 villages that got power for a light bulb,\u201d said Joyashree Roy, a professor of economics at Jadavpur University in India who was among the leaders of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.\u201cWhat we should be talking about,\u201d she said, \u201cis how the village got a power connection for a cold storage facility or an industrial park.\u201dThe \u201ceco-modernists\u201d propose economic development as an indispensable precondition to preserving the environment. Achieving it requires dropping the goal of \u201csustainable development,\u201d supposedly in harmonious interaction with nature, and replacing it with a strategy to shrink humanity\u2019s footprint by using nature more intensively.\u201cNatural systems will not, as a general rule, be protected or enhanced by the expansion of humankind\u2019s dependence upon them for sustenance and well-being,\u201d they wrote.To mitigate climate change, spare nature and address global poverty requires nothing less, they argue, than \u201cintensifying many human activities \u2014 particularly farming, energy extraction, forestry and settlement \u2014 so that they use less land and interfere less with the natural world.\u201dAs Mr. Shellenberger put it, the world would have a better shot at saving nature \u201cby decoupling from nature rather than coupling with it.\u201d\u201cIf we want the developing world to reach even half our level of development we can\u2019t do it without strategies to intensify production,\u201d said Harvard\u2019s David Keith, a signer of the new manifesto.The eminent Australian conservationist William Laurance, who is not involved with the eco-modernists, put it this way, \u201cWe need to intensify agriculture in places that we have already developed rather than develop new places,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is happening today is much more chaotic.\u201d\u201cBy understanding and promoting these emergent processes, humans have the opportunity to re-wild and re-green the Earth \u2014 even as developing countries achieve modern living standards, and material poverty ends,\u201d the manifesto argues.The new strategy, of course, presents big challenges. Notably, it requires improving the safety of nuclear reactors and bringing down their price. Solar energy at scale requires new energy storage technologies.\u201cDecoupling of human welfare from environmental impacts will require a sustained commitment to technological progress and the continuing evolution of social, economic, and political institutions alongside those changes,\u201d says the manifesto.Until they are developed, poor countries will require access to other forms of energy \u2014 including hydroelectric power from dams, natural gas, perhaps even coal.Even then, it acknowledged its energy problem. \u201cA safe and sustainable energy pathway is crucial to sustainable development,\u201d it stated. \u201cWe have not yet found it.\u201dMaybe enough to power a fridge.Email: eporter@nytimes.com \nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 With their country running desperately low on cash, Greek officials met on Tuesday with the head of the Russian energy giant Gazprom, spurring speculation about a possible multibillion-dollar pipeline deal between Athens and Moscow.Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece met on Tuesday afternoon in Athens with the Gazprom chief, Aleksei B. Miller. The Greek energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, met with Mr. Miller earlier in the day. A spokesman for the energy minister said only that the two discussed \u201cmatters of energy cooperation.\u201d Mr. Tsipras\u2019s office declined to comment.But both Russia and Greece have financial and political reasons for holding such discussions. In Gazprom\u2019s case, it would be an effort to continue seeking an entry point to Europe for natural gas that would bypass pipelines that run through Ukraine, which is now Russia\u2019s enemy.For Greece, a pipeline could in theory generate billions of euros a year in revenue. But shorter term, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government is continuing to signal that it could tilt toward Russia if Greece, which is perilously close to running out of money, cannot reach new terms with its European lenders. Greek officials are to meet with their creditors on Friday in Riga, Latvia.Moscow and Gazprom had been developing plans for several years to build a new western route under the Black Sea \u2014 envisioned initially as running through Bulgaria and known as the South Stream pipeline.The European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive agency, spent years scrutinizing the South Stream plan. The commission did not want South Stream to increase Russia\u2019s dominance of the European gas market. So European officials said that Gazprom would be required to share the pipeline\u2019s capacity with other operators in order to comply with the bloc\u2019s laws fostering competition.More recently, European Union officials feared that Gazprom\u2019s plan to shift the large volumes of gas now routed through Ukraine, piping much of it instead through South Stream, would further weaken Kiev in its struggle with Moscow.As a result of Europe\u2019s resistance, Russia in December said it would shift the planned landing point for the undersea pipeline to Turkey. Russia and Turkey, though, have yet to reach a deal for that plan.Greece gets about three-quarters of its gas from Russia, but for Gazprom, it is a relatively small customer. Even Turkey, despite being the second-largest market for Russian gas in the region after Germany, would not be a big enough buyer on its own for all the gas Gazprom would eventually plan to send through a Black Sea pipeline.On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the European Commission said that any new project between Gazprom and Athens would need to pass European muster.\u201cWe are ready to offer our assessment on any such agreement, any such deal, and its implications when we have something to base our assessment on,\u201d Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, a spokeswoman on energy matters for the European Commission, told a daily news conference. But, she added, \u201cAny pipeline or any other sorts of projects operating in the E.U. area must comply with E.U. legislation.\u201dThe European Commission declined to comment on the expected antitrust case against Gazprom. But that case is expected to focus in part on whether Gazprom is blocking gas flows to some parts of Europe and thwarting customers\u2019 efforts to diversify their supply.The antitrust charges would not directly affect Gazprom\u2019s ability to make a gas deal with Athens, said Mario Mariniello, an antitrust expert with Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cThere would be no legal restriction here, and, besides, I really believe that Vestager wants to act independently of geopolitics,\u201d Mr. Mariniello said, referring to Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner.But other European Union policy makers might be skeptical about letting Gazprom use Greece as a gas gateway to Europe.\u201cThe problems they came across in Bulgaria are more or less the same questions they are going to come upon in Greece,\u201d Trevor Sikorski, a gas analyst at the market research firm Energy Aspects, said about Gazprom. \u201cAs soon as they come into the E.U., they are going to have to comply with the regulatory arrangements of the E.U.\u201dTurkey, in its talks with Russia over the proposed pipeline, has demanded a considerable discount on the price of gas from Russia, and it is a main element in the negotiations, said a Turkish Energy Ministry official who asked not to be identified because of the delicacy of the talks. Other countries like Greece expressing an interest in the project could make the talks run smoother, the official said.\u201cWe consider these talks important because the pipeline project would not work unless European clients sign up for it,\u201d he said.Greek and German news outlets reported recently that Gazprom was considering providing up to 5 billion euros, or $5.38 billion, as an advance for the extension of the so-called Turkish Stream pipeline, which has yet to be built. Greek and Russian officials have declined to comment on those reports.A cash injection could hardly come at a better time for Greece, which is expected to run out of money within weeks unless it gets outside help. But it remains unclear whether Mr. Tsipras is prepared to take the political and geopolitical risks that could come with strengthening ties with Russia. His trip to Moscow this month riled European officials, and Greece will need the forbearance of its European creditors and the International Monetary Fund if it is to survive its latest debt crisis.Even if Greece secured financing from Russia, the future of the pipeline would not be certain, and Athens needs money urgently. The desperate situation of Greece\u2019s finances was highlighted on Monday when the government issued a decree forcing state bodies, with the exception of pension funds, to move their cash reserves to the central bank for the government\u2019s use.Greece\u2019s dwindling financial reserves, and its debt talks with creditors, are expected to be on the agenda at the meeting in Riga on Friday of finance ministers from eurozone countries. Despite Greece\u2019s looming cash crunch and fears about a possible Greek default and exit from the eurozone, European officials have said that they do not expect Friday\u2019s meeting to yield a decision on whether to unlock additional financing.Reporting was contributed by Stanley Reed from London, Andrew Roth from Moscow, Sebnem Arsu from Istanbul and James Kanter from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Health Care Has Been This Quarter\u2019s Elixir for Stock Funds", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe key to success for many stock funds this year has been simple: Buy health care.While the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ended the first quarter up just 0.6 percent, shares of health care companies gained 7 percent, continuing a trend that has been quietly unfolding for years.As a result, some of the best-performing stock funds lately have been those with larger-than-average stakes in pharmaceuticals, biotech, managed care and other medical-related industries that collectively make up around 15 percent of the broad market.\u201cHealth care is probably the area I\u2019ve added the most in since I took over this portfolio a year ago,\u201d says Joseph B. Fath, manager of the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock fund, which has one-fifth of its assets in the sector. The fund soared 6 percent in the first quarter, beating 93 percent of other large growth funds, according to Morningstar.Portfolios that focus exclusively on health care stocks \u2014 especially biotech companies \u2014 posted even better returns. The First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech exchange-traded fund is already up 16 percent since the start of January and 54 percent over the last 12 months.\u201cIn the last four years, the health care sector has been in one of the great stealth sector bull markets I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer for the Leuthold Group, an investment management firm based in Minneapolis.Since March 2011, health care stocks have generated total returns of nearly 150 percent, doubling the gains of the broad market. At the same time, biotech shares have more than quadrupled in value. To some, this rally is beginning to resemble the run that technology stocks enjoyed in the late 1990s, though this sector has received far less attention.What accounts for health care\u2019s resurgence? Money managers cite several developments in recent years.For starters, the wave of patent expirations that plagued big pharmaceutical companies in the 2000s appears to have subsided, allowing the industry\u2019s earnings to stabilize. \u201cOnce pharma started to get healthy, it became easy for portfolio managers to look at biotech,\u201d said Alex Winogradoff, head of health care equities research at TIAA-CREF.BIOTECH has always had a reputation for being high risk. \u201cThese companies always seemed to be raising money but never seemed to generate cash flow,\u201d Mr. Winogradoff said.But that perception is beginning to change, as several big companies, including Amgen, Biogen and Gilead Sciences, \u201care generating enormous amounts of cash flow\u201d and profits, he added.Two of the biggest-selling drugs last year belonged to biotech companies. Humira, which is AbbVie\u2019s autoimmune treatment, generated $12.5 billion in sales in 2014 while Gilead\u2019s relatively new hepatitis C treatment, Sovaldi, brought in $10.3 billion.Gilead is now among the top holdings of Thornburg Value, which recently held 21 percent of its assets in the health care sector.Connor Browne, co-manager of the Thornburg Value fund, noted that it invested in three types of companies: basic value plays, emerging franchises and consistent earners. He said the fund originally invested in Gilead as an emerging franchise, but the stock had since been reclassified as a consistent earner.Over the last five years, the company\u2019s earnings have grown nearly 40 percent annually. As a result, even though the stock has gained 34 percent a year since 2010, Gilead shares trade at a modest price-to-earnings ratio of less than 10 because of those faster-growing profits.Of course, the same can\u2019t be said for the entire health care sector.Robert S. Burnstine, co-manager of the Aston/Fairpointe Focused Equity fund, said, \u201cThree years ago, health care was a great place to be.\u201dBack then, he said, 27 percent of his portfolio was held in the sector, and those health care stocks traded at an average P/E ratio of about 13, based on forecast forward 12-month earnings.But \u201chealth care prices generally aren\u2019t cheap anymore,\u201d Mr. Burnstine noted.Today he keeps only about 15 percent of his fund\u2019s assets in health stocks, and the shares he owns have a projected P/E of about 18.This reflects a similar trend in the broader health care universe. Medical stocks in the S.&P. 500 currently trade at an average P/E of 18.8, according to Bloomberg, versus 17.7 for the broad market.Mr. Browne agrees that \u201con an absolute basis, we\u2019re getting up there in terms of valuation levels.\u201d However, relative to other non-economically sensitive areas of the market, \u201cvaluations look cheaper while growth opportunities look better,\u201d he said.Shares of consumer staples companies \u2014 makers of basic household goods like toothpaste and soap \u2014 trade at an average P/E ratio of 20. Yet consumer sector earnings are expected to grow 7 percent annually over the next three to five years, versus nearly 10 percent for health care.Michael S. Tung, co-manager of the Turner Medical Sciences Long/Short fund, said \u201cthere\u2019s still value to be found in health care.\u201d He points to areas such as the specialty pharmaceutical business, where mergers and acquisitions are heating up.He cautions, though, that valuations are significantly higher among small biotechnology stocks. \u201cSome of the valuations are absolutely obscene,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these companies are being priced as if every drug is going to get approved.\u201dStill, many investors think health care\u2019s run can keep going, at least in the short term.The low-interest-rate environment continues to drive an M.&A. boom in this sector, driven by aggressive cost-cutters like Valeant Pharmaceuticals International.Until acquisitions and earnings growth subside \u2014 or until another sector of the economy excites Wall Street enough to start absorbing all the new money heading into health care \u2014 this rally is likely to keep going, Mr. Winogradoff of TIAA-CREF said.\u201cFundamentally,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are probably in the sixth inning of a nine-inning game.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror,\u2019 and More", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA masked militant with a drawn knife, preparing to slaughter a helpless captive: This is how the group that was to become the Islamic State, more commonly known as ISIS, grabbed the world\u2019s attention in 2004. The Islamic State has renamed and reinvented itself many times since then, but it still makes such scenes a staple of its propaganda.\u201cOne who previously engaged in jihad knows that it is naught but violence, crudeness, terrorism, deterrence and massacring,\u201d Abu Bakr Naji wrote in \u201cThe Management of Savagery,\u201d the group\u2019s key theoretical work. Other forces in the Middle East, like Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria, can be just as brutal. But they try to conceal their brutality, while the Islamic State revels in its. Just as unusually, the Islamic State and its predecessors always seem to be seeking out new enemies. It bombed Iraq\u2019s Shia majority while fighting an American occupation in 2004, and it killed Americans in 2014 to draw the United States into a war the Islamic State was already waging on many fronts: against the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad, the Alawite-dominated regime in Damascus, Syrian and Iraqi Kurds, and other Sunni rebels.Making so many enemies, and giving them so much motivation to fight, might seem self-defeating. Even Al Qaeda, the Islamic State\u2019s patron-turned-rival, balks at its blood lust. But depressingly, its extremism appears to work: The Islamic State has eclipsed dozens of rival insurgent groups that at first glance look to be more deeply rooted in their societies; routed armies many times its size; and taken on every power in the region, from the United States to Iran to Al Qaeda, holding its own against all of them. Of these three new books on the Islamic State, only one quotes Yeats\u2019s \u201cThe Second Coming,\u201d but the others must have been tempted. Why must the \u201cworst\u201d \u2014 the most wantonly cruel \u2014 elicit the most passionate intensity?These books each highlight different aspects of the group\u2019s success. \u201cISIS: Inside the Army of Terror,\u201d by Michael Weiss and Hassan Hassan, the most comprehensive of the three, traces the group\u2019s evolution and sheds particular light on how it both cows and co-opts the populations in the areas it controls. \u201cISIS: The State of Terror,\u201d by Jessica Stern and J.\u2009M. Berger, is heavily focused on its online presence. Patrick Cockburn\u2019s \u201cThe Rise of Islamic State\u201d is a more argumentative work, centered on how errors made by ISIS\u2019 foes paved its way.Taken together, the books show that the Islamic State\u2019s strategy can be remarkably sophisticated. It portrays itself as eager to rush in at the slightest sign of unbelief in order to cut throats, but in fact it has a more subtle and long-term design. The phrase \u201cmanagement of savagery,\u201d which could be read as how to exploit terror, actually refers to something else: how to break down \u201capostate\u201d regimes so that Muslim regions fall into a state of \u201csavagery,\u201d and then build a new order on top. The cruelty and the willingness to make enemies are necessary elements in both the breaking down and the building up, but they are only part of the equation.Stern, a lecturer on terrorism at Harvard, and Berger, a nonresident fellow with the Brookings Institution, dissect the Islamic State\u2019s messaging in some detail, showing how the cruelty is aimed at recruiting a very specific demographic, \u201cangry, maladjusted young men\u201d attracted to a total war against unbelief. The Islamic State also chooses its foes and battles so that it appears to be fulfilling Islamic End Times prophecies. Only a tiny percentage of the world\u2019s Muslims may be receptive to such a message, but the Islamic State\u2019s social media tactics reach so large an audience that the payoff is huge: Nearly 20,000 foreign volunteers have come to join jihadist groups in Iraq and Syria, according to one study cited by Stern and Berger.The authors contrast the Islamic State\u2019s messaging with Al Qaeda\u2019s, and show why ISIS has ultimately been more successful. Al Qaeda may look down on its rival\u2019s crudity, but ultimately, Stern and Berger argue, its worldview is more na\u00efve and \u201cnihilistic.\u201d They locate Al Qaeda in the (mostly leftist) tradition of vanguard revolutionary movements that hope to awaken the masses via dramatic acts, but then take for granted that the masses will instinctively know what to do next. The Islamic State, rather than expecting radicalized Muslims to engage in spontaneous acts of resistance throughout the world, wants them where it can guide them closely: in its newly proclaimed caliphate. It intersperses beheading footage with images of pothole repair, clinics and apparently grateful civilians. Al Qaeda offers its followers martyrdom. Its caliphate won\u2019t come into existence for generations. ISIS offers them a place in its nascent utopia today.Weiss, a columnist for Foreign Policy, and Hassan, an analyst at the Delma Institute, a research center in Abu Dhabi, provide a detailed explanation of how the Islamic State \u201cmanages savagery\u201d on the ground. They trace the group\u2019s full history \u2014 how the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi made his way, from Afghanistan and Iran, to Iraq; how his \u201cMonotheism and Holy War\u201d movement exploited the security vacuum created by the American invasion to build his organization; how it established its mystique by plunging into key battles and federating with Al Qaeda; how it sparked a sectarian war with the Shia; how it antagonized powerful Sunni tribes and was brought to near extinction by the American-backed Sahwa (\u201cAwakening\u201d) movement; how it surged forward as Iran-backed Shia leaders who considered the Sahwa a threat persecuted Sunnis until they rebelled.This account of the Islamic State in Iraq is a valuable summation, but it really shines when it reaches the group\u2019s entry into Syria starting in 2011. Weiss and Hassan use their own interviews with members to draw out the range of motivations for why Syrians join such an extreme organization. Scholars may scoff at the group\u2019s interpretation of Islam, but some Syrians appear to have been genuinely persuaded by the Islamic State\u2019s theological arguments. Others have been disenchanted with less disciplined rebel movements, or decided that only ISIS could protect Syrian Sunnis from Shia or Kurdish aggression.\u201cISIS: Inside the Army of Terror\u201d shows how the Islamic State, despite its \u00ad\u201cbarbarians at the gate\u201d self-image, is quite capable of picking its battles. Weiss and Hassan argue that tacit understandings with the Assad regime in particular helped the group expand. During the American occupation of Iraq, Damascus let militants transit through its territory to join the battle, which both kept the jihadists busy and dampened American enthusiasm for regional regime change. After the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, Weiss and Hassan argue, Assad \u2014 who claimed from the beginning that the rebels were predominantly extremists \u2014 rallied non-Sunnis to his regime and reduced Western enthusiasm for his overthrow. Weiss and Hassan are not the first to make this observation, but they effectively lay out the evidence, including a mass amnesty for imprisoned militants and the Assad air force\u2019s reluctance to hit ISIS targets.Weiss and Hassan also show that the Islamic State learned from the backlash against it by tribes in Iraq. The group\u2019s hostility to an economy based on patronage brought it into conflict with those tribes, so the Syrian branch now allows tribes to keep concessions in smuggling and other economic activity. But today\u2019s Islamic State is just as heavy-handed as its earlier incarnation in its rigid enforcement of Shariah law, and its insistence on being the sole arbiter of disputes between tribes. This strategy might have led to resentment, but as things turned out, tribes valued its ability to keep order and curb banditry. Here, the Islamic State\u2019s bloodthirstiness has proved an asset: The group\u2019s enthusiasm for capital punishment extends to its own members if they are accused of corruption, allowing it to impose more discipline on its members than on less radical rebels. Its huge foreign contingent is also valuable, since those individuals can serve as impartial moderators and, if needed, be quickly deployed for shows of force.Weiss and Hassan expect readers to know the general outline of the events they cover. Their book jumps from point to point and sometimes hangs sweeping assessments on a single analyst; it could use a lot more footnotes for its debatable assertions. But as the most serious book-length study of the Islamic State to be published so far, it may serve as the basis for a more definitive account of the group in the future.Patrick Cockburn\u2019s work is the most accessible but least detailed of the three. His account focuses on the miscalculations of the Islamic State\u2019s foes. The United States is blamed not only for its original sin of having invaded Iraq but also for mishandling the Syria war. Washington assumed that Assad would go down to defeat and had no Plan B when he did not, nor did it grasp that a war in Syria would in time destabilize Iraq. Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, simultaneously backed the Sunnis into a corner while feeding a culture of corruption that left his military unable to handle the ensuing rebellion. Saudi Arabia funneled money to Syrian jihadis at the same time that its preachers railed against the Shia, ensuring a sectarian nightmare. Assad, for his part, overlooked the seeds of Syria\u2019s uprising, then overestimated his security \u00adforces\u2019 ability to keep it in check through brute coercion.Cockburn, an experienced Mideast journalist, relies heavily on his own reporting. He offers revealing anecdotes on the decrepit state of the Iraqi Army, which collapsed before the Islamic State\u2019s Mosul offensive, and some glimpses of the sluggish and brutal military stalemate in Syria. But his book does little to explain why the Islamic State, rather than its Sunni rivals, managed to seize the opportunities offered by its foes. Cockburn describes a continuing tragedy in which hubris and optimism destroyed a seemingly promising revolution, but few insights into the inner workings of the extremists who came out on top.Were post-hussein Iraq and Assad\u2019s Syria doomed to sink into the \u201csavagery\u201d that the Islamic State was poised to exploit? And is there any way out? Cockburn is unremittingly pessimistic, suggesting that the two countries may be finished as unified states. Weiss and Hassan, by stressing the role played by the Assad regime in the Islamic State\u2019s rise, seem anxious to absolve Syria\u2019s revolution of having led inexorably to extremism. But they are gloomy about the future: They do not see American bombing as having seriously shaken ISIS\u2019 hold. Meanwhile, the group has taken steps to forestall a new Sahwa. Stern and Berger, with their emphasis on information technology, imply that the Islamic State is as much a consequence of its time as of its place: It cornered a niche market with a message of ultraviolence. But the authors hold out the hope that if the Islamic State is contained, it may rot under the burden of its inflated expectations.The Islamic State\u2019s defeat by Kurdish fighters and American air power at Kobane, and Baghdad\u2019s assault on Tikrit, suggest that its days of easy victories may be coming to an end. If it is deprived of those, its mystique and ability to attract foreign recruits may wane. But at the same time, the group is metastasizing, with local groups in Egypt, Libya and most recently Nigeria pledging allegiance. Insofar as it can find new savagery to manage, the Islamic State may be with us for a long time.ISISInside the Army of TerrorBy Michael Weiss and Hassan Hassan270 pp. Regan Arts.

{"Headline": "Everest Climbers Are Killed as Nepal Quake Sets Off Avalanche", "Date": "2015-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by6 PhotosIn last year\u2019s accident, no foreign climbers were killed, partly because of the early hour. The climbers were Sherpas, members of an ethnic group known for their climbing acumen and who often use Sherpa as a surname. They are paid by foreign climbers to do the dangerous tasks of fixing ropes, carrying supplies and setting up camps.The earthquake that occurred near Katmandu, Nepal, touched off avalanches on Mount Everest causing injury and death during prime climbing season.In the video, he points to a mountain visible behind him and says there have been a few avalanches in the area, as well as rockfalls. Most climbers on his team were fine, he said, but he had not yet heard from climbers who moved to other camps.Ang Sherpa, an experienced guide, said in an interview on Saturday that about 800 people were already staying at the Everest base camp, which is always a somewhat chaotic collection of tents, equipment and exhausted climbers and their attendants. A helicopter rescue operation to the base camp was planned for Sunday morning, he said, when a full tally of the dead and injured should become available.Tourism accounts for much of Nepal\u2019s economy, with Everest one of the country\u2019s biggest draws. And though money generated by people who climb the celebrated peak constitutes only a relatively small part of the country\u2019s overall economy, it represents one of the few ways men can earn a living in Nepal.Foreign climbers pay professional tour companies and Western guides as much as $100,000 to climb, with assistance, the 29,000-foot (8,848 meters) peak. Sherpas are hired at about $125 per climb per legal load (set at 20 pounds) to ease paying climbers\u2019 path up the mountain. The tour agencies pay several thousand dollars per climber to the Nepalese government for a climbing license, and those fees have brought the government $3 million to $4 million annually in recent years. There is also the money to the local economy for hotels, dining and cellphone rentals, as well as the hiring of local help to carry trekkers\u2019 supplies.Ang Sherpa said he was certain that climbing would soon resume, but with the Katmandu airport shuttered after the earthquake and the entire country paralyzed, such a prediction might be premature.Though some climbers have little or no mountaineering experience, with good weather, dozens sometimes reach the summit in a single day.But limited oxygen and sudden changes in weather that can plunge climbers into blinding snowstorms and brutally cold conditions have claimed hundreds over the years, with the bodies of some of the dead remaining frozen in place for years.Bhadra Sharma contributed reporting from Katmandu, Nepal, and Conor Dougherty from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Main Syria-Jordan Crossing Under Insurgent Assault", "Date": "2015-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAMMAN, Jordan \u2014 The main border crossing between Syria and Jordan remained closed and chaotic on Friday, with insurgents \u2014 including the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda\u2019s branch in Syria, and Western-backed rebel factions \u2014 wrangling for control two days after they seized and looted the crucial gateway.The power struggle at the Nasib crossing, coupled with Syrian government airstrikes that hit nearby on Thursday, is the latest cross-border spillover from Syria\u2019s four-year war, and it has led to new tensions between Jordan and Syria. Adding to the chaos, at least 10 Lebanese truck drivers were being held by Nusra, Lebanon\u2019s minister for the economy, Alain Hakim, told Lebanon\u2019s Daily Star newspaper, and witnesses said as many as 22 were being held either for ransom or as bargaining chips. Jordan\u2019s interior minister, Hussein Majali, said the border would remain closed indefinitely until the authorities could guarantee security there.The chaos on the border was a blow to Syria\u2019s government, which lost the last crossing it had still controlled along the 230-mile border. But it could also be embarrassing for Jordan, the United States and other allies involved in a covert program to train insurgents who, they insist, are relatively nationalist and moderate.Those fighters, calling themselves the Free Syrian Army, work out of an operations room in Jordan and receive some assistance from the United States, which lists Nusra as a terrorist organization. But in practice, they often cooperate on the battlefield.Asaad al-Zoubi, a former Syrian Army officer and the Free Syrian Army\u2019s coordinator for the southern front, admitted in an interview that some members of army-affiliated battalions had taken part in the looting, but he insisted that they had not coordinated with Nusra.\u201cI admit there was chaos and looting even by members of the Free Syrian Army, but we are working on returning some of the stolen goods and equipment,\u201d Mr. Zoubi said Friday.He said that factions linked to the Free Syrian Army had seized the border crossing without Nusra fighters, who rushed in later to take credit. Antigovernment activists in the area have said that a deal was made with Nusra to remain in the background.Videos on social media sites showed various groups celebrating the crossing\u2019s seizure, including Nusra as well as groups linked to the Free Syrian Army. Other videos showed men unloading trucks and cars and speeding away with goods.\u201cI was shocked \u2014 the building is completely empty,\u201d said Ammar, an antigovernment activist, after visiting the area. \u201cThere are no more tables, computers, cables. They even looted the tiles and the plugs. This is the people\u2019s property.\u201dHe added: \u201cAfter the liberation I was so happy, but after I saw this I wish the place were still with the regime. The building was like a pretty woman who suddenly aged.\u201dAfter a second visit on Friday, he said Nusra and Free Syrian Army groups were controlling different parts of the complex, with a Free Syrian Army group called the Southern Falcons objecting to Nusra\u2019s efforts to seize control of the crossing and its spoils. He said a Nusra fighter told him they were holding 22 drivers, not for ransom, but as a way to put pressure on the Free Syrian Army \u201cto let Nusra run the whole place.\u201dHwaida Saad, Maher Samaan and Anne Barnard contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy's Famous Ghost Resort", "Date": "2015-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALAU, Italy \u2014 The huge, futuristic resort sits nestled in La Maddalena National Park, one of the most ravishingly beautiful corners of the Mediterranean, where topaz-tinted waves wash the juniper-studded granite of a scattering of tiny islands off Sardinia\u2019s northeast coast. The resort\u2019s cost: 470 million euros, or about $506 million. Handover from the developer to the Italian government: 2009. Intended purpose: hosting the Group of 8 summit meeting of leading industrial nations. Actual use: None. Nearly six years on, the fully fitted glass-and-metal buildings are rusting quietly in the mistral, a cold, gusting wind that come down from France. Not that those responsible feel any need to offer any explanation. There is a conviction, in Italy as elsewhere, that major events leave a heritage of waste and cathedrals in the desert. That was what happened after the 2004 Athens Olympics, where sky-high costs helped to sink Greece\u2019s public finances. Up to a point, the same scene unfolded in the wake of the 2010 soccer World Cup in South Africa. It\u2019s happening after the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, a mirror held up to Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s dreams of grandeur. The Maddalena fiasco isn\u2019t as spectacular, or as expensive, as any of these, but it is more bizarre. Olympic games actually took place in Athens and Sochi. South Africa saw genuine soccer matches. But the Maddalena archipelago \u2014 where Napoleon suffered his first defeat and Giuseppe Garibaldi lived for a time, a father of modern Italy an exile in his homeland \u2014 is haunted only by the shadows of a summit meeting that never took place: At the last minute, Italy shifted it to the mainland. Sardinia, the Mediterranean\u2019s second-largest island, suffers a youth unemployment rate of more than 50 percent. It is economically and geographically isolated, and its petrochemical and metallurgical industries, the twin engines of the local economy, have been shutting down. Sardinia could have done much with the frittered millions. According to the island government\u2019s 2015 spending, \u20ac470 million would have covered its education, employment, tourism, arts and sports budgets.The Maddalena fiasco began in the early 2000s, when the American military began sending signals it would close its base on Santo Stefano, a part of the Maddalena archipelago. The base was opened after a 1972 agreement between Italy and the United States. When it finally shuttered, in 2008, the NATO munitions facility there vanished, and with it an American nuclear submarine facility. In an area with few sources of income except summer vacationers, the American armed forces were a lifeline. Facing the looming closure, in 2006 Prime Minister Romano Prodi\u2019s government found a spectacular solution to La Maddalena\u2019s ills: holding the Group of 8 meeting on the site of the former naval base. By 2008, however, Silvio Berlusconi was in power and blowing distinctly cool on the project. Work went ahead anyway. What took shape was a luxury resort that, at least in theory, would give post-Group of 8 tourism in Sardinia a shot in the arm. Then on April 6, 2009, an earthquake struck Italy\u2019s Abruzzo region, devastating the regional capital, L\u2019Aquila. Mr. Berlusconi stepped in to make a spectacular gesture of his own, at nearly the last minute transferring the Group of 8 summit meeting to the tremor-ravaged central Italian city. A questionable decision, albeit one that yielded plenty of photo opportunities for Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and other world leaders. That was over five years ago. Aside from the summit meeting, nothing much has happened in L\u2019Aquila. Today, most of its historic center is still unsafe. Meanwhile, La Maddalena\u2019s glass and steel citadel gazes out to sea unused. Both sites have been devastated by neglect, poor planning, corruption and courtroom squabbles. But the scene at La Maddalena is more depressing. Taking cover behind the excuse of urgency, the government allowed costs to balloon. Mita Resort, the structure\u2019s management company, complains that the sea has not been cleaned up and La Maddalena is not attracting wealthy tourists. Neither is it clear who has overall responsibility for the complex. The regional authority has no money, the national government has no time, and private investors have no ideas.Italy is now set to host Expo 2015, which opens May 1 in Milan. The theme is feeding the planet. Some 6,000 workers are toiling round the clock to get things finished. The construction involved more than 8.8 million cubic feet of concrete, more than 2.8 million cubic feet of timber and 77,000 tons of steel. Authorities expect 20 million visitors. The expo\u2019s millions of square feet will host pavilions displaying exhibitions from 145 countries. It is a magnificent project that Italy will surely carry through. But let\u2019s not forget La Maddalena. Fiascos contain lessons, if you look for them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Adviser During Recession Is Given New Challenge: Climate Change", "Date": "2015-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrian Deese\u2019s first job at the White House included churning out economic doomsday scenarios, like how many communities might see unemployment rates hit 25 percent in the event of cascading bankruptcies across the Midwest.These days the crisis atmosphere is gone and unemployment is at 5.5 percent, but Mr. Deese is still running the economic numbers at the White House on a different kind of crisis that is preoccupying the president. Mr. Deese\u2019s job as Mr. Obama\u2019s senior adviser in charge of climate policy is to push the president\u2019s ambitious environmental agenda to governors, industry executives and international negotiators \u2014 while under daily political attacks from Congress and the coal industry.\u201cIt\u2019s not the harrowing urgency of the economy falling off the cliff,\u201d Mr. Deese, 37, said of his new job during a recent interview in his West Wing office, just steps down the hall from Mr. Obama\u2019s. \u201cBut it\u2019s the urgency of, \u2018We have a limited amount of time left to change the trajectory on a really urgent crisis.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Deese, who has a stuffed snowy owl on a shelf in his office and a sparse beard that gives him the look of a Vermont hipster, is in some ways an unlikely person to lead the effort. He has never held a job in environmental policy, has never participated in an international negotiations and has nothing approaching the years of knowledge of John D. Podesta, who ran the president\u2019s climate change agenda until he stepped down in January as counselor to Mr. Obama.But Mr. Deese, who must now make sales pitches to governors and participate in global talks, has a reputation as a fast study.\u201cWith no business experience at all, he plunged into the auto thing with us and really figured it out,\u201d said Steven Rattner, the financial adviser who led Mr. Obama\u2019s auto bailout team. \u201cHe added an unbelievable amount of value with the way he thinks things through. I could totally trust his judgment.\u201dInstead of making the case for fighting global warming in the language of an environmental activist, Mr. Deese argues from the perspective of an economist, just as he did during the darkest days of the recession.He loves to cite his favorite new statistic: a recent report by the International Energy Agency that found that last year, global gross domestic product grew 3 percent, while carbon dioxide emissions flatlined. Historically, economic growth has paralleled the growth in fossil fuel emissions.\u201cThe data show it\u2019s possible to grow the economy without growing pollution,\u201d Mr. Deese said with visible excitement.Known for pacing while he talks on the telephone and sometimes going without shoes in the office, Mr. Deese appears at his most animated when plunging headlong into the wonkery of an issue.\u201cThis is somebody whose greatest joy is that swift arc up the learning curve,\u201d said Gene Sperling, the president\u2019s former national economics adviser. \u201cHe has both this amazing policy I.Q. that he can bring to any issue as well as the humility to reach out and find and listen to every expert on the planet on that issue.\u201dMr. Deese is now on a very steep learning curve. In January, he flew to New Delhi with the president and was in the room as Mr. Obama urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India to cut his nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.In March, Mr. Deese was in Kentucky, where anger against Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change plan runs deep. The plan requires states to cut carbon emissions, effectively forcing them to change their energy supply from fossil fuels to renewable sources \u2014 a tough sell in a coal-mining state like Kentucky. There Mr. Deese appeared with Governor Steven L. Beshear, a Democrat, at an event promoting a federal program to help coal communities and then spoke with him for an hour afterward about the climate change plan.Senior staff members in the offices of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said they have never heard from Mr. Deese.\u201cApparently, he\u2019s only talked to the press,\u201d Donald Stewart, Mr. McConnell\u2019s spokesman, said in an email.Raised in Belmont, Mass., a Boston suburb, Mr. Deese grew up hiking, sailing and fishing in a home where the environment was important. (His mother is an engineer who works in renewable energy, and his father is a political science professor at Boston College.) He graduated in 2000 from Middlebury College in Vermont, went to Washington to work in international aid and was soon hired as a policy analyst by Mr. Sperling, who was then at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization.Mr. Deese left Washington briefly to pursue his law degree but could not resist the lure of the 2008 presidential campaign, signing on as an economic policy adviser to Hillary Rodham Clinton and, after she conceded, switching over to Mr. Obama\u2019s staff, where he has remained ever since. He completed his law degree in 2009, by mail from Washington.Mr. Deese, who has a young daughter, arrives in the West Wing at 6:45 a.m. after a two-mile run to work, showers, then slings his yellow backpack on the hook on the back of his office door. He knows he does not have much time: The president and his allies fear that if the climate plan is not locked in place before Mr. Obama leaves office, a Republican president could undo it.\u201cYou have to work fast \u2014 each day matters,\u201d said Carol Browner, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s senior climate change adviser in his first term. \u201cYou have to ask, \u2018Have we lost a day? Have we lost a week?\u2019\u00a0\u201d As Mr. Deese put it, \u201cIt\u2019s a different kind of emergency.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andy Warhol\u2019s Guide to Public Policy", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI OFTEN ask people in my business \u2014 public policy \u2014 where they get their inspiration. Liberals often point to John F. Kennedy. Conservatives usually cite Ronald Reagan. Personally, I prefer the artist Andy Warhol, who famously declared, \u201cI like boring things.\u201d He was referring to art, of course. But the sentiment provides solid public policy guidance as well.Warhol\u2019s work exalted the everyday \u201cboring\u201d items that display the transcendental beauty of life itself. The canonical example is his famous paintings of Campbell Soup cans. Some people sneered, but those willing to look closely could see what he was doing. It is the same idea expressed in an old Zen saying, often attributed to the\u00a0eighth-century Chinese Buddhist philosopher Layman Pang: \u201cHow wondrously supernatural and miraculous! I draw water and I carry wood!\u201dWarhol\u2019s critical insight is usually lost on most of the world. This is not because people are stupid, but because our brains are wired to filter out the mundane and focus on the novel. This turns out to be an important survival adaptation. To discern a predator, you must filter out the constant rustling of leaves and notice the strange snap of a twig.Warhol believed that defeating this cognitive bias led to greater appreciation of beauty. It also leads to better public policy, especially in relieving poverty. For example, while our attention is naturally drawn to the latest fascinating and expensive innovations in tropical public health, many experts insist it is cheap, boring mosquito bed nets that best protect against malaria. Despite their lifesaving utility, these boring nets tend to be chronically underprovided.We can look closer to home, too. People love to find ways to get fancy technology into poor schoolchildren\u2019s hands, but arguably the best way to help children falling behind in school is simply to devise ways to get them to show up.But the very best example of the Warhol principle in policy is international trade. If it is progress against poverty that we\u2019re pursuing, trade beats the pants off every fancy development program ever devised. The simple mundane beauty of making things and exchanging them freely is the best anti-poverty achievement in history.\u00a0For more than two decades, the global poverty rate has been decreasing by roughly 1 percent a year. To put this in perspective, that comes to about 70 million people \u2014 equivalent to the whole population of Turkey or Thailand \u2014 climbing out of poverty annually. Add it up, and around a billion people have escaped destitution since 1990.Why? It isn\u2019t the United Nations or foreign aid. It is, in the words of the publication YaleGlobal Online, \u201cHigh growth spillovers originating from large open emerging economies that utilize cross-border supply chains.\u201d For readers who don\u2019t have tenure, that means free trade in poor countries.That mug in your hand that says \u201cMade in China\u201d is part of the reason that 680 million Chinese have been pulled out of absolute poverty since the 1980s. No giant collaboration among transnational technocrats or lending initiatives did that. It was because of economic reforms in China, of people making stuff, putting it on boats, and sending it to be sold in America \u2014 to you. Critics of free trade often argue that open economies lead to exploitation or environmental degradation. These are serious issues, but protectionism is never the answer. Curbing trade benefits entrenched domestic interests and works against the world\u2019s poor.\u00a0Trade doesn\u2019t solve every problem, of course. The world needs democracy, security and many other expressions of American values and leadership as well. But in a policy world crowded with outlandish, wasteful boondoggles, free trade is just the kind of beautifully boring Warholian strategy we need. Americans dedicated to helping others ought to support it without compromise or apology.A contributing opinion writer and the president of the American Enterprise Institute.

{"Headline": "Cheaper Robots, Fewer Workers", "Date": "2015-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobotica Episode 1This is the first episode in a Bits video series, called Robotica, examining how robots are poised to change the way we do business and conduct our daily lives. Waves of migrant workers from the countryside filled China\u2019s factories for the last three decades and helped make the nation the world\u2019s largest manufacturer. But many companies now find themselves struggling to hire enough workers. And for the scarce workers they do find, pay has more than quintupled in the last decade, to more than $500 a month in coastal provinces.Chinese businesses and the government are responding by designing and starting to install large numbers of robots, with the goal of keeping factories running and expanding without necessarily causing a drop in overall employment.Workers are scarce partly because of the government\u2019s \u201cone child\u201d policy and the rapid expansion of the university system.Government rules limiting most couples to just one child halved the birthrate in China from 1987 to 2003. The birthrate then leveled off at a lower level per 1,000 residents than in the United States. So China has lots of workers in their late 20s, but an ever-shrinking supply of workers now entering the work force each year.The main ages for factory labor in China and in other developing countries are 18 to 24. Compounding the labor shortage for China\u2019s manufacturing-intensive economy is that workers are staying in school longer \u2014 much longer. And following a Confucian tradition that the educated do not soil their hands with manual labor, graduates overwhelmingly refuse to accept factory work, except in supervisory, design or engineering positions.As recently as 1997, China had only 3.2 million undergraduate students. With the Asian financial crisis that year, China began expanding its universities quickly, in an attempt to offset job losses among young people.The expansion of universities has continued ever since, and 25.5 million undergraduates were enrolled by last December. Roughly a quarter of China\u2019s young people now attend at least some university, and the proportion is rising steadily.A few low-tech industries, like garment manufacturing, are moving from China to places that still have very low wages, like Bangladesh. But many industries, particularly electronics, are still moving factories to China. That is because so many of the parts suppliers are now in China that it is often more costly to do assembly elsewhere.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Balancing Costs and Competition", "Date": "2015-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRenewable energy was never a bargain compared with fossil fuels like natural gas and coal. Steep price declines in those commodities, especially lately, make it even tougher for alternatives like solar, wind and hydroelectric power to compete.Natural gas costs about $2.60 per thousand cubic feet, barely half as much as a year ago and over 80 percent less than its 2005 peak. Coal prices have fallen too, although less sharply. Even so, technological improvements and a persistent push from regulators for utilities to use cleaner fuel sources are keeping supply and demand for renewables high and reducing cost disadvantages over the long haul. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a secular increase in renewable capacity regardless of the current price of fossil fuels,\u201d said Francis O\u2019Sullivan, director of research and analysis at the M.I.T. Energy Initiative, a multidisciplinary group that studies energy issues.\u201cCapital costs, particularly for solar, have been falling quite dramatically over the last four or five years,\u201d he said. \u201cSimilar gains in competitiveness likely will not be achieved for conventional generation; that technology is much further along on the maturity curve.\u201dBut the price gap is still there, even if it\u2019s closing. That\u2019s slowing momentum toward renewables in the short run, said Deborah L. Byers, an expert on United States oil and gas at Ernst & Young. \u201cCosts have come down on wind farms built in the last few years, and they\u2019re making money, but we haven\u2019t seen installations of new wind farms, either,\u201d she said.M.I.T. estimates that a megawatt-hour of electricity, enough to power about 500 homes for an afternoon, will cost $65 to $70 this year if generated from water or land-based wind facilities; offshore wind and solar cost around twice as much. Natural gas is expected to beat them all easily: $40 for the same amount of electricity. The impact of plunging fossil fuel prices on renewables has not been greater in part because energy tends to be bought through long-term contracts. Southern California Edison, for instance, buys power in agreements lasting 10 to 30 years. Deals are signed continually \u2014 often on better terms for the utility \u2014 as old ones expire.\u201cThe newer the agreement, the lower the price\u201d for renewables, \u201cbecause the technology is improving and their prices are becoming more competitive,\u201d said Robert Laffoon-Villegas, a spokesman at Southern California Edison.Makers of solar panels can slice the silicon wafers from which they\u2019re made ever thinner, making each panel cheaper by using less material. Wind turbines are built larger, stronger and out of lighter-weight materials, increasing efficiency.Other breakthroughs, like new storage methods, are making renewable energy more user-friendly, said Dan Reicher, director of the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford University. \u201cIf you\u2019re running the grid, you\u2019re much more interested in a kilowatt-hour of intermittent solar or wind power if you know it can be managed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sun shines in the day but power is used at night; that\u2019s where storage comes in.\u201d New industrial-scale batteries facilitate storage, as do improved pumping techniques. Power generated during off-peak hours is used to push water uphill; when demand rises, the water is released, allowing gravity to supply the grid. Another method relies on compressed air.Renewables accounted for 13 percent of American electricity generation in 2013, according to the United States Energy Information Administration. It forecasts the proportion to rise to 18 percent in 2040.But renewables are still more expensive than gas. Utilities use them in part because they have to. Thirty states have mandates to increase the proportion of electricity generated from renewables, according to the E.I.A., including all Northeastern states except Vermont. Some organizations, such as the Institute for Energy Research, a Washington think tank, say mandates prop up electricity bills by raising demand for energy from more expensive sources. But certain renewables, like solar, wind and hydroelectric power, enjoy economies of scale that fossil fuels do not, others say, resulting in lower costs from the increased demand.\u201cRenewables have the advantage that their marginal cost is close to zero,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cWhen you develop a renewable facility and are able to get a connection to the grid, you\u2019ll always be the lowest-cost power source.\u201dBut you have to build the installation first. The investment and regulatory approvals needed to harness renewable energy are considerable. Economies of scale and competition among providers of renewable energy and between them and fossil fuel companies propel technological improvements that bring down the price of renewables and stimulate sales that finance the next round of innovation. Advances have been so swift and steady, especially in solar, that producers are inclined to bet on the future when they bid on contracts. \u201cThe numbers tend to be quite aggressive,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said, below what would be profitable today.Aggressive but perhaps not imprudent. M.I.T. projects the cost of electricity produced from onshore wind to drop about 10 percent by 2030, with declines of about 30 percent forecast for offshore wind and solar. Meanwhile, gas prices are forecast to rise about 25 percent. \u201cFurther declines in the cost of renewables are likely,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cThe slope of that decline is where the debate is; prices won\u2019t always march downward. But if renewables become a low-cost source, the grinding of teeth regarding fossil fuel usage will end.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The National Intelligence Service declined to confirm what the two lawmakers told reporters.Since eliminating his No. 2, Mr. Kim has frequently shifted jobs among his closest aides, and top generals have often been demoted and others promoted.South Korean officials said that when Mr. Kim ordered his country to close its borders to foreign tourists last October for fear of the Ebola virus, his instruction was so strictly followed that top government officials returning from overseas trips were required to go through a 21-day quarantine, and North Korean diplomats abroad were banned from home visits. North Korea lifted the Ebola ban in early March.Mr. Kim has spent his early years in power struggling to solidify his authority, as his country\u2019s economy has continued to flounder amid stricter international sanctions. He has made frequent visits to catfish farms, textile factories and military barracks to build his image as a caring leader and legitimate successor in his family\u2019s dynasty.His tactics of inspiring fear of purges and stoking competition for his favor, South Korean officials said, have fostered strong resentment among North Korea\u2019s elite.An earlier version of the capsule summary with this article misidentified the North Korean leader.

That was in line with the expectations, according to Reuters.Santander, one of Europe\u2019s largest banks, wrote down billions of euros in mortgages in 2013 amid a weak economy in Spain, its home market, but an improving economic outlook for the country has allowed the bank to decrease its provisions for bad loans in the past year.New loans to businesses in Spain increased 24 percent in the first quarter, while new loans to individuals in Spain rose 36 percent, Santander said. Over all, the bank\u2019s loan portfolio rose 14 percent to \u20ac813.3 billion. Santander does business in a variety of markets outside Spain, including Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United States.Provisions for delinquent and defaulted loans fell 4.9 percent to \u20ac2.56 billion, from \u20ac2.69 billion in the first quarter of 2014.The positive results at Santander come amid an accelerating economic recovery in Spain, which is expected to grow faster this year than a number of its European peers.On Monday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the country\u2019s economy is expected to grow 2.9 percent in 2014, up from an earlier forecast of 2.4 percent.The weakening of the euro against the United States dollar and the British pound also lifted Santander\u2019s results in the first quarter. Santander, which reports its results in euros, benefited from a weaker euro as its profit in countries outside of the eurozone was boosted by the exchange rate. Without the impact of the exchange rates, profits would have risen 22 percent, the bank said.Net interest income, or what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, rose 15 percent to \u20ac8.04 billion in the first quarter, compared with \u20ac6.9 billion in the same period a year earlier.Santander\u2019s nonperforming loan rate, which measures loans in default, was 4.85 percent, about 0.34 of a percentage point lower than in the fourth quarter.Operating expenses rose 10.9 percent to \u20ac5.38 billion, from \u20ac4.85 billion in the first quarter of 2014.Santander\u2019s earnings in Spain jumped 42.1 percent to \u20ac357 million in the first quarter, from \u20ac251 million in the same period a year earlier.In Britain, the bank\u2019s profit rose 27 percent to \u20ac477 million in the first quarter, from \u20ac376 million in the first quarter of 2014.In Santander\u2019s operations in Latin America, profit increased 28.5 percent to \u20ac914 million in the first quarter, from \u20ac712 million in the prior-year period.Advertisement"}

And why bother with the online shopping sector at all, they asked, when Google was competing with the likes of Amazon?Ms. Vestager delivered her standard, steely, it\u2019s-not-personal rebuttals.When asked about her reputation for toughness in a phone interview last week, Ms. Vestager acted taken aback.\u201cI don\u2019t think of it as toughness,\u201d Ms. Vestager said. Of her approach to her new job, she added: \u201cConsumers depend on us to make sure that competition is fair and open, and it\u2019s my responsibility to make that happen.\u201dShe has taken a narrower and more assertive approach.\u201cIt was obvious that a negotiated solution was not a possibility,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in the phone interview. \u201cSo I felt we should go in another direction.\u201dGoogle has 10 weeks to respond, she said, and has the right to call a hearing to present the company\u2019s views.Ms. Vestager may have a wider agenda. In addition to the formal complaint related to Google Shopping, Ms. Vestager said her office was still looking into accusations that Google had restricted its advertising partners from using rival platforms and that it scraped online content from competitors. She also announced a separate \u201cin-depth investigation\u201d into accusations of anticompetitive company practices regarding Google\u2019s relationships with device manufacturers that rely on its Android operating system.Longtime observers of Ms. Vestager theorized that she had chosen to initially pursue a narrow case in which she had the most confidence, while keeping pressure on her adversary to settle by opening parallel lines of inquiry.Ms. Vestager came to Washington last week ostensibly to participate in antitrust meetings of the American Bar Association. But arriving the day after announcing the charges against Google, she was bound to attract attention. Despite the ruckus, she stuck to her routines.On her first morning in the capital, she rose early and went for a jog. She came up with a regular route on earlier trips to attend meetings of the International Monetary Fund.\u201cI run past the White House, down the Mall and out 21st Street,\u201d she said.Ms. Vestager had a marathon official schedule in Washington on Thursday that started at 8 a.m. and ended more than 12 hours later. After lunch with a high-ranking State Department official, she and three aides headed to an interview at Fox Business.\u201cOnce in a while, you can bring people backstage to see what is going on there,\u201d she said.\u201cThat was very amusing,\u201d Mr. Krasnik said. \u201cIt also puts a human face on her, which might be seen as a necessity, because she is seen as a very tough, coldhearted politician.\u201dMs. Vestager grew up as the daughter of two ministers of the Church of Denmark. Her parents made themselves available to comfort the afflicted at all hours.\u201cYou could always come over in the middle of the night or in the early morning; it was open to anyone from the most self-important people to the most vulnerable citizens,\u201d she said. \u201cI think this very open way of doing their job informed my view of what a society should be like.\u201dShe learned how to knit from her grandmother, and one of her elephants is being auctioned this weekend in Brooklyn to benefit the Danish Seamen\u2019s Church there.

After she arrived in Brussels, she says, she simply asked the commission\u2019s staff to update the files on the Google case and then she met executives at companies who had accused Google of anticompetitive practices, as well as with Google executives.

If Ms. Vestager prevails against Google, some antitrust experts say, it could make it easier for her to bring a case against Gazprom, the Russian national gas behemoth, a company whose market power her office is also investigating.Among antitrust regulators, Ms. Vestager may be the only marshal self-assured enough to carry around half-knitted elephants in her purse.Aaron Kessler and Danny Hakim contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Arkansas Governor Asks Lawmakers to Recall Religious Exception Bill", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLITTLE ROCK, Ark. \u2014 Facing a backlash from businesses and gay rights advocates, Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas on Wednesday called on state lawmakers to either recall or amend legislation billed as a religious freedom measure so that it mirrored a federal law approved in 1993.Mr. Hutchinson, a Republican, said he understood the divide in Arkansas and across the nation over the question of same-sex marriage and its impact on people\u2019s religious beliefs. His own son, Seth, he said, had asked him to veto the bill, which critics say could allow individuals and businesses to discriminate against gay men and lesbians.To ensure that the state is \u201ca place of tolerance,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said, he was considering using an executive order that would seek to balance the \u201ccompeting constitutional obligations\u201d if the legislature declined to make changes to the bill.\u201cWhat is important from an Arkansas standpoint is one, we get the right balance,\u201d he said, \u201cand secondly, we make sure that we communicate we\u2019re not going to be a state that fails to recognize the diversity of our workplace, our economy and our future.\u201d\u201cThis is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said. \u201cBut these are not ordinary times.\u201dTwo state legislative leaders \u2014 Senator Jonathan Dismang, president pro tem of the Senate, and Jeremy Gillam, speaker of the House \u2014 who appeared with Mr. Hutchinson at a news conference Wednesday, said they agreed that the bill should be changed, but that they could not guarantee that outcome.The legislation, which easily cleared the state House by lopsided margins, has created a political rift in the state, with Mark Stodola, the mayor of Little Rock, sending a letter to Mr. Hutchinson this week urging him to veto the bill, saying it would have \u201ca negative impact on our state\u2019s image.\u201dSeveral businesses and tech companies, including the state\u2019s largest private employer, Walmart, as well as the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce, the Arkansas Municipal League and other civic groups have spoken out against the legislation.The Indiana law has touched off a storm of protests from businesses, local governments and college athletics.In Indianapolis on Wednesday, lawmakers were weighing language they intend to add to the state\u2019s law as part of what Mr. Pence has described as \u201ca clarification\u201d and also \u201ca fix.\u201d Precise wording was still being hashed out, officials said, but Mr. Pence has said that the intent will be to clarify that the state\u2019s law does not give businesses the right to deny services to anyone, including gay men and lesbiansWith the N.C.A.A. Final Four tournament in Indianapolis this weekend and mounting pressure from business leaders, Indiana lawmakers were racing to draft new language, then hurry the revised measure through both chambers of the state legislature for Mr. Pence\u2019s signature before week\u2019s end.To expedite the process, aides said legislators were expected to use an unrelated, but almost-approved Senate bill as a vehicle for the new language. That would allow them to reach agreement on language during a committee meeting of selected lawmakers, then move the measure through both chambers immediately.Still, Democrats, who hold the minority, have said they intend to push for a repeal, and it remained uncertain whether all Republicans would l support what some conservatives in the state view as a watered-down measure.The bill in Arkansas is similar to the Indiana law, but both diverge in certain respects from the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. That act was passed in 1993 and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, Arkansas\u2019s most famous political son.Both states\u2019 laws allow for larger corporations, if they are substantially owned by members with strong religious convictions, to claim that a ruling or mandate violates their religious faith, something reserved for individuals or family businesses in other versions of the law. Both allow religious parties to go to court to head off a \u201clikely\u201d state action that they fear will impinge on their beliefs, even if it has not yet happened.The Arkansas act contains another difference in wording, several legal experts said, that could make it harder for the government to override a claim of religious exemption. The state, according to the Arkansas bill, must show that a law or requirement that someone is challenging is \u201cessential\u201d to the furtherance of a compelling governmental interest, a word that is absent from the federal law and those in other states, including Indiana.\u201cIt has way too broad an application,\u201d said John DiPippa, a law professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, who had spoken before the legislature in 2011 on behalf of a narrower and ultimately unsuccessful version of the bill. \u201cI never anticipated or supported applying it to for-profit companies and certainly never anticipated it applying to actions outside of government.\u201dThe future of similar measures elsewhere remained unclear. In Georgia, where the legislature will adjourn for the year on Thursday, opponents of a pending proposal rallied Tuesday outside the State Capitol. Although the bill\u2019s path has been turbulent \u2014 a Monday committee hearing about the measure was canceled \u2014 supporters and critics alike said it could be approved in the session\u2019s final hours. North Carolina is far earlier in its debate. Religious freedom proposals surfaced last week in both the House and the Senate, and neither has faced a vote at even the committee level.Campbell Robertson reported from Little Rock, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York.

{"Headline": "BlackRock\u2019s Chief, Laurence Fink, Urges Other C.E.O.s to Stop Being So Nice to Investors", "Date": "2015-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookOn Tuesday morning, the chief executives of 500 of the nation\u2019s largest companies will receive a letter in the mail that will most likely surprise them.The sender of the letter is Laurence D. Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world. Mr. Fink oversees more than $4 trillion \u2014 that\u2019s trillion with a \u201ct\u201d \u2014 of investments, making him perhaps the world\u2019s most important shareholder.He is planning to tell the leaders that too many of them have been trying to return money to investors through so-called shareholder-friendly steps like paying dividends and buying back stock.To Mr. Fink, these maneuvers, often done under pressure from activist investors, are harming the long-term creation of value and may be doing companies and their investors a disservice, despite the increases in stock prices that have often been the result.\u201cThe effects of the short-termist phenomenon are troubling both to those seeking to save for long-term goals such as retirement and for our broader economy,\u201d Mr. Fink writes in the letter. He says that such moves were being done at the expense of investing in \u201cinnovation, skilled work forces or essential capital expenditures necessary to sustain long-term growth.\u201d At a time when most investors are clamoring \u2014 and applauding \u2014 high dividends and bigger buybacks, Mr. Fink is bucking the trend.Rather than consider the return of all this money to shareholders positively, Mr. Fink says the move \u201csends a discouraging message about a company\u2019s ability to use its resources wisely and develop a coherent plan to create value over the long term.\u201d Moreover, he argues that \u201cwith interest rates approaching zero, returning excessive amounts of capital to investors\u201d isn\u2019t helpful because they \u201cwill enjoy comparatively meager benefits from it in this environment.\u201dMr. Fink and I have been discussing \u2014 and debating \u2014 this topic for more than a year. Last week, before mailing his letter, which he writes annually, he shared it with me.\u201cI feel the same pressures as other C.E.O.s,\u201d he told me. But he suggested that it\u2019s not just the fault of managements for being so shortsighted \u2014 the investors themselves may be the problem. \u201cInvestors need to focus on long-term strategies and long-term outcomes,\u201d Mr. Fink said, suggesting we\u2019re currently living in a \u201cgambling society.\u201dMr. Fink has a novel suggestion for encouraging shareholders to take a broader perspective, but it may very well upset his peers on Wall Street. He recommends that gains on investments held for less than three years be taxed as ordinary income, not at the usually lower long-term capital gains rate, which now applies after one year. \u201cWe believe that U.S. tax policy, as it stands, incentivizes short-term behavior,\u201d he writes in his letter. \u201cSince when was one year considered a long-term investment? A more effective structure would be to grant long-term treatment only after three years, and then to decrease the tax rate for each year of ownership beyond that, potentially dropping to zero after 10 years.\u201dMr. Fink contends that such a shift in tax policy \u201cwould create a profound incentive for more long-term holdings and could be designed to be revenue neutral. In short, tax reform that promotes long-term investment will benefit both the companies who rely on capital markets and the hundreds of millions of people saving for retirement.\u201dAsked whether such a change in tax policy would reduce liquidity in the market, Mr. Fink scoffed: \u201cI don\u2019t think Warren Buffett cares about liquidity that much.\u201dIt is refreshing to see a finance executive talk some sense on these issues.However, Mr. Fink is not simply being altruistic. To some degree, he is talking his own book: BlackRock\u2019s business model, unlike those of so many finance companies that rely on trading fees, does not require it to turn over its portfolio. Given its size and scale, BlackRock often holds its investments for decades. So from a financial perspective, Mr. Fink has little to lose. In fact, the firm may have much to gain if tax rules were adjusted to be more favorable to the way Mr. Fink invests. (And what\u2019s the harm in suggesting tax policy change, as smart as it may be, that has a low probability of ever happening?)That\u2019s not to suggest Mr. Fink doesn\u2019t believe what he\u2019s saying; he does. He is a relatively progressive finance executive who has been a longtime Democrat and has taken positions that many of his peers in finance abhor.To Mr. Fink, the shortsightedness that pervades corporate America is just a symptom of a larger issue. \u201cThis is not just a corporate problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a societal problem, whether it\u2019s health care or politics or business.\u201dHe also said he recognized that his letter might not be popular in certain quarters but he qualified his approach by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make friends or enemies.\u201dDespite his protestations, Mr. Fink said, \u201cThere is nothing inherently wrong with returning capital to shareholders in a measured fashion.\u201d He added, \u201cNor are the demands of activists necessarily at odds with the interests of other shareholders.\u201d But it\u2019s when it is taken to extremes \u2014 such as it seems to be in the current marketplace \u2014 that has Mr. Fink concerned.Still, Mr. Fink is taking a direct shot at the rise of activist investors, like Carl C. Icahn, who have made careers out of pressing companies to return cash to shareholders.Mr. Fink said he met with two activists last week. One of them, he said, told him, \u201cYou hate me, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t hate you,\u201d Mr. Fink said he replied. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get some balance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Old Haunt of U.S. Spies Becomes a Playground for Istanbul\u2019s Elite", "Date": "2015-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIstanbul JournalISTANBUL \u2014 For more than a century, the grand Italianate mansion that serves as an anchor of this city\u2019s European quarter was a beehive of American diplomacy and espionage. Spies toiled within and met their agents at the bar across the street, reporters dropped by for after-work drinks, and any Turk could walk in off the street to see the latest art exhibition or browse the library. There seemed to be a celebration every night.\u201cWe were partying all the time,\u201d said Ayse Ozakinci, who was a librarian for four decades in the imposing structure, the American Consulate in Istanbul. \u201cThere was a festive mood for everyone.\u201dAnd then, a dozen years ago, the party stopped and security walls enclosed the mansion, as the threat of terrorism sent American diplomats to a fortified hillside compound on the city\u2019s outskirts, overlooking the Bosporus.That put the American government in the real estate business, thanks to a law that required the State Department to keep ownership of the historic building as a space to foster relations between the United States and the Middle East.Now the party is back on, but not exactly in the way lawmakers had intended.The walls came down recently, offering breathing room to a crammed neighborhood and unveiling the building\u2019s rebirth as an opulent clubhouse for Istanbul\u2019s social elite. With a new luxury hotel beside it, the mansion, under a 51-year, roughly $25 million lease with the United States government, is the latest outpost of the private club empire Soho House.But the cost of renovations and upkeep eventually made it necessary to find a commercial use for the structure, known as the Palazzo Corpi for the rich shipbuilder who had it constructed in the 19th century as his home. Soho House, with its Turkish partner Bilgili Holding, has invested nearly $110 million in the project and is now the primary tenant, while the Hollings Center will have an office in the building and run its programs and workshops from there.Walking through the building recently for the first time in years, Ms. Ozakinci, who is not a member of the new club, marveled at the renovations, saying they had restored much of the original grandeur, even as she lamented that the mansion was not open to the public.She described how the modest wife of one former ambassador had ordered that ceiling murals depicting nude goddesses be painted over. The murals have now been rescued from layers of oil and paint.She said there had been a \u201csecret floor\u201d up top for the Central Intelligence Agency.\u201cWe pretended not to know about that,\u201d she said.A rooftop pool, flanked by yellow-and-white striped beds and with a sweeping view of the Golden Horn waterway and the minarets of the old city, is a fresh touch. Inside, a layered approach to interior design creates a \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d-meets-\u201cMad Men\u201d effect, mixing late 19th-century with midcentury modern furniture. There are vintage club chairs and old chesterfield sofas, and many new pieces manufactured in Turkey and made to look antique by workers banging away with hammers and chains.Nick Jones, the founder and chief executive of Soho House, a growing network of private clubs across Europe and North America, decided on an Istanbul location after visiting the city several years ago. \u201cI just fell in love with it,\u201d he said. \u201cWow. I was taken with the place. It sort of reminded me of New York energy.\u201dMr. Jones committed to Istanbul before violent antigovernment protests swept Turkey in 2013, and before the economy slowed, diminishing an image of the country as a rising global power that took hold in the earlier years of the Islamist government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was prime minister for more than a decade and is now president.Mr. Jones said he watched the unfolding political turmoil closely but was not scared away. \u201cIn my experience, 20 to 25 years now, whatever happens, people still want to eat and drink and have a bit of fun,\u201d he said.A committee decides whom to admit and whom to reject, and careful attention is paid to artists, writers and filmmakers, or as Mr. Jones put it, the \u201ccreative soul\u201d of Istanbul. \u201cThe struggling scriptwriter is still one of our favorite members,\u201d he said.But having money is important, too, and plenty of bankers and lawyers make their way through the door.Amid the opulence, the drinking and the networking among the elite, there is also an inescapable sense of separateness: Those who gather here, despite their pretensions, represent a stratum of society far from the center of things in Turkey these days. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government has pushed for more religion in public life, cracked down on alcohol and made Islamic schooling more widely available.The mansion sits as a testament to a bygone \u2014 some would say more innocent \u2014 era of American diplomacy, when Foreign Service officers and spies, in Istanbul but also around the world, could interact freely and casually with locals, without the barriers of high walls and intricate security procedures.\u201cHere in the middle of the city, everyone came in,\u201d said Ms. Ozakinci, who added that \u201crelations flourished\u201d between Americans and Turks. When the consulate moved to the fortified compound in 2003, she said, \u201csuddenly we were far from everything and no one wanted to come.\u201dGraham Fuller, who as a young C.I.A. officer was stationed in Istanbul in the 1960s, recalled the time in an email as \u201ctruly a bygone era when American diplomats were still welcomed and part of the inner city life with only a lazy guard or two keeping watch over the consulate. The magic of the neighborhood still lingers in those back streets, but the American presence no longer does.\u201dThings began to change after the Persian Gulf war, Ms. Ozakinci said. Sandbags were piled near the windows, and eventually the street in front was closed to traffic and visitors had to be cleared days in advance.The building was bought by the United States in 1907 \u2014 the first real estate it owned in Europe and the second worldwide, after a facility in Tangier, Morocco, a gift from the ruler of the country. The mansion was the American Embassy in the late years of the Ottoman Empire and became the consulate after Ankara was named the capital of the Turkish republic.If the walls could speak, they might tell of the ghost of a Genoese shipping magnate\u2019s mistress, once said to haunt the halls and ornate rooms, or of the time the building changed hands in a poker game.The latter tale goes like this: The rich American ambassador posted in the early 1900s to what was then called Constantinople bought the building with money out of his own pocket, for 28,000 Ottoman liras, or the equivalent of $123,200 at the time, on the assumption that he would be reimbursed by Congress. Washington lawmakers refused. Then, as recounted in a memoir by an American teacher who lived here then and as passed down through generations of diplomats, the ambassador organized a party for senators and congressmen.\u201cThere were rich meats, there were unlimited quantities of first class drinks, and finally there was poker which lasted deep in to the night,\u201d the teacher wrote.At some point, having lost \u201cconspicuous sums,\u201d the ambassador proposed the embassy as a bet. If he lost, he would pay for it. But he won, and Congress, it is said, appropriated the funds and acquired the mansion.The story may be apocryphal, but it has persisted, lending the mansion\u2019s majestic history an extra glint of intrigue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Weighs How to Recast Ties to Obama", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe defeated her in a grueling Democratic nomination battle. Then she pursued his agenda across the world as secretary of state. Now, the delicate relationship between Hillary Rodham Clinton and President Obama is about to get even more complicated.For months, Mrs. Clinton and her team have pored over Mr. Obama\u2019s poll ratings, policies and constituencies, seeking to solve a central riddle for the campaign she is about to begin: How can she run for president as her own person, without criticizing the sitting president she served \u2014 while her Republican opponents will be working to demonize them both?\u201cThat\u2019s the anchor she\u2019ll be dragging for the next couple of years,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, who was a top strategist for Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee.Mrs. Clinton will also be trying to defy political history: Only once since the establishment of the two-term limit in 1951 has a candidate won an election to succeed a president from the same party \u2014 and it was the first President George Bush, whose predecessor, Ronald Reagan, remained popular at the time and was beloved by Republicans.Yet Mrs. Clinton and her team have decided that, on balance, the risk of lining up near Mr. Obama\u2019s record is worth taking.Rather than run from Mr. Obama, she intends to turn to him as one of her campaign\u2019s most important allies and advocates \u2014 second only, perhaps, to her husband, the other president whose record will hover over her bid.Mrs. Clinton can expect little if any opposition in the Democratic primaries. But she was similarly well positioned when she declared her candidacy in 2007.In a general election, Mr. Obama is expected to help Mrs. Clinton raise money, and he would be asked to campaign for her in, among other places, the most heavily African-American counties of the swing states that he won in 2008 and 2012, according to numerous people briefed on the plans, who discussed them on the condition of anonymity.Mr. Obama would most likely be scarce on the stump in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania, where Mrs. Clinton defeated him in the 2008 primaries by appealing to women and white working-class voters.Advisers say Mrs. Clinton will promise a \u201cnew chapter\u201d that would expand upon Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to address persistently stagnant wages and rising inequality.\u201cI think that\u2019s what the campaign is about: How do we, with all the improvement of the economy, assure there are stronger paychecks for all Americans?\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader.On the eve of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s announcement, the president praised her Saturday in a televised news conference as someone who would make an \u201cexcellent president.\u201dNick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said that she \u201cis proud of what was accomplished, both as President Obama\u2019s partner on critical issues of national security, and on the progress made on the domestic front\u201d and that \u201ca campaign would be about laying out her own vision for tackling our toughest challenges.\u201dBut seeking a \u201cthird Obama term,\u201d as some put it in the shorthand of political operatives, is not a simple matter for Mrs. Clinton. She can take little credit for the administration\u2019s signature domestic accomplishments, like the Affordable Care Act, and she has scant leeway to disavow what Republicans portray as Mr. Obama\u2019s misguided foreign-policy moves in places like Iran, Israel and Russia.Donald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention.The approach is laden with uncertainty: While few Democrats expect Mr. Obama to be as unpopular as Mr. Bush in 2008, some worry that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s endorsement of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies, whether tacit or explicit, would presume continuing economic tailwinds and the absence of crises that could damage the president\u2019s standing. Moreover, by praising Mr. Obama\u2019s accomplishments, along with those of her husband\u2019s presidency, Mrs. Clinton, 67, could seem too focused on the past.\u201cHow do you leverage the benefits and accomplishments of the last four years but make clear this is an election about the future?\u201d said Chris Lehane, a strategist who worked for Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Strategic ShiftMrs. Clinton\u2019s strategic calculation is a sharp change in perspective from late last year, after Republicans gained a majority in the Senate and retained control of the House in the midterm elections, when a record 55 percent of Americans said they disapproved of the president.But recent internal polling led by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief strategist, Joel Benenson, showed that independent voters, in particular, were frustrated with Washington\u2019s \u201cinability to get things done,\u201d yet are not looking for wholesale changes to the Obama administration\u2019s policies.\u201cEven people who are ambivalent about President Obama\u2019s record want to elect a president who will do things, rather than a president who will undo things,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a pollster who was a chief strategist on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign.Walking a fine line, Mrs. Clinton will try to present herself as more capable of working across the aisle than the current administration, without directly criticizing Mr. Obama.The comments were notably evocative of Mr. Obama\u2019s rhetoric in the 2008 campaign \u2014 which Mrs. Clinton mocked as evidence of his na\u00efvet\u00e9 and inexperience. \u201cNow, I could stand up here and say: \u2018Let\u2019s just get everybody together. Let\u2019s get unified,\u2019 \u201d she said to a roar of laughter at a Rhode Island rally that year. \u201cThe skies will open, the light will come down, celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect.\u201dBut Mrs. Clinton\u2019s gentle reproach about partisanship of late is meant to reassure independent voters that she would be a consensus builder as president.For Mr. Obama\u2019s loyalists, however \u2014 particularly black voters, who turned out for him in record numbers \u2014 such talk represents an implicit criticism of the president \u2014 that he failed to meet his promise to bridge, if not end, the partisan divide.\u201cThat\u2019s the gantlet that is really tough,\u201d said Robert Gibbs, Mr. Obama\u2019s former press secretary. \u201cThe question is what percentage of the electorate in very important states is going to be African-American, without an African-American on the ballot.\u201dAt least, Mrs. Clinton will not have to contend with the quagmire that Vice President Gore faced in 2000, when he tried to embrace President Clinton\u2019s popular policies while distancing himself from the scandals that had engulfed the administration and largely benching Mr. Clinton from the campaign trail. Mr. Gore\u2019s laborious efforts, which were heavily second-guessed after his defeat, included testing subtle word changes to help distinguish himself from Mr. Clinton while still taking credit for the era\u2019s prosperity.Setting Herself ApartIn one way, Mrs. Clinton has plenty of maneuvering room to set herself apart from Mr. Obama: by appealing to voters as a mother and grandmother, and highlighting issues like equal pay and paid family leave that disproportionately affect women. And she intends to address stagnant wages and income inequality in new ways; one potential proposal would offer incentives to corporations that allow employees to share in profits.Perhaps the stickiest area for Mrs. Clinton in putting daylight between her and Mr. Obama will be foreign policy \u2014 her portfolio as his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.But Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers say any tensions with the White House would quickly be magnified, as happened during Mr. Gore\u2019s campaign, and distract voters from her message. \u201cThere will be a huge examination of where there is friction,\u201d said Michael Feldman, a former aide to Mr. Gore.For Mr. Obama, there is good reason to tolerate any gibes from Mrs. Clinton, real or perceived.With Republicans in control of Congress, Mr. Gibbs said, \u201che needs her to win this election so that the things he wants history to remember as his most consequential accomplishments aren\u2019t undone in the first 100 days of a Republican administration.\u201dMr. Obama, who is loath to drift into lame-duck status too soon, has been guarded in his comments about the 2016 race, partly, aides say, out of respect for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has not ruled out a presidential campaign.But asked on Saturday whether he hoped Mrs. Clinton would run on his record, Mr. Obama said, \u201cI\u2019m not on the ballot.\u201dHe said she would have her own record and message to run on. \u201cI think she would be an excellent president,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the risk Hillary Rodham Clinton would be taking if she aligns her campaign for president too closely with President Obama\u2019s policies misstated the number of years she was in the Senate. It was eight, not six.videoAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s as if I were entering a war zone.In fairness, those 14 months have seen a string of calamitous events that have left much of Russia transformed: the annexation of Crimea; war in eastern Ukraine; the deterioration of relations with the West; sanctions; President Vladimir V.

Tourism from the West has been cut in half.Yet for visitors, life generally goes on as usual in the affluent, cosmopolitan centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg where the vast majority of foreign tourists spend most or all of their time.

The State Department is the most cautious, warning Americans against attending demonstrations and urging \u201cgood security practices\u201d in public places.Still, contrary to the images often evoked by the news media, there\u2019s little evidence to suggest that Russia\u2019s top destinations are any less safe now for visitors than they were a few years ago.That\u2019s not to say there has not been a change in mood. As a Western tourist anywhere, it\u2019s often a good idea to avoid political discussions in places with very drunk people, but even more so in Russia. Helped along by television propaganda, many people in Russia blame the West for their current economic problems and the war in Ukraine. The proportion of Russians who say they have a negative view of the United States has more than doubled over the past year, according to a recent poll by the independent Levada-Center. Yet there\u2019s a sizable gap between what is said in opinion polls, and what\u2019s represented in everyday interactions.Or as my friend Maria Baronova, a prominent opposition activist, once put it: \u201cWe hate you Americans so much that we treat you like V.I.P.s.\u201dLong gone may be the days when speaking loudly in American English was the best way to make it past \u201cface control\u201d at the entrances of Moscow\u2019s exclusive nightclubs, but after nearly a year here, I have yet to see or hear of Western tourists being harassed because of their nationality. I\u2019ve witnessed more anti-American sentiment in Berlin, albeit of the smug European leftist variety, than I have in Moscow.\u201cI was expecting way more of a difference,\u201d said Kate Wood, a 16-year-old from Chapel Hill, N.C., who was visiting Moscow for the second time as part of an annual church trip to volunteer at an orphanage in the Kirov region. I came upon her and several of her fellow congregants eating ice cream and speaking loudly in English at a cafe on the ground floor of GUM department store on Red Square.\u201cI guess I was thinking that we would need to keep a lower profile,\u201d added Ms. Wood, who was last in Moscow before Western sanctions or the war in eastern Ukraine, \u201cbut no one\u2019s reacted badly to us at all, and we\u2019re even kind of loud.\u201dProbably the biggest selling point for visiting Russia now, though, is the drastic devaluation of the ruble, which lost more than half its worth at the end of last year. Even taking into account inflation (recorded at 16.7 percent in February) and the ruble\u2019s considerable rebound over the past few months, the country is more affordable than at any time in recent memory. At the beginning of 2014, a dollar bought 32.86 rubles. In mid-April this year, it bought 49.80.For tourists, this means paying 15 to 50 percent less for just about everything. A year ago, a cappuccino in Moscow cost the equivalent of $8 or $9. Now it\u2019s rarely more than $5. Though airlines, even Russia\u2019s Aeroflot, keep their tickets indexed at dollar rates, most hotels have not substantially raised their ruble prices.\u201cThis is a very good moment to try to change the image of Russia and to attract tourists from different countries, because the ruble is so cheap,\u201d said Maya Lomidze, the executive director of the Association of Tour Operators of Russia. Indeed, some companies have managed to offset losses by using the ruble crash as a marketing angle.\u201cWe make connections on the exchange rate to attract tourists and agents from different countries, and I think it works quite well,\u201d said Olya Skoveleva, a travel manager at Visit Russia, a private tour company that actually reports a 15 percent increase in Western tourists in the past year. The Westerners\u2019 most popular destinations by far are Moscow and St. Petersburg, but the company also sends them to Sochi and the Black Sea or to smaller towns along the so-called Golden Ring of small cities northeast of Moscow, albeit in the company of an official guide.Ms. Skoveleva said that many visitors are initially quite concerned for their safety but are ultimately reassured.\u201cWe explain to them that nothing will disturb them regarding the political issues,\u201d she said. \u201cConsidering the international situation and how it appears in the media, it is even sometimes surprising to me, but it\u2019s the reality.\u201d\u201cPutin,\u201d she added, \u201cis not the whole country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Job Numbers Show Just How Muddy the Economic Outlook Is", "Date": "2015-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Jobs ReportFor the last few months, there has been a bit of a mystery in the economic data. The American job market seemed to be roaring, with the nation adding around 300,000 jobs a month. But most every other measure of the economy was softer, suggesting more of the slow growth that has been all too typical the last several years.Eventually, something was going to have to change. Either job growth would need to slow down to match the economy, or economic growth would need to speed up to keep pace with the terrific jobs numbers.That adjustment happened in March, according to jobs numbers released Friday. It adjusted, though, not in the direction that Americans hoping for a stronger economy would prefer.It now appears that soft numbers so far in 2015 on consumer spending, durable goods orders and industrial activity were telling us something meaningful, and while the job market still looks quite solid over all, it probably isn\u2019t going quite as gangbusters as it had seemed.Some of the weakness is surely due to a brutal winter in much of the country, which should lead to a bounce-back with the spring thaw. But it will take time to see how much of the softness is temporary and how much is reflective of the true, underlying path of the economy.The truth is, a quarter of the way through 2015, we still don\u2019t have a particularly good handle on whether this is shaping up to be a great year for the economy, on par with the late 1990s, or one of sluggish muddling-through typical of the last five years.In theory, the benefit to consumers of lower fuel prices should be more than enough to overcome the slowdown in oil exploration resulting from cheaper oil. But the lift you would expect to see in spending hasn\u2019t really arrived. Retail sales fell in both January and February.The lower unemployment rate should mean that employers looking to add workers must get in bidding wars, driving up wages and creating a virtuous circle of higher worker pay, higher consumer spending and stronger growth. There is plenty off anecdotal evidence that employers are raising pay, including a decision this week by McDonald\u2019s to increase its minimum hourly wage for company-owned restaurants.And a stronger dollar versus other global currencies is resulting from optimism about American economic growth and expectations the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates. But there are feedback loops in which the strong dollar may be putting American exporters in a weaker competitive position, which is undermining the optimism that led markets to bid up the dollar to begin with. Unsurprisingly, the euro soared versus the dollar on news of the weak payroll numbers.Where it all settles is still unclear. The good news is that if you look at the longer time horizon, the job market still looks quite strong. Job gains have averaged 261,000 a month over the last six months.But whether 2015 will turn out to be a blockbuster year for the economy is more of an open question than it had seemed at 8:29 a.m. Friday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Vietnam Must Now Do", "Date": "2015-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHO CHI MINH CITY \u2014 Vietnam must sign on to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the United States-backed comprehensive trade plan. The agreement would allow Vietnam\u2019s economy to become fully integrated with the rest of the industrialized world, and with that would come the prospect of further democratization at home. Equally important, the T.P.P., which involves 12 Pacific countries but not China, would realign geopolitical relations in the region and help stave off China\u2019s expansionism in the South China Sea \u2014 an important contribution to the United States\u2019s strategic rebalancing toward Asia. Vietnam has nearly 3,500 kilometers of coastline fronting the South China Sea, a body of water vital to international trade. Almost one-third of the world\u2019s crude oil and over half of its liquefied natural gas passed through here in 2013. This route is also the shortest way from the western Pacific to the Indian Ocean, and a favored passage for many navies, including that of the United States.But Vietnam cannot play its significant geopolitical role until it fully develops economically and further liberalizes politically. And adopting the T.P.P.\u2019s requirements \u2014 free trade unions, reduced state participation in the economy, greater transparency \u2014 will help Vietnam along that route. Following many years of economic isolationism, Vietnam made impressive progress after 1986, when it began to open up to the outside world. It recorded one of the world\u2019s highest G.D.P. growth rates during 1990-2010. It joined the World Trade Organization in 2007, and has since signed many important trade agreements. It was the world\u2019s second-largest exporter of rice and coffee in 2013. Last year, Vietnam was Asean\u2019s top exporter to the United States in dollar terms, ahead of Malaysia and Thailand. But this was just a first phase of development, and it relied heavily on primary exports and labor-intensive and low-value-added industries. Vietnam now risks being stuck at the middle-income level. G.D.P. growth rates have slowed down significantly in recent years. Vietnam now ranks last among T.P.P. candidates in terms of economic development, with a G.D.P. per capita of about $1,910, compared with about $6,660 for Peru, the next lowest. The T.P.P. provides a road map for the second phase of Vietnam\u2019s economic and social development. As Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said in February, citing this and other trade deals: \u201cThese agreements require us to be more open. So our market must become more dynamic and efficient.\u201d The T.P.P. would mean, for example, a substantial reduction in import tariffs that apply to Vietnamese apparel entering other T.P.P. countries, which will increase the competitiveness of those products against similar goods from China, India, Indonesia and Thailand. But the T.P.P.\u2019s Rules of Origin also require that the materials used in the finished exports be produced locally. This will force Vietnam to develop supporting industries and expand its manufacturing base \u2014 as well as help it become less dependent on China, which currently supplies much of the materials used in Vietnam\u2019s textile and apparel industry. The T.P.P. also demands that its members embrace free labor unions, intellectual property rights and transparency in rules, regulations and practices. Perhaps most significant for Vietnam is the expectation that the governments of T.P.P. countries will not grant preferential treatment to state-owned enterprises or otherwise allow them to cause trade distortions. This will mean substantially reducing the role of such companies in Vietnam. State-owned enterprises dominate major sectors of the economy \u2014 like commercial banking, energy production and transportation \u2014 and are very highly leveraged and often corrupt. Limiting their influence will likely trigger head-on confrontations with some high-ranking party members with ideological and financial interests in them. But the government now seems intent on doing so, partly because of these companies\u2019 inefficiencies. Which means that there are now few domestic obstacles in the way of Vietnam\u2019s joining the T.P.P. The government has agreed to allow the formation of independent labor unions at the factory level. It has been making efforts recently to comply with international human rights norms it has been known to flout, releasing several prominent activists and refraining from arresting dissidents. It is also enforcing intellectual property rights, with the police periodically raiding stores that violate copyright laws. The only major hurdle is obstructionism from China. Beijing is trying to counter Washington\u2019s strategic rebalancing toward Asia \u2014 the Obama administration\u2019s so-called pivot policy \u2014 by promoting its own free-trade zone, touting an Asia-Pacific Dream, starting a regional investment bank and pouring billions of dollars into massive infrastructure projects. It is also exerting tremendous pressure on Vietnam\u2019s leaders not to join the T.P.P., much as it did before Vietnam signed the W.T.O. agreement and the bilateral trade deal with the United States. When reports became more credible recently that the general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam would travel to the United States in June, Beijing suddenly invited him for high-level meetings in China this week.For various economic, political and strategic reasons, Vietnam can hardly afford not to join the T.P.P. But doing so will also require difficult structural adjustments, and countervailing pressure from China is intensifying. Vietnam needs, and deserves, all the support it can get from the United States. It will take no less that a concerted effort to fend off China\u2019s increasing ambitions in the region.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Matteo Renzi: Helping the Migrants Is Everyone\u2019s Duty", "Date": "2015-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorROME \u2014 The Mediterranean Sea, cradle of our civilization, is becoming a deathbed for thousands of nameless, desperate men, women and children. These people had lives full of pain, despair and hope, which led them to become victims of human trafficking. The voices of mothers who lost their children at sea will haunt our consciences. We must stop this carnage.After the latest incident \u2014 more than 800 migrants traveling between Libya and Italy perished last weekend after their boat capsized \u2014 European leaders, who are convening Thursday at my request, must revamp our response to the increase in illegal migration and human trafficking across Africa and the Mediterranean before the next tragedy.Italy\u2019s geopolitical role and location make our country a leading player in this struggle. Our rescue and patrolling efforts have saved thousands of lives. We witness the horror of overcrowded and decrepit trafficking vessels sinking in the Mediterranean, drowning their passengers. And these boats represent only the end point of massive illegal migration flows that are run by brutal organized crime networks.Italy\u2019s contempt for this unfolding drama goes beyond our role in operations. Human trafficking tramples on the values and riches that our sea has contributed to civilization. Millenniums ago, our ancestors lived along these shores, celebrating the diversity, richness and fullness of their identities. Italy and its culture are largely the product of these values and of the labor they spurred.My country will not turn a blind eye to this history. Italy will not allow these principles to be defeated.We are all partially responsible for the trafficking emergency \u2014 although I have long voiced my concerns, aware of the risk of the very bloodshed we are now witnessing. The international community\u2019s response has been insufficient.The European Union spends approximately 40 million euros yearly (about $43 million) \u2014 out of a budget of around \u20ac145 billion \u2014 on the Triton operation for sea and air patrolling of the Mediterranean. This is dramatically inadequate. The European Union must start by allocating the appropriate resources.Italy is not the desired final destination for most migrants, but we contribute a very large portion of the European search-and-rescue and patrolling efforts as well as resources to provide food, medical care and initial shelter. Italy has engaged its full capacity. This cannot be the job of a single country, no matter how well-equipped and determined we are.The European Union\u2019s contribution is of fundamental importance, but it is also insufficient. The Union should not be left alone by other countries and international bodies in its effort to manage this defining phenomenon of our time. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said earlier this week, \u201cThe Mediterranean is fast becoming a sea of misery for thousands of migrants.\u201d Migration involves us all and we must all contribute to address it.Italy supports the following proposals, which I encourage the European Council to approve on Thursday, with a view toward swift implementation.\u2022Current maritime operations by the European Union in the Mediterranean must be reinforced by at least doubling their resources and assets. We must extend their range of action beyond patrolling and border control, to a wider range of tasks allowing them to carry out a more effective mandate.\u2022European Union naval operations in the Horn of Africa have successfully fought piracy \u2014 and a similar initiative must be developed to effectively fight against human trafficking in the Mediterranean. Trafficking vessels should be put out of operation. Human traffickers are the slave traders of the 21st century, and they should be brought to justice.\u2022We need new tools, as well as additional funds, for effective coordination among Union member states and agencies for responding to asylum seekers, sheltering those in need and returning irregular migrants. We need more international officials on the ground in Africa dealing directly with migration issues. And we need to be able to effectively transfer asylum seekers from one European Union country to another, based on where they can get the best protection.The root causes for hundreds of thousands of people to desperately seek a better life, at the risk of the one they have, must be tackled more forcefully. While Africa is increasingly offering its people more opportunities, it is also posing new challenges. Conflict, failed states and epidemics still represent major threats.Advanced economies, starting with the European Union, must invest more, both in political and in economic terms, in the growth, development and stability of the African continent. Africa\u2019s future ultimately represents our own.In a very complex region, Libya presents a crucial challenge. At least 90 percent of the migrants reaching Italian ground pass through that country. Libya is prey not only to endemic instability but also to international terrorism. The Islamic State operates there, adding to the chaos of civil war.Not all passengers on traffickers\u2019 boats are innocent families. Our effort to counter terrorism in North Africa must evolve to outpace this menace, which creates fertile ground for human trafficking and interacts dangerously with it. We need to continue political and diplomatic efforts for the reconstruction of Libya.In parallel, I have increased consultations and collaboration with Italy\u2019s allies, most recently on the occasion of my meeting in Washington with President Obama, in order to devise an effective counterterrorism response.We will not be cornered by fear. Our path toward prosperity, justice and freedom will continue, guided by the light of the values that the Mediterranean gave birth to, for the benefit of all the people coming in peace to all the shores of our sea.Matteo Renzi is the prime minister of Italy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Are Rallying Around $12 Minimum Wage", "Date": "2015-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats in Congress are uniting around a proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour.Within the next several days, Senator Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate committee that deals with labor issues, plans to introduce a bill to increase the minimum wage, in steps, from its current level of $7.25 to $12 by 2020.The measure has little chance of passing the Republican-controlled Congress in the near future, but it is the latest indication of Democrats\u2019 rising ambitions for lifting the wage floor, an issue with considerable popular support in an era of increasing income inequality. The party is determined to elevate the issue in next year\u2019s congressional and presidential elections.Senator Murray\u2019s forthcoming bill, and a companion measure by Representative Robert C. Scott in the House, have considerable support within the party, according to congressional aides. Among the 15 to 20 Democrats who already back the effort in the Senate are Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, and Charles E. Schumer of New York, his chosen successor.\u201cThe politics, substance and morality coincide to make it a winner issue for us in 2016,\u201d Senator Schumer said. \u201cIt appeals not just to the people who would benefit,\u201d he added. \u201cPolling data shows it appeals to middle-class people, people of high income.\u201dMrs. Clinton has a long record of supporting minimum-wage increases, but her recently begun presidential campaign has preferred to ease into revealing the details of her policy positions, the minimum wage included.\u201cIn a deeply polarized country, the minimum wage is one of a small handful of issues that gets broad bipartisan support,\u201d wrote Dan Pfeiffer, who until recently was a senior adviser to President Obama, in an email in response to questions. \u201cThe Republican problem of opposing the minimum wage grows much worse when paired with their support of tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations. The 30-second ad writes itself.\u201dTo defuse the support, Republicans and pro-business groups have highlighted the potential job losses that could arise from minimum-wage increases. If \u201cyou just ask if people support a higher minimum wage, people support it,\u201d said Michael Saltsman, research director of the business-backed Employment Policies Institute. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting to me is when you have a follow-up question and walk them through the consequences, support really falls.\u201dBut moving substantially beyond that could lead to more significant job losses, particularly in low-wage regions of the country, said Mr. Bernstein.Perhaps the most far-reaching element of the bill is its gradual elimination of a separate minimum wage for workers who receive tips, like waiters, which currently stands at $2.13. \u201cThis is historic, truly historic,\u201d said Saru Jayaraman, co-director of Restaurant Opportunities Centers United and a leading activist on the issue.According to Ms. Jayaraman, the practice of paying substantially lower wages to tipped workers dates back to the post-Civil War era, when dining establishments and railroads hired freed slaves to work for tips and nothing else.Senator Murray\u2019s effort comes at a time of increasing momentum around the country behind changes to the minimum wage. Even some conservative states, including Arkansas, South Dakota and Alaska, raised their wage minimums by referendum last year.Last week, tens of thousands of fast-food and other low-wage workers protested in over 200 American cities in favor of a $15 an hour minimum wage.As the energy behind the movement has escalated, Democrats have become more ambitious about what they might ultimately achieve, despite continuing Republican opposition.President Obama proposed an increase to $9 an hour in his 2013 State of the Union speech, then bumped his proposal to $10.10 by the fall of that year.In 2014, the Seattle City Council voted to raise the local minimum wage to $15 an hour over a period of several years, while Chicago\u2019s moderate Democratic mayor, Rahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff to President Obama, helped win an increase of the city\u2019s minimum wage to $13 by 2019.\u201cThat momentum helped raise the awareness that there\u2019s something we can do rather than \u2018Gosh, let\u2019s put our head down because it might get defeated,\u2019 \u201d Senator Murray said.Activists say that her forthcoming legislation effectively becomes the baseline, among Democrats, for the smallest acceptable increase in the minimum wage heading into the 2016 political season.In a sign that the $12 figure could define the lower end of the debate within the party, Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, one of the chamber\u2019s more liberal members, held a rally with low-wage workers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to lift pay for employees of federal contractors to at least $15 an hour.\u201cPretty much anyone who enters the 2016 cycle not at least talking about $12 an hour is way behind the times,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a grass-roots organizing group with nearly one million members. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of entering 2016 talking about civil unions.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Considering the bounty of choices versus needs, wants, budgets and brand loyalties, it\u2019s akin to querying your barista on whom to marry.That understood, here\u2019s counsel from a reviewer who has driven more than 500 cars over the last 10 years: No vehicle makes life easier for families than a minivan. While Americans have abandoned them for crossovers, my advice is sincere. Minivans are nimbler than large sport utility vehicles, low floors make for easy loading, and children can\u2019t ding other cars with sliding doors.Kia\u2019s design team has created a deceptively elegant people hauler. It\u2019s as fashion-forward as it gets in this segment. An upward kink in the lower glass beltline is in chic contrast to the Odyssey\u2019s jolt of a lightning bolt. The Sedona\u2019s cabin quality has gone from worst to first. Plastic lumber trim looks real, leather on the SX Limited is as smooth as the baby bottoms it will haul. It\u2019s fancy enough that parents might designate Sedona a child-free zone.The Sedona carries up to eight; the top-shelf SX Limited hauls seven with reclining midrow thrones inspired by first-class airline seats. They should be for weary parents. Two caveats: The seats aren\u2019t heated and don\u2019t fold flat against the front seats to create a large cargo space, features that lower-trim models provide. Seats are not removable in the Sedona, nor is the large center console. It\u2019s easy to climb into the third row, but the stylish, tapered roofline means those over 5 feet 9 inches may find their hair restyled against their will.The Sedona\u2019s 3.3-liter V6 engine delivers 276 horsepower and 248 pound-feet of torque. The gearbox is a 6-speed, and the Sedona is pulled by the front tires. Drag-racing the soccer coach sets a bad example; know that 0-60 happens in about 7.5 seconds.Don\u2019t believe for a second that any van is remotely sporty, but driving dynamics do not get much better in this segment than in the Sedona. Kia keeps improving steering feel, though a little more communication would be nice. It\u2019s comfortable and quiet, no shouting to get a child\u2019s attention.The SX Limited\u2019s fuel economy is E.P.A. rated at 17 miles per gallon in the city and 22 on the highway; I saw 18. Lower-trim models improve on that by a few m.p.g.s. Sedona is an I.I.H.S. top safety pick. Fully loaded at $43,295, the SX Limited offers warnings for forward collision, rear cross-path and lane departure, along with radar-assisted cruise control. The \u201cbird\u2019s-eye\u201d camera system that displays the entire perimeter is a welcome feature in a large vehicle.A last bit of advice? At $26,995, the base Sedona has the same powertrain, room and design as the Limited. Crossovers may be the fashion statement families prefer these days, but arriving relaxed and happy never goes out of style.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Expected to Face Antitrust Charges in Europe", "Date": "2015-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEurope\u2019s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, is expected to make an announcement in Brussels on Wednesday that Google has abused its dominant position, according to two people who spoke Tuesday on the condition of anonymity.The decision to push ahead with a so-called statement of objections is the latest twist in the lengthy investigation into Google\u2019s activities in Europe, where it holds a roughly 90 percent share in the region\u2019s search market. If Europe is successful in making its case, the American tech giant could face a huge fine and be forced to alter its business practices to give smaller competitors like Yelp greater prominence in its search queries.A representative for Google declined to comment on any potential action by the European authorities. But in an internal memo to employees, first obtained by the technology news site Re/code, the company said it expected the commission to file a statement of objections about how the company displays search results, particularly for shopping. It also expected the authorities to open an investigation into Android, the Google software that runs a majority of the world\u2019s smartphones.\u201cWe have a very strong case, with especially good arguments when it comes to better services for users and increased competition,\u201d the memo said. \u201cAll told, consumers have a lot of choice \u2014 and they are exercising it. And many, many other companies have very successful mobile businesses \u2014 including Apple, the most valuable (mobile) company in the world.\u201d It is still unclear what specific accusations Ms. Vestager plans to include in the charges against Google. But the pressure the company faces in Europe is just one of the regulatory problems that American tech giants like Amazon, Facebook and Apple are facing across the 28-member bloc.Europe\u2019s antitrust officials have already opened investigations into whether Apple and Amazon received preferential treatment in their low-tax arrangements \u2014 Apple in Ireland and Amazon in Luxembourg. In addition, privacy watchdogs across the region are asking whether companies like Facebook have securely protected people\u2019s online data. Policy makers are also investigating whether American Internet platforms like Amazon have too much control over how Europeans gain access to online services.European lawmakers have said that these inquiries are not specifically aimed at American tech companies, though many industry executives say they are aimed at helping European tech companies, which have so far been unable to rival their much larger United States competitors.The investigation against Google has already dragged on for nearly five years at the European Commission without formal charges or a negotiated settlement. That has prompted criticism that the region\u2019s most important antitrust enforcer has been too easy on Google.Europe\u2019s main focus of investigation is whether Google has abused its search engine\u2019s large market share by favoring its own products. The search engine is more dominant in Europe than in the United States, where competitors like Microsoft\u2019s Bing have a sizable market share.Ms. Vestager, a Danish politician who took over as the European Union\u2019s top antitrust official in November, is scheduled to travel to Washington later this week, where she is expected to meet senior justice officials and participate in antitrust conferences.More than two dozen companies and organizations have filed antitrust complaints in Europe against Google. Many are in Germany, where powerful publishing groups and online firms have called on the European regulator to stop the American search giant from blocking competition in sectors like online mapping, travel services and shopping.\u201cThe E.U. competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, will decide what steps they want to go,\u201d G\u00fcnther Oettinger, a German politician who is charge of Europe\u2019s digital economy, told Die Welt am Sonntag, a German newspaper, on Sunday. \u201cI think that they will be far-reaching.\u201dIf Google fails to rebut any formal charges, Ms. Vestager could levy a fine that could exceed 6 billion euros, or $6.4 billion \u2014 about 10 percent of Google\u2019s most recent annual revenue. But the largest single fine yet levied in such a case falls well short of that mark: The record is \u20ac1.1 billion in 2009 against Intel for abusing its dominance of the computer chip market.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.The commission previously spent years reining in Microsoft, which accrued a total of almost \u20ac2 billion in European fines over a decade, including a penalty in 2013 for failing to adhere to an earlier settlement.Google still could settle the matter. But whatever the search giant might negotiate with the commission, analysts say, the deal will have a greater impact on its business than previous attempts to settle. Ms. Vestager\u2019s predecessor, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, gave Google three opportunities to make concessions that were aimed at allowing the company to escape both a fine and a formal finding of wrongdoing.Those settlement efforts repeatedly ran afoul of Google\u2019s rivals, including American companies like Microsoft and Yelp, which successfully complained that most of the changes proposed by Google have been insufficient to solve the antitrust concerns identified by regulators.\u201cEveryone should have equal treatment,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for FairSearch Europe, which represents Google rivals. \u201cGoogle should apply its own algorithm fairly to everything, including its own services.\u201dMs. Vestager has come under pressure from the European Parliament to hasten a decision since lawmakers passed a nonbinding resolution last year calling on her to consider breaking up Google.While it is unlikely that Europe could force Google to divide its current operations, the European Parliament\u2019s resolution was backed by significant numbers of lawmakers. Still, some politicians voiced concern that Europe was unfairly targeting Google.Ms. Vestager \u201cshould be congratulated for securing such swift progress,\u201d said Fredrick Federley, a Swedish member of the European Parliament.But the real challenge for Europe, he said, is to develop its own digital champions.\u201cInstead of finding ways to punish successful American companies,\u201d Mr. Federley said, \u201cwe should be asking ourselves why there are so few homegrown competitors to these giants.\u201dVindu Goel contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Looks Offshore for Wind Power", "Date": "2015-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the outskirts of Groningen, a medieval Dutch town near the German border, a major construction project is underway.Miles of high-voltage cable have already been buried in the ground. Workers recently began building an electricity substation to manage the ebbs and flows of renewable energy. And this year, ships will start to ferry giant foundations and rotor blades 50 miles into the North Sea to be part of one of the world\u2019s largest offshore wind farms.The Dutch green energy project, which will cost roughly $3 billion to build, is expected to generate enough power for 1.5 million people when it starts producing electricity in 2017.\u00a0When completed, the venture will become the latest in a series of renewables projects that have sprouted off the coasts of Britain, Germany and Denmark, helping make Europe the global leader in producing green energy from wind farms far at sea.\u00a0Europe\u2019s lead in the small but fast-growing offshore wind industry represents one of the few bright spots for the region\u2019s renewables sector, which has gradually fallen behind those in the United States and China in overall green energy investment.\u00a0While the amount of money for European onshore wind and solar projects fell roughly one-third percent last year because of Europe\u2019s weak economy, the region\u2019s offshore wind sector \u2014 buoyed by continuing government subsidies \u2014 received a record $19 billion of investment in 2014. The European industry now represents around 90 percent of all the offshore turbines that have been built worldwide, according to the data provider Bloomberg New Energy Finance.For many European countries, particularly those with long coastlines, the focus on offshore wind is a response to widespread public anger against the construction of land-based projects in densely populated areas. Analysts also say that by tapping into the strong gusts of wind at sea, offshore projects can generate almost double the electricity of comparable onshore wind farms.Europe\u2019s offshore renewables push comes just as the United States\u2019 attempts to keep pace continue to flounder because of limited government financial support, low energy prices and investor apathy.\u00a0And as Europe looks to hit its target of producing at least 20 percent of its overall energy from renewable sources by 2020, industry watchers say numerous proposed projects could potentially more than triple the amount of electricity generated from the region\u2019s offshore wind projects by the end of the decade.\u00a0\u201cSeveral countries are aggressively developing offshore wind,\u201d said Ronan O\u2019Regan, a director in the renewables practice at the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers in London. \u201cThey have taken the view that they want to be No. 1 in this sector.\u201dA number of hurdles, however, may still frustrate Europe\u2019s plans.Currently, offshore wind represents a mere 1 percent of global electricity generation. Environmental groups have raised concerns that the wind farms, often located tens of miles offshore, may affect birds\u2019 flight patterns and harm sea life.High construction costs \u2014 linked to work in harsh sea conditions \u2014 also make the electricity generated from offshore wind roughly three times as expensive as that from conventional energy sources. That has forced project developers to rely heavily on government subsidies, many of which have been cut in the last 12 months as European lawmakers rein in spending after the financial crisis.\u201cAs support is pulled back, offshore wind needs to show that it isn\u2019t just an expensive luxury,\u201d said Ben Warren, head of environmental finance at the consulting firm Ernst & Young in London. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is the world won\u2019t pay for expensive green energy forever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung Shows Signs of a Turnaround", "Date": "2015-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 After nearly two years of suffering at the hands of upstart rivals and established industry giants, Samsung may finally be on the mend.Its new high-end smartphone, the Galaxy S6, has had strong advance sales. It has replaced Qualcomm as the maker of chips for the iPhone, made by its chief competitor, Apple. And a streamlined slate of product offerings could help it compete with the low-end devices dominating the market in China.Evidence of a potential turnaround could also be found in the beleaguered South Korean manufacturer\u2019s bottom line: Samsung said on Tuesday that it expected its earnings for the first quarter of 2015 to show that the decline in its operating profit was still steep but was beginning to level off.A resurgent Samsung poses a direct challenge to China\u2019s smartphone brands, which must find a way to compete outside of their home market with major multinationals. The early popularity of the S6 could make it difficult for Chinese companies to do that with high-end offerings, said Bryan Ma, an analyst at the research company IDC.\u201cYou look at Huawei and ZTE\u201d and other Chinese companies, Mr. Ma said. \u201cTheir ambition is to move out of the low end into the premium end, so they\u2019re trying to move up that curve as well.\u201dMr. Ma added that it would be difficult for Samsung to make money at the lower end. \u201cIt\u2019s such a bloody price war down there,\u201d he said.Intense competition at the low and high ends of the smartphone market has eroded Samsung\u2019s status as the world\u2019s best-selling smartphone brand, according to IDC.Some of Samsung\u2019s biggest troubles have come from China, where it has struggled to compete in the low end with companies like Huawei and Xiaomi. The period of torrid growth in China\u2019s market is moderating, but analysts expect new booms in other heavily populated developing markets, like India and Southeast Asia.For Samsung, that sets up new fronts of competition where the company can take advantage of its brand recognition, marketing and experience selling across the globe to push back against Chinese rivals. For instance, in India in the fourth quarter of last year, Samsung had a 22 percent market share, compared with Xiaomi\u2019s 4 percent, according to IDC.The release of the S6 may help offset the stellar performance of the iPhone 6, while also putting more pressure on smaller rivals trying to make a name \u2014 and bigger profits \u2014 for themselves with flashy, expensive flagship devices.\u201cI think the reason Samsung struggled last year is they just looked boring,\u201d said Peter Yu, an analyst at BNP Paribas. He pointed out that the Galaxy model from 2014 was little different from the 2013 version.\u201cEveryone caught up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it came to Android phones, everything now just looks the same. If you cover up the brand, you couldn\u2019t tell the difference between the Chinese smartphones and the Samsung smartphones.\u201dThe way the S6 now stands out from the crowd should help the company improve sales at the top end, where it makes the bulk of its profits. Samsung has not released official figures, but the South Korean news media have reported that the company has already sold 20 million units of the S6 in advance to cellphone carriers. The S6 goes on sale to the public on Friday.Mr. Yu said Samsung\u2019s new strategy with its lower-end and midrange smartphones could also help the company this year. Where before Samsung offered a large variety of lower-end smartphones, it now offers a single series \u2014 an attempt, according to Mr. Yu, to take advantage of economies of scale and increase profit margins.He said that Nokia used to make 20 percent profit margins on phones that it sold for 40 euros, or about $44. \u201cI think Samsung is trying to emulate that,\u201d Mr. Yu said.On the semiconductor front, Samsung will be helped both by smartphone companies\u2019 buying more and more memory chips, and by the resurgence of the company\u2019s microprocessor business.Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at IBK Securities, said that in particular, Samsung\u2019s supplying Apple with the A9 chip for the next iPhone would be a big boon to profits in the second half of the year. It is not certain how many chips Samsung will deliver to Apple, but given the popularity of the iPhone 6, which uses the A8 chip, the number is likely to be in the tens of millions.But Samsung\u2019s television business could struggle, analysts said, and the company still faces huge challenges competing with Apple.Ben Thompson, an independent technology analyst at Stratechery.com, said the success of the S6 phone was far from guaranteed. Samsung is \u201ctesting the thesis that phone quality matters,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cMy thesis is that it\u2019s the software that gives Apple its lock on the high end (plus brand), so I\u2019m skeptical.\u201dIn a news release on Tuesday, Samsung said its operating profit in the first three months of 2015 most likely fell about 30 percent, compared with the same period in 2014. That suggests a moderation from the final quarter of last year, when operating profit fell 36 percent from the same period a year earlier.Despite the drop, Samsung exceeded analyst expectations by forecasting an operating profit of about 5.9 trillion won, or $5.4 billion, in the first quarter, down from 8.5 trillion won a year earlier. Sales were estimated at about 47 trillion won, down roughly 12 percent from 53.7 trillion won a year earlier. The figures are preliminary; Samsung will post final earnings later this month.Market share statistics show how much Samsung\u2019s status as the global smartphone champion has been eaten away. In a report for the fourth quarter of 2014, IDC noted that Apple\u2019s total unit sales nearly tied Samsung\u2019s. In the same period a year earlier, Samsung sold 33 million more handsets than Apple.If Apple has nearly tied Samsung in device sales, the Chinese upstarts that have been competing with Samsung in the lower-end segment still lag far behind. In the fourth quarter, Samsung\u2019s global market share was 20 percent, compared with roughly 4 percent to 7 percent for each of its major Chinese rivals: Lenovo, Huawei and Xiaomi.\u201cWhat remains to be seen is how the vendors beyond Samsung and Apple will assert themselves,\u201d Ramon T. Llamas, an analyst at IDC, wrote in the report. \u201dWith Lenovo acquiring Motorola, and Xiaomi having greater aspirations beyond China, the competitive pressure will come more from below and less from above,\u201d he added. \u201cThis will make the smartphone race continuously competitive as 2015 shapes up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trader Arrested in Manipulation That Contributed to 2010 \u2018Flash Crash\u2019", "Date": "2015-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive years ago, the global financial system was rocked by the \u201cflash crash,\u201d 15 minutes of chaos that shook the world\u2019s biggest markets and prompted investors both big and small to question how such a vital part of the economy could be brought to its knees.On Tuesday, United States prosecutors said that much of the blame for the event could be pinned on a single person: a 36-year-old man who had been boldly manipulating markets from his suburban rowhouse just a few minutes from Heathrow Airport outside London, where he was arrested. For the latest case, it took the authorities five years to track down a rogue actor making enormous trades. And, they were led to him only with the help of an outside whistle-blower.\u201cI\u2019m dumbfounded that they missed this until now,\u201d said Eric Hunsader, founder of the market data company Nanex, who has been critical of the regulatory efforts to crack down on problematic high-frequency trading.Mr. Sarao is accused of entering and withdrawing thousands of orders worth tens of millions of dollars each on hundreds of trading days, in an attempt to push down the price of futures contracts tied to the value of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, a practice known as spoofing. Once the price fell, Mr. Sarao would buy the contract and reap the profits, according to the criminal complaint.Mr. Sarao, who was in British custody on Tuesday pending an extradition request from the United States, faces charges of wire fraud and commodities fraud among other counts. A lawyer for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the futures markets, said that the agency was not pinning the blame on the crash solely on Mr. Sarao.\u201cI\u2019m not ready to go that far,\u201d said Aitan Goelman, director of enforcement at the commission. But he added that Mr. Sarao\u2019s actions played a noticeable role. \u201cHis conduct was significantly responsible for the order unbalance, which was one of the conditions that led\u201d to the crash, Mr. Goelman said in a call with journalists.Prosecutors said that Mr. Sarao made $40 million trading the same futures contracts over four years.Mr. Sarao\u2019s lawyer could not be identified on Tuesday.The complaint against Mr. Sarao, filed in Chicago, could be particularly problematic for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is one of the world\u2019s largest trading arenas and handled the trades in question.Mr. Sarao had faced questions from the exchange about his trading activity long before the flash crash. But there are no indications that the exchange ever took action against him, and Mr. Sarao continued trading in much the same way until this month, the complaint said. At one point in 2010, Mr. Sarao said in an email that he had called the exchange, in response to its questions, \u201cand told \u2019em to kiss my ass.\u201dThe Chicago exchange and other American exchanges have come under scrutiny because they are tasked with policing their members but rely on those same members for revenues, creating an incentive to not come down too hard on them.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which handles trading in options and futures contracts, said it could not comment on the case because the inquiry is continuing.In the end, the government found Mr. Sarao after a whistle-blower went to the C.M.E.\u2019s federal regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This whistle-blower, who is remaining anonymous publicly but is known to American regulators, went to the commission \u201cafter hundreds of hours spent analyzing data and other information,\u201d according to a lawyer representing the person.Federal authorities have been under more pressure to identify malicious behavior in the markets since last spring, when the author Michael Lewis published \u201cFlash Boys,\u201d which drew much public attention to the potential problems created by high-frequency traders.Since then, the authorities appear to have stepped up their scrutiny of the markets and have taken more aggressive action against bad actors.Mr. Hunsader, the founder of Nanex who has been critical of the regulators, said that the legal actions do appear to have \u201cput the fear of God\u201d in many market participants, though he said the type of manipulation that Mr. Sarao is being accused of is still common.The case will play into the heated debate over whether investors have been hurt by the increasing presence of high-speed traders, who account for more than half of the activity in most of the largest trading markets. Since the flash crash, there have been a number of other disruptive events that have unnerved investors, including the implosion of Knight Capital, after a faulty algorithm caused the company to lose more than $400 million in under an hour.Lawrence R. Glosten, one of the authors of the paper, and a professor at Columbia Business School, said he did not believe that the behavior of people like Mr. Sarao is likely to be terribly damaging to the markets, but he added that there had not been enough inquiry into how common such manipulation may be.Peter Eavis and Ben Protess contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

That bill, which also has bipartisan support, would create incentives for federal mortgage writers to incorporate energy-efficient heating and cooling systems into the value of a home, establish training programs in energy-efficiency construction, create programs to increase the energy efficiency of manufacturing supply chains, and direct the Energy Department to work with manufacturers on energy-efficient technology.But efforts to bring the bill to the Senate floor have been thwarted by partisan debates over issues like climate change and the Keystone XL oil pipeline.This year, the senators introduced a bill that incorporated a few elements of the broader measure. The narrower bill would create a voluntary program for landlords and tenants to improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings, mandate that large electric water heaters be run in a highly energy-efficient manner and require federal agencies to perform energy-use assessments on commercial buildings that they lease.That measure was passed by a voice vote at 4 a.m. on March 27, at the end of an all-night voting session on amendments to a budget bill.

Mr. Obama worked for him at Harvard Law School, where Mr. Tribe has taught for four decades.To Republicans who oppose Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change agenda, Mr. Tribe is a celebrated convert. \u201cWhen I saw the brief, I thought, this is dazzling,\u201d said Michael McKenna, a Washington energy lobbyist. \u201cAnd the fact that it was written by a guy on the other side made it even better.\u201dMr. Tribe\u2019s legal claims, they concluded, are \u201cridiculous.\u201dMr. Tribe dismissed the criticism and said that his brief and comments reflect his views as a constitutional scholar, not as a paid advocate for the coal company. \u201cI\u2019m not for sale,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll say what I believe.\u201d\u201cI feel very comfortable with my relationship with Peabody,\u201d he added. \u201cSomebody wanted my help and it happened to coincide with what I believe.\u201dBut a number of legal scholars and current and former members of the Obama administration say that Mr. Tribe has eroded his credibility by using his platform as a scholar to promote a corporate agenda \u2014 specifically, the mining and burning of coal.The comment also has phrases frequently used by the coal industry. The use of such language, Ms. Freeman and Mr. Lazarus suggested, is typical of paid industry advocates but not of impartial scholars. \u201cThe best way to evaluate his claims is to treat them as advocacy and not scholarship,\u201d Ms. Freeman and Mr. Lazarus wrote.Anger from within the Obama administration about Mr. Tribe\u2019s actions is particularly fierce, although officials declined to comment on the record for fear of escalating the situation.\u201cWhether he intended it or not, Tribe has been weaponized by the Republican Party in an orchestrated takedown of the president\u2019s climate plan,\u201d said one former administration official.Thomas Reynolds, a spokesman for the E.P.A., reacted to Mr. Tribe\u2019s brief by saying that agency officials remained confident in the legal arguments behind the regulations. \u201cWe have a recent record of court wins, proving our work is grounded in a sound understanding of the law,\u201d Mr. Reynolds said in an email.Mr. Tribe said he could not help it if Republicans embraced his arguments.

{"Headline": "Vivendi in Talks to Buy 80% Stake in Dailymotion", "Date": "2015-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The French conglomerate Vivendi is trying to revamp the fortunes of Dailymotion, a video-sharing website that has long struggled to live up to its early promise as the next YouTube.Vivendi, which also owns the Universal Music Group, on Tuesday entered exclusive talks to buy an 80 percent stake in Dailymotion for about 217 million euros, or about $235 million, from the French telecommunications giant Orange.The companies confirmed those talks in a joint statement after Orange\u2019s board met Tuesday afternoon in Paris to discuss Vivendi\u2019s offer.The negotiations come after a series of interventions by the French government, which owns a 25 percent stake in Orange. Paris has long pushed for Dailymotion, which was founded in 2005, to emerge a viable alternative to YouTube, which is owned by Google.Not only are YouTube\u2019s nearly 800 million monthly unique visitors more than six times what Dailymotion attracts, analysts say that Google has been more successful at attracting advertisers and finding other forms of revenue compared with Dailymotion under French ownership. In the United States, for example, about 60 percent of Internet users routinely visit YouTube, compared with just 7 percent who regularly use Dailymotion, according to the data provider eMarketer.Orange, which would retain a minority holding in the video-sharing company, acquired a 49 percent stake in Dailymotion in 2011 at the urging of the French government and bought the remaining stake in 2013. But analysts say Dailymotion has never been a good fit for Orange\u2019s telecommunications business.Stephane Richard, Orange\u2019s chief executive, said his company would use the proceeds of a Vivendi deal to invest in its other digital businesses.Dailymotion was recently put into play again after a Hong Kong-based conglomerate, PCCW, showed interest in buying a stake in the company. PCCW broke off acquisition talks on Monday after the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, voiced doubts over a non-European company\u2019s buying a stake in Dailymotion.\u201cThe French government\u2019s preferred search for a European solution discourages international companies\u2019 participation,\u201d PCCW said in a statement.Vivendi\u2019s bid for Dailymotion has put a focus on the future plans of Vivendi itself.After selling billions of dollars of telecommunications assets in the last few years, Vivendi is trying to transform itself into a media company centered on Universal Music, the world\u2019s largest music company, and the Canal Plus cable television and film group.\u201cDailymotion certainly has a sizable audience, but it has definitely not grown as fast as YouTube,\u201d said Thomas Husson, an analyst at the technology research company Forrester Research in Paris. \u201cWith Vivendi\u2019s focus on media, this deal could help them offer content on online premium channels that would not be available elsewhere.\u201dAs Europe\u2019s telecommunications industry undergoes an overhaul, Orange has repeatedly said it would prefer an external partner to help develop Dailymotion.As YouTube has been able to take advantage of Google\u2019s wide reach across the Internet, including through online search, email and other services, analysts also questioned whether Vivendi would be able to use its global operations and exclusive video and music content to help Dailymotion catch up with its larger rival.\u201cThe odds of building a video aggregation and streaming business which can compete with YouTube are low,\u201d said Claudio Aspesi, an analyst at Bernstein. \u201cIt is a small deal and, in the end, it is unlikely to move the needle much in terms of the economics.\u201dWhile Vivendi, which is based in Paris, looks to secure a majority stake in Dailymotion, the company\u2019s own strategic shift to focus on its media assets is the source of a shareholder revolt.An American hedge fund, P. Schoenfeld Asset Management, known as PSAM, has called on Vivendi to hand shareholders \u20ac9 billion of proceeds from divestments, raise its dividend and sell Universal Music.Some investors are also challenging the company\u2019s plan to grant double voting rights for long-term shareholders. Vivendi\u2019s management, which has bet the company\u2019s future on its existing strategy, has rejected those demands.To head off the revolt, Vincent Bollor\u00e9, Vivendi\u2019s biggest shareholder and one of France\u2019s richest men, has been increasing his personal stake in the company, and now holds just more than 12 percent, up from 8.15 percent before the challenge. Shareholders are expected to discuss these issues at the company\u2019s shareholders\u2019 meeting on April 17.Mark Scott reported from London, and David Jolly from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Limits of Outsmarting a Strong Dollar", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you buy foreign stocks, you get stakes in foreign companies and also the currencies they do business in. If you have been invested abroad over the last year or so, there is a good chance that you have been happy with the first part. But the currency exposure? Probably not.The dollar rose 9 percent against a standard basket of currencies in the four quarters through March, leaving it close to a 12-year high and curtailing or even eliminating the gains on foreign stocks when expressed in dollars.You can limit susceptibility to currency fluctuations by choosing certain managers or types of funds, but you may not want to. Because big moves tend to be reversed over time, investment advisers say the best way to handle currencies in a long-term portfolio is to all but ignore them.\u201cIf you\u2019re buying a fund for the long haul, currency should sort itself out back to neutral because currencies ebb and flow,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, director of fund research at S&P Capital IQ. \u201cYou should be cognizant of currency movements, but I don\u2019t think they should be a major factor when choosing an international fund.\u201dBut the rally in the dollar has persuaded many investors to buy hedged E.T.F.s \u2014 exchange-traded funds that use derivative instruments to nullify the impact of currency movements. Assets in these funds, which are offered by WisdomTree Investments, BlackRock\u2019s iShares and Deutsche Bank\u2019s X-Trackers, more than tripled in the 12 months through March, to $47 billion, according to Morningstar, mainly through new investment. Assets in all international stock E.T.F.s rose 26 percent during that span.\u201cThere have been heavy flows into those products, and they have significantly outperformed their actively managed peers because most funds that invest abroad don\u2019t hedge their currency exposure,\u201d said Patricia Oey, an analyst at Morningstar who specializes in E.T.F.s.The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Japan E.T.F., for example, rose 16.4 percent in the four quarters through March, compared with 12 percent for Japan mutual funds and 10.6 percent for the unhedged iShares Japan E.T.F. The outperformance was sizable for hedged Europe E.T.F.s, too.Over longer periods, hedged and unhedged E.T.F.s have performed roughly the same, Ms. Oey said, but the hedging process adds to a fund\u2019s costs, putting a drag on returns for buy-and-hold investors, so she considers hedged E.T.F.s better as trading vehicles. Even then, they may not be suitable for many investors.\u201cThey\u2019re good for a short-term trade, but it\u2019s probably more trouble than it\u2019s worth,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could have a lot of taxable capital gains, and there are commissions, and you might get it wrong\u201d and buy at a bad time.Jeremy Schwartz, director of research at WisdomTree, thinks that hedged E.T.F.s make useful long-term holdings. He called the widespread belief that they do not \u201cthe biggest misconception there is when people address this topic.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no model that says currencies produce an expected positive return,\u201d he said, looking at the long-term impact, or lack of it, from a different angle. \u201cSo what is the point of taking currency risk?\u201dThe point to Ms. Oey is that some markets, including ones like Japan for which hedged E.T.F.s have been popular, feature an inverse correlation between stocks and currency values. By eliminating currency risk, investors may be increasing risk over all, she said, although she noted that the inverse relationship between currencies and stocks does not apply to all markets.With global stocks performing well and the dollar strong, owners of hedged E.T.F.s are having their cake and eating it, too. But what happens when feast gives way to famine and the dollar starts giving up its gains? That\u2019s when manager discretion can come in handy.\u201cThe good thing about actively managed mutual funds is that they can always take a hedge off, but a hedged product is always hedged,\u201d Mr. Rosenbluth said. Referring to the dollar\u2019s strength, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t have the expertise to tell you when that stops, but at some point international currencies should do well.\u201dBut most fund managers readily concede that they do not have the expertise, either, so they do not make currency calls or hedge their exposure. They would rather look for solid companies to invest in based on the usual criteria \u2014 growth prospects, valuation, financial and managerial strength \u2014 and consider the currency backdrop only to the extent that it influences those factors.\u201cAs a general rule we do not hedge,\u201d said Jamie Doyle, co-manager of the Causeway International Value fund. One reason, he said, is that \u201cit\u2019s often difficult to know what the underlying hedge should be.\u201dIt would be easy enough to figure out with one of his holdings, KDDI, a Japanese mobile phone service provider whose sales are almost entirely in yen, he noted, but another one, Toyota, has costs and sales all over the world. Toyota itself hedges, Mr. Doyle added, and is long the dollar, so anyone who hedged a position in Toyota could be more exposed to the dollar than an investor who owned the same stake in an American company.Bryan Lloyd, co-manager of the Harding Loevner International Equity fund, doesn\u2019t hedge, either. Even so, he makes it a point to ensure that companies he is contemplating buying have a rough balance between the currencies of their sales and costs.\u201cWe spend a fair amount of time analyzing what exposures businesses might have,\u201d Mr. Lloyd said. \u201cIf we find a material mismatch that may affect a company\u2019s financial strength, we won\u2019t own it.\u201d He is especially wary of banks for which the currencies of its loans and deposits are out of whack.Nick Kaiser, manager of the Sextant International Fund, finds that currency effects balance out in other ways. With the euro depressed, the yachts and motorboats that the French company Beneteau makes are more affordable for Americans. But Beneteau\u2019s vessels are just as expensive for anyone paying in euros, he pointed out, and with the euro cheap because Europe\u2019s economy is struggling, seafarers there are less likely to be in the market for one.SOME portfolio managers do hedge. Evermore Global Advisors uses derivatives called forward contracts to eliminate exposure, much as hedged E.T.F.s do. David Marcus, Evermore\u2019s chief executive, acknowledged Mr. Doyle\u2019s concern, that the hedging activity of some companies in a portfolio, combined with the manager\u2019s, could create too much dollar exposure from an individual holding. But any imbalance across a portfolio is unlikely, Mr. Marcus said.\u201cIf you do not hedge, then you are implicitly making a currency call,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to rise or fall based on our ability to find compelling investments,\u201d not because of foreign-exchange movements, he said.That is the logic underpinning hedged E.T.F.s, although they do not use active stock picking to fill their portfolios. Ms. Oey still contends that it is more sensible for someone with a long horizon to invest abroad through more conventional vehicles.\u201cFor long-term investors,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s probably better just to go with a good mutual fund with a good manager or with a cheap, broadly diversified E.T.F.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Begins Her Presidential Quest", "Date": "2015-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetters To the Editor:The only way for Hillary Rodham Clinton to win the presidency is to run as an unapologetic Democrat. The idea that crucial \u201cindependent\u201d voters are moderate is mistaken. As Mrs. Clinton herself understood in 2008, when she mocked Barack Obama for his appeals to bipartisanship, there are no moderates anymore.And there\u2019s certainly nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 she can do or say that won\u2019t be viciously distorted and attacked by Republicans during the campaign and, if she wins, when she\u2019s in office. Certainly, if she disavows Mr. Obama, as Al Gore disavowed Bill Clinton in 2000, she\u2019ll earn herself nothing but contempt and defeat.Understanding who\u2019s on her side \u2014 the clear majority of voting-age Americans, I believe \u2014 Mrs. Clinton should enlist President Obama to campaign for her among African-Americans and her husband to campaign for her among white Southerners, and both of them to reach out to young people. She herself should concentrate on energizing and inspiring women of all backgrounds to vote in record numbers.That\u2019s the way Mrs. Clinton will win, and, after winning, the way that she\u2019ll be able to accomplish something as president.BILL ADLERNew YorkTo the Editor:Your article tells of the pressure on Hillary Rodham Clinton to reinvent herself yet once again to appeal to a winning percentage of the electorate.The Ready for Hillary folks and Clinton staff members are working around the clock to bring the country a reinvented candidate who can win. It will be tough. They will have to design a candidate who does not stand with President Obama on domestic and foreign affairs. They will have to explain away the failures when she was secretary of state. They will have to show some accomplishments when she was in the Senate.They will have to have a candidate who has the trust of the American people and who is honest. No more controversies over Whitewater and legal billing issues. The new Hillary Clinton will have to be transparent, obey disclosure laws and account for Benghazi.If Mrs. Clinton\u2019s war room can do all this, she might have a chance. Or we could have one of the other candidates who doesn\u2019t need image consultants to reinvent himself or herself to fool us.Let\u2019s have a candidate who stands for something and believes in it, unless all we want is the first woman and grandmother to become president.PAUL J. BURGDORFLatham, N.Y.To the Editor:Now that she has announced, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton needs to walk a fine line between being her own candidate versus someone who helped shape the Obama presidency. After two terms of a Democratic presidency, Republicans are betting that the electorate has grown weary of having a Democrat in the White House.The only trouble with their strategy is this: Under Mr. Obama, the economy has dramatically improved; millions of people have found work; both the stock market and consumer confidence are high; the price of oil is down; and a majority of voters approve of the way the president has negotiated with Iran. To the extent that Mrs. Clinton hitches her wagon to these accomplishments, she\u2019ll be in a position to leave the G.O.P. in the dust.Having been a student of politics since the 1960s, I realize a lot can happen to a candidate over the course of the next year and a half. But I think it will be the G.O.P., not Mrs. Clinton, that has the steeper mountain to climb in 2016.DENNY FREIDENRICHLaguna Beach, Calif.To the Editor:I would like more journalists in this country to commit themselves to reporting only on the issues in the next presidential election. I do not care how Hillary Rodham Clinton looks, dresses, lacks Bill\u2019s oratory skills or fails to connect with the voters in Iowa who expect her to come into their homes.I do care about the issues \u2014 income inequality, job growth, investing in our infrastructure, nuclear negotiations with Iran and the Affordable Care Act. Maybe if more journalists stuck to the issues, it would become more the norm.Al Gore received the majority of the popular vote in 2000. I believe that his majority would have been even higher had journalists not harped on his decision to wear more earth tones or poked fun at his idea to shore up Social Security with a lockbox or discussed how people would prefer to have a beer with George W. Bush. In their desire to be witty, these journalists are doing a disservice to the electorate.BRIDGET BOHACZGlen Burnie, Md.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Power Dynamics Shifting Amid Political Scandals", "Date": "2015-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn some democracies, figures facing such situations might find themselves banished from public life even if they were never convicted. But not in Brazil, where the men who command the scandal-plagued Congress are actually increasing their power over the scandal-plagued president, Dilma Rousseff.The move reflects one of the most profound shifts in political power in the country in decades \u2014 and is a clear measure of the troubles Ms. Rousseff now faces in the wake of a sweeping bribery case involving Brazil\u2019s national oil company.\u201cThis is \u2018House of Cards,\u2019 Brazilian style, with the chiefs in Congress seizing a moment when the president is very weak,\u201d said David Fleischer, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Bras\u00edlia. \u201cThey are putting into motion a strategy of simply letting Dilma dangle in the wind,\u201d he added.The strategy seems to be working. While both Mr. Cunha and Mr. Calheiros are on the list of dozens of political figures under investigation in connection with the bribery scandal, the congressional leaders appear to be deflecting attention from their own troubles by revolting against Ms. Rousseff, whose public approval rating stands at a dismal 13 percent.In doing so, they have managed to largely shield the Brazilian Congress from blame. Its own bleak approval rating climbed to 11 percent in April from 9 percent in March, according to Datafolha, a prominent Brazilian polling company. The survey, conducted through interviews with 2,834 people, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points. The scandal involved executives at Petrobras accepting vast amounts of bribes, enriching themselves while also channeling funds to political figures and to Ms. Rousseff\u2019s leftist Workers Party, according to testimony by former executives.As Ms. Rousseff and her party reel from the scandal, she is facing a rebellion from the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, which has anchored her coalition and controls both houses of Congress.Both Mr. Calheiros, the Senate leader, and Mr. Cunha, the speaker of the lower house, are members of the rebelling party. Ms. Rousseff\u2019s own vice president, Michel Temer, is the leader of the PMDB, as the party is known, and Mr. Temer is bolstering his own power after the president appealed to him to ease tensions with Congress.While both are adopting stances clashing with those of Ms. Rousseff, Mr. Calheiros and Mr. Cunha themselves do not see eye to eye on everything, taking different positions, for instance, on a bill aiming to make it easier for companies to outsource some operations.Cristovam Buarque, a respected senator on the left who voted against Ms. Rousseff in the recent election, said the growing sway over the president by the troika formed by the heads of Congress and the vice president amounted to a \u201ccoup.\u201d\u201cInstead of a general, a brigadier and an admiral acting with the support of the armed forces, we have the vice president of the republic and the chiefs of Congress maneuvering with the support of the troops of the PMDB,\u201d Mr. Buarque said.Few federal legislators ever face imprisonment for any crimes because of the special judicial standing enjoyed by all 594 members of Congress allowing them to be tried only in Brazil\u2019s Supreme Federal Tribunal, effectively producing years of delays in a court overwhelmed with examining many other pressing issues in Brazilian society.After facing scandals in the past, the figures now at the helm of Congress have shown an exceptional ability to withstand the allegations and resurrect their fortunes. Both Mr. Calheiros, the head of the Senate, and Mr. Cunha, the head of the lower house, have asserted that they are innocent in connection to the bribery scheme at Petrobras.Mr. Calheiros, 59, did not respond to requests for comment about the other claims of corruption he has faced. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cunha, 56, said that he denied wrongdoing in each of the corruption accusations against him, emphasizing that he pursued legal action against the news organizations that reported on some of the cases in an effort to \u201cre-establish the truth.\u201dAs Ms. Rousseff battles for her political survival, Mr. Cunha, an evangelical Christian radio commentator and economist, is raising his national profile in appearances around Brazil, championing a socially conservative agenda and suggesting that the PMDB, which acquiesced for years to some of the Workers Party\u2019s objectives, is forging its own distinct political ambitions.\u201cThe majority of society thinks as we think,\u201d Mr. Cunha told a gathering of evangelical Christians in Rio de Janeiro in March, contending that protests against him by gay rights activists were the work of a \u201cminority.\u201dSeparately, Mr. Cunha has said that the advance of legislation expanding legal access to abortions in Brazil would have to take place over his \u201ccadaver.\u201d Abortion remains illegal in Brazil in most circumstances, allowed only when the woman has been raped, her life is in danger or if the fetus has a severe defect in which parts of the brain and skull are missing.Eying the rising clout of Congress under leaders like Mr. Cunha, some observers are cautioning the president to proceed carefully if she hopes to resuscitate her presidency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The James Dean Movie That Explains the Greek Debt Negotiations", "Date": "2015-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh-Stakes TalksIf you are the finance minister of a country, and word goes out that your role in crucial negotiations is being reduced, and your country\u2019s cost to borrow plummets, it is not generally seen as an endorsement of your skills. It is the government equivalent of a corporate chief executive resigning and the company\u2019s stock soaring.Markets were parsing the personnel shifts for signs of whether the negotiations would end in a Greek debt default or exit from the euro currency area, events that could ripple through the global economy in dangerous, hard-to-predict ways. But for another way to understand the events in Europe, it helps to look to a 1955 James Dean movie.The simple version of the Greek talks is this: A new, leftist government came to power in Greece in January, pledging to rework the country\u2019s arrangements with international creditors and thus ease the severe austerity measures that have devastated the Greek economy. The creditors, namely other European countries, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, have been willing to make some concessions but basically expect Greece to make good on its obligations.The negotiations between Greece and its creditors are a classic game of chicken, a rather more complex version of the one in \u201cRebel Without a Cause.\u201d Jim Stark, James Dean\u2019s character in that film, is challenged to a \u201cChickie Run,\u201d in which he and his rival, Buzz, drive stolen cars toward a cliff, with the loser being the young man who jumps to safety first.What makes a game of chicken scary is that each competitor needs to risk his life to get the best outcome. The safest thing for the rivals to have done would have been to jump out of their cars to safety immediately (or perhaps never get in them at all), but that would mean conceding total victory to their opponent.Similarly, the Greek government is most likely to get agreeable terms the closer a Greek exit from the eurozone, with its attendant unpredictable fallout, appears.Part of what has been happening the last several weeks is that everyone is trying to assess just how bad that outcome would be. If their cars go over the cliff, does it mean certain death or mere injury? If the latter, both parties are likely to hold out longer, and the risk of going over the cliff thus would become higher.From the creditors\u2019 standpoint, it is clearly the case that Europe would be in better position to weather a Greek exit from the eurozone than a few years ago during the height of the Continent\u2019s crisis. There is a stronger, centralized firewall from the European Central Bank to prevent the Greek crisis from rippling across in the form of bank failures and government defaults in countries like Spain and Portugal.From Greece\u2019s standpoint, an exit from the eurozone has even more straightforward negatives. A newly introduced currency would plummet, leaving its citizens poorer amid likely high inflation and further economic contraction. It might set the stage for future growth, but it would be a painful few years, which is why Greek public opinion polls strongly oppose such a move, and the government has consistently pledged not to let it happen.To try to keep from going over the cliff, the Greek government seems to be changing drivers. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras assured that Mr. Varoufakis would remain in charge of the team, but that a deputy foreign minister would take over the day-to-day negotiating.It is an open question whether the Greeks will prove more open to substantive concessions than they were before the change. It is possible that the personal distrust that had built between Mr. Varoufakis and the other European finance ministers was standing in the way of a potential accord; on the other, it may be that his hard-edge stance was the path to the best outcome for the Greek people, who would like to see endless cuts to pensions and wages end.Either way, it\u2019s useful to remember what happened in \u201cRebel Without a Cause.\u201dThings didn\u2019t work out well for Buzz \u2014 his sleeve got caught on the door handle and he went off the cliff and perished. But they didn\u2019t work out too well for the ostensible winner, either, who spent the rest of the movie dealing with the legal and moral fallout of a failed game of chicken.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "FedEx Agrees to Acquire TNT Express in $4.8 Billion Deal", "Date": "2015-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe all-cash deal announced on Tuesday would greatly expand FedEx\u2019s presence in Europe, where it has sought to compete with DHL Express of Germany and UPS, its principal American rival. With the acquisition FedEx would get access to TNT\u2019s extensive road delivery network.The deal comes two years after European regulators blocked a bid for TNT by UPS over concerns that it would decrease competition and increase prices.But FedEx and TNT were confident that their deal would pass antitrust muster. A combination would create a stronger rival to DHL and UPS, which together control about two-thirds of the European express delivery market.And the FedEx deal is \u201cmuch simpler\u201d than the previously proposed UPS transaction, as there is much less overlap between the two companies, said Antony Burgmans, TNT\u2019s chairman.\u201cWe are far more complementary than what was the case with UPS. This means that the synergies will be less,\u201d he said at a news conference. \u201cBut, on the other hand, the strategic fit is better.\u201dAs part of the transaction, TNT has agreed to sell its airline operations, including its cargo services, because the European Commission restricts foreign ownership of airlines in Europe.Under the terms of the deal, FedEx will pay 8 euros a share in cash for each outstanding share of TNT, a 33 percent premium to the stock\u2019s closing price on Thursday, the last day it was traded before the Easter holiday in Europe. The offer values TNT at about \u20ac4.4 billion, or about $4.8 billion.Since UPS withdrew its offer for TNT in January 2013, the value of the euro has declined more than 19 percent in value against the dollar.On Tuesday, FedEx executives cited the strong dollar, as well as signs of improvement in Europe, as among the reasons for the deal.David J. Bronczek, the president and chief executive of FedEx Express, the company\u2019s main operating unit, also noted that buying TNT gave FedEx access to an existing road delivery network, including 550 hubs and depots, that would be much more costly for FedEx to build on its own.TNT\u2019s executive and supervisory boards have unanimously recommended that shareholders accept the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2016. PostNL, the Dutch mail service that owns 14.7 percent of TNT, has agreed to support the deal.\u201cWe know that there are two strong players in the marketplace. Now there will be three,\u201d Mr. Bronczek said at the news conference in Amsterdam on Tuesday. \u201cAt the end of the day, what the commission and what the regulatory authorities would like to see is better competition.\u201dIn 2013, DHL had a 41 percent market share in the European international express market, according to data on DHL\u2019s website, which also shows that UPS had a 25 percent market share. TNT accounted for 12 percent of the market, and FedEx accounted for 10 percent.FedEx, which has been operating in Europe for about 30 years, had about 210 million shipments into and out of Europe last year and provides next-day service to about 86 percent of the market, Mr. Bronczek said.\u201cYou now have two strong competitors and two weak competitors,\u201d Mr. Burgmans said. \u201cNow you have three very large ones who will fight very hard for the favor of the customers. In the end, I think that will be a better-quality offering.\u201dFounded in 1946, TNT, based in Hoofddorp, the Netherlands, delivers documents, packages and freight to more than 200 countries and territories, according to its website. It has 65,000 employees and posted revenue of \u20ac6.7 billion in 2013. It handles about one million shipments a day.FedEx said that it intended to finance the offer through cash as well as existing and new debt. The agreement includes a \u20ac200 million breakup fee.Based in Memphis, FedEx is one of the world\u2019s largest providers of delivery services. The company posted revenue of $45.6 billion in 2014 and has more than 300,000 employees. It handles more than 10.5 million shipments a day.FedEx is being advised by JPMorgan Chase and the law firms NautaDutilh and Baker & McKenzie, while TNT is being advised by Goldman Sachs, Lazard and the law firm Allen & Overy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buying Apartment Buildings in New York and Beyond in a Strategic Bet", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySmall BusinessWhen Luis Rinaldini, co-founder of Groton Merchant Bankers, wanted to add New York apartment buildings to the firm\u2019s investment portfolio in 2010, he took a chance on two young college graduates to make it happen.It was an unusual and risky bet. After all, Graham Jones and his brother Gregory had no real estate experience and little more than college degrees, unbridled ambition and a lot of chutzpah. It was also a time when the economy had tumbled into the worst recession since the Great Depression. But the two brothers saw a chance to scoop up real estate at bargain prices.\u201cIn the midst of chaos is when you really have the ability to create something,\u201d Gregory said in a recent interview. Mr. Rinaldini agreed to mentor them and eventually invested in their first apartment building.The progress is striking for two young men who struggled to pay their own rent five years ago. Their story offers an unusual glimpse into the rough-and-tumble real estate world in Manhattan.But the question now is: Will their approach work in the long run? The urban landscape \u2014 especially in Manhattan \u2014 is littered with the business corpses of starry-eyed real estate entrepreneurs who forged start-ups that grew too much too fast and later crashed when interest rates changed or the big New York real estate families edged them out.\u201cNew York has a lot of old-line families that control a lot of inventory,\u201d said Jordan Roeschlaub, a senior managing director at Newmark Grubb Knight Frank Capital Markets, a real estate advisory firm. They include the Rudins, the Dursts, the LeFraks, the Zeckendorfs and the Brodskys, all of whom have ample power, money and influence to wield against would-be competitors.\u201cObviously, there are high barriers to entry coming into New York, but we\u2019re young guys. We\u2019re aggressive; we have a lot of energy,\u201d Graham Jones said in an interview.The Jones brothers chose small, rundown buildings, unlikely to be of interest to big companies. And said they picked a specific niche. Their properties were aimed at attracting students and young professionals, since many of the units have small bedrooms best suited for people willing to share their space with others.But their journey has been rocky, strewn with bidding wars, lengthy bureaucratic waits for building permits and angry tenant protests. And with the Federal Reserve poised to start raising interest rates, their toughest hurdles may be yet to come.Gregory graduated from Columbia University with a bachelor\u2019s degree in history in 2005, and landed a job in the mergers and acquisitions department of a banking firm. While working, he took night classes, finishing his master\u2019s in business administration at Fordham University in 2010.When Gregory finished school, the brothers formed their company.They spent a year studying the New York apartment market, posing as potential tenants to look at competitors\u2019 units, scouring permits for names of contractors and architects, hobnobbing with industry veterans and investors at conferences, cold-calling owners asking them to sell, and quizzing anyone and everyone they could for information. Graham Jones met Mr. Rinaldini, who became a major investor, at the upscale, all-male Racquet and Tennis Club on Park Avenue. They also started a brokerage firm, Dallien Realty, to keep on top of market rents and trends.But all the research couldn\u2019t fully prepare them for the gritty, often ruthless, world of New York real estate.When they did find a deal, no one would accept their offer because no one knew who they were. And preparing bids cost money. \u201cWe had thousands of dollars in legal costs that frankly we couldn\u2019t afford at the time,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cThat happened to us three times.\u201dWhen an offer was finally accepted for a small building at 227 East 89th Street, the brothers made a deposit of a \u201ccouple hundred thousand dollars,\u201d which they described as money they had saved, and had 90 nerve-racking days to raise the rest of the $3.5 million purchase price. If they failed, they would lose their deposit. They eventually got investors on board, with Mr. Rinaldini providing the biggest share, and they closed on the property in November 2011. (By April 2013, they had renovated it, raised rents and added so much value that when they refinanced, they were able to return all of the investors\u2019 equity. The building has recently been put up for sale.)Building permits were another hurdle \u2014 taking months, rather than the hoped-for days, to secure.And they faced angry tenant protests at some locations. Many of Manhattan\u2019s apartment buildings contain rent-stabilized and rent-controlled units, which limit the annual rent increases a landlord can impose. For the Jones brothers to refurbish apartments and significantly raise rents as part of their business plan, they needed to boot out or buy out tenants in some of the rent-stabilized units. In some cases, they said, they were just weeding out people who were occupying rent-stabilized units illegally.Tenants at their 50-58 East Third Street property in the East Village were particularly aggressive. They organized demonstrations, posted angry comments on blogs and hired lawyers to fight the evictions.Margaret Sandercock, a lawyer who has represented tenants at three of the brothers\u2019 properties, said one tenant, a retired man in his 70s, had lived in an apartment at 41 West 24th Street for more than 20 years when the Jones brothers bought the building. He didn\u2019t want to take a buyout, she said, but ultimately agreed because he was bothered by the noisy construction and disruption and what she described as frequent phone calls from the landlords.The brothers defended their approach. \u201cWe\u2019ve never kicked any elderly people out,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cWe don\u2019t do anything illegal. We don\u2019t do anything that\u2019s not within our rights.\u201d Litigation continues at several of their New York properties.Michael Kozek, a partner at Ween & Kozek, who has represented tenants at the brothers\u2019 property at 57 Jay Street in Brooklyn, said tenants often leave if they think they will end up in legal fights, simply because they cannot afford to go to court.Fights over regulated units are not new in New York. Even the real estate giant Tishman Speyer Properties ran into highly publicized tenant battles after it acquired the historic Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village residential complex for $5.4 billion in 2006. (It later defaulted on the mortgage and handed the property back to creditors in 2010.)Mr. Rinaldini defended the brothers, saying they had never crossed any legal line with the tenants. His last investment with the company was in the Third Street property.As the economy has rebounded, so have prices and competition, making it harder to find deals. \u201cThe market is horribly overpriced,\u201d Gregory said. As a result, the brothers began looking outside New York, buying two properties in Pennsylvania and one in New Jersey.They say they have confidence in the future of their business, regardless of what the Federal Reserve does or how tough the market becomes.\u201cYou just have to stay disciplined,\u201d Gregory said.Advertisement"}

Growth in China has slowed markedly.Volkswagen said that net profit for the group rose to 2.9 billion euros, or about $3.2 billion, in the first three months of 2015, from \u20ac2.5 billion a year earlier. Sales rose 10 percent to \u20ac52.7 billion.Operating profit improved at the division that produces Volkswagen-brand cars, rising 17 percent to \u20ac514 million, from \u20ac440 million a year earlier. The unit benefited from cost-cutting as well as growth in European markets like Spain that are recovering from a deep economic crisis.Despite the improved earnings, Volkswagen-brand cars made an operating profit equal to 2 percent of sales in the quarter, up from 1.8 percent a year earlier, the company said.Together, Audi and Porsche vehicles accounted for four times as much profit as the Volkswagen-brand unit even though they produce less than one-third as many cars.\u201cWe have always emphasized that 2015 will be a challenging year for the automotive industry as a whole, and also for us,\u201d Martin Winterkorn, the Volkswagen chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cNevertheless, our key figures for the first quarter show that the Volkswagen Group remains on course, despite the headwinds.\u201dBut Mr. Winterkorn refused to leave voluntarily. And he won the support of labor representatives, who under German law have half of the seats on the supervisory board, as well as the state of Lower Saxony, which owns 20 percent of Volkswagen\u2019s voting shares.The Porsche family, descendants of Ferdinand Porsche, designer of the car that later became known as the Beetle, also sided with Mr. Winterkorn. The Porsche family owns a majority of the voting shares. Mr. Pi\u00ebch is a grandson of Mr. Porsche, but he has long had tense relations with his cousins.Volkswagen benefited from the recovery of the European automobile market from lows, the figures released on Wednesday showed. The company\u2019s unit sales in Western Europe rose 6.5 percent to 780,000 cars, including a 25 percent increase in Spain, which has been one of the countries hardest hit by the eurozone economic crisis.In the United States, though, sales slipped 1.4 percent to about 132,000 cars during the quarter, including Audi and Porsche. Volkswagen-brand cars have only 2 percent of the market so far this year, according to Kelley Blue Book, down from 3 percent in 2012.\u201cVW is struggling because they don\u2019t have the S.U.V. products they need right now,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cThat\u2019s the hot segment right now.\u201dMr. Brauer said that VW sales in the United States could improve as the company rolled out the latest version of its Golf, which has received favorable reviews. Worldwide, profit on Volkswagen cars could begin to improve, Mr. Brauer said, as the company intensifies efforts to share components among many different vehicles, a strategy that reduces costs.Sales in China, Volkswagen\u2019s largest market, rose 1.9 percent to 897,000 vehicles. Cooling growth in the country is another worry for Volkswagen, analysts say.Volkswagen also produces Skoda and Seat economy cars, Lamborghini and Bugatti sports cars, and Bentley luxury cars. Sales of all those car brands rose in the quarter except Bentley, which sold 2,232 vehicles, compared with 2,579 a year earlier.Sales of Scania and MAN trucks also declined in the quarter because of problems in Brazil and Russia, Volkswagen said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Taking Feminist Battle to China\u2019s Streets, and Landing in Jail", "Date": "2015-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo publicize domestic violence, two prominent activists, Li Tingting and Wei Tingting, put on white wedding gowns, splashed them with red paint and marched through one of the capital\u2019s most popular tourist districts chanting, \u201cYes to love, no to violence.\u201dMedia-savvy, fearless and well-connected to feminists outside China, the young activists over the last three years have taken their righteous indignation to the streets, pioneering a brand of guerrilla theater familiar in the West but largely unheard-of in this authoritarian nation.Now five of them \u2014 core members of China\u2019s new feminist movement \u2014 sit in jail, accused of provoking social instability. One of the women, Wu Rongrong, 30, an AIDS activist, is said to be ailing after the police withheld the medication she takes for hepatitis. Another, Wang Man, 33, a gender researcher, was said to have had a mild heart attack while in custody.Lawyers for the detainees, who include Zheng Churan, 25, affectionately known as Big Rabbit, say the women have been subjected to near-constant interrogation.The detentions took place early last month on the eve of International Women\u2019s Day as the women planned a public awareness campaign about sexual harassment on public transportation.Now, as security agents from Beijing fan out across the country hunting down the volunteers who took part in the women\u2019s theatrical protests, many young feminists have gone into hiding. \u201cWe\u2019re so afraid and confused,\u201d said one of them, Xiao Meili, 26, who recently completed a 1,200-mile trek across China to draw attention to sexual violence. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand what we did wrong to warrant such a ferocious backlash.\u201dOutside China, campaigners have used Facebook and Twitter to publicize the detainees\u2019 plight, and Western governments have been issuing statements to protest their incarceration.Overnight beginning on April 13, the police in China released five women\u2019s rights activists who had been detained in March as they planned a public awareness campaign against sexual harassment on public transportation. Their detention set off an international campaign for their release.\u201cIf China is committed to advancing the rights of women, then it should be working to address the issues raised by these women\u2019s rights activists \u2014 not silencing them,\u201d said Samantha Power, the American ambassador to the United Nations.As international attention to the women\u2019s case mounts, some rights advocates see echoes of the public relations maelstrom surrounding the female Russian dissident group, Pussy Riot, whose members were arrested in 2012 for their protests against President Vladimir V. Putin.Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch, said the five jailed feminists have drawn far more international attention than the scores of Chinese activists who have been detained during the previous two years of an intensified government drive against political dissent.\u201cMany people find it mind-boggling that the government of the second-largest economy and the world\u2019s largest standing army is afraid of a group of women trying to draw attention to sexual harassment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe combination of power and paranoia on display is very telling.\u201dAnalysts say the effort to quash China\u2019s nascent feminist movement represents a dismal milestone in the Communist Party\u2019s war on grass-roots activism, a campaign that has gained momentum since President Xi Jinping came to power in November 2012. Unlike the government critics and political reform advocates jailed in earlier sweeps, the five detained women confined their activities to matters like domestic violence and discrimination against people with H.I.V. \u2014 issues that the government claims to have also embraced.But rights advocates say security officials were evidently alarmed by the women\u2019s skillful use of social media to organize volunteers, their links to foreign organizations, and the inventive protests and flash mobs that often drew favorable coverage in the Chinese media.\u201cThey have been very successful in using performance to provoke social dialogue on gender issues,\u201d said Zeng Jinyan, a blogger who studies Chinese feminist activism. \u201cI think we can call them the first modern, independent, feminist, grass-roots actors in Chinese history.\u201dSoon after coming to power in 1949, Mao Zedong outlawed forced marriages, prostitution and foot binding, and he introduced a groundbreaking marriage law that gave women the right to file for divorce. Women were considered equal to men, but only as a collective force for economic production, Ms. Zeng said. But in recent decades, as market economics took hold in China, unapologetic male chauvinism re-emerged, and with it, traditional notions of a woman\u2019s role in the family. Women\u2019s incomes have been falling compared with those of their male counterparts in recent years; just over 2 percent of Chinese women hold managerial positions; and all but two of the 25 Politburo members are men.Many of the young activists, born in the 1980s and the coddled and well-educated offspring of China\u2019s one-child policy, discovered in college that the Communist Party dictums on gender equality had become little more than window dressing.Raised in China\u2019s rural south, Wei Tingting, 26, is typical of the new brand of socially conscious women who have challenged the status quo. Soon after gaining a spot at the prestigious Wuhan University, Ms. Wei was drawn to feminist provocateurs in the West; during her sophomore year, she staged a production of \u201cThe Vagina Monologues,\u201d drawing the ire of some male students, according to friends.In early March, Ms. Wei and the other detained women were preparing to stand outside subway stations and distribute stickers and leaflets to highlight the scourge of men who grope women on crowded trains and buses. But beginning on March 6, the police moved in, detaining nearly a dozen people in several cities. After a few days, all but Ms. Wei and the four others were released.Lawyers for the women say the police have repeatedly flouted Chinese law. In addition to denying the women medication, the authorities failed to notify their families about the detentions, and in one instance, the police sat in on a meeting between Ms. Wei and her lawyer, Wang Qiushi.\u201cThe interrogations have been exhausting,\u201d Mr. Wang said by phone. \u201cThe police keep asking her the same questions over and over again and are pressuring her to sign a confession, which she refuses to do because she has not broken any law.\u201dThe charge of \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking troubles\u201d carries a maximum five-year sentence in China, although it can be extended to 10 years if a defendant is convicted of organizing multiple public disturbances.Officials at the Haidian District detention center where most of the women are being held declined to comment.In the meantime, friends, relatives and fellow feminists are reeling. If the women are not released this week, it is likely they will be tried and convicted.Mr. Fan, Ms. Wei\u2019s roommate, said none of the women ever imagined they could be jailed for their work. He said that Ms. Wei had been doing laundry on the day she was summoned by the police and had left a load of clothing in the washing machine. \u201cClearly she thought she would be returning home in a few hours,\u201d he said.Mia Li and Patrick Zuo contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Balance of Power", "Date": "2015-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 For the better part of the last century, crude oil prices have swung like a pendulum, pushing and pulling the fortunes of nations. More often than not, global supplies of the volatile commodity were controlled by the rulers of desert domains who would otherwise have been powerless had it not been for the oil that bubbled beneath their thrones.That pendulum is on the move again, sending the price of oil cascading to less than $45 this winter from more than $100 a barrel last June, and it may fall further in the months ahead. On the surface, this latest oil boom gone bust may feel like history repeating itself, but there is a vital difference this time: The center of the oil world has spun from the sands of Saudi Arabia to the shale oil fields of Texas and North Dakota, a giant new oil patch some wildcatters have begun to call \u201cCowboyistan.\u201dPut another way, the United States is overtaking the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as the vital global swing producer that determines prices. That remarkable change has been building since 2008, as American shale fields accounted for roughly half of the world\u2019s oil production growth while American petroleum output nearly doubled. And shale production methods have proven highly adaptable to market conditions.Not coincidentally, nearly all the advantages of the price swing are moving in Washington\u2019s direction. Most American consumers and industries have benefited from a sharp drop in gasoline prices and other energy costs. And abroad, the economies of oil-producing adversaries like Russia and Venezuela are reeling.Rene G. Ortiz, a former Ecuadorean oil minister who also once served as OPEC\u2019s secretary general, noted that as recently as late 2008 and 2009, the last time oil prices slumped, OPEC cut oil production by four million barrels a day to support prices, and the move stabilized the market in a relatively short time.\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Saudi Arabia think that couldn\u2019t work again today?\u201d Mr. Ortiz asked. \u201cBecause of the soaring U.S. production. Today\u2019s OPEC is thinking about market fundamentals rather than manipulating the market because it doesn\u2019t have the same power it once had.\u201dLast Nov. 27 was a turning point for OPEC at its meeting in Vienna. It was a turbulent session, though behind closed doors, where the firebrand oil ministers of Venezuela and Iran faced off with the dour Saudis and their Persian Gulf allies. The Venezuelans and Iranians, backed by Algeria, Nigeria and a few other countries that need every cent they can get from their oil exports, argued that OPEC should slash production to strengthen prices exactly as the cartel did when the crude price tumbled during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, and again after the tech bubble popped in the early 2000s, and finally as it did again just six years ago.But the Saudis and their Gulf allies said no. They argued that if they cut production, they would merely lose market share to the surging American producers who were increasing daily production by a million barrels year in and year out with no end in sight. The decision effectively forfeited the cartel\u2019s traditional role as the global oil swing producer \u2014 the one and only supplier with the volume of production to raise and lower prices by managing the cartel\u2019s output.The decision came as a shock to the oil market. From the moment OPEC decided to keep its production constant at 30 million barrels a day, a fairly gradual price retreat that began in July morphed into a nose dive as commodity traders dumped their oil positions. Many independent American producers saw the move as a direct attack on them, but it was really a throwing in the towel to the new reality of growing American oil output.The demise of OPEC as the price manipulator is what virtually every American president since Richard Nixon had in mind when they promised to find a way to make the United States energy independent, not chained to Middle East or OPEC oil, after the oil embargoes of the 1960s and 1970s.Hydraulic fracturing, the blasting of oil and gas out of shale rock with water and chemicals, is the single most important factor of change in global markets in more than a decade, with an environmental outcry commensurate to its magnitude.As soon as railroads connected North Dakota\u2019s Bakken shale field to East Coast refineries the last couple of years, imports from the Middle East and Africa dried up, forcing various OPEC producers to redirect their product to China and other Asian markets. There, they battled it out for market share by slashing prices. That is just one example of how shale drilling not only transformed the United States from dependent consumer to a robust producer, but is also transforming the price dynamics of the global market.Shale fields differ in several ways from conventional fields. Shale is not hard to find, but drilling is expensive because wells decline precipitously \u2014 by 60 to 70 percent in their first year. That means companies are obliged to drill well after well to keep production and revenue up.That is not always good for individual producers, especially small ones, when prices fall. But those characteristics give shale producers collectively more power to influence the market because it condenses the amount of time companies have to respond to the inevitable cycles of boom and bust. Oil producers operating in the United States have the ability to rapidly accelerate or tap the brakes \u2014 much as Saudi Arabia and its OPEC partners have turned on and off their spare capacity in the past \u2014 depending on market conditions.Jack Gerard, chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, noted that the United States, which produces roughly the same amount of oil as Saudi Arabia and is poised to surpass the kingdom, is positioned to become the new OPEC but without the overt manipulation.\u201cThe only difference is our position as swing producer will be managed by the free market,\u201d he said, noting that a few all-powerful sheikhs are being replaced by hundreds of executives serving competing companies deciding when, where and how to drill in the new shale fields.\u201cWith the technological advantages we have, we have the ability to adjust to the market,\u201d Mr. Gerard added.The Saudis, in comparison, are in an increasingly weaker position. Last year, their exports declined not only to the United States, but to Asia as well. Still, as one of the lowest-price producers with an expanding refinery capacity, it remains an important player on the world stage.With Saudi Arabia leading, OPEC still controls roughly 30 percent of world oil production, but that is down from more than 40 percent in the 1970s. A reversal of that trend is not likely. (United States production now represents roughly 10 percent of global production.)Jason Bordoff, a former energy adviser to President Obama and now the director of Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, noted that Saudi Arabia\u2019s 2.5 million barrels of spare production capacity (over and above its roughly 10 million barrels a day of production) would continue to give it major influence on world markets, especially when prices are rocketing up as demand outstrips supply. It can still pump more to ease prices when it wants. But now with a global glut and prices cratering, he said, the United States was in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201cThe nature of U.S. shale production, which turns on and off so quickly and has the potential to provide a floor for the world oil price, can have pretty fundamental historic implications for how we think of the role of OPEC and Saudi Arabia versus the role of the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Bordoff said.Since the drop in crude prices began last year, the American oil industry has responded with remarkable speed, dropping more than half its oil rigs, from just over 1,600 late last year to fewer than 800 by April.The transformation has not been without its share of pain. Oil companies have announced layoffs of more than 100,000 workers since November. But as large companies take advantage of bargain basement prices to gobble up the assets of weaker companies, the industry is likely to be better capitalized to expand production in the future.The oil price has edged up in April but a full rebound could take years. In the short term, the West Texas Intermediate oil price benchmark may fall again as American storage facilities reach their space limit this spring. But the decelerating rate of American production growth is bolstering the hopes of commodity traders that the glut will dissipate faster than some extended price collapses of the past.\u201cThe shale industry is now revealing itself as a nimble and price-responsive producer at a time when OPEC member-states have refused to squelch their own production, thereby rejecting their customary market-balancing role,\u201d according to a recent study by Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy. The Energy Department has predicted that current United States oil production of 9.4 million barrels a day will decline by 210,000 barrels a day in the third quarter. Energy experts expect further declines into 2016 (accompanied by reduced production in some conventional foreign oil fields), and many executives are predicting that prices will stabilize at $70 to $80 a barrel over the next few years, a sweet spot where consumers get a break but companies can still profit because technology is making drilling cheaper.The nation\u2019s new ability to influence supplies and prices could only have been a dream in the Nixon and Carter days. Ample United States supplies in recent years protected the American economy while the Middle East and North Africa have been in turmoil, and it enabled Washington to spearhead sanctions on Iran without causing a price increase.But just as the end of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War did not usher in an era of peace and harmony, the new American energy security has not brought with it perfect stability. Analysts who suggested that energy independence would end the need for United States intervention in the Middle East did not see the coming of Islamist terrorism nor the spreading turmoil that has moved from Syria to Iraq and potentially beyond.Foreign foes like Venezuela and Russia have been weakened by the falling price of oil, which dominate their economies. Iran may be willing to negotiate a deal to curtail its nuclear program to escape sanctions. But there is no sign that the Kremlin is less aggressive or dangerous. Falling oil prices should help the global economy, but deflation could be a risk in some nations. Environmentalists argue that the worst thing about low prices for oil and other hydrocarbons is that they encourage more consumption. Lower gasoline prices have pushed up sales of sport utility vehicles and other large cars. Lower oil and natural gas prices are directly tied to the expanded production made possible by hydraulic fracturing, which is still considered risky by many environmentalists because of the escape of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere during exploration, production and transport, along with potential seepage of toxic fluids into water supplies.\u201cHaving prices that reflect the environmental damage are better than low prices that don\u2019t reflect that damage,\u201d said Sonia Aggarwal, director of strategy at Energy Innovation, an environmental consulting firm in San Francisco. But, she added, \u201cthe advancement of technologies and the efficiency standards that the Obama administration has put in place for cars and trucks should make the lower oil prices less damaging than they would have been 10 years ago.\u201dPresident Obama has applauded the drop in gasoline prices, but he still straddles the interests of environmentalists with those of the oil companies when it comes to hot-button issues like offshore drilling and expanding exports of United States oil and natural gas. Nevertheless, he can be expected to use lower energy prices and the abundant domestic oil supplies as a reason for finally rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline intended to bring Canadian oil sands production to American refineries.There is a strong chance, energy experts say, that this could be the beginning of decades of United States dominance in the oil markets, and that dominance will be accompanied by relatively inexpensive energy. The shale fields around the country are plentiful, and there is much more to be drilled. Lower prices have already driven down drilling and other service company costs by more than 15 percent.But more important, the drilling and fracking technology that has made the shale revolution possible is rapidly improving, bringing production costs even lower and raising the yield of each well. For instance, more powerful computers are improving multidimensional geological modeling for well planning. And production output is improving through experimentation in the mixing and use of proppants like sand and ceramics to keep fractures in shale open to release more oil.A recent Citi Research report noted that even when the rig count for natural gas collapsed in 2008 and 2009, production increased anyway, because companies cut costs while bolstering their yields.Even if oil doesn\u2019t exactly follow gas, United States oil production may still increase in coming years even as prices stay well below the $100 a barrel level of recent years. That could marginalize OPEC, and potentially make the United States a major oil exporter for the first time in more than half a century if Washington finally overturns some decades-old regulatory hurdles. Those memories of long car lines at the pump in the 1970s are becoming fainter. They may soon be forgotten.\u201cThe Saudis are facing very challenging conditions as they face the future of the global oil market in part because shale does work at far lower prices than many people thought,\u201d Mr. Bordoff said, \u201cand U.S. shale production is going to keep growing as prices rebound.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Case Against Google May Be Undercut by Rapid Changes in Technology", "Date": "2015-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtBut Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, may not find the comparison entirely flattering. With more than a decade of hindsight, the theories supporting the case against Microsoft have all but fallen apart, and the pursuit of the company that makes Windows may suggest a reason for skepticism about this fight against Google: The tech marketplace is fluid and unpredictable. The giants that look most unbeatable today could falter in ways that may once have seemed unthinkable \u2014 and without a lot of help from the government.The same, he said, could turn out to be true of Google. The rise of mobile devices and the prevalence of apps could make the traditional search engine less central. And if the regulators emerge victorious, they could end up constraining Google in a way that makes its services less useful to consumers \u2014 which would be a hollow victory indeed. The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.These actions are not necessarily as terrible as they seem. In 1999, Microsoft argued that bundling its web browser with its operating system was good for consumers who needed a way to easily get on the Internet. In retrospect, that looks defensible \u2014 today, every computer, tablet and smartphone ship with built-in browsers, because everyone believes they are an important aspect of the user experience of computers.Google argues, similarly, that giving people answers to shopping and travel queries on its main search results page is much more helpful than giving them a bunch of links to competing search services.Some observers agree. \u201cThe analogy I like to use is, complaining that Google is lifting its own vertical search engine over other vertical search engines would be like complaining that The New York Times is not carrying The Los Angeles Times\u2019s sports section,\u201d said Danny Sullivan, founder of Search Engine Land, an online publication that tracks the search industry. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect The New York Times to carry a rival sports section. But you do expect it to have a sports section. When people go to a search engine, they\u2019re looking to search across everything.\u201dAs powerful as Microsoft looked at the time, officials missed ways in which it was vulnerable. For starters, they didn\u2019t anticipate the rise of mobile devices. The 1999 ruling against Microsoft found there were \u201cno products, nor are there likely to be any in the near future\u201d that people around the world could use as \u201csubstitutes\u201d for Windows computers. In fact, within a few years, unexpected rivals began making such substitutes. In 2007, Apple released the iPhone, and soon after, Google released the Android operating system, which Samsung, HTC, Motorola and other manufacturers used to take the smartphone global and mainstream.But even if one believes that regulatory oversight weakened Microsoft, Mr. Manne, of the International Center for Law and Economics, points out that the prosecution could be the reason we\u2019re here today \u2014 with Google as the monopoly power in search. \u201cIt\u2019s the paradigmatic cautionary tale,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had the rise of Google coming on the heels of the antitrust enforcement against Microsoft, and because of all this scrutiny, Microsoft was not as effective a competitor against Google as it could have been.\u201dNoting the potential for another giant, possibly Amazon, to gain a monopoly as a result of the charges against Google, Mr. Manne adds: \u201cI think we would see that potential again here, and that\u2019s exactly what we don\u2019t want.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Market Rally Without Steam", "Date": "2015-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks and bonds ended the first three months of 2015 little changed, leveling off from the steep rise of recent years and raising questions about the road ahead. The stall coincided with signs of flagging momentum in economic growth and corporate earnings and an assortment of foreign developments that threatened to derail the markets.One asset rose substantially, reaching a 12-year high. That was the dollar, which rose 9 percent against a standard basket of currencies of American trading partners. Its ascent was partly driven by a standoff between financially feeble Greece and its European creditors that could force Greece out of the euro. The dollar was also propelled by an event that for years has seemed a few months away: an increase in the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve\u2019s main short-term interest rate. As expected, the Fed last month dropped its pledge to be patient about raising the rate, wording it had used consistently in its policy statements. But the rest of the March statement made clear that the central bank was in no hurry to raise the near-zero percent rate until the economy perks up.The apparent belief among investors that the Fed was still on their side and that economic indicators were not working against them was enough to send the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index up, but barely: It rose less than 0.5 percent in the first quarter, to 2,067.89. Bond prices rose too, reducing the yield on the 10-year Treasury to 1.93 percent from 2.17 percent. Yields on high- and low-quality corporate instruments also fell, although less so. Tacit assurances that no rate increase was imminent have long supported stocks and bonds, but concern is growing that the Fed may have painted itself into a corner. A rate increase could provoke turbulence in the markets, investment advisers warn, but continuing to delay could raise concern about the fragility of the markets, the economic recovery or both. Investors who have cheered the Fed\u2019s dovishness could be the ones whose patience is tested.\u201cThe market believes the Fed doesn\u2019t have the capacity to raise rates, and that\u2019s not a healthy thing,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief United States market strategist at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be at zero, but they don\u2019t want to remove accommodation in a way that\u2019s disruptive.\u201dBut given the Fed\u2019s desire to normalize policy, investors would be better off pondering \u201cwhat the Fed\u2019s pace will be and how far they go,\u201d rather than obsessing over when rates will start rising, Mr. Golub said. He predicted that \u201cwhatever they do, they\u2019re going to do it really, really slowly,\u201d bringing Fed funds to about 1.75 percent by the end of 2017.How successful the Fed has been in dragging the economy out of recession and financial turmoil is debatable. Joblessness has continued to trend lower, at least until a report released early this month showed much fewer net jobs created in March than expected, but wage growth has been sluggish and indicators of the housing market and consumer spending have been weak.Each of the last three Census Bureau monthly reports on retail sales has shown a decline. The pace of home sales reported by the National Association of Realtors for January and February was lower than for any month since last April, as was the average price of previously owned single-family homes.Corporate profits have hit a rough patch, too. Earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 are estimated by FactSet Research Systems to be 4.7 percent lower in the first quarter than the period last year. For all of 2015, FactSet forecasts a 2.3 percent increase, less than half the 4.9 percent gain last year.Fund returns in the first quarter were mediocre, in line with economic and corporate performance. The average domestic stock fund in Morningstar\u2019s database rose 2.6 percent, led by portfolios that focus on health care and consumer discretionary items, the sector that includes retailers, carmakers and travel companies. Funds that hold energy stocks were conspicuously weak, losing 2 percent, as the prices of oil and natural gas continued the plunges that began last June. Browse quarterly returns for variable annuities with at least $6 billion in assets.Energy companies account for much of the decline in earnings estimates. Leaving that sector out, Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citi Research, found economic and corporate conditions satisfactory. Credit is still expanding, he said, manufacturing capacity is tight, and capital spending, excluding energy industries, is expected to rise 5 percent this year.WHETHER the economy is doing well, poorly or so-so, there is a consensus that the United States is faring better than most of the rest of the world. Even so, foreign stock markets and funds that invest in them outperformed. The average international stock fund returned 3.4 percent, with funds that focus on Japan doing exceptionally well, up 12 percent. European funds rose 4.9 percent, while Latin American funds dropped 8.9 percent. Funds that focus on India were notably strong performers, rising 8.4 percent. With many emerging markets facing difficulties, including high debt, weak currencies and slow global growth, India is \u201cone shiny standout,\u201d said Elizabeth R. Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants. She credits success there, which she predicts will continue, to a package of business-friendly changes made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At the other end of the spectrum is Brazil. Ms. Morrissey described its fortunes as \u201cway scarier than others\u201d because of the strong dollar, collapsing commodity prices, high inflation and a corruption scandal at Petrobras, the national oil company.\u201cThe government has been in office three months, and people are already taking to the streets,\u201d she said.The rising dollar has had a more benign effect elsewhere. Investment advisers attribute much of the strength in foreign stocks and the dollar to a single catalyst: diverging monetary policies. The Fed may be taking its time to turn hawkish, but few foreign central banks are even contemplating it and several are going in the opposite direction.The European Central Bank started a program of bond purchases in the first quarter, the Bank of Japan continues to buy bonds, and the People\u2019s Bank of China is expected to do the same soon.These moves have helped make many foreign stocks more appealing. The most recent edition of Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s survey of global fund managers, released in mid-March, found managers with the greatest underweight position in American stocks, versus the rest of the world, since early 2008.A Fed that is more hawkish than other central banks bolsters the dollar by keeping yields comparatively high on American bonds, enticing foreigners to buy them and, therefore, the dollar. But yields just about everywhere are historically low, perhaps perilously so, and prices are very high, said Joel Beam, manager of the Forward Select Opportunity fund. \u201cI\u2019m extremely carefully positioned and selling into strength anything that seems overpriced,\u201d he said.Bond investors escaped the first quarter mostly unscathed. The average fund was up 1.3 percent, with portfolios that specialize in long-term issues rising 3.2 percent. Two categories of funds that hold foreign bonds \u2014 world bond and emerging-market bond \u2014 were barely changed. Mr. Beam prefers stocks, with reservations. \u201cThe stock landscape is pretty expensive, but people have to be thinking about having more equities in their life for the next five years,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than buy fixed income and get slaughtered, buy a good bank.\u201dAs for where to seek such a bank or other stock, he suggests Europe, which he considers to be in the early stages of a \u201crobust healing process.\u201dIf Europe is on the mend, investment advisers credit the European Central Bank. Ms. Morrissey believes that the bond purchase program, or quantitative easing, has immunized other weak eurozone economies from danger should Greece leave the currency bloc.\u201cMr. Draghi saved the day,\u201d she said, referring to Mario Draghi, the head of the bank. \u201cI would expect\u201d the prospect of a Greek exit \u201cto have an impact on Italy, but with Q.E. it hasn\u2019t. The rest of the union will probably hold together.\u201dAs for Greece itself, Ms. Morrissey rates the odds slightly better than even that it will remain in the euro. It is uncertain whether \u201cthey have the cash to survive,\u201d she acknowledged, \u201cbut it seems the new Greek government really understands the severity of their situation.\u201dEffusive praise for European policy makers is one reason Mr. Levkovich, the Citi Research equity strategist, prefers American stocks.\u201cEveryone loves Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat tells me they\u2019ve bought it already.\u201dJudging by the tripling of the S.&P. 500 in six years, a lot of investors have bought American stocks, too. He predicted further gains, but only about 7 percent this year. He recommended niches like retailing, financial services and parts of technology like infrastructure and security, and he said he would avoid health care and the bond market.Mr. Golub, of RBC Capital Markets, also favored American stocks, and was cautious in his optimism. \u201cThe weight of evidence suggests the next six to 12 months look pretty safe,\u201d he said.He warned that it was hard to know how to invest when investors and the Fed itself would prefer a reversion to normal monetary policy but are afraid of the first rate increase that would signal its arrival.\u201cWe\u2019re in a bizarro land,\u201d Mr. Golub said. \u201cThe way investors are thinking is abnormal, but it\u2019s logical.\u201dAdvertisement"}

By building space centers in Houston; Huntsville, Ala.; rural Mississippi; and Brevard County, Fla., NASA used its prestige and financial might to challenge the profoundly racist culture of its host communities.The agency enforced equal opportunity hiring rules (albeit poorly) for its contractors, forbade employees to participate in events at segregated institutions and brought significant numbers of educated workers to the Deep South. The black engineers, scientists, computer programmers, would-be astronauts and other pioneers who desegregated the space program were as courageous as any civil rights marchers, and this is the first time their story has been told in detail.Under pressure from Johnson, NASA officials seemed to relish pushing for civil rights.

In 2013, a New York Times obituary mentioned the rocket scientist Yvonne Brill\u2019s stroganoff recipe and the number of her children before getting around to her professional achievements. Outraged, Swaby became inspired to write this valuable collection of brisk biographical sketches of 52 women who made contributions in fields like medicine, genetics and physics. These scientists were brilliant, driven, resistant to criticism and, because few would hire or pay them, often forced to work for nothing.The seismologist Inge Lehmann discovered that the earth has an inner core. Jane Wright, an African-American doctor, helped develop chemotherapy. Emmy Noether helped invent abstract algebra and create the equations to support Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin worked out the crystal structure of vitamin B12. When she won science\u2019s highest honor, The Daily Mail announced: \u201cNobel Prize for British Wife.\u201dSome sketches correct earlier portrayals that emphasized their subjects\u2019 ladylike qualities \u2014 for example, Florence Nightingale is presented here not just as a nurturing angel with a lamp, but as a pioneer in statistics.Swaby tells the scientists\u2019 stories with energy and clarity. Refreshingly, spouses and children are mentioned only when relevant \u2014 and the book is recipe-free.ADA\u2019S ALGORITHMHow Lord Byron\u2019s Daughter Ada Lovelace Launched the Digital AgeBy James Essinger254 pp. Melville House, $25.95.In this engrossing biography, Essinger argues that we might have entered the computing age two centuries ago had the contributions of Ada Lovelace been recognized in her time.The daughter of the dissolute Lord Byron and Annabella Milbanke, Lovelace was pushed into mathematics early. Her mother was determined to squelch any Byronic impulses in her only child and to make Lovelace \u201ccompletely rational,\u201d Essinger writes. Lovelace took to her studies easily, although she irritated her mother with her impulse to seek \u201cplayful uses for science and mathematics.\u201dAt the age of 17, she met Charles Babbage, then 44, and thus began one of the great friendships in the history of science. Babbage was an eccentric showman who had invented a machine for making calculations. It was pure steampunk: whirling cogs and gears and cranks. He was envisioning a more elaborate contraption, whose workings would be controlled by a punch-card system. He hadn\u2019t foreseen the implications of his invention \u2014 but Lovelace did. In a visionary analysis, she explained that the engine could be applied to any manipulation of information, defining \u201coperation\u201d as we use the term today, and writing the first computer program.In a letter to Babbage, Lovelace once wrote, \u201cI wish to add my mite towards expounding & interpreting the Almighty, & his laws & works, for the most effective use of mankind.\u201d Essinger\u2019s biography reveals how amply she succeeded.HALF-LIFEThe Divided Life of Bruno Pontecorvo, Physicist or SpyBy Frank Close378 pp. Basic Books, $29.99.The five-year disappearance of the brilliant Italian physicist Bruno Pontecorvo is one of the Cold War\u2019s enduring mysteries, and the subject of this riveting study.Keeping track of Pontecorvo was never easy. Born to a wealthy Jewish family in Pisa, Pontecorvo worked as a researcher with Enrico Fermi, figuring out how to use neutrons to induce radioactivity, before fleeing to Paris to escape \u00adFascism. He then fled from Paris to southern France by bicycle as the Nazis invaded the city, and soon left Europe entirely for a job in Oklahoma. The Manhattan Project recruited him in 1943 despite a note of concern from the F.B.I.: An agent had noticed Communist literature on Pontecorvo\u2019s bookshelves. After the war, Pontecorvo joined the nuclear energy program of Britain, becoming a citizen there \u2014 and then vanished along with his family in 1950, only to reappear in Moscow five years later.There\u2019s still no direct evidence Pontecorvo was a spy, but Close suspects that the double agent Kim Philby had alerted Moscow to the F.B.I.\u2019s interest in him, which prompted the Soviets to hustle the scientist into Russia. In any case, Close comes to the inarguable conclusion that he made the wrong bet in the Cold War: \u201cPontecorvo spent 43 years in Russia, where his scientific career was frustrated, his family was traumatized and his ideals were slowly crushed in the face of Soviet repression. If Pontecorvo was a spy, he was punished more than the \u00adothers.\u201dLaura Helmuth is the science and health editor for Slate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shrugging Off Slow Growth, Fed Predicts a Rebound", "Date": "2015-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Repeating an all-too-familiar pattern, the American economy barely grew during the first three months of the year, but the Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it expected growth to rebound, suggesting that it still intends to start raising its benchmark interest rate this year.Despite the Fed\u2019s optimism, a number of Wall Street forecasters cut their estimates for second-quarter growth as they concluded that the weakness, caused in part by cold weather but also by cautious consumers and the strength of the dollar, could linger.\u201cThe U.S. economy stumbled badly in the first quarter,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. \u201cModest growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 turned into virtually no growth in the first quarter of 2015.\u201dStrong job growth during the first two months of the year was followed by a disappointing increase of 126,000 jobs in March, and the Fed, in a statement after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, said labor market conditions had not improved over the last month. The federal government is scheduled to release an initial estimate of April job growth on May 8.Inflation also remains sluggish. Although concerns about deflation have subsided, price inflation remains well below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as healthy. Wages also continue to rise slowly, notwithstanding a recent spate of headlines as large employers like Walmart have announced modest increases.The Fed\u2019s statement, however, described the latest round of economic setbacks as likely to be temporary. Officials hope that this year will follow the pattern of last year, when strong summer growth offset an even weaker first quarter.The Fed did not directly address when it might start to raise short-term rates, which it has held near zero since December 2008. Officials have said they would begin to consider such an increase at the committee\u2019s next meeting, in June. Analysts generally predict that the Fed will not act before September, and possibly later.The Fed\u2019s statement was approved by a unanimous vote of 10 to 0.Domestic growth is being restrained by the weakness of the rest of the global economy. As the dollar has gained strength, American exporters have struggled. Foreign trade also was curtailed by the lingering effects of a labor dispute that slowed the flow of goods through West Coast ports. Net exports fell 7.2 percent in the first quarter, shaving nearly a full percentage point off the overall growth figure.A sharp reduction in business investment also weighed on first-quarter output, a trend that some experts attributed to big cuts in spending in the energy industry as falling oil prices prompted drillers and oil production companies to pull back. At the same time, businesses piled up inventory, which lifted the reported pace of growth but led some analysts to cut back their expectations for the second quarter.Public sector spending posted a surprising decline. State and local government expenditures fell at the steepest rate since the first quarter of 2012.Consumer spending has been surprisingly weak despite the drop in gasoline prices that began last summer. Such spending, which makes up roughly two-thirds of gross domestic product, rose 1.9 percent, well below the 4.4 percent gain in the fourth quarter of 2014. Mr. Anderson said consumers were most likely using the windfall to pay down credit card debt or add to savings. He said he expected consumers to spend more aggressively later in the year, driving growth.The estimate of economic growth was the first of three that the Commerce Department will release, and the number is often revised sharply. The average revision in the initial estimate is about 1.2 percentage points. The next estimate will come out on May 29.Despite the slow start to the year, many economic forecasters share the Fed\u2019s expectation that the warmer weather will usher in better news.\u201cWe believe weakness was grossly exaggerated, and there will be significant catch-up in Q2, but, of course, that remains to be seen,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. In a separate report later in the morning, the National Association of Realtors said pending home sales rose 1.1 percent in March. Pending sales are now at their highest level since June 2013, according to the Realtors\u2019 index. Some experts say the housing market should remain strong in the next few months, especially since the Fed does not seem to be in a rush to begin increasing its benchmark rate.But Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS Global Banking and Markets, cautioned that some of the headwinds evident last quarter would not abate immediately.The drop in energy-related spending will eventually level out, he said, but it will take some time. And the dollar remains strong compared with currencies like the euro, so no relief for exporters is in sight.\u201cThe dollar has strengthened so much that it could restrain the magnitude of the rebound,\u201d Mr. Berger said.After earlier predictions that the Fed might move as early as June, most economists now say it will wait at least until its September meeting, or even later. The latest data \u201cstrengthens the argument for a delay by the Fed,\u201d Mr. Anderson said.At the same time, however, financial markets may be exaggerating the likely delay. Fed funds futures now imply just a 26 percent probability that the Fed will raise rates by September, and only a 52 percent probability of a first increase this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By contrast, last month 15 of 17 Fed officials predicted that the Fed would begin to raise rates by the end of the year.Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said the Fed was in a wait-and-see mode.\u201cThey are largely discounting the weakness in G.D.P. in Q1, but they will want to see more evidence that the trend remains solid and that the unemployment rate is still declining before starting the normalization process,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not in a rush. We continue to expect tightening to start in September.\u201dMost analysts are focused on the September meeting because it will be followed by a regular quarterly news conference with the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen. The Fed has tended to announce major policy changes at such meetings. But Ms. Yellen insisted at her last such news conference, in March, that the Fed could also act at its July or October meetings, when she is not scheduled to take questions.To underscore that point, the Fed invited reporters to participate in a test of a dial-in news conference system on Wednesday afternoon that would let Ms. Yellen speak with reporters on short notice. The Fed said any such call would also be broadcast. Binyamin Appelbaum reported from Washington and Nelson D. Schwartz from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece Must Walk the Talk, and Soon", "Date": "2015-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyGreece has two weeks to produce some red meat.The prospect of a default is off the table for the time being after Yanis Varoufakis, the country\u2019s finance minister, confirmed that Greece would meet a payment to the International Monetary Fund on Thursday. But, with more payments looming, the fear of bankruptcy will be back by the end of April if Greece doesn\u2019t come up with some serious overhauls by then.Without those, its eurozone creditors will refuse to lend it more money, and Athens will then probably suffer a disorderly default.Athens has scraped together enough cash to meet the I.M.F. payment, in part by extracting liquidity from quasi state entities. However, the left-wing government has pretty much exhausted its techniques for squeezing blood from a stone. Meanwhile, it has largely wasted two and a half months in office by lecturing its creditors, sending out mixed messages about its willingness to default and coming up with amateurish overhaul plans. Now the government needs to get serious and \u2014 unless Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is really willing to default \u2014 impose vicious capital controls and exit the euro.Athens\u2019s eurozone creditors are still hanging tough. Although they do not want Greece to enter a spiral of self-destruction and are worried about the fallout it if does, they do not trust what the government says. As a result, the creditors rightly want to see some meaningful actions before they lend Greece more money. Mr. Tsipras needs to show he means business, by suffering some political cost at home as a result of implementing unpopular measures. Otherwise, there is a risk that the government will take the cash, continue to speak with a forked tongue and still default in June if it can\u2019t get a new long-term deal to its liking.In the next two weeks \u2014 running up to a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on April 24 \u2014 the two sides should focus on three issues.First, pensions. Although Athens has pushed up the retirement age in recent years, the current system is riddled with exemptions that allow many privileged people to receive early pensions. Not only has Mr. Tsipras so far been unwilling to close these loopholes, he wants to restore the so-called 13th pension, a bonus Christmas payment, to over a million pensioners at a cost of 600 million euros, or about $658 million. He also wants to pay \u20ac326 million in supplementary pensions.While there may be a case for increasing pensions for the very poorest people, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s 13th pension would kick in for anybody who receives less than \u20ac700 a month, and supplementary pensions would benefit those who are already getting basic ones. So the government\u2019s plans are more about dishing out goodies to its supporters than meeting genuine need.Second, tax. Athens\u2019s latest 26-page overhaul document, submitted to creditors last week, contains a host of ideas for cracking down on tax evasion. Many are good, including audits on large offshore transfers, to home in on untaxed income; and issuing lottery tickets to customers who demand receipts, as a way of combating avoidance of value-added taxes. Athens also wants to strengthen the independence of its tax authority, with which previous governments have interfered.The snag is that the government expects these and other proposals to produce \u20ac4.7 billion to \u20ac6.1 billion of revenue this year. Maybe in time they will generate significant cash, but neither Athens nor its creditors should count on much in 2015. Since deep reform is more important than fiscal austerity, the government should be told to carry on with these measures but not factor much revenue from them into its fiscal forecasts.Third, banking. Athens rightly says the sector has been marred by clientelism and too close a link with the political system. The snag is that the government has seemingly continued to meddle.Since Mr. Tsipras took office in January, the chairmen of two of the largest banks, the National Bank of Greece and Eurobank, have both been replaced with people who are close to the new government. Meanwhile, the chairman of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, the bank bailout fund through which \u20ac40 billion of creditors\u2019 money has been channeled, has been forced to resign.These are worrying developments, given that there is no official channel through which politicians can bring about management changes in commercial banks and that the fund was supposed to be at arm\u2019s length from the government. Athens\u2019s latest promise to enhance the fund\u2019s independence rings hollow.Meanwhile, the government wants to set up a so-called bad bank to manage some of the industry\u2019s nonperforming loans. While this is an excellent idea in principle \u2014 which could result in the creation of good banks that would start providing credit to the real economy again \u2014 it could lead to yet more clientelism given the sector\u2019s repoliticization.Greece\u2019s creditors should insist on a proper explanation of what happened with the recent management changes and possibly unwind some of them. The creditors should also find more effective ways of depoliticizing the industry before agreeing to finance a bad bank.Athens has decided to avoid a confrontation with its creditors this week. But unless it gets its skates on and uses the two-week window to produce serious overhauls, it will not be able to postpone one for long.Advertisement"}

The relief stations are expected to ease distribution of water, food and medicine, said Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, a spokesman at the Ministry of Home Affairs.Electricity has been intermittent at best in Katmandu, and absent entirely in other parts of Nepal, but that is not wholly unusual in a country where nighttime blackouts are routine.Many hotels, commercial buildings and wealthy homes in the capital have their own generators. But nearly all of the country\u2019s gas and diesel supplies are brought in from India, and with traffic reduced to a crawl along major highways, those supplies could dwindle quickly. Some gas stations in Katmandu have already run dry; others are rationing their remaining supplies.Thousands of Katmandu\u2019s residents squatted on streets throughout the city, either because their homes had been destroyed or because continued aftershocks, including one of magnitude 6.7, left them too afraid to go back inside. Other residents were camping out in schools, school playgrounds and government offices.The government announced that schools would remain closed for at least five days, and it pleaded with government workers to help in local rescue efforts in place of their usual jobs.Stephen Groves, who lives in Katmandu, said he had been inspecting a building for cracks shortly after noon on Sunday when the biggest of many aftershocks hit, leading to terrified screams from those nearby.\u201cThe whole time I was thinking if the building next to me was going to come down on top of me,\u201d Mr. Groves said in an email. \u201cPeople here are in a panic, and every aftershock contributes to that. They are not going indoors, they are staying in the roads and in open areas. Many are searching for family members.\u201dMr. Groves said he had gone to a hospital in the capital on Saturday, where hordes of people were lying on the ground outside the building, many with intravenous drips hooked up to their arms and shocked looks on their faces.Maps show the landscape of temporary shelters, the epicenter of the earthquake and its aftershocks.The city was awash with rumors that the worst aftershocks were yet to come and with fears of greater destruction in the countryside, large swaths of which remained unreachable by phone.Subhash Ghimire, the editor in chief of the Nepalese newspaper Rep\u00fablica, said he managed to reach his father in his village, home to about 3,000 people, near the epicenter in the Gorkha district. \u201cHe said not a single house is left in our village, including our own house,\u201d Mr. Ghimire said.Aftershocks and small avalanches throughout the day Sunday continued to plague the nearly 800 people staying at the mountain base camp and at higher elevation camps.6 PhotosAfter posting on Twitter that he was \u201cfairly safe but stuck\u201d at the base camp, a climber, Jim Davidson, then provided a more alarming update from Camp 1, which is above the base camp.Nick Talbot, 39, was attempting to be the first person with cystic fibrosis to climb Mount Everest when a 100- to 200-yard wall of ice and snow came barreling toward him.\u201cI ran away,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI thought, \u2018There is no chance I can get away.\u2019 I just had my socks on. It knocked me into the rocks. I got up and it knocked me over again.\u201d he said. He was evacuated by helicopter Sunday afternoon. He returned without anything but the clothes he was wearing. All of his belongings were buried by the avalanche.\u201cI\u2019m sure there will have been many fatalities just because the scale of it,\u201d he said.Tulasi Prasad Gautam, director general of Nepal\u2019s Tourism Department, said he feared that continued aftershocks had trapped more climbers. In addition to the dead and injured, nearly 25 climbers who had been en route Saturday to Camp 2 from Camp 1 are missing.\u201cActually, the tents are still there for some 20 to 25 climbers who were heading towards Camp 2 in the course of climbing practice, but they are not in contact,\u201d Mr. Gautam said.\u201cThe tons and tons of falling ice going this vertical distance created a huge aerosol avalanche and accompanying air blast,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is worth noting that over many expeditions we have never seen an avalanche from this area that was even remotely of this scale.\u201dSusan Parker-Burns, a spokeswoman from the United States Embassy in Nepal, said Sunday in an email that a rescue and relief team from the United States Agency for International Development was sent by military transport to Nepal, and that it would arrive on Monday.Also Sunday, the Israeli military said that it was preparing to send two Boeing 747s carrying 260 aid workers and more than 90 tons of cargo to Katmandu. About 600 Israelis are believed to be in Nepal, a popular destination for young backpackers after their compulsory military service. Magen David Adom, Israel\u2019s national emergency medical response organization, had already sent an advance team of 10 paramedics and two doctors to Nepal.Nepal\u2019s people had already become exhausted with the political paralysis, but those feelings could turn explosive if relief and rescue efforts fail in the coming weeks, analysts said. The fear of just such an outcome could spur an intense international relief effort, as an odd collection of countries \u2014 including China, India and the United States \u2014 were already cooperating on pushing Nepal\u2019s politicians toward compromise.Thomas Fuller reported from Katmandu, Nepal, and Gardiner Harris from New Delhi.

{"Headline": "Arkansas Governor\u2019s Son Thrust Into Spotlight Over Religious Exception Bill", "Date": "2015-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas, spoke on Wednesday about the future of what proponents call the religious freedom bill pending in his state, he disclosed that the proposal had drawn resistance from a particularly noteworthy critic: his son, Seth Hutchinson.But to people familiar with the Hutchinsons, long one of the most influential families in Arkansas, the news was hardly a bombshell.\u201cIt would be surprising to me if he didn\u2019t do that,\u201d said Shawn Standefer, a childhood friend of the younger Mr. Hutchinson who captained their national championship-winning Quiz Bowl team in high school. \u201cHe\u2019s always been concerned with justice, however he\u2019s thought of it.\u201dAnd so it was on Saturday, with lawmakers nearing a vote on the legislation that critics said would legalize discrimination against gay people, that the younger Mr. Hutchinson wrote to his father and warned that the proposal could damage Arkansas\u2019s reputation and economy. It was only the latest chapter in a politically complicated relationship between Asa Hutchinson, a former congressman, and Seth Hutchinson, 31, an organizer for the Texas State Employees Union.\u201cI love my dad, and we have a good, close relationship,\u201d Seth Hutchinson said on Wednesday. \u201cBut we disagree a lot on political issues. This is just another one, but a lot of families disagree politically. But we stay close.\u201dMr. Hutchinson has not always been what he described as the family\u2019s political \u201cblack sheep.\u201d\u201cI kind of grew up on the campaign trail,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a political opinion just came naturally to me. At first, I pretty much followed the values that my family and my parents laid out for me.\u201dBut, starting when he was about 15 and working as a dishwasher at a diner, Mr. Hutchinson\u2019s views began to change as he shuffled through other jobs, including stints at Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s and Sears. He grew frustrated when he saw older workers enduring financial hardships in low-paying jobs.The Indiana law has touched off a storm of protests from businesses, local governments and college athletics.\u201cIt just showed me that there\u2019s something wrong,\u201d he said, adding that he became interested in gay rights at about the same time, when friends began discussing their sexual orientations and after the arrest of an art teacher, who was gay.\u201cHe was not out,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said of the teacher. \u201cAnd he was arrested in a park \u2014 I think the official charge was attempting to loiter \u2014 and it was obvious he was there because he couldn\u2019t be out and keep his job.\u201dMr. Hutchinson had robust political discussions with his father even as a high school student, long before their views diverged so vastly.\u201cHe would defend his views,\u201d Mr. Standefer said. \u201cAnd as they changed, he tried to stand by his new views.\u201d Mr. Hutchinson spent a year at Georgetown University before enrolling at the University of Central Arkansas, where he joined groups like the Young Democratic Socialists, and rallied for gay rights during the tenure of another Republican, Gov. Mike Huckabee. He would contact a cousin, Tim C. Hutchinson, who sat in the State House of Representatives, to register his views.Seth Hutchinson later moved to Texas and became a labor activist, which the governor mentions to left-leaning audiences. Father and son communicate regularly, Seth Hutchinson said, and the family gathers at least once or twice a year.\u201cIt\u2019s always a lively and engaging conversation,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said. On Wednesday, the governor said he would ask lawmakers to either recall or rewrite portions of the bill. Seth Hutchinson, though, refused to take credit. \u201cI did not sway my dad,\u201d he said. \u201cI think my dad is rethinking this because of the pressure that\u2019s coming at him from all sides.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "College for the Masses", "Date": "2015-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigher EducationGrowing up in Miami in the 1990s, Carlos Escanilla was a lot more interested in hanging out with friends and playing music than in school. The son of immigrants from Chile, he slogged through high school with a C+ average and scored about 900 out of 1,600 on the SAT. \u201cI was convinced I was going to be a famous rock star,\u201d Mr. Escanilla, now 36, said.When people talk about four-year colleges not being for everyone, the teenage Carlos Escanilla is the sort of student they have in mind. He seemed to be a much better fit for a job, a vocational program or a community college.Yet on a summer night in 1997, a friend persuaded Mr. Escanilla to try to enroll at nearby Florida International University. The college was growing and might be willing to take a chance on a marginal student. And, Mr. Escanilla began to realize, he didn\u2019t have anything better to do.\u201cI didn\u2019t have a band, I didn\u2019t have a way to tour,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any prospects.\u201d Two months later, he was sitting in classes at Florida International.The fate of students like Mr. Escanilla is crucial to today\u2019s debate over who should go to college: How much money should taxpayers spend subsidizing higher education? How willing should students be to take on college debt? How hard should Washington and state governments push colleges to lift their graduation rates? All of these questions depend on whether a large number of at-risk students are really capable of completing a four-year degree.As it happens, two separate \u2014 and ambitious \u2014 recent academic studies have looked at precisely this issue. The economists and education researchers tracked thousands of people over the last two decades in Florida, Georgia and elsewhere who had fallen on either side of hard admissions cutoffs. Less selective colleges often set such benchmarks: Students who score 840 on the SAT, for example, or maintain a C+ average in high school are admitted. Those who don\u2019t clear the bar are generally rejected, and many don\u2019t attend any four-year college.Such stark cutoffs provide researchers with a kind of natural experiment. Students who score an 830 on the SAT are nearly identical to those who score an 840. Yet if one group goes to college and the other doesn\u2019t, researchers can make meaningful estimates of the true effects of college.And the two studies have come to remarkably similar conclusions: Enrolling in a four-year college brings large benefits to marginal students.In many ways, the conclusions should not be surprising. Earlier research, albeit based on weaker data sets, had similar findings. More broadly, a long line of research has found that education usually pays off \u2014 for individuals and societies \u2014 in today\u2019s technologically complex, globalized economy.YET the new findings also challenge a good bit of conventional wisdom about college. There are few surer ways to elicit murmurs of agreement than to claim that \u201ccollege isn\u2019t for everyone.\u201d On both the political left and right, experts have taken to arguing that higher education is overrated (at least when it comes to other people\u2019s children). Some liberals seem worried that focusing on education distracts from other important economic issues, like Wall Street, the top 1 percent and the weakness of labor unions.Many policy makers, for their part, prefer to emphasize an expansion of community college rather than four-year college. President Obama has proposed making community college free for most students, as Tennessee and Chicago have done.Enrolling more students in community colleges may well make economic sense. So, in all likelihood, would creating more and better vocational training, for well-paid jobs like medical technician and electrician, which don\u2019t require a bachelor\u2019s degree. The United States, Mr. Autor says, \u201cmassively underinvests\u201d in such training.Yet the new research is a reminder that the country also underinvests in enrolling students in four-year colleges \u2014 and making sure they graduate. Millions of people with the ability to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree are not doing so, and many would benefit greatly from it.A question that has always hung over these findings is whether college itself deserves any credit for the patterns. You can imagine a scenario in which college graduates would thrive regardless of whether they went to college, because of their own skills and drives. By this same logic, helping more people become college graduates might not necessarily benefit them. But the new findings are the latest, and maybe strongest, reason to believe that college matters. Much as staying in high school is generally a better life strategy than dropping out, continuing on to college seems like the better plan for a great majority of students.The skills and knowledge that they gain from more time in school are certainly part of the explanation. Mr. Escanilla thinks that, at 15, he was not mature enough to take school seriously. A few years later, he understood that dreaming of rock stardom wasn\u2019t a career plan.\u201cI fell in love with learning,\u201d he recalls. With his parents suffering financial problems, he worked almost full time while in college (mostly as a barista at Starbucks, which gave him health insurance and a free pound of coffee every week). Finishing college took him almost six years, but he graduated with a degree in liberal arts studies. He chose it over more utilitarian majors because he enjoyed studying subjects like literature and psychology.After a few years of working as a salesman for Bell South, persuading small businesses to buy high-end telecommunications equipment, he realized he wasn\u2019t thrilled with his work. He had thought about going to graduate school after college but felt intimidated by it, as a first-generation college graduate. By the time he was a married 28-year-old father of two, he was no longer intimidated, and enrolled in a psychology program while working. Today, he is a psychotherapist at a local high school and also counsels adults as a professional coach.\u201cWhat I learned in college was kind of how to have this, \u2018Yes, but how\u2019 attitude,\u201d Mr. Escanilla said. \u201cYou fall, dust yourself off and keep going.\u201d He now assigns his high school students to visit the Florida International campus and soak in the atmosphere. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need to talk to anybody,\u201d he tells them. \u201cJust walk around. There is something about that energy on campus that makes you want to be better.\u201dThe biggest problem with the colleges that marginal students attend, like Florida International and several state colleges in Georgia, is how many students fall down and don\u2019t figure out a way to keep going. Dropout rates typically hover around 50 percent, which leaves students with the grim combination of debt and no degree. Reducing these rates could bring big economic benefits. Until that happens, some people have been left to wonder whether many teenagers should simply give up on the idea of college.The answer to that question, however, seems to be a resounding no. Many community colleges have even higher dropout rates than four-year colleges. And most people with no college education are struggling mightily in the 21st-century economy.\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely destructive to give people the message that we\u2019re overinvesting in college, that we\u2019re in a college-debt bubble, that you\u2019ll end up as an unemployed ethnomusicologist with $200,000 in debt working at Starbucks,\u201d Mr. Autor, the M.I.T. economist, said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a message you would want to give to anyone you know who has kids.\u201dBack then, a high school education was the new ticket to the middle class. Today, a college education is. And when it comes to people\u2019s own children, there is remarkably little disagreement about the value of college, even when it requires taking on debt. Affluent, middle-class and lower-income parents alike, in overwhelming numbers, aspire for their children to finish college.Americans agree that \u201cour kids\u201d should go to college. The debate is really about who qualifies as \u201cour kids.\u201dDavid Leonhardt is the editor of The Upshot, a New York Times politics and policy venture. Advertisement"}

But he came anyway and maybe that was the real point.President Obama ventured into Red America on Thursday and Friday to sell his economic agenda to small but polite audiences, and along the way he tried to demonstrate that both he and his ideas could travel anywhere in the country, even to the parts where he is deeply unpopular.It would be hard for him to find a place where he is less popular than in Utah, the tourist-friendly mecca for skiers, hikers, Mormons and Republicans. The president received just 25 percent of the vote here in 2012, his lowest showing in any state, in a 50-point loss to his opponent, Mitt Romney, who now makes his home in Utah.For obvious reasons, then, Mr. Obama had never made it to Utah since taking office, but when he landed on Thursday night, it became the 49th state he has visited as president. (South Dakota is now the lone standout.) While relegated to campaign in more Democrat-friendly states in the months before the fall midterm elections, Mr. Obama lately has made a point of visiting Republican-leaning states like Alabama, Idaho, Kansas, South Carolina and, in the last two days, Kentucky and Utah.David Simas, the president\u2019s director of political strategy and outreach, said the visits build off key themes in recent speeches: \u201cThat there\u2019s much more that unites us as Americans than divides us.\u201d He added, \u201cWhen you step out of Washington, there\u2019s a bipartisan consensus around so many issues, including clean energy, skills training, community college and other topics.\u201dIndeed, this week Mr. Obama stuck to less polarizing themes like job training. In Louisville on Thursday, he visited a data technology firm called Indatus to highlight his efforts to teach technology skills. Here at this air base north of Salt Lake City on Friday, he announced a new goal of training 75,000 workers for the solar energy industry by 2020, many of them military veterans leaving the armed services.But Mr. Obama also used the occasion to meet with leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the Mormon Church is known, and Utah\u2019s Republican governor, Gary R. Herbert.In Kentucky, home of his primary congressional antagonist, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, Mr. Obama accused the opposition of wanting to cut federal funding for job training. That irritated Mr. McConnell\u2019s team, which responded by saying that Republicans had made no such proposal and that Mr. Obama was simply extrapolating what would have to be cut under broader spending ceilings that he too once agreed to.Either way, Mr. McConnell\u2019s staff said the president\u2019s visit seemed unnecessarily antagonistic rather than bridge-building. \u201cWeird that on the eve of his attempt to sell Congress on his Iran caper that he would be in G.O.P. states attacking Republicans,\u201d said Don Stewart, the senator\u2019s spokesman. \u201cAnd why not visit the states of Democrats who oppose his trade agenda to encourage them? Really odd strategy.\u201dAnd Mr. Obama seemed to be having fun. While he could have scrapped his Louisville stop given the Iran news, he insisted on continuing, and seemed to be in a loose mood once he landed in Kentucky. In his speech, he thanked Mayor Greg Fischer, who he said gave him not only a Louisville Slugger baseball bat, but \u201calso a really big suitcase full of bourbon.\u201d After a pause, Mr. Obama added, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a really big case.\u201dAnd then he told the story of a young man who despite having no college degree learned how to write computer code. \u201cThe reason I remember this guy is because his name is Ben Kuhl\u201d (pronounced cool), which the president declared \u201ca really cool name.\u201d He added, \u201cI mean, I kind of wish my name was Ben Kuhl.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Starving for Wisdom", "Date": "2015-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom.\u201dThat epigram from E.O. Wilson captures the dilemma of our era. Yet the solution of some folks is to disdain wisdom.First, liberal arts equip students with communications and interpersonal skills that are valuable and genuinely rewarded in the labor force, especially when accompanied by technical abilities.\u201cSo I think a humanities major who also did a lot of computer science, economics, psychology, or other sciences can be quite valuable and have great career flexibility,\u201d Katz said. \u201cBut you need both, in my view, to maximize your potential. And an economics major or computer science major or biology or engineering or physics major who takes serious courses in the humanities and history also will be a much more valuable scientist, financial professional, economist, or entrepreneur.\u201dMy second reason: We need people conversant with the humanities to help reach wise public policy decisions, even about the sciences. Technology companies must constantly weigh ethical decisions: Where should Facebook set its privacy defaults, and should it tolerate glimpses of nudity? Should Twitter close accounts that seem sympathetic to terrorists? How should Google handle sex and violence, or defamatory articles? To weigh these issues, regulators should be informed by first-rate science, but also by first-rate humanism. After all, Homer addressed similar issues three millenniums ago.In \u201cThe Odyssey,\u201d the beautiful nymph Calypso offers immortality to Odysseus if he will stay on her island. After a fling with her, Odysseus ultimately rejects the offer because he misses his wife, Penelope. He turns down godlike immortality to embrace suffering and death that are essential to the human condition. Third, wherever our careers lie, much of our happiness depends upon our interactions with those around us, and there\u2019s some evidence that literature nurtures a richer emotional intelligence.Science magazine published five studies indicating that research subjects who read literary fiction did better at assessing the feelings of a person in a photo than those who read nonfiction or popular fiction. Literature seems to offer lessons in human nature that help us decode the world around us and be better friends.In short, it makes eminent sense to study coding and statistics today, but also history and literature.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Opens Corruption Inquiry Into Sinopec President", "Date": "2015-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The second-ranking executive at Sinopec, one of China\u2019s dominant oil and energy companies, is being investigated for \u201cserious violations\u201d of laws and discipline, according to official news reports and a statement by the commission of the Chinese Communist Party that oversees corruption investigations.The move against Mr. Wang by party investigators at the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection indicates that senior party officials under Xi Jinping, the party chief and Chinese president, are expanding their scrutiny of top executives at giant state-owned oil and energy enterprises. Until now, antigraft cases in the oil industry have mainly focused on one of Sinopec\u2019s rivals, China National Petroleum Corporation.Mr. Jiang, a former member of the party\u2019s elite Central Committee, became director of a government agency overseeing state enterprises in March 2013, but he was removed from that post six months later and placed under investigation by party officials. He was expelled from the party in 2014 and put on trial this month on corruption charges. He confessed during the trial to taking huge bribes, and prosecutors said Mr. Jiang had aided Mr. Zhou in corrupt schemes.Mr. Jiang\u2019s downfall is a template for what could happen to Mr. Wang and possibly other executives at Sinopec, which is also known as the China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation.Though Mr. Zhou was known to be a prominent figure in the oil industry, it was not immediately clear whether the investigation into Mr. Wang was related to the inquiry into Mr. Zhou.Some economists and political analysts say Mr. Xi is sincere about trying to break the tight grip of state-owned enterprises on the Chinese economy and about forcing those enterprises to change the way they operate. The investigations into C.N.P.C. and Sinopec could be one means of doing that in the oil and energy industry, as well as a means of purging Mr. Xi\u2019s political opponents, Mr. Zhou among them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cooper Union Inquiry Puts Nonprofits on Notice", "Date": "2015-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIn what should be a ringing alarm for nonprofit boards across the country long accustomed to minimal scrutiny or accountability, Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York has signaled that the laissez-faire approach to nonprofit governance is over.Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office has sent letters to the board members of Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, the prestigious college founded in Manhattan in 1859 by the philanthropist Peter Cooper on the premise that it be \u201copen and free to all.\u201d Last year, after the school said it faced financial ruin otherwise, it began charging tuition.Apart from the impact on Cooper Union itself, what\u2019s striking about Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s investigation is that his office is intervening before its financial problems ruin the school. Cooper Union\u2019s endowment stood at $735 million at the end of its most recent fiscal year and, despite its financial woes, it is in no imminent danger of failing.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget, but New York\u2019s charities, collectively, are a big and important part of our state\u2019s economy, and I consider it my responsibility to promote and protect the nonprofit sector,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman told me this week. \u201cIn part, we do that by aggressively investigating and prosecuting fraud. But we work just as hard to prevent mismanagement before it starts and, whenever possible, get troubled charities back on track.\u201dThe Cooper Union investigation fits into the New York attorney general\u2019s office\u2019s broader strategy to get ahead of potential crises by \u201cstress testing\u201d nonprofits that show signs of potential trouble, such as large operating deficits and excessive spending rates on endowments, said James Sheehan, the chief of the office\u2019s charities bureau. \u201cOnce an organization is in trouble, donors don\u2019t want to give money and people don\u2019t want to join the board,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want people to anticipate these issues before they become disasters.\u201dSuch disasters have befallen the New York City Opera and Long Island College Hospital, two major New York institutions that collapsed in financial disarray in recent years, and the Crystal Cathedral in California, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2010 after accusations that its board had imprudently borrowed against the endowment.Whatever the outcome at Cooper Union, Mr. Schneiderman deserves credit for putting nonprofit boards on notice that they\u2019ll be held accountable, said Jack B. Siegel, author of a widely used guide for nonprofit directors, whose subtitle is \u201cAvoiding Trouble While Doing Good.\u201d \u201cMore states should emulate New York,\u201d Mr. Siegel said.State attorneys general oversee nonprofits both because they\u2019re generally exempt from state taxes and because they represent the interests of donors who may lack the means to enforce the terms of their gifts or, once they\u2019re dead, the capacity. (Since such institutions are also exempt from federal taxes, the Internal Revenue Service is charged with ensuring that organizations adhere to their tax-exempt purposes.)Mr. Siegel said New York\u2019s charities division \u201cis really active, does a lot of investigations and really does go after people.\u201d For most state attorneys general, he said, \u201ctheir main focus in life isn\u2019t charities and nonprofits.\u201dIn large degree, this is a simple matter of capacity. The New York attorney general alone oversees about 80,000 nonprofits, ranging from world-renowned institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Opera to little-known historic house museums. Given limited resources, \u201cwe have no choice but to go after the most egregious examples,\u201d Mr. Sheehan said. He cited the example from last year of William Rapfogel, a close friend of the now-disgraced assembly leader Sheldon Silver, who was executive director of the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty. He was sentenced to a prison term after pleading guilty to plundering the charity of more than $9 million.But most cases of nonprofit mismanagement involve breaches of fiduciary duty, not criminal behavior, often rooted in a sincere if ultimately misguided effort to help. Board members are typically \u201cpeople who are generous donors who support the mission of the institution,\u201d Mr. Sheehan said. \u201cThere\u2019s a culture of politeness and respect, and they support the chief executive. Most chief executives don\u2019t want board members to ask tough questions. This is especially true when you have a charismatic leader.\u201dCooper Union\u2019s board took a series of financial steps that, with benefit of hindsight, seem misguided. The school borrowed $175 million for 30 years at a rate of 5.75 percent and then spent most of the proceeds on a lavish new building while continuing to run operating deficits. It also agreed to a prohibitively expensive prepayment penalty, making it financially impossible to extricate itself from the terms of the loan, according to people with knowledge of the agreement who spoke on the condition of anonymity. One of the issues in the current investigation is whether Cooper Union disclosed this potential penalty when it sought court approval for the loan.But such investments are typically burdened with high fees, and their returns in recent years have been disappointing. Cooper Union\u2019s endowment increased 6.1 percent for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, and a meager 1.65 percent if the Chrysler Building is excluded. By comparison, the average endowment return for colleges and universities for the same period was 15.5 percent, according to the National Association of College and University Business Officers-Commonfund Study of Endowments.Justin Harmon, a spokesman for Cooper Union, said the board\u2019s investment committee had a new head who was taking a \u201cfresh look\u201d at its asset allocation strategy. School officials have \u201cengaged in regular briefings with the attorney general\u2019s office since realizing that the Cooper Union\u2019s financial circumstances would likely require us to change its financial mode,\u201d Mr. Harmon said. \u201cWe are cooperating fully and providing as much information and perspective as we can.\u201dUnder New York\u2019s nonprofit statute, the attorney general can seek sweeping remedies, including putting an institution into receivership, ousting managers and board members or even forcing dissolution of the institution. But no one wants to see such an outcome at Cooper Union, which remains a crown jewel in American higher education. Accountability for any past misdeeds is important, especially if the continuing dissension and distrust among trustees, administration, faculty, alumni and students is ever to heal.But that\u2019s not going to restore Peter Cooper\u2019s dream of free tuition. For that, the school needs a sound financial plan that will regain the confidence of donors, faculty and prospective students. By intervening now, the attorney general might well be able to achieve that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economics of Suspense", "Date": "2015-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray MatterIMAGINE the following situation. After a grueling day at work, you plop down in front of your TV, ready to relax. Your TiVo has recorded all of the day\u2019s March Madness games. You\u2019ve sequestered yourself away from any news about who won or lost. Which game to watch? Suddenly, your spouse pops in and tells you to stay away from Villanova versus Lafayette, which was a blowout, and to watch Baylor versus Georgia State, a nail-biter.Is this recommendation appreciated? Hardly. Baylor versus Georgia State was exciting because the unexpected happened: It was a back-and-forth affair in which Georgia State, the underdog, clinched the upset only in the final moments. But if you know in advance that it\u2019s a nail-biter, you will expect the unexpected, ruining the surprise. It\u2019s a lesson that the filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan, for one, seems to have missed. Once it\u2019s common knowledge that your movie will have a dramatic, unexpected plot twist at the end, then your movie no longer has a dramatic, unexpected plot twist at the end.To be thrilling, you must occasionally be boring.We began our analysis by noticing a certain similarity. In a number of settings \u2014 watching basketball games, reading mystery novels, gambling in a casino \u2014 people are invested in learning the outcome (which team will win, who is the murderer, will I walk out flush or broke), but they do not wish to learn the outcome too quickly. In all of these settings, a key aspect of entertainment is the revelation of information over time.Information revealed over time generates drama in two ways: suspense and surprise. Suspense is experienced before the fact, when something informative is about to happen. Think about a baseball scenario: bases loaded, full count, two men out. We say that a moment has a lot of suspense if there is a lot of uncertainty about what you will soon think about the outcome.Surprise, on the other hand, is experienced after the fact. We are surprised if something unexpected has just happened. Think about a soccer goalie scoring from a goal kick. We say that a moment has a lot of surprise if your belief about the outcome is very different from what you thought a moment ago.Once these concepts are formalized in this way, the question of how to maximize entertainment \u2014 that is, how to generate the most suspense or the most surprise \u2014 becomes a mathematical problem that can be tackled on a whiteboard. The solution yields some simple insights (for example, remember occasionally to be boring) but also many nuanced ones. For instance, to maximize suspense, a mystery novel should have no more than three major plot twists on average. Of course, that last qualification is crucial: The exact number of plot twists should be unpredictable.We can also determine how a change in rules (in a card game or a sport) would have an impact on entertainment. In the context of casino gambling, our computations show that eliminating the ability to split and double-down in blackjack would reduce both suspense and surprise. In sports, elimination tournaments like March Madness are seeded so that the top two teams are expected to meet in the final. But top seeds may be eliminated early on. That\u2019s exciting when it happens, but that excitement comes at the cost of a less dramatic final. Could it be more exciting to have the top seeds play in the first round, then let the other teams compete for a chance to unseat the victor? Our analysis shows that this rule change would increase the overall surprise value of the tournament but would have ambiguous effects on suspense. Playoff series in baseball feature an intriguing trade-off. The longer the series, the less consequential each individual game is. Imagine the tedium of a best-of-99 series. On the other hand, if the series is too short, then there is too little time for the suspense to build. We found that the typical five- or seven-game series works well because it allows uncertainty about the eventual winner as well as large swings in the likely outcome with each passing game. In general, the more evenly the teams are matched, the longer is the optimal series.Academic analysis of the determinants of entertainment is in its infancy. Future work, whether built on information theory or not, should help us better understand why we are moved by certain sports, novels and games. This might help us design better entertainment. More important, it will lead us to better understand the human psyche.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s G.D.P. Slows to 7 Percent, the Weakest Rate Since 2009", "Date": "2015-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s economy grew in the first three months of 2015 at its slowest quarterly pace in six years, dragged down by an industrial slowdown and a weak housing market, the government announced Wednesday.Gross domestic product rose 7 percent from a year earlier, in line with economists\u2019 forecasts. While the growth rate means China still ranks as one of the world\u2019s fastest growing major economies, it marked the country\u2019s slowest quarterly expansion since early 2009, when it was still feeling the effects of the global financial crisis.China\u2019s Communist Party leadership has lowered its official growth target for this year to around 7 percent. This would be the nation\u2019s slowest annual expansion in 25 years, but leaders have said this is a price that needs to be paid in order to reduce the economy\u2019s reliance on credit-fueled growth and get everyday shoppers to spend more of their savings.Recent indicators suggest that the economy could be slowing more rapidly than many observers expected. In March, industrial production rose 5.6 percent from a year ago, its slowest increase since late 2008. Land purchases by real estate developers plunged 32 percent by area in the first three months of the year.The pace of growth in the first quarter \u201csupported quite ample employment, and residents\u2019 incomes have also risen in step,\u201d the Beijing News said, summarizing Mr. Li\u2019s comments.\u201cBut on the other hand we must see that downward economic pressure indeed continues to grow,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cSome of our traditional sources of strength are receding, and at the same time there are newly emerging sources of growth, and some sunrise industries are experiencing explosive growth.\u201dFor example, retail sales in March rose 10.2 percent, the slowest increase in nearly a decade. But online merchandise sales increased 41 percent in the first quarter, and now account for about 9 percent of all sales of consumer goods in China.Foreign trade, by contrast, has been buffeted by lackluster overseas shipments and signs of even weaker demand at home. Exports of goods by value rose only five percent in the first three months of the year, while imports slumped 17 percent, weighed down by lower global prices for oil and other commodities.The housing market continues to struggle, with home prices falling and new construction starts declining. This has far-ranging effects at home and abroad, including on domestic steel production, pricing of imported iron ore from Australia and the employment of sales agents at property brokerages across China.Sheng Laiyun, the spokesman for China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics, said that \u201cdownward pressure\u201d on the Chinese economy came from both external factors, including the tepid recovery of many economies, and also from domestic factors. New sources of growth were emerging, he said, \u201cbut in the short term it\u2019s difficult for them to make up for the subsiding of traditional drivers.\u201dChina\u2019s leaders have responded to the slowdown by easing monetary policy but have held off from introducing more aggressive stimulus measures. Since November, the central bank has cut interest rates twice and freed up banks to lend more. Most economists expect further cuts in the coming weeks or months.These measures do appear to be having an effect, with key short-term borrowing rates in China\u2019s money market, an important indicator of the real cost of funding for smaller banks and other financial institutions, falling to around 3 percent in the past week, down from around 5 percent in February.Despite this, there are still few signs that the government\u2019s efforts at weaning the country off of credit fueled growth are succeeding. Total credit growth has slowed in recent months, but it is still outpacing G.D.P. growth, meaning China as a whole is growing more indebted. The biggest factor here continues to be the increase in corporate borrowing.In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Li emphasized that the government would persist with planned economic and financial overhauls despite slowing growth.\u201cOur toolbox still has many policy tools, and the biggest tool is reform,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cThere certainly is pressure now, and the pressure on some sectors is quite heavy. But there is also impetus, and many businesses take a positive long-term view of this market,\u201d he added.Chris Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Greece\u2019s creditors committed to debt relief, although not until 2018 at the earliest, provided the country continues to carry out painful changes.In the European Union, most real decision-making power, particularly on matters involving politically delicate things like money and migrants, rests with 28 national governments, each one beholden to its voters and taxpayers. This tension has grown only more acute since the January 1999 introduction of the euro, which binds 19 nations into a single currency zone watched over by the European Central Bank but leaves budget and tax policy in the hands of each country, an arrangement that some economists believe was doomed from the start. Since Greece\u2019s debt crisis began in 2010, most international banks and foreign investors have sold their Greek bonds and other holdings, so they are no longer vulnerable to what happens in Greece. (Some private investors who subsequently plowed back into Greek bonds, betting on a comeback, regret that decision.)

With global financial markets still reeling, Greece announced in October 2009 that it had been understating its deficit figures for years, raising alarms about the soundness of Greek finances. Suddenly, Greece was shut out from borrowing in the financial markets. By the spring of 2010, it was veering toward bankruptcy, which threatened to set off a new financial crisis. To avert calamity, the so-called troika \u2014 the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission \u2014 issued the first of two international bailouts for Greece, which would eventually total more than \u20ac240 billion. The bailouts came with conditions. Lenders imposed harsh austerity terms, requiring deep budget cuts and steep tax increases. They also required Greece to overhaul its economy by streamlining the government, ending tax evasion and making Greece an easier place to do business. The money was supposed to buy Greece time to stabilize its finances and quell market fears that the euro union itself could break up. While it has helped, Greece\u2019s economic problems have not gone away. The economy has shrunk by a quarter in five years, and unemployment is about 25 percent. The bailout money mainly goes toward paying off Greece\u2019s international loans, rather than making its way into the economy. And the government still has a staggering debt load that it cannot begin to pay down unless a recovery takes hold. The government will now need to continue putting in place deep economic overhauls required by the bailout deal Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras brokered in August, as well as the unwinding of capital controls introduced after political upheaval prompted a run on Greek banks. Greece\u2019s relations with Europe are in a fragile state, and several of its leaders are showing impatience, unlikely to tolerate the foot-dragging of past administrations. Under the terms of the bailout, Greece must continue to pass deep-reaching overhauls, many of them measures that were supposed to have been passed years ago.

Counting deaths is so familiar that few have thought to question it. But death toll alone says nothing about how long people live, and good health is much more than not being dead.Focusing on disability-adjusted life years may sound convoluted compared with simple lives lost. But it more closely aligns with most people\u2019s intuitive sense of how health really works. Say, for example, that I\u2019m in a paralyzing car crash at age 35, but survive until age 65, when I die (alas) from a heart attack. Then, assuming an ideal life span of 85 years, I lost 20 years of potential life to the heart attack. But, because I lived 30 years with paralysis after the car crash, the crash cost me the equivalent of 15 years of healthy life. My total health loss is 35 DALYs, a figure that accounts both for the health loss from the fatal heart attack and the health loss from the nonfatal car crash.Just as baseball and other sports have been transformed by our understanding of new numbers, public and global health can be, too.The same kind of analysis works even better at a national level, where most health spending takes place, because current health care gaps usually correlate much more with the leading causes of DALYs than the leading causes of deaths. As Mexico moved to a universal health care system in the last decade, it used this type of analysis to prioritize those treatments \u2014 like medications for childhood cancers, and emergency care after a car accident \u2014 that reduce DALYs the most.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s fine to build more storage and transport facilities, but it is also time to revisit major water infrastructure to provide additional supplies to the Southwest, where Americans keep moving.For example, studies in the 1950s looked at the viability of flooding the Rocky Mountain Trench in British Columbia and bringing water south; such ideas should be reviewed.RICHARD P.

Rarely are Americans asked to sacrifice, and when it becomes mandatory, the stakes for politicians rise.I have a question in this increasingly polarized, class-based society: Will the rich just pay the fines, while poorer sections of California suffer the consequences of water restrictions?JOHN S. TREDWAYVenice, Fla.To the Editor:In California\u2019s worst drought in over 1,200 years, Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s reproach that we can\u2019t live the way we always have speaks volumes about the severity of what\u2019s happening. While residents and small businesses are rightly required to cut back on water use and the state figures out how to deal with an agricultural sector that feeds the country, we must also look closely at an oil industry that is trying to keep drilling the way it always has.Thanks to some investigative reporting in the state, we know that the industry is blatantly disregarding regulations that protect our groundwater from oil waste and fracking chemicals. In the past few years, Big Oil alone has been responsible for polluting billions of gallons of what was once drinkable water. As we figure out how to preserve a livable California, Californians deserve an oil industry that is held to the same standards as the rest of us.DAN JACOBSONState DirectorEnvironment CaliforniaSacramentoTo the Editor:The most striking statistic in this article has nothing to do with water consumption or population increase, but the fact that California has the seventh largest economy in the world. What that means is that we are all invested in the future of this state \u2014 even those of us as far away as the East Coast.The economic viability of California is fundamental to our national economy.

Another state, or even part of the world, might be better suited for food production if this drought proves to be a long-term shift in the climate.Beat it, lettuce fields!

No more than 37 gallons per day for each resident in one\u2019s home. We captured shower water in a large plastic tubs and used that water to flush toilets and water gardens. One would think that California would have found a solution that was staring it in the face even then.Currently 80 percent of water use in California is for agriculture. If you drive Interstate 5 between Sacramento and Los Angeles, you go through the San Joaquin Valley, frequently called the \u201cbreadbasket\u201d of the United States. You will see megafarm after megafarm blowing huge quantities of water into the air before it falls on the crops below. This practice must be outlawed.If Gov. Jerry Brown were to call Israel\u2019s minister in charge of agriculture, he would find his solution to the water shortage. Israel, which is mostly desert, grows its food using drip irrigation, which uses only a tiny fraction of the amount of water used by the huge sprinklers in California.Wake up, Governor Brown; there is an easy solution. It should have been implemented in the mid-1970s.ROBERT W. HIRSCHUpper Gwynedd, Pa.Advertisement"}

He is shopping for a Hollywood studio.As his real estate and entertainment empire expands overseas, Mr. Wang, 60, has emerged as the rare private-sector tycoon in a position to advance Beijing\u2019s interests abroad, with clout in industries and communities around the world.How the son of a foot soldier in Mao Zedong\u2019s Communist Revolution catapulted into the top tier of the global elite is an archetypal story of China\u2019s transition to capitalism and the outsize opportunities it presents those with talent or connections \u2014 or, in Mr. Wang\u2019s case, both. His story, though, is also singular: He built one of the world\u2019s most valuable real estate portfolios in a nation where the state retains ownership of all land.A yearlong examination of his success by The New York Times casts a light on the murky intersection of business and power at the heights of the Chinese economy, where market competition is often warped by the whims of Communist Party leaders.Entrepreneurs have powered rapid growth in China for more than three decades. But even the most successful businessmen here must still reach some accommodation with the party, which only a generation ago operated a socialist planned economy.Mr. Wang says he has prospered by delivering what ambitious party officials crave: choice real estate developments that propel economic growth and bolster their careers.

Since building the first one in the northeastern city of Changchun in 2002, he has opened more than 100 of them in at least 70 other Chinese cities, generating the revenue that now finances his ambitions abroad.But there is an aspect of his relationship with the authorities that Mr. Wang never raises in interviews and that has gone unreported in the many accounts of his success published in China and abroad: Relatives of some of the nation\u2019s most powerful politicians and their business associates own significant stakes in his company.An extensive review of corporate records filed with the government identified several such investments made from 2007 to 2011, when Wanda was privately held and rarely sold shares to outsiders.Other early investors included a business partner of the daughter of former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, and relatives of two other members of the ruling Politburo at the time, Jia Qinglin and Wang Zhaoguo, according to the records and interviews with family members and business associates.There is no indication that any of the politicians whose relatives and business associates owned shares in Wanda intervened on the company\u2019s behalf in any of its dealings with the government. Nor is there evidence that any of the politicians personally benefited from the windfall that these investors reaped. The investors and officials did not respond to written questions or could not be reached for comment.Mr. Wang declined an interview request and did not respond to written questions submitted to Wanda. But in public remarks, he often uses the same phrase to describe how he manages his relationship with the authorities: \u201cStay close to the government and distant from politics.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that China\u2019s economy is government-led, and the real estate industry depends on approvals, so if you say you can ignore the government in this business, I\u2019d say that\u2019s impossible,\u201d Mr. Wang told state television in a February interview. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s hypocritical and fake to say that. ... But at the same time, for example, we don\u2019t pay bribes.\u201dA Remarkable Winning StreakIt was September 2012, and students at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard were spellbound by an unusual lecturer, a short, plain-talking man with close-set eyes and a prominent widow\u2019s peak.It would not have been a particularly incisive observation from a member of the faculty. But the speaker that afternoon was Mr. Wang, and despite the hardships that he described, he was on a remarkable winning streak.Months earlier, Mr. Wang had purchased AMC Entertainment Holdings, the second-largest theater chain in the United States. By year\u2019s end, his empire in China would include 66 Wanda Plazas, 38 five-star hotels, 980 cinema screens and 57 department stores, not to mention 63 karaoke saloons. Within a year, he would break ground on an $8 billion movie studio and theme park in the coastal city of Qingdao, flying in stars such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Nicole Kidman and John Travolta to celebrate.With success came the familiar trappings of the megarich. Mr. Wang bought a Picasso painting at auction for $28.2 million. His wife socialized with Prince Albert of Monaco. His son hired a top Korean pop group to perform at his 27th birthday party.Not content with just owning a yacht, Mr. Wang bought the British company that makes the luxury boats seen in James Bond films. In January, his company announced it was buying a stake in a Spanish soccer club.\u201cHe is a force of nature,\u201d said Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chief executive of DreamWorks Animation, who has known Mr. Wang for three years. \u201cHe is a very, very strong personality, and he is extremely confident about what he is doing.\u201dMr. Wang\u2019s father was a veteran of the Communist Party\u2019s Long March, the arduous and deadly trek across China in the 1930s by the Communists that hardened a generation of revolutionaries, and Mr. Wang himself, the eldest of five brothers, followed him into the army as a teenager. In a 2013 appearance on state television, he recalled marching hundreds of miles through knee-deep snow in training exercises during Mao\u2019s fanatical Cultural Revolution.\u201cMany people couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d Mr. Wang said, but he did. He then spent the next 16 years rising through the officer ranks, an experience that colleagues say informs his management style. Even his most senior Wanda executives are required to punch in and out, for example, and tardiness is not tolerated, former employees say.After leaving the military, Mr. Wang took a government job in the northeastern port city of Dalian. His big break there came in 1988, when he was transferred to a failing state-owned builder of residential apartment blocks. By his own account, he secured a loan with the help of an old army buddy and returned the company to profitability.In 1992, the firm was restructured as one of China\u2019s first shareholding companies, and over the next decade, Mr. Wang oversaw its privatization, emerging as its majority owner.The mayor of Dalian for much of that time was Bo Xilai, a politician who was the son of an influential party elder and who would rise to the Politburo before falling from power in a stunning corruption and murder scandal in 2012.Mr. Wang was an extraordinary benefactor to Dalian during Mr. Bo\u2019s tenure, buying the city\u2019s soccer team, which helped make it a national champion, and donating tens of millions of dollars to build schools.Since Mr. Bo\u2019s fall, Mr. Wang has sought to distance himself from him. In a recent interview, he said he struggled during those years because he refused to pay bribes and did not get along with Mr. Bo. That limited his access to land, he said, which Mr. Bo\u2019s administration would not sell him.Because the state retains formal ownership of all land in China, those who want to build on it must have the state\u2019s blessing. Local governments have depended for years on the sale of long-term rights to develop land to finance their operations. But who gets which parcels, and at what price, is as much a political decision as an economic one.Mr. Wang says his company is so good at delivering benefits to the cities where it builds that local governments now compete for his business and he turns down more than two out of every three proposals.\u201cWe thus can take the initiative, and we have the bargaining power,\u201d he told the students at Harvard. That means he acquires land at less than half the cost to his competitors, he added.Even as property prices set records in China, the price that Dalian Wanda paid for access to land fell by more than 40 percent from 2011 to 2014, according to its I.P.O. prospectus.Wang Yongping, vice chairman of the China Commercial Real Estate Association, said local officials were eager to work with Wanda because of the tax revenue its projects bring them and because it has a reputation for getting things done fast. The company can finish a Wanda Plaza at what it calls Wanda Speed, or within 18 months.\u201cChinese government officials love to have achievements when they are in office,\u201d Wang Yongping said. \u201cEighteen months might determine whether they can become a district chief or a provincial party secretary.\u201dBut some in power have other reasons to root for Wang Jianlin.A Paper Trail to the EliteIn July 2007, Mr. Wang had built only a handful of Wanda Plazas. He had yet to make his first billion dollars, and few outside China had heard of him or his company. The Hurun Rich List, which tracks the net worth of the wealthiest people in China, ranked him 148th.But late that month, a newly formed firm in Beijing, Minghao Holdings, acquired a 2.5 percent stake in Mr. Wang\u2019s flagship company, Wanda Group, becoming its largest external shareholder, according to corporate records. There was only one other outside shareholder at the time, a local real estate company in Dalian run by a friend.Then, two months later, another newly established firm in Beijing, Wugufeng Investment Consulting, took a 1.53 percent stake in the main company that Mr. Wang used to hold his shares in Wanda Group, becoming its fifth shareholder, the records show.The documents do not indicate why the two Beijing firms were invited to become early investors in Mr. Wang\u2019s business. But the paper trail from the companies leads to relatives of two men sitting at the time on the Communist Party\u2019s ruling Politburo: Jia Qinglin, a longtime party boss of the Beijing municipality who ranked fourth in the party leadership, and Wang Zhaoguo, a senior legislator who was the leading force behind a landmark law providing legal protections for private property.Wang Zhaoguo\u2019s son, Wang Xinyu, was the controlling shareholder of the first firm, which later transferred its stake in Wanda to a young woman named Yang Xin, the records show. Ms. Yang is the Politburo member\u2019s niece, according to Wang Zhao\u2019an, a cousin who serves as party chief in the family\u2019s home village in Hebei Province.The owner of the second firm is listed in the records as Pan Yongbin, 63, who shares a business address, staff and phone numbers with a Beijing investment firm run by Mr. Jia\u2019s son-in-law, Li Botan. Mr. Pan is also listed as a board member of several firms owned by Mr. Li, including his main investment company.As Wanda prospered in the years that followed, the value of these early stakes skyrocketed.The firm controlled by Wang Zhaoguo\u2019s son paid less than $500,000 for its stake, according to Wanda\u2019s filings with the government, though the firm\u2019s own records do not show the transaction. The documents are more complete for the second firm, showing a payment of less than $200,000 for its stake. Those two stakes are now worth more than $640 million and $250 million.Neither Politburo member was in a position to directly set the price or approve the sale of land-use rights to Wanda. But party institutions under the two men have showered Wang Jianlin with public recognition.In March 2008, Mr. Wang was one of only three mainland billionaires named to the standing committee of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Congress, a national advisory body, led by Mr. Jia, that is made up of people whom the party leadership deems influential. The appointment amounted to a seal of approval by top party leaders, said one Chinese businessman who serves on a similar body and spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his position.In June 2007, Mr. Wang was also named an outstanding private entrepreneur by a party-run industry association, the first of five awards bestowed upon him over the next four years from groups led by or associated with Wang Zhaoguo.Honors like these can signal to local officials and potential business partners that their recipients are well connected. \u201cAt least within China, people will be much more willing to do business with you, and much less likely to offend you,\u201d said Victor Shih, a scholar at the University of California, San Diego.After the global financial crisis in late 2008, China\u2019s property market took a nose dive. Real estate stocks in Shanghai ended the year down 65 percent.But Wanda had a banner year, breaking ground on seven new Wanda Plaza complexes \u2014 setting a record \u2014 and propelling Wang Jianlin to 20th on the Hurun list of China\u2019s richest people, with a fortune estimated at $2.3 billion.The next year, Wanda distributed shares to outsiders again, privately selling an 8.5 percent stake in the company.Among the eight new investors was a Beijing firm owned through a network of holding companies by Qi Qiaoqiao, the sister of Xi Jinping, and her husband, Deng Jiagui.Ms. Qi and Mr. Xi are members of a privileged elite consisting of the offspring of senior party officials. Their now deceased father, Xi Zhongxun, was a military comrade of Mao and later became a vice premier and a pioneer of economic reform.Ms. Qi worked in a variety of political and military posts during her career before becoming a businesswoman. During that time, her younger brother, Mr. Xi, was working his way up through the ranks in provincial government posts.It is not known why Ms. Qi and her husband were offered the chance to invest in Wanda. By 2009, she was already a wealthy investor with business relationships across the country. Meanwhile, her brother had become China\u2019s vice president and was the consensus candidate to become the party\u2019s next leader.In many cases, the couple sold their investments to individuals with no clear connection to them.But the shares in Wanda \u2014 valued at $240 million now, up from the $28.6 million the couple paid for them in 2009 \u2014 were transferred to a longtime business associate on Oct. 8, 2013. The records give no indication of the price paid by the business associate, who has served the couple in various corporate posts for more than a decade.Another new shareholder in Wanda was an investment fund owned in part and managed by a subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings, the investment arm of Beijing\u2019s prestigious Tsinghua University. At the time, the top official at Tsinghua Holdings was Hu Haifeng, the son of Hu Jintao, then China\u2019s president. There is no indication Hu Haifeng personally benefited from or held any shares in Wanda himself.Some of the individuals given an early chance to invest in Wanda are difficult to identify. One of them, Jin Yi, acquired a stake in 2009 that is now worth about $250 million. But the address on her identity card is incomplete, and her name is not included on the official registry of residents in the neighborhood listed.Promoting Chinese Culture\u201cThis is a discussion on economics today and shouldn\u2019t delve into politics,\u201d Mr. Wang snapped. \u201cYou are publicly saying bad things about China \u2014 at the very least, I don\u2019t think this is very polite.\u201dAs his fortune has climbed and his investments have stretched overseas, Mr. Wang has emerged as an outspoken advocate for his homeland. In interviews and speeches, he tends to present himself as the pragmatic face of big business in China, delivering a soothing message of opportunity to foreign audiences anxious about the country\u2019s rise.\u201cWang Jianlin is a perfect instrument for that from the party\u2019s point of view,\u201d said Joseph Nye, the Harvard professor who coined the term \u201csoft power\u201d and was the panelist scolded by Mr. Wang at Davos.Mr. Wang is effective in part because he is no longer simply a Chinese real estate developer. As Beijing sought to cool its property sector in recent years, he diversified by shifting investments abroad and into the culture and entertainment sector, including his network of movie theaters, which became the world\u2019s largest in 2012 with the purchase of AMC\u2019s 4,000-plus screens in the United States.The strategy coincided with a policy push by the Chinese leadership to expand the nation\u2019s cultural influence both overseas and at home, where younger generations have increasingly turned to Western music, television and films.A communiqu\u00e9 issued by the party\u2019s Central Committee in October 2011 cited an \u201curgency for China to strengthen its cultural soft power and global cultural influence.\u201d\u201cAfter this document, Wanda started to put a lot of effort into developing the cultural industry,\u201d said Zhang Lihua, a scholar at the Tsinghua-Carnegie Center for Global Policy in Beijing.Investors connected to senior party leaders were able to get in early on Wanda\u2019s move. In December 2010, the investment firm of Mr. Jia\u2019s son-in-law acquired a $9 million stake in Wanda\u2019s cinema subsidiary, records show. As of Monday, the stake was worth $131 million.The Central Committee\u2019s decision resulted in new policies that benefited real estate companies such as Wanda.Local governments, for example, were told to prioritize the sale of land-use rights to companies that built projects that promote Chinese culture. And state-owned banks were told to offer loans for cultural undertakings at home and abroad. The state export-import bank agreed to help finance Wanda\u2019s overseas investments, backing its acquisition of AMC.\u201cNo matter how good Disney is, it is still American culture,\u201d he said after the groundbreaking ceremony last year. \u201cWe hope to use Chinese culture.\u201dXu Han, a scholar at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied the company, said Wanda\u2019s overseas expansion was driven in part by Beijing\u2019s desire to see the nation\u2019s premier companies build a presence abroad. But he said the firm was more interested in profit than in directly influencing public opinion about China.\u201cThe central government\u2019s objective is very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have a very successful Chinese company is good for China.\u201dWhen Mr. Wang bought AMC, he retained the American management team and emphasized that his company would not dictate what films were shown in American theaters.But with China forecast to surpass North America in box office revenue by 2018, Hollywood is already focused on serving Chinese filmgoers and satisfying the censors who determine what foreign films can be shown in Chinese theaters.Mr. Wang often notes that the Chinese market will be twice the size of the North American market by 2023.Foreigners need to heed this new reality, he warned when he hosted Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Kidman for the 2013 groundbreaking of his Qingdao studio.\u201cThose in the world film industry who realize this first and are among the first to cooperate with China,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be the first to reap the benefits.\u201dJonathan Ansfield contributed reporting from Beijing and Shigezhuang, Hebei.

{"Headline": "Push, Don\u2019t Crush, the Students", "Date": "2015-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 PALO ALTO HIGH SCHOOL, one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious public secondary schools, is sandwiched between two stark and illusory paths. Across the street to the west, Stanford University beckons as the platonic ideal, a symbol of the road to Google, the White House, the mansion on the hill. To the east, across a bike trail, are the railroad tracks where three boys from the school district have killed themselves this year. Suicide clusters are relatively rare, accounting for about 5 percent of teenage suicides. Startlingly, this year\u2019s is the second contagion to visit this city. Five students or recent graduates of the district\u2019s other high school, Gunn High School, killed themselves beginning in 2009.Experts say such clusters typically occur when suicide takes hold as a viable coping mechanism \u2014 as a deadly, irrational fashion. But that hasn\u2019t stopped this community from soul searching: Does a culture of hyperachievement deserve any blame for this cluster? The answer is complex, bordering on the contradictory: No, the pressure to succeed is not unique, nor does it cause a suicide cluster in itself, but the intense reflection underway here has unearthed a sobering reality about how Silicon Valley\u2019s culture of best in class is playing out in the schools. In addition to whatever overt pressure students feel to succeed, that culture is intensified by something more insidious: a kind of doublespeak from parents and administrators. They often use all the right language about wanting students to be happy, healthy and resilient \u2014 a veritable \u201cscript,\u201d said Madeline Levine, a Bay Area psychologist who treats depressed, anxious and suicidal tech-industry executives, workers and their children.\u201cThey say, \u2018All I care about is that you\u2019re happy,\u2019 and then the kid walks in the door and the first question is, \u2018How did you do on the math test?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Levine said. \u201cThe giveaways are so unbelievably clear.\u201d Denise Pope, an education expert at Stanford, calls this gulf between what people say and what they mean \u201cthe hidden message of parenting.\u201dBut here, and in lots of other ultrahigh-achieving communities and schools, Ms. Pope said that children are picking through the static to hear the overriding message that only the best will do \u2014 in grades, test scores, sports, art, college. \u201cIn everything,\u201d she said.\u201cI hear students tell me that if I don\u2019t get into X, Y, Z college, I\u2019ll wind up flipping burgers at McDonald\u2019s,\u201d said Ms. Pope, who is working with Ms. Levine to counsel at the high schools.Ms. Pope said that wrongheaded idea becomes an emotional and physiological threat when multiplied by at least three other factors: technology that keeps teens working and socializing late at night, depriving them of essential rest; growing obligations from test-prep classes and extracurricular activities; and parents too busy to participate in activities with their families. There has been lots of talk in the community about what to do, she wrote, but action has not followed. (The district is providing counseling services, offering a suicide-prevention kit and urging teachers to limit homework hours.)\u201cPlease, no more endless discussions about what exactly it is that is wrong with our schools, and, above all, no more empty promises,\u201d she wrote, and noted: \u201cWe are the product of a generation of Palo Altans that so desperately wants us to succeed but does not understand our needs.\u201dTHIS curious idea of a rhetorical divide came up in a number of recent discussions with parents and their children. In one conversation about the suicides, a mother at a Bay Area school in a similarly high-achieving community told me how little pressure she puts on her teens and noted by way of an anecdote how she had succeeded: Her daughter, she proudly recounted, was so well balanced that she decided last year not to go to the best college she got into but, rather, the school that best fit her passions. The school was Vassar.In this subtle linguistic slip, Vassar qualified as a second-rate school.Esther Wojcicki, the teacher who oversees the Palo Alto High School newspaper, lamented the competitive environment but noted seconds later that the school paper had just won a \u201cGold Crown\u201d award from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and that the two dozen students sitting at computer terminals at 4 p.m. that day were thrilled to stay until 9 p.m. to put out the school magazine because they have so much fun doing it. Alan Eagle, a sales director at Google whose 17-year-old son, William, is a junior at Gunn, was frank about the distance between what he tells his son and what he means.He added: \u201cI personally went to Dartmouth and it did help. I look at the economy, the difference between haves and have-nots, and I believe a college education is critical.\u201dAnd a rich high school experience, too. A few minutes later, while acknowledging that his son had given up playing on the basketball team to study more, Mr. Eagle noted that \u201cat least he\u2019s still got track.\u201dGlenn McGee, the district\u2019s superintendent, also seemed to struggle to walk the line between celebrating the exceptional nature of this area while urging students to relax. Sitting in his office and looking across the street at the Stanford campus, he mourned the fact that some parents feel that such a school is the only acceptable outcome. \u201cIn many cases, people have made a big sacrifice to live in this community,\u201d Dr. McGee said, referring to exorbitant housing costs (the median housing price last year was $3.3 million, making it the fourth most-expensive ZIP code in the country, according to Richard Florida, an academic who studies demographic trends). Characterizing the attitude of many parents, Dr. McGee said, \u201cTo be blunt, what is my return on investment?\u201d\u201cMy job is not to get you into Stanford,\u201d he said he tells parents and students. \u201cIt\u2019s to teach them to learn how to learn, to think, to work together \u2014 learn how to explore, collaborate, learn to be curious and creative.\u201d Some parents hear it, he said, but \u201ca lot of families and parents don\u2019t hear the message and say: compete and compete.\u201dDr. McGee said he had interviewed 300 students and found that half would be \u201creally embarrassed\u201d to tell their friends they got a B. But the truth is that it\u2019s awfully hard to be the best here, given the curve: The SAT scores are so high on average that a student who finishes in the 75th percentile in the district has a 2,200, the 99th percentile in general for college-bound seniors. And why wouldn\u2019t he rave? Why not be thrilled by achievement? Because the bar for academic success here has become so high that solid performance can feel mediocre.It puts enormous pressure on a school, or a community, when such consistent, across-the-board greatness becomes a baseline of sorts \u2014 what Mr. Eagle described as a culture of \u201cnot just excellence but uber-excellence.\u201dPerhaps that explains some of the doublespeak: Parents are searching for language to encourage their children, even push them, but not crush them.One solution, said Ms. Pope of Stanford, is \u201cdowntime, playtime, family time.\u201d For parents, too. In other words: Take a leap of faith (well supported by science) that downtime will lead to a healthier perspective.Dr. Morton Silverman, a psychiatrist and senior science adviser to the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, suggested that another answer is recognizing that the doublespeak also betrays a sense of terror about the future among both students and parents.With the economy in flux and the income gap growing, parents don\u2019t see a clear path anymore to financial stability \u2014 even here, maybe especially here, where things move fast and competition is fierce. In addition, many of the fortunes made here have been based on creating things that destabilize traditional businesses and their workers.So confront the new realities, Dr. Silverman suggested, urging parents to say something like: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you which path to take or how to get there, but I will support you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to back you up.\u201dIt\u2019s a hard message to hear in a can-do place like this.Walking near the train tracks where the children laid themselves down, Dr. McGee said this community, if any, should have answers. \u201cCan we put sensors up there?\u201d he mused quietly to me, maybe to alert the train operators that someone has climbed onto the tracks. \u201cThis is Silicon Valley. There ought to be something we can do.\u201d A reporter for The New York Times and the author, most recently, of the novel \u201cThe Doomsday Equation.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Enter Scott Walker, Stage Right", "Date": "2015-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalker\u2019s re-creation of his political identity is a test of whether a Republican presidential candidate can win on the basis of decisive margins among whites (while getting crushed among minority voters).Walker hopes to stand apart from Jeb Bush, a former Florida governor, and Marco Rubio, a Florida senator, who are both taking a more centrist approach. Walker intends to stake out the right side of the Republican spectrum and trump competitors for this niche like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.Even as he shifts to the right, however, Walker, a preternaturally careful candidate, is avoiding any explicit suggestion that he is the champion of disaffected white voters. Still, key policy positions \u2014 particularly his changing stance on immigration and his attacks on public sector unions \u2014 reveal a thoughtfully directed appeal. In 2011, Walker successfully sponsored legislation repealing most collective bargaining rights for government employees. Walker\u2019s anti-union initiative has made him a folk hero to conservatives concerned about what they see as the expanding power of government.Bennett and Walker contend that gutting the power of public sector unions serves as a vehicle to disempower African-American workers, \u201cfor whom the public sector is the single most important source of employment.\u201dAccording the authors, the purpose of the attacks on public employees is to suggest that \u201cthose who receive from the taxpayers are dependent and morally corrupt. The link to blackness is silent and efficient.\u201dThe authors cite a number of letters to the editor published in newspapers during the controversy over Walker\u2019s attack on Wisconsin public employee unions, including this one about striking city teachers:I am sick and tired of hearing how hard teachers work. Everybody I know works hard and they do it 12 months a year, have less benefits, pay for their benefits, do work for their job at home, work second jobs to make ends meet, have experienced pay cuts, layoffs at their companies and earn the same or less than a teacher when you figure the 12-month work schedule versus a teacher\u2019s nine.Black workers are more likely to be employed in the public sector than are either their white or Hispanic counterparts. In 2011, nearly 20 percent of employed Blacks worked for state, local, or federal government compared to 14.2 percent of Whites.Trende replied:To the extent that his comments and commitments in the primary \u2018lock him in\u2019 for the general election, I think it\u2019s safe to say that your intuition here is correct.It makes the most sense for Walker to run with the strategy out of all the major contenders: He doesn\u2019t have the geographic or demographic connections of a Rubio or a Bush (or a Cruz).His base is in the Upper Midwest, which is where a Republican has to win if he is going to lose places like Virginia and Nevada, and his working-class background might resonate more with these voters than some of the other candidates.Walker seems unconcerned that his approach to minority voters would likely maximize the probability these voters once again vote 80 percent Democratic.Teixeira noted that Mitt Romney lost by four pointseven while getting 59 percent of the white vote. That means Walker would have to do substantially better than Romney among white voters to have a chance to win \u2014 perhaps hitting Reagan\u2019s 1984 levels.Walker appears to be calculating that his recent shift on immigration is another means of boosting white support.If people want to come here and work hard in America, I don\u2019t care whether they come from Mexico or Ireland or Germany or South Africa or anywhere else, I want \u2018em here.At that time, in response to a question from the Herald\u2019s editorial board (\u201cCan you envision a world where, with the right penalties and waiting periods and meet the requirements, where those people could get citizenship?\u201d), Walker replied: \u201cSure. Yeah. I mean, I think it makes sense.\u201dWalker\u2019s shift on social and cultural issues has been more subtle than his attack on public employee unions or his altered stance on immigration.Hi, I\u2019m Scott Walker. I\u2019m pro-life. But there\u2019s no doubt in my mind the decision of whether or not to end a pregnancy is an agonizing one. That\u2019s why I support legislation to increase safety and to provide more information for a woman considering her options. The bill leaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor. Now, reasonable people can disagree on this issue. Our priority is to protect the health and safety of all Wisconsin citizens.\u201cWe prohibited abortions from being covered by Wisconsin health plans in a health insurance exchange,\u201d he told the group, adding \u201cWe also cut off state funding for abortion providers. He also pointed out that \u201cI am defending the constitutional amendment that defines marriage between one man and one woman\u201d and that \u201cI support marriage between one man and one woman.\u201dPolls at this stage are not reliable, but they suggest that Walker could be a credible candidate for the Republican nomination. The general election is a different matter. As Teixeira pointed out, Romney\u2019s 59 percent of the white vote was inadequate, and topping that is a tall order.If Walker continues to hold the lead in the early primary states, his candidacy will challenge the centrist predilections of the Republican establishment.Insofar as Walker\u2019s campaign sustains its early momentum, the party establishment will put increasing pressure on him to constrain any inclination he might have to threaten a powerful business community determined to maintain favorable tax, trade and regulatory policies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Results at Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Show Slower Consumer Banking", "Date": "2015-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe recent ascendance of consumer banking over Wall Street appears to have reversed course, at least for one quarter.The figures from the banks \u2014 the first big financial firms to announce their first-quarter results \u2014 are a promising sign for Wall Street firms that have been struggling with new regulations and slow trading conditions.On the flip side, the results show how consumer banking remains squeezed by low interest rates, even as large banks like Wells Fargo are amassing deposits and making loans as the United States economy brightens. JPMorgan announced that its profit rose 12 percent, to $5.9 billion, or $1.45 a share, compared with $5.27 billion, or $1.28 a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts had expected first-quarter earnings of $1.38 a share.The earnings gain was not achieved by simply cutting costs, as has happened at several of the big banks recently. Instead, JPMorgan increased revenue 4 percent, to $24.8 billion, from $23.9 billion in the quarter a year earlier.Marianne Lake, JPMorgan\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with investors Tuesday morning that the bank experienced \u201cbroad strength in underlying performance.\u201dThe increase in the headline numbers at JPMorgan was driven by improved performance across the bank\u2019s trading desks, which have been struggling in recent quarters. Revenue at the bank\u2019s enormous bond-trading operations jumped 61 percent from the previous quarter. The bank said this was driven by activity in interest rate products, emerging market bonds and currencies.Ms. Lake said that market activity had dropped off somewhat at the beginning of the second quarter but was likely to continue to be higher than it has been in recent years. The strong results from the quarter provide the company with ammunition to use against critics who have said the bank would be better off broken into smaller parts.Investment banking fees also increased at Wells Fargo, jumping 36 percent, to $445 million. But fees from businesses like debt and equity underwriting were not enough to lift the company\u2019s profits from a year ago.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.Still, the bank\u2019s net income of $5.8 billion, or $1.04 a share, topped analysts\u2019 expectations of 98 cents a share. Executives said a reason for the profit decline was related to the settlements of routine tax matters, which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter.John Stumpf, Wells Fargo\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said the fundamentals of the bank\u2019s business had never been stronger, particularly increased deposits and capital levels.\u201cThis is some of the strongest deposit growth I\u2019ve seen in my 30 some years in the company,\u201d Mr. Stumpf said in a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.But that growth could not offset many of the pressures on the bank\u2019s bottom line. The bank said regulatory and compliance costs, in addition to expenses related to its growth initiatives, drove expenses 6 percent higher in the first quarter.Wells\u2019s efficiency ratio \u2014 which is one measure of how the bank is managing expenses \u2014 was 58.8 percent in first quarter, which was at the top end of the range that the bank is seeking to achieve this year.Another important measure of the bank\u2019s profitability also fell. Net interest margin, which is the difference between what the bank makes on lending and what it pays to customers with deposits at the bank, declined to 2.95 percent in the first quarter from 3.2 percent a year ago. Both JPMorgan and Wells reported some bright spots in mortgage lending, which had been in a slump recently.A momentary drop in interest rates in the first quarter fueled a flood of applications for mortgage refinancing, Wells Fargo executives said.The bank reported $44 billion worth of mortgage applications in the pipeline at the end of the first quarter, up from $26 billion at the end of last year.JPMorgan reported a big increase in mortgage originations, which were up 45 percent from a year earlier and 7 percent from the previous quarter. But at JPMorgan, much of the increase came from wealthier households taking out what are known as prime mortgages. The banks also said it was still too early to determine whether the spring selling season \u2014 which will begin to heat up in the second quarter \u2014 will top last year\u2019s disappointing sales activity. \u201cThere is more mortgage credit available, more people have jobs this year and home inventory is somewhat improved,\u201d said John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief financial officer.Shares of JPMorgan rose 1.6 percent, to $63.04, while Wells Fargo fell 0.7 percent, to $54.19.Advertisement"}

And he was put off by steep prices for soft drinks, up to $7 each.The search led him to an office building several blocks from the company\u2019s headquarters at Rockefeller Center. It was one of four sites in Manhattan run by Convene, a stand-alone conference space that opened in 2009.Conference centers like Convene\u2019s provide space for smaller meetings of up to 400 people, access to technology and catering for an all-inclusive price, at rates they say are more competitive than those of nearby hotels.But as companies continue to embrace a new frugality, even with the economy in recovery, nonresidential urban conference centers in office buildings are gaining visibility.\u201cYou avoid the feeling of insignificance you feel at a hotel,\u201d said Christopher J. Kelly, co-founder and president of Convene.Fourteen new members have joined the association in the last two years, Mr. Cooper said, adding that the average meeting size is generally smaller than 100 people. The association\u2019s research shows that just over a third of the meetings are training courses and just under a third are management meetings.\u201cThere\u2019ll be a giant chandelier in the middle of the room, and the d\u00e9cor isn\u2019t necessarily conducive for the meeting space,\u201d she said of hotels. And, she said, about a quarter of attendees have dietary restrictions or food preferences, like the paleo diet, that hotel banquet menus do not always accommodate. \u201cBanquet menus are not as readily on-trend,\u201d she said.The cost of the stand-alone centers varies by location. Metro Meeting Centers in Boston charges $135 per person per day. Convene charges from $99 to $229 a day depending on a group\u2019s technology and food and beverage requirements.Cost aside, Ms. Plitt said booking a stand-alone center required caution. Although the centers may offer sleeping options in partnership with local hotels, bad weather can force delays and cancellations.At Metro Meeting Centers, groups were forced to rearrange their schedules because of Boston\u2019s snowy winter. \u201cWe\u2019ve allowed them to change start and end times and to completely reschedule their meetings,\u201d David Smith, a co-founder and partner, wrote in an email. He said clients dictated hours of operation except when the public transportation system was closed and employees were unable to commute to work.Still, Mr. Carvell said, the bar for a successful meeting tends to be lower at the dedicated spaces. Attendees want the air-conditioning, the lights and the audiovisual systems to work. \u201cA great job means nothing goes wrong,\u201d he said.The real question, Mr. Carvell said, was, \u201cHow are hotels going to respond?\u201dThe charge for a 20-person meeting at that hotel, booked in advance for this May, would be $225 a person. The same meeting not booked through Meetings Simplified would cost $19 more a person.Mr. Hoffman said demand had been brisk. The hotel recently reconfigured space to add a dozen more meeting rooms.In New York, Mr. Zumbrunnen of NBCUniversal estimates he has held about 25 days of events at Convene locations, but the steady relationship may be tapering off. Construction at NBCUniversal\u2019s corporate headquarters is expected to be finished this year.\u201cThis will certainly make many of the things we\u2019ve done at Convene come back to our own dedicated space,\u201d Mr. Zumbrunnen wrote in an email, adding, \u201cI\u2019m confident there will still be times and opportunities that we\u2019ll leverage Convene and other similar facilities.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kris Bryant, the Baseball Players\u2019 Union and a Lesson for Labor", "Date": "2015-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisTo the Major League Baseball Players Association, the move looked to be less about baseball aptitude than money and control: Bryant, 23, who plays third base, had been having a preposterously good spring training, hitting nine home runs and notching a .425 batting average. But if he remained in Triple-A for at least 12 days, it would push back by one year the date on which he would qualify for free agency, allowing the Cubs to buy his services at a potentially steep discount for an extra season.On one level, it is hard to feel sympathy for a baseball prodigy who could well be making $25 million a year in the near future, whether that day arrives in 2021 or 2022. But the dispute over Kris Bryant highlights something that runs deeper across a number of industries: the degree of solidarity between the stars and everyone else may be the key to the future of labor relations.The players\u2019 union complained that Bryant could have been one of the game\u2019s greatest players and the Cubs \u201cstill would have made the decision they made.\u201dTo which management\u2019s de facto representatives \u2014 that is, the league \u2014 responded by wondering why a union that ostensibly exists to protect its members should get so exercised about a player who does not even belong to it yet.\u201cWe do not believe that it is appropriate for the players\u2019 association to make the determination that Kris Bryant should be on the Cubs\u2019 25-man roster while another player, who, unlike Bryant, is a member of its bargaining unit, should be cut or sent to the minor leagues,\u201d Major League Baseball said in a statement.It\u2019s a tactic that management has historically deployed across much of the labor force. Robert Muehlenkamp, who was once executive vice president of 1199, the hospital and health care employees\u2019 union, posited an analogy to the service sector, where the same union may represent highly skilled workers like nurses along with housekeepers and food service workers.Mr. Muehlenkamp said management would tell low-skilled workers they should oppose nurses\u2019 efforts to organize because, in his paraphrasing: \u201cIt\u2019s a zero-sum game. The pot is only so big.\u201dIf, on the other hand, the nurses were already in the union, management would whisper that nurses were subsidizing the health care benefits of their lower-paid colleagues and encourage them to form a separate union. \u201cThey\u2019d say, \u2018Break away from them and we\u2019ll give you\u2019\u00a0\u201d a self-insured plan with the same coverage, Mr. Muehlenkamp said. \u201cAnd then maybe they throw in a bonus to go with it.\u201dBaseball players have generally been immune from such tactics. According to Professor Gilbert, solidarity between the star players and the lesser ones has been critical to their bargaining successes since the mid-1960s, when the players brought on Marvin Miller, a former United Steelworkers economist, to run their union.Most famously, in the run-up to the Major League Baseball strike of 1981, the club owners were determined to scale back the free agency rights the players had won five years earlier. The owners proposed requiring any team that acquired a free agent to compensate the player\u2019s former team with a member of its roster.That approach would have sharply reduced teams\u2019 incentives to sign free agents, except in the case of the most-sought-after players. But the stars held the line, effectively preserving free agency for their less-skilled colleagues.\u201cFrom the standpoint of labor, it was the most principled strike I\u2019ve ever been associated with,\u201d Mr. Miller later wrote. \u201cMany of the players struck not for a better deal for themselves but for a better deal for their colleagues.\u201d There are now superstar doctors and academics, who command enormous attention and earn outsize incomes relative to the average worker in their field. A tiny number of YouTube personalities have become highly compensated, as have a handful of self-published authors via Amazon. And only a few merchants have been able to build million-dollar businesses on the backs of eBay and Etsy.Yet it is not uncommon for the stars of these industries to have common interests with the masses who toil away for far less income. Robert Bruno, a professor of labor relations at the University of Illinois, pointed out that academics of all profiles are increasingly worried about university administrators and state legislators having access to their emails. And doctors in hospitals and clinics have one of the fastest rates of unionization among professionals, Mr. Bruno said, because of the increased stress of dealing with insurance companies.In this relatively new world, the stars face a choice: They can cut their own deals and leave their less-heralded colleagues to fend for themselves. Or they can insist on a higher floor and more protections for everyone.Baseball demonstrates the advantages of the latter approach. The legacy of the stars\u2019 hard-line posture in 1981 is that average players make far more money today than they would have under a more restrictive free-agency arrangement. \u201cThey basically forced the teams to pay more across the board,\u201d Professor Gilbert said. The stars have also been critical to raising the league\u2019s minimum salary over the years.For their part, stars benefit from a union that aggressively polices personnel decisions affecting them \u2014 like the financial calculations that may have led to Kris Bryant\u2019s minor-league demotion.In fact, there are few issues that better unite baseball\u2019s stars and bench surfers than the ease with which teams can deny a player credit for what is essentially a year of service by briefly shipping him to the minors.\u201cEvery player is impacted by this, particularly lesser players,\u201d said Scott Boras, Bryant\u2019s agent. \u201cIt\u2019s usually the 24th, 25th men where they still do it, so they can use them at the minimum salary for four years, rather than three.\u201dOf course, as Mr. Boras said, baseball players have another reason to feel as though their fates are linked to one another\u2019s: \u201cEvery player in the big leagues who is there wants to be on a team that wins. They want a ring, a championship, that\u2019s their goal in life.\u201dIf workers in other industries want steady improvements in their standard of living, they may need to create that same sense of shared purpose.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pope Francis Steps Up Campaign on Climate Change, to Conservatives\u2019 Alarm", "Date": "2015-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Vatican summit meeting will focus on the links between poverty, economic development and climate change, with speeches and panel discussions by climate scientists and religious leaders, and economists like Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia. The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, who is leading efforts to forge the Paris accord, will deliver the opening address.Vatican officials, who have spent more than a year helping Francis prepare his message, have convened several meetings already on the topic. Last month, they met with the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy.In the United States, the encyclical will be accompanied by a 12-week campaign, now being prepared with the participation of some Catholic bishops, to raise the issue of climate change and environmental stewardship in sermons, homilies, news media interviews and letters to newspaper editors, said Dan Misleh, executive director of the Catholic Climate Covenant in Washington.But the effort is already angering a number of American conservatives, among them members of the Heartland Institute, a libertarian group partly funded by the Charles G. Koch Foundation, run by the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers, who oppose climate policy.The institute plans to hold a news conference and panel event in Rome on Tuesday in protest of the Vatican summit meeting. Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, invited the pope to speak to Congress, but some Catholics say that Mr. Boehner should prepare for some uncomfortable moments. Mr. Boehner, who is Catholic, has often criticized the Obama administration for what he calls its \u201cjob killing\u201d environmental agenda.\u201cI think Boehner was out of his mind to invite the pope to speak to Congress,\u201d said the Rev. Thomas Reese, an analyst at the National Catholic Reporter. \u201cCan you imagine what the Republicans will do when he says, \u2018You\u2019ve got to do something about global warming\u2019?\u00a0\u201dIn addition, a number of Catholics \u2014 including Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Bobby Jindal, Chris Christie and Rick Santorum \u2014 are gearing up to compete for the Republican presidential nomination, and most of them question the science of human-caused climate change.Several conservative Catholic intellectuals who expect the pope\u2019s message to bolster the vast majority of scientists who hold that climate change is induced by human activity, including Robert P. George, a Princeton law professor, have published articles reminding Catholics that papal pronouncements on science are not necessarily sound or binding.Timothy E. Wirth, vice chairman of the United Nations Foundation, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen a pope do anything like this. No single individual has as much global sway as he does. What he is doing will resonate in the government of any country that has a leading Catholic constituency.\u201dFrancis, however, is not the first pope to push an environmental message. His predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, called the \u201cgreen pope\u201d by some, wrote about the environment and the impact of climate change in documents that have been collected in a book, \u201cThe Environment.\u201d But Catholic and climate policy experts acknowledge that those works had little substantive impact on global warming policy.Francis\u2019 policy moves on climate change, particularly his use of the encyclical, go far beyond what has come before. Catholics point to other papal encyclicals that have had public policy impacts: Pope Leo XIII\u2019s 1891 encyclical on labor and workers\u2019 rights is believed to have spurred the workers\u2019 rights movement and led to the creation of labor unions.\u201cI think this moves the needle,\u201d said Charles J. Reid Jr., a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law. \u201cBenedict was an ivory-tower academic. He wrote books and hoped they would persuade by reason. But Pope Francis knows how to sell his ideas. He is engaged in the marketplace.\u201dFrancis, who chose the name of St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals and the environment, has had far more influence on the church and public. Born in Argentina, Francis draws cheering crowds from around the world and millions of followers to his social media accounts. He has been embraced for his humility, antipoverty agenda, progressive statements on social issues and efforts to reform the Vatican bureaucracy.This month he said in a Twitter post: \u201cWe need to care for the earth so that it may continue, as God willed, to be a source of life for the entire human family.\u201dThe pope\u2019s influence on the Paris climate accord may be strongest in Latin America. In past years, Latin American countries have resisted efforts to enact climate policy, arguing that developing economies should not have to cut emissions while developed economies continue to pollute.But over the past year, some Latin American governments have signaled a willingness to step forward on climate policy, and this year Mexico became one of the first nations to submit a plan ahead of the Paris talks.Coral Davenport reported from Washington, and Laurie Goodstein from New York.Advertisement"}

His most salient argument is that Tunisia\u2019s future political stability depends on inclusive economic growth. However, in proposing government-to-government assistance and a public-sector \u201cdonor conference,\u201d Mr. Tlili undermines his argument by asserting that governments will drive economic opportunity in the Middle East. Decades of stagnation in the region have shown that economies need foreign direct investment as much as governments need foreign support. While it is critical to ensure that the Tunisian government has full backing, sustainable and organic growth can only come from the private sector \u2014 and that\u2019s where international investment should be directed.This was the position taken by the United States commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on March 5, when they demonstrated America\u2019s ongoing commitment to Tunisia at the 2015 Investment and Entrepreneurship Conference hosted by the Partners for a New Beginning, a public-private partnership, in Tunis. They were joined by representatives from Amazon, Boeing, Cisco, Coca-Cola and Microsoft, among others, who also recognize the importance of foreign direct investment for stability in Tunisia.President Obama\u2019s Cairo speech in June 2009 articulated a framework for a \u201cnew beginning\u201d with the Muslim world. Tunisia is one of the only countries left in the Middle East where that vision is still alive. We must do all we can to uphold it, especially by helping private sector growth and economic opportunity for all Tunisians with a special focus on the youth. It is the youth in Tunisia who will drive this change over the next generation through entrepreneurship and translating ideas into realities on the ground. We must work alongside our Tunisian partners to create a framework to attract investment, aid those entrepreneurs and bridge the skills gap so young Tunisians are prepared and equipped for the work force of tomorrow.Toni Verstandig, WashingtonThe writer is chair of Middle East Programs at the Aspen Institute.The housing glut in ChinaRe \u201cFor China, its strengths have become weaknesses\u201d (Business, March 12): This article exposes the slowdown of the Chinese economy due to the shrinkage of the construction industry, manufacturing and local government spending on infrastructure. The writer seems to argue that real estate construction and manufacturing were China\u2019s strengths. If strength means boosting G.D.P., then that makes sense. But China\u2019s real estate industry was never strong and healthy. It was the pillar of the economy, but an irrational machine, creating housing for the sake of production itself.Hundreds of thousands of high-rises have been built in the last 10 years. According to NetEase (a leading Chinese Internet company and online news platform), the total surface area of national unsold housing is about 620 million square meters; Tianjin, Shenyang and Xian each has more than 20 million square meters of unsold space. If each housing unit is 100 square meters, then China has more than 6 million unsold units nationwide. With thousands of ongoing housing projects, the actual number is no less than daunting.The reality is that China\u2019s housing market is facing severe overcapacity. In most cities, local residents treat the low occupation rate of new residential communities as a matter of fact. Using future housing consumption to boost the Chinese economy is nothing but fantasy.Pengfei Li, BeijingThe writer is a visiting scholar at Beijing City University.Africa\u2019s assault on journalistsRe \u201cAn unsettling complicity\u201d (March 27): What Nicholas Kristof writes about Angola is unsettling, especially as concerns the arrest of the investigative journalist Rafael Marques de Morais, now on trial for criminal defamation of the government by exposing endemic corruption: kleptocracy plus opaque funding by Western corporations, while innocent children perish in poverty. Mr. Marques de Morais\u2019s arrest has a parallel in Eritrea, where Dawit Isaak, along with nine other journalists, has been detained since 2001 for speaking out against the government. As in Angola, all power in Eritrea is concentrated in the hands of its president (since 1993), Isaias Afewerki. The blood of African children and those who fight for human rights is on the hands of the greedy.Miriam Borne, New YorkPrivate cities, exclusive citiesRe \u201cDesigning private cities, open to all\u201d (Opinion, March 17): In their plea for private or proprietary cities, Alex Tabarrok and Shruti Rajagopalan fail to explain how these cities could be \u201copen to all.\u201d Poor people will not be able to buy into them, and commercial enterprise and homeowners will exclude poor people in order to protect their investments.

{"Headline": "Soaring College Tuition: What Is to Blame?", "Date": "2015-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter To the Editor:Paul F. Campos argues that huge state funding cuts to public universities aren\u2019t responsible for increased tuition, and that taxpayer funding has actually increased. That simply doesn\u2019t compute at the University of California, which endured almost $1 billion in state funding cuts during the recession.Mr. Campos blames administrative bloat and high salaries; I disagree. The State of California, for example, funds the University of California system at the same level as it did in 1999 \u2014 even though today we enroll 83,000 more students and have one more campus.The University of California continues to trim costs and increase efficiencies, saving more than $660 million over the past five years. And despite the state funding roller coaster, our robust financial aid helps keep a state university education affordable and ensures that students graduate with little or no debt.But efficiencies, cost-cutting and bolstered fund-raising alone can\u2019t make up for a $1 billion reduction in state funding without negatively affecting academic quality and enrollment growth. That simple math is why we announced a contingency plan to raise tuition if state funding doesn\u2019t increase.NATHAN BROSTROMChief Financial OfficerUniversity of CaliforniaOakland, Calif.To the Editor:As a university faculty member, I appreciate Paul F. Campos\u2019s diagnosis that administrative costs, not faculty salaries, are the chief culprit in the soaring cost of higher education. I wish, however, that Mr. Campos had noted at least a few of the many justifiable reasons for the increase in administrative costs over the past few decades.He does not mention, for example, that increased regulation of higher education (in student privacy, disability accommodation and many other areas) has generated a need for networks of administrative staff that did not exist several decades ago. Nor does he discuss market-driven expansions in student services like career development (increasingly necessary in an economy where a college degree lacks the cachet it once had) and academic support (required in part to make up for deficiencies in K-through-12 education).Higher education is a much more complex system than it was during Mr. Campos\u2019s \u201cgolden age\u201d of the 1960s. Like it or not, that complexity comes with a price tag. A key question going forward is who should bear the largest brunt of these costs: the public as a whole, for which an effective system of higher education produces many benefits, or individual students and their families, in the form of tuition increases.By suggesting that the problem can be solved simply by cutting administrators\u2019 salaries, Mr. Campos obscures this difficult choice.CHRISTOPHER J. PETERSBaltimore The writer is a law professor at the University of Baltimore.To the Editor:It has been estimated that college tuition has risen 2.5 times faster than the rate of inflation over the past 30 years. There is a way to hold colleges accountable.If the Department of Education developed standards whereby any college that exceeded a specified rate of tuition increase over a certain period of time was refused government-backed loans for students attending, we would very quickly see costs reined in \u2014 far more quickly than any presidential oratory could achieve.HARLAN KOSSONPittsford, N.Y.Advertisement"}

Appropriately, that\u2019s the first of six oronyms \u2014 seven, if you count the wonderfully clever title \u2014 that anchor Frank Viva\u2019s new picture book, \u201cOutstanding in the Rain.\u201d With the playful visual and verbal economy that is a hallmark of Viva\u2019s work (he\u2019s also the author of \u201cYoung Frank, Architect,\u201d \u201cAlong a Long Road\u201d and \u201cA Long Way Away\u201d), it\u2019s one of those books that pulls grown-ups into its puzzles as surely as it does children.We see a young boy in a red cap standing with his mother near the train platform at Coney Island, holding a triple-scoop cone. \u201c \u2018Ice cream,\u2019 I say, my birthday surprise,\u201d he exclaims. The word \u201ccream\u201d is visible through a die-cut hole that offers a peek at the next page. Turn the page, and you can see that \u201ccream\u201d is actually part of the word \u201cscream\u201d on the right side of the next spread: \u201c \u2018Oh no!\u2019 I scream, with tears in my eyes.\u201d Now, the boy\u2019s treat has fallen to the ground, where a dog laps it up. On the lefthand page, the hole that had been around the word \u201ccream\u201d is now the boy\u2019s mouth, open in a scream, with two neat rows of teeth that a reader might recall \u2014 or have pointed out to her \u2014 were, in the previous two-page spread, the contoured metal brow on the front car of the D train that was pulling into the Coney Island station.Charming as it is, the story can\u2019t help being mostly a vehicle for the book\u2019s verbal and visual achievement, which is considerable. To add to the challenges Viva set himself, he uses only five colors: cream, dark brown, a matte cherry red, a bright turquoise and a mango-y yellow-orange. The result is a retro-futuristic mood perfect for the Coney Island setting, and it lends even more of a cool, urban aura to Viva\u2019s already beguiling figures, with their long, curvy lines and weird proportions (tiny, daintily shaped feet, extra-long arms, big heads, noses made of a single line, either sharply pointed or wide and bulbous).At the moment, Viva\u2019s style will be familiar to alert New Yorkers who ride the subway, where he\u2019s designed the latest official M.T.A. Arts for Transit poster. It\u2019s a long scroll featuring sinuous, gorgeously odd-looking subway riders of all ages and from all walks of life. In the poster, as in \u201cOutstanding in the Rain,\u201d Viva conveys a kind of humane sophistication, inviting us to see the unity in people and things that are, on one level, completely and totally different \u2014 and to have some smart, jazzy fun at the same time.OUTSTANDING IN THE RAINWritten and illustrated by Frank Viva24 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $18.

{"Headline": "\u2018Shame and the Captives\u2019 and \u2018The Evening Chorus\u2019", "Date": "2015-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe dislocations of wartime come in many forms. A major military conflict can destroy cities, ruin economies and inflict calamity and hardship on entire populations. But it can also cause subtler, more personal derangements, and it\u2019s these that are the subject of two new novels, each tracing the complex \u201carithmetic of war\u201d as it plays out for individuals living far from the wholesale chaos of the front lines. \u201cShame and the Captives,\u201d by Thomas Keneally, and \u201cThe Evening Chorus,\u201d by Helen Humphreys, both tell stories of far-flung P.O.W. camps during World War II, but in each case the principal focus is less on the prisoners themselves than on those living on the other side of the barbed wire.Keneally, the Australian author of 30 novels (\u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d may be the best known), bases his book on a real-life incident from 1944: the so-called Cowra breakout, a bloody uprising of Japanese prisoners at a detention camp in a remote part of New South Wales. In an author\u2019s note, he is careful to point out that what he has written isn\u2019t a fictional retelling of that event but a \u201cparallel account\u201d \u2014 \u201ca sibling version,\u201d as he puts it, \u201crelated strongly by DNA, and the same in many regards, but in others bearing different names and features.\u201d The disclaimer is important because Keneally delves into the psychology of identifiable historical figures like the camp commandant and the officer in charge of the prison\u2019s mutinous Compound C. In the novel they bear invented names (as does the camp, here called Gawell), providing Keneally with the leeway he needs to give these characters novel-worthy depth.He also makes an attempt to fathom the motivations of the Japanese prisoners who instigate the suicidal uprising, in which hundreds of internees armed with baseball bats and makeshift knives swarm over the camp\u2019s perimeter fences, right into the enfilade fire of two machine guns. Keneally attributes this seemingly irrational behavior to a warrior mind-set that viewed being captured alive as an unforgivable disgrace. The prisoners intentionally seek to end the \u201cchronic disorder\u201d of their survival because there is no other denouement that would leave them with some shred of honor \u2014 a plausible explanation in the abstract, perhaps, but one that never seems entirely convincing.Keneally is on firmer ground when he unpacks the inner lives of his fellow Australians, in particular Alice Herman, a young woman living with her father-in-law on a lonely farm near the prison camp. Alice\u2019s husband, Neville, whom she barely knew before he was shipped off for service in Egypt, is now himself a P.O.W. in Austria; after two and a half years of absence, he is \u201cmore a story than a man\u201d to his wife. Her doubts about their hasty marriage intensify with the arrival on the farm of Giancarlo Molisano, an Italian prisoner from the Gawell camp who is commandeered to help with the sheep and wheat. Keneally is especially good at rendering the small psychological adjustments made between people embarking on intimacy, and the growing attraction between Alice and \u201cJohnny\u201d seems entirely believable, if doomed. These are two people who really know very little about each other, and even less about the world the other comes from. The inevitable conflict between them \u2014 like the uprising at the prison camp \u2014 manifests itself as a kind of cultural dissonance. At root, it\u2019s a misunderstanding, the result of an imposed proximity of unlike peoples during times of war. Enemies, it seems, can be scorned or embraced, but never truly comprehended.Imprisonment, too, is a decidedly more affirmative condition in \u201cThe Evening Chorus.\u201d For James Hunter, the young British pilot shot down on the novel\u2019s first page, incarceration in a Bavarian P.O.W. camp proves to be anything but an undesired suspension of life. An avid birder, James uses his idle time (officers are not required to work in the camp) as an opportunity to study a family of redstarts nesting just beyond the prison fence. He observes them for hours on end, stopping only for roll calls and meals, keeping close track of their behavior. Paradoxically, being a prisoner gives him an unexpected chance to engage with life. (Before the war, Humphreys notes, James \u201cdidn\u2019t have much time to watch the world. He was too busy moving through it.\u201d)James\u2019s wife, Rose \u2014 left behind in the couple\u2019s cottage in the Ashdown Forest of East Sussex \u2014 finds her wartime predicament similarly rejuvenating. The temporary disruption of her marriage has revealed its wobbly foundations, and she has begun an affair with Toby Halliday, an airman stationed in a nearby village. But guilt isn\u2019t the dominant emotion she feels: \u201cShe can\u2019t remember being this much in love with James. .\u2008.\u2008. Mostly what Rose wants in this moment is simply to kiss Toby again, to brush her hand across his face, to nestle into the hollow between his neck and collarbone.\u201dThis romantic idyll becomes a little problematic when James\u2019s sister, Enid, appears at the cottage after her London flat is destroyed in an air raid. Harboring a secret of her own (her married lover, who was also her boss, died in her bed during the bombing), she too finds solace in her mandatory exile. In one of the tidier parallels in this somewhat overschematic novel, Enid, like her brother, renews her hold on life by observing nature. She spends most of her time out in the Ashdown Forest (which, despite its name, is a nearly treeless heath), cataloging its flowers and ferns in a little notebook. In both novels, the end of the war marks the return to a less heightened state of being, undisturbed by danger and disorder and therefore less alive with unforeseen possibility. \u201cWho would have thought,\u201d Humphreys writes of Rose near the end of her book, \u201cthat she would long for the war years, that they would be the height of happiness?\u201d For these characters, peacetime means the end of a freer existence, an unwanted return to earth. As a morose James Hunter concludes in a letter written after his release, the most astonishing thing about birds \u201cis not that they fly, but that they touch down.\u201dSHAME AND THE CAPTIVESBy Thomas Keneally367 pp. Atria Books. $26.THE EVENING CHORUSBy Helen Humphreys294 pp. Mariner Books/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

{"Headline": "Nokia Agrees to $16.6 Billion Takeover of Alcatel-Lucent", "Date": "2015-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The Finnish telecommunications company Nokia said on Wednesday that it had agreed to an all-stock deal to acquire Alcatel-Lucent that valued its French rival at about $16.6 billion.The combined company is expected to become the world\u2019s second-largest telecom equipment manufacturer, behind Ericsson of Sweden, with global revenues totaling $27 billion and operations spread across Asia, Europe and North America.The companies are betting that, by joining forces, they can better compete against Chinese and European rivals bidding to provide telecom hardware and software to the world\u2019s largest carriers, including AT&T and Verizon in the United States, Vodafone and Orange in Europe, and SoftBank in Japan.Nokia said that it had offered 0.55 of a new share for each Alcatel-Lucent share, roughly a one-third premium to the company\u2019s stock price before the news of a potential deal was first announced.Nokia\u2019s chief executive, Rajeev Suri, would run the combined company, which expects the restructuring to save about $1 billion a year starting in 2019.\u201cTogether, Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia intend to lead in next-generation network technology and services,\u201d Mr. Suri said. \u201cWe will have a strong presence in every part of the world, including leading positions in the United States and China.\u201dIn midafternoon trading in Europe, shares of Nokia rose 3.3 percent, while shares of Alcatel-Lucent fell 12.3 percent.The deal is expected to be completed in the first half of next year, with Nokia shareholders owning 66.5 percent of the telecom giant and Alcatel-Lucent investors holding the rest.Despite the global popularity of smartphones and widespread Internet access, companies like Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent, which provide much of the equipment underpinning high-speed networks, have struggled to remain profitable.Faced with a gradual slowdown in how much global carriers are spending to upgrade their cellphone and broadband networks, telecom manufacturers have been forced to consolidate, slash jobs and restructure their operations to bolster profitability.After joining Nokia in the mid-1990s, Mr. Suri, an Indian citizen, successfully overhauled the company\u2019s telecom equipment unit by cutting costs and laying off thousands of employees.Analysts say that Nokia has progressively focused on its equipment unit, which now represents roughly 85 percent of the company\u2019s annual revenue. On Wednesday, Nokia confirmed that it had put its digital maps business \u2014 a competitor for Google Maps \u2014 up for sale. The division provides less than 5 percent of the company\u2019s yearly sales.For Alcatel-Lucent, itself a product of a struggling merger in 2006 between Alcatel of France and Lucent Technologies of the United States, Nokia\u2019s offer follows an attempt at restructuring its own operations, announced in 2013, which involved 10,000 job cuts.This week, French unions expressed concerns that Nokia\u2019s takeover would lead to significant layoffs in the country.To assuage concerns, both Mr. Suri and Michel Combes, the current Alcatel-Lucent chief executive, met with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Tuesday. France\u2019s Economy Ministry also has indicated that it might support the merger.The French government has frequently intervened to block or alter such deals in line with its industrial policy. But Mr. Hollande took a conciliatory approach in the meeting with the two companies\u2019 chief executives, welcoming a combination that would allow the creation of a European champion to fend off competition from China. (The observation seemed to overlook the fact that the market\u2019s global leader is already European: Ericsson.)It set as its conditions that French jobs be safeguarded and that Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s French research and development activities remain strong.\u201cOur goal is to continue to create value and jobs in France in the context of a global champion,\u201d Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron told the French daily Les Echos, in an interview published on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of corporations to evolve. My goal is that in a few years Nokia will decide it wants to become French.\u201dMr. Macron\u2019s relatively warm welcome contrasts markedly with the hostile response his predecessor, Arnaud Montebourg, gave to Yahoo\u2019s interest in the video website Dailymotion in 2013 and to General Electric\u2019s bid last year for Alstom, the French industrial champion that makes power equipment and TGV trains.Yahoo walked away from Dailymotion, depriving the French company of a big-pocketed investor, while G.E. eventually won Alstom, but only after significantly altering the structure of the deal and bringing in the state itself as an investor.Part of the explanation for Mr. Macron\u2019s greater receptivity is probably that he is an investment banker by training, while Mr. Montebourg is a standard-bearer of the left wing of Mr. Hollande\u2019s Socialist Party.But French officials often act as the public face of the technocratic elite who actually run the government ministries. The embrace of Nokia shows the technocrats\u2019 recognition that Alcatel-Lucent needed outside help: The company has lurched from one crisis to the next since its formation, shedding jobs and losing its competitive power in a rapidly evolving market. Its prospects for the future could portend more of the same.Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s problems had long been a cause of concern for the government, and Mr. Macron last year had even raised the possibility of some kind of deal with Samsung. \u201cNokia was the better deal,\u201d he said in the interview with Les Echos.Whether combining it with another also-ran with big dreams will result in the creation of a global champion remains to be seen.Analysts voiced doubts about whether Nokia would be able to significantly reduce its operations in France.\u201cThe French government won\u2019t want Nokia to cut jobs in France,\u201d said Neil Campling, an analyst at Aviate Global in London. \u201cFor this to work, there has to be significant job cuts. I\u2019m skeptical about how this will play out.\u201dMark Scott reported from London, and David Jolly from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Politico to Expand Coverage of States, Starting With New Jersey", "Date": "2015-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitico, the political website that started in Washington, is expanding its coverage of states, beginning with New Jersey and Florida.Capital, a New York-based publication owned by the company and focused on state politics and the media, will be renamed Politico. Its senior staff \u2014 Josh Benson, Katherine Lehr and Tom McGeveran \u2014 will oversee the expansion into the states, Jim VandeHei, a Politico founder, said in a staff memorandum on Wednesday. This year, the memo said, Politico will start a bureau in Trenton, which will offer \u201ca mix of free and paid content for the state written by reporters with expertise and experience.\u201d Shortly after that, the company will hire a team of political and policy writers in Tallahassee, Fla. Additional sites will follow.The aim, Mr. VandeHei said, is to \u201cfind a template for saving coverage of state government.\u201dLast November, Republicans posted sweeping gains in state houses across the nation, taking control of 29 legislatures, the most in nearly 100 years. Republican governors are in office in 31 states, the most since 1998. The party hailed the election victories as an endorsement of an agenda that included reducing the power of unions, and fighting President Obama\u2019s health care plan.\u201cIf you go into some states there is almost nothing, almost nobody paying attention,\u201d Mr. VandeHei said in an interview. Though robust coverage of states is crucial at any time, he said, noting that many have vast economies, it is particularly important \u201cwhen you fall into these periods where there is a lot of Washington inaction.\u201d The states are now incubators for policies, on topics like energy and transportation, which eventually are folded into national solutions, he said.The Politico model is to get half of the necessary revenue to sustain small newsrooms from higher-priced subscriptions aimed at a smaller group of insiders obsessed with politics and policy, and the other half from advertising and events, Mr. VandeHei said. \u201cNo matter where we go, if you\u2019re working in government, you need the same kinds of information,\u201d he said. And there is little competition, he said.\u201cThis could step in and fill a void left by daily newspapers,\u201d said James O\u2019Shea, a former editor in chief of The Los Angeles Times who has tracked the issue of local coverage for some time. It could even inspire newspapers to restaff their statehouse operations, he said.In the staff memo, Mr. VandeHei said Politico would also centralize its coverage of the media across New York and Washington, seeking \u201cmore stories that pop nationally.\u201dThe company announced nearly a dozen hires for its European operation, including Matthew Karnitschnig, chief Europe correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, and Ma\u00efa de la Baume, a Paris-based reporter for The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Waving Cash, Putin Sows E.U. Divisions in an Effort to Break Sanctions", "Date": "2015-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Mr. Putin was all smiles recently when he received Cyprus\u2019s president, Nicos Anastasiades, in Moscow. He hailed relations with the Mediterranean nation as \u201calways being truly friendly and mutually beneficial\u201d and agreed to extend \u2014 on greatly improved terms for Cyprus \u2014 a $2.5 billion Russian loan.Mr. Putin has methodically targeted, through charm, cash, and the fanning of historical and ideological embers, the European Union\u2019s weakest links in a campaign to assert influence in some of Europe\u2019s most troubled corners. One clear goal is to break fragile Western unity over the conflict in Ukraine.On Wednesday, Greece\u2019s new left-wing prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, will be the next to visit Moscow. Ahead of the trip, Mr. Tsipras declared himself opposed to sanctions on Russia, describing them as a \u201cdead-end policy.\u201dOn Sunday, Mr. Putin\u2019s efforts to peel away supporters from the European Union opened a new rift, after the United States ambassador in Prague criticized a decision by the president of the Czech Republic, Milos Zeman, to attend a military parade in Moscow on May 9. And in February, Mr. Putin visited Hungary, the European Union\u2019s autocratic backslider, peddling economic deals.Russia has so far been unable to turn such hand-holding into something more concrete against sanctions that require the approval of all 28 European Union members. But pressure for a rupture is building.Speaking in an interview last week here in Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, Mr. Anastasiades said Cyprus had grave doubts about Europe\u2019s policy toward Russia and was part of a \u201cgroup of member states who have the same reservations.\u201dHe ruled out breaking ranks with what for the moment remains a consensus in favor of keeping up economic pressure on Russia. But he said he expected a unanimous vote in favor of lifting sanctions when they come up for review this summer.He said he was convinced that Mr. Putin \u201crealizes the consequences of further military involvement\u201d in Ukraine and \u201cmeans business\u201d in putting in place a cease-fire agreement reached in February.The cracks opening up in Europe\u2019s policy toward Russia have presented a difficult problem for Donald Tusk, the former prime minister of Poland who is now president of the European Council, a body in Brussels that represents the European Union\u2019s 28 leaders.\u201cTo keep Europe united is today the biggest challenge,\u201d Mr. Tusk said last month, referring to \u201cthe very fragile and difficult consensus\u201d reached by European countries after Moscow seized Crimea in March last year.Moscow\u2019s skill at prying open fissures in European unity has been on display in Cyprus, a tiny nation that, because of its tight historical, religious and economic ties with Russia, has taken on an oversize role as a pivotal player in the geopolitical struggle set off by the conflict in Ukraine.Tugged in different directions by outside powers, Cyprus hosts British military bases and vast eavesdropping facilities, allows the United States Navy to use its ports and has been a member of the European Union since 2004.Yet it still looks to Russia as a vitally important diplomatic protector, particularly in relation to Turkey\u2019s military occupation of the north of the country, and as a crucial source of business for its financial services industry, still a pillar of the economy despite the 2013 meltdown.An agreement sealed during Mr. Anastasiades\u2019s visit to Moscow allows Russian warships to dock in Limassol, which is Cyprus\u2019s commercial hub and heavily dependent on wealthy Russians who want to set up shell companies to shuffle their assets overseas.Mr. Anastasiades insisted that military accords signed in Moscow merely extended a 1996 agreement and were \u201cnothing new.\u201d The terms of the agreements, however, are all secret, so it is impossible to know what Russia managed to gain.Mr. Anastasiades, who traveled to Moscow after recovering from heart surgery in New York, denied tilting away from the West toward Russia. As the leader of a small country, divided since a Turkish invasion in 1974 and situated on a fault line between East and West, Mr. Anastasiades said he sought good relations with all sides and \u201ceven with the devil.\u201d He added, \u201cI do not have the luxury to choose my friends.\u201dHe said Russia might also get a role in the search for and development of gas reserves off the coast of Cyprus, a venture until now monopolized by Western companies.Russia\u2019s ambassador to Cyprus, Stanislav Osadchi, told a Russian-language newspaper, one of several in Limassol serving the town\u2019s large Russian-speaking population, that Mr. Anastasiades\u2019s meeting with Mr. Putin \u201cdemonstrated that, despite attempts to isolate Russia and revive the Cold War, there are countries that do not want this.\u201dThe Russian Embassy in Nicosia reacted with fury last year when Makarios Drousiotis, a part-time historian and presidential adviser, published a diplomatic history that detailed Russian duplicity in its relations with Cyprus. The embassy denounced the book as \u201cpolitically unacceptable\u201d and criticized Mr. Drousiotis, who lost his job as an adviser to Mr. Anastasiades.The Twitter posts set off an uproar, prompting the United States ambassador to issue a contrite statement that his comments had been \u201cmisunderstood.\u201d\u201cFor lots of people on this island, Russia is seen as a savior,\u201d said Harry Tzimitras, director of PRIO Cyprus Center, a Norwegian-funded research group in Nicosia. This, he added, provides fertile ground for efforts by Moscow to \u201cinfiltrate the European Union\u201d and \u201cshow that it can disrupt certain policies\u201d promoted by Washington and Brussels.Vasilis Zertalis, the head of Prospectacy, a financial service company, described Cyprus as a \u201csmall piece on a big chessboard.\u201d Europe, he said, tried to advance its own position during the 2013 banking crisis by seeking to end Cyprus\u2019s role as a haven for Russian money.\u201cThey wanted to scare the Russians away,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the money that left was from Britain, from other European countries and from America.\u201dOrdinary Cypriots and politicians, he said, \u201call gave up on the European Union\u201d because of the harsh bailout terms in 2013 and \u201cknow that the United States will never take a stand against Turkey.\u201d\u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201cthe only allies Cyprus really has are Russia and maybe China.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the year Cyprus became a member of the European Union.

{"Headline": "Obama Rejects Republican Bid to Overturn New Union Rules", "Date": "2015-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Obama rejected a resolution passed by both houses of Congress that would have reversed rules to speed up and streamline union elections, the equivalent of a veto. Republicans referred to it as the \u201cambush election\u201d rule and argued that it would be unfair to businesses.The showdown over the labor rules represented a new front in the larger battle between Mr. Obama and the Republican-controlled Congress over the scope of his executive power. With the two sides at loggerheads over most legislation, they have been fighting instead over how far Mr. Obama can and should go in using his authority as president to advance his agenda.The union regulations, issued in December and scheduled to take effect on April 14, reflect the kind of policy changes Mr. Obama\u2019s team can enact through the various agencies of the executive branch. The president has also relied on his own power to make it possible for millions of illegal immigrants to stay in the country, to modify details of his signature health care program and to advance limits on power plant emissions blamed for climate change.The new rules outlined by the National Labor Relations Board would simplify the process of holding elections on whether workers want to form a union by allowing electronic filing of documents, reconciling procedures across the country and consolidating appeals to the board into a single process.As a result, unions would be able to hold elections in as little as 11 days, compared with an average of 38 days currently, according to critics. Employers would also be required to provide unions with personal contact information even for workers who do not want to join.\u201cThe N.L.R.B.\u2019s ambush election rule is an assault on the rights and privacy protections of American workers,\u201d the House speaker, John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, said in a statement after Mr. Obama\u2019s action. \u201cWith his veto, the president has once again put the interests of his political allies ahead of the small-business owners and hard-working Americans who create jobs and build a stronger economy.\u201dHe also announced that he would host a meeting on American workers at the White House this fall to explore ways of helping not only the wealthiest who have done well in the current economic recovery but also the middle-income Americans. Republicans tried to block the new N.L.R.B. regulations through the little-used Congressional Review Act, in which the two houses may pass a resolution disapproving rules by an executive agency. The Senate passed such a resolution in March by a vote of 53 to 46, and the House approved it 232 to 186 \u2014 votes mostly along party lines. Because the measure is a joint resolution rather than a normal bill, Mr. Obama signed what is called a memorandum of disapproval, which has the same effect as a veto. Based on votes in March, Republican critics do not have enough support to muster a two-thirds vote to override.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a federal board overseeing labor relations. It is the National Labor Relations Board, not the National Labor Review Board.Advertisement"}
