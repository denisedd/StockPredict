Caporella,  who is the company\u2019s biggest shareholder, said in a news release. \u201cNegligence nor mismanagement nor woeful acts of God were not the reasons\u2014much of this was the result of injustice!\u201d The Fort Lauderdale, Fla., company\u2019s revenue was $220.9 million in the three months ended Jan. 26., down about 3% from a year ago and sharply below the nearly $300 million it booked in the July-ended quarter. Profit fell 39% from a year ago. After years of explosive growth, sales of LaCroix have slowed in recent months as the seltzer has faced increased competition and questions about its ingredients. Overall, U.S. seltzer sales continue to climb as Americans shift away from sodas and sugary drinks. Beverage giants including\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            PepsiCo\n Inc.,\n\n\n      Coca-Cola Co. and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Nestl\u00e9\n SA\n\n\n      have expanded their lineups with drinks that challenge LaCroix, the U.S. market leader in flavored seltzer. And because National Beverage doesn\u2019t have direct-store delivery, the smaller company can\u2019t reach many of the convenience stores its bigger competitors do. Guggenheim analyst Laurent Grandet said LaCroix\u2019s biggest challenge is the rising competition, especially as PepsiCo invests in Bubly and Coca-Cola promotes Topo Chico, a seltzer brand it acquired in 2017. That competition will likely prevent LaCroix from regaining its lost market share, he wrote in a report Friday, recommending that investors sell their National Beverage shares. LaCroix\u2019s share of the U.S. flavored seltzer market has fallen 5 percentage points in the past year to 18%, while Bubly\u2019s has surged to 8% since its launch last year, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of Nielsen data. National Beverage\u2019s latest results, released Thursday evening, fell short of Wall Street\u2019s forecasts. Shares fell 15% to $58.27 Friday and are down more than 40% from September. As LaCroix\u2019s popularity has grown, so has curiosity about what is inside its bright, multicolored cans. The company has cultivated an aura of mystery around the drinks, saying the flavors are derived from \u201cnatural essence oils.\u201d In October, a class-action lawsuit was filed against National Beverage alleging its all-natural product claims were false and LaCroix contains synthetic ingredients. The company has denied the allegations as \u201cshameless fabrications\u201d and said independent lab testing it commissioned supported its natural product claims. The seltzer company in November said that key retailers had temporarily reduced in-store LaCroix displays as a result of the lawsuit. Starting in the third quarter last year, LaCroix increased its prices while PepsiCo pushed price promotions for Bubly. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty difficult combination,\u201d said Duane Stanford, executive editor of industry trade publication Beverage Digest. Making matters worse was National Beverage\u2019s response to the lawsuit, consisting of oddly worded news releases from the company\u2019s eccentric leader, Mr. Stanford said.  Last month, Mr. Caporella wrote in a news release that \u201cprofessional liars\u201d were using social media \u201cto falsely attack our brand integrity.\u201d On Thursday, Mr. Caporella wrote: \u201cManaging a brand is not so different from caring for someone who becomes handicapped. Brands do not see or hear, so they are at the mercy of their owners or care providers who must preserve the dignity and special character that the brand exemplifies.\u201d   Anthony Vendetti,  an analyst at Maxim Group who has a \u201csell\u201d rating on the stock, said the recent sales decline was largely due to the negative publicity around the lawsuit. He cautioned in a research report Friday that although the claims may not have merit, they could continue to dampen sales in the current quarter. A spokesman for National Beverage didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. In the four weeks ended Feb. 23, LaCroix\u2019s U.S. retail sales slid 7%, according to Wells Fargo\u2019s analysis. Meanwhile, sales of flavored sparkling water sold by Nestl\u00e9, which has added new flavors to its Perrier and Poland Spring brands, increased 11%.","1":"U.S. president cites substantial progress in trade negotiations  WASHINGTON\u2014President Trump said Sunday he would delay an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods set to take effect at the end of this week, citing \u201csubstantial progress\u201d on issues including intellectual property and technology transfer after a weekend of talks. In a tweet, Mr. Trump wrote that should progress continue, the U.S. would plan a summit with President Xi Jinping of China to \u201cconclude an agreement\u201d that would settle a yearlong trade fight between the two nations. Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets didn\u2019t specify how long the extension of a trade truce would last or any date for a potential summit. U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods had been scheduled to rise to 25% from 10% at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. In recent talks, Beijing offered to increase purchases of U.S. farm and energy products and services, ease restrictions on U.S. firms in financial services and auto manufacturing and improve protection of U.S. intellectual-property rights, according to people briefed on the discussions. But China\u2019s leadership sees all those measures as aligned with the nation\u2019s own interests. Beijing so far hasn\u2019t given much ground on issues it sees as crucial to maintaining the Communist Party\u2019s rule, including government subsidies and support to state-owned companies and other policies that underpin its state-led economic model. \u201cWe\u2019re taking steps to reform state-owned enterprises to make them more competitive, just not in the way the U.S. wants us to,\u201d a Chinese official said. The Chinese delegation is expected to leave Washington for Beijing on Monday afternoon. A statement by the official Xinhua News Agency echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets, saying negotiations were centered on putting together the text of an agreement and that \u201csubstantial progress\u201d has been made. Mr. Trump tweeted the progress involved \u201cintellectual property protection, technology transfer, agriculture, services, currency, and many other issues,\u201d without offering details. Previously, U.S. officials had said China had agreed to a currency accord. Beijing has recently tried to keep its currency from depreciating because of fears of capital flight. The two sides are working on a text that could top 100 pages, a person tracking the talks said. \u201cTrump has now substantially ratcheted up the pressure on his negotiators to strike a deal with China, even if it does little to assuage U.S. hard-liners\u2019 concerns about China\u2019s commitments on core structural issues,\u201d said Cornell University China expert Eswar Prasad. \u201cThere is still a yawning gap between the two sides on major issues due to U.S. lack of trust in China\u2019s commitments on structural issues and China\u2019s unwillingness to make any fundamental changes to its industrial and economic strategies.\u201d Divisions also remain on how to address U.S. complaints that Chinese authorities and companies pressure U.S. companies to share technology. Chinese officials deny that Beijing applies such pressure and argue that foreign firms voluntarily share technology in exchange for access to China\u2019s markets. U.S. semiconductor, chemical and auto firms, in particular, complain that Beijing has a variety of ways to obtain U.S. technology, including by joint-venture requirements and by regulatory panels that pass along U.S. technology secrets to Chinese firms. During the latest round of trade talks, said the people briefed on the matter, Chinese negotiators said Beijing was willing to better police practices on the local level and encourage U.S. businesses operating in China to report coercion to regulators. U.S. negotiators are pushing for much broader changes. \u201cIf extending the deadline leads the two governments to secure a sustaining bilateral deal that addresses American concerns about market access and structural reforms, then it will be worth it,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cBusiness wants a comprehensive deal that will reduce tensions and eliminate existing punitive tariffs.\u201d The two sides also haven\u2019t agreed how to enforce any deal. U.S. officials, who have for years complained about China\u2019s poor follow-up record, are pushing for provisions that would either permit Washington to reimpose tariffs on Chinese goods should Beijing fail to meet certain milestones\u2014called \u201csnapback\u201d in trade lingo\u2014or leave the levies in place and gradually remove them if Beijing meets agreed-upon yardsticks. Chinese officials have criticized that approach as unfair, and they said the two sides should jointly evaluate complaints.  Another issue: what standards should be used to judge compliance with an accord. If one or two U.S. firms continue to have intellectual-property problems in China, for instance, should that be sufficient to reimpose tariffs? If that isn\u2019t sufficient, what is? Hudson Institute China scholar Michael Pillsbury, who advises the Trump trade team, said the president hoped to get a negotiating edge by having a summit meeting in the U.S., rather than China. In past negotiations with the U.S., he said, China has reserved its most significant concessions for a final meeting with a U.S. president. But some in the White House worry that Mr. Trump will be so committed to getting a deal that he will settle for a weak agreement. Some Chinese officials said the U.S. underestimates the domestic political problems facing Beijing given the growing nationalist feeling at home.  The two sides are working off a lengthy list of U.S. demands on trade, delivered to Beijing last May, that includes cutting the bilateral trade imbalance by $200 billion in two years and halting subsides for advanced technologies. Many Chinese have compared those demands to the infamous \u201c21 Demands\u201d made by Japan in 1915 that would have greatly extended Japan\u2019s control of the Chinese economy during World War I. Mr. Trump has made cutting a trade deal with China a priority. His top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer,  has long taken a hard line on Chinese trade practices\u2014and in recent weeks has been cautioning about the big hurdles that remain before the two sides can strike a deal. Mr. Lighthizer has focused on so-called structural issues, including subsidies and technology transfer. Major stock indexes in Shanghai and Shenzhen each jumped more than 2% in early trading on Monday. The gains followed the signs of progress in trade talks, as well as comments from President Xi Jinping, reported in state media over the weekend, that finance should play a bigger role in the economy.

The holding, initially disclosed in an exchange filing, would be valued at about $437 million, based on the closing price of CICC\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares. It also has unlisted stock in mainland China. Tencent became a strategic investor in CICC in September 2017, buying a 4.95% stake. It and Alibaba, China\u2019s two most valuable technology companies, are fierce rivals in some areas.  Despite the tensions between Alibaba and Tencent, CICC has worked extensively with Alibaba and related companies. It was one of the banks that helped Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial Services Group raise $14 billion in private funding last year, and it worked on Alibaba\u2019s 2014 initial public offering. The Alibaba spokeswoman said the investment would strengthen a longtime partnership and help it better serve customers with innovative products and services.\u00a0A CICC spokeswoman said the bank is open to cooperating with technology leaders and would explore applying information technology in finance. CICC, a pioneer in Chinese finance, was once backed by\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Morgan Stanley\n            \n\n\n      and played a pivotal role in helping list many state-owned enterprises. It listed in Hong Kong in 2015, amid intensifying competition from newer competitors. The following year, it combined with a local brokerage in a deal that gave majority control to the state holding company Central Huijin Investment Ltd. Alibaba\u2019s affiliate Ant owns Alipay, a mobile-payment platform with more than 700 million users in China. Ant also runs the world\u2019s largest money-market fund and offers access to consumer loans and mutual funds. Tencent\u2019s WeChat, a messaging app with more than 1 billion users, also provides mobile payment services, microloans and wealth-management products. Fraser Howie, a former CICC banker and co-author of \u201cRed Capitalism,\u201d said Alibaba\u2019s investment might be primarily financial. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that Alibaba and Tencent have so much money, and CICC is a relatively high-quality asset,\u201d he said. In August, Alibaba bought 3.25% of another large Chinese brokerage, Huatai Securities, filings show. Last year CICC earned $458 million in investment banking fees for the Asia-Pacific region, ranking it 10th in the region, according to Refinitiv. On Tuesday, other regulatory filings showed that Singaporean sovereign-wealth fund GIC recently cut its stake in CICC, suggesting that Alibaba bought shares GIC sold. CICC shares closed at 16.92 Hong Kong dollars ($2.16) on Tuesday, compared with their 2015 initial public offering price of HK$10.28.","4":"Company also plans to boost number of developers to ramp up new content for its biggest videogame franchises  \nActivision Blizzard\n Inc.\n\n        ATVI 2.14%\n\n\n      said it plans to cut about 8% of its workforce as it grapples with changes in how people buy and play videogames. The cuts will eliminate around 775 people from Activision Blizzard\u2019s workforce of about 9,800. The company expects to record $150 million in pretax charges in connection with the moves, most of which will be incurred this year. The job cuts underscore the tough environment videogame makers face as players increasingly sink their time and money into only a handful of games they can play in perpetuity\u2014the current king being \u201cFortnite.\u201d The stakes are high: Players who aren\u2019t kept busy in one game might take their time\u2014and money\u2014to a rival. Activision Blizzard sounded that theme again Tuesday, telling analysts it plans to add to its developer team to produce content for existing franchises more quickly. As part of the restructuring, Activision Blizzard plans to boost its number of developers by about 20% in 2019 to ramp up new content for its biggest franchises, such as the shooter game \u201cCall of Duty\u201d.  Releasing new content has been a critical strategy for Epic Games Inc., the maker of \u201cFortnite.\u201d While the combat game\u2019s popular battle-royale mode is free, it is estimated to have made $2.4 billion in revenue from virtual goods since launching in September 2017, according to SuperData Research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Electronic Arts\n Inc.\n\n\n      on its earnings call last week blamed intense competition from \u201cFortnite\u201d and other games for turning in quarterly revenue below guidance.  On Activision Blizzard\u2019s call, analysts asked whether the company would consider making its shooter game \u201cOverwatch\u201d free, particularly after Electronic Arts launched a free battle-royale game last week called \u201cApex Legends.\u201d Operating chief Collister Johnson demurred, saying the company prefers to focus on creating compelling content.  Activision Blizzard\u2019s three main units\u2014Activision Publishing, Blizzard Entertainment and King\u2014operate with some autonomy, and the cuts are aimed at centralizing sales, marketing and other functions with the parent company. Shares rose 3.3% after hours, despite Activision Blizzard\u2019s softer-than-expected guidance for 2019. The stock has lost more than half its value since closing at $83.39 on Oct. 2, dragged lower as part of the broad tech selloff in the fall, and hammered again last week following earnings from rivals Electronic Arts and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Take-Two Interactive Software\n Inc.\n Activision Blizzard reported profit of $650 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with a loss of $584 million, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier, when the company took a hit from the new U.S. tax law. On an adjusted basis, Activision Blizzard earned 90 cents a share, ahead of the 84 cents expected by analysts, according to FactSet.  Revenue rose 17% to $2.38 billion. On an adjusted basis, revenue came to $2.84 billion, below the $3.04 billion analysts expected. \u201cWe didn\u2019t execute as well as we hoped to in 2018,\u201d Chief Executive Bobby Kotick told analysts, \u201cand our current outlook for 2019 falls below what is possible in an industry filled with growth opportunities.\u201d For the full year, the company projected adjusted earnings of $1.85 a share on $6.03 billion in revenue. Analysts had expected $2.34 a share on $7.45 billion in revenue. Exacerbating Activision Blizzard\u2019s woes is a thin slate of games for the coming year. The company\u2019s Blizzard Entertainment unit didn\u2019t announce release dates for any new games at its annual convention in November. \u201cWe\u2019re making changes to enable our development teams to create better content for our biggest franchises more quickly,\u201d Mr. Kotick told analysts. Activision Blizzard also plans to launch a new city-based league for \u201cCall of Duty,\u201d akin to its existing \u201cOverwatch\u201d league. In its latest quarter, the company said its number of monthly active users rose about 11 million to 356 million after declining for three consecutive quarters. Separately, several top executives have left Activision Blizzard in the past year, including Blizzard founder Mike Morhaime and the unit\u2019s finance chief, Amrita Ahuja. The parent company fired its finance chief, Spencer Neumann,  in early January after he was poached by Netflix Inc. for the same position.  On Tuesday the company said its board had approved a new program to buy back up to $1.5 billion of its stock over the next two years.","5":"Company also plans to boost number of developers to ramp up new content for its biggest videogame franchises Competitor BP added to the jubilant mood with a report that suggests crude will still be needed to meet the world\u2019s energy needs in the next two decades. ENI POSTS RISE IN SALES Italy\u2019s oil and gas juggernaut Eni SpA said Friday that earnings fell sharply in the fourth quarter, while sales and adjusted earnings rose, reports the Journal\u2019s Nathan Allen. The Italian oil major said quarterly net profit fell 76% to 499 million euros ($562 million) from EUR2.05 billion a year earlier. Eni attributed the disparity to gains of EUR2.7 billion booked in the year-earlier period on the sale of stakes in projects in Egypt and Mozambique. The firms adjusted operating profit for the quarter, which strips out the effects of these one-off gains, rose to EUR2.99 billion from EUR2.00 billion. Meanwhile, oil prices rose Friday, building on robust gains made throughout the week as a result of increasing signs of shrinking global crude supply. BP: RENEWABLES AND NATURAL GAS TO DOMINATE ENERGY GROWTH The vast majority of global energy supply growth is expected to come from renewables and natural gas over the next two decades, but steep investment in oil exploration and production will be needed to meet crude demand in 2040, according to BP. In its annual energy outlook report, the British oil-and-gas giant outlined as its central scenario a future in which renewable energy sources\u2014including wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and biofuels\u2014and natural gas will together account for 85% of the world\u2019s energy growth in the run up to 2040, writes the Journal\u2019s Christopher Alessi. PG&E\u2019S BANKRUPTCY SHOWS BLINDSPOTS IN GREEN INVESTING The bankruptcy filing by PG&E Corp. PCG is the latest stumble by a company rated highly by environmentally focused investors, further exposing a weakness in a scoring system meant to measure risk for shareholders, reports Rob Curran. The California utility\u2019s moves over the past 10 years to rely more on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar resulted in high scores on environmental, social and governance metrics, which are considered by many investors to be a positive factor in choosing a stock and used by others to manage risk. What the ratings couldn\u2019t predict is that the stock would lose nearly 70% of its market value since early November, as investors worried about potential liabilities for the role PG&E\u2019s equipment may have played in multiple wildfires. The company filed for bankruptcy protection on Jan. 29. CONGRESS MULLS CURBING PRESIDENTIAL TRADE AUTHORITY Appetite is growing in Congress to claw back authority from the executive branch and play a greater role in U.S. trade policy, just as the Trump administration resumed trade talks with China this week. Free-trade proponents in Congress have long felt uneasy about President Trump\u2019s steel tariffs, implemented last year under Section 232, part of the 1962 trade law that gives the president authority to impose levies if they are in the interest of national security, writes the WSJ\u2019s Joshua Jamerson. But a House of Representatives under Democratic control\u2014and Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley ascent on the Finance Committee\u2014is breathing new life into GOP-led efforts to check Mr. Trump and future presidents. Currently, Congress can pass a resolution of disapproval, voiding any tariffs, only when they relate to oil imports. BIG NUMBER: 10 MILLION Despite concerns about US-China trade issues weighing on broader risk sentiment, Jefferies is upbeat about key consumer China\u2019s oil demand, writes the Journal\u2019s Biman Mukherji. The firm notes that China\u2019s net crude imports in January exceeded 10 million barrels per day, for the third month in a row. Jefferies believes that the level of imports will be the new normal compared with 8.8 million barrels per day a year ago as demand for greater mobility rises.

His comments in the Oval Office followed four days of talks between U.S and Chinese negotiators, which Mr. Trump extended through the weekend. \u201cWe\u2019re having good talks, and there\u2019s a chance that something very exciting can happen,\u201d he said. Among the accomplishments that Mr. Trump cited was a pact with Beijing to curb currency manipulation, which Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called \u201cone of the strongest agreements ever on currency.\u201d But neither man nor Chinese Vice Premier Liu He provided any details of the deal. Similarly, none of the officials gathered in the Oval office offered any specifics to back up their assertions of progress. China hawks in the business community, the administration and in Congress say they are troubled by what they see as Mr. Trump\u2019s growing impatience for a deal, and are urging him to stand firm and insist China make fundamental changes in its industrial policies.  \u201cI am encouraged by signs of progress, but remain concerned that the president will accept a quick offer of procurement of U.S. goods rather than fundamental reforms to China\u2019s systemic problems,\u201d said Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., a New Jersey Democrat. People briefed on the specifics of the talks said the two sides still remained far apart on the major issues involved in the discussions: Chinese government pressure on U.S. companies to transfer their technology to Chinese partners; subsidies for Chinese state-owned firms; and protection of intellectual property. The two sides also remain deadlocked on how to enforce any agreement. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said progress was made on unspecified structural issues but cautioned that some \u201cbig\u201d hurdles remain before a deal is reached. \u201cIt\u2019s a little early for champagne,\u201d added Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.  Michael Wessel,  a commissioner of a congressional panel on China, who advises the Trump trade team, said that 2020 presidential politics were behind Mr. Trump\u2019s move to wrap up a deal. \u201cIt seems the Chinese have gotten the president to back down a bit,\u201d Mr. Wessel said. \u201cThey are probably going to address the most egregious public issues that might come up prior to the 2020 election and manage the relationship until then. The Chinese don\u2019t want to be an election issue either.\u201d The talks come as Mr. Trump must decide whether to extend a March 1 deadline for reaching an agreement, which would prevent 10% tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports from jumping to 25% at 12:01 a.m. the following day. Mr. Trump said he was amenable to an extension of \u201canother month or so or less.\u201d He also said he would \u201cprobably\u201d meet with Mr. Xi at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., sometime later next month. Over the weekend, said Hudson Institute China scholar Michael Pillsbury, the U.S. would press Chinese negotiators to be specific. \u201cThe White House hopes that the Chinese will actually agree to detailed descriptions of a meaningful agreement,\u201d he said. One concession cited by the administration is a Chinese pledge to purchase an additional 10 million metric tons of U.S.-grown soybeans. That quantity would represent nearly one-third of China\u2019s entire U.S. soybean imports in 2017, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics. Agency officials didn\u2019t immediately detail any time frame for China\u2019s newly agreed purchases. Mr. Trump floated the idea that talks could broaden to include Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei Technologies Co. and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ZTE\n Corp.\n\n\n      , which have faced significant U.S. scrutiny. The U.S. has pressured allies to shun Huawei over security issues and ordered the December arrest of Meng Wanzhou, its chief financial officer, for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. \u201cWe may or may not put that in the trade agreement,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding any decision would be made in conjunction with Attorney General William Barr. On the currency issue, people with knowledge of the negotiations say that Beijing has largely pledged to keep the yuan steady and not to engage in competitive devaluation to give Chinese exporters a leg up in foreign markets. That has been China\u2019s policy for some time. \u201cThe art of negotiating is to concede things you don\u2019t care for, while making a big hoopla about it,\u201d said Robin Brooks, chief economist at Washington-based Institute of International Finance, a trade association of big banks. \u201cAny promise by China to keep the yuan stable as part of a trade deal would be exactly this.\u201d It\u2019s also far from clear that any currency pledge made by Beijing would be enforceable through trade sanctions. A currency deal negotiated in the replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement, for instance, made such a pledge nonbinding. China\u2019s central bank maintains a tight control over the yuan despite years of promises to make the currency more market-driven. In the past year, it has sought to keep the yuan from falling too fast, for fears that too sharp of a depreciation could lead to excessive capital outflows, potentially destabilizing a financial system already struggling with rising debt woes. The prospective deal also reflects a growing divide between Mr. Trump and Mr. Lighthizer, say people familiar with the administration deliberations. During the past year, Mr. Lighthizer has successfully recommended to Mr. Trump that he impose tariffs on Chinese goods over the objections of Mr. Mnuchin. But after the stock market nose-dived late last fall, Mr. Trump\u2019s appetite for a tariff battle with China diminished, say administration officials. Recently, the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office has been making thank-you calls to those who appear on television or in the press calling for the administration to take a tougher stance on China. \u201cLighthizer had previously been getting his way by mastering the inside game,\u201d said Gene Sperling, a former senior economic official in the Clinton and Obama administrations, who has negotiated China trade deals. \u201cAs Trump gets more eager for any deal, he is now being forced to play an outside game to keep the pressure on.\u201d During the Oval Office session with his cabinet secretaries and Mr. Liu, the president cut off Mr. Lighthizer when he started to discuss the prospective trade deal as memoranda of understandings. \u201cI disagree,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cI think that a MOU is not a contract to the extent that we want.\u2026 To me, the final contract is really the thing, Bob. To me, MOUs don\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\u2033 Mr. Trump\u2019s language reflects criticism of MOU\u2019s Thursday night by Lou Dobbs, the Fox Business host who is influential with the president and his core supporters. \u201cAn MOU isn\u2019t worth the paper it\u2019s written on,\u201d Mr. Dobbs said.  \u201cTrump\u2019s words are coming out of Lou Dobbs\u2019 mouth last night,\u201d said a Trump adviser. \u201cIf you\u2019re 2020 campaign people, you want to protect Trump from an assault from the right.\u201d","7":"Investor concern rises over possible lower production levels and stricter industry oversight  Iron-ore prices jumped on Monday after the collapse of a dam owned by Brazilian mining company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Vale\n SA\n\n\n      killed more than 60 people, fueling speculation of lower supply ahead.  Futures in the ferrous metal jumped 5.8% to $78.87 a metric ton, as hundreds remained missing after the bursting of the Vale dam on Friday, which released mining waste and flooded the rural town of Brumadinho in the southeast Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. The incident caused analysts and investors to anticipate lower production of iron ore, the main ingredient in steel.  Shares of Vale, the world\u2019s largest producer of iron ore, tumbled 18% to $11.20 per American depositary share Monday. The company has suspended dividend payments and share buybacks, while freezing executive bonuses. It created committees to help victims and investigate the incident.  The disaster came less than four years after the failure of a dam jointly owned by Vale and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            BHP Group\n Ltd.\n\n\n      , also in Minas Gerais, killed 19 people and left hundreds homeless in one of the country\u2019s worst environmental disasters. While the dam that burst last week was relatively minor in terms of output, investors are pricing in the potential for stricter industry oversight going forward that would crimp supply, analysts said. \u201cThe market\u2019s always going to react,\u201d said Vivienne Lloyd,  senior analyst at Macquarie. \u201cThe probability of more stringent inspections and potential shutdown of other mines using similar methods has elevated since the disaster.\u201d The mine that collapsed accounts for about 7% of Vale\u2019s output, said Ms. Lloyd. Similar \u201cwet\u201d iron-ore operations comprise around half of all Vale operations, according to Macquarie.  Increased scrutiny on Vale\u2019s operations also could affect investor confidence in the company\u2019s stock. \u201cAlthough Vale\u2019s modest levels of debt should protect the company\u2019s solvency, we expect the aftermath of this incident will weigh on the equity for the foreseeable future,\u201d RBC analysts said in a note. Meanwhile, the incident may boost steel prices and support shares of Vale\u2019s competitors, other analysts say. \u201cWhile this is clearly a headline negative for steelmakers, they\u2019ll successfully pass on increased cost pressures to their customers in the coming weeks,\u201d said Seth Rosenfeld, equity analyst at Jefferies. The dam failure \u201cgives them an easy excuse to push up prices.\u201d The price gains in iron ore occur as analysts project slowing economic growth in China, the world\u2019s largest commodities consumer, to weigh on the demand and prices of commodities this year. For instance, copper futures have fallen nearly 20% from last year\u2019s high. Still, some analysts predicted iron-ore demand could rise in the second quarter.  Steel buyers around the world have been living hand to mouth and are reluctant to sit on supply amid relatively low prices in recent months, Mr. Rosenfeld said. As a result, he said many could move to replenish thin inventories before prices extend their climb.","8":"Audiences have more choices than ever before. For Hollywood, that might not be a good thing.  Hollywood studio Warner Bros. launched a research project last year, aiming to better understand where it fit in a chaotic entertainment landscape. The studio, which plans to roll out its own video streaming service this year, wanted to know just what the influx of entertainment options was doing to consumers\u2019 brains.  As it ran tests with audiences, a counter-intuitive pattern began to emerge. When presented with a dizzying array of hundreds of new movies and TV shows to watch, viewers tended to retreat to the programs that were most familiar to them.  It\u2019s an experience any Netflix user can identify with: Sitting down to pick out a movie, scrolling through choices for an hour--only to settle, finally, on an old episode of \u201cFriends.\u201d  Today, viewers have more choices than ever before, and for Hollywood studios, cable giants\u2014and even the streaming services that increasingly rule in entertainment\u2014that\u2019s a dangerous thing.  Just under 500 new TV series premiered last year--compared to 182 new shows in 2002, according to an annual report released by cable network FX. Netflix plans to release nearly 100 original movies and documentaries this year. Nearly three-quarters of U.S. households already have more than one streaming service like Netflix or Hulu, up from 59% two years ago, according to market-research firm Ampere Analysis; of these households, nearly 42% subscribe to three separate streaming services. And the two biggest Hollywood studios,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Walt Disney\n Co.\n\n\n      and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            AT&T\n Inc.\u2019s\n\n\n      Warner Bros., are preparing their own streaming services, set to launch by the end of this year.  Meanwhile, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to focus audiences\u2019 attention on the movies that Hollywood deems most important. On Sunday night, Hollywood will gather to honor the most prestigious movies of the year at the 91st Academy Awards. On Monday morning, executives in Hollywood will likely wake up yet again to the news that fewer people cared to tune in to their big night\u2014just as they did last year, when the telecast lost 6.4 million viewers, or about the population of Indiana. To succeed in a landscape of infinite choices, entertainment companies are faced with tough choices of their own.  Disney, which currently dominates the box office, is making a dramatic pivot. The biggest box-office titan of them all is tying its success in the next decade less to opening-weekend hauls in theaters and more to year-round subscription fees. Disney theatrical releases collected $3 billion in domestic grosses last year \u2014nearly $1.2 billion more than the next-highest studio. But the company\u2019s streaming service, Disney+, launching this year, \u201cremains our No. 1 priority,\u201d said Chief Executive Robert Iger on a conference call with analysts earlier this month.  The studio is pursuing a bifurcated strategy. It will keep opening its biggest movies, like its hits from Pixar Animation and Marvel Studios, in movie theaters, letting them run on the big screen before releasing them on Disney+. But some of its midsized movies will go straight to streaming: Executives have already moved some upcoming movies like \u201cNoelle,\u201d a comedy starring Anna Kendrick as the daughter of Santa Claus, from the theatrical slate to the streaming service.  The divided release strategy reflects a widespread change in people\u2019s viewing habits in recent years, with a growing concentration of box-office ticket sales going to the biggest releases. In 2018, three Disney movies\u2014\u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d and \u201cThe Incredibles 2\u201d\u2014accounted for nearly $2 billion of the year\u2019s $11.8 billion box office. All Disney movies shown on the big screen will eventually run on the streaming service as well, making the theatrical experience merely a precursor to the real goal: Subscription fees. \u201cYour theatrical release becomes a marketing tool for your streaming service,\u201d said Steve Mosko, CEO of Village Roadshow Entertainment Group, a film production and finance company that largely works on major releases like Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cReady Player One.\u201d Ultimately, Disney plans to run three separate video-streaming services, and has begun to pull Disney movies and shows from Netflix, to preserve them for Disney+. Disney already operates ESPN+, a sports streaming service, which it launched last April. A third streaming service, Hulu, will come under majority control at Disney after the studio completes a $71 billion deal to acquire major assets of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            21st Century Fox\n.\n\n\n      Hulu will likely host Fox programming that isn\u2019t as family-friendly as that of the Disney brand.  When researchers at Warner Bros. discovered that audiences seemed overwhelmed by too many choices, they had a guess at a diagnosis. Albert Einstein had called it \u201coption paralysis,\u201d indecision in the face of too many choices. (It\u2019s why Einstein opted to wear the same sport coat and trousers every day.) For advice, the studio brought in Barry Schwartz, an emeritus professor of psychology at Swarthmore College and the author of \u201cThe Paradox of Choice.\u201d  Striking a just-right balance--enough new choices to excite, but not too many to overwhelm\u2014will be crucial to studios getting into the streaming game, said Dr. Schwartz. If studios end up spending millions of dollars producing too much new programming, he said, they could end up in a situation where \u201cyou give people everything under the sun and they end up watching what they watched before.\u201d According to Dr. Schwartz\u2019s research, an influx of options also makes the ultimate choice more an expression of personal identity. When there are only five movies to choose from\u2014for instance, at a multiplex\u2014consumers do not put much stock in their decision, he said. But when there are 30 choices, it becomes a question of, \u201cAm I the kind of person who would watch this kind of movie?\u201d \u201cEven when you\u2019re sitting at home and no one knows what you\u2019re watching, the stakes go up, which just increases the paralysis because it\u2019s now a big deal,\u201d he said.   AT&T Inc., which bought Time Warner Inc. last year, already has a successful direct-to-consumer offering in HBO Go. The company is planning a three-tiered offering for the unnamed new service, one that starts with a basic movie offering and then adds original programming and children\u2019s programming as the price goes up. Like Disney, AT&T is planning to pull some Warner shows and movies from rivals like Netflix to boost its own offering. \u201cSome of the incumbents should expect that their libraries are going to become a lot thinner,\u201d said WarnerMedia chief John Stankey in November.  Netflix Inc. has been hugely successful at disrupting the ecosystem of the major movie and TV studios, but the coming threat from Disney and WarnerMedia has forced the company to spend even more money to try to maintain that dominance. It spent $12 billion on programming last year, and has shelled out out hundreds of millions of dollars for deals with top showrunners like Ryan Murphy, creator of \u201cGlee\u201d and \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d and Shonda Rhimes, creator of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d But the company isn\u2019t primarily worried about rival studios and cable giants. In a January letter to shareholders about its fourth-quarter earnings, Netflix wrote, \u201cWe compete with (and lose to) \u2018Fortnite\u2019 more than HBO,\u201d referring to the popular videogame.  \u201cThere are thousands of competitors in this highly fragmented market vying to entertain consumers and low barriers to entry for those great experiences,\u201d the letter noted. Chief Executive Reed Hastings has also cited sleep as one of the company\u2019s many rivals for viewers\u2019 attention and time.  Now, as it pursues top directors and audiences looking for \u201cevent movies,\u201d the company has started to turn more of its attention to the big screen\u2014an avenue of distribution that Netflix has mostly avoided in the past.  Major theater chains have shunned Netflix offerings, refusing to show high-profile releases like the Oscar-nominated \u201cRoma\u201d if it means supporting the company\u2019s insistence that the movies premiere on the service simultaneously or soon after.  But Netflix is making more overtures. The company, along with some other streaming services, have approached\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            IMAX\n Corp.\n\n\n      about releasing their movies in their large-format auditoriums, said IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond. Amazon Studios, the production arm of the e-commerce giant, is building a slate that combines theatrical releases with movies that premiere on its Prime Video streaming service.  Amazon spent nearly $50 million on distribution rights to four films at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, planning to give each of them a theatrical release. The company has had success with that model in the past, such as 2017\u2019s \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and 2016\u2019s \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d which won two Oscars. But the company has more recently experienced a number of duds like \u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d and \u201cSuspiria.\u201d  Once known for more independent fare, Amazon is building a slate of about a dozen films that will include awards prospects like \u201cThe Report,\u201d starring Annette Bening as California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and action-adventure features like \u201cThe Aeronauts,\u201d starring Eddie Redmayne as a scientist determined to hit record heights in a hot-air balloon.  To distinguish the original films that premiere on Prime Video, said Amazon Studios chief Jennifer Salke, the company will explore new ways to package them. One strategy: separating the films into subgenres like \u201csexy date night\u201d or horror features that customers will start to associate with Amazon.  The key: Making sure the selection is \u201cnot an endless scroll,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re programming for an audience. . . not in the volume game,\u201d said Ms. Salke.  Justin Guthrie, a 42-year-old videogame developer from Anaheim, Calif., at one point went to see movies three times a month. But he and his girlfriend, Belle Chuaypanya, have seen two in theaters in the past five months: \u201cHalloween\u201d and \u201cA Star Is Born.\u201d \u201cWe could have waited for those [to come on streaming], too,\u201d said Mr. Guthrie. Instead, the pair opt for Netflix and old episodes of \u201cThe Office\u201d or \u201cParks and Recreation.\u201d  After leaving a restaurant on a recent Saturday evening, Mr. Guthrie and Ms. Chuaypanya found themselves standing outside a movie theater, wondering what to do with the rest of their evening.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s playing,\u201d he said. And even though one of his recent movies\u2014\u201cA Star Is Born\u201d\u2014is nominated for eight Academy Awards, Mr. Guthrie has no plans to tune in on Sunday.  \u201cI used to,\u201d he said.   Corrections & Amplifications   \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d was nominated for eight Academy Awards. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said seven. In addition, Warner Bros. brought in Barry Schwartz, an emeritus professor of psychology at Swarthmore College and the author of \u201cThe Paradox of Choice,\u201d for advice. An earlier version of this article incorrectly gave his first name as Brian. (Feb. 25, 2019)","9":"Signs that the government may move to privatize the mortgage-finance giants have sent shares soaring  Some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest investors are sitting on a paper windfall this year as the government ratchets up a debate over the future of mortgage-finance giants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Fannie Mae\n\n        FNMA -0.75%\n\n\n      and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Freddie Mac\n.\n\n        FMCC -1.17%\n\n The increased rhetoric has so far led to a surge in the companies\u2019 shares and\u00a0paper profits for their investors, including mutual-fund giant Capital Group Cos. and hedge funds Discovery Capital Management LLC,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Blackstone Group\n\u2019s\n\n        BX 1.96%\n\n\n      GSO Capital Partners LP, Paulson & Co., Perry Capital and Pershing Square Capital Management LP, said people familiar with the matter. For more than a decade, lawmakers have tried and failed to overhaul Fannie and Freddie, which were placed in conservatorship during the 2008 financial crisis. But recent statements by administration officials indicating the government plans to move soon on taking the firms out of conservatorship have sent shares surging. The common shares of Fannie and Freddie are up more than 170% this year, while the most commonly traded class of the preferred shares, a form of senior equity that used to pay a dividend, are up more than 37%. Several of the funds own different classes of preferred shares. Pershing Square largely owns common shares. Hedge funds have been betting on Fannie and Freddie\u2019s privatization for years. They have pressed their case for much of that time with lawmakers, but have been buffeted by political and legal developments that have swung the companies\u2019 shares wildly.\u00a0The trade has run for such a long time\u2014a decade for some\u2014that some early investors in it are closing down or have dramatically different businesses now.

There is no guarantee a deal to end conservatorship will come to fruition. Repeated efforts to overhaul the firms\u00a0have\u00a0failed since the financial crisis\u00a0as the issue is politically fraught; a\u00a0change to the status of the firms could hurt the price and availability of mortgages for millions of Americans. But should a plan go forward, it would conclude the biggest unresolved legacy from the financial crisis\u2014what to do with the failed mortgage-finance companies\u2014and partly determine whether hedge funds wind up profiting from their wagers. \u201cIt\u2019s night and day,\u201d said David Barrosse of Washington, D.C., policy analysis firm Capstone LLC, of the change in political will to privatize Fannie and Freddie. \u201cWe think that the signs are there for anyone to see, in public statements: This is happening now.\u201d Fannie and Freddie are central players in the mortgage market, buying mortgages from lenders and packaging them for issuance as securities. The government effectively nationalized them in 2008 in a bid to stabilize the housing market as mortgage defaults mounted. In return for injecting about $190 billion into the firms, the government created a new class of stock\u2014senior preferred shares\u2014that paid an annual 10% dividend, along with warrants to acquire nearly 80% of the firms\u2019 common stock. The Treasury revamped its bailout agreement in 2012 to require nearly all\u00a0the firms\u2019 profits be swept away as dividend payments on those preferred shares. Investors filed suit over the change. Hedge funds, which largely own preferred shares, have been betting they will recoup on their preferreds something close to par, or 100 cents on the dollar. Some funds scooped up preferreds for cents on the dollar when the firms collapsed. Hedge funds have been pushing for the government to raise fresh capital for the companies and sell its stake on the market. That way, investors hope, they might be paid out. Hedge funds argue the firms\u2019 restructuring would bolster a slowing housing market and move liability from taxpayers to private shareholders. Fannie and Freddie have sent roughly $292 billion to the federal government since their bailouts in 2008. Investors point out that return relative to the amount of government aid the firms received far outstrips the $16 billion return on TARP, the federal bailout fund for banks during the crisis. Hedge funds could also benefit if lawsuits investors have filed related to the government\u2019s rewrite of the bailout terms are decided in their favor. To help their bet, fund managers and analysts have made regular visits to Treasury and Congress, kept investment staffers in Washington and hired specialist public relations firms. Several investors have close ties to senior Trump administration officials. John Paulson,  for example, invested inOneWest Bank, the lender rehabilitated by executives that included Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Joseph Otting,  acting chief of Fannie and Freddie\u2019s federal regulator. Mr. Mnuchin also invested in Mr. Paulson\u2019s hedge fund before he became Treasury secretary. A growing cadre of\u00a0investors who aren\u2019t suing the government, including Paulson and GSO, are behind a proposal by investment bank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Moelis\n            \n\n\n      & Co. that calls for allowing Fannie and Freddie\u00a0to recapitalize by ending the profit sweep and issuing new common and preferred stock. Moelis, which is advising some holders of Fannie and Freddie\u2019s preferred shares, estimates the government could make up to $125 billion through the sale of its warrants for the companies\u2019 common stock. Investors\u00a0peg the total face value of preferred shares\u00a0at more than $30 billion. A Trump administration plan to release the companies from government control is technically feasible, but analysts said it may be difficult to pull off partly because Congress would be unhappy that the administration was sidestepping it. Discovery, GSO and Perry are up on the trade overall, said people familiar with the firms."}}
