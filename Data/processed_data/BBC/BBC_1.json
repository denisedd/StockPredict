a minority, people that had never engaged with me before - who would just randomly swear at you or insult you as if that was somehow now normalised, acceptable, civil behaviour. Well it's not.\"There used to be a view that many things said on social media would never be said to your face, but it is now - and it's quite unpleasant, to the point of aggression.\"A number of politicians have voiced concerns about their safety in light of social media abuse. Tory MSP Annie Wells told the Mail on Sunday police had advised her to vary her route to work after receiving threats online.The Scottish Parliament said a total of \u00a340,000 has been spent on security modifications for MSPs offices in the last 12 months - such as metal shutters on shopfronts, intercoms, strengthened front doors and counters.And a further \u00a314,000 has been spent on lone worker safety devices over the last two years.Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said threatening messages online and violent acts offline were connected.She said: \"I think there's a compelling link between the prevalence of these threatening online tweets and then what you've seen in New Zealand, or on the streets of the UK with Jo Cox being murdered.\"Because what happens is, people go online, they say these things, they follow people who think like they do, they become more convinced of their own self-righteousness, they're encouraged to take it to the next level. \"That might be turning up at an office and saying out loud the things you say on the internet, and before you know it it turns into the violent extremist actions we've seen in New Zealand and the UK and right across the world.\"Ms Dugdale has called in the police about online death threats on three occasions during her eight years as an MSP, and says she has developed \"emotional body-armour\" over the years.However, she fears there is a \"great danger\" that online bullying could \"put off a whole generation of young people\" from participating in politics.This echoed comments made by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in 2018, when she said social media abuse makes her \"angry\" because \"I worry it is putting the next generation of young women off politics\".Ms Dugdale said: \"The benefit of social media is that it should open up your politicians to you, to make them more accessible. But if you have a culture like this, which encourages people to say exactly what they think using whatever language they want, then you're going to going to have politicians responding in a way where they become so thick skinned they lose the ability to feel, to be emotional, to have the kind of human response you'd expect them to.\"You have to put your guard up, to protect yourself from that, and years down the line I think we might regret forcing our politicians to lack so much emotion.\"Scottish Conservative MSP Rachael Hamilton - who has also had to report Twitter abuse to police - agreed that the tone of debate online was \"putting candidates off standing\" in elections.She is calling for a \"joint code of conduct\" to be agreed before the next Scottish Parliament election in 2021, so parties can agree on the need for a \"respectful dialogue\".Ms Hamilton said her experience with Twitter had improved since she learned how to block out abuse - using techniques MSPs have been sharing among themselves.She said: \"In general, now I've found the mute and block buttons that Ruth Davidson kindly introduced to me to, I've had a better experience on Twitter.\"Initially I was completely sick to the stomach. I was really upset by the whole thing. But genuinely, the techniques of dealing with it - so speaking to colleagues about it and knowing that it's not just me that's experiencing it - actually makes me feel a bit more reassured. I also find that using the mute and block buttons have worked brilliantly because I'm not exposed to it.\"Mr Mackay was also enlightened on the use of the block button by a Conservative MSP - underlining that while members may debate fiercely in the Holyrood chamber, they still work together outside of it.He said: \"It was actually a hardcore Unionist Tory MSP - Adam Tomkins of all people, so we're at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of constitutional politics - that showed me how to mute people. \"That works for me, because I take some satisfaction that people are shouting into cyberspace and I'm not even seeing any insults that they make any more. So I've got Adam Tomkins to thank for that.\"Twitter contends that it has \"strengthened\" its approach to abusive content, and is now acting on 10 times more abusive accounts.A spokeswoman said: \"Our priority is to improve the health of the public conversation. In 2018, we introduced more than 70 changes to product, policy and process to achieve a healthier, safer Twitter. \"We've expanded our safety policies, tightened enforcement, improved how we communicate with users, and invested in better technology to limit the spread and reach of abusive material. These actions have led to a drop in abuse reports, and we will continue building on this progress to ensure the safety of our users remains paramount.\"","1":"Glasgow City Council's \u00a3548m equal pay settlement could be financed by \"selling\" off its most-popular venues to an arm's-length company.A council report proposes transferring ownership to City Property Glasgow Investments LLP (CPGI) which would pay for them by taking out long-term loans.Venues such as the Riverside Museum and the Emirates Arena would then be leased back to the council.The cost of the lease would be designed to meet CPGI's loan repayments.In January, the council agreed in principle to settle the equal pay claims of thousands of women going back more than a decade.It has now published a report on how the council could finance the deal.City Property Glasgow Investments LLP (CPGI), the arms-length company, is wholly owned by Glasgow City Council.Council leader Susan Aitken said the sale and leaseback arrangement would \"release the potential\" of the property assets while keeping them in the city's ownership.The council added that users would not see any difference in how they access venues on a day-to-day basis. The paper will go before the council's City Administration committee on Thursday.Under proposals, the following venues would be transferred to the City Property portfolio:The paper before the council next week also looks at refinancing a previous loan taken out in 2010.Ms Aitken said: \"I've always been clear that, although settling equal pay has been about delivering justice for thousands of the women in our workforce, meeting the substantial cost of doing that must be fair for citizens.\"Releasing the potential of our property, while keeping it in the city's ownership, protects services and the future of these valued assets.\"The council's massive equal pay settlement arose from an earlier attempt to eliminate gender pay inequality. In 2006 Glasgow City Council adopted a job evaluation scheme with the aim of ensuring that men and women received equal pay for jobs of the same value.However, campaigners claimed workers in traditionally female-dominated roles such as catering or home care were paid up to \u00a33 an hour less than those in male-dominated jobs such as refuse workers or grave diggers.Ms Aitken said the previous Labour administration \"wussed out\" of doing anything about the problem for more than 10 years while her own minority SNP administration, elected in May 2017, had \"grasped the nettle\".She said: \"I'm delighted that we have agreement with the claimants and to be able to recommend to my colleagues a deal that finally delivers pay justice for thousands of women in our workforce.\"After a decade going round in circles in the courts, we have reached a fair settlement through 12 months of tough but open and honest negotiations.\"This report is our opportunity to put right a wrong that has damaged the council, its workforce and the city for too long.\"","2":"Lebanese factions have agreed to form a new government of national unity, ending nearly nine months of wrangling.\"We must turn the page and start working,\" said Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, who is now in his third term.The 30-member cabinet has four women, including the interior minister - a first for Lebanon.The most pressing challenge for the cabinet is to revive Lebanon's economic fortunes and cut the national debt, which stands at about 150% of GDP.Mr Hariri's reforms are expected to unlock nearly $11bn (\u00a38bn) in pledged international aid and loans. Lebanon is governed by a complex power-sharing system aimed at representing all of its religious and political communities.Mr Hariri's new government will be composed of most of the country's rival factions, including the Iran-backed Shia movement Hezbollah which - with its allies - made gains in parliamentary elections last May. One of the main sticking points until now has been how Hezbollah's Sunni allies, who oppose the prime minister, would be represented in government. They were eventually awarded one position in cabinet, while Hezbollah took two seats. Jamil Jabak was chosen as health minister by Hezbollah, although he is not a member of it.Other key members of the new cabinet are Ali Hassan Khalil and Gebran Bassil, who both remain as finance and foreign ministers respectively. Four women entered the government. Among them is Rhea al-Hasan, the country's new interior minister.Despite being 48 years old, Mr Hariri is seen as a veteran in Lebanese politics.In 2017, he caused a significant political crisis when he announced his resignation on a routine trip to Saudi Arabia in a televised address, saying he feared an assassination attempt. He suspended his own resignation two weeks later after speaking to President Michel Aoun back in Lebanon.He denied speculation that Saudi Arabia had forced him to leave as part of a regional power struggle with Iran, and instead accused coalition partner Hezbollah and Iran of spreading strife in the region.Mr Hariri's father Rafik al-Hariri was killed by a bomb in 2005. Four men believed to be linked to Hezbollah are being tried in absentia at a UN-backed tribunal in connection with the attack, though the group denies any involvement.The announcement of the new government ends months of uncertainty following elections more than eight months ago.Lebanon has long had a power-sharing political system between the different religious denominations. The number of seats in parliament is split between Christians and Muslims, and the president, prime minister, and speaker of the parliament must each come from a specific religious background.","3":"Council tax bills in England will increase by an average of 4.5% from April, reaching more than \u00a31,800 in some regions, research suggests.It is the second highest rise in a decade, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa) said.The Local Government Association said cuts had left councils \"little choice\".The government said they were \"responsible for managing their own resources.\"A survey of 312 councils by Cipfa found eight out of 10 will impose the maximum increase permitted.Local authorities in England are allowed to raise their council tax by 2.99%, plus a further 2% if they provide social care. Any that want to exceed this must hold a referendum.Cipfa said the annual Band D bill would rise by an average of \u00a375.60.The increase varies from an average of \u00a371 in London to \u00a386 in the north-east.Funding for the police makes up about a third of the increase, with police and crime commissioners permitted to double their precept from \u00a312 to \u00a324.In 2018-19 bills increased by an average of 5.1%, the largest rise for 10 years.The effect of the referendum cap meant that bills fell in real terms between 2011 and 2015 because they did not increase in line with inflation.Gloucestershire County Council was one of the authorities to approve the full 4.99% increase.The council plans to pump more money into children's services and adult social care, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.Lewisham in London, Birmingham City Council, North Yorkshire County Council and Kent County Council are among those where council tax will rise by 4.99%.Those not rising by the maximum include Cornwall (3.99%) and York, which voted for a 3.25% increase.Rob Whiteman, chief executive of Cipfa, said the increase was a reflection of the \"incredible\" financial pressures faced by local authorities and the police.\"Local authorities have faced the most significant cuts to spending over the last ten years,\" Mr Whiteman said.\"Despite the government's announcement that austerity is ending, for local authorities this is clearly not the case.\"Councillor Richard Watts from the Local Government Association said councils had lost \"60p out of every \u00a31\" the government had provided for services since 2010.\"Faced with such funding pressures, many councils feel they have little choice but to ask residents to pay more council tax again this year to help them try to protect their local services,\" he said. A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said: \"Councils, not central government, are responsible for managing their own resources.\"Taxpayers can veto excessive increases via a local referendum.\"The local referendum rule only applies in England. The National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament have the power to cap local authorities' council tax rises.In Cardiff, council leaders set an increase of 4.9% while Pembrokeshire saw a 9.92% rise and Conwy 9.6%.Taxpayers in Scotland will see bills rise up to 4.79%.Northern Ireland has a rates system instead of council tax.","4":"Scotland's councils have been urged to make \"fundamental changes\" to the way they deliver services due to rising demand and changes to funding.A new Accounts Commission report said councils \"face an increasingly complex, changing and uncertain environment\".The watchdog said local authorities must \"think differently about how they deliver and fund services\".The government recognised there were \"challenges\" for councils, but said it had treated them \"very fairly\".But opposition parties said the report underlined that local authorities need more cash and fund-raising powers.The latest Scottish budget debate at Holyrood was again dominated by disagreement over the funding being made available to local authorities.Opposition parties point to a real-terms reduction in the core revenue grant available to councils, while ministers contend that the overall package - including ring-fenced grants and other funding - has gone up.The Accounts Commission said funding had \"increased slightly\" between 2018-19 and 2019-20, but set this against a longer-term reduction of 6% in total revenue funding since 2013-14.And the report underlined that an increasing share of local authority funding is now tied to Scottish government priorities. This rose from 6.6% of revenue budgets in 2018-19 to 12.1% in 2019-20 - leaving councillors with \"less flexibility in where to spend and where to save\".This comes against a backdrop of an ageing population and rising demand for the services delivered by local government.While the government is planning new ways for them to raise revenues - including powers to levy a local \"tourism tax\" and another on workplace car parking - the Accounts Commission report noted that councils are already \"looking for other options to increase income\".They found that 11 different service charges had increased by more than the rate of inflation in recent years, highlighting a 20% increase in the cost of burial plots and a 12% rise in the cost of funeral services.However, the report concludes that current efforts \"are unlikely to be sufficient to address the growing gap between demand and resources, and more fundamental changes are needed\".The report reads: \"While councils have continued to find ways to manage funding gaps and have made good progress with medium-term financial planning, they face an increasingly complex, changing and uncertain time ahead. \"To continue to improve the outcomes for their communities within this context, councils need to be open to transformational change and implement new ways of working.\"Gail Macgregor, resources spokeswoman for local authority umbrella body Cosla, said the report \"clearly shows that councils have performed well and continued to deliver essential services for their communities over the last year despite the severe financial challenges that they face\".She added: \"Today's report also makes clear that difficult times and choices lie ahead - coupled with continuing pressure on our finances.\"Graham Sharp, chairman of the Accounts Commission, said: \"It's important to recognise that councils are working hard to maintain and, in some cases, improve services. \"Now fundamental change is needed to ensure services meet the shifting demands of local communities, with councils working and collaborating with communities to deliver the change needed. Councils must now focus on changing how front-line services are designed and delivered.\" A Scottish government spokesman said there were \"challenges\" for local government, but insisted that it had been treated \"very fairly\" in budget allocations.He said: \"Local authorities will receive \u00a311.2bn in 2019-20 through the local government finance settlement, a real terms increase in both revenue and capital funding which, together with actual council tax rises, provides an extra 5.6% in overall resources to support local services.\"We welcome the report's findings that local authority performance is largely improving or being maintained. We expect all councils to consider and take any necessary action to implement the report's recommendations to help meet future challenges and continue to improve outcomes.\"Scottish Conservative local government spokesman Alexander Stewart said the government \"cut council finances to the bone, then expects hard-working council tax payers to pick up the slack\".And Scottish Labour's finance spokesman James Kelly said the report \"exposes the brutal legacy of the SNP's cuts to council funding\".Green MSP Andy Wightman said it was \"essential that councils are better resourced and have more powers to fund services locally\", while Scottish Lib Dem local government spokesman councillor Peter Barrett said ministers must provide councils \"with the funding and economic levers necessary to properly tackle local priorities\".","5":"Ministers from Scotland and Wales are demanding clarity on where vital funding will come from after Brexit.Scotland's Finance Secretary Derek Mackay and Welsh Finance Minister Rebecca Evans have asked the UK government to explain replacements for EU cash streams post-Brexit.These include university research grants, rural community funding and public sector pensions.The two will later meet Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss in Cardiff.The Federation of Small Business has stressed the need to avoid no-deal Brexit and to have in place replacement arrangements for EU grants to make sure neither nation is disadvantaged as a result of Brexit.Mr Mackay said: \"Today's meeting is an opportunity for the UK government to provide much needed clarity around future funding as well as details on what support will be made available to help protect Scotland's economy against the consequences of the UK's exit from the European Union.\"Funding from the EU supports jobs in Scotland, from major infrastructure projects to sustaining rural communities and delivering research funding for our world-class universities. That is why the Scottish government is determined to defend its hard-won fiscal responsibility and maintain the benefits that EU funding has provided to many sectors and individuals in Scotland. \"With just weeks to go until the planned EU exit day, we remain deeply concerned about the lack of detail regarding replacement arrangements for EU funding streams given their importance to individuals, businesses and communities across Scotland.\"Mr Mackay will ask Ms Truss to provide reassurance Scotland should not be financially worse off as a result of EU exit and to guarantee that all lost EU funding will be replaced in full.He said that Brexit uncertainty was already impacting key economic indicators and a no-deal Brexit would lead to a major dislocation to the Scottish economy.He also said the UK government \"must immediately rule out the possibility of a 'no deal' Brexit and extend the Article 50 process\". But he added that as a responsible government, they would intensify work to prepare for all outcomes.Welsh Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said she would also push the UK administration for clarity about budgets.She said \"With the clock ticking as we approach EU exit day, it is absolutely vital we are at the heart of decision making and are able to prepare for the impact of Brexit.\"Alongside this, I will also be pressing for further clarity and assurances about the cost associated with the UK government's changes to public sector pensions and how it intends to fund it.\"Only last week, the First Minister and local government leaders wrote to the Chancellor seeking clarification. Worryingly, even as local authorities are finalising their budgets, there is still some uncertainty about funding.\"Colin Borland, director of devolved nations for the Federation of Small Business, said: \"Avoiding a no-deal Brexit at the end of March is the highest priority for smaller businesses. Elected members at every level need to push hard to avoid this outcome. \"But we would encourage local businesses from Aberystwyth to Aberdeen to check out official sources of advice to ensure they're as prepared as they can be for what could be an abrupt change in trading conditions.\"A \"no-deal\" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period.Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK will leave without a deal.This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up.The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself.Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border.The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty until their status was clarified. The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days.The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear.Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain.But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks.A Treasury spokeswoman told the BBC: \"We are working closely with the devolved administrations so they have the resources to prepare as we leave the European Union.\"This includes allocating \u00a355m to the Scottish government and over \u00a330m to the Welsh government to support Brexit preparations for all scenarios in 2019-20.\"","6":"The government of Mozambique has filed a case in the High Court in London against the investment bank Credit Suisse over what has become known as the \"tuna bond\" scandal.Credit Suisse was one of the lenders that helped to arrange $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) of government-backed loans that pushed Mozambique into a debt crisis. Also named in the filing are three former Credit Suisse bankers, who have already been indicted in the US. Credit Suisse declined to comment.The court records said the case related to \"commercial contracts\", but gave no further details.Mozambique's economy has been in crisis since 2016, when it emerged the country had more than $2bn of undisclosed state debts.The loans, taken out between 2013 and 2016, were marketed as investments in schemes including maritime security projects and a state tuna fishery. But a proportion of the money has not been accounted for and the allegations made in the US indictment include accusations of kickbacks and fraud.Manuel Chang, the former Mozambique finance minister who signed off on the loans, has been detained in South Africa since December on charges related to the loans scandal. He denies any wrongdoing.The court documents filed in London also mention Surjan Singh, Andrew Pearse and Detelina Subeva, former employees of Credit Suisse who are waiting to hear whether they will be extradited to face charges in the US. They are accused of conspiring to violate US anti-bribery law, as well as money-laundering and securities fraud, in an indictment issued by a US District Court in New York.","7":"France has reacted frostily to the Dutch government's sudden purchase of a stake in Air France-KLM in attempt to counter French influence.Shares in the airline company fell 11% after the Netherlands government said late on Tuesday it was acting to protect \"Dutch interests\".The Dutch bought a 14% stake, aiming to match France's 14.3% share.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire insisted the company should be \"managed without national public interference\".The Dutch move began late on Tuesday, with an initial acquisition of 12.7% of Air France-KLM shares.According to French reports, the government in Paris was informed of the Dutch move only an hour before a press conference on Tuesday night, and after the shares had been bought.A ministry source told AFP news agency the Dutch move was both \"surprising\" and \"unfriendly\", more in the manner of market traders than a state shareholder. The Dutch government then upped its stake on Wednesday to 14%.French President Emmanuel Macron said the Dutch government should \"clarify its intentions\".\"Buying this stake ensures we have a seat at the table,\" Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said of the initial move, which cost about \u20ac680m (\u00a3583m; $774m). By the end of Wednesday it had spent \u20ac774m.The justification, he said, was to protect Dutch economic interests and jobs - particularly regarding Amsterdam's Schiphol airport. Schiphol is Europe's third busiest airport after London Heathrow and Paris Charles de Gaulle. KLM is more profitable than its French counterpart and retains much public support for its reputation as the national carrier. The monarch of the Netherlands, King Willem-Alexander, even serves as a co-pilot on the company's planes on a regular basis to maintain his pilot's licence.There was widespread political support in the Netherlands for the secret share-purchase. Centre-right CDA leader Sybrand Buma said it was of \"great significance for a solid future for KLM\".Mr Hoekstra is expected to meet his French counterpart later in the week, which French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux predicted would be a \"frank but friendly, but especially frank\" discussion.Air France-KLM was formed out of a merger of the two national flag carriers in 2004 - though the airlines themselves have continued to operate under their own separate banners.Until now, the Netherlands held only a 6% stake in KLM - the smaller subsidiary - while France owns 14.3% of the parent company.The surprise move from the Dutch came after a series of disagreements in which the Dutch felt they did not have enough influence in the holding company, which was deciding strategy.Disagreements between the holding company and KLM management - mainly about the autonomy of the Dutch airline - have been made public in the past year.Strikes in France in 2018 caused company-wide losses, much to KLM's frustration. A Canadian CEO, Ben Smith, was appointed at the holding company and seen as trying to assert greater authority over the Dutch subsidiary.In recent weeks, reports emerged that the position of KLM's CEO Pieter Elbers could be under threat because of his vocal support for keeping the two operations separate.Last week, the group announced a \"goal of simplifying and improving the governance\", part of which involves increasing collaboration.French financial newspaper La Tribune characterised the sudden move by the Netherlands as a \"thunderbolt\" while Le Monde saw it as a \"stock market blitzkrieg\".The Air France-KLM board of directors was expected to meet on Wednesday to discuss the fallout.Delta Air Lines and China Eastern Airlines each hold a 8.8% stake in the company.","8":"Brussels has knocked down a proposed French-German rail merger, designed to help Europe compete with China.The EU's competition commission blocked the tie-up, saying uniting France's Alstom with the rail arm of Germany's Siemens would lead to higher prices.The firms had said the merger would create an industrial champion on a par with other global players.France's finance minister, Bruno Le Maire said the decision would \"serve the interests of China\".\"The Commission prohibited the merger because the companies were not willing to address our serious competition concerns,\" Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner said in a statement.\"Without sufficient remedies, this merger would have resulted in higher prices for the signalling systems that keep passengers safe and for the next generations of very high-speed trains,\" she added.Siemens makes ICE trains for Deutsche Bahn and builds units for Channel Tunnel operator Eurostar. Alstom manufactures France's TGV bullet train amongst other rolling stock and signalling systems. The tie-up would have created an entity with revenues of approximately \u20ac15bn (\u00a313bn) with significant operations across Europe's rail network. But China's state owned railway behemoth CRRC, the largest global player, has been competing more aggressively for overseas contracts in recent years.In December Alstom and Siemens submitted proposals to address the Commission's competition concerns. These included selling signalling and rolling stock products. But the measures failed to satisfy the competition authority.But those supporting the deal, including government ministers in both France and Germany said the Commission should look beyond Europe in sectors such as transport and banking.German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Berlin and Paris were working on a proposal to change European competition rules.Siemens' chief executive Joe Kaeser said: \"Europe urgently needs structural reform... protecting customer interests locally must not mean that Europe cannot be on a level playing field with leading nations like China, the United States and others.\"","9":"The best hope for bringing major contracts to Scotland for the building of multi-billion pound offshore wind farms has failed to win a vital order, according to unions.BiFab is believed to have lost out on an order for offshore platforms to yards in Belgium, Spain and the UAE.The company has two mothballed fabrication yards in Fife.Unite and the GMB say the failure to place any of the order for 100 steel jackets in Scotland is a \"scandal\".The two unions have been close to the bid talks and are writing to the Scottish government to push for what they call \"a level playing field\" to compete against foreign companies which have state backing.The unions' warning comes on the morning the UK government sets out a \"sector deal\" for offshore wind, in a bid to boost the British supply chain.In a target set by government with the industry, it is aiming at 30% of Britain's electricity demand being met by offshore wind by 2030.  It also wants to triple employment in the sector.However, foreign suppliers dominate the market, and British content in arrays built so far has been well below 50%. The sector deal aims to increase that to 60%.There are only two plants in Britain making turbine blades, on Humberside and the Isle of Wight. A factory in Campbeltown makes the towers for the turbines, and is in the bidding process for work for the Moray East array.BiFab also owns a fabrication yard at Arnish on the Isle of Lewis. In better news for the company, work started there on Wednesday on a contract for Moray East to make 100 piles to anchor the platforms on the seabed. The Hebridean yard had also been mothballed.The order on which BiFab was pinning hopes of a return to production at Burntisland and Methil in Fife is for 100 steel jackets on which turbines will sit, off the east coast of Caithness.The Moray East wind array is one of three major wind farms off the east coast of Scotland which are approved, have subsidised contracts to produce electricity for the national grid, and are at the stage of placing orders.Of the 100 jackets or platforms, 45 have been ordered by the first tier contractor from UAE yards owned by the Lamprell company.Unions believe that another 35 jackets will be fabricated by the Smulders company in Belgium, with some work being done at its UK fabrication yard on Tyneside.The remaining 20 are thought to be going to Navartia, the Spanish-governed owned builder of ships for the Spanish navy, which has sustained large losses in recent years.Last week, Navartia was named as the winner of a bid to build platforms for a pilot wind array south-east of Aberdeen, in which six turbines will trial new technology for floating wind turbines. One small turbine began production at that Kincardine array in autumn.There was no confirmation or denial that BiFab has been unsuccessful in the bid from procurement contractor Deme, DF Barnes, the Canadian company which owns BiFab, or from EDPR, the Portuguese company which is leading the Moray East developer consortium.They all said an announcement would be made soon.The Scottish government, which took an equity stake in BiFab when it was rescued from collapse last year, declined to comment on what it called speculation.A spokesman repeated a statement made last week, when concerns were raised about the state of contract negotiations.\"We have made a long-term investment in the company, and are in regular contact with BiFab, however, we do not participate in operational management decisions,\" the spokesman said.\"It was clear at the point new ownership was secured that conditions would remain challenging for the yards and new contracts would have to be won to secure future work.\"We have confidence that everything possible is being done to secure new contracts and to restore employment both in the Western Isles and Fife.\"In a joint statement on Wednesday night, GMB Scotland secretary Gary Smith and Unite Scotland secretary Pat Rafferty said: \"Ten years ago we were promised a 'Saudi Arabia of Renewables' but today we need political intervention to help level the playing field in Scottish offshore renewables manufacturing.\"The truth is that state funded European energy and engineering firms, backed by Far East finance and Middle East sovereign wealth funds, are carving-up thousands of jobs and billions of pounds from our renewables sector, and firms like BiFab are left fighting for scraps off our own table.\"That 100% of the manufacturing of the turbine jackets for Moray East and five platforms for Kincardine will be done in yards outside of Scotland is an absolute scandal. This cannot continue unchallenged.\"\"To working-class communities in Burntisland and Methil there's no 'just transition' or 'green jobs revolution' here, just a future that looks heavily rigged against their hopes for employment and prosperity. That's the real cost of long-term political failure at all levels of government.\" \"The Scottish government and the public have a stake in BiFab and with it our renewables manufacturing future; we owe it to our ourselves to tackle the spaghetti bowl of vested interest groups that's dominating our renewables sector and to fight for Scotland's share.\"","10":"Patisserie Valerie is being bought out of administration in a deal that will save nearly 2,000 jobs.The management team at the coffee and cake chain has secured backing from investment firm Causeway Capital to take over 96 shops.Sister brand Philpotts has also been sold in a separate deal, saving a further 21 stores. Collectively the chains fetched \u00a313m - a fraction of what the group was once worth.Patisserie Valerie's parent company, Patisserie Holdings, collapsed in January following an accounting scandal.Patisserie Valerie's chief executive, Steve Francis, who is leading the management team buy-out, said the move would end \"a disruptive period of uncertainty for the business\" and provide the foundation for \"an exciting future\".Matt Scaife, a partner at Dublin-based Causeway Capital, said Patisserie Valerie was a \"much loved\" heritage brand that his firm looked forward to helping return to growth. Luke Johnson, until recently the firm's chairman and biggest shareholder, said: \"While I'm naturally deeply disappointed at the events that led us to this point, I wish the company well.\"The entrepreneur, whose stake in the group was worth \u00a3165m back in October, will no longer be involved in the business. Mr Francis told the Financial Times that he and other managers would own \"more than the usual 10% [of Patisserie Valerie], but nowhere near control\".Another subsidiary, Baker & Spice, is still seeking a buyer but Patisserie Holdings said there had been \"strong interest\".Patisserie Valerie was plunged into crisis in October when accounting irregularities were uncovered. It hired KPMG to try to salvage the brand which dates back nearly 100 years.KPMG closed 70 outlets, with the loss of 920 jobs. Restructuring talks broke down in January, leaving no option but administration.The Serious Fraud Office is carrying out a criminal investigation into Patisserie Valerie and finance director Chris Marsh was arrested and released on bail after having been suspended by the company. Also under investigation, by the Financial Reporting Council, are former Patisserie Valerie auditors Grant Thornton.The first Patisserie Valerie opened in Soho in 1926, established by Belgian husband and wife team Theo and Esther Vermeirsch. Esther, born Esther van Gyseghem, became known as Madame Valerie. The chain expanded rapidly across the UK after entrepreneur Luke Johnson invested in the brand in 2006.","11":"A pilot has resigned from South African Airways (SAA) after flying for more than 20 years with a fake licence.SAA said it discovered William Chandler's paperwork was forged after a \"reportable incident\" during a flight from South Africa to Germany.The airline has filed criminal charges and is seeking \"millions of rand\" from Mr Chandler.A safety officer at SAA has also been suspended for allegedly trying to cover up the forgery.South African newspaper the Mail & Guardian (M&G) reported that Mr Chandler worked as a flight engineer at the state-owned SAA before getting a job as a pilot in 1994. He was a Senior First Officer, a role where he was a monitoring pilot but did not command any aircraft.Sources told the M&G that he was, however, in control of a plane that \"made some strange turns\" after encountering turbulence over the Swiss Alps.SAA said in a statement that, after investigating the incident, it found Mr Chandler had only a commercial pilot's licence. He later resigned.Airlines require pilots to have an airline transport pilot licence (ATPL) for long-haul international flights.For an ATPL, pilots must pass several technical and medical exams and complete 1,500 hours of flying time.Licence-holders must \"refresh\" their credentials every year in a series of tests involving flight simulations and physical exams.The certificates are awarded in South Africa by the country's civil aviation authority (SACAA).\"What seems to have happened here is that the pilot would have taken what we have issued to them... and would have changed those documents to give an impression that they are in possession of an ATPL,\" said Phindiwe Gwembu, an SACAA spokesperson.Mr Chandler had reportedly refused a promotion to captain that would have required him to resubmit his ATPL certificate.Tlali Tlali, a spokesperson for SAA, said that the alleged fraud was \"disconcerting\" but had not posed \"any safety risk\" since Mr Chandler was still in possession of a flying licence and had completed safety training. Mr Tlali added that \"necessary steps will be taken to recover the money unduly paid to him\" including salary, overtime and allowances.SACAA said it was investigating any \"loopholes\" in its practices.In a statement, the SAA also said it had submitted the licences of all its pilots to the SACAA for evaluation, and would obtain licences from examination bodies from now on, rather than from individuals.The airline, one of Africa's largest, has lost money every year since 2011, and survives on government support.Last November, South Africa's finance minister Tito Mboweni told a US investor conference that the firm should be shut down. But President Cyril Ramaphosa has pledged to revive it.","12":"If you want to get this briefing by email, sign-up hereA damning report has found that problems with the part-privatisation of the probation service in England and Wales have cost taxpayers almost \u00a3500m. Changes introduced in 2014 saw 21 companies awarded contracts to supervise low and medium-risk offenders, while high-risk offenders remained the responsibility of a new state body, the National Probation Service. The National Audit Office says the \"rushed roll-out\" caused \"significant risks\" and warns that the number of offenders sent back to prison for reoffending has soared. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw says the report is \"scathing\" and \"raises the most serious questions about decision-making at the Ministry of Justice\". Justice minister Rory Stewart says that while the performance of the private probation companies was \"too often deeply disappointing\", the government did step in to end contracts early, as well as spending an extra \u00a322m a year in services for offenders on release.It's not the first time the 2014 changes have come in for criticism. Last June, MPs on the justice select committee said the system was \"a mess\" and doubted they would deliver an effective probation service.

Washington says Hamza Bin Laden, who is thought to be about 30, has emerged as a key leader of the terror group and has released audio and video messages calling on supporters to avenge his father's death. Osama Bin Laden was killed by US Navy Seals in a raid on the compound in Pakistan where he was living in 2011. The US state department says it has evidence gathered during the operation in Abbottabad that Hamza was being groomed by his father to take on the leadership of al-Qaeda. Officials are uncertain where Hamza Bin Laden is, but believe he may be in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, and may also make trips to Iran.Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morningThe children's charity the NSPCC is calling for a new law to force social media firms to do more to protect children, after reporting that more than 5,000 online grooming offences were recorded by police in England and Wales in the 18 months to September 2018. The NSPCC says Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat were used in 70% of cases of sexual communication with a child. The charity argues that 10 years of \"failed self-regulation\" by the social media giants means ministers have to \"tame the Wild West Web\" with legislation. In one case of abuse given by the charity, Emily - not her real name - describes how a man groomed her at the age of 13, eventually persuading her to meet him, before driving her to woods \"to have sex\", leaving her \"bleeding and crying\".

The government-commissioned review of student finance is expected to call for a cut in fees, with the figure of \u00a37,500 now being floated. The review will send a tough message for universities about value for money. But further education and skills are expected to be given much more support, including easier access to loans.Read the full article The case of Sally Challen, a woman who killed her husband in 2010 after saying she had suffered decades of coercive control, leads several of Friday's front pages.

I would have been a lot better off now,\" he said.He went to rival chain Perfect Home after his TV broke.\"The ticket price was \u00a3450 for a 42 inch TV, but by the end I paid about \u00a32,000.\"Under the new rules the interest charged will only be as much as the cost of the product, but the price of the goods themselves will also be limited.Shops will be able to charge no more than the median - the middle price - of three mainstream retailers, including delivery and installation charges.Rent-to-own stores offer people the chance to buy items they need for their home - such as TVs or washing machines - through smaller, regular payments, instead of paying for the goods in one go.But once interest charges have been added, some rent-to-own consumers have ended up paying more than four times the retail price they would have paid in normal shops.Rent-to-own shops will still be able to charge for insurance and warranties on top of that, but the FCA said it would stop firms from increasing their prices for insurance premiums, extended warranties, or arrears charges, to recoup lost revenue from the price cap.\"The measures come into force from 1 April and we will be keeping a close watch on firms' compliance,\" said Mr Woolard.\"We will review the impact of the price cap in 2020 and if further work is needed to protect these customers we are prepared to intervene again.\"The main companies offering rent-to-own goods are Brighthouse and PerfectHome.A BrightHouse spokesperson said: \"We remain committed to offering our customers, who are excluded from mainstream credit, great service and the best prices possible for the products they require. \"Over the coming months we will fully implement the changes that have been confirmed today.\"A spokesperson at PerfectHome said: \"Our customers will start seeing changes to our agreement terms for new products in the coming weeks, in readiness for the start date set by the FCA, 1 April 2019. \"The changes will apply to new agreements only; customers with existing agreements will not be affected.\"MoneySavingExpert founder Martin Lewis welcomed the confirmation.\"The rent-to-own sector is perhaps the most visceral example of the poverty premium in the UK,\" he said.\"The fact that the most vulnerable with the least, pay four times as much for their electrical and white goods as everyone else is simply unjust, and it's rightfully about time that the FCA cracks down on it.\"Andrew Hagger, finance analyst from Moneycomms, also welcomed the news.He said: \"It's good to see the regulator stepping in to protect some of the most financially vulnerable in our society.\"These people have been taken advantage of for far too long, mainly because the retailers know such customers often have nowhere else to turn.\"The credit cap of 100% is a welcome move and it's pleasing that the FCA won't let these retailers recoup their money via the back door by increasing the cost of add on insurances,\" he added.","15":"Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund is expected to sell some of its oil and gas holdings.The world's largest sovereign wealth fund owns $37bn of shares in oil companies such as BP, Shell and France's Total.Selling the shares means it would not be as reliant on oil prices, it says. But Norway's finance ministry said oil will still be central to Norway's economy.Norway is western Europe's biggest oil and gas producer and its sovereign wealth fund, known officially as the Government Pension Fund, is used to invest the proceeds of the country's oil industry.The move is being positioned as a way to diversify the nation's wealth away from oil, not a judgement about the future price of oil.\"The oil industry will be an important and major industry in Norway for many years to come,\" it said in a statement. However, it said: \"A permanent reduction in the oil price will have long-term implications for public finances.\"The government recommendation must still be approved by the country's parliament before going ahead. It will also spare large oil majors which both explore for and refine oil, such as Shell, BP, Exxon and Total, instead recommending the sale of smaller oil firms which focus on finding and drilling oil, of which Norway owns about $8bn.The advice follows a report from Norway's central bank in 2017 that dropping oil and gas investment would be a good economic move.The government still owns 67% of Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, which is an oil and gas company which pumps the equivalent of two million barrels of oil per day. The company is diversifying into wind and solar energy.What to do with an embarrassment of riches? Although it was under some pressure to sell its holdings in the oil and gas sector for environmental reasons, Norway's Central Bank has made it clear that it is selling some of its $37bn of energy shares for more boring reasons, it doesn't like having all its eggs in one basket.This is fairly sensible and obvious if you think about it, Norway instead of immediately spending all its vast income from its oil and gas production and living high on the hog, has been eminently sensible and invested a significant part of it for future generations. This Sovereign Wealth Fund is now worth some $1 trillion with investments and shareholdings around the world. It has been ethical about what it invests in and doesn't buy shares in, tobacco companies for instance. But if you make all your money out of producing and selling oil and gas, putting  your savings in oil and gas is not very sensible. There have been plenty of people over the years who have put their life savings and pensions in the firm they earn a wage from and lived to regret it when the firm went bust, losing their job, pension and savings in one fell swoop. Norway has decided to not take that risk.Shares in oil and gas companies fell slightly this morning but this move was expected and Norway is hardly likely to sell all the shares immediately or all at once, both of which would probably force down share prices sharply when it wants to get the best possible return on its investment. ","16":"In our series of letters from African writers, Kenyan journalist Waihiga Mwaura asks whether Kenyans have lost hope of tackling the scourge of corruption in the country.Shocking revelations over the last month that Kenya may have lost 21bn shillings ($210m; \u00a3162m) of taxpayers' money only resulted in a few newspaper headlines.Dubbed the dam scandal, investigators are looking into allegations that the money was spent on two dams in the Rift Valley that have never been built.Kenyans like to get outraged on Twitter, but the social media hoo-ha petered out fairly quickly amid some political statements and promises to investigate.The truth is that Kenyans have been here before. Different scandals. Different suspects. Different amounts of money. Same taxpayers footing the bill.In the latest scandal, it is alleged that one firm was paid $80,000 for cutlery, while another company supplied towels worth $220,000.These are not strange items to supply - until you ask yourself: \"What role do they have to play in the construction of a dam?\"No wonder popular musician and activist Juliani recently suggested that corruption should be legalised and defined in Kenya so that everyone knows what they are dealing with.And these are not the most surprising revelations that have come out of graft investigations in Kenya. In 2016 a hairdresser was at pains to explain how she had gone from a simple hair stylist to a millionaire who had set up companies to receive $18m from National Youth Service - a government initiative to train young people in life and business skills. The hairdresser denied the allegations but the entire scandal involving the youth agency is believed to have cost taxpayers $78m through payments to ghost suppliers - yet the results of the full investigation into the alleged scam are still to be published.The Goldenberg scandalIn the 1990s, members of the Kenyan government colluded with the international company Goldenberg to export gold that had come from third countries at subsidised prices. Although the scheme was supposed to earn the country money, it ended up costing an estimated 60bn shillings - 10% of Kenya's annual GDP. Officials of former President Daniel arap Moi's government, some at the highest level, were implicated in the scandal. A 2004 commission of inquiry recommended that several prominent people be investigated but no-one has been jailed. The Anglo Leasing scandalThe Anglo Leasing affair, which involved contracts being awarded to phantom firms, shocked Kenyans when it was revealed in 2004.Anglo Leasing Finance was paid about 30m euro ($33m; \u00a321m) to supply the Kenyan government with a system to print new high-technology passports; other fictitious companies involved in the scam were given money to supply naval ships and forensic laboratories.In 2015, seven former government officials were charged. The case is still ongoing. The National Youth Service scandalLast year, the head of the National Youth Service (NYS) was arrested as part of an investigation into the alleged theft of 8bn shillings. The missing funds were allegedly stolen in a scheme involving senior government officials and ghost suppliers. Prosecutors have charged 35 people. All have denied the accusations.It is now possible to work out how much Kenya has lost to corruption since independence in 1964 - the website trackcorruption.org has put the figure at an estimated $66bn. This is public money that has been lost, stolen or misused - funds that could have built schools, hospitals and many dams.Transparency International announced in its latest report that corruption was getting worse in Kenya - on its corruption index Kenya was ranked 144 out of 180 countries in the world, dropping a place in the last year.   Samuel Kimeu, executive director of Transparency International Kenya, said in January: \"Some of the key institutions in the anti-corruption chain have faced significant challenges in delivering their mandates mainly because of a pervading culture of impunity among the political and economic elite.\"A notable anti-graft crusader recently told me that corruption was no longer a parasite in Kenya but was now firmly entrenched at the centre.Marilyn Kamuru, a lawyer and activist, urged Kenyans on a live TV show to stop calling it corruption and instead call it \"robbery with violence\".Many applauded her statement, urging fellow Kenyans to stop pussyfooting around a crisis and call it by its real name.But life goes on in one of East Africa's largest economies and even the Kenyan shilling is no longer surprised by the revelations - it has jumped to its strongest level against the dollar in more than three-and-a-half years in the last week.Don't get me wrong- it isn't that Kenyans have just buried their heads in the sand.Everywhere I go, corruption is the discussion. From the barbershop and hotel conference to the TV studio and family gathering. People are angry. But nothing happens after that.But all is not lost. One recent encouraging stories was how a young airport security officer in Kisumu had compelled a police officer (effectively his superior) to pay a fine. The policeman had parked on the pavement, his vehicle was then clamped and when he returned to it, he had no choice but to pay the fine after he realised that he could not bully his way out of this one.That is a classic example of speaking truth to power.

In the end, 34 people and three companies were charged by Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election.  Here's our guide to the main characters in the four seasons of the only political drama that mattered.This was the season in which Donald Trump, the reality TV star, took centre stage in his own political drama by launching a presidential campaign. He was supported by his family and got the attention of the Russians. The season ended with a cliffhanger - could Trump the outsider actually win?!It's been a while since all of this happened, so let's remind you of the key players in this season.Who was he? Donald Trump, the billionaire candidate (who by Season Three is the 45th president of the United States). If you really need a refresher, here's his life story.Key plot line As Donald Trump was busy traversing the country canvassing for votes in Season One, Russia hacked into the emails of his Democratic rivals, investigators later said.The question is why? Was the Kremlin trying to alter the outcome of the election, and what did Trump and his campaign know?Skip forward to the end of Season Four and Mr Trump stood triumphant before reporters in a Florida airport, celebrating what he called \"a complete and total exoneration\".But in between, there was no shortage of drama or tension.Who was he? He was Trump's campaign chairman before being forced to quit over his ties to Russian oligarchs and Ukraine.Key plot line He was one of the biggest dominoes to fall. When he ended up being arrested, it was a big season-ending shocker.Manafort hung around a bit in Season One, but then disappeared from view for a while.He quit the campaign after being accused of having links to pro-Russian groups in Ukraine. He also sat in on a crucial meeting with a Russian lawyer who may have been trying to feed the Trump team classified information (more on that later).After an FBI raid on his home in Season Three, Manafort was found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud, and failing to disclose foreign banks accounts and is sentenced to 47 months in prison.In Season Four, he agreed to co-operate with a special counsel inquiry in exchange for a reduced prison term. But then, in a twist - prosecutors claimed he breached his plea bargain by repeatedly lying to the FBI.Read more: The man who helped Trump winWho was he? The president's eldest child, who it emerged met some questionable Russians.Key plot line Donald Trump Jr's role in this unfolding saga all came down to a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer, which was set up by a music publicist (the full details of which come out in Season Three). If it sounds random, then in many ways it is.The publicist, Rob Goldstone, offered Trump Jr a meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, promising him dirt on Hillary Clinton.This meeting was the key to much of our plot line because it raised several key questions. Did this amount to the campaign colluding with a foreign government? Why did he agree to the meeting?What happened at the meeting was the scene investigators played over and over again as they tried to work out if there was any impropriety. In the end, no collusion charges were brought.Read more: Trump Jr's habit for making headlinesDonald Trump confounded his critics by winning the presidency. But the transition was as gripping as the season before it as Trump picked his cabinet, introducing key characters to the mix.The season ended with Trump taking the oath of office on a cold January morning - but there were more twists to come.Who was he? The granite-faced former general who later became the shortest-serving member of Donald Trump's cabinet. He resigned after not being honest about his contact with a Russian official - and was later charged with making false statements to the FBI.Key plot line Flynn was appointed national security adviser just days after the election, against the advice of then-President Obama, who warned Trump not to hire him. Flynn's starring role came in December 2016, just before Trump was sworn in, when he spoke to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak.The Washington Post and New York Times said the men discussed Russian sanctions, and that Flynn later lied to the Vice President Mike Pence about the conversation (Mr Kislyak says the men discussed only \"simple things\").The substance of those talks eventually led to Flynn being prosecuted as part of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.At the end of Season Three, in December 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to making \"false, fictitious and fraudulent statements\" to the FBI about what he and Kislyak discussed.With that, the investigation reached Trump's inner circle.Read more: Out after 23 days - who is Michael Flynn?Who was he? Many roads in this drama led back to Sergei Kislyak, the jolly and charismatic figure, who up until July 2017 was the Russian ambassador to Washington. Key plot line Kislyak's role in this drama remained unclear up to the end - but many of the players in this drama had meetings with him, and that put them in awkward spots.The key questions for investigators were: why were they drawn to him, and what was said? The Russian ambassador spoke to both Flynn and Attorney-General Jeff Sessions - meetings which both Trump officials didn't initially acknowledge took place.Anything else we should know? Well, Russia fiercely fought back against claims on CNN that Kislyak was a \"top spy and recruiter of spies\".Who was he? Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III hovered in the background during Season One, when he was an Alabama senator and a trusted Trump adviser, but we really got to know him during Season Two, when he became Trump's nominee for attorney general, a job he kept for almost two years.Key plot line Sessions was one of several Trump aides to meet Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, and question marks emerged over the nature of those meetings.When the FBI investigation focused on the Trump campaign, Sessions stood down from the inquiry, much to Trump's irritation.That decision to step down dogged him to the end, and he was written out of the series close to the end of Season Four, when Trump forced him to resign.That move put control of the Mueller investigation into the hands of a Trump loyalist.Read more: An attorney general dogged by scandalThis was where the drama really picked up and all the plot lines came together. A lot of the background characters we saw in Season One came back with a vengeance and the infighting got nasty - and this is when the police started circling.Who was she? A Russian lawyer with a fearsome reputation who fought against US restrictions on Russia. But was she a Kremlin stooge? Despite earlier denials, she admitted in April 2018 to being an \"informant\" for Russia's prosecutor general.Key plot line Hers was a small but crucial role - she's the one who Manafort, Trump Jr and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met in June 2016, the details of which begin trickling out a year later in a flashback sequence. She said the meeting was to discuss adoptions - but those who helped set it up said she was offering dirt on the Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign.While the meeting became a central plot point, whatever happened inside never actually led to any charges.That meeting would never have happened without...Who were they? Emin Agalarov is Azerbaijan's biggest pop star, of course. Have you not heard Love is a Deadly Game? Emin helped bring Donald Trump's Miss Universe competition to Russia and the two are close enough to send each other birthday messages. His dad, Aras, is a billionaire who mixes in the highest circles of influence in Moscow.Key plot line Again in a flashback scene, we met Emin as he set the wheels in motion on that Trump Jr meeting.An email sent to Trump Jr suggested Emin was offering information on the Democrats (Emin said he wasn't). The email also said Aras Agalarov had apparently met the \"crown prosecutor\" of Russia - a role that weirdly didn't exist - and got information on Hillary Clinton.Are you keeping up?Read more: The tough-talking networkerWho was he? He became deputy attorney general under Jeff Sessions. In the TV drama of the Russia scandal, this is the sort of role that would go to a solid Broadway actor you recognise but can't put a name to. Key plot line When Sessions stood down from leading the main investigation into the Trump-Russia ties, it fell to Rosenstein to do that job. In a major plot development, he appointed a special investigator - not a popular move with the White House.Read more: Who is Rod Rosenstein?Who was he? Married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, Kushner was the character who was seen but very rarely heard.Key plot line Amid cries of nepotism, he was given a plum White House job as senior adviser to the president with a wide-ranging portfolio. It was his contacts with the Russians during the election campaign and beyond that led investigators to circle him.In June 2016, Kushner attended THAT meeting with Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer. He said he was so bored he messaged his assistant to call him so he could leave.Kushner was also another character who had repeated contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak - contact that he initially failed to disclose.Read more: The son-in-law with Trump's earWho was he? A British former tabloid journalist, with a penchant for selfies in silly hats, was perhaps an unlikely addition to the cast, but in most good dramas there's always room for the slightly out-of-place eccentric.Key plot line Rob Goldstone found his way into Donald Trump's circle of trust thanks to his connections with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov.Goldstone managed the pop star, and it was he who contacted Donald Trump Jr on behalf of his client to set up that now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016. Goldstone sent an email to Trump Jr promising dirt on Hillary Clinton.Read more: The Music Man with a love for hatsWho was he? At 6ft 8in, James Comey was a towering figure, the character who gave little away about himself personally but had a huge role in this story.Key plot line He first entered this drama in Season One, when as head of the FBI he reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails - just weeks before the election. Democrats blamed him for her loss, Republicans hailed him a hero. That, we thought, was the last we'd seen of him.Jump ahead to Season Three, when months into the Trump presidency, Comey was fired by the new president. In true television drama style, he learned of his sacking as he was watching TV news during a trip to LA. Up to then, Comey was heading up an investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.Even by the end of the series, whether this amounted to obstruction of justice by the president remained an unresolved plot point.Comey's testimony to the Senate was one of the most set-pieces in the series up to this point, as  - under oath - he told politicians he was asked to pledge loyalty to the president, but refused.Read more: The FBI director who took centre stageWho was he? A former election adviser to Trump, although you'd be forgiven if you didn't remember the face. He was in only a few scenes in Season Two, but he had a massive role to play in Season Three, becoming the first person to plead guilty as part of the investigation.Key plot line In late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia.After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone.His guilty plea and co-operation with the investigation had the potential to damage the US leader because it related directly to his campaign - but in the end, it didn't do so.Read more: Why Papadopoulos case mattersWho was he? The man who held the fate of the Trump presidency in his hands.  Key plot line Some characters wielded a lot of power, but didn't have a starring role, such as Robert Mueller, the tall chiselled figure who was appointed as \"special counsel\" to take over the Russia investigation after the dismissal of James Comey. Mueller came from the same stock as Comey - both were former heads of the FBI.There were no showboating scenes and powerhouses speeches from Mueller in this series - we only ever saw him studiously working in his office.There were reports that the president considered firing Mueller at one point - but Mueller stayed in the background doing his job until the very end of the series.After Season Three ended with the first charges being laid down by Robert Mueller, things really sped up in Season Four. The president's fury with the special counsel investigation increased and he fired his Attorney-General. But the series ended with no charges laid against the president and a sense of victory in the White House. Might we see a spin-off series...?Who was he? OK, he wasn't Putin's chef by this point, but he once was. In Season Four, he was the man accused of spearheading Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election.Key plot line A little out of the blue, Mueller announced charges against Prigozhin and 12 other Russians, accusing them of tampering with the US election by (among other things) organising and promoting political rallies in the US.In one surreal flashback sequence, we even see the Russians trying to buy a cage large enough to hold an actress dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison costume.Read more: Seven key takeaways from indictmentWho was he? The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump - but who instead turned against him.Key plot line Cohen, as Trump's long-time personal lawyer, lingered around the edges of the plot for the first three seasons, but became the big player of the fourth.When Mueller's team began looking into Cohen's finances, they passed on their concerns to investigators in New York.Then the plot took an unexpected new turn: Cohen, a long-time Trump loyalist, flipped and began co-operating with investigators. Not only that, but he ended up giving them a lot of help in exchange for a lighter sentence.Cohen ended up admitting violating campaign finance laws, committing tax evasion and lying to Congress.The last shot of the entire series was a mournful Cohen being locked into his jail cell.Who was he? A long-time Washington political operative who acted as an informal adviser to the Trump campaign. He called himself an agent provocateur, and once defended his actions by saying: \"One man's dirty trick is another man's political, civic action.\"Key plot line Stone was one of those memorable bit-part characters in Seasons One and Two - a colourful character known for his fiery tongue, sharp suits and the Richard Nixon tattoo spread across his back.Towards the end of Season One, he appeared to let the cat out of the bag, hinting on Twitter that there was damaging information coming out on Hillary Clinton. Soon after, that information (that we later learned was found by Russia) was made public.After a bit of a lull in the middle of Season Four, investigators indicted Stone on seven counts of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements, although he wasn't charged with co-ordinating with Russia.All the way through, he denied any wrongdoing. He, like the president, called the investigation a \"witch-hunt\" and once said the accusations of collusion with Russia were \"a steaming plate of bull\".","18":"They are the hot new trend in finance, and Marius Jurgilas's mission is to lure them to Lithuania. Yet even he has been shocked by the \"overwhelming\" number of enquiries from UK \"fintech\" companies in recent months.The reason is Brexit. Financial technology companies are making last-minute plans in case of a no-deal Brexit on 29 March. Many are looking to secure financial licences in other EU states to protect their operations, and this Baltic nation has an eye on helping to fill the gap. Mr Jurgilas, a Bank of Lithuania board member, has had some notable successes. Customers of new-age bank Revolut might not know it has acquired its banking licence in Lithuania. Google's parent company Alphabet has one too. Mr Jurgilas insists his country's new direction is not all about Brexit. \"It was a coincidence,\" he says. \"Mostly we just want innovation to happen here, not 10 years down the road after things are implemented in Sweden.\" Marius Jurgilas is not alone. On the seventh floor of a shiny new office block, the Blockchain Centre is on the hunt for hot new fintech markets in Lithuania's name. Inside, it is silent and the mood intense. Workers in headphones stare at black screens awash with code. Motivational posters on the walls carry messages such as: \"The future will be decentralised.\" This one-year-old centre - which offers co-working space and consultancy services to start-ups using blockchain technology - plays to its EU credentials. Its website has an EU rather than a Lithuanian domain.But chief executive Egle Nemeikstyte says the centre is casting its net far beyond Europe. Australia, Singapore and Israel all want EU partners.There is still plenty of scepticism about how blockchain should be used, and Ms Nemeikstyte sometimes has to dissuade people from jumping on the bandwagon. \"Lots of people come to us with ideas and we say that's great, but you don't need blockchain for it. Go ahead without it,\" she advises. Lithuania's expansion has been compared to Iceland, where the three biggest banks grew too fast and collapsed during the financial crisis of 2008.Marius Jurgilas insists such comparisons are unfair and Lithuania is far from gung-ho in the field. \"We don't have the framework yet to know how to manage the risks. We don't want to go too fast in that area,\" he says of blockchain and crypto-currencies.And yet the Bank of Lithuania offers \"no regulatory sanctions for the first year of operations\", which some have suggested could be a sign of laxity. Officials will also be keen to avoid the money-laundering cases that befell its neighbours, Latvia and Estonia.What Lithuania does offer is a regulatory \"sandbox\", which allows financial technology companies to test products in a limited environment and under supervision.Such sandboxes are not common, but they are cropping up in places as disparate as Arizona and Kuwait. Critics worry that they mark a race to the bottom, but supporters insist they boost innovation and can be well-managed. One of Lithuania's biggest coups, or perhaps risks, has been in backing financial technology company Revolut. Valued at $1.7bn (\u00a31.3bn), it is one of the world's fast-growing app-based banks. Brexit is a primary reason for its move to Vilnius, but it will still retain its London HQ and the electric money licence it has from UK regulators.Last year it advertised for its third head of compliance in less than 18 months, and some have argued that it may be expanding too fast. However, the company insists it is just looking for the right fit. And there was \"no cutting corners\" when the company secured its specialised banking licence from Lithuania, insists head of business development Andrius Biceika.That will allow Revolut to offer full current accounts, pay interest on deposits and issue loans. By choosing Lithuania, it can operate across the EU.\"We are going to pilot all this in Lithuania and then passport to other countries,\" says Mr Biceika. \"We are seeing lots of companies using Lithuania as a springboard.\" In the UK, all the talk about Lithuania has travelled the corridors of Level 39 - a three-floor tech hub in London's Canary Wharf, where a number of its residents have been making insurance plans for Brexit.TransferGo - a money transferring company for migrant workers - received its electronic money licence from the Lithuanian central bank in July 2018.BABB - a yet-to-launch money transfer company that has no connections to Lithuania - is also midway through the process. While both made the decision because of Brexit uncertainty, both also cited Lithuania's local talent and helpful regulators as other motivations. Go to an event for fintech start-ups in Vilnius and the room teems with enthusiastic young entrepreneurs. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, various international companies came here to save money. Among them was Western Union, where many Lithuanians learnt the ropes of finance.\"We used to compete over low costs,\" says Vilnius Mayor Remigijus Simasius. \"But now it is more about talent.\"Vilnius has certainly been putting itself out there. In mid-2018, it launched a bizarre tourist campaign called \"G-spot of Europe\" complete with tagline: \"Nobody knows where it is but when you find it, it's amazing.\"Co-working hub Rise Vilnius is where you will find dozens of the new companies. Backed by British bank Barclays, it is one of seven such hubs in Mumbai, Tel Aviv, London, Manchester, Cape Town and New York.\"There was scepticism that we would find enough fintech start-ups here, but we proved them wrong,\" says Mariano Andrade Gonzalez, executive director of Barclays' operations centre in Lithuania.The mayor of Vilnius says companies have discovered that the city's workforce is particularly suited to the new start-ups, because Lithuanians have good mathematical skills.\"Maybe that goes down to the dark times of the Soviet Union. People studied these things instead of social studies.\"It was natural for us to move into fintech, even before Brexit. We are willing to adapt to the future, not fight it.\"","19":"The value of exports from Scotland grew by \u00a34bn in 2017, up 5% on the previous year, according to new estimates.Total exports from Scotland, excluding oil and gas, rose to \u00a381.4bn - including \u00a348.9bn to the rest of the UK, and \u00a332.4bn of international sales.Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said the figures were \"great news\" and highlighted the growth in international exports.Scottish Secretary David Mundell said trade within the UK was \"essential\".Both politicians used the figures to make arguments about constitutional politics, with Mr Mackay warning of the \"risk\" of a no-deal Brexit and Mr Mundell arguing against Scottish independence.The latest estimates show international exports increased by 6.2%, while those to the rest of the UK were up by 4.6%.The bulk of the growth in international exports were to the EU, with sales up by 13.3% to \u00a314.9bn.The US continued to be Scotland's top international export destination, with an estimated \u00a35.5bn of exports in 2017.The top five international markets - the US, the Netherlands, France, Germany and Ireland - accounted for 44% of the total overseas exports, at \u00a314.3bn. Mr Mackay said the figures were \"great news\", following on from record low unemployment figures the previous week.However, he said the \"uncertainty\" associated with Brexit continued to be \"the key risk to Scotland's economy\".He added: \"It is vital that the UK government responds to the vote of the House of Commons on 29 January and takes immediate and urgent steps to rule out a no-deal Brexit, which threatens to have devastating consequences for our economy, extend the Article 50 process and hold a second referendum on EU membership.\"Mr Mundell said: \"The Scottish government's own figures show that our trade with the UK is now worth \u00a334bn more than our trade with all 27 EU countries combined.\"It is absolutely essential for Scotland's economy that trade within our UK internal market continues unimpeded.\"Almost every day we hear fresh threats from the first minister to call a second independence referendum, yet these figures show the union is vitally important for jobs, businesses and prosperity across Scotland.\"","20":"With India's general election just months away, the annual budget was all about Prime Minister Narendra Modi trying to resell his 2014 election pledge of hope. The question is will it work, asks economist Vivek Kaul.  Around an hour into his speech, finance minister Piyush Goyal spoke about a recent Bollywood film, Uri: The Surgical Strike. It celebrates the Indian army's strikes in 2016 against suspected militants in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. He said while watching the film he'd been impressed with the audience's passionate reaction, reportedly inspired by the movie's overt nationalism. If there was any doubt this was an election-minded budget, it was put to rest by Mr Goyal's reference to Uri. India's budget, the last before the next government is elected, offered something for almost everyone - from distressed farmers to its vast informal workforce to a growing middle class. The biggest announcement was an income support scheme for farmers with cultivable land of up to two hectares (4.9 acres) - they will receive 6,000 rupees (about $84; \u00a364) every year in their bank accounts. At an estimated cost of $2.8bn, it will benefit nearly 120 million small and marginal farming households or 600 million people. That is a significant portion of the voting population and a little less than half of the Indian population, which will make this the world's biggest income support scheme. Although Mr Goyal did not say so, this is an attempt to tackle India's agrarian crisis. Agriculture has been blighted by a depleting water table, shrinking farms and declining productivity for decades, while farmers struggle to repay debt to banks and money lenders. But the problem lies in determining eligibility as land records across large parts of India are not always reliable. Rahul Gandhi, leader of the main opposition Congress party, has also proposed a similar scheme, if elected to power. Mr Goyal also proposed a pension scheme for India's informal workers, who he said numbered 420 million. It will only target those with a monthly income of $210 or more and is contributory - so they would have to set aside a minimum amount each month, which the government will match. It would certainly help a workforce with almost no rights or benefits, but the trouble is that most unorganised workers are paid in cash. And their income varies as many work as contract labour on farms or construction sites. So it would be hard to decide who is eligible. The important question is who will pay for these schemes? In economics, there is no free lunch. Someone has to foot the bill and often that is in the form of higher taxes. That someone is likely to be India's middle class. The budget offered goodies to them as well. Those earning up to $7,013 will not have to pay any income tax (the limit was $3,506 earlier).A positive change, which will be a relief to all tax payers, is that the government is working on processing income tax returns and initiating refunds within 24 hours. But this did not stop Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from turning the budget presentation into a political performance. In his speech, Mr Goyal made  a point thanking Mr Modi many times and listed the achievements of his party. BJP members even began chanting \"Modi\" mid-way through the speech.In the run-up to the 2014 elections, Mr Modi had campaigned for a better India, using the slogan \"acche din aane waale hain\" (happy days are about to come) and promising to create jobs.But five years later, a leaked government report shows unemployment levels have reached a 46-year high under Mr Modi. It remains to be seen whether Indians will believe Mr Modi's story of hope again. And it's worth remembering this is an interim budget that will remain in effect only until the election, which is expected in April or May. The newly elected government will have to ratify the schemes in its budget later this year.Vivek Kaul is an economist and the author of the Easy Money trilogy.","21":"Brexit continues to dominate the political agenda with key votes possible at Westminster this week.Although Holyrood will play no central part on where the Brexit story goes next, the issue will be a topic of discussion for MSPs.On Thursday afternoon there will be a statement on how Brexit impacts further and higher education, as well as Brexit portfolio questions.The bulk of the ministerial statement will be on how universities and colleges are preparing for leaving the EU, after some warned that no deal was \"one of the biggest threats\" the sector had ever faced.What else is happening at the Scottish Parliament this week?Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing will give a statement on the future of fisheries on Tuesday afternoon, after the topical question on reports that the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital faces a repair bill of up to \u00a350 million.The Scottish government published a discussion paper at the start of the month on what will follow the common fisheries policy (CFP).The UK leaves the CFP when it leaves the European Union.The paper commits to \"preventing any attempt by the UK government to allow permanent access to the Scottish zone as part of future trade deals\" - a prospect which has troubled fishermen over the last two years.After that, MSPs will debate the government's recently published fair work action plan which commits to ensuring 25,000 more people earn the living wage by 2022.It also highlights resources given to social care work after in inquiry found staff frequently worked beyond contracted hours and did unpaid overtime. To end the day, Green MSP Andy Wightman leads a member's debate on land ownership in Scotland, in which he will criticise the lack of transparency in this area.In the morning, the environment committee looks at the wildlife crime annual report with Police Scotland, the Crown Office and the SSPCA giving evidence. There was a 36% fall in recorded birds of prey crimes between 2016 and 2017 - but data from satellite-tagged raptors continued to show birds suspiciously \"disappearing\".Elsewhere, NHS Borders is under the microscope at the health committee, while the justice committee looks at amendments to the Vulnerable Witnesses (Criminal Evidence) (Scotland) Bill.City region deals will be scrutinised by the local government committee on Wednesday morning.Representatives from Clackmannanshire, Stirling and North Ayrshire councils will be giving evidence alongside the Edinburgh and Tayside city deal teams.There has been some tension between the Scottish and UK governments about the amount of funding each is putting into the deals and the time it has taken for plans to come to fruition.Then the committee will take evidence from Housing Minister Kevin Stewart on the minimum income standard in relation to the Fuel Poverty Bill.The minimum income standard seeks to define a level of income which households need to reach an acceptable standard of living.Elsewhere, the finance committee is looking at Scottish VAT assignment - in other words the calculation of how much cash the Scottish government receives from VAT.In the afternoon, transport and justice ministers face portfolio question time before MSPs debate the Year of Young People 2018.Then Tory MSP Liz Smith marks the centenary of Sir Hugh Munro's death - a founding member of the Scottish Mountaineering Club and the first person to publish a complete list of Scotland's munros.First minister's questions will take place from noon.Then Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur leads a member's debate on the 50th anniversary of the Longhope lifeboat disaster, in which eight crew members died.After lunch, the addition of portfolio questions to a Thursday puts Brexit and constitution ministers in the hot seat.The statement on Brexit and universities will be followed by a government-led debate on tech and engineering in the space sector.The A'Mhoine Peninsula in Sutherland will be the location of the UK's first spaceport, to launch some time in the early 2020s.It is hoped this will allow Scotland to become Europe's leading space nation.Why is this important? Having spaceports would allow UK industry to offer the full \"turn key\" product to their customers - from design, to build, to launch.But some campaigners oppose the use of the Melness Crofting Estate for the spaceport, raising concerns about its impact on the environment, local roads and crofting rights.As ever, it will be about balancing competing rights - something MSPs will be grappling with during the debate.Beginning the day the Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs Committee taking evidence on UK-EU Inter-institutional relations post-Brexit.MSPs will then take evidence from Global Radio, following the announcement that it will replace the 40-plus local breakfast shows with three nationwide programmes.","22":"First-time buyers now make up the majority of home purchases bought with a mortgage in the UK, figures show.The Halifax bank said the last time such a situation existed was 1995.Its research found Pendle in Lancashire and Copeland in Cumbria were the most affordable areas, with homes costing 2.6 times local earnings on average.An average deposit of \u00a332,841 is required to get on the property ladder in the UK, but first-time buyers in London need to find \u00a3110,656.The Halifax First-Time Buyer Review is based on figures from industry group UK Finance, as well as its own house price database and Office for National Statistics earnings figures.Halifax said first-time owners in 2018 accounted for just over half of all sales with a mortgage.There has been an overall increase in UK first-time buyers from 192,300 in 2008 to 372,000 in 2018, although in Scotland and Wales numbers have fallen, the research found.According to the Halifax , the average price of a typical first home has jumped by 39%, from \u00a3153,030 in 2008 to \u00a3212,473 in 2018.It said terraced houses, followed by semi-detached properties, were the first-time buyer's home of choice over the past decade.A first-time buyer would be close to being able to buy a home outright in the north east of England or Northern Ireland for the same money it would take to raise a deposit in the capital last year, where the average price paid by a first-time buyer was \u00a3426,857.In north-east England the average first-time buyer home was \u00a3126,104 while in Northern Ireland it was \u00a3129,615.In Wales a first-time buyer spent an average of \u00a3144,542 in 2018, and in Scotland it was \u00a3141,671.Russell Galley, managing director at the Halifax, said the continued growth in first-time buyers came despite a shortage of homes and the ongoing challenge of raising a deposit.Jackie Bennett, director of mortgages at UK Finance, said competitive mortgage deals and government schemes such as Help to Buy have boosted the market for first-time buyers while new buy-to-let purchases were \"dampened\" by tax and regulatory changes. East Ayrshire in Scotland was identified as the third most affordable area, with homes at three times local gross earnings.Brent, in north-west London, was identified as the least affordable area, with first-time buyer property prices at 13.3 times local earnings, followed by two other areas in the capital - Hackney and Newham, in east London.Oxford was the only place outside London among the top 10 least affordable areas for first-time buyers, where average prices were nearly 11 times local earnings.","23":"Nigeria is Africa's largest economy and the continent's biggest oil producer.But it is a country where more than half the population lives in poverty, and 60% of the urban population cannot afford the cheapest house. There are also some very rich Nigerians indeed and the gap between rich and poor is all too clear to see in the country's largest cities.Ahead of Nigeria's elections on 23 February, BBC Reality Check examines whether the poor are getting poorer and if the wealth gap is getting wider. The government argues that it has combated poverty and blames past governments for mismanaging the oil industry and the economy.\"It is not that poverty has reduced considerably, no. I am saying that what has happened now is that we are dealing with the issue of poverty,\" said Vice-President Prof Yemi Osinbajo. Prof Osinbajo is the running mate for incumbent president, Muhammadu Buhari.Mr Buhari's principal opponent in the election, Atiku Abubakar, says Nigeria's economy has never been in a worse state than it is now.\"The most important question in this election is: are you better off than you were four years ago, are you richer or poorer?\"The Nigerian economy has only recently shown signs of recovery after a period of recession that ended in 2017.The unemployment rate provided by the government's National Bureau of Statistics is more than 20%. Here's another key statistic - about 60% of the population lives in absolute poverty - measured by the number who can afford only the bare essentials of shelter, food and clothing. This figure is from a household poverty survey released by the government in 2012.  There is a frustrating lack of more recent data available, although a revised poverty survey is currently under way.However, experts see little sign that the situation for the poorest has improved significantly.\"With increase in population and continuing lack of jobs, it is evident that the gulf between the haves and the have nots will continue to widen in the future,\" said Bongo Adi, an economist at the Lagos Business School. There's certainly a widespread perception that inequality is getting worse.\"Nigeria has a long history of mismanagement, corruption and disregard for due process\" that has contributed to the high number of people living in poverty, says Abdulazeez Musa, Oxfam's Nigeria-based analyst. As for the gap between rich and poor, Nigerian economist Bismarck Rewane estimates that only 5% of the population controls roughly about 40% of Nigeria's wealth.Poverty-reduction policies do exist, he says, but they are not backed up by the political will or the good governance to implement them.\"Vested interest is far in excess of national interest,\" he says. Poverty rates are higher in northern states than they are in parts of the south.  Sokoto State in the far north-west of the country has the highest level of poverty at 81% while the figure for the south-western state of Lagos is 34%.  A widely used measure of inequality that rates the distribution of income in a society is known as the Gini scale - for which the higher the number, the greater the inequality.Nigeria's rate rose 15% between 2004 and 2010, the latest year for which the data is available.Poverty is \"staring us in the face\", says Omolara Adesanya, a candidate for governor of Lagos state.About half of Nigeria's population lives in cities, but the divide between the poor and the rich has created a paradox - many newly built houses in the wealthier areas of Lagos are empty, while overcrowding is a major issue in many poorer areas.The UN estimates that 69% of urban residents in the country live in slum conditions, with the housing shortfall of close to 18 million units.Building or buying a house is expensive. To construct a three-bedroom house costs $50,000 (\u00a338,500) compared with $36,000 in South Africa and $26,000 in India, according to the World Bank.The Centre for Affordable Housing Finance in Africa says a standard three-bedroom, middle-income apartment in urban locations in Nigeria currently costs $5,000 a year to rent or $100,000 to buy.Only about 40% of urban households can afford the cheapest newly-built house ($16,351). Although there is a general recognition that Nigeria is highly unequal, it is hard to quantify inequality because of the lack of up-to-date data, says economist Zuhumnan Dapel. But there is a wider point about the study of inequality, he says. Those in developing economies care less about income inequality than they do about living in poverty.\"Whether their people are living below the poverty line., the main aim is getting people out of poverty,\" he says.And this is where Nigeria faces its greatest challenge.According to the World Bank, Nigeria is now the country with the most poor people in the world, overtaking India.The Bank is is cautious over the reliability of the data, but it does suggest the immense scale of the problem the country is facing - whoever wins the forthcoming elections.Amendment: The Nigerian presidential election has been delayed until 23 February and this has been reflected in the article.

Officials are concerned that many long-serving staff will use the lump sum payments as an opportunity to move on. About 78% of the 2,677 home carers are in line to receive money. The council's chief social work officer has warned that up to 40% of staff could quit their posts after receiving payouts. They plan to recruit 400 new staff to fill the vacant posts.  In 2006, the council evaluated roles to ensure men and women received equal pay for jobs of the same value. Campaigners claimed traditionally female-dominated roles were paid up to \u00a33 an hour less. In a report submitted to Glasgow City's Integration Joint Board, Susanne Millar, Glasgow City Council's chief social work officer, warned officials that following the settlement pay out she anticipates up to 80% of staff in supervisory roles may hand in their notice. Officials fear that staff - many of whom have had long careers with the council - may choose to leave or retire from the service in the coming months after receiving their settlement. However, they stress that it will depend on what that settlement figure is. Ms Millar's report states: \"It is anticipated that between 18 - 40% of our home care staff may choose to leave. \"Furthermore, it is predicted that 50-80% of staff in supervisory roles who are key to the day to day planning of work, assessment and supervision of front line staff may choose to leave.\"This potential loss of staff, when considering the shift patterns and hours worked of those who may leave translates to a 38-40% loss of capacity in service.\"She adds that plans are in place to recruit 400 new home carers to mitigate the potential loss of capacity, and to offer staff who want to stay different roles or working hours to maximise retention. Over 10,000 people use the home care service every year, with carers delivering 87,000 visits a week.The average age of a service user is 81 and they typically receive of 9.5 hours of home care every week. Ms Millar's report is due to be presented to the Glasgow Health and Social Care Partnership on 27 March. A spokesman for the council said: \"We are currently understanding and planning for a potential loss of capacity in service provision as a result of the settlement of equal pay claims. \"We have an operational team looking at how we can mitigate against this situation and adapt the way we operate and deliver services, to lessen the impact. \"The precise effect on the service is uncertain at this stage but it is clearly prudent to prepare for what may lie ahead.\" The problems arose from an earlier attempt to eliminate gender pay inequality. In 2006, Glasgow City Council adopted a job evaluation scheme with the aim of ensuring that men and women received equal pay for jobs of the same value. While most local authorities adopted the \"red book\" scheme, Glasgow opted for a bespoke solution called the Workforce Pay and Benefits Review (WPBR) scheme. There are two main problems with this:Campaigners say workers in traditionally female-dominated roles such as home care or catering were paid up to \u00a33 an hour less than those in male-dominated jobs such as refuse workers or grave diggers. In 2017, two judgements at the Court of Session ruled that both the payment protection scheme and the WPBR discriminated against women workers. Thousands of council workers went on strike over the issue in October 2018.In January, the council and unions reached an agreement in principle on a package of payments to resolve unequal pay claims.It is likely the payments will total more than \u00a3500m and payments will be paid from April this year. The following month, the council approved plans to finance the settlement by selling off major venues to an arm's length body and leasing them back.The proposal involves transferring ownership of prominent buildings such as the Riverside Museum and the Emirates arena to a council-owned body.It will take out long-term loans against the value of the venues.They will then be rented back to the council with the cost of the lease designed to meet the loan repayments.","26":"Canadian couple Kevin and Julia Garratt were detained in China in 2014 and accused of spying. Amid an escalating feud between Canada and China and allegations of retaliatory detentions, the pair tells the BBC about what it was like - and how they ever made it home. Kevin Garratt remembers well the night he and Julia were arrested in north-eastern China. He recalls being pulled away from his wife as they walked through a restaurant's downstairs lobby, and pushed into the back of a black sedan filled with burly officers. He thought the whole thing was some terrible mistake. Julia, forced into a separate sedan, found herself shaking in fear and shock at the sudden turn of events, and the drive in the darkness. She thought: \"This is going to be my last night. \"I don't think I've ever felt that level of fear and panic before. And also just sad for my family and my children, because there was no warning, there would be no chance to say goodbye.\" The Garratts had lived in China since 1984, and from 2008 operated a coffee house popular with Western expats and tourists in Dandong, a city on the North Korean border, while continuing to carry out Christian aid work.But unbeknownst to either of them, early in 2014 and thousands of miles away, American authorities were launching a crackdown on Chinese cyber-espionage. One of the men in their sights was Su Bin, a Chinese resident working in Canada. That June, Canadian authorities picked up Su, accused of stealing data about military projects and selling it to China, for extradition to the US. While China has denied it, Canadian officials and observers believed the Garratts' arrest was a tit-for-tat detention and an attempt to pressure Canada for Su's release. Canada's ambassador in Beijing at the time, Guy Saint-Jacques, describes them as \"a couple of Canadian missionaries who had been in China 30 years doing good work\". He tells the BBC their arrest \"was the first case where we saw a clear retaliation for something that had happened in Canada\". When he met counterparts at the foreign ministry about the case, Saint-Jacques recalls: \"They never said directly 'let's do a swap.' But it was very clear what they wanted.\" On the night of the Garratts' arrest - the beginning of months of detention for the pair - they had been invited for dinner by a friend of a friend, who told the couple they wanted to talk about their daughter going to study in Canada. But something about the dinner felt strange.\"It didn't seem genuine, and the daughter never came,\" Kevin says. Julia says it was only later they realised the whole evening had been a set-up for their arrest. \"It was very carefully thought through and planned in advance. We had no idea,\" she says. Parts of the couple's story could be pulled directly from today's headlines. In December, Chinese telecoms executive Meng Wanzhou, 46, was detained in Vancouver for allegedly breaking US sanctions against Iran. This week, the US filed charges against  Huawei and Meng, and the US is seeking her extradition.  Both Huawei and Meng have rejected the allegations. Following Meng's arrest came threats of \"grave consequences\" from China if the tech heiress and chief finance officer at Huawei, China's largest private company, was not released. In mid-December, two Canadian men - former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor - were held in China on accusations of harming national security.Like in the Garratts' case, their detention is seen by many China analysts as a reprisal. The Garratts' experience in detention parallels what Canadian officials and others have suggested that Kovrig and Spavor are living through - daily interrogations, being kept in a room with lights on day and night. \"I don't know what they did or didn't do, but I know what they're going through right now,\" says Julia. The Garratts say they were never physically harmed but were watched by guards around the clock, and had to request the most basic necessities when they needed them. \"You want a drink of water, they have to go get it for it. Brush your teeth, they get it for you. It's really meant to frighten and control you,\" says Kevin. Julia says the first few nights, she put a blanket over her eyes to block the light, but the guard pulled it down.  \"I thought: 'That's a rule, I can't cover my face to sleep in the dark, they need the lights shining in my face.' They had very strict protocol.\" They also experienced daily interrogations for up to six hours. Their interrogators had a decade of details about their time in China and their travels, and asked over and over about the minutia of their activities - the why, the when, and the where. Whom they met. \"They would ask the same questions two month later and compare the answers,\" says Julia. \"It's very, very gruelling.\" Some four years later, they have documented their experience in a book, Two Tears on the Window, published in November. Devout Christians, they say prayer and the support of both their close family and the wider church community helped them through their time in detention. \"I had the sense that my peace cannot be stolen from me, my true freedom cannot be stolen from me. And I think there was great comfort in that,\" says Julia. She was released on bail in February 2015, pending trial. In January 2016, still in detention, Kevin was charged with stealing state secrets. A month later, Su waived extradition and headed to the US, where in March he pleaded guilty to hacking into major US defence contractors, stealing sensitive military data and sending it to China.Saint-Jacques says that Chinese officials seemed taken by surprise by Su's decision to cut a deal with American officials. He believes that turn of events, combined with a visit to China by Justin Trudeau, during which the newly elected PM raised Kevin's case, were instrumental in securing Kevin's release. He was deported to Canada in September 2016 after 775 days in detention, and reunited with Julia, who had left the country earlier that year. Meanwhile, Meng's case continues to strain China's ties with Canada and the US. Chinese officials have called her arrest  a \"serious mistake\", accusing Canada of double standards and \"Western egotism and white supremacy\". She is out on bail and under house arrest in Vancouver, where she owns property. She is next due in court on 6 March, but the case could possibly drag on for years. It also comes amid growing scrutiny in Western countries over Huawei, which is a world leader in telecoms infrastructure, in particular the next generation of mobile phone networks, known as 5G.Concern about the security of the company's technology has been growing, particularly in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and Germany, which fear its products could be used for spying, an allegation which Huawei denies. Amid the diplomatic dispute, Canada has worked to rally international allies to its corner. Earlier this month, over 140 diplomats - including Saint-Jacques - and academics signed an open letter to President Xi Jinping calling for the release of Kovrig and Spavor. Canada also fired ambassador John McCallum on Sunday following controversial comments he made about Meng's extradition case. For the Garratts, despite the international significance of cases such as theirs, it's important to remember that individuals and their families have got caught up in the dispute. \"The human cost is huge. That's the largest cost that's paid by the individuals that are directly implicated, unjustly implicated by these big things,\" she says.  ","27":"Saudi Arabia \"seriously curtailed and undermined\" Turkey's ability to investigate the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a UN expert has said.A preliminary report says it was 13 days before Turkey was allowed into the consulate where the journalist was killed.Khashoggi was last seen alive entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. The 59-year-old was a prominent critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.US officials have reportedly said such an operation would have needed the prince's approval. But Saudi officials insist he was murdered by a \"rogue\" team of Saudi agents not acting on Prince Mohammed's orders.The country has put 11 people on trial for the murder and is seeking the death penalty for five of them.Saudi Arabia has refused to extradite its citizens to Turkey after the country issued arrest warrants for several Saudi officials. UN Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard, who is leading an international human rights inquiry into the murder, visited Turkey between 28 January and 3 February. The preliminary report on the inquiry says Khashoggi \"was the victim of a brutal and premeditated killing, planned and perpetrated by officials of the State of Saudi Arabia\".Turkey's ability to investigate this murder though was \"seriously curtailed and undermined by Saudi Arabia's unwillingness, for some 13 days, to allow Turkish investigators access to the crime scenes.\"While the murder took place on 2 October, authorities only got access to the consulate on 15 October, and not to the residence there until 17 October - which in particular affected the forensic investigation, she wrote. Ms Callamard also attacked Saudi Arabia's trial of 11 suspects in the case, saying it raises \"major concerns\" about transparency and fairness.\"I have requested an official country visit to Saudi Arabia so that the authorities there can directly provide me with relevant evidence,\" she wrote.

Saudi Deputy Public Prosecutor Shalaan bin Rajih Shalaan said investigators had concluded an intelligence officer ordered Khashoggi's murder, applying a lethal injection inside the consulate.The officer had been tasked with persuading the dissident journalist to return to the Gulf kingdom, he added.Khashoggi's body was dismembered inside the building and the body parts were then handed over to a local \"collaborator\" outside the grounds, according to Mr Shalaan.At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Saudi finance minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan told delegates the country was \"absolutely sad about what happened to Jamal Khashoggi\".Turkey meanwhile has identified 15 men it believes to be Saudi agents arriving at and departing from Istanbul's international airport around the time of the killing.It is unknown if any are now on trial in Riyadh.The US has imposed sanctions on 17 Saudi officials, including Saud al-Qahtani, a former adviser to the crown prince who it alleged was \"part of the planning and execution of the operation\" that led to Khashoggi's murder. It is unclear if any of the 17 are on trial.","28":"There is no evidence higher tuition fees have deterred young people in England from applying to university, says Education Secretary Damian Hinds.He said applications, including from disadvantaged youngsters, had risen despite fees rising to \u00a39,250 per year.This is despite a review, commissioned by the prime minister, being expected to call for a significant cut in fees.But Mr Hinds said the student finance system was \"very progressive\" and should not put off young people.The education secretary has written to the higher education regulator, the Office for Students, calling for greater efforts to ensure university access for people from all backgrounds and parts of the country.At the moment, Mr Hinds said, young people from London were five times more likely to get into selective universities than their counterparts in the North East.He highlighted the need for white, working class youngsters to have fair access to universities, along with other disadvantaged groups.But he rejected the idea that tuition fees could be a barrier.\"The evidence suggests they aren't,\" said Mr Hinds.He said there had been predictions that there would be a drop in applications and take-up of university places after fees had been trebled in 2012.But, he said, applications had continued to rise and the system of fees, loans and repayments should not be seen as a reason not to go to university.The education secretary's defence of fees comes ahead of the findings of a review chaired by Philip Augar, commissioned by the government, which is expected to recommend a reduction in tuition fees.It follows suggestions that students, currently graduating with debts averaging \u00a350,000, should have to borrow less to go to university.It was also a response to Labour's promise at the last general election to entirely scrap tuition fees.The OFS has been told by the education secretary to ensure universities make \"greater and faster progress\" in helping more young people from \"under-represented groups\" to get into higher education.But Mr Hinds said that expanding the numbers of disadvantaged students would not mean reducing the numbers of applicants from wealthier families.\"This is not about saying fewer children from any one particular background - it's about saying whatever their background, you should look at the potential of these young people,\" he said.But the regulator has said that if all young people went to university at the same rate as the wealthiest, Russell Group universities would need to have twice as many places.It is establishing a What Works Centre to find successful approaches to widening access and wants universities to eradicate \"equality gaps\" in recruitment within the next 20 years.Mr Hinds said \u00a3860m was currently being spent on widening participation, including funding from tuition fees and the taxpayer.But there needed to be more clarity about what was effective and provided value for money.OFS fair access director Chris Millward said: \"A huge amount of time, money and resources are already invested in access and participation.\"But there is a lack of understanding about what works and staff working at the coal face have been calling for a central place for evidence on effective approaches to be systematically gathered and shared. \"The evidence and impact exchange will meet this need, improving outcomes for students and providing better value for money on the investments that are made.\"Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: \"Urgent action is required to ensure that our universities are open to talented students regardless of their background. \"A Labour government will scrap tuition fees, restore maintenance grants for disadvantaged students and fundamentally overhaul the Office for Students so that our education system serves the public good.\"","29":"Controversy is never far from the Kardashian family.But it's not babies or boyfriends grabbing the headlines this time, but Kylie Jenner's new status as the world's youngest self-made billionaire.Jenner, who has earned a 10-figure fortune aged 21, gained global recognition in her family's reality TV show Keeping Up with the Kardashians.Though Jenner has made her fortune with her best-selling beauty business, Kylie Cosmetics, some have questioned whether her money can really be 'self-made', since she comes from such a privileged background.Jenner welcomed her billionaire status with a post on Instagram thanking Forbes for the recognition. thank you @forbes \ud83d\udc9cA post shared by  Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Mar 5, 2019 at 1:23pm PSTEnd of Instagram post  by kyliejennerShe's also defended the notion that she's \"self-made\", telling Paper Magazine last month that none of her money is inherited.In that interview, Jenner said \"the self-made thing is true\". She claims her parents, Kris and Caitlyn Jenner, cut her off at the age of 15 and told her to start making her own fortune.Jenner, who stars in the reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians, continued: \"What I'm trying to say is I did have a platform, but none of my money is inherited.\"Forbes has also weighed in on the issue, saying: \"To be clear, Forbes defines \"self-made\" as someone who built a company or established a fortune on her own, rather than inheriting some or all of it.\"The magazine has devised a scale ranking how truly self-made a business person is.  On Forbes' scale, media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who was born poor, scored a 10. Jenner, who has benefitted from being born into a famous, wealthy family, scored seven.Bybreen Samuels, author of the business book Non-Profit Booster - 10 Steps to Building a Successful Organisation, believes \"describing Kylie Jenner as a 'self-made billionaire' is a misnomer\" because \"at no time has she faced true entrepreneurial challenges\".Samuels adds Jenner's journey to becoming a billionaire is in stark contrast with that of Sara Blakely, who used all her $5,000 (\u00a33800) savings to launch the slimming knickers Spanx. Forbes named Blakely the youngest self-made female billionaire in 2012, at the age of 41.Samuels tells BBC News of Jenner: \"She gained leverage by using her family name, fame and wealth. Consequently, she had direct access to the whole range of privileges, connections and resources that flow from these factors. \"Her ascendancy into global wealth and brand recognition was already guaranteed before she even started.\"Predictably, given Jenner's background, opinions on social media about her 'self-made' status are split.Jenner was 10 years old when she made her debut on her family's reality TV series. A decade on, she's the famous family's highest earner.Freelance beauty journalist Jessica Morgan says Jenner's achievement shouldn't be underestimated.\"If Jenner hadn't come from a famous family, perhaps she wouldn't have been named the world's youngest billionaire so quickly,\" she tells BBC News.\"But that's not to say she wouldn't have achieved such an accolade in her lifetime.\"Five facts about Kylie Jenner's businessMorgan continues: \"On average, it takes a millionaire 14 years to reach billionaire status while the average age to hit this status is 37. \"It took Microsoft's Bill Gates five years to reach billionaire status, while Amazon's Jeff Bezos was crowned a billionaire after two years.\"I'm really happy for Kylie and I'm excited to see what else she has in store for us.\" With more than 175 million followers across Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter, social media has been the key to Jenner's success. So influential is she, that she wiped $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) off Snap's stock market value after tweeting that she no longer used its Snapchat messaging app.In May 2018, People reported that Jenner is the most valuable celebrity on Instagram, with each of her sponsored posts valued at around $1m (\u00a3750,000) in traditional advertising spending.Morgan says beauty brands that use social media effectively can achieve huge success: \"Emily Weiss built her beauty empire off the back of her blog, Into The Gloss, which garnered a huge following and subsequently led to Weiss launching Glossier.\"Jenner and Weiss both have one thing in common: they built their businesses using social media as a free marketing tool and it has worked.

It follows a BBC investigation showing falls of between 30 and 50% since 2013 in the numbers taking language GCSEs in some areas of England.Head teachers warned the aim might not be realistic because of teacher shortages and funding pressures. Ministers said the picture in England had improved slightly since 2010. This improvement in the overall proportion taking a language GCSE, thanks largely to Spanish and Mandarin, hides a collapse in numbers studying German and French.Between 2010 and 2018 in England, the numbers of German GCSEs fell from 57,806 to 39,941 and at A-level from 5,055 to 2,785, according to the Department for Education.The all-party parliamentary group on modern languages called for cross-government action in a recovery plan published on Monday.Jean Coussins, a crossbench peer and joint chair of the group, said: \"We are complacent.  In the 21st Century speaking only English, is as much of a disadvantage as speaking no English at all.\"The report pointed towards a declining proportion of online content in English, and said that according to the British Council, 75% of the world's population does not speak English. The group is calling for a range of new qualifications, amid concerns that it is seen as harder to get a good grade in GCSEs than other subjects. \"One of myths we need to bust is [that] languages are just for the top set,\" said Baroness Coussins, pointing out that in a number of other countries the expectation is that everyone can learn another language. But Geoff Barton, from the Association of School and College Leaders, said that while head teachers supported the ambition to encourage language learning, it was important to be realistic. He said given funding constraints and the difficulty in recruiting specialist teachers, \"it is hard to see how schools could fulfil an objective to ensure all young people learn a language from ages five to 18\".The plan also suggests tax breaks for smaller businesses as part of promoting life-long learning of languages. Baroness Coussins said: \"We're at a crunch point. When we're faced with the practical challenge of negotiating dozens of new free trade agreements, we'll discover speaking English is not enough.\"That call was backed by Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce.He said: \"Language skills lead to a better understanding of how people and cultures operate, and that understanding is often the key to closing a business deal.\"The German Ambassador to the UK, Peter Wittig, expressed his dismay in a tweet following the BBC's report last week.In response to the parliamentary recovery plan Mr Wittig told the BBC that the decline in Britons learning German was \"deeply worrying\".He added: \"Speaking languages and engaging with other cultures are the currency of the 21st century. \"In today's inter-connected world, communicators and bridge-builders are needed as never before.\"The German ambassador said not only did learning a language open doors in fields from finance to engineering, but it \"encourages friendship, trust and understanding across borders\".Last week, the Minister for Schools Standards in England, Nick Gibb, said that since 2010, the proportion of children taking a language at GCSE had risen from 40% to 46% in 2018.He said the government was \"determined to see this rise further\", and was taking a range of measures to tackle this - such as creating a new network of schools that excel in the teaching of languages to share their expertise and best practice with others.","31":"A third of UK students have gone without heating or running water in their properties, a survey has suggested.The state of accommodation is among a list of 10 biggest concerns among young tenants, the survey of 2,196 students by website Save the Student suggests.But noisy housemates remains the biggest gripe in the annual survey.It also highlights concerns about the cost of living away from home for the first time.The findings suggested that typical upfront costs, including fees, the deposit, and a month's rent in advance, totalled \u00a3970.Average rent stood at about \u00a3125 a week, of which parents contribute an average of \u00a344. One in five students receive more than \u00a3100 a week from parents to help cover the cost.  Two in five turned to overdrafts, loans, and credit cards to pay the rental bill, Save the Student said.Previous research by student housing charity Unipol and the National Union of Students suggested that the average price of student accommodation in the UK had risen by nearly a third in six years.About 30% of those asked had started to look for the following academic year's lodgings by November in an attempt to find a decent deal and to spread the cost over time.In addition to the cost, poor conditions in student accommodation were a major concern.One student in Portsmouth said that on the day she moved in there was no front door on the property and there was no heating for two months. Another in Newcastle said she had no hot water for the entire year.\"I had to boil the kettle and fill up the sink that way to wash my face,\" she said.Damp, a lack of water or heating, disruptive building work, and rodents and pests all featured in the top 10 list of complaints, according to the Save the Student survey.Jake Butler, from Save the Student, said: \"Too many people - including students - seem to believe that poor living conditions are just a part of student life.\"While the laws around renting are constantly improving there needs to be a much easier way for students to report and resolve problems with their accommodation.\"Updated legislation, which takes effect on 20 March, is designed to ensure that all rented accommodation is fit for human habitation and strengthens tenants' means of redress against landlords who fail to keep their properties safe.","32":"President Donald Trump's former lawyer has made a series of allegations about his former boss. Politically embarrassing, yes. But how much legal jeopardy? Jonathan Turley, professor of constitutional law at George Washington University, gives his view.\"Let me... introduce myself.\"  Those words by Michael Cohen may have been the least needed portion of his testimony. He is truly a man who needs no introduction. What he needs is a reputation. Well, a good reputation anyway.  Trump's fixer was appearing less than 24 hours after being disbarred as a lawyer and a few weeks before he goes to jail for three years.  While Cohen tried to portray himself as the redemptive sinner, few who knew Cohen bought the act. Cohen is a serial liar and thug-for-hire whose lack of legal skill was only surpassed by his lack of legal ethics.  His testimony seemed to flail madly in every direction. He called Trump \"a racist\", \"a conman,\" and \"a cheat\". He was eager to recount how Trump lied about bone spurs to get out of Vietnam. He then reminded everyone that Trump attacked a real war hero, John McCain, for getting captured. He worked in how Trump got him to lie to the First Lady about his affairs.It was riveting but largely irrelevant to the criminal allegations. The Republicans and the White House worked hard to establish the obvious - that Cohen is a convicted perjurer and con man.  Cohen is no daisy but he can still be a danger. He brought documents, including cheques signed by Trump, to bolster his claims of a pattern of criminal and dishonest practices. Virtually all of these allegations were far removed from the collusion allegations that led to the special counsel investigation and concerned Trump's businesses.Most of the examples that Cohen gave of Trump lying about his affairs or wealth or dealings were gratuitous and immaterial to criminal charges. It is not a crime to lie to the public or the media. If it were, most of the members of the committee would be serving time next to Trump.  One disclosure described as a \"bombshell\" was Cohen recounting that he heard Trump confidante Roger Stone tell Trump over the phone that he had spoken to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and that WikiLeaks was about to dump a massive number of hacked emails related to Hillary Clinton and her campaign. Stone and WikiLeaks deny this account. However, the real problem is the date. Cohen said that this occurred just before the Democratic National Convention. That would put the call from mid- to late July 2016. However, WikiLeaks was already known to have the emails and was publicly teasing their release at least a month before.  Moreover, there is nothing criminal in Stone or Trump wanting to see the emails or relishing their release. Cohen's account of Trump's delight at the news is hardly surprising - he publicly called on the Russians to release any hacked emails.  Moreover, Trump was not the only one seeking dirt from foreign sources. While the campaign falsely denied funding the controversial \"Steele dossier\", Clinton's campaign later admitted that it paid a former British spy to gather information on Trump from foreign sources, including Russian intelligence.Indeed, Cohen expressly said that he had no evidence of collusion with the Russians.Cohen also repeated his allegation that Trump encouraged him to arrange for the payment of hush money to a Playboy model and a porn star to bury news of his affairs.  Cohen showed up bearing cheques with Trump's signature - signed when he was president and still denying prior knowledge of the payments. This could amount to a campaign finance violation, but such violations are rarely charged as criminal matters and have had mixed success in prosecutions. Where Cohen may have caused new problems for Trump was his accounting of dishonest business practices from using his charity to pay portraits of himself for his own benefit or misrepresenting assets in communications with insurance companies and banks. This included a curious series of asset reports that Cohen said were given to Deutsche Bank in a move to acquire the Buffalo Bills NFL team. Trump's stated value seemed to jump from $4.56bn in 2012 to $8.66bn in 2013. It is not clear what that asset increase was based on and whether the figures were put into any formal loan documents. However, any misrepresentation of wealth and liabilities can form the basis of bank fraud allegations. What is clear is that Trump is looking at a growing threat not from the special counsel's investigation into Russian collusion, but the investigation into his business practices by the US Attorney in the Southern District of New York.And attacking Cohen's lack of credibility will not change bank records.  Trump has been quoted about his respect for Roy Cohn, who was the right-hand man to Joe McCarthy during the \"Red Scare\" period. He was widely viewed as an unethical and vile human being. He was also Trump's lawyer. In March 2016, Trump reportedly asked in frustration: \"Where's my Roy Cohn?\" That man would prove to be Michael Cohen who had the same sense of freedom from rules of ethics or law. Like Cohn, Cohen was known to threaten and bully people into submission. Like Cohn, Cohen would be disbarred for his unethical acts.  Many believe that Cohn was the person who taught Trump to never admit fault and always counterpunch. Cohn once said: \"I bring out the worst in my enemies and that's how I get them to defeat themselves.\" In the end, Cohn died a disbarred lawyer being pursued by the IRS for millions. Cohen is now a disbarred lawyer who is going to prison for, among other things, five counts of tax evasion. Of course, Trump has no need to ask \"where's my Michael Cohen\" in the coming months. He will be in the federal penitentiary.After the hearing in the House Oversight Committee, Democratic Chairman Elijah Cummings stated that he now believes that Trump not only committed crimes but \"it appears that [Trump] did\" commit crimes in office.  If true, Trump may be not only looking at a political push for impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives. But criminal charges after he leaves office.Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University and served as the last lead defence counsel in an impeachment in the US Senate","33":"Consumers who have been tricked into authorising bank payments to fraudsters are more likely to be reimbursed by their bank in future thanks to new rules agreed by the industry.Customers have lost millions of pounds through this type of scam, known as \"push\" or \"authorised\" payment fraud.Previously, because the payments were approved by victims, they were less likely to receive compensation.Now banks and building societies have agreed to do more to protect customers.Examples of authorised payment fraud include fraudsters posing as builders, solicitors, or other contractors who have carried out work for the victim. They submit a fake invoice containing the fraudster's bank details and it is often not easy to spot that they are not the legitimate payee.UK Finance, the group representing UK banks, said that in the first half of 2018 such scams cost consumers \u00a392.9m.A new voluntary code, which comes into effect on 28 May, has been agreed between banks and consumer representatives and is designed to give better protection to customers and reduce the incidence of this kind of fraud.Customers will still have to have taken appropriate steps to make sure the person they paid was not a scammer, but if they have taken reasonable care, then they will now be much more likely to be reimbursed.\"It is vital that we get the right outcome for customers and prevent the UK from inadvertently becoming a magnet for fraudsters,\" said Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance.The industry has committed to funding compensation until the end of this year \"in those situations where both the customer and their payment service provider met the required standards set out in the code\". After January 2020 a more permanent funding arrangement is expected. 'Tough issue'Hannah Nixon, managing director for the Payment Systems Regulator, the body which facilitated the new voluntary code said consumers would now receive better protection.\"We're particularly pleased that the steering group has been able to navigate and agree a way to reimburse victims when neither victim nor bank has done anything wrong,\" she said.\"This was a tough issue that rightly involved much discussion, but the banks have done the right thing for their customers in backing this measure.\" Which?, the consumer group that highlighted the lack of protection for bank customers two years ago, welcomed the new code as \"a significant step\".However, Gareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, said: \"It will only be judged a success if the action taken by banks results in fewer scams and if all victims are treated fairly and reimbursed swiftly.\"It is now vital that all banks, building societies and other payment service providers sign up to the voluntary code and ensure that victims are not forced to clear unreasonable hurdles to prove they are not at fault when they have been targeted by fraudsters.\"The banks must also ensure a long-term funding solution is in place by 1st January 2020, so there can never be a return to the days when people were losing life-changing sums of money through no fault of their own.\" ","34":"The system allowing people to use cash in the UK is at risk of \"falling apart\" and needs a new guarantee to ensure notes and coins can still be used.A hard-hitting review by finance experts has concluded that market forces will not save cash for as long as people need it.The report calls on the government and regulators to step in to ensure cash remains viable.Suggestions include ensuring rural shops offer cash-back.The report also said that essential services, such as utility and council bills, should still allow customers to pay in cash.An independent body, funded by the banks, should be set up that would step in if local communities were running short of access to cash in shops and ATMs, the report said.The research - called the Access to Cash Review - is authored by former financial ombudsman Natalie Ceeney and was paid for by cash machine network operator Link, but was independent from it. It took evidence from nearly 100 businesses and charities across the UK.Cash use has been falling dramatically in recent years. In 2017, debit card use - driven by contactless payments - overtook the number of payments made in cash in the UK for the first time.The report said that the current rate of decline would mean cash use would end in 2026.However, it concluded that notes and coins would still be used in 15 years' time, but accounting for between 10% and 15% of transactions.The demise of cash, if unchecked, would be driven primarily by retailers and other businesses refusing to accept cash owing to the cost of handling it.Mike Keen opened The Boot pub in Freston, near Ipswich, last year as a cashless business with no tills.\"There are a whole bunch of reasons. The [biggest] gain is management time,\" he said, such as never having to cash up at the end of the day, drive to the bank and queue to pay it in, two or three times a week.He said that saved the business 15 hours a week, and many thousands of pounds. Insurance premiums had been lower as there was no cash on the premises, security was less of a problem, and the time taken to serve customers was much quicker, he said.Banknotes and coins are a necessity for eight million people, according to the review's interim findings published in December.These include rural communities where alternative ways of paying are affected by poor broadband or mobile connectivity, and many people who have physical or mental health problems and therefore find it hard to use digital services.The report also concludes that vulnerability in this area is generally the result of income, not old age.\"Poverty is the biggest indicator of cash dependency, not age,\" the review concludes. \"There are worrying signs that our cash system is falling apart. ATM and bank branch closures are just the tip of the iceberg, underneath there is a huge infrastructure which is becoming increasingly unviable as cash use declines,\" Ms Ceeney said. \"If we sleepwalk into a cashless society, millions will be left behind.\" Kev Jackson has been homeless and currently lives in temporary accommodation. \"Cash is easy because you know what you have got on you,\" he said. \"On a card - when you can't see your balance - it is easy to overspend. [Cash] is very good for budgeting.\"\"A lot of people [on the streets] do not have bank accounts, so they only carry cash. If you can't spend cash in a shop, it is going to be difficult for them. They won't be able to survive.\"He said that he preferred using a card himself, but was concerned that technology left many people behind. Evidence from Sweden, seen as much closer to a cashless society than the UK, suggested that infrastructure was needed before cash use declined beyond anyone's control.The review suggested that an independent body was needed to oversee a guarantee that people need not travel too far to get access to cash.Innovation should also be used to protect cash, such as: Britain's cash infrastructure costs around \u00a35bn a year to run. It is paid for predominantly by the retail banks and run mostly by commercial operators. The Bank of England's chief cashier, Sarah John, said it would call together key players in this sector to develop a system that would support lower levels of cash use and encourage innovation \"to support cash as a viable means of payment for those who want to use it\".Consumer group Which? has called for a single regulator to have a statutory duty to protect access to cash and build a sustainable cash infrastructure for the UK. Eric Leenders, from UK Finance, which represents banks, said: \"The finance industry is using a range of solutions to ensure cash can still be accessed including over the counter withdrawals through 11,500 Post Offices and cash-back from retailers, to investment in ATMs and mobile bank branches to reach more rural communities.\"We will continue to work with the review team, government, and regulators to take forward this important work.\"Ron Delnevo, of the ATM Industry Association, said that there should be a requirement, backed by law, on businesses to accept cash, mirroring moves by some local authorities in the US.","35":"Finance apps are proving increasingly popular, but are they making us better at managing our money or encouraging us to spend more?Kerry Hudson, 28, spent her childhood living in poverty in Scotland with her single mother, in \"a succession of council estates, bed and breakfasts for the homeless, and caravan parks\".She lived in seven different places before she was 15, and attended 14 schools.  \"I was always the new girl with the weird accent and the wrong, cheap clothes,\" she recalls. \"I was bullied every single day of secondary school.\"She found solace in books and the peace of the library, eventually growing up to become a prizewinning writer. Her most recent book, Lowborn, is about people growing up without money. But although her childhood experiences gave her a constant, gnawing fear of slipping back into poverty, Kerry found managing her finances difficult.She says she was \"perpetually running out\" of money before payday, \"because I wasn't keeping track, which is obviously OK when there is a payday but you can't do that when you're freelance.\"So she sought help in the form of a money app from Revolut, the financial technology start-up currently under fire for an insensitive marketing campaign. \"It gives me a breakdown of what I've spent and, if it is often far too much in coffee shops where I primarily work, I know I've got to be more careful the following week,\" she says. When budgeting, she says, \"I put a certain amount on [the card] each week and stick to that.\" The app also has an automatic saving facility and free cash withdrawals abroad (up to \u00a3200 a month).Global downloads of finance apps hit 3.4 billion in 2018 - that's 75% more than three years ago, says Silicon Valley analytics company App Annie.Their popularity is growing fastest in emerging-market countries, such as Brazil, India and Indonesia. And making it easier to send money to other people seems to be a major reason for their popularity in these countries.The world's three most downloaded money apps in 2018 - India's Google Pay and PhonePe, and China's Alipay - as well as China's WeChat, all focus on money sending as a core function.\"I get instant notification, it informs whoever's receiving a payment that it's sent, and conversation is driving payment,\" says Rachna Ahlawat, co-founder of Ondot, an app that lets users switch credit and debit cards on and off.In the US, 92% of 18 to 37-year-olds use finance apps, says Dr Annamaria Lusardi at the George Washington University School of Business, mostly to track spending and pay bills.But are these apps changing how we spend and save? Comprehensive evidence is hard to come by, but Reykjavik-based Georg Ludviksson, chief executive of fintech firm Meniga, says people who start using finance apps spend 7% less on average in the following six to 12 months.But he admits that simply cutting up your credit cards can have a more dramatic effect on your spending. His company is developing personalised banking apps for banks such as Spain's Santander, Sweden's Skandiabanken, and the Netherlands' ING Direct.Regularly seeing where our money goes seems key to successful budgeting.\"If you're constantly reminded how much you've already spent, it becomes more painful to pay for the next item,\" according to Rufina Gafeeva in Cologne, who researches how technology changes our spending behaviour.But if payment apps just make spending money easier, with less emphasis on budget management, we can end up spending more than we did before we started using the app, she warns. Just think of the speed and convenience of contactless payment. Nearly a third of 18 to 37-year-olds in the US who use mobile payment apps have at some point become overdrawn, says Dr Lusardi, compared with only a fifth of non-app users.\"What's the point where convenience becomes dangerous?\" asks Steve Tigar, chief executive of Money Dashboard, a popular financial management app. \"Does Apple Pay take you to a point of convenience where it's just so easy to throw away money?\"I'm not sure, but either you completely reject it and don't take part in the digital economy, or you embrace it and have a safety net that allows you to monitor your money really, really well.\"Money Dashboard makes your past spending more apparent by letting you see all your bank and credit card accounts in one place, and categorising your transactions to show you on what you spend the most.An equivalent in the US and Canada is Mint.com. It helps you make a budget and track your spending against it.\"The better [money apps] are trying to be like Facebook,\" says Meniga's Georg Ludviksson.\"You read through your feed, your transactions might be there, but also some insight and nudges about what you're spending money on,\" he says. More Technology of BusinessIf your Starbucks habit is getting out of control, for example, the app will warn you.Behavioural economists from Harvard Business School and the University of Edinburgh found that people using Money Dashboard \"were saving about 40% of discretionary spend, about \u00a310 per log-in,\" says Mr Tigar.\"[There's a] correlation between people regularly logging in and their ability to stick to a budget,\" he says.In Europe, the 2015 Payment Services Directive (or PSD2), was supposed to foster innovation by giving approved start-ups access to your banking data. But banks have been slow in providing interfaces for tech firms, claims Mr Tigar, and this has frustrated many start-ups. \"There's really little variation in [banks'] core products, so very little incentive for consumers to switch, and then this doesn't breed innovation,\" he says. And as personal debt levels continue to rise around the world, it seems money apps can cut both ways.They can make us more aware of how much we're spending and what on, helping us to stick to a budget, but the convenience of contactless payment could also be encouraging us to spend even more.","36":"Apple has unveiled its new TV streaming platform, Apple TV+, at a star-studded event in California.Jennifer Aniston, Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey were among those who took to the stage at Apple's headquarters to reveal their involvement in TV projects commissioned by the tech giant.The platform will include shows from existing services like Hulu and HBO.Apple also announced that it would be launching a credit card, gaming portal and enhanced news app.The event was held in California and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook was clear from the start that the announcements would be about new services, not new devices.It is a change of direction for the 42-year-old company.There had been much anticipation about Apple's predicted foray into the TV streaming market, dominated by the likes of Amazon and Netflix.The Apple TV+ app was unveiled by Steven Spielberg and will launch in the autumn. Spielberg will himself be creating some material for the new platform, he said.Other stars who took to the stage included Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, Jason Momoa, Alfre Woodard, comedian Kumail Nanjiani and Big Bird from Sesame Street.The app will be made available on rival devices for the first time, coming to Samsung, LG, Sony and Vizio smart TVs as well as Amazon's Firestick and Roku.The subscription fee was not announced, and notably absent from the launch line-up was Netflix, which had already ruled itself out of being part of the bundle.\"The test for Apple will be, can new content separate them out from their competitors and can they commission and deliver on fresh new content that can reach audiences in the same way that Stranger Things has for Netflix for example?\" commented Dr Ed Braman, an expert in film and production at the University of York.The Apple Card credit card will launch in the US this summer.There will be both an iPhone and physical version of the card, with a cashback incentive on every purchase.The credit card will have no late fees, annual fees or international fees, said Apple Pay VP Jennifer Bailey.It has been created with the help of Goldman Sachs and MasterCard.The firm also revealed a news service, Apple News+, which will include more than 300 magazine titles including Marie Claire, Vogue, New Yorker, Esquire, National Geographic and Rolling Stone.The LA Times and the Wall Street Journal will also be part of the platform, the firm said.It added that it will not track what users read or allow advertisers to do so.Apple News+ will cost $9.99 (\u00a37.50) per month and is available immediately in the US and Canada. It will come to Europe later in the year.Unlike TV+, the news platform will only be available on Apple devices.A new games platform, Apple Arcade, will offer over 100 exclusive games from the app store which will all be playable offline, in contrast with Google's recently announced streaming platform Stadia.It will be rolled out across 150 countries in the autumn but no subscription prices were given. in 2018 analyst firm IHS Markit valued the global gaming market on iOS, Apple's operating system, at $33.5bn.There is space within that market for a platform like Apple Arcade which is not financed by in-app purchases or advertising, said IHS director of games research Piers Harding-Rolls.\"Apple's decision to move up the games value chain with a new, curated subscription service and to support the development of exclusive games for its Arcade platform is a significant escalation of the company's commitment to the games market,\" he said. \"Apple joins the other technology companies Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Amazon and others in investing directly in games content and services.\"Apple is making an aggressive push into several markets in which, thanks to sheer scale alone, it immediately becomes a massive player.Its TV service has been long in the making, and Apple has amassed a roster of big stars, as expected. A bigger test will be how creative those ideas will be - a lot of Netflix's success has been about finding new talent, not throwing money at already famous names. I also have reservations about how many boundaries Apple will be prepared to push with its creative endeavours: if it's as controlling with its television as it is with its brand, it will create a catalogue bereft of risk-taking.   But TV is just a small part of what Apple is going for here. It wants (and needs) to turn its devices into the portal through which you do everything else - TV\/film, gaming, reading the news... and you'd presume other things in the very near future. The announcement of a credit card shows how far Apple is prepared to go to make sure life is experienced through your iPhone. As Oprah put it on stage: \"They're in a billion pockets, y'all.\"","37":"Council tax in the Western Isles is to go up by 4.79%. The rise, agreed by the council administration for the 2019\/20 budget, is the maximum Holyrood allows. East Lothian and Midlothian councils have already announced the same rise.The council expects it to mean an increase of between 60p and \u00a31 per week for most people in the Islands. The local authority, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, said the budget was the most challenging in its history.Council leader Roddie Mackay said care home charges would rise by 3%, despite a recommendation for a bigger increase by the Integrated Joint Board (IJB) which brings together health and social care services.Mr Mackay said that since 2010 the Comhairle has had \u00a31.7m less to spend on core services.He added that while he understood that the IJB had to recover the money it spends on care homes, he did not think it was acceptable \"to move to this position in a single year\". He added: \"I would therefore propose that we agree an increase of 3% for 2019\/20. The IJB chief finance officer has confirmed that this would not directly affect their draft budget. \"In addition, I suggest we ask for a further report on increases in future years, together with their impact on the IJB financial plan.\"He said the council was reviewing services and making savings, but difficult decisions would have to be made over the next few months about economic development, bus services and waste disposal in the area. The council has, however, made big spending commitments to the Lewis Residential Care Project and to redevelop Barra's Castlebay Community School. He added that there was \"no sign\" of the \"pressure\" on budgets easing. ","38":"A senior banker at Barclays panicked at 02:00 at the peak of the 2008 banking crisis that, if the bank was nationalised, his bonus would be jeopardised, a court has heard.Barclays was among banks needing extra funding during the crisis.Roger Jenkins discussed with colleagues a plan to raise money privately, to avoid having to accept taxpayer money.A bailout deal from the government would have meant extra disclosure of executive bonuses.The bank later raised money from Middle Eastern investors and avoided a government bailout.The court heard a conversation between Barclays executives on 8 October 2008, the day the government announced \u00a350bn of taxpayers' money would be made available to bail out the banks.\"At 2 o'clock in the morning I was panicking that we were about to get nationalised and you guys must have been the same because the government would, wouldn't look kindly on compensation over a million dollars,\" said Roger Jenkins, then an executive chairman at Barclays Capital - the investment banking arm of the business.Prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office, Edward Brown QC quoted from a transcript of a telephone conversation that day between Mr Jenkins; Barclays Capital Executive Richard Boath and another senior banker at the firm, Jeff Weiss.In the conversation, the executives discuss the risk of their bonuses being disclosed, together with those of Barclays' group chief executive, John Varley, and Barclays Capital chief executive, Bob Diamond. The court heard the men's pay:\"You may think that some of these men were highly motivated to keep their jobs,\" Mr Brown QC said.In a further phone discussion the following week, 14 October, between Jenkins and Boath, Barclays group chief executive John Varley was described as being \"scared to death\" of government intervention, and Bob Diamond as \"paranoid\" and afraid of losing his job.Mr Jenkins told a colleague in July 2008 he was going to visit Sheikh Hamad, Prime Minister of Qatar, \"to eat humble pie\", Southwark Crown Court heard.The visit came as Barclays realised not enough shareholders were buying new shares to boost the bank's finances.According to a conversation between executives Roger Jenkins and Richard Boath that left it with a \"nightmare\".The fraud trial is now in its second week. It is the first criminal trial of senior UK banking executives in the wake of the financial crisis. Qatar had expected to end up with fewer shares, according to prosecutors.Because so few other shareholders had taken up their shares, Qatar would have to buy more shares under the deal struck with Barclays, leaving it with a larger proportion of the shares and a lower rate of return than expected.In a conversation at 13:52 on 16 July 2008 with Mr Boath, Mr Jenkins said: \"One is I'm going to eat humble pie and kiss arse tomorrow now at 1.30.\"Richard Boath: \"Yeah\"Roger Jenkins: \"At his house.\"Richard Boath: \"Okay. [...]\"Roger Jenkins: \"Well yeah, he's gonna\u2026 he's not gonna get the benefit of his three, three and three quarters which you wouldn't want to print anyway.\" Qatar had originally demanded a fee of 3.75%, the court heard.In an email at 14.15 on the same day, Roger Jenkins wrote to Varley, Mr Diamond and Mr Lucas notifying them of his plans to visit the Qatari leader: \"Gents\u2026 I have arranged to go to sit with hamad\u2026 so at least its face to face as it looks like he'll be a 10% holder and the outcome is something they never bargained for. We will need to co-ordinated on press as they won't want to be seen to be mugs again losing !\"Mr Jenkins flew to visit Sheikh Hamad in the South of France the following day, the jury heard.Mr Brown QC, said the evidence showed Mr Jenkins and Mr Boath knew the fee for an Advisory Services Agreement (ASA) was in fact part of the Qatari's fee for investing of 3.25%. \"The conversations on the 16 and 18 June plainly show that Mr Jenkins and Mr Boath knew that the ASA element was part of the fee for investing and couldn't reveal it,\" Mr Brown said.  John Varley, Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath have all denied conspiracy to commit fraud. The trial continues.","39":"It's the story that has dominated Donald Trump's presidency. But it's complicated. Let's take a step back.US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to sway the election in favour of Mr Trump. A special counsel has been looking into whether anyone from his campaign colluded in the effort.All we have is a summary of the conclusions, from the US attorney general. In a four-page letter to Congress, he said the special counsel found no evidence the campaign conspired with Russia. No, Attorney General Bill Barr also said there was insufficient evidence that the president obstructed justice.Yes. He had called it a witch hunt from the start.No. It was conducted by the hugely respected Robert Mueller, a Republican who used to run the FBI.There were several meetings between senior members of Mr Trump's team with Russian officials. Several meetings were not initially disclosed. Ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn lied to the FBI about meeting the Russian ambassador to the US before Mr Trump took office.The president's son, Donald Jr, met a Russian lawyer who said she had \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton during the campaign.He brought charges against several of Mr Trump's inner circle.Ex-adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his contacts with Wikileaks, which released emails belonging to Democratic officials, allegedly hacked by Russians. Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen said Mr Trump knew in advance about the email dump. Mr Cohen admitted lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax evasion and received a 36-month prison sentence. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied to the FBI about his work in Ukraine, according to special counsel Robert Mueller, with whom he had been co-operating. Manafort has been jailed for bank fraud.Since he fired the man leading one of the investigations, ex-FBI Director James Comey, there were questions about whether he obstructed justice. ","40":"Glasgow Airport bosses have called for urgent action to improve transport links with the city centre.Managing director Mark Johnston said the airport was the only one of its size in Europe reliant on road access amid worsening congestion on the M8.He is due to meet Scotland's transport secretary this week to press for progress on the issue.It comes as a new report said the airport contributed \u00a31.44bn to the economy and supported 30,000 jobs.The airport consultancy firm York Aviation also said the airport handled \u00a33.5bn in global imports and exports in 2017 and that passenger numbers were projected to almost double from 9.7 million to 17 million a year.However, bosses warned that improved transport links were crucial to its future success.The most recent plans to connect Glasgow Airport to the rail network faltered in 2017 amid concern about their economic impact to existing infrastructure.But Mr Johnston told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"We're the only airport in Europe that has road as its only means of access.\"The recent studies have shown that the congestion is only increasing on the M8. We have the funding available through the City Deal, so I think there's a genuine acceptance that something needs to happen.\"Mr Johnston said he was due to attend a meeting later this week with Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and local council leaders.He added: \"There's an acceptance now that something needs to happen. As I say, we're the only airport now without some kind of connectivity like that. We want to grow, we have plans for growth, the M8 is becoming more congested so we need action.\"The report said Glasgow Airport's contribution to the economy could rise to \u00a32.57bn by 2040 and that it had the potential to support 43,000 jobs by 2040.As part of the investment into facilities, \u00a38m is currently being invested to upgrade the airport ahead of Emirates operating a Dubai service - on the world's largest commercial aircraft, the A380 - from April.A new advanced manufacturing innovation district by the airport is also estimated to create up to 10,000 additional jobs.Two tenants have already been confirmed in the \u00a356m medical manufacturing innovation centre and the \u00a365m national manufacturing institute for Scotland.Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, also MSP for Renfrewshire North and West where the airport is based, said: \"Renfrewshire benefits hugely from having Glasgow Airport on our doorstep, forming a vital part of our local community.\"The economic growth and jobs the airport brings to the local area, and to the wider west of Scotland region, is massive and has had a huge positive knock-on effect throughout Renfrewshire and the surrounding areas.\"","41":"Almost all councils in England plan to increase council tax and many will be cutting services, research suggests.Three-quarters of local authorities are set to increase tax by more than 2.5% from April, the Local Government Information Unit (LGiU) said.It comes as almost a third of councils surveyed said they were planning to cut spending on adult social care, and a quarter may reduce children's care.The Local Government Association (LGA) said councils had \"little choice\".The survey, by the LGiU think tank and the Municipal Journal, found eight in 10 councils believe the current funding system is \"unsustainable\".The figures are based on the responses from 158 senior council figures, including leaders, chief executives and finance directors, representing 123 of the 353 English local authorities.Some 97% of local authorities surveyed were planning to raise council tax in 2019-20, but more than half (53%) still expect to have to dip into their reserves to cover costs.The average council tax for a Band D home in England was \u00a31,671 in 2018-19.A local referendum is needed to increase council tax by 3% or more in most areas. Authorities responsible for social care are allowed to increase council tax by a further 2%.Despite this, 29% of those who answered the survey said intended to \"reduce activity\" in adult social care in 2019-20.Local authorities have a legal obligation to set a balanced budget, where they do not plan to spend more than they have coming in, for the forthcoming year, beginning 1 April.The LGIU and Municipal Journal do not name the councils that are planning to raise taxes, however some councils have already held votes or confirmed their intentions publicly.They include:Some councils are also looking to increase the amount of council tax they can raise by charging more for empty homes.Owners of long-term empty homes in Manchester will be charged a higher premium on their council tax under a series of measures that could raise \u00a31m.Long-term empty homeowners already pay an extra 50% on their council tax but under proposals approved by the city council's executive, any homes empty for two years or more will be charged double council tax from April.Stockport Council has also proposed scrapping discounts on empty homes and properties under renovation.LGiU chief executive Jonathan Carr-West said councils had no option but to adopt \"drastic measures\" if they were to make ends meet.\"We know that council funding is broken. Councils are making do by increasing council tax as much as they can, increasing charging and dipping in to their reserves,\" he said.Richard Watts, the chairman of the LGA's resources board, said: \"Many councils feel they have little choice but to ask residents to pay more council tax again this year to help them try and protect their local services.\"The local referendum rule only applies in England. The National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament have the power to cap local authorities' council tax rises.Northern Ireland has a rates system instead of council tax.In Conwy in Wales, council leaders have set an increase of 9.6%, while taxpayers in Scotland, will see bills rise up to 4.79%. ","42":"The grounding of Boeing's 737 Max fleet is expected to cause little air travel disruption - at least for now.The plane-maker grounded its global fleet of the aircraft as a safety precaution after new evidence emerged about a fatal crash involving the jet. The 737 Max is flown by airlines around the world for short trips. Analysts say the initial impact of the grounded jets will be contained, but may escalate if the fleet is not permitted to fly for a longer period. The 737 Max has been the fastest-selling aircraft in Boeing's history, with more than 4,500 ordered by 100 different operators globally. But the model still only accounts for a small proportion of travel around the world. Globally, airlines were scheduled to fly just under 700,000 commercial flights this week, data from flight consultancy OAG shows. Of those, 6,548 were due to be operated by a Boeing 737 Max variant. \"We are talking about just 1% of global flights planned for the aircraft this week,\" said OAG's John Grant. The Boeing 737 Max 8 - the model involved in the Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday - is generally used for short-haul and domestic flights. Analysts say North America will face the most disruption as Southwest Airlines, Air Canada and American Airlines are the three largest operators of the 737 Max aircraft in the world.Ellis Taylor, Asia Finance Editor at Flight Global, said the grounding of the aircraft \"will have some impact\" on US schedules. Still, even if the grounded jets prompts some flight cancellations, analysts expect airlines will be able to accommodate passengers by putting them on other flights, using alternative aircraft or putting old jets back into action. \"There is plenty of capacity available globally to accommodate this capacity loss for quite a long period of time,\" OAG's Mr Grant said.  Flight Global's Mr Taylor said the scheduled 737 Max flights in the US will mostly run using other jets, but there may be \"some inconvenience over the next couple of days as the airlines implement their contingency plans\". The level of disruption will depend on how long the 737 Max aircraft are forbidden to fly. That will turn on how long the investigation into what caused the Ethiopian Airlines crash takes, and what the cause is determined to be. It could take some time. A preliminary report on the October Lion Air disaster was released about a month after the crash.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has a team investigating the Ethiopian Airlines crash site, has drawn parallels between the two disasters.Flight Global's Mr Taylor said it now looks more likely the grounding \"will extend at least a few weeks, and potentially into a few months, but it all depends on what safety issues are identified\". ","43":"Italy has become the first developed economy to sign up to China's global investment programme which has raised concerns among Italy's Western allies.A total of 29 deals amounting to \u20ac2.5bn ($2.8bn) were signed during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Rome.The project is seen as a new Silk Road which, just like the ancient trade route, aims to link China to Europe.Italy's European Union allies and the United States have expressed concern at China's growing influence.The new Silk Road has another name - the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) - and it involves a wave of Chinese funding for major infrastructure projects around the world, in a bid to speed Chinese goods to markets further afield. Critics see it as also representing a bold bid for geo-political and strategic influence.It has already funded trains, roads, and ports, with Chinese construction firms given lucrative contracts to connect ports and cities - funded by loans from Chinese banks. The levels of debt owed by African and South Asian nations to China have raised concerns in the West and among citizens - but roads and railways have been built that would not exist otherwise:On behalf of Italy, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, leader of the populist Five Star Movement, signed the umbrella deal (memorandum of intent) making Italy formally part of the Economic Silk Road and The Initiative for a Maritime Silk Road for the 21st Century.Ministers then signed deals over energy, finance, and agricultural produce, followed by the heads of big Italian gas and energy, and engineering firms - which will be offered entry into the Chinese market.China's Communications and Construction Company will be given access to the port of Trieste to enable links to central and eastern Europe. The Chinese will also be involved in developing the port of Genoa.Italy is the first member of the G7 group of developed world economies to take money offered by China. It is one of the world's top 10 largest economies - yet Rome finds itself in a curious situation. The collapse of the Genoa bridge in August killed dozens of people and made Italy's crumbling infrastructure a major political issue for the first time in decades.And Italy's economy is far from booming.The country slipped into recession at the end of 2018, and its national debt levels are among the highest in the eurozone. Italy's populist government came to power in June 2018 with high-spending plans but had to peg them back after a stand-off with the EU.Mr Di Maio told a news conference: \"Italy has arrived first on the Silk Road and therefore other European countries at this moment have taken a stance on our trade decisions. \"They have taken a critical view and they have the right to this opinion.\" \"We do not want to override our European partners. We firmly remain in the Euro-Atlantic alliance and we remain allies of the United States in Nato,\" he added.There is, however, dissent within the Italian government. Mr Di Maio's coalition partner, the other Deputy Prime Minister, Matteo Salvini, who heads the right-wing League, was conspicuously absent from all official ceremonies. Mr Salvini has warned that he does not want to see foreign businesses \"colonising\" Italy.\"Before allowing someone to invest in the ports of Trieste or Genoa, I would think about it not once but a hundred times,\" Mr Salvini warned.What's in it for China?Italy's move is \"largely symbolic\", according to Peter Frankopan, professor of Global History at Oxford University and a writer on The Silk Roads.But even Rome admitting the BRI is worth exploring \"has a value for Beijing\", he said.\"It adds gloss to the existing scheme and also shows that China has an important global role.\"\"The seemingly innocuous move comes at a sensitive time for Europe and the European Union, where there is suddenly a great deal of trepidation not only about China, but about working out how Europe or the EU should adapt and react to a changing world,\" Prof Frankopan told the BBC.\"But there is more at stake here too,\" he added. \"If investment does not come from China to build ports, refineries, railway lines and so on, then where will it come from?\"The \"made in Italy\" label carries a reputation for quality worldwide, and is legally protected for products items processed \"mainly\" in Italy. In recent years, Chinese factories based in Italy using Chinese labour have been challenging that mark of quality. Better connections for cheap raw materials from China - and the return of finished products from Italy - could exaggerate that practice.The agreements signed in Rome come amid questions over whether Chinese firm Huawei should be permitted to build essential communications networks - after the United States expressed concern they could help Beijing spy on the West.That was not part of the negotiations in Italy.But a little over a week before the deal was due to be signed, the European Commission released a joint statement on \"China's growing economic power and political influence\" and the need to \"review\" relations.As President Xi toured Rome, EU leaders in Brussels considered their approach for relations with China.\"Our aim is to focus on achieving a balanced relation, which ensures fair competition and equal market access,\" Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, said.In March, US National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis pointed out that Italy was a major economy and did not need to \"lend legitimacy to China's vanity infrastructure project\".Italy is a major global economy and a great investment destination. Endorsing BRI lends legitimacy to China\u2019s predatory approach to investment and will bring no benefits to the Italian people.End of Twitter post  by @WHNSC","44":"An average of nearly \u00a39,000 per case was prevented from being stolen from elderly bank customers owing to a rapid response scheme.Bank staff have been trained to spot when customers appear to have been targeted by fraudsters pushing scams such as unnecessary home improvements.Scams totalling an estimated \u00a338m were prevented last year, according to trade body UK Finance.But consumer groups say risks of complex scams remain.Cases include that of a customer at a branch of TSB branch in Stowmarket, Suffolk, who tried to withdraw \u00a319,000.Staff noticed the customer was agitated and quietly asked some more questions in a private room. It emerged that the potential victim had believed they needed to pay an urgent tax bill or be fined \u00a350,000 or sent to jail.  The fraudster had called claiming to be an \"agent\" from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and even suggested the victim make deposits to Bitcoin machines located in newsagents as a way of paying the outstanding bill. No money was lost, owing to the bank staff stepping in.Under the protocol, introduced in October 2016, staff are trained to spot the signs of a scam and can request an immediate police response.A total of 231 arrests and 4,240 emergency calls were made through the industry-wide initiative last year.The average age of banks' customers helped by the scheme was 71.The scheme has prevented \u00a348m of fraud and led to 408 arrests since it was introduced.However, Gareth Shaw, from consumer group Which? said that overall losses to transfer fraud continued to rise \"as people fall victim to increasingly complex scams\".Meanwhile, reporting centre Action Fraud warned that victims of investment scams reported losing more than \u00a3197m last year.The average loss was more than \u00a329,000, as fraudsters used sophisticated tactics to persuade victims to invest by using fake credentials and contacting people through websites made to appear legitimate.","45":"Money saving expert Martin Lewis had said he has had to pull out of his TV appearances because of a throat ulcer.Writing on Facebook on Thursday, he said \"eating and speaking\" had become \"truly agonising\".

The council's finance and resources committee awarded Morrison Utility Services a contract to identify and clear obstructions along the route. Sacyr, Farrans, Neopul Joint Venture (SFNJV) were awarded the contract to design, build and bring into operation the extended tram network. The committee's convener, Councillor Alasdair Rankin, said: \"It's very clear to me that this procurement process has been carried out with enormous thoroughness and diligence, with every effort made to mitigate potential risks in terms of build quality and price. \"I am also greatly reassured by the view expressed by John Baggs, the independent industry expert, who praised this as the most closely scrutinised process he's come across in his many years of experience. \"We have therefore approved these two contractors for the potential Trams to Newhaven project, which will be voted on next week when full council debates the final business case.\"Passenger numbers have been rising on the trams. Figures for 2018 showed 7.3 million people travelled on them.The plan would see the extension funded by borrowing and repaid by revenue from future ticket sales.There will also be financial support through a \u00a320m \"dividend\" from Lothian Buses.","47":"Scams in which criminals trick bank customers into paying them money out of their bank accounts jumped by 45% in the second half of last year.In the six months to December, \u00a3135m was transferred out of personal accounts to fraudsters with the customer's permission.In the first half of 2018, the total was \u00a393m.Over the whole of last year, more than 84,000 bank customers fell victim, some losing tens of thousands of pounds.Banks say scam merchants are shifting their attention from trying to penetrate banking systems to conning members of the public directly.Business are being targeted as well, with a similar sharp rise to \u00a374m in suspicious transfers unwittingly authorised by staff members. The frauds range from dodgy or non-existent goods being sold online to sophisticated scams in which the perpetrator pretends to be a trader known to the customer and demands payments.In some of the worst cases, criminals hack into the email accounts of solicitors handling house sales or builders genuinely working on a house, then send invoices asking customers to transfer money to a fraudulent account.Katy Worobec, who deals with economic crime at UK Finance, believes the most sinister examples are when fraudsters phone, email or arrive in person, claiming to be from the police or from the customer's bank.\"We are seeing a shift away from some of the methods that fraudsters are using to try and attack banks' security systems to focusing on the person and duping them into making the payment themselves,\" she says.The increase in documented cases has happened partly because more banks are detecting and reporting the scams, but UK Finance admits it is worried by the development.The problem is that in most cases, the customer was blamed for authorising the payments and ends up footing the bill.Banks reimbursed \u00a383m of the losses over 2018, but that compared with a total bill to individuals and businesses of \u00a3354m.They have promised to follow a new voluntary code from 28 May this year, under which victims will be refunded if they have met expected standards of behaviour.But banks can still avoid paying if they can prove gross negligence by the customer. ","48":"Karim Hossam was one of the best young tennis players in the world. He looked set to play at the biggest tournaments, with the top players of the game. Instead he was sucked into one of the biggest match-fixing rings yet discovered in a sport riddled with corruption. The BBC's Simon Cox and Paul Grant use confidential documents to tell the story of his downfall.It was inside a modest hotel room in Tunisia in June 2017 that Karim Hossam's tennis career started to unravel. Across from the 24-year-old sat two former British police detectives. They were investigators for the Tennis Integrity Unit, which probes corruption within the game, and they suspected Karim had been fixing matches. In a series of interviews over six months he revealed how four years earlier he had become a part of one of the biggest match-fixing rings in tennis.The International Tennis Federation Futures tournament at Sharm el-Sheikh is a distant cousin to the glamour, money and crowds of Wimbledon or the French Open. Played at a small tennis club next to a shopping mall, there is a smattering of spectators and the prize money for the whole tournament is $15,000 (\u00a311,500) - about a quarter of the sum made by a first-round loser at Wimbledon.Karim Hossam had already won the tournament four times when he arrived to compete there again in 2013. Still only 20, the young Egyptian player was the great hope for North African tennis. As one of the best junior players in the world, hovering on the edge of the top 10, he had started to play in the big ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) tournaments with the stars of the sport. He'd played at the Australian Open and the French Open, but the ITF (International Tennis Federation) tournament at Sharm was one of the many around the world where thousands of lower-ranked players try to scrape a living.Karim Hossam was preparing for a match when a player he didn't know well approached him. \"Do you want to lose the match and get $1,000 (\u00a3770)?\" he asked. The same player had contacted Hossam months earlier, at the Qatar Open, asking if he wanted to lose the first set for $1,000. On that occasion he was facing one of the world's best players, Richard Gasquet - then ranked ninth in the world, some 300 places above Hossam - and he replied: \"I'm playing Gasquet, I'm not here to sell a match.\"But in Sharm el-Sheikh it was different. It didn't really matter if he won or lost and after thinking it over Hossam decided to go ahead with it. He told the investigators, \"I just wanted to try it because I never tried it\u2026 I thought this guy was actually like lying to me\u2026 I didn't know that betting existed.\" The player wasn't lying, though, and after losing the match Hossam went with him to a local branch of Western Union to get his money.The gamblers behind this would have made much more than $1,000, and would have bet on other matches too, often making multiple bets on one match. \"Having that insider knowledge of people involved in match-fixing in a specific sport particularly tennis\u2026 you can really make some fairly decent money,\" says Fred Lord, director for anti-corruption at the International Centre of Sport Security in Qatar. \"We're talking figures around about half a million euros.\"What Karim Hossam didn't realise was that he had sold his career for $1,000. Being found guilty of a single offence by the tennis authorities is punishable by a lifetime ban from the game.Hossam couldn't keep it to himself so he told his father, who had helped to finance his career. He told investigators his father \"was really pissed and he was like, 'You're ruining your life'\".After this first offence, Hossam said, he tried for a while to avoid doing it again. But he also thought that if he had more money it would be easier to advance his career. \"I wanted to go play big tournaments, you know, like I was going to the US for camp or whatever and I needed money,\" he said. So he continued taking money to lose, and before long he was also acting as a fixer, the middleman between gamblers and players. Sometimes it involved losing a match, or on other occasions a single set. It depended what the gamblers wanted and what got them the best odds.He spent the next four years helping to fix dozens of matches in Egypt, Tunisia and Nigeria, typically earning $200 for a $1,000 fix. A cache of confidential documents seen by the BBC shows how the young player arranged the fixes through Facebook messages with dozens of North African players. In May 2016 he contacts a player with an offer: \"Bro. You lose first set then win the match. You get 2,500.\" The figures were always in dollars. When the other player agrees to this, Hossam makes sure he understands his instructions: \"So you will lose the first set then win the match. Do you surely understand?\" The player responds, \"Score is not important. I just need to lose first set?\"He is reassured by Hossam: \"Most important thing is you drop the set then win.\" The player tells Hossam, \"Hopefully it's OK because I need the money.\" They carry on messaging throughout the afternoon but there's a hitch and the fix doesn't go through.On other occasions it runs more smoothly. In August 2016 he messages another player in the early hours of the morning: \"One set for 3,000.\" Intrigued by the offer, the player replies, \"How much to lose?\" and he is told, \"Lose for 3,000 my friend.\" In the event the player did lose.The documents the BBC has seen implicate more than 20 players, most of them from North Africa, in either directly fixing matches or failing to tell the authorities when they were approached. Any player who is approached and asked to fix a match has to report it and failure to do so is an offence that can lead to a lengthy ban.In June 2017 the tennis anti-corruption authorities finally caught up with him. In his first interview with investigators he told them how he was drawn into fixing.\"I just couldn't afford playing any more and like my dad was paying for me, and then my dad has to pay for my brother as well, and then I wasn't getting any income,\" he says, the transcript shows.After the interview ends he messages his younger brother, Youssef, who is also a professional tennis player. \"They caught me in my room bro,\" he writes. \"And I was stupid I didn't delete some things.\"Hossam tells his brother he is hopeful of escaping any tough sanctions by co-operating with the authorities. \"I am telling them I want to work with them. Would be [expletive] great if that is possible. I travel and get money to catch all the fixers.\"That wasn't how it turned out. Days after he was interviewed by the Tennis Integrity Unit, Karim Hossam was provisionally banned from playing tennis. That same day he messaged a fellow player telling him about the ban but vowing, \"I am gonna bet even more now.\"By the time of his final interview, in January 2018, Karim Hossam says he has been reduced to coaching children. The investigators ask if he will give evidence against the player who first corrupted him.\"We feel very strongly that if he's done that to you he's probably done it to other people and he's probably still doing it,\" one of the investigators tells him. \"So he's somebody, I'm sure you would agree, you would want to get out of tennis, because he is a danger because he grooms young players\u2026 If it wasn't for him you may never be where you are today.\"Karim had hoped there would be some benefit for him in co-operating with the Tennis Integrity Unit, and seems disappointed that he has got nothing out of it.\"I gave a lot of information. I didn't really lie about anything, I was open,\" he tells them.\"But receiving a lifetime ban in tennis, I mean I've been playing tennis for 17 years, I was only forced to do this under circumstances\u2026 So pretty much like I don't see any like benefits from my side\u2026 I honestly don't have any more evidence\u2026 I don't have any more chats.\"In July 2018 Karim Hossam was banned for life. But the confidential files the BBC has seen show he continued to try to corrupt the sport.In August 2018 he has a long conversation with a player to whom he offers $3,500 to lose a set by a specific score. In the end, word gets out the match is fixed and the gambler backs off. Karim Hossam suspects one of the players has talked. \"My friend we need men not babies,\" he tells him.The BBC contacted Karim Hossam to ask him about these messages and his contact with other players but he didn't respond. The documents reveal one of the largest match-fixing rings in tennis ever discovered, implicating more than 20 mostly North African players. Last month police in Spain arrested 15 people in a match-fixing ring said to involve 28 Spanish players linked to an Armenian gambling ring. Armenian gamblers were also involved in a match-fixing ring uncovered by Belgian police in June 2018. The files the BBC has seen show that one of Karim's contacts was an Armenian.Most of the players in this match-fixing ring have not been sanctioned. And the player who first corrupted Karim Hossam - the one investigators wanted him to testify against - is still playing professional tennis.The documents seen by the BBC have been sent to the Tennis Integrity Unit, and the whistleblower who contacted the BBC is critical of the unit's response.\"The TIU are ineffective because their processes are inefficient and slow. They receive evidence about someone and their investigation is ended two years later,\" he says.\"I had a player tell me he is definitely going to get a lifetime ban soon and is going to go out with a bang in the last couple of tournaments he is going to play. Why allow players this chance?\"The Tennis Integrity Unit said it was at the forefront of the fight against sporting corruption, and had successfully prosecuted 44 people in the last two years - 16 of whom were given lifetime bans. It added that it couldn't comment on ongoing investigations as \"public disclosure would inevitably alert suspects and allow credible evidence to be discarded or destroyed\". In 2018 an independent review panel looked into the integrity of tennis after a BBC News and BuzzFeed investigation revealed suspected illegal betting. It said the Tennis Integrity Unit had a backlog of cases and that there was a \"tsunami\" of corruption within the sport.The sport's governing body, the International Tennis Federation, told the BBC: \"We are committed to protecting the integrity of tennis and putting in place the necessary measures to do that\". But it conceded, \"there is a significant amount of work to do.\"Listen to the full BBC Arabic\/Radio 4 investigation, Can We Fix It?The Inside Story of Match-Fixing in Tennis, at 20:00 GMT on File on 4 on Tuesday 5 FebruaryJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.","49":"Customers suffered dozens of digital banking shutdowns last year, according to new figures that reveal the scale of banks' IT problems for the first time.UK banks have begun publishing the number of operational and security incidents that have occurred, under a voluntary scheme overseen by the financial regulator.The data reveals major banks typically suffer well over one outage a month.Barclays reported the most problems, but said many were minor incidents.  Banks were told by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to show evidence of the quality of the service they were providing. The aim was to make it easier for customers to compare what banks were offering and to switch accounts.As a result, banks now publish details on their websites showing the time it takes to open an account and to replace a lost or stolen card if you bank with them. The figures suggest that typically overdrafts can be provided very quickly, often on the same day, whereas lost or stolen cards take more than five days on average to replace.Other details include how and when customers can make payments, cancel cheques, and whether 24-hour help is available.This month, for the first time, the data also shows the frequency of IT-related shutdowns. Prior to this there had been little evidence available about the number of times bank services have been unavailable owing to security or operational incidents.The figures cover the nine months to the end of last year, and analysis by the BBC reveals that most major High Street banks suffered more than ten shutdowns between April and December.Barclays had the highest number of incidents with 41 over the nine months.A spokesman for the bank said: \"We take IT resilience extremely seriously and we welcome transparency for our customers which is why we report every incident to the regulator, even minor glitches that have minimal impact on customers.\"  He added that the bank's service was designed to allow customers to use other channels, such as branches and telephone banking when problems occurred. Moreover, the bank had its own status page to keep customers informed of which services were working and which were not, he said.Lloyds Bank suffered the second highest number of outages with 37 recorded instances, and other brands in the Lloyds Banking Group jointly had 31.Recently customers expressed their frustration with one Lloyds brand, MBNA, after IT updates made it difficult for customers to pay off their credit cards.The scale of the problem is significant, according to financial analyst Andrew Hagger, of Moneycomms.\"There will be occasions when there are minor glitches,\" he said. \"But there comes a time when [the banks] have got to overhaul these systems. When banks are pushing us towards online and mobile banking, some savings from branch closures and profits should be apportioned to getting systems up to speed.\"A spokeswoman for UK Finance, which represents the banks, said that providers worked \"around the clock\" to minimise disruption and get services working again when incidents occurred.\"Operational resilience is crucial in a modern financial system and is a key priority for the industry,\" said. UK Finance said its members invested billions of pounds in ensuring IT and human systems were \"robust and secure\".Nicky Morgan. who chairs the Treasury Committee, which has an ongoing inquiry into IT failures in the financial sector, said: \"IT failures at banks are a regular occurrence. We all think 'please don't let it be mine', but these failures now seem to have an air of inevitability.\"These figures are concerning, especially considering that the availability of these online services is vital as more and more customers are ushered online.\"The number of shutdowns does not necessarily translate to poor customer satisfaction. Barclays, despite recording the highest number of incidents, was ranked second in official rankings for mobile and online banking, and joint fifth for overall satisfaction in a survey of 16,000 banking customers.","50":"The Scottish government has defended plans that could see motorists taxed for parking at work amid claims that it will \"fleece\" workers for hundreds of pounds a year. Proposals for a workplace parking levy were included in last week's budget agreement between the SNP and Greens. Deputy First Minister John Swinney told MSPs that it would be up to individual councils whether to introduce it.The Conservatives said the tax would hit low-paid workers the hardest. Under the proposals, councils would be able to charge employers an annual tax for every parking space they provide for employees. Employers could then choose to foot the bill themselves - or pass on some or all of the cost to their employees. Councils in England have had the power to introduce a parking tax for about 20 years, but only Nottingham has done so. The Nottingham scheme currently charges just over \u00a3400 a year for each parking space - and has been credited with cutting congestion and pollution while raising \u00a350m for sustainable transport projects since 2012. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay admitted on Wednesday that no economic analysis of the potential impact of the policy in Scotland had been carried out. But speaking at Holyrood on Thursday, Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said a \u00a3400 annual charge \"would be equivalent to increasing the basic rate of tax paid by a worker on the real living wage from 20p in the pound to 30p in the pound\".He went on to claim that \"tens of thousands of Scottish workers are to be fleeced for hundreds of pounds a year just because Derek Mackay, John Swinney and Nicola Sturgeon can't say no to six dismal Green MSPs\".Mr Carlaw questioned why the government had promised in its budget agreement that the levy would not apply to NHS workers - but there was no mention of teachers, police officers or other public sector workers.He urged the Scottish government to \"drop this wanted and unworkable plan\", which he said the Conservatives would continue to oppose. And he highlighted comments by SNP backbencher Richard Lyle, who told Holyrood two months ago that: \"I am not for your parking charge levy, and I speak on behalf of thousands of motorists who've been taxed enough.\"Mr Swinney, who was filling in for Nicola Sturgeon at first minister's questions because she in on a trip to the US and Canada, responded by insisting that the proposal was about \"empowering\" councils. He said: \"It will enable local authorities to exercise a judgment as to whether they wish to apply a workplace parking levy. \"The decision will be up to local authorities - it is an example of localism in practice and I would have thought the Conservatives would welcome that.\"Mr Swinney also said that, as a minority government, the SNP had no choice but to talk to and reach agreement with other parties if its budget was to pass - and accused the Tories of being \"conspicuously absent\" from these talks. He said: \"Jackson Carlaw has been found out today, he goes around the country arguing for more powers for local government and when we deliver them, he comes here in an act of rank hypocrisy and criticises them.\"The people of Scotland can see through the hypocrisy of the Tories, they can see what the Tories are about, their spots have never changed, they want to cut public spending and they will take the hypocritical way of doing it.\"The power for councils to levy a workplace parking tax is to be introduced via the Transport Bill, with Green MSP John Finnie planning to table an amendment which SNP members have committed to backing.The bill is still in the early stages of the legislative process, and the rural economy committee was told on Wednesday that it was set to be delayed.Convener Edward Mountain said ministers had requested a delay \"partly on resource capacity within the Scottish government\", and partly because of the parking levy amendment.Members had stressed the need for extra time to conduct a full consultation on how the plans would work.While the government confirmed the delay on Thursday, with the bill likely to be on hold until \"early summer\", a spokesman claimed the move was was \"unconnected to the budget\" and was instead because of Brexit.","51":"If you want to get this briefing by email, sign-up hereUS President Donald Trump and North Korea's KIm Jong-un are to hold a second summit in three weeks' time.

Congress had revealed a minimum income policy would be part of its election manifesto in January, but had not released details until Monday.Mr Gandhi said that the poorest 20% of Indian households would receive 72,000 rupees ($1050) yearly as part of the scheme, which is called Nyay (Justice).He said 50 million families - or 250 million people - would directly benefit.\"The final assault on poverty has begun. We will wipe out poverty from the country,\" he said, adding that Congress had been advised by \"many economists\".The scheme could cost up to $52bn. French economist Thomas Piketty, noted for his work on income inequality, had been rumoured to be advising Congress on the scheme. But he told the BBC he had \"not been directly involved in the design of this proposal\".\"But I certainly support all efforts to reduce income inequality in India, and especially to move away the political debate from caste-based political to class-based redistribution of income and wealth.\"There has been much discussion in recent years over whether India can introduce a Universal Basic Income (UBI) - a regular cash payment from the state for all or most citizens without any conditions. In 2017, the Indian government's economic survey suggested that a scheme benefitting 75% of the population could significantly reduce poverty. Such schemes have been trialled at small-scale all over the world, including in Finland, Kenya and the Netherlands.The Congress policy, while not a UBI, is seen as a limited version of such a scheme.The announcement is seen as a bid to fire up voters who will head to the polls in April and May, but economists have warned the policy will be hard to implement in a country as vast as India.It remains unclear what data would be used to determine eligibility for the Nyay scheme. There have been various estimates on the exact number of poor in India, and the counts have been mired in controversy.  Mr Gandhi did not specify how the scheme would be funded.Finding the money to support tens of millions of families would require scrapping existing government subsidies on food and fertilisers, and removing certain tax incentives, economic commentator Vivek Kaul told the BBC.However such measures would be unpopular with wide swathes of the population.It has been estimated that a true UBI could cost India some 5% of its yearly gross domestic product. \"This is a watered-down version and it's good that it's a watered-down version,\" Mr Kaul said. \"At some level, you need to start small and see how you are going to finance it, and then see if you want to grow a little bigger.\"Some economists have voiced criticism of basic income schemes, saying they reduce the incentive to work. India already has more than 900 federally-funded welfare schemes, including cheap food, fertiliser subsidies, a rural jobs guarantee and student scholarships.But Congress has insisted its plan is workable.\"A lot of thinking and working has gone into the income scheme,\" Praveen Chakravarty, head of the data analytics department of the Congress party, told the BBC in January. \"It is fiscally doable without drastic reduction of existing welfare schemes.\"","53":"Construction company Dawnus has gone into administration, according to subcontractors.People who work for the Swansea-based firm were called to a meeting on Thursday morning.But they were sent home afterwards, and could be seen removing tools from the site.It comes after work on the \u00a312m Kingsway redevelopment in Swansea and a road project in Manchester were both halted.Three school building projects in Powys could also be delayed, including one which is scheduled for completion in September. And Fishguard and Goodwick Town Council posted on Facebook that a new road project in Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, had also been affected.Dawnus - which runs construction projects across the UK and overseas - referred the BBC to accounting firm Grant Thornton when asked for comment.People leaving the Swansea meeting said they had been told the firm had gone into administration.The boss of one sub-contracting firm, who did not want to be named, said: \"We got wind that there were problems a few weeks ago and decided to remove some equipment on site as a precautionary measure.\"We are still out of pocket - but thankfully not a significant amount. \"I think we might have got off lightly compared with what I've heard about other firms.\"On Tuesday, diggers were abandoned on the \u00a315m Manchester-Salford Inner Relief Route improvement scheme, which is upgrading six major junctions along Regent Road, amid claims workers had not been paid by Dawnus.The following day, workers in Swansea were sent home by their bosses.A spokesperson for the Manchester-Salford Inner Relief Road scheme, which is being carried out jointly by Manchester and Salford city councils, said it was seeking \"urgent clarification\" about the status of Dawnus.\"We are currently pursuing all other options to ensure the project can continue as quickly as possible,\" they added. Swansea council said work on the Kingsway site had come to a sudden stop on Wednesday and it was taking control of the site. \"We have already taken a number of steps and we are considering our options,\" a spokesman added.The council said it was working through issues relating to appointing a new contractor \"as a matter of urgency\" and was in discussion with the supply chain. The council said Dawnus had also recently begun work as the main contractor for its new pupil referral unit at Cockett, and it was also taking control of that site.\"We are determined that these two important schemes are completed as planned\u2026we are taking all the necessary steps to resolve these issues as quickly as possible.\"Dawnus has its headquarters in Swansea but runs construction projects across the UK and overseas.The most recent company accounts show the company had a turnover of \u00a3170m in 2017, but it also posted a pre-tax loss of \u00a31.35m. Last September, the company said it employed 700 people and was optimistic about the future.Among its past projects across the UK are the Great Western Air Ambulance Charity and National Police Air Service Air Operations in South Gloucestershire, a creative industries centre at Kingston College in London, and South Wokingham Secondary School in Berkshire. Dawnus has previously operated in west Africa, and worked on projects during the Ebola crisis.  In August, during a UK trade mission to South Africa attended by Prime Minister Theresa May, Dawnus was unveiled as part of a consortium targeting overseas aid contracts.     The company told BBC Wales in September that they felt optimistic about life after Brexit because of the opportunities for overseas work. In Powys, Dawnus has contracts to build three new schools - two new primary schools in Welshpool, and a replacement for the county's first all-through school Ysgol Bro Hyddgen in Machynlleth.One of the primary schools is scheduled for completion in September while the other two projects have not yet started work. \"We will be working to mitigate any potential issues which arise,\" said Councillor Myfanwy Alexander, cabinet member for learning and Welsh language.Rhondda Cynon Taf council said Dawnus had the contract for the \u00a31.5m Pontrhondda Bridge replacement in Llwynypia, due for completion this summer. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford described Dawnus as a \"very important company\".\"It's obviously a worrying time for all those people who work for the company, but also there are projects across Wales the company is involved in,\" he said.The Welsh Government would do whatever it could to assist those affected, he added. David Price, finance editor of Construction News, said there had been rumours Dawnus was facing trouble after reports of losses.\"In 2014-2015 they made significant losses of around \u00a313m, connected to work in Africa, and they have struggled to recover from that since then,\" he said.Analysis by BBC Wales business correspondent Brian MeechanDawnus has grown from a small Welsh firm to a big name in the construction industry.It's one of more than 50 \"anchor companies\" identified by the Welsh Government as having global reach and a headquarters in Wales.Dawnus was seen as a responsible employer with a good reputation for delivery.Welsh construction firm Cuddy also went into administration recently, but the impact of the collapse of Dawnus has caused a greater shock throughout the industry.One of the issues with the Welsh economy is the lack of small firms that steadily grow to become large companies.And as Brexit looms companies are being encouraged to look to new markets, especially outside of Europe.Dawnus was a good example of a company that did both these things.However, it appears the firm has struggled to recover from past problems on some of its projects in Africa. Some in the industry are concerned other small businesses may now see it as a warning about expansion, rather than the success story it once was.Construction is incredibly competitive and margins are tight, and something going wrong on just one or two projects can cause enormous damage to a business.On top of this, budgets are being squeezed in the public sector - and the private sector appears to be holding back on some investment due to the current uncertainty around Brexit.Projects like the M4 and Wylfa, which Dawnus would certainly have hoped to work on, are on hold.Whenever one of these large companies goes into administration the concern immediately turns to the suppliers, contractors and workers who will be affected by it.It may take some time before we know what the full impact will be.","54":"A special tribunal is to be set up in South Africa with powers to fast-track prosecutions and recover the proceeds of corruption.President Cyril Ramaphosa said the tribunal would consider cases brought by the Special Investigating Unit.After 25 years in power, the African National Congress has become tainted by widespread allegations of corruption, which forced out Mr Ramaphosa's predecessor, Jacob Zuma, last year.South Africa faces elections on 8 May.Mr Ramaphosa's announcement of the eight-member panel comes a day after the largest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said it would place the fight against corruption at the heart of its election campaign.\"I want to say to all the politicians, if you are corrupt, you can expect to spend 15 years in jail,\" said DA leader Mmusi Maimane at the launch of its manifesto.Mr Ramaphosa has vowed to tackle corruption since coming to power. In his State of the Nation Address earlier this month, he announced the creation of a special investigating team to deal with serious corruption and associated offences within the National Prosecution Authority.But in November 2018, he was forced to repay $35,000 (\u00a327,300) given to his leadership campaign by a firm accused of corruption.The donor, a firm called Bosasa, has won lucrative government contracts but is under investigation.The revelations were made at an ongoing judicial inquiry into \"state capture\" - the allegation that under Mr Zuma, the state was effectively taking instructions from businesses which used corrupt politicians to further their own interests.The Gupta family have been at the heart of these accusations.One allegation is that Ajay Gupta offered a bribe of $42m (\u00a332m) to ANC politician Mcebisi Jonas to take up the post of finance minister.Ajay Gupta and his two brothers deny all allegations of wrongdoing and earlier this month a warrant for his arrest was cancelled.The judicial inquiry is also looking into allegations of corruption at state-owned power firm Eskom, which are allegedly one factor behind a recent spate of nationwide power cuts.Mr Zuma is on trial for alleged corruption relating to a multi-billion dollar arms deal in the 1990s. He has denied any wrongdoing.","55":"Some of the UK's major aid agencies may be facing a funding shortfall once Britain leaves the European Union.Many had hoped that funding might continue after Brexit, especially if a deal is agreed. Aid agencies in non-EU member Switzerland have regularly received EU funding, based on the strong bilateral ties Switzerland has with the bloc.But an EU letter sent to 10 Swiss non-governmental organisations suggests problems ahead.It explains that as from 1 January this year, Swiss agencies will no longer be eligible for funding. The reason: there is no longer \"a suitable legal basis\" to award money to organisations not based in the EU.Oxfam, Save the Children and numerous other UK based non-governmental organisations regularly receive funding from the European Commission's department for humanitarian aid, ECHO. But that funding - on paper at least - is based on the fact that the recipient organisation is headquartered in an EU member state.UK aid agency officials say they have been making \"contingency preparations for months,\" but still cannot be sure exactly what will happen.Swiss agencies receive funding  based on the merit of the aid project they proposed.For Caritas Switzerland, currently running a \"Quality of Learning and Child Protection\" programme in Syria worth \u20ac1.2m (\u00a31m; $1.3m) it came as a shock.\"We were informed at very short notice,\" said Stefan Gribi. \"It's very unusual at this international level to communicate such a decision just ten days before it takes effect.\"\"We're surprised that the interpretation of the same legal situation has changed from one day to another,\" added Alexander Koch of World Vision Switzerland. \"We didn't expect this partnership to be ended so abruptly, without prior discussion or time to work on a compromise.\"One of Switzerland's best-known humanitarian groups, the Red Cross, is legally classified as an international organisation, and so will not be affected. ECHO has insisted its decision to end the Swiss funding, worth around \u20ac50m a year, is based purely on a legal reassessment. But the Swiss agencies are not so sure. They suspect they are casualties of the EU's Brexit planning - if Brussels is thinking of ending funding to aid agencies in soon to be non-member Britain, then why not signal that risk by ending funding to Switzerland?The potential loss to major UK organisations like Oxfam or Save the Children is huge.Last year Oxfam received around \u20ac23m from ECHO to fund projects in Yemen, Iraq and Bangladesh. ECHO is a major donor to Save the Children too, supporting projects in Syria, South Sudan and Yemen.Some UK aid agencies say the danger signs are already obvious. UK project managers have reportedly been advised by EU representatives not to submit new proposals, and others say they have been told funding contracts will have to wait until Brexit terms are finally agreed.The UK's Department of International Development offers some comfort in an advice paper for aid agencies, suggesting \"the government commits to funding the post-March 2019 outputs of any programme funded from ECHO's core budget, where a UK organisation is the lead consortium partner or sole implementer. This will apply only in a no deal scenario when ECHO terminates funding.\"But this only commits to finance existing projects so that they do not finish abruptly, and makes no mention of future aid funding.\"We're aware that the ability of UK NGO's to bid for EU funds will depend on the outcome of the Brexit talks,\" a spokesman for Oxfam said. \"We urge all involved to minimise the negative impact on those for whom aid provides a vital lifeline.\"In Switzerland, affected agencies have been told that programmes already under way can at least continue to their expected end.Caritas' work with children in Syria will not be affected. But no further projects will be approved, so Caritas proposals for several further aid programmes worth \u20ac10m - and for which it had expected approval at the end of this month - will not go ahead.And from now on Swiss NGO's cannot propose or lead ECHO funded programmes, meaning that expertise in humanitarian work which they have built up over years will not be used.\"We focus on the most vulnerable people in the most fragile countries\u2026 and this is in-line with ECHO's strategy,\" said Alexander Koch.   \"I wonder, who will suffer because of this decision? It's in nobody's interest.\"","56":"While the two Bs - Brexit and budget - continue to be the hot topics, the justice portfolio also gets a fair hearing this week.Tuesday and Thursday afternoon will be given over to stage one debates on two bills designed to improve the justice system for both victims and offenders.First, the Vulnerable Witnesses (Criminal Evidence) (Scotland) Bill attempts to improve the process of gathering witnesses statements by enabling pre-recorded evidence in court trials.Under the new system, child witnesses could give evidence in a more secure environment and victims of sexual assault will not have to face their abusers in court.Then the Management of Offenders (Scotland) Bill will be discussed on Thursday, which proposes to increase the use of electronic tags and help offenders reintegrate into the community.It is hoped such a move will cut reoffending - but the justice committee has called for a robust risk assessment system to prevent breaches of parole.This is particularly pertinent after the police watchdog recommended a new law should be introduced to prosecute breaches, following the murder of Craig McClelland in Paisley.But that's not all that is going on at Holyrood...Prior to the debate on the Vulnerable Witnesses Bill, Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing will mark the publication of Scotland's Forestry Strategy 2019-2029 with a statement.A draft plan was consulted on last autumn, which set out an overall aim of expanding woodland areas, ensuring sustainable management, and increasing the economic, environment and social benefits of forestry.Forestry was fully devolved to Scotland after the passage of the Forestry and Land Management (Scotland) Bill last year.The member's debate in the evening will focus on World Cancer Day 2019, led by SNP MSP Emma Harper.In the morning, the economy committee begins its inquiry into construction and the economy.MSPs will hear from a range of stakeholders about challenges facing the sector, including access to finance, procurement and Scotland's infrastructure needs.Elsewhere, the health committee continues to consider amendments to the safe staffing bill.A busy afternoon sees business start at an earlier time of 1:30pm with a statement on Brexit preparations.This will likely be information on how no-deal planning is going.After portfolio questions on education and skills, MSPs will then turn to the meat (or rather, fish) of the afternoon: salmon farming.The rural economy committee is leading this debate following its inquiry which concluded there was \"insufficient evidence\" to support calls for a moratorium on the industry's expansion.But this was not a unanimous decision, with Labour MSP Colin Smyth and Green MSP John Finnie dissenting.The committee made 64 other recommendations on improving regulations for the sector though.It was sparked by concerns about the impact of disease on the wild salmon sector and wider environment.In response to the report, Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing insisted that some of the issues raised were already being addressed - a point which will be echoed throughout the debate.But he also criticised the committee for not having \"fully explored nor analysed that economic and social contribution\" the sector brings.The day will end on a slightly more consensual note, as Tory MSP Jeremy Balfour leads a member's debate highlighting the Scottish Powerchair Football Association.While the afternoon is set to be a lively one, do not forget that in the morning the finance committee will hear from Finance Secretary Derek Mackay about last week's budget deal.The deal includes more core funding for councils and extra powers for them to levy local parking and tourist taxes.After the evidence session, the committee will be asked to vote for amendments to the Budget Bill - of which there are four to increase portfolio budgets in health and local government.Like last year, MSPs are unlikely to vote against - after all it does mean more funding for these areas.Before the debate on the Management of Offenders Bill, there will be first minister's questions followed by a member's debate on Kilmarnock FC's 150th anniversary, led by SNP MSP Willie Coffey.While full committee agendas are yet to be published, the equalities committee continues its discussion of amendments to the Age of Criminal Responsibility (Scotland) Bill. Also, the petitions committee considers a call for a closed-containment method with full water filtering for salmon farms.","57":"A system making a recipient's name as important as the bank account number and sort code when payments are made could be delayed by up to 18 months.The Confirmation of Payee system means anyone making a payment will be alerted if the name does not match the account.It is designed to prevent millions of pounds worth of fraud and regulators wanted it to start in July.But UK Finance, which represents banks, said the system would not be ready until \"some time next year\".The Payment Systems Regulator, which will ultimately set the deadline, said it wanted the new rules to be in place as soon as possible, but only when they could be effective.At present, anyone making a payment adds the intended recipient's name, but it is ignored by the bank. Only the account number and sort code need to match for the payment to be successful, so fraudsters pose as someone legitimate to trick victims into paying them money.When setting up a new payment, or amending an existing one, banks will be able to check the name on the account of the person or organisation you are paying. The aim of Confirmation of Payee is to cut down on so-called authorised push payment (APP) scams, in which people are conned into sending money to another account.One APP victim was Angelene Bungay, of Shrewsbury, who was duped into paying \u00a313,000 to someone posing as the builder carrying out her loft conversion. She was not refunded by her bank. Banks typically refund only about a fifth of the money that goes missing, pointing to legislation that says customers may be liable if they authorise the payment and are negligent. Hundreds of millions of pounds have been lost in this kind of scam, with some victims losing life-changing sums. During evidence to the Commons' Treasury Committee, Stephen Jones, of UK Finance, said for the first time that it was the intention that victims would be reimbursed when neither the bank or the victim were to blame for the fraud. This could eventually be funded from insurance, although other options are being considered.He also said that Confirmation of Payee would not be ready by July, which was the regulator's suggestion during consultation, but some time next year. He said it had not dropped down the list of banks' priorities, but was a complex change in their IT and processing systems.\"This is a big change at a time of a lot of change,\" he told the committee.A spokesman for the regulator, the PSR, said: \"We want to see Confirmation of Payee brought in as soon as possible and also make sure that when it is introduced, it is an effective way to stop this crime taking place. \"As it stands, we are still working through the responses to our consultation and so no decisions on timing have been made.\"Consumer groups have previously accused banks of dragging their heels on introducing the system.Gareth Shaw, from Which?, said: \"Any extended delay to this vital measure would be a huge betrayal of bank customers and is likely to result in millions of pounds being lost unnecessarily to bank transfer scams, with devastating consequences for the victims.\"Banking trade body UK Finance offers the following advice:","58":"President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen is suing the Trump Organization, arguing it owes him millions in legal fees and costs. The company is allegedly reneging on a payment deal after Cohen cooperated with investigations into its business.He has given evidence to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian involvement in the 2016 US presidential election.Cohen says the costs total about $1.9 million (\u00a31.45m) and are still growing.The lawsuit says the group should pay the roughly $1.9m Cohen has been ordered to pay as part of his criminal sentence for work done \"at the behest of the Trump Organization\".The 52-year-old will begin a three-year prison sentence in May for the campaign finance violation of paying hush money to one of Mr Trump's alleged mistresses, as well as convictions for tax evasion and lying to Congress.Cohen last week gave dramatic testimony to the US Congressional House Oversight Committee about the president, during which he accused him of being a \"racist\", \"conman\" and a \"cheat\".The president has turned on Mr Cohen, who was his personal lawyer and fixer for approximately a decade, and accused him of lying.If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don\u2019t retain the services of Michael Cohen!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpMr Cohen's lawsuit, filed in a Manhattan court, says he was involved in several court cases and legal proceedings - including Mr Mueller's Russia investigation.Under an indemnification agreement Cohen allegedly signed with the Trump Organization in July 2017, the company agreed that it would pay all of Cohen's fees and costs in connection with cases related to the company.But despite written requests for reimbursement, the company has not paid him since May 2018, about the time Mr Cohen agreed to cooperate with the Special Counsel's investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the 2016 election, while President Trump has frequently criticised Mr Mueller's investigation into his campaign and its alleged links with Moscow.","59":"If you want to get this briefing by email, sign-up hereTheresa May is looking to alter her Brexit deal with the EU, so that MPs can give it their backing in a week's time - having overwhelmingly rejected it in January. So a UK delegation is going to Brussels to try to secure legally binding changes to what was agreed previously.It wants a guarantee that the backstop - the plan to ensure there's no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic under any circumstances - cannot be allowed to remain in place indefinitely. Here's an explanation of what the backstop is and what all the controversy is about.The UK is due to leave the EU in 24 days' time. If MPs reject Mrs May's withdrawal agreement for a second time, they will then be able to vote on quitting without any deal at all. If they decide against this, they can vote on whether to extend negotiations and push Brexit back.But the EU's other 27 countries also have to agree unanimously to allow any such delay. It's getting complicated, so why not try our simple guide to Brexit?Eight out of 10 councils in England are planning to impose the maximum possible increase in council tax bills, a survey by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa) says.

The industrial action is the second strike in the space of three weeks with more strike days scheduled for later in the year.The EIS Further Education Lecturers' Association (Fela) is calling for a \"fair\" pay rise and has rejected the 2.5% offer from the colleges. But Colleges Scotland described the pay demands as \"unreasonable\".It is expected that many classes will be cancelled but college buildings and facilities such as libraries are likely to remain open. EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said: \"Further education lecturers have not received a cost-of-living pay increase for almost three years, since April 2016.\"In hope of reaching a negotiated agreement, the EIS recently submitted an amended proposal which we believed would be likely to break the impasse. \"The EIS is asking only for a fair cost-of-living increase, similar to that already awarded to college support staff and also in-line with public sector pay policy.\"He added: \"Management's claims of unaffordability of our claim have already been shown to be based on some rather questionable calculations. \"The actual costs of the award to support staff and our pay claim for lecturers are practically identical, yet Colleges Scotland continues to push the fantasy that one claim is affordable and sustainable while the other is unaffordable and unrealistic.\"Lecturers voted  to take strike action last year and details of the pay dispute are complex. Many lecturers have had substantial pay rises in recent years because of an agreement to equalise rates of pay at different colleges. Many would also get such payments this year.However, some other lecturers - especially those who worked at the colleges which previously had the highest rates of pay - have seen their basic salaries remain unchanged for three years.The EIS Fela believes the cost-of-living pay rise for all lecturers and rises to help standardise salaries should be treated as distinct issues.John Gribben, director of employment services at umbrella body Colleges Scotland Employers' Association, said: \"It is disappointing that the EIS-Fela has not suspended strike action whilst negotiations are ongoing. We have met with the EIS-Fela on 10 occasions to discuss pay and will be meeting them again on 7 February to try and end this disruptive strike action.  \"The EIS-Fela is aware that colleges are already having to make cuts to finance the additional pay offer which they have rejected. Their unreasonable pay demands would mean fewer courses, fewer students, and fewer lecturing jobs in the college sector.\"College lecturers in Scotland are by far the best paid across the UK and they have rejected a combined pay deal that would increase national average pay by over 12%, or more than \u00a34,000, from 2017\/20.\" ","61":"A councillor living 400 miles from his ward has given up part of his allowance after being the only one not to do so in solidarity with staff facing cuts.Donald Adey moved from his ward in Cambridge to Scotland a year ago, but remains on the county and city councils.County council staff had to take three days' leave unpaid and all other councillors made allowance sacrifices.Mr Adey initially failed to do so, but has now reversed his decision.The councillor, who lives in Cupar in Fife and rarely attends council meetings, represents Trumpington as an independent after he quit the Liberal Democrats in 2018.Following a vote in December, 60 of the 61 county councillors agreed to give up 1.2% of their allowance - equivalent to the financial loss suffered by staff. However, Mr Adey declined to do so. He claimed \u00a310,000 a year for his county council role and received \u00a34,500 from the city council.Cambridge City Council has called for rules to remove councillors who live too far away.Earlier this month, a journalist from the Local Democracy Reporting Service in Cambridgeshire travelled to Scotland to speak to Mr Adey about his councillor commitments, after he failed to respond to a number of messages.Mr Adey told the reporter he planned to quit the city council next month because it was \"hard to cover both bases\".Mr Adey has since agreed to give up part of his allowance, but has maintained there are bigger problems in the local government system.Mr Adey said: \"The root of the problem with local government finance, the extreme lack of it, is both in Cambridgeshire the cut, cut mentality of the Tories - even before [former Prime Minister] Margaret Thatcher came to power - and in more recent years, self-imposed austerity from national government.\"Forcing staff on to unpaid leave is no sustainable answer\u2026 more an act of desperation.\"","62":"Evidence has emerged of a government agency's role in the Royal Bank of Scotland's (RBS) controversial Global Restructuring Group (GRG).The Asset Protection Agency influenced GRG's strategy including decisions that determined business customers' fortunes, the BBC has learnt.Separate court evidence suggests the agency told RBS to withdraw customer support, when the bank did not want to.RBS said it disagreed with the claims while the Treasury declined to comment.More than 16,000 small business customers were transferred to RBS's Global Restructuring Group.In what MPs have referred to as the worst scandal since the financial crash, GRG was found in a leaked official report for the Financial Conduct Authority to have mistreated thousands of business customers. Many of them were ruined and others lost not only their livelihoods but their marriages and their physical and mental health.The extent of Treasury influence in the scandal is underlined by previously unnoticed Asset Protection Agency (APA) documents showing the Treasury agency influenced GRG's strategy and its approach to customers' loans. Official APA documents also suggest the bank was prohibited from releasing GRG customers from secured loans without its approval, giving the Treasury an effective veto on any re-financing by business customers wanting to exit GRG.Meanwhile, Oliver Morley Estates, an industrial warehousing company based in the north west of England, which is taking legal action against RBS, has suggested GRG relationship managers rejected a proposal to re-finance much of the business because of the Asset Protection Agency's (APA) views.Emails quoted in court reveal that RBS wanted to support the rescue proposal, arranged by founder Oliver Morley to re-finance more than \u00a370m of loans to his property group with the help of another bank, believing it to be \"the best option for the bank\".However, the Treasury's Asset Protection Agency blocked the bank from doing so, according to evidence disclosed in court. Instead it wanted the property to be sold to RBS's own property division, West Register.The court heard RBS managers saw the APA's view as \"certainly their craziest decision yet\". Yet RBS staff thought \"the APA's views are clear and unlikely to change.\" Under the Asset Protection Scheme, part of the government bailout in the financial crisis, loans worth \u00a3282bn were insured against default by taxpayers, limiting the potential losses to which RBS was exposed.Between 2009 and 2012 the Asset Protection Agency staff were in charge of overseeing the scheme. Its stated goal was \"to maximize the value of the assets in the scheme and reduce the probability of payouts\".Hugh Sims QC, for the former GRG customer, Oliver Morley, told the High Court that internal bank emails disclosed as part of civil proceedings also suggested that within GRG \"things had become increasingly personal.\"In one internal email exchange discussing Mr Morley's attempts to hold on to his business, GRG staff say \"the borrower is toast\". In another they are looking forward to \"the Morley massacre\" the following Tuesday.In another email discussing their proposal to force him to sell his properties to the banks' own property division, GRG staff say if he disagrees \"it's his head on a spike\", the court heard. RBS said it \"fundamentally disagrees with Mr Morley's claims and does not believe they have any merit\". \"It is contesting them vigorously in court. The bank incurred around \u00a330m of losses on the \u00a375m it lent Mr Morley, who was a sophisticated customer in receipt of extensive professional advice.\"However, it added: \"The language used in these internal communications from 2009 was clearly unacceptable and would have no place in the bank we are today. These communications did not reflect or lead to customer detriment.\"While GRG told customers it was there to help them turn around the fortunes of their business, a report, leaked to the BBC in 2017, found the bank was seeking to make profits from distressed businesses and had systematically broken rules on fair treatment of customers. Promontory, the consultants who authored the leaked report, told MPs they were expecting to conduct a further review on which individual culpability would have been examined.However, Financial Conduct Authority chief executive Andrew Bailey said it would conduct its own inquiry. In the summer of 2018, he announced the FCA would not be taking its investigation further, prompting accusations from small business victims of GRG of a cover-up.The evidence unearthed about the Asset Protect Agency's role suggests the executives would have been able to point to government involvement, potentially exposing the Treasury to large compensation claims. In the light of the new evidence, Oliver Morley Estates has given notice that it intends to sue Her Majesty's Treasury for compensation for its role in dismantling its business.The FCA said it would shortly be publishing a full report about the findings of an enforcement investigation into RBS's GRG division.","63":"The Scottish government has committed in principle to introducing a charge on disposable drinks cups - a so-called \"latte levy\" - as part of its budget deal with the Greens. The aim is to reduce the number of single-use coffee and other drinks cups that being are sent to landfill or incinerated every year. Keep Scotland Beautiful estimates that almost 500 million single-use disposable cups are given out in Scotland every year.These paper cups often are not or cannot be recycled - the basic materials which go into them generally are recyclable, but the process of doing it can be complicated, and costly.The Confederation of Paper Industries told MPs that only about 0.25% of these cups actually are recycled, and that \"paper cups cannot be regarded as generally recyclable\".Scottish Green MSP Mark Ruskell said: \"They're very difficult to recycle because they're plastic and cardboard together. They end up being incinerated or in landfill a lot of the time, they end up in our communities as litter or even in the sea.\"The Scottish government has already removed disposable cups from its own buildings, and says this will save 450,000 of them being thrown away every year.Some big coffee shop chains such as Starbucks and Costa have introduced in-store recycling systems and targets. And many shops now offer a discount on hot drinks for customers who bring in or buy re-usable cups, rather than taking disposable ones.However, some campaigners want to go further than this and introduce a charge for each cup given out - similar to the charge for plastic bags in supermarkets, which saw a huge drop in the number of disposable bags issued.Having such a levy could give people an incentive to buy reusable cups, and encourage the industry to come up with alternatives.Given the number of cups given out daily in Scotland, it could also raise a significant sum of money - which could potentially be ploughed back into environmental projects or local efforts to tackle litter.Westminster's environmental audit committee called on the UK government to introduce a 25p charge on disposable cups in 2018, but this was ultimately rejected by Chancellor Philip Hammond.So a levy on these cups in Scotland could be the first of its kind in the UK.One concern is cost. The charge can be passed onto customers via price rises, or swallowed by the company giving out the cups - and some small businesses fear that they couldn't afford either.Gillian Hadden, who runs the Big Baps takeaway van in Aberdeen, told BBC Scotland that her customers \"can't really withstand another price increase\", and that carrying the cost herself would be a \"huge outlay\".This is disputed by Mr Ruskell, who argued that the plastic bag charge \"hasn't been damaging for businesses\".He said: \"We're seeing many coffee houses around Scotland and the UK introducing reusable cups and selling those to consumers, and compostable cups are becoming popular too - so there are opportunities for business here as well.\"There is also an argument that coffee cups are a drop in the ocean of plastic and paper waste, and that efforts might be better focused elsewhere.The UK government has suggested that it would better for shops to offer voluntary discounts to customers bringing their own cups.Rejecting calls for a \"latte levy\" in his Autumn Budget speech in 2018, Mr Hammond said that \"a tax in isolation would not, at this point, deliver a decisive shift from disposable to reuseable cups across all beverage types\".Keep Scotland Beautiful meanwhile has launched the Cup Movement, a campaign in Glasgow to see more disposable cups recycled and a move towards reusable ones.The precise details of the Scottish scheme are still being worked out, but Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has committed \"in principle to the use of charging in relation to disposable drinks cups\", alongside other measures to reduce plastic waste.The plans actually date back to the 2017 Programme for Government, when Nicola Sturgeon appointed an expert panel to \"advise on the use of charges, similar to the successful plastic bag charge\" to \"end the throw-away culture\".An expert panel, led by Dame Sue Bruce, has been examining the issue and is due to report back in the coming months.The Scottish Greens are calling for an initial 25p levy per cup, to increase annually, with the proceeds going to local environmental projects, councils and charities. The government says its plans will \"include consideration of whether revenue from any charge can be placed under the control of local authorities\".Ministers have promised to draw up legislation in the 2019-20 parliamentary year, although it will take some time for this to pass through parliament and be implemented.So it could be 2020 or 2021 before any the new levy actually becomes a reality.","64":"With 25 days until Brexit, the task of narrowing down what will happen next is at the forefront of politicians' minds.MSPs are set to debate withdrawal negotiations for almost four hours on Tuesday afternoon - an unusually lengthy timeslot for the Scottish Parliament.It comes ahead of a series of votes taking place at Westminster next week.If a majority in the House of Commons do not back an alternative, the UK will leave the EU on 29 March without a deal in place.This is an outcome the majority of MSPs hope to avoid.Four of the five parties at Holyrood have now backed an extension of Article 50 and for another referendum to take place.What could be interesting is whether a new line will come from the Scottish Conservative benches.So far Tory MSPs have been foursquare behind the prime minister's deal, warning that this is the only way to prevent a no deal Brexit.What else is happening at Holyrood this week?Bookending the Brexit debate will be topical questions and a member's debate led by Labour MSP Neil Findlay.He is highlighting reports that the Scottish government has declined support from a mesh removal expert.Vaginal mesh implants are used by surgeons to treat conditions which some women suffer from, typically after childbirth.But their use was stopped in 2018 after an implant was listed as an underlying cause of death of a woman in August.Dr Dionysios Veronikis has developed skills and instruments that allow for the full removal of a mesh implant, a procedure not currently available across all health boards.The Scottish government has said the decision to remove mesh is made by the patient and her doctor, with specialist centres located in NHS Greater Glasgow and NHS Lothian.In the morning, Brexit preparation is hotting up with all five committee scheduled to meet considering secondary legislation around it.The economy committee will hear from Economy Secretary Derek Mackay on regulations to bring EU public procurement rules into domestic law.Before this, the committee will be taking evidence from construction experts and apprentices about the impact of the sector on the Scottish economy. The Scottish Tories have the floor on Wednesday afternoon with two debates.The first will cover the early years, while the second will be on rural affairs. Information on the specifics will be published later.Before this, finance and environment ministers will face portfolio questions.The evening's member's debate is being led by SNP MSP Gordon Macdonald, highlighting Marie Curie's 33rd annual great daffodil appeal.In the morning, the education committee continues its inquiry into additional support needs in school education.Its members warned in 2017 that there was a lack of support for children with additional needs in many council areas across Scotland.This inquiry is assessing whether progress has been made in the last two years, taking evidence from two charities - Enable and the National Autistic Society Scotland - as well as the Scottish Secondary Teacher's Association.An hour on Thursday will be spent discussing the Local Government Finance Order, which allocates funding to each of the 32 councils in Scotland for 2019-20.The opposition benches will insist this is not enough while the Scottish government will highlight the amount received by every council will go up.But since the Budget Bill was passed last week, this debate is simply the final part of that process and will not in effect change anything.The weekly performance of first minister's questions takes place at noon - and MSP Alison Johnstone gets her first question as co-leader of the party.Afterwards, SNP MSP Annabelle Ewing leads a debate on settled status fees, which the UK government decided to scrap in January.Rural ministers face portfolio questions at 2pm, in a change of scheduling from its usual Wednesday position.International Women's Day will be marked by MSPs after the council funding debate.In the morning, school children from Parkhead Primary School will give evidence to MSPs about first aid training. They will be joined by representatives from St Andrew's First Aid who are calling for the training to be given to all primary school children.","65":"A council that lost millions of pounds in a loan to a football team has \"learned our lessons\" and agreed to lend \u00a31.5m to the town's rugby team.Most of a \u00a310.25m loan to Northampton Town has never been recovered by the borough council and a police investigation remains ongoing.But the authority has approved plans to lend Northampton Saints money towards the development of its ground.The council cabinet member for finance said he was \"confident\" of repayment.The Premiership club's planned upgrades include creating an indoor training building with artificial turf, upgrading its conferencing and catering facilities and making changes to the car park entrance on Weedon Road. The loan is expected to provide the council with an income of \u00a390,000 a year and councillor Brandon Eldred told a meeting on Wednesday the loan \"made business sense\".\"We have learned our lessons from the past with regards to loans,\" said Mr Eldred, as reported by the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\"We have never had any problem with the Saints, but if the impossible does happen we have some backup and security on some of the club assets. But I am fully confident that they will pay the money back.\"In a report to Northampton Borough Council's cabinet, chief finance officer Stuart McGregor said immediate action could be taken to recover the funds if the rugby club failed to make payments on this new loan and an existing \u00a35.5m loan.Mr McGregor added the application had been discussed with auditor KPMG, which investigated the council following its multimillion-pound loan to the Cobblers.Saints chief executive Mark Darbon told the cabinet meeting that the plans would help towards the club's aim of becoming \"the number one club in Europe\" over the coming years.The Saints are currently ninth in the Premiership table.","66":"Scotland's finance secretary believes better transport links to Glasgow Airport are needed \"as soon as possible\".Derek Mackay said a now discarded plan for a rail service \"hasn't been deemed perfect\" and another was needed.Bosses at Glasgow Airport said it was the only one of its kind in Europe reliant on road access.However, Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken said an investment in a direct rail link was a \"massive risk\".That proposal was announced as part of the \u00a31.13bn Glasgow City Region deal agreed in 2014 and was expected to be operational by 2025.But after several delays and concerns, it now looks like there will be a different option.Glasgow Airport is located in Mr Mackay's Renfrewshire North and West constituency, and he said the issue was a matter for the City Deal board, which includes Glasgow and Renfrewshire councils.He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"The tram train rail project hasn't been deemed as perfect and I think that's why the City Deal board and other key stakeholders and partners are looking at the best form of transport.\"A lot of people didn't appreciate that the plans as they stood at the moment would have severely impacted the Inverclyde and Ayrshire lines as well as adding to the pressures on Glasgow Central.\"The minister added: \"I think it is right to reflect on what is best to give Glasgow airport improved connectivity.\"Much of that we can get on with now, whether it's priority lanes in terms of the motorway, or other interventions.\"I am attracted to the new projects that have been put forward - so we will get on with it, but we want to get it right.\"Mr Mackay added: \"I do think there's a better solution and I want to get on with that better solution as quickly as possible.\"Glasgow Airport bosses have said action to improve transport links with the city centre is needed urgently.Ms Aitken said she was committed to finding a solution.An improved link between the airport and Paisley Gilmour Street train station has been put forward as one alternative.However, former Glasgow council leader Frank McAveety said that not pursuing a rail link between the centre of Glasgow and the airport was a \"betrayal\" of the city.He added that the Glasgow Airport Rail Link project should be put \"back on track\".Follow BBC presenter Andrew Black's business updates each weekday morning on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme between 0600 and 0900.","67":"Prosecutors in Manhattan have ordered the Trump inaugural committee to hand over documents relating to how the team raised and spent over $100m (\u00a377m).The subpoena requests a wide range of data regarding who donated to the inauguration, whether they were non-US citizens, and how the money was spent.White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told CNN on Tuesday that the order has \"nothing to do with the president\".The subpoena, which has not been made public, does not allege any wrongdoing.\"We have just received a subpoena for documents,\" a spokeswoman for the Trump inaugural committee told US media. \"While we are still reviewing the subpoena, it is our intention to co-operate with the inquiry.\"According to federal election law, foreign nationals are prohibited from donating to a US inaugural committee.The investigation is separate from special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of possible Trump campaign ties to Russia, an investigation that has led to several indictments and guilty pleas.The subpoena from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office grew out of the campaign finance prosecution of Michael Cohen, President Trump's ex-personal lawyer.The investigation into Cohen, who is due to begin a prison sentence next month after implicating Mr Trump, arose from a referral from Mr Mueller's team to New York prosecutors.According to ABC News, prosecutors are also requesting information about who attended inaugural events as Mr Trump was sworn into office in January 2017 and whether they were promised photo-ops with the president-elect, ABC News reports.Tom Barrack Jr, a real-estate developer and close friend of the president who served as chairman of the inaugural committee, is not named in the documents.The only man named is Imaad Zuberi, a former fundraiser for Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton whose company gave $900,000 to the committee.A spokesman for Mr Zuberi said he had given \"generously and directly\" to the inaugural committee, but added that many others donated \"substantially more\".According to the Wall Street Journal, Mr Zuberi had several conversations with Cohen about access to inaugural events.In 2014, Mr Zuberi registered as a lobbyist for Sri Lanka.","68":"US President Donald Trump has nominated David Malpass as his pick for the next World Bank president.So who is David Malpass, and what opinions does he hold?Mr Malpass, a Trump loyalist, was a senior economic adviser to the US president during his 2016 election campaign.The 62-year-old has criticised the World Bank in the past, along with other institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, for being \"intrusive\" and \"entrenched\".After senior roles in the US Treasury during the Reagan and George HW Bush administrations, Mr Malpass became chief economist at Bear Stearns bank.  He was there for 15 years before the bank's near collapse in the 2008 banking crisis.Bear Stearns narrowly avoided insolvency in March of that year after hedge funds got spooked by the investment bank's exposure to subprime mortgages. It was bought by rival JP Morgan for a fraction of its former value, with the backing of the US Federal Reserve.Mr Malpass left Bear Stearns three months later.He was subsequently criticised for an August 2007 Wall Street Journal article in which he urged investors not to panic about the credit market.\"Housing and debt markets are not that big a part of the US economy, or of job creation,\" Mr Malpass wrote before the impending economic crisis. \"It's more likely the economy is sturdy and will grow solidly in coming months, and perhaps years.\"The New York Times also criticised Mr Malpass for that and other Wall Street Journal articles, saying partisan bias towards Republican policy by economists had \"unquestionably contributed to their forecast errors\".After leaving Bear Stearns in 2008, Mr Malpass founded research group Encima Global, and held a number of directorships at finance firms.In August 2017 Mr Malpass again took up a senior role at the US Treasury, becoming undersecretary for international affairs.Since then Mr Malpass has pushed for the World Bank to halt lending to China, which he says is too wealthy to deserve such aid, and has harsh lending practices to other countries.And last year, he was part of negotiations over a package of World Bank lending reforms.The US agreed to back a plan for shareholders to inject $13bn (\u00a310bn) into the World Bank and its private lending arm, with conditions that aimed to limit the bank's lending, and focus resources more on poorer countries.The reforms are aimed at pushing more middle-income countries towards private sector lending, and limiting World Bank staff salary growth.To become World Bank president Mr Malpass has to win approval from the institution's executive board, which has 25 members. The US holds a 16% share of board voting power and has traditionally chosen the World Bank's leader.China is the World Bank's third-largest shareholder after Japan, with about a 4.5% share of voting power.Justin Sandefur, a senior fellow with the Center for Global Development, said the nomination of Mr Malpass showed that the Trump administration was trying to undermine a key global institution, and urged other countries to nominate alternative candidates.\"They have a choice. It's a simple majority vote, the US has no veto in this election and there are many better candidates,\" Mr Sandefur said.","69":"Next's annual sales and profits at its High Street stores have continued their fall of recent years, while its online business continues to grow. Sales in Next's stores fell nearly 8% last year to \u00a31.95bn, while online sales rose by 14.7% to \u00a31.92bn.It said online was a \"long-term threat\" to its High Street business, but a \"larger opportunity\" for the group.The retailer also said it could see \"no evidence\" that Brexit uncertainty was affecting consumer behaviour. Overall, Next's group pre-tax profits for the year to January were in line with expectations at \u00a3722.9m, a fall of 0.4%.Annual profits at its High Street stores fell by just over 20%, while online profits jumped by nearly 14%.Total group sales, including the finance division, rose by 2.5% to \u00a34.22bn.Next said 53% of its sales were now online.It said the growth of online sales \"represents a long-term threat to our retail business but potentially, a much larger opportunity for the group as a whole\".Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said the difference between the fortunes of the stores and online was becoming \"increasingly marked\". \"The online business, which has long been the jewel in the crown, continues its growth apace with full-price sales increasing nearly 15% over the period.\"The fact that there is a slow transition to this channel... is of comfort, even though the additional costs of transferring in the form of warehouse picking and delivery, need to be carefully managed.\"Chairman Lord Wolfson, a prominent supporter of Brexit, said the retailer could see \"no evidence\" that Brexit uncertainty was \"affecting consumer behaviour in our sector\".\"Our feeling is that there is a level of fatigue around the subject that leaves consumers numb to the daily swings in the political debate.\"If the UK government's provisional tariff rates were introduced in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Lord Wolfson said Next had estimated there would be a net reduction in the tariffs it pays of about \u00a312m-\u00a315m, as tariffs on goods imported from outside the EU fell. In the \"medium term\", Next's intention would be to pass on price cuts to customers. \"In the context of \u00a31.7bn of stock purchases, the savings would be relatively modest,\" he added.Julie Palmer, an analyst at Begbies Traynor, said Next \"continues to impress\": \"The continuing success of its online and catalogue offering means the retailer has a significant advantage over its competitors, and continued investment in its online offering will guarantee future success. \"However it is not all plain sailing for this iconic retailer, with it suffering from a double whammy of falling High Street sales combined with higher staff wages which will continue to impact its financial performance. As such High Street store closures are on the cards in the coming year.\"In its results statement, Next spelt out in some detail what it expects to happen to its store portfolio in the coming years. It said its stores were still a \"valuable financial asset and an increasingly important\" part of its online business. It pointed out it costs it less to deliver online orders to stores than to customers' homes and that more than half of online orders were delivered to stores, while more than 80% of returns were through stores. However, in what might be seen as a warning to landlords it said that while retail costs were fixed in the short term, they were \"likely to decline in the longer run\".\"We are often asked 'how much less space will you need in the future?' It is the wrong question. We do not have too much space, we have too much rent, rates and service charge.\"\"The amount of retail space we trade in the future will depend on whether the cost of retail space adequately reflects the reality of retail trading conditions.  Our guess is that there will be shops in fifteen years' time, but they will be fewer in number, possibly smaller and MUCH less expensive.\"As an example, Next said last year it had negotiated a rent cut of 29% on the leases it renewed.\"We experienced a reduction of 25% on leases renewed in the previous year and we expect similar reductions in the year ahead.\" ","70":"Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot has become embroiled in a row with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the status of the country's Arab minority.\"Love your neighbour as yourself,\" the Israeli actress said, amid wrangling over the role of Israeli Arab parties in upcoming polls.Mr Netanyahu caused a stir when he said Israel \"was not a state of all its citizens\", referring to Arabs who make up 20% of its population.He cited a \"nation-state\" law. The legislation sparked controversy last year.Arab MPs reacted furiously in July when Israel's parliament approved the legislation, which says Jews have a unique right to national self-determination in the country and puts Hebrew above Arabic as the official language.The spat began on Saturday, when Israeli actress and TV presenter Rotem Sela challenged comments made by Culture Minister Miri Regev in a TV interview about the role of Arab parties in the 9 April general election. Ms Regev repeated a warning by her and Mr Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party that voters should not choose its main rivals because they might form a governing coalition that included Arab MPs.\"What is the problem with the Arabs?\" Sela questioned in an Instagram story.\"When the hell will someone in this government convey to the public that Israel is a state of all its citizens and that all people were created equal, and that even the Arabs and the Druze and the LGBTs and - shock - the leftists are human.\" On Sunday, Mr Netanyahu responded with an Instagram post of his own that referred to the \"nation-state\" law.\"Dear Rotem,\" he wrote. \"Israel is not a state of all its citizens. According to the basic nationality law we passed, Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people - and only it.\"\"As you wrote, there is no problem with the Arab citizens of Israel. They have equal rights like all of us and the Likud government has invested more in the Arab sector than any other government,\" he added.According to AFP news agency, Mr Netanyahu later brought up the issue at a cabinet meeting. He called Israel a \"Jewish, democratic state\" with equal rights, but the \"nation state not of all its citizens but only of the Jewish people\".The Wonder Woman star defended the comments posted by Sela, who is reported to be a close friend.\"This isn't a matter of right or left. Jew or Arab. Secular or religious,\" she told her 28.3m followers on Instagram.\"It's a matter of dialogue, of dialogue for peace and equality and of our tolerance of one towards the other.\"President Reuven Rivlin also appeared to get involved in the debate on Monday.Without mentioning any names, Mr Rivlin condemned what he said were recent \"entirely unacceptable remarks about the Arab citizens of Israel\". Arab MPs also praised Sela's comments, the Times of Israel reports, including Ayman Odeh who said: \"Rotem Sela, we don't know each other but bravo.\"Mr Netanyahu's critics say comments like those made by Ms Regev are part of a bid to court right-wing voters. Likud is facing a serious challenge to its re-election hopes with a rival centrist Blue and White alliance, led by ex-military chief Benny Gantz and ex-Finance Minister Yair Lapid, ahead in the polls.The prime minister has also come under increased pressure since the attorney general announced last month his intention to file corruption charges against him, pending a final hearing that will take place after the election. At the last election four years ago, Mr Netanyahu apologised after warning that \"right-wing rule is in danger\" because \"the Arabs are voting in droves\".Israeli Arabs, descendants of the 160,000 Palestinians who remained after the State of Israel was created in 1948, have long complained of being treated as second-class citizens.They say they face discrimination and worse provision than Israeli Jews when it comes to services such as education, health and housing.","71":"The private company that ran CairnGorm mountain went bust in November leaving behind a broken mountain railway and a failed plan to bring millions of pounds of much-needed investment to the snowsports centre near Aviemore. What went wrong?From the beginning some people said what was promised at CairnGorm Mountain was too good to be true. When Natural Retreats - a company until then most identified with running a holiday rentals company - took over, it promised a transformation. Publicity material said the aspiration was to host the X games, a world-famous extreme sports event, and produce multiple gold medals at the Winter Olympics by creating a world class training facility.That would have represented a major turnaround for any Scottish resort - never mind one that had struggled to overcome problems caused by the unpredictability of the weather and the need to find a revenue stream that could support a \u00a320m mountain railway.When the company that ran the mountain went bust last autumn much of the focus understandably was on protecting jobs and making sure there was a ski season of some sort this winter. But we wanted to try to understand what happened, whether it was preventable and what could be learned from it.That meant unpicking a complicated web of public bodies, private companies and unmet expectations.Even working out who owned what wasn't simple.The infrastructure on the mountain - the lifts and railway - are in public hands.Highlands and Islands Enterprise owns them and the land. Until 2014 they ran the mountain through an operating company - CairnGorm Mountain Limited.That year they announced that Natural Retreats were taking over. They were a leisure company who had started off developing holiday rentals in national parks. The operating company - along with assets like vehicles and movable infrastructure on the hill - were sold for just over \u00a3230,000.We can see from the original tender document that financial backing was crucial to getting the contract.It says: \"The potential operator would be required to provide capital investment to support their business model. Consequently bidders will be expected to demonstrate a credible access to finance.\"Almost immediately bloggers who were critical of the management of the mountain started digging away. They discovered that the company had in fact been sold to Natural Assets Investments Limited (NAIL) - a company with many of the same directors as Natural Retreats. Natural Retreats had the lease to operate the mountain - but the assets had been transferred to the wider group. NAIL was also in debt. HIE has since said financial checks were done on both companies.In a 2014 media release, HIE welcomed Natural Retreats' decision to invest more than \u00a36m in the mountain. This was the key to the deal - sell the operating company and release private capital to allow the mountain to diversify. The hope was that there would be an investment in the ski business. But more than that the intention was to develop the summer business too - this would protect the mountain from the ups and downs of weather-affected skiing.Our research has established that this \u00a36m wasn't quite what it seemed. When we sat down with HIE they told us that \u00a34m of that was to be a loan of public money from HIE to Natural Retreats. Two years after the handover Natural Retreats still hadn't taken that up. The company came to HIE and said that they wanted to change the business model which had won them the original contract. HIE approved a new business plan but that investment didn't happen either. Highland and Islands Enterprise told us that Natural Retreats invested about \u00a31m in the Day Lodge on the mountain. So the whole basis for the asset transfer was never realised.As we spoke to local people who had investigated Natural Retreats' time on the mountain it became clear the concern wasn't simply what hadn't been invested, it was also what had been taken out.Natural Assets Investment Limited and Natural Retreats share directors. There are also other leisure companies registered at Companies House where the same names come up over and over again. Their accounts show a complex system of inter-company charging. This isn't unusual or in any way wrong. The structure of an operating company and a property company that charge between each other is common in the leisure industry.But what people wanted to know was if Natural Retreats wasn't investing as originally planned, was it also taking money out? That's where the Administrator's Statement came in handy. It's a document produced by those charged with realising the assets of a company that has gone into administration and settling its debts.It said that there was a monthly \"management fee\" paid from the operating company CairnGorm Mountain Limited to Natural Retreats of \u00a340,000. When we asked HIE about that they confirmed that had been negotiated at the point of handover and represented an industry standard level of fee.There were other payments in the accounts that stood out. CairnGorm Mountain Limited was paying administration charges to the wider NAIL Group. These amounted to more than \u00a32m in the period 2014 to 2017. That's more than the management fees that were signed off by HIE as part of the asset transfer. What were these for?We asked HIE and they said they didn't know - but were still trying to find out. Which brings us to Natural Retreats.We had a lot of questions. In particular we wanted to know about the flow of money in and out of Cairngorm Mountain Limited. We put them all to the company - which seems to have rebadged itself as Travel Together in the past two weeks. They were not willing to answer any of them, saying that relevant information was in the public domain. They also said that ongoing investigations into the fate of the funicular meant they were not in a position to comment.There was other information in the administrator's statement that raises questions about the relationship between HIE and Natural Retreats. It makes clear what happened when Natural Retreats realised that a combination of the funicular being out of operation and other factors meant administration was inevitable.HIE entered a process where it was the sole bidder to take the operation of the mountain back over. It put in more than \u00a3150,000 of public money to cover the November wage bill. Then it negotiated a deal to buy the assets of CairnGorm Mountain back. At this point the funicular was out of operation and HIE was the only bidder. It paid over \u00a3440,000. That's almost twice the original price paid by NAIL.How would HIE explain paying double when the ski operation was struggling to cope with the loss of the funicular? They told us they were securing important assets for the future and that they had paid a fair price. They also said that the original sale had involved a transfer of a company with debts as well as assets and that was reflected in the price in 2014. The agency was clear - it's role was to protect the future viability of the mountain.HIE also told us that over the period Natural Retreats was in charge, HIE spent an additional \u00a33.5m of public money on infrastructure. If the original intention of the handover was to bring private capital into the picture and relieve pressure on public funds then what's detailed in the administrator's statement, combined with what HIE told us, suggests that there was far more public cash than private cash being invested. There is one last potential twist. When Cairngorm Mountain went into administration it owed more than \u00a32m to the NAIL Group. That makes the company by far the largest unsecured creditor. So whatever is realised by the administrators could largely be paid back to NAIL.Over the last week or so we've seen winter return to our mountains with a vengeance. That holds out hope for all our ski resorts, including CairnGorm. As the wider impact of CairnGorm Mountain Limited going into administration becomes clear the immediate worst case scenarios have not appeared. Jobs have been protected, skiing is happening this winter and there are negotiations under way with community groups about the potential for a community buy-out.Nevertheless, it's still not at all clear that the past four years represent anything other than a wasted opportunity for a business dependent on public money and crucial to the future of a community that desperately needs it to succeed. ","72":"A report into the impact of Brexit on banking and finance firms says some \u00a3900bn in financial firms' assets have been moved out of the UK.It adds this has cost \u00a33bn-4bn and involves 5,000 expected staff moves or local hires, and that figure will rise. The study, by capital markets think tank New Financial, says 275 firms have moved some or all of their business with Dublin the most popular location.It says the hit to London was bigger than expected and would get worse.\"Business will continue to leak from London to the EU, with more activity being booked through local subsidiaries,\" said William Wright, founder and managing director of New Financial.He said this would weaken the UK's current pre-eminence in financial services and would damage tax receipts.The think tank, which campaigns for Europe to have bigger capital markets, says its report is the most comprehensive study of its type yet.Its report said a 10% shift in banking and finance transactions would cut income from tax receipts by about 1%.Its report highlights:It did add, though, that arrangements made between regulators in the EU and the UK meant the industry was well prepared for whatever form Brexit took.New Financial breaks down what it calls its \"conservative estimates\", and says banks and investment banks are moving around \u00a3800bn in assets, asset managers have so far transferred more than \u00a365bn in funds and insurance companies have so far moved \u00a335bn in assets.","73":"New Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar has apologised for tweets implying US lawmakers only support Israel because of lobby money.She faced widespread condemnation for suggesting the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) was buying influence for pro-Israel policies.Republicans and Democrats alike said the tweets stoked anti-Semitic tropes about Jews and money.The Minnesota lawmaker has previously been accused of anti-Semitism.Ms Omar released a statement \"unequivocally\" apologising for her tweets on Monday, following an apparent conversation with Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi about the row.\"Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes,\" Ms Omar said.\"We have to always be willing to step back and think through criticism, just as I expect people to hear me when others attack me for my identity.\"Ms Omar added that she still believes lobbyists are \"problematic\" in US politics - \"whether it be Aipac, the NRA or the fossil fuel industry\".In response to a tweet on Sunday from a journalist questioning why US political leaders always defend Israel, Ms Omar used a slang term for $100 bills, writing: \"it's all about the Benjamins baby.\"When challenged where she thought such money was coming from, the 36-year-old Somali-American tweeted back: \"Aipac.\" Aipac spends millions of dollars a year lobbying lawmakers and the US federal government to adopt pro-Israel policies, according to campaign-finance monitors. Aipac's website says it offers a congressional club membership that requires \"political contributions in a clearly pro-Israel context to candidates\".However, it is one of countless special interest groups in Washington DC that advocate on issues covering everything from abortion to gun control, unions, energy, defence, healthcare and beyond. In response to Ms Omar, Aipac tweeted: \"Our bipartisan efforts are reflective of American values and interests.\"Ms Omar - who in November became one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress - has been criticised before for criticisms of Israel.She has come under fire for supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS), which seeks to isolate Israel economically to force it to change its policies towards the Palestinians.Last month, Ms Omar apologised for saying Israel had \"hypnotised\" the world - a term once used by Nazis.She said she had not been aware of the historical context.Republicans have criticised Ms Omar over her latest controversy, but the backlash was just as intense from congressional members of her own party.House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders released a statement on Monday condemning the tweets and calling on Ms Omar to \"immediately apologise for these hurtful comments\".\"Legitimate criticism of Israel's policies is protected by the values of free speech and democratic debate that the United States and Israel share.\"But Congresswoman Omar's use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel's supporters is deeply offensive.\"The statement was also signed by Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries and vice-chair Katherine Clark, Majority Whip James Clyburn, and Assistant House Speaker Ben Ray Lujan.Mrs Pelosi also indicated she had spoken with Ms Omar about the controversy.Max Rose, a New York Democrat, called Ms Omar's remarks \"deeply hurtful\".House Judiciary chairman Jerry Nadler, also of New York, said Ms Omar's choice of words was \"deeply disappointing and disturbing\".Elaine Luria of Virginia and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey on Monday published a letter urging House leaders to \"unite against anti-Semitism and hateful tropes and stereotypes\".The letter did not name Ms Omar, but said top Democrats must confront lawmakers who make \"reckless statements\".Chelsea Clinton, daughter of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, tweeted: \"We should expect all elected officials, regardless of party, and all public figures to not traffic in anti-Semitism.\"Ms Omar later responded to Ms Clinton by saying she would be \"happy to talk\", adding \"we must call out smears from the [Republican party] and their allies\".House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy was quick to call for action against Ms Omar.Mr McCarthy himself faced condemnation last year for a now-deleted tweet that suggested billionaire Jewish donors were attempting to \"buy\" the mid-term elections.","74":"China's ambitious plan to develop the so-called Greater Bay Area is designed to spur the economy, but analysts question whether its lofty goals can be achieved, as the BBC's Ana Nicolaci da Costa explains. The Greater Bay Area plan, unveiled this week, would link Hong Kong, Macau and nine other cities in southern China. The project aims to foster growth in the world's second largest economy by developing technology and innovation, boosting infrastructure and increasing financial links between the cities. Some say China is trying to create an innovation cluster to rival the likes of Silicon Valley. The Greater Bay Area region is already very important to China. It is home to about 70 million people, produces 37% of the country's exports and 12% of its gross domestic product, according to HSBC. China hopes closer integration of the region's cities can boost that output further. The plan aims to develop technology, deepen links between financial systems and infrastructure, while securing quality of life. Some of the infrastructure projects are already under way. Chinese President Xi Jinping last year officially opened a bridge connecting Hong Kong to Macau and the mainland Chinese city of Zhuhai - the world's longest sea crossing bridge - as part of China's plan to connect Greater Bay Area.The blueprint lays out strategic visions for the major cities in the region to become hubs in different sectors, reports say. Hong Kong would strengthen its status as a finance and trade hub, Shenzhen - home to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei - would consolidate as a tech hub, while Macau would focus on tourism and trade with the Portuguese-speaking world.\"If you think about the cities that are included in the Greater Bay Area... they are complementary to each other,\" says Albert Hu, associate professor at the National University of Singapore.Prof Hu says it \"makes a lot of sense to try to improve connectivity between these cities\".\"If all these things could be implemented, I think the area would be more productive than the sum of the individual cities.\" The plan also highlights the central government's goal of improving innovation capacity in the region, developing modern services and promoting offshore business, says Yue Su, China economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.But Ms Su says the \"vagueness\" of the 11-chapter document \"suggests that officials will struggle to realise the initiative's goals\".The whole region stands to benefit from a more integrated market with easier movement of people and resources, analysts say.For Hong Kong, greater integration could boost its role as a global trade and financial centre. It could even ease demand on its red-hot housing market, if it encourages and makes it easier for Hong Kong citizens to move to the mainland.But closer economic integration could be challenging for a region with different customs, legal systems and public services, they say.\"An enormous amount of red tape related to transport, customs, immigration will need to be cut to make it actually easy to move people, goods and money between these areas,\" says Martin Chorzempa, research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. The plan has also sparked some concern about the \"one country, two systems\" framework which gives Hong Kong a high degree of freedom in political, economic and legal matters.\"Hong Kong's prosperity is founded on global recognition of its autonomy from China,\" Ms Su says. \"A potential growing influence of the central Chinese government over the territory is likely to bring concerns to Hong Kong's major trade partners.\" The apparent focus on technology and innovation has drawn comparisons between the Greater Bay Area and California's Silicon Valley. But analysts say the region has a long way to go to compete with the US tech hub, if that is indeed its aim.\"China tech firms are only worth about a third as much as America's. They also generate relatively little revenue abroad,\" Ms Su says.Others say the comparison is ill-conceived, or amounts to comparing apples and oranges.\"It's not comparable,\" says Adam Xu, partner at global strategy consulting firm OC&C in Shanghai. \"The biggest difference is this development is very planned or guided, while the other is very market-driven,\" Mr Xu says. \"The aim of the plan is to grow the regional economy rather than competing with Silicon Valley per se.\"","75":"Glasgow City Council has approved plans to finance a \u00a3548m equal pay settlement by selling off major venues to an arm's length body and leasing them back. The proposal involves transferring ownership of prominent buildings such as the Riverside Museum and the Emirates arena to a council-owned body.It will take out long-term loans against the value of the venues.They will then be rented back to the council with the cost of the lease designed to meet the loan repayments.Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken told BBC Scotland the annual cost of the deal, which includes interest rates, was likely to be about \u00a325m annually for \"years to come\". The council needs to raise about \u00a3548m to settle equal pay claims from thousands of women going back more than a decade.Ms Aitken, who inherited the liability for the claims when her SNP administration took over from Labour in May 2017, said she was \"delighted\" to have won backing for the deal.She said it \"finally delivers pay justice for thousands of women in our workforce\".Ms Aitken said the claims would start to be settled this summer.She added that it \"starts to put right a wrong that has damaged the council, its workforce and the city for too long\".Under proposals, the following venues would be transferred to the City Property portfolio:The deal agreed by councillors on Glasgow's City Administration Committee will transfer ownership of proposed venues to City Property Glasgow Investments LLP (CPGI), a company owned by the council, which would pay for them by remortgaging them.Glasgow City Council insisted the buildings would remain in the city's ownership and users would not see any difference in how they accessed them on a day-to-day basis.However, the council will have a substantial annual bill for decades to pay back the money it has borrowed.Ms Aitken told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"It will be challenging and over time we may have to make some difficult decisions but we are confident that we can balance our budget without having to make very drastic cuts.\"She said service reform and partnerships will be used to meet the costs of the deal.She also told the programme some buildings which are not \"fit for purpose\" might be closed and alternative arrangements put in place to replace lost services.The legacy of the plan, which addresses claims debating back more than a decade, will cast a shadow over the council's finances for some time.Ms Aitken said: \"It is something that the council will be paying for for years to come and we will be paying at a high rate for years to come.\"It's better that we are paying it for years to come than attempting to do it all in a  short period of time.\"That really would have an impact on services in communities in Glasgow.\"It is better that, like any mortgage, we do it over a period of time.\" Ms Aitken said the Scottish government has been \"extremely helpful\" but confirmed she has not been offered any money.She added: \"The people of Scotland shouldn't have to pay for Glasgow's mistakes. \"Other local authorities have settled equal pay liabilities on their own.\"This is Glasgow's problem. It is up to Glasgow to fix.\"","76":"\"I stand here before you tonight, as your Congresswoman-elect, with many firsts behind my name.\"Supporters greeted Ilhan Omar's emotional victory speech with rapturous applause when the Democrat won Minnesota's fifth congressional district in November 2018.The 37-year-old mother of three is the first Somali-American, first African-born American, and one of the first two Muslim American women to serve in the US Congress. Ms Omar has drawn adoration and criticism since that election success as one of a new generation of young politicians shaking up the status quo in Washington DC.She recently clashed with the US envoy to Venezuela, in a clip that has since gone viral. But while she has won support for her approach on Capitol Hill, she has also faced repeated accusations of anti-Semitism, and even allegations of campaign finance violations in Minnesota. Ms Omar was born the youngest of seven siblings in Somalia's capital Mogadishu in 1981. Her mother died when she was two years old.Raised by her father and grandfather, the family fled the country during the Somali Civil War and spent four years in a Kenyan refugee camp before moving to the US in 1995. Originally working in education, she began her political career managing city council campaigns and working as a senior policy aide for Minnesota politicians.In 2016 she won election to the state's legislature - unseating a 44-year incumbent in the process.Ms Omar told the BBC in a 2017 interview that young people who \"believed more in my platform, my ideas, and the merit of what I stood for\" drove her to run.\"A lot of the elders and mainly the women in the community thought it would be better... if I took a back seat,\" she said. \"A refugee girl came here and achieved the American dream,\" Somali refugee Awmam Mahdi told the BBC. \"I think it's very positive for everyone who is an immigrant,\" the Ohio resident said, calling her a \"role model\".Ms Omar supports policies like greater healthcare coverage, more background checks for gun buyers, and abolishing the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.During her victory speech she gave a powerful rebuke to the Trump administrations immigration stance, declaring: \"Here in Minnesota, we don't only welcome immigrants - we send them to Washington\".The president had previously told Minnesotans Somali immigrants there were \"spreading their extremist views\" and joining the so-called Islamic State group.She drew praise for fighting to change a 181-year ban on headwear in the House of Representatives, allowing her to wear a hijab for her oath of office, and holds a place on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Politicians and analysts have identified her with of a number of young Democratic politicians disrupting the status quo on Capitol Hill. Both 29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Palestinian-American woman Rashida Tlaib - one of the first Muslim women in Congress, alongside Ms Omar - were also elected in November 2018.Ms Ocasio-Cortez tweeted her support for Ms Omar after a testy exchange with US special representative for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, went viral.During a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing Ms Omar brought up Mr Abrams role in the Iran-Contra scandal, in which the US secretly sold weapons to Iran and funnelled the proceeds to Nicaraguan anti-Communist groups. She also questioned Mr Abrams comments on US policy in El Salvador, including when he seemingly downplayed a massacre in the town of El Mozote in 1981. \"Watching her question Trump's envoy... feels like justice,\" Ms Ocasio-Cortez wrote.Mr Abrams called the exchange \"ridiculous\" and said he would not respond to a \"personal attack\".\"I don't think this entire line of questioning is meant to be real questions and so I will not reply,\" he said during the hearing.  But for all her fans, Ms Omar has not had the easiest start in Washington DC.She has been repeatedly embroiled in controversy over remarks critics have called anti-Semitic.A 2012 post of hers resurfaced in which she claimed Israel had \"hypnotised the world\", provoking outrage for what many saw as an offensive characterisation of Jewish people. The controversy deepened when she attacked the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), claiming the lobby group is paying politicians to vote for pro-Israel policies.Republicans and Democrats condemned her comments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attacked Ms Omar's \"prejudicial accusations\" and demanded an immediate apology.She later did so, tweeting a statement saying she had colleagues \"educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes\". But the controversy continued when Ms Omar, speaking at a Washington DC event in March, questioned what she termed \"the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country\" - in reference to pro-Israel lobbying.People from both parties again criticised the remarks, saying they played on anti-Semitic tropes of Jewish Americans having divided loyalties - though Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren all spoke out in her defence amid the furore.Mr Sanders in a statement said people should not \"equate anti-Semitism with legitimate criticism of the right-wing, Netanyahu government in Israel\".President Trump has called on her to resign from Congress and \"certainly\" from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, calling the congresswoman \"terrible\". Ms Omar wrote a tweet in response, saying: \"You have trafficked in hate your whole life\".\"I learned from people impacted by my words. When will you?\"Ms Omar, like her colleague Ms Tlaib, has also previously expressed support for the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which urges a complete boycott of Israel over its policies towards the Palestinians.Israel says BDS opposes Israel's very existence and is motivated by anti-Semitism.But investigative journalist Alex Kotch, who wrote an opinion piece in The Guardian after Ms Omar's comments, argues that her criticism of AIPAC and support for the BDS movement are justified.\"What she did in calling out AIPAC is an important thing,\" he told the BBC, saying it is \"almost forbidden\" to say anything critical of Israel in US politics and that Ms Omar was exercising her right to criticise a powerful lobby group.\"We have to be able to distinguish between real anti-Semitism and criticism of Israel,\" he said. \"Her critics are blowing this way out of proportion.\"Ms Omar's time in state government was not without controversy either.Minnesota Representative Steve Drazkowski alleges Ms Omar used campaign funds in her local election run to pay her personal lawyer, as well as to take multiple trips around the US and one trip abroad to Estonia which were unrelated to her election campaign.\"She just doesn't respect the law,\" Mr Drazkowski told the BBC. The Republican lawmaker says both complaints are now under full investigation by Minnesota's Campaign Finance Board, although a spokesperson for the board told the BBC it does not confirm or deny any complaints or investigations.But Ms Omar told the local StarTribune newspaper that Mr Drazkowski has \"an insane obsession with what is in my files\".Her campaign at the time said Mr Drazkowski's allegations are politically motivated and told the Associated Press that \"it should be concerning to his constituents that he is using taxpayer dollars to harass a Muslim candidate\".","77":"The former co-owner of Charlton Athletic Football Club will have to reveal details of his tax affairs to HMRC, the Court of Appeal has ruled.Tony Jimenez, who has also been a vice-president at Newcastle United, claimed a request for information was invalid because he lived in Dubai.A judicial review quashed the original request, but HMRC launched an appeal.It has now won, with Lord Justice Leggatt rejecting the idea the notice \"offends the sovereignty\" of a state.HM Revenue & Customs had asked Mr Jimenez to reveal his bank and credit card accounts since 6 April 2004, and provide a list of his visits to the UK between that date and 5 April 2013.It also made a request \"about the use of chauffeurs when visiting the UK\", the High Court heard in October 2017.His lawyers argued he lived in Cyprus for much of that time period, and the schedule of the Finance Act HMRC used was not applicable to people residing abroad.Mr Justice Charles ruled the notice \"was not lawfully given\" and overturned the request.HMRC then went to the Court of Appeal arguing it did not breach international law, and three judges agreed.The hearing was also told that both Mr Jimenez's \"past and present tax position\" was under investigation by HMRC.Mr Jimenez is no stranger to court action - billionaire Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United, is suing him alleging he breached a contract over a \u00a33m investment in a golf course near Orleans, France.Last July Mr Ashley won a \"comprehensive victory\" in the High Court over an alleged \u00a315m deal made with investment banker Jeffrey Blue in a London pub.Mr Jimenez, who was at Newcastle United under Mr Ashley before leaving in 2008, was involved in a similar dispute with ex-England international Dennis Wise, with whom he also worked with at the club.","78":"Business groups are \"exasperated\" after the Prime Minister's EU withdrawal plan was again rejected by Parliament.They called on MPs to shut down the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and come up with a clear EU exit plan. The City UK, the finance industry body, said leaving without a deal \"would be an own goal of historic proportions\".The government is set to publish more details of its no-deal plans on Wednesday, including trade tariffs and Irish border proposals.CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said the extension of the Brexit process \"should be as short as realistically possible and backed by a clear plan\".\"It's time for Parliament to stop this circus,\" she added.Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturers' group Make UK, said: \"It is now essential that Parliament brings the curtain down on this farce and removes the risk of no deal.\"That outcome would be disastrous for the UK manufacturing, jeopardising many thousands of jobs in every constituency in the land.\"The government is set to publish more details of its no-deal plans, including tariff rates, on Wednesday.Last week, reports suggested that should the UK leave the EU with no deal in place, the UK government might cut trade tariffs on between 80% and 90% of goods.And on Tuesday, Theresa May said that no-deal plans for the Irish border would be released on Wednesday.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said the public would be hit by no-deal Brexit in the form of tariffs, non-tariff barriers and currency depreciation.These would \"all push up costs and reduce the choice on the shelves we currently enjoy,\" she said.She added that businesses are \"exasperated by the lack of clarity over their future trading arrangements\".\"Hundreds of ships are currently sailing towards Britain without a clear understanding of the tariffs, checks, or documentation requirements, they will face when they arrive,\" she said.Mike Hawes, chief executive of car industry body the SMMT, said the vote to reject Mrs May's deal \"leaves us perilously close to the 'cliff edge'.\"\"No-deal would be catastrophic for the automotive industry,\" he said.\"It would end frictionless trade, add billions to the cost of manufacturing and cost jobs.\"UK automotive businesses will be put at immediate risk. Parliament must reject no-deal and take it permanently off the table,\" he added.The pound was volatile ahead of the Commons vote on Tuesday, sinking after the government's senior law officer said the legal risk of the UK being tied to EU rules after Brexit remained unchanged.It regained some ground after the vote, but settled lower.Andrew Wilson, Europe, Middle East and Africa chief executive of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said:\"We expect the British pound, which has reversed last night's strength over the course of the day, to weaken further amid prolonged uncertainty.\"That said, ruling out of a 'no-deal' Brexit could provide some support for the currency,\" he added.","79":"The distribution of a \u00a350m Scottish government fund to improve struggling town centres has been revealed.The largest beneficiary will be Fife Council, which is receiving \u00a34.3m. Aberdeenshire has been allocated \u00a33.3m, with \u00a33m going to Glasgow and \u00a32.6m to Edinburgh.The smallest allocation - \u00a3660,000 - has been awarded to Inverclyde.Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said the funding would \"stimulate and support\" investment.The fund was announced as part of the 2019-20 Scottish budget deal.All 32 local authorities will receive a share of the cash, with councils deciding how to allocate the money in their areas.Mr Mackay said town centres were facing challenges adapting to a changing retail climate.He added: \"I want to make sure we can keep life in our high streets, and ensure they continue to be thriving places for communities to live, work and enjoy.\"This \u00a350m fund will enable local authorities to stimulate and support a wide range of investments which will encourage town centres to diversify and flourish, and create an increase in footfall through local improvements and partnerships.\"Local authority body Cosla has welcomed the deal.Its economy spokesman Steven Heddle said: \"Local economic development drives so much of the other vital things that councils do on behalf of our communities.\"This was a message we promoted as part of our essential services campaign ahead of this year's budget. We were clear that inclusive growth must be supported through investment in local government.He added: \"We will continue to work with the Scottish government on our shared priority of inclusive growth and growing Scotland's economy.\"The Scottish Retail Consortium, which represents retailers, said the new fund was a \"promising and timely\" move to enhance the economic viability of town centres.The organisation's director, David Lonsdale, added: \"The finance secretary is making headway on key aspects of the rates reform agenda, particularly on more regular revaluations, keeping down the headline rate, and scrapping the proposed out of town levy. \"However, this shouldn't be the limit of our ambition, with action still required to restore the level playing field with England on the large business rates supplement and with most councils yet to play their part by using their existing powers to reduce rates in their areas.\"","80":"Spain's Socialist government is widely expected to call a snap general election after failing to get its budget through parliament.Catalan separatists rejected Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez's bill after the government refused to discuss the region's right to self-determination.They voted with the conservatives, despite their different agendas.Mr S\u00e1nchez, in power since June, will announce a date for the vote after a cabinet meeting on Friday, reports say.The government's budget was rejected by 191 members out of the 350-seat parliament, with votes from the People's Party (PP) and Ciudadanos as well as Catalan separatists.Mr S\u00e1nchez leads a minority government, with just 84 seats in parliament. He is supported by a confidence-and-supply agreement and the support of a handful of smaller parties with competing interests.The PP is the largest party with 134 seats.Mr S\u00e1nchez became prime minister after his predecessor, Mariano Rajoy, from the PP was pushed out in a no-confidence vote over a corruption scandal. A new general election will be the third in five years in Spain, the eurozone's fourth-largest economy. Citing unnamed sources, Reuters news agency says 14 or 28 April are the most likely dates.Catalan pro-independence parties had insisted on a dialogue over independence for their region as the price for supporting the budget, but talks broke down last week.The government's stance remains that, according to the country's constitution, the nation is \"indissoluble\", and no part of it can secede from the whole. Divisions were highlighted on Tuesday, when 12 Catalan separatist leaders and activists went on trial for rebellion and sedition over their unrecognised independence referendum in 2017.Mr S\u00e1nchez left parliament immediately after his defeat, smiling but silent.Mr S\u00e1nchez came under political pressure for his attempts to reach out to the Catalan politicians he needed to pass his budget.On Sunday, thousands of demonstrators marched in Madrid in a pro-unity demonstration called by parties of the right, demanding fresh electionsLong hours of negotiation and parliamentary debate failed to break the deadlock.Ahead of the vote, Finance Minister Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero tried to appeal to economic sensibilities, labelling the budget's provisions for Catalonia as generous.But she also called the insistence on independence talks a form of \"blackmail\".Mr Sanchez's party still leads opinion polls but a possible result could be a right-wing majority formed by the PP, Ciudadanos and a newly-emerged far-right party, Vox.Discontent in Spain over the Catalan issue was one of the key factors behind the Socialists' defeat in regional elections in Andalusia in December to a right-wing coalition supported by Vox.","81":"Robert and Trude mourned what they thought had been a lonely and isolated life for their disabled son. But when Mats died, they discovered that people all over Europe lit candles in his memory.A version of this story was first published in Norwegian by broadcaster NRK.\"We were really very traditional. We didn't want him turning his daily rhythm upside down.\" Sitting in a cafe by his office at Oslo City Hall, Robert Steen describes how he used to worry about his son staying up late into the night.\"In retrospect, I think we should have been more interested in the game world, where he spent so much time,\" says 56-year-old Robert. \"By not doing so, we robbed ourselves of an opportunity that we didn't know we had.\"Robert delivered his funeral eulogy for Mats in late 2014, in a chapel at the Norwegian capital's Western Cemetery.Among those who sat listening to his words - in-between relatives and a few people from the health service who knew Mats well - was a group of people the family didn't know.Only Robert had met them. And only once, the evening before.Mats had barely left the basement flat underneath his family's home in the last years of his life, so it was strange that people unknown to the family were present at the funeral. Even stranger - Mats himself had also never met these people.Before his death, these grieving visitors would not have thought of Mats as Mats - but instead as Ibelin, a nobleman by birth, a philanderer and a detective. Some of those paying their respects lived close by, but others had come from afar. They wept for their good friend.Later in the funeral service one of them would speak, and tell the gathering that just now, all across Europe, people were lighting candles for Mats.It was written in the stars, it was coded in his DNA.The Mats that sauntered around with a crown on his head on his fourth birthday in July 1993 would, within a few years, not be able to walk.Robert and Trude had received the news in May 1993, in a small office in the large brick building that houses Ulleval Hospital. Mats's parents learned why their boy kept falling off the swings and hurting himself, why he didn't climb up the ladder on the slide at the nursery, even though he loved to slide down, why he supported himself on his knees like an old man when he rose from a sitting position and why he didn't race the other children.The doctors told Robert and Trude that Mats had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a rare disorder that causes muscle degeneration - mostly in boys. Mats's genes contained a coding error that would prevent his muscles from developing normally. And which would finally destroy them.\"After we put Mats to bed that evening we called the doctor. We had been given permission to do that. We could call any time, if we needed more information,\" says Robert.With Trude sitting by his side, Robert spoke on the phone for more than half-an-hour. \"I said to the doctor: 'But at least he won't die from this!' The doctor on the other end of the line was silent for a moment, 'no, but our experience is that these patients rarely live to be older than 20'.\"Robert pauses.\"He managed to make it to 25.\"At the family home in Ostensjo in south-east Oslo, Robert and Trude tried to take it all in.  Mats would not live what they considered a \"normal life\". He would die young and be taken away from them - without having set his mark on the world.They were so completely mistaken.If our DNA maps out our lives even before we are born, how can we choose who we want to be?Mats found a way and created himself anew.By the turn of the millennium, the Steen family had moved to a wheelchair-adapted home in Langhus, to the south of Oslo.While Mats was allowed to play his handheld Game Boy during breaks at school, not even Super Mario could chase away the feeling of being different. Mats sat in his wheelchair and an assistant went with him everywhere.His parents wondered what activity Mats might like to do in his spare time - when his classmates were playing football and running around outside.Online gaming perhaps? Robert gave him the password to the family PC, and a new world opened up for the 11-year-old.\"In the course of the last 10 years of his life, Mats played between 15,000 and 20,000 hours,\" Robert said in his eulogy. \"That's equivalent to more than 10 years' full-time employment.\"But the gaming also caused family friction.\"When the night nurse arrived at 22:00, Mats had to be in bed,\" says Robert. \"Their job was to monitor Mats in bed, not to put him to bed. Mats protested but reluctantly agreed.\"Mats had become a gamer. Gamers don't go to bed early.So who was Mats during all of those hours he spent playing?He became Lord Ibelin Redmoore and sometimes Jerome Walker. \"Jerome and Ibelin are extensions of myself, they represent different sides of me,\" he wrote.He immersed himself on the planet Azeroth, in the hugely popular game World of Warcraft. Azeroth is a mythical fantasy world. There are continents, seas and forests, cliffs and plains, villages and cities. Mats spent most of his time in a region called the Eastern Kingdoms.As an online player you get to know this world bit by bit, just as you know your physical world.There will be places you plan to travel to, and landscapes and cities you will master - some better than others. In some areas you will be on your guard, while in others you will love to hang out. You will find your local inn and meet new, interesting people. That's the way the world is. That's the way Azeroth is.Mats made the journey and found a wide circle of good friends.\"When I went past Mats's basement flat during the day and the curtains were closed. That is a sorrow I remember well,\" says Robert, who works as Oslo's vice-mayor of finance.\"'Oh, no,' I thought, 'he hasn't even started his day yet'. I was sad because his world was so limited.\"But non-gamers don't see the whole picture. They don't realise it's more than just shooting and point-scoring.\"We thought it was all about the game. And just that. We thought it was a competition that you were supposed to win.\"And there was the matter of Mats's circadian rhythm - his 24-hour daily cycle.\"We didn't understand why it was important for Mats to be online late in the evening and at night,\" says Robert.\"But of course, it isn't in the morning or in the middle of the day that people are playing. That is when most of them are at school or work.\"We first understood it after he passed away. Until the very end we wanted him to be asleep by 11 at night, like other 'normal' people.\"Lisette Roovers, from Breda in the Netherlands, was one of Mats's close gamer friends. She was also one of those present at the funeral in 2014.She is in Norway again - visiting friend Kai Simon Fredriksen, who also played online with Mats.\"I knew Mats for many years. It was a shock when he died, and it has shaped me,\" says Lisette, sitting on Kai Simon's sofa in Hoybraten, in north-east Oslo.Lisette, now 28, was only 15 years old when she met 16-year-old Mats. Or, to be precise, when Lisette's game character Rumour met Mats's game character Ibelin.\"We met in Goldshire,\" says Lisette.\"It's not a nice place any more, but back then Goldshire was a pleasant little village, where you could meet new, interesting characters. I was looking for someone to role play with, and among others sitting around a campfire was the one I would later learn to know as Ibelin.\"I - or Rumour, rather - acted somewhat impulsively. I jumped out of the bushes and snatched Ibelin's hat. We stood for a moment, staring back and forth, then I ran away with his hat, with no thought of direction.\"She smiles a little.Mats also wrote about this first meeting with Lisette, in a blog post he called Love.\"In this other world a girl wouldn't see a wheelchair or anything different. They would get my soul, heart and mind, conveniently placed in a handsome, strong body. Luckily, pretty much every character in this virtual world looks great.\"Lisette says: \"Mats was a good friend, sometimes a very close friend.\"We wrote [to] each other about everything, but he didn't write about his condition. I thought his life was like mine. For example, we were both agreed that we hated school.\"But there were things on which they could not agree.\"He wrote that he hated snow. I wrote that I loved it. I didn't understand then that he hated it because of his wheelchair. I didn't know about it.\"Teenage Lisette's love of gaming concerned her parents. They were worried about her school studies and her apparent lack of a social life. Their solution was to restrict her access to online play.\"Being separated from my game friends was hard for me,\" Lisette recalls.But Mats did not fail their friendship. Even if he could not find her in the game, he kept in touch with her through other channels.\"He even wrote a serious letter to my parents, in which he tried to help them understand how important playing was for me,\" she says. \"I have saved that letter.\"Robert and Trude knew their son wrote to someone named Lisette.\"Mats spoke quite a bit about these game characters - these avatars - but we didn't think much of it. He told us about Rumour, among others,\" says Robert.\"She, or Lisette rather, sent him presents, including on his birthday. We thought that was touching, and we also teased him a bit about it. Then he blushed, really blushed.\"So we thought of Lisette as a friend, because of these presents. They were tangible proof of real friendship, you could say.\"We didn't call the others he was in touch with, friends. We called them avatars. Our perception of friendship was very traditional.\"In World of Warcraft, you can either play alone or join forces with other players and form a group - or guild. Mats was part of such a group, Starlight, with about 30 members.\"Nobody just becomes a member of Starlight,\" says Robert, now educated in the ways of the World of Warcraft. \"To become a member you have to be recommended by someone who is already on the inside, then complete a trial period of one to two months.\"Starlight has existed for more than 12 years and is still an active group.\"Starlight is a special group, because it has remained united for so long. That is probably why friendships in Starlight go so deep,\" concludes Robert.Forty-year-old Kai Simon or Nomine, as he is called in the game, is the leader of Starlight.Every year since Mats's death in 2014, Starlight has held a memorial to share memories of their comrade.Last year, Kai Simon told other group members that when remembering Lord Ibelin Redmoore, they should focus on running and swimming.\"Ibelin was a runner,\" Kai Simon explains. \"It was important for him to be able to run, and it was important for him to be able to share the experience of running with others.\"Is Kai Simon now talking about Mats, or about Mats's game character? Maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe this is how it was. The person and the character became one.In the summer of 2013, Mats was 24 years old. The Steen family were on holiday in Majorca, while Mats - unable to travel - stayed at home in his basement flat with his assistant.Mats had to have someone with him at all times. Through the years he had a number of different personal assistants - including his uncle. Luckily for Mats, some of the assistants were also interested in gaming. While his parents were away in Spain, Mats started his blog \"Musings of life\". In a post titled \"My escape\", he wrote about life in Azeroth.\"There my handicap doesn't matter, my chains are broken and I can be whoever I want to be. In there I feel normal.\"Mats shared his blog with the members of the Starlight guild - one by one. This was how they got to know about their fellow player's offline situation.Lisette recalls the first time she read the blog.\"I was floored. And I got a bad conscience because I had occasionally teased him in the game and had not always been totally considerate.\"Then I thought, 'Do I have to start behaving differently towards him from now on?'. But I decided to treat him just the way I had before. He also wrote in his blog that this is what he wanted.\"In online play, she is Chit - a rough and ready character. Offline, she is Anne Hamill, a 65-year-old retired psychologist from Salisbury in the UK.Anne says she finds it fascinating how the Starlight group functions for those who often fall by the wayside in the offline world.\"Because we meet each other without preconceptions, Starlight feels safe. Even for those who see themselves as outsiders.\"Online play is a fantastic arena for meeting people and building friendships. We discover each other without stereotypes in the way. It provides the chance to find out if we like someone - and only then reveal our age, gender, disability or skin colour if we feel like it.\"I think Mats was lucky to belong to our time, technologically,\" she adds. \"In Starlight he was a key member. If he had been born 15 years earlier, he wouldn't have found a community like that.\"About six months before he died, Mats was absent from the World of Warcraft for 10 days. His fellow players wondered where he was.\"Ten days was a very long time to be logged off, because Mats was always there, when you needed someone to play or chat with,\" says Anne.When he returned to the game, the others learned that he had been admitted to hospital. Anne says she finally decided to say, in game chat, what she had been thinking. She wrote: \"Mats, you must give someone a possibility to come into contact with us, if something should happen to you. So that we can know, even if you can't give us a message yourself.\"She hoped he would either give his password to someone, or come up with his own solution of how to let Starlight know if something had happened to him.\"You are important to us,\" she wrote.\"You are just saying that because you have learned that I am sitting in a wheelchair,\" replied Mats.\"I told him that wasn't true,\" says Anne. \"I said, 'you are important to the guild. You are a fantastic listener. You are one of the people who lifts others up in Starlight'.\"It was a while before Mats posted again. \"I really understood then, that he had taken what I had said to heart.\" On 18 November 2014, Mats died.Critically ill, he had been admitted to hospital. Doctors managed to stabilise him and said he could soon be allowed home - but then the family were told to come as quickly as they could.\"He was on the fourth floor at the end of a corridor. Every second was precious, the corridor was so long,\" says Robert.They came too late. The photograph Robert took of his son on his deathbed shows a pale young man, with dark wavy hair. He has finely drawn eyes, a noble nose and a mouth marked by the breathing mask he had used for so long. He looks like he is asleep.Many years before, Lisette had made Mats a drawing. Ibelin is holding Rumour, a scarf conceals his nose and mouth.\"Mats got it through the regular mail,\" Robert says. \"Now it is hanging on the wall at home.\"The day after Mats died the whole family was at home.\"The doorbell was ringing, flowers arrived, neighbours visited. We cried,\" Robert recalls.Robert tried to think who he had to tell about Mats's death. He remembered the gamers and wondered how in the world he could reach them.\"Before Mats died, I never thought that I would have to have his password.\"But now he needed it.\"That was when I thought of his blog,\" says Robert.In fact, Mats had given his father the password to his blog, so that Robert could continuously check its statistics and monitor how many had visited and read each post.\"You don't know who plays a role in your child's life if you don't know their digital friends,\" says Anne, or Chit - as she offers some advice to parents.\"Make an agreement with your children about how to reach their digital friends in case anything should happen to them. Otherwise, they may have friends who will go around wondering forever what happened.\"At the end of the blog post about Mats's death, Robert posted an email address for anyone wanting to get in touch.\"I wrote and cried. Then I hit publish. I didn't know if any replies would come\u2026 and then the first email arrived - a heartfelt condolence from one of the players from Starlight.\"I read the email aloud: 'It is with heavy heart I write this post for a man I never met, but knew so well.' It made such an impression.\"Then came more messages of condolence - more stories of Mats's gaming life.\"He transcended his physical boundaries and enriched the lives of people all over the world,\" read one. \"Mats's passing has hit me very hard. I can't put into words how much I'll miss him,\" said the next. \"I don't believe that one single person is the heart of Starlight. But if one was, it would have been him.\" Robert says: \"An entire society, a tiny nation of people began to take shape.\"And it was on a scale that we had no idea existed. More and more emails arrived that testified about the kind of significance Mats had.\" When Mats's group, Starlight, learned of his death, the members pooled money so that those who could not afford it had the opportunity to travel to Norway for the funeral.Robert says the family was very touched.\"We cried and cried from an intense emotional joy that came from seeing what kind of a life Mats had in fact lived. With real friends, sweethearts, people who cared so much that they would fly from another country to the funeral service of someone they had never met. That was powerful.\"Lisette from the Netherlands went to the funeral. So did Anne from the UK, Janina from Finland and Rikke from Denmark.On behalf of the Starlight members, Oslo native Kai Simon addressed the congregation.\"While we are gathered here today, a candle is being lit for Mats in a classroom in the Netherlands, a candle burns in a call centre in Ireland, in a library in Sweden there is a candle lit, he is remembered in a little beauty parlour in Finland, a municipal office in Denmark, many places in England. All over Europe, Mats is remembered by many more than those who had the opportunity to come here today.\"I met Mats in a world where it doesn't matter a bit who you are, what kind of body you have, or how you look in reality, behind the keyboard.\"There, what does matter is who you choose to be and how you conduct yourself towards others. What does matter is what is found here,\" - Kai Simon laid his hand on his temple, \"and here.\" Kai Simon laid his hand on his heart. In his blog, Mats had written about the computer screen which he had sat in front of for over half his life: \"It's not a screen, it's a gateway to wherever your heart desires.\"Vicky Schaubert works for NRK in Oslo.

That said, the IMF said the economy remains vulnerable, further reforms are needed and unemployment remains unacceptably high. Greece was where the eurozone financial crisis started back in 2009, and it was the economy hardest hit. It is also the economy that has received most by way of bailout loans, some from the IMF.But most of the money came from the eurozone to total more than a quarter of a trillion euros.Those loans came with conditions. Greece had to take action to reduce the government's unsustainable borrowing needs, and to reform the economy to support growth.There were changes to labour regulation, more competition in the business world and privatisation among many other elements. Both strands encountered resistance in Greece, and the bailout terms led to political crises.But the IMF and the European Union both say the country has made progress. Growth resumed in 2013, but it was erratic at first. Last year, however, Greece managed growth of slightly more than 2% for the first time in more than decade.This year, the IMF forecasts somewhat better. Peter Dohlman, the IMF's mission chief for Greece, says that's enough to put Greece \"in the upper tier of the eurozone growth table\".It is certainly progress, indeed a striking change in performance, though the favourable comparison does partly reflect the slowdown that has hit the eurozone as a whole in the last year. It is also important to recall how much damage the Greek economy has suffered. It is still about 24% smaller than before the crisis. Unemployment has come down markedly, including for young people. But it still very high: 18.5% for the adult population as a whole and close to 40% for the young. The IMF says the reform work is incomplete and the economy remains vulnerable.A particular concern is the banks which still have high levels of loans where payments are not up to date. Mr Dohlman describes the banks as \"crippled\" by this problem. That is reflected in the fact that private sector credit continues to decline. He also says more work is needed on labour market reform so that employers can respond more easily to changing conditions.Reforms on competition also continue to lag, he says. A meeting of eurozone finance ministers this week agreed that Greece needs to do more.They discussed whether to go ahead with some debt relief measures that had already been agreed in principle but subject to the Greek government completing agreed reforms.They decided to wait until Greece had made more progress, though the European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici expressed confidence that the debt relief measures, worth almost a billion euros, could be decided by the next meeting in April at the latest. ","83":"A US federal judge has dismissed porn actress Stormy Daniels' lawsuit seeking to annul a hush money agreement she had with President Donald Trump.The agreement prevented her from discussing an alleged 2006 fling with Mr Trump - but Mr Trump had already agreed not to enforce it.Mr Trump has denied having an affair with Ms Daniels.His former lawyer Michael Cohen has said the $130,000 (\u00a3100,000) payment was made to help Mr Trump get elected.Last month Mr Cohen told Congress that Mr Trump had reimbursed him for the payment \"as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws\".Mr Trump has denied wrongdoing.The decision in favour of Mr Trump by Los Angeles Federal Judge James Otero follows the failure of Ms Daniels' defamation case against Mr Trump last year - a case over which Judge Otero also presided.She had sued the US president after he mocked her claim that a stranger had threatened her to keep quiet.Ms Daniels said the latest ruling amounted to the end of the non-disclosure agreement.\"More than a year ago when I was being threatened with a 20 million lawsuit, I asked a judge to toss out this illegal NDA. Glad I stood my ground and kept fighting,\" she said on Twitter.Her lawyer Michael Avenatti also insisted the result was a win for his client.","84":"Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen has claimed Mr Trump wanted him to lie about a property deal in Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign.During Wednesday's testimony, Cohen said Mr Trump directed covert plans for a Trump hotel, even while he denied having any business in Russia.He also said Mr Trump knew about a leak of hacked Democratic emails, and called him a \"racist\", \"conman\" and \"cheat\". Mr Trump accused Cohen of \"lying in order to reduce his prison time\".And speaking after Thursday's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, Vietnam, the US president reiterated that Cohen \"lied a lot\" during his congressional testimony.But Mr Trump said his former lawyer provided no evidence about alleged collusion between the Trump campaign with Russia during the 2016 US presidential elections.\"He didn't lie about one thing. He said, no collusion with the Russian hoax. And I said, I wonder why he didn't lie about that, too, like everything else,\" Mr Trump said.Cohen, 52, will start a three-year prison term in May for the campaign finance violation of paying hush money to one of Mr Trump's alleged mistresses, tax evasion and lying to Congress.In his public testimony to the House of Representatives Oversight Committee on Wednesday, he said Mr Trump \"knew of and directed\" plans for a Trump Tower Moscow, while stating publicly that he had no dealings in Russia.\"At the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him,\" Cohen testified, \"he would look me in the eye and tell me there's no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie.\"\"He wanted me to lie,\" the witness added.However, Cohen has been convicted of lying to Congress when he testified in 2017 that attempts to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow had stopped by January 2016.  He has since acknowledged negotiations actually continued until June 2016 in the midst of the election campaign, though the real estate project ultimately did not go ahead.Cohen apologised on Wednesday for his earlier false statements to Congress, which he claimed were \"reviewed and edited\" by Mr Trump's lawyers.Jay Sekulow, counsel to President Trump, said in a statement after the hearing: \"Today's testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the president edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false.\"Cohen also suggested federal prosecutors in New York are investigating some unspecified crime involving Trump.Cohen said he was in Mr Trump's office in July 2016 when Roger Stone, a longtime political adviser, called the then-Republican presidential candidate.The witness said Mr Stone rang Mr Trump to let him know he had been speaking to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who told him there would be a \"massive dump\" of emails within a couple of days that would politically embarrass Hillary Clinton's White House campaign.Cohen said Mr Trump responded along the lines of \"wouldn't that be great\".Mr Trump has denied having prior knowledge about Wikileaks' disclosure of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails during the election.The messages - which US authorities say were hacked by Russian intelligence - caused a damaging rift among Democrats by exposing how party officials preferred Mrs Clinton over her challenger for the presidential nomination, Bernie Sanders.Mr Stone, a self-proclaimed political dirty trickster, is currently facing charges of lying to Congress about his communications with Wikileaks and witness tampering.By Paul Wood, World Affairs Correspondent, BBC NewsAnyone who's met Michael Cohen recently will tell you that he's burning with anger at having to take the blame for crimes he says were instigated by Trump.It seems he's spent weeks being intensively prepped by his lawyers for this moment and intends to do the President fatal damage.The White House talking points - farmed out to surrogates such as Donald Trump Jr - are that he's a \"disgraced liar\" and \"convicted perjurer\".Cohen certainly knows he has - as he says in his testimony - a credibility problem.That's why he's attempting to wield a stiletto, not swing an axe, each charge backed up by what he calls \"documents that are irrefutable\" - hence the dramatic production of a cheque apparently signed by Trump (the alleged refund for paying off Stormy Daniels).He didn't talk much about whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. In fact, he said he had no direct knowledge of collusion.He did, though, say he witnessed Trump in a telephone conversation during the campaign that showed he knew in advance Wikileaks was about to publish emails hacked - by Russia - from the Democratic Party.That would be hugely significant, if true. Trump has always denied it.Cohen testified that, contrary to Mr Trump's repeated claims, he seemed to have advance knowledge of a meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan between his campaign aides and a Russian lawyer promising \"dirt\" on Mrs Clinton.The June 2016 meeting has been investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is winding up a 21-month justice department inquiry into whether the Trump campaign colluded with an alleged Kremlin plot to influence the 2016 US presidential election.Cohen spoke about an incident when Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, walked behind his father's desk and told him in a low voice: \"The meeting is all set.\" Mr Trump, Cohen told the hearing, replied: \"OK good, let me know.\"Importantly, Cohen also said under oath that he has no direct evidence that Mr Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia.\"I do not,\" he said. \"I want to be clear. But I have my suspicions.\"Cohen told lawmakers Mr Trump is a racist.He said: \"He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn't a 'shithole.' \"This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States. \"While we were once driving through a struggling neighbourhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. \"And he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid. And yet I continued to work for him.\"Cohen provided what he said was evidence of reimbursements he received from the president for hush money the lawyer has admitted paying to a porn star who says she had an affair with Mr Trump.He submitted to the committee a copy of his $130,000 (\u00a397,000) wire transfer to Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet - a payment which led to Cohen's conviction for campaign finance violations.Cohen also gave the panel a copy of a $35,000 cheque dated August 2017 - one of a series he said Mr Trump signed to pay him back in instalments.\"Lying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets,\" Cohen said. \"She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly - and she did not deserve that.\"During the hearing, the president's fellow Republicans pilloried committee Democrats for inviting a man convicted of lying to Congress.Jim Jordan of Ohio called Cohen - who lost his law licence on Tuesday - a \"fraudster\" and \"cheat\".But committee chairman Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, defended the decision to give Cohen a public platform, saying it was the panel's job to search out the truth. After the hearing, when asked whether the president committed a crime while in office, Chairman Cummings said: \"It appears that he did\".He did not offer any further detail on what crime he thought Mr Trump committed. ","85":"The Scottish economy grew by 0.3% in the final three months of 2018, according to official figures.The increase in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to a figure of 0.2% for the UK as a whole.The news comes after Scotland's unemployment rate hit a record low.Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said it was the eighth consecutive quarter of growth and that the country's economy \"continues to go from strength to strength\".The UK government's Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the 'City Deals' investment programme was aiding the growth in GDP. The full year figures for 2018 now suggest that Scotland's GDP grew by 1.4% compared to 2017, the same as the UK.Growth across the year has been driven by the services and construction sectors, which both grew by 1.7% in 2018.Services - which makes up the bulk of Scotland's economy - grew by 0.5% in the last three months of the year, while construction grew by 0.8% in the same period.However, the production sector shrank by 0.9% between October and December, with agriculture, forestry and fishing down by 1.1%.Independent economists have warned that a disorderly Brexit could have a severe impact on Scotland's GDP rates.  Mr Mackay said: \"With eight consecutive quarters of growth and record low unemployment - down to 3.4% - Scotland's economy continues to go from strength to strength.\"Growing our economy and supporting businesses and jobs is a top priority for the Scottish government. \"However, the UK's EU exit remains the biggest threat to our economic stability.\"Mr Mundell said:  \"I am encouraged by these GDP figures, which show Scotland's economy continuing to grow. \"The news follows positive employment statistics and it shows UK government support included in the Budget and the Spring Statement - and our \u00a31.35bn investment in city and growth deals - is having a big impact. \"However, I'm concerned the Scottish economy has not shown the same growth as the UK as a whole over the past few years and it is important to close the gap.\"Tracy Black, director of the business lobby group CBI Scotland, said: \"While the latest stats show eight consecutive quarters of growth, overall economic momentum remains worryingly weak. \"What we desperately need is a step-change if the Scottish economy is going to deliver on higher wages, improved living standards and increasing the potential for stronger, sustained growth in the future - an economy that's barely in first gear isn't going to cut the mustard.\"Brexit uncertainty continues to be a significant factor behind weaker growth.\"","86":"Isabella is at a crossroads. The sixth former from Suffolk has to decide between university or an apprenticeship.But her choice is not about what she most wants to do - it is being narrowed by her financial fears and in particular her worry about debt from tuition fees.\"I'd like to be able to go to university because it's what I want to do,\" she says.But instead it's a decision based on \"what I'll have to do because of money\".At the moment, despite preferring the opportunities and social experience of university, she is heading towards an apprenticeship.Isabella, part of a group of teenagers being supported by the Villiers Park social mobility charity, has a real-world, life-changing decision that will depend on the outcome of the government's review of tuition fees in England.If the fees were to be cut to \u00a35,000 or \u00a36,000, she says it would make a \"massive difference\" to the level of debt and she would switch to applying to university.Articulate and pragmatic, she sees it as a fact of economic life that the current system gives more choices to those \"who have the money\".She says she would \"definitely\" like to opt for university, and its chance to build her confidence and live independently, but her perception of the scale of debt remains too big a risk.\"I don't know where I will be in the future, I don't know if I'll be struggling with money,\" she says, and so she is looking to an apprenticeship as a practical back-up.Both of her options are in the balance.But it could all be changed by the review of student finance, headed by financier Philip Augar, which is expected to report back in the next month.What do those most likely to be affected think about fees?Villiers Park is an educational trust working with high-ability teenagers from low-income families - and these youngsters, who are thinking about whether to apply to university, see high fees and debts as a major deterrent.\"It's demoralising - maybe not for those who are higher up in society, but those who are struggling financially, they're the ones who are hit the most by this,\" says 17-year-old Vrishank.\"Fear is a big part,\" he says, with youngsters thinking student debt will be a \"burden on their shoulders throughout their whole lives... It's a stain on them\".Until former students earn \u00a325,000 they will not have to make repayments - and debts will be written off after 30 years - but such relief several decades away does not cut much ice with these teenagers.Vrishank says fees of \u00a39,250 are a \"huge amount\" and should be much lower, but he does not expect them to be scrapped.\"In an ideal world, we'd like them to free, so everyone had access to get the education they need... But we don't live in an ideal world, so we have to pay,\" he says.The current system has been defended as not deterring poorer students. More young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are going to university - although there is still a wide gap in entry levels between rich and poor families.But suggestions that there is a level playing field are stridently rejected by these teenagers.They say see their friends' decisions being strongly influenced by financial worries.\"There is a still a massive inequality, it's there from the beginning of life,\" says Isabella.It is not only about whether to apply to university, it is also about the range of options.\"I have friends who are specifically not going to London because they know the costs are too high and they won't be able to pay for them,\" says Maya, a 17-year-old from Leicester.Many people have given up on university \"because their parents can't fund them\", she says.But Maya says these families are not going to admit it is about a lack of money.\"They won't say it's about the fees, they'll say I don't want to go.\"It's not just a decision you make when you're older. 'OK, mum will I be going to university?' You kind of know as you're growing up.\"Wealthier youngsters are on a parallel educational fast track of \"more tutors, more resources, more work experience, more contacts\", says Maya.In terms of what should happen to fees, she is also not expecting them to be completely removed.\"But I do think they should be reduced as the amount that people are having to pay is ridiculous,\" she says - and suggests a fairer level would be about \u00a35,000 or \u00a36,000.Harry is at school in Belfast, but he's thinking about applying to university in England, and would be affected by any changes in fees.He says choices are being restricted by financial necessity rather than being driven by talent or ambition.\"What you personally want to do is go to the best university you can,\" but instead he says young people are limiting their horizons because of cost.Harry touches on something else that strikes a nerve with all these teenagers - a strong sense of generational unfairness.These teenagers see tuition fees as part of a bigger set of grievances, with high housing costs, economic insecurity and Brexit all added to the list.\"There is such a divide between generations,\" says Harry.\"There is a difference between people making the decisions and those who are going to have to suffer the effects,\" he says.\"We pay the consequence for our elders' decisions,\" says Vrishank.","87":"More research into computer algorithms is needed as they could have gender or race biases, the government has warned.It announced independent watchdog the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI) will investigate algorithms used in the justice and financial systems.But services using the artificial intelligence already, such as predictive policing, will continue.Human rights group Liberty said it did not make sense to acknowledge the risk and not halt current programs.\"In launching this investigation, the government has acknowledged the real risk of bias when relying on predictive policing programs powered by algorithms. So why are they already being rolled out by police forces across the country?\" asked Hannah Couchman, policy officer at Liberty.\"We should all be troubled by the silent expansion of the use of opaque algorithmic tools and the clear impact they have on our fundamental rights.\"A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which launched the inquiry, told the BBC: \"We know there is potential for bias but that is not the same as admitting that there are flaws in the system already.\"The government has not said whether algorithms currently in use are affected by bias issues.But the CDEI will work with the Cabinet Office's Race Disparity Unit to explore the potential for bias in algorithms designed for crime and justice.It will also look at potential bias in algorithms used in finance to make decisions such as whether to grant individuals loans and those used in recruitment, which can screen CVs and influence the shortlisting of candidates.Crime prediction software has already been adopted by at least 14 police forces in the UK, according to freedom of information requests by Liberty. They fall into two types - predictive mapping of crime hotspots and risk assessments of individuals to try to work out who is more likely to commit an offence or become a victim of crime.In Durham, the Harm Assessment Risk Tool is being used to assist police officers in deciding whether an individual is eligible for deferred prosecution based on the future risk of offending.And Avon and Somerset Police use a system known as Qlik, a data visualisation system that helps it decide where to put police officers.The force previously told the BBC that it made \"every effort to prevent bias\" with data not including ethnicity, gender or demographics.Luka Crnkovic-Friis, chief executive of AI start-up Peltarion and co-founder of the Swedish AI Council, told the BBC: \"Because AI is trained by people, it's inevitable that bias will filter through. \"Automation tools are only ever as good as the data fed into them, so when using historical data where there is a strong human bias - such as race, re-offending rates and crime - there certainly is a risk that the results could produce bias and the government is right to take steps to account for this.\" AI expert Dave Coplin, chief executive of consultancy The Envisioners, suggested what the CDEI should be investigating.\"We need to make sure that the CDEI is as focused on where it [artificial intelligence] is being used in government today as well as the further challenges that tomorrow's usage may bring,\" he told the BBC.","88":"Some car buyers are being overcharged by more than \u00a31,000 when they take out a loan to buy a car, the UK's financial watchdog has warned.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the industry practice of allowing dealers to set their own interest rates was costing consumers \u00a3300m a year.Dealers overcharge to boost their commission, the FCA concluded.But the Finance and Leasing Association said the watchdog's survey was \"based largely on out-of-date information\".The regulator launched its investigation into the car finance market in April 2017 after there was a rapid surge in consumer credit led by car dealership finance.At the time, it said it was concerned about a lack of transparency and potential conflicts of interest.In its final findings on motor finance, the FCA concluded that the widespread use of commission models, which allow brokers discretion to set the customer's interest rate and thus earn higher commission, can lead to conflicts of interest that are not controlled adequately by lenders.  It said the practice can lead to customers paying significantly more for their motor finance.Jonathan Davidson of the FCA said: \"We found that some motor dealers are overcharging unsuspecting customers over a thousand pounds in interest charges in order to obtain bigger commission payouts for themselves.\"We also have concerns that firms may be failing to meet their existing obligations in relation to pre-contract disclosure and explanations, and affordability assessments.  \"This is simply not good enough and we expect firms to review their operations to address our concerns.\"Four-fifths of new car finance deals are now what are known as Personal Contract Purchase, or PCP.Instead of buying a car outright, a PCP allows consumers to rent a car over a three or four-year period.At the end of the period consumers can buy the car for its residual value (known as a \"balloon\" payment), hand the car back, or roll over the residual value into a new PCP on a new vehicle.But problems have arisen because lenders have allowed brokers to set interest rates on the PCP agreements. The FCA estimated that on a typical motor finance agreement of \u00a310,000, higher broker commission can result in the customer paying around \u00a31,100 more in interest charges over a four-year term of an agreement.The FCA said it was assessing the options for intervening in the market.  Options include strengthening existing rules or other steps such as banning certain types of commission model or limiting broker discretion. In the meantime, the regulator said it would deal with individual firms where problems were identified, but it expects all lenders and brokers to review the way they do business to make sure they comply with the law and treat customers fairly.The Finance and Leasing Association (FLA), a UK trade body for asset finance, consumer finance and motor finance, said that the FCA's survey work was \"based largely on out-of-date information, and therefore does not reflect the very considerable progress the market has already made in moving away from such structures\".The FCA analysed contracts between lenders and dealers from 2013 to 2016 and examined lenders' data from January 2017 to July 2018.The FLA added: \"We look forward to working with the FCA as it modernises its regulations in line with market best practice.\"","89":"There's a growing expectation that the review of student finance in England, headed by the financier Philip Augar, is going to recommend a cut in tuition fees.The first figure floated, \u00a36,500, seems to have drifted up to \u00a37,500 after complaints from universities - but that would still be significantly less than the current maximum of \u00a39,250.With some universities already facing precarious finances - with borrowing, recruitment problems and emergency bailouts - there are claims that institutions will be at risk of collapsing.Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner says the government needs to \"get real about the consequences of a university going bust\".But how likely is it to happen?What makes universities really nervous is that a reduction in fees will not be replaced by direct funding from the government.Even if funding is promised, it will make universities dependent on the goodwill of politicians, competing with other spending pressures, such as health and schools.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute and former universities minister special adviser, says the rule of thumb is that every cut in fees of \u00a31,000 will take about a billion away from the current funding stream.If there is a significant cut in per student funding, he says, it will \"push some to the wall\".As well as a loss of fees, he says universities face a \"perfect storm\" - with a demographic dip in the number of 18-year-olds and Brexit casting a shadow over recruiting international students.There are universities already on financial thin ice - in debt over new buildings and then struggling when they fail to attract students.And if a university has a terrible year for recruitment, they have three years of teaching that reduced cohort and its smaller income.Dr Greg Walker, chief executive of the MillionPlus group of new universities, warns if funding for students is cut, or there are limits on numbers, there are risks of \"significant damage\".\"Difficult choices could well have to be made,\" he said. But he said undermining university finances would be a \"national own-goal\".Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, and an influential figure in the politics of education, says there is already a \"serious risk that some universities will go under\".He warns that the aggressive expansion of some \"juggernaut universities\" is pushing others out of business.There are a finite number of students - and if some universities take an ever-rising number, others will be left starved of fee income.Sir Anthony attacks a \"greedy cohort\" for threatening the higher education \"eco-system\".Figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency show some universities have piled on extra students, while others have shrunk.Over the past decade, Exeter University has expanded its undergraduate numbers by 74%.University College London has grown by 65%, York 48%, Bath 46% and Bristol by 41%.But London Metropolitan University has shrunk by 62%, with the University of West London down by 44%, Cumbria by 41%, the University of Central Lancashire by 34% and University of East London by 33%.If this process continues, Sir Anthony says it will threaten the future of some universities.But the University of Exeter rejects the criticism, saying it is \"proud of its growth\" and expanding has allowed more people to get places, rather than being turned away \"because of our lack of space\".Ministers and regulators have always kept to the script that they will not intervene.Last week, Universities Minister Chris Skidmore, said: \"There is an expectation that in a small number of cases providers may exit the market altogether as a result of strong competition.\" But Hepi director, Nick Hillman, says the risks of a financial crisis will not be shared evenly, and it's likely to be survival of the biggest.Only smaller institutions would be allowed to fail.Big universities are major employers, anchors of the local economy, and the legal and political fallout from closure would be too toxic, he says.Above a certain size, he says, \"the government cannot let a university fall over\". A report last week from the UPP Foundation's civic university commission showed universities' pivotal place in regional economies.In Sheffield in 1978, it says \"there were 4,000 students and nearly 45,000 people working in the steel industry\". \"Today there are around 60,000 students and around 3,000 steelworkers.\"It seems unlikely that where universities have become so central that they would be allowed to go under.Mergers or take-overs are more likely than shut downs, so that students could carry on, even though the name of the institution might have changed.Universities, as part of their registration with the Office for Students, have to produce a \"student protection plan\" showing how students could continue with their studies even if their university or course closed.Even if universities buckle financially, they would still have a long stretch before hitting the rocks.\"The capacity to cope with decline can vary,\" says higher education adviser Louis Coiffait. Some universities could trade for a long time on the value of their assets, such as land or property, with sell-offs giving them enough of a \"war chest\" to fund a recruitment drive and recovery, he says.Dr Walker says if the review could reverse the decline in part-time students that would mean a significant improvement particularly for new universities.\"The right recommendations could rocket-boost support for prospective students wishing to study flexibly,\" he says.A switch from fees to direct funding, without an overall loss of budget, could give universities a more stable income, less vulnerable to unpredictable levels of recruitment.But if fees are lowered, perhaps for autumn 2020 or later, there are are fears about a sudden drop in university cash flow, as students would be likely to postpone starting.As such the review is being urged to include a phased approach to any changes.","90":"Passengers from more than 30 countries were on board the Ethiopian Airlines flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi that crashed on Sunday, killing 157 people.Among the victims were 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians and seven Britons, according to a passenger list from the doomed flight published by Ethiopian officials.

He had a \"commendable performance\" with more than 8,000 hours in the air, the company said.A friend of Capt Yared, Hassan Katende, said his \"hair just stood up\" when he heard that he had died.In a BBC Amharic interview, Mr Katende said he learned of the crash through social media.\"I can't sleep. It's shocking. It's very hard to believe. It's really unbelievable,\" he said.Among the victims was Cedric Asiavugwa, a third-year law student at Georgetown University.He was travelling to Nairobi to attend the funeral of one of his relatives, reports say.\"With his passing, the Georgetown family has lost a stellar student, a great friend to many, and a dedicated champion for social justice across East Africa and the world,\" Georgetown Law Dean William Treanor said.Mr Asiavugwa was committed to issues of social justice, especially for refugees and other marginalised groups, the university said. He also carried out research on subjects ranging from peace to food security in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and South Sudan.Sad day for football. You were doing what you loved most.

Mr Ngare had just represented Kenya at a UN conference in Paris and was on his way to Nairobi.He was formerly an editor at local media house Standard Group and had also worked at a government agency.At the time of his death, he was working for the UN's cultural agency, Unesco, as a deputy director of communications.The Kenya National Commission for Unesco described Mr Ngare as \"one of its shining stars\".Canada has confirmed that among the identified victims was Nigerian-born Professor Pius Adesanmi, the director of Carleton University's Institute of African Studies.\"The contributions of Pius Adesanmi to Carleton are immeasurable,\" said Pauline Rankin, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. \"He worked tirelessly to build the Institute of African Studies, to share his boundless passion for African literature and to connect with and support students. He was a scholar and teacher of the highest calibre who leaves a deep imprint on Carleton.\"Benoit-Antoine Bacon, president and vice-chancellor of Global Affairs Canada, said: \"Pius Adesanmi was a towering figure in African and post-colonial scholarship and his sudden loss is a tragedy.\"Nigeria's writers, scholars and journalists reacted to the news with \"great shock and sadness\". Prof Adesanmi was travelling to Nairobi to take part in a conference organised by the African Union, reports say.Canadian-Somalian Amina Ibrahim Odowa and her five-year-old daughter, Sofia Abdulkadir, were also among the victims. Ms Odowa and her daughter had been travelling to Kenya from their home in Edmonton for her wedding, her brother told the BBC.\"Her fianc\u00e9 has not even had water since the news broke. He has not eaten anything. He is in bad shape. Our elder sister is also in shock. We are not ok. We hope to at least see her body.\" She leaves behind two other young daughters, who are being cared for by their grandmother, reports say.Environmentalist Peter DeMarsh was on his way to a conference in Nairobi when the plane crashed, his sister Helen DeMarsh said on Facebook.\"Praying for him as we remember his brilliance, devotion to humanity and the wellbeing of the planet,\" she wrote.Mr DeMarsh had moved back home to New Brunswick to be close to his elderly mother, his sister said. He leaves behind a wife and a son. Derick Lwugi, 54, an accountant and pastor from Calgary, was another victim, CBC News reported. He is described as a \"pillar\" of Calgary's Kenyan community. He leaves behind his wife, who is a domestic abuse councillor, and three children aged 17, 19 and 20.A family of six were among the Canadian victims - Kosha Vaidya, 37, and her husband Prerit Dixit, 45 were taking their 14-year-old daughter Ashka and 13-year-old daughter Anushka to Nairobi - where Kosha was born. Relatives told Canadian media that the family of Indian origin only planned the trip 10 days before. Kosha's parents, Pannagesh Vaidya, 73, and Hansini Vaidya, 67, decided to join them as it had been 35 years since the couple had been in Kenya.Danielle Moore, 24, was travelling to a UN environment conference in Nairobi.On 9 March, she posted a message on Facebook: \"I'm so excited to share that I've been selected to attend and am currently en route to the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya with United Nations Association In Canada and #CanadaServiceCorps \/ #LeadersToday! \"Over the next week I'll have the opportunity to discuss global environmental issues, share stories, and connect with other youth and leaders from all over the world.

It's just tragic that she couldn't carry on to further her career and achieve more.\"\"She was very well known in her own line of business and we've had many tributes already paid to her,\" he added.Joseph Waithaka, 55, was a dual British-Kenyan national. His son, Ben Kuria, said he was still in shock after hearing that his father, who moved to the UK in 2004, was on board the flight. Mr Kuria described him as a \"generous\" man who \"loved justice\".A father-of-three, Mr Waithaka lived in Hull and worked for the Humberside Probation Trust before returning to live in Kenya in 2015.Another victim was identified as Sarah Auffret, a University of Plymouth graduate and a polar tourism expert.Ms Auffret was on her way to Nairobi to talk about the Clean Seas project in connection with the UN Environment Assembly this week, according to her Norway-based employers Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO).\"Words cannot describe the sorrow and despair we feel. We have lost a true friend and beloved colleague,\" the AECO said in a statement.Ms Auffret also held French citizenship, Norwegian media reported.Anne-Katrin Feigl was a German national who worked for the UN migration agency, the IOM. Ms Feigl was en route to a training course in Nairobi, the IOM said in a statement.Catherine Northing, chief of the IOM mission in Sudan where Ms Feigl worked, called her \"an extremely valued colleague and popular staff member, committed and professional\", saying \"her tragic passing has left a big hole and we will all miss her greatly\".  The IOM said it would fly its flag at half-mast tomorrow, along with other UN agencies, as a mark of respect.Hospitality company Tamarind Group announced \"with immense shock and grief\" that its chief executive Jonathan Seex was among those killed. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and the Tamarind community and all the others who have suffered unfathomable losses,\" the company said in a statement.Tamarind Group is one of Africa's leading restaurant and hospitality firms.

In 2017, debit card use overtook the number of payments made in cash in the UK for the first time.The growth in contactless in 2018 is expected to lead to to a widening of this gap.Some 6.3 billion payments were made using contactless debit cards last year, a 29% increase on the previous year, the UK Finance data shows. These purchases were worth a collective total of \u00a358bn.The increase in the use of contactless on credit cards was even greater - with 44% more purchases of this kind in 2018 compared with the previous year.More consumers have been sent replacement credit cards with a contactless facility, but they are still used far less than debit cards. There were 1.1 billion credit card payments on contactless last year, valued at nearly \u00a311bn.The average amount spent in a transaction of any kind on a debit or credit card last year was \u00a335.Eric Leenders, managing director of personal finance at UK Finance, said: \"Many of us are now reaching for our cards or mobiles rather than cash to make low-value purchases, as customers opt for the convenience and security of paying with contactless. \"There has also been an increase in credit card use although growth in outstanding balances has slowed, suggesting many consumers are using their cards for day-to-day spending rather than as a means of borrowing.\"A major report, published earlier this month, found that cash was at risk of disappearing without action from regulators and the government.The system which underpins the use of notes and coins was at risk of falling apart, the Access to Cash Review concluded.","92":"It's Monday, a new week, so let's get a sense of what's coming up with some of the most important and interesting stories over the next seven days.What's happening?On Tuesday, Malaysia's former prime minister, Najib Razak, goes on trial over corruption involving the state's 1MDB fund. He faces charges including criminal breach of trust, which he denies.Why does it matter?The disappearance of billions of dollars from Malaysia's state fund was one of the biggest financial scandals in history, the full implications of which are still being understood.According to US and Malaysian prosecutors, the money, which was meant to help the people of Malaysia, instead lined the pockets of a few powerful individuals.This is the first time for anyone to face trial over the scandal - and it's no less a figure than the man who was still governing Malaysia last May.What's happening?On Saturday, Nigerians will vote in the country's first presidential election since 2015.Why does it matter?Whoever wins will govern over Africa's most populous country.There are more than 60 candidates running, but two who are realistically in with a chance of winning, both of whom are men in their 70s.On one side is the current president, Muhammadu Buhari, who has often been absent due to illness and under whom unemployment has doubled. He can claim improved security in the north-east and his incorruptibility as plus points.On the other side is Atiku Abubakar, a prominent businessman and philanthropist who has tried for the presidency three times before - and failed each time.What's happening?Donald Trump's jail-bound former lawyer testifies before the US Senate on Tuesday.Why does it matter?This will be the first time Michael Cohen has given a detailed run-through of his relationship with the US president, in his own words.On 6 March, Cohen will start a 36-month sentence given after he admitted campaign finance violations, tax evasion and lying to Congress.Relations between the president and his former loyal lawyer have soured significantly, and Cohen condemned what he called his former boss' \"dirty deeds\" in December. He's now co-operating with investigators.He'll now give evidence before the Senate Intelligence Committee, and the top Democrat on the panel says there are key questions he needs to answer, notably on any possible contact between the Trump campaign and Russia.Before you get the popcorn ready, though: you should know the hearing will be in private.","93":"Lancaster University is opening a campus in Germany in an attempt to protect itself from the \"possible impact of Brexit\".The university will offer degrees, taught in English, for up to 2,000 students in Leipzig.Deputy interim vice-chancellor, Prof Steve Bradley, said international staff unsure of their status after Brexit were \"reassured\" by the move.The university teaches students from 100 different countries. Prof Bradley said: \"It will provide an opportunity to students in the EU and beyond who want a UK degree from a good university and who would have otherwise come to the UK.\" He said the campus would give them a \"foothold\" in Europe but also help the university recruit students from India and China.The number of international students in the UK has been dropping partly due to the fact the UK no longer allows them to continue working in the country, following their graduation.But Germany allows students to work for two years after their studies. The Leipzig campus will teach degrees in business and management, accounting and finance, software engineering, and computing.Lancaster is working with education provider, Navitas, to establish the campus but it will retain responsibility over all academic matters.The university's vice-chancellor, Prof Mark E. Smith, added: \"This will create Lancaster's first campus in mainland Europe - an exciting prospect and one which I hope will bring new opportunities to ambitious students.\"The campus adds to Lancaster's existing overseas campus operations in Malaysia, China and Ghana and research partners in 60 countries.The initial agreement is for 10 years with the first student intake expected in September for a foundation programme. In October, Imperial College London signed a post-Brexit arrangement with the Technical University of Munich in which staff will be appointed jointly by both institutions, with the aim of keeping access to EU research funding for UK academics.","94":"A former Canadian justice minister says she faced attempts at interference and \"veiled threats\" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for a firm facing a corruption trial. Jody Wilson-Raybould said she was pressed repeatedly to \"find a solution\" for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. PM Justin Trudeau said he disagreed with the minister's testimony and he and his staff acted appropriately.Opposition leader Andrew Scheer has called on him to resign.\"He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,\" the Conservative leader told reporters, adding that he was calling for a full police investigation.Speaking to the House of Commons justice committee, the former justice minister and attorney general said she and her staff faced four months of a \"sustained\" and \"inappropriate effort\" to push for a possible deferred prosecution agreement for the Quebec-based engineering and construction company. That agreement would have allowed the firm to avoid a criminal trial and instead agree to alternative terms or conditions, like penalties or enhanced compliance measures. It was an option rejected in September by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada - an independent authority whose main objective is to prosecute federal offences - and one she supported. Ms Wilson-Raybould said she and her aides were pulled into multiple conversations and meetings - \"a barrage of people hounding me and my staff\" - with Mr Trudeau, senior aides from his office and the finance department, and a top bureaucrat.In those various meetings, they repeatedly raised concerns about the possibility of job losses and potential political ramifications of a trial long after that decision had been made. \"Within these conversations, there were expressed statements regarding the necessity of interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential of consequences and veiled threats if a deferred prosecution agreement was not made available to SNC,\" she said.Mr Trudeau's Liberals have struggled to contain the controversy over the past three weeks. Though she has been a key figure at the centre of the affair, Ms Wilson-Raybould had not yet not spoken publicly, citing solicitor-client privilege. That privilege was waived by the government on Monday, paving the way for her appearance before the committee on Wednesday. This began in early February, when the Globe and Mail newspaper reported on allegations of political interference in the case against SNC-Lavalin.The newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources, that Mr Trudeau's office pressured Ms Wilson-Raybould to push the public prosecution service to consider a deferred prosecution agreement. Ms Wilson-Raybould was attorney general and justice minister until January, when she was shuffled into the veterans affairs portfolio, a move widely seen as a demotion. An attorney general is supposed to act independently with respect of his or her prosecutorial function. On 12 February, Ms Wilson-Raybould resigned suddenly from Cabinet, though she remains a Liberal member of Parliament. Finally on 18 February, Mr Trudeau's top aide Gerald Butts announced he was resigning, denying in a statement that he or anyone on his staff did anything wrong but saying he had to leave so as not to be a distraction from the \"vital work\" being done by the team. Mr Trudeau and his officials have denied anything improper took place but have struggled to contain the crisis.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday evening, he said he was worried about jobs at SNC Lavalin and how pensioners would be affected.Opinion polls indicate the matter is beginning to hurt the Liberals with months to go until the coming general election. The Quebec-based firm is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies. The company and two of its subsidiaries face fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m ($36m; \u00a328m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011.The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.The agreement - similar to regimes in the US and the UK - essentially suspends prosecution while allowing a firm to agree instead to alternative terms or conditions. SNC-Lavalin and its supporters say it would be unfair to penalise the company as a whole and its thousands of employees for the wrongdoings of former executives. Preliminary hearings for the charges are currently before the courts. The company says it will \"vigorously defend itself\" against the allegations. A conviction could result in a decade-long ban on bidding on Canadian federal contracts, which would be a major financial hit for the firm. ","95":"The Scottish government's budget is facing defeat after the Scottish Greens said they would vote against the plans unless changes were made.MSPs will hold their first vote on the budget on Thursday, with the minority SNP government in need of backing.The Conservatives and Lib Dems have dismissed doing a deal unless ministers rule out a new vote on independence.And the Greens have stated that they cannot back the budget as it stands unless more money is given to councils.Party co-convener Patrick Harvie said the current proposals would be \"hugely damaging\" for local government, but Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said councils would be worse off if the budget bill was not passed.Mr Mackay unveiled his plans in December 2018, with extra funding for education, the health service and infrastructure coming alongside a widening of the tax gap for higher earners north and south of the border.However, the minority SNP administration needs opposition MSPs to either back its proposals or abstain when the stage one vote on the budget bill takes place on Thursday.With Labour seeking widespread changes and the Conservatives and the Lib Dems refusing to enter talks unless the government rules out a second referendum on independence, negotiations with the Greens have been at the fore.Mr Harvie said the government \"seem determined to force through a hugely damaging budget\" which would \"decimate local services around the country\".He said: \"A crisis in local services can be avoided, but it will require a fundamental change of position from the Scottish government.\"SNP ministers do have options for finding the funds needed to protect council budgets, and as we always do the Greens have offered constructive and realistic proposals at every stage. \"The ball is now back in the government's court. If the government continues to refuse to accept our proposals or even come up with fair alternatives, we cannot vote for this budget when it comes to Parliament on Thursday.\"Mr Harvie did not stipulate whether Green members would vote against the budget or abstain, but MSP Andy Wightman underlined that the party \"will be voting against the budget this week\" unless changes are made.Mr Mackay insists that the \u00a311.1bn settlement for local government represents a real-terms increase in both revenue and capital funding, and a real-terms increase in total overall support.The finance secretary said his \"door remains open\" to opposition parties to secure a deal.He said: \"It is essential we do all we can to protect our economy amid the ongoing Brexit uncertainty. The Scottish budget we propose offers that stability and provides as much certainty as possible in the circumstances.\"Our spending plans for 2019-20 provide a real terms funding increase for Scotland's essential public services, including additional funding of almost \u00a3730m for our health and care services and more than \u00a3180m to raise attainment in our schools.\"The budget also gives a vital boost to our economy through our \u00a35bn infrastructure investment programme.\"If the budget bill gets through the stage one vote, it will go to the finance committee for amendments to be considered before a final vote of all MSPs in mid-February.By Philip Sim, BBC Scotland newsThe SNP has 62 MSPs at Holyrood, and needs 65 votes for a majority in the chamber.The opposition are technically one vote down while Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson is on maternity leave, but the SNP has been maintaining an informal pairing operation during her absence, so it should not affect the balance.So if the SNP maintain the support of independent member Mark McDonald, this means they need two opposition members to back them in order to command a majority.Two Lib Dems did back the budget in 2018 in return for extra funding for ferries to their northern isles constituencies, but this is not understood to be a likely outcome this year.So with the Conservatives, Labour and Lib Dems all determined to vote against, the Greens appear to be Mr Mackay's first and last hope of a deal.If he can't persuade them to vote with him, the next best thing would be to persuade them not to vote at all. Two MSPs abstaining would see the result tied, while three dropping out would leave the government with a majority.If the vote ends in a tie at stage one, the presiding officer's casting vote - which traditionally goes \"in favour of the status quo\" - would let the bill proceed, to allow talks to continue. But if there's a tie in the final vote, the \"status quo\" would be the existing budget arrangements - so Ken Macintosh would vote the new budget down.MSPs are obliged to pass a budget bill each year. However, there is no rule that they have to do it at the first time of asking.The Scottish Parliament's standing orders state that \"if a budget bill falls or is rejected at any stage by the parliament, a budget bill in the same or similar terms may be introduced at any time thereafter\".This happened in 2009, when the final vote was tied 64 to 64 despite the Conservatives backing the SNP. The presiding officer's casting vote saw the motion rejected.Ministers brought back a fresh set of proposals the following week, which passed under emergency procedures with only the Greens opposing them.If the parliament is completely deadlocked, it is possible that an election would have to be called to break it.This would require either a two-thirds majority of MSPs backing such a move, or the government resigning or being forced from power in a confidence vote and no replacement being agreed.When the SNP first entered government in 2007, Alex Salmond's minority administration was regularly helped through budget votes by the Conservatives.The need for budget partners disappeared after the party won a majority in the 2011 elections, ending the pact with the Tories - who have not backed an SNP budget since.The SNP was returned to minority government after the 2016 election, and has managed to win the backing of the Greens for the two budgets since then.But in total the Greens have only supported four SNP budgets out of 12, while Labour has backed just two.","96":"Two set pieces for the Scottish budget are the mainstay of the week, as MSPs return to Holyrood after recess.On Tuesday afternoon MSPs will vote on the Scottish rate resolution.This sets the level of income tax for the 2019-20 financial year.Then the Budget Bill will be debated on Thursday afternoon, ending with the crucial vote at 5pm.While discussion on income tax has been fairly muted so far this year - largely because Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has opted not to change rates - Tuesday is likely to see disagreement about the growing tax gap between Scotland and the rest of the UK.Thursday could see clashes around the possibility of the workplace parking levy.Critics have warned this will be passed on to workers, thus increasing the amount in tax they end up paying.But the Greens - the main proponents of the levy - insist the move simply opens up the options for councils to generate extra revenue.Alongside this, expect discussion on council settlements.What else is happening at the Scottish Parliament this week?Before the rate resolution debate, Brexit Secretary Mike Russell is currently scheduled to respond to the latest events at Westminster.It follows Prime Minister Theresa May suffering another Commons defeat last week  after MPs voted down her approach to Brexit talks.The member's debate will focus on an under-threat rail maintenance company which would result in 180 job losses. This is being led by Labour MSP James Kelly.In the morning, Holyrood Live will be covering the health committee as it considers personal care, national assistance, and the integration of health and social care.Health Secretary Jeane Freeman will be attending, as well as representatives from Cosla, the local authority umbrella body.Over lunchtime on Wednesday, the first meeting of the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints will take place.Members will elect a convener, deputy convener, and consider the timing and approach to the inquiry.However, it is likely they will announce a delay until after the criminal case against the former first minster has been concluded.The Fuel Poverty (Target, Definition and Strategy) (Scotland) Bill will be debated for the first time on Wednesday afternoon.The legislation will put in place a long-term target of having fewer than 5% of households in Scotland in fuel poverty by 2040.But the local government committee has called for an additional target to be introduced to focus on those living in extreme fuel poverty.Prior to this, health and sport ministers face portfolio questions and MSPs consider the Hutchesons' Hospital Transfer and Dissolution (Scotland) Bill.Earlier in the day, the rural economy committee will be continuing its evidence gathering on the Restricted Roads (20 mph Speed Limit) (Scotland) Bill.Green MSP Mark Ruskell is proposing to lower the speed limit in built-up areas of Scotland to 20mph.Supporters of the bill argue it will reduce casualty rates and increase the number of people choosing to walk and cycle.But those who oppose it insist it will be confusing for drivers plus too time-consuming and costly to maintain.Elsewhere, Education Secretary John Swinney will be discussing standard assessments with the education committee. Mr Swinney previously ordered a review into the tests at P1, but the committee's inquiry is considering their use at all ages.Prior to the Budget Bill debate, Holyrood Live will bring coverage of First Minister's Questions from noon.After that, Tory MSP Jamie Green leads a member's debate on sustainable transport - specifically focusing on low emission vehicles and new rail technology.","97":"A multi-million pound bypass that has been 70 years in the planning officially opened in Powys on Thursday.One haulier said Newtown bypass will make a \"big difference\" due to 45-minute hold-ups in the town, while the local AM said it was a \"momentous\" day.The Welsh Government said the road will ease congestion by about 40% in the town centre.A public notice printed in 1949 shows a bypass was being considered by the former Montgomeryshire County Council.The four-mile (6.4km) road runs to the south of the town with two lanes in one direction and one in the opposite direction, to provide overtaking points.For many in the area, it is hugely important.Colin Owen, who runs RA Owen and Sons coal and agricultural merchants in nearby Llandinam, said Newtown has been referred to as the \"car park of mid Wales\" due to the length of traffic delays.\"People were afraid to go into town because they didn't want to go out of the traffic queue, because they'd only have to rejoin it again,\" he said.\"It is going to make a very big difference, and it will ease the movement of traffic and save us a lot of time coming through Newtown.\"Life-long resident Joy Hamer, 86, who lived on the main road for many years, said traffic issues had long been a big part of local life.\"It will be a big thing for the town,\" she added.Newtown mayor Sue Newham said: \"A new chapter has begun for our town and we intend to make the most of every opportunity.\"And town council clerk Ed Humphreys said: \"Change is the lifeblood of opportunity for Newtown.\"The bypass is opening less than three years after work started on the \u00a395m project. But it has been a long road.A council public notice published in August 1949 sought \"school boys 16 years of age or over\" to work as enumerators to count vehicles for a traffic survey.There were also discussions about a bypass in the 1960s and the 1980s but the green light never came, as many had mixed reaction to the idea.In recent years, congestion around the town worsened, a situation that was blamed largely on traffic lights replacing a roundabout.And people vented frustrations, including claims that the traffic was driving shoppers away.Increasing congestion led to a change in public opinion, according to Montgomeryshire Conservative AM Russell George.The Welsh Government said the industrial development of Newtown had been \"hampered by congestion issues\".Then, in 2008, it confirmed it would finance the project, and work was set to start in 2011.But it was put on hold after a spending review in 2010.In 2011 a 10,000-name petition was presented to ministers by Mr George calling for work to start.And construction began in March 2016, albeit after a further hold-up, although contractors have delivered the project ahead of time.AM Mr George said the bypass opening was a \"momentous occasion\".Nick Cleary, project manager for contractors Alun Griffiths, said the scale of the project had been a challenge, building four underpasses, three bridges and importing 350,000 tonnes of stone.\"This is one of the largest road projects for mid Wales,\" he said.The launch was conducted by transport and economy minister Ken Skates who said it would \"lead to shorter journey times and improved air quality in the area\".","98":"When bosses at the top four audit firms were asked by Parliament last week whether they were happy with the quality of the audits they were performing, only one could bring himself to say yes.And his firm, PwC, was fined a record amount last year for how badly it reviewed now-defunct department store BHS's books.It's a stark assessment of one of the least glamorous but most important roles in finance.If you are a UK company with more than \u00a310.2m of sales or \u00a35.1m of assets, you usually have to have an auditor. If you don't, the government can force one upon you.There are about 5,600 smaller registered auditors in the UK, but auditing of large businesses is dominated by the so-called big four firms: Deloitte, EY, PwC and KPMG.And these big four have come in for criticism over their failure to spot warning signs at collapsed businesses such as construction firm Carillion (audited by KPMG) and BHS (PwC).This has resulted in the Competition and Markets Authority proposing a major shake-up of the industry, as well as the big four bosses' appearance in front of MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee.An audit is effectively a test of a company's accounts on a sample basis, says Simon Mott-Cowan, head of audit at H W Fisher & Company, a smaller auditing firm.For a smaller business, a few auditors will spend a few weeks on site at the client firm, plus a few weeks of planning, reviewing and writing up their final assessment. Exact timings depend on how complicated the business is.Auditors can demand access to anything and everything they need, which may involve an entire backup of a company's accounting system, says Mr Mott-Cowan. These numbers are tested by sampling transactions. How much you sample depends on how complicated the business is, he says, and judgement must be used.Since accounts cover a year, and some things companies do last more than a year - like building projects, or being sued - sometimes estimates must be made. This is another area for judgement and one where an auditor and a company boss may clash.An audit goes through several stages, from planning, to gathering the necessary information, testing and then a number of layers of review. The best information can often come from outside the firm, says Mr Mott-Cowan. A bank letter tells you \"interesting things\" including all loan and deposit balances, but you have to know which bank to go to, he says.Another big area, and the thing most investors will at least glance at in their report, is whether the auditor sees any reason why the company wouldn't survive the next year.\"When I sign off that audit report as part of the process, I'm actually signing off to say that I think there is no issue with that entity continuing to trade for the next 12 months,\" says Mr Mott-Cowan. \"If I'm not confident of that we would mention it in the audit report.\" These concerns are more and more common. Partly that's down to the economy, he says, but also because regulators have become more interested in this area. \"Over the years there's been more emphasis on [whether a business is a] going concern.\"So where has it all gone wrong?Last year, PwC was fined a record \u00a36.5m for its failed audit of BHS. It signed off on the health of the retailer days before it was sold for \u00a31. In 2017, it was fined \u00a35.1m for its poor audit of fellow auditor RSM Tenon and \u00a35m for its audit of collapsed property services group Connaught. KPMG, EY and Deloitte bosses all agreed they were unhappy with their firms' performances when asked in Parliament last week, while Kevin Ellis, chairman of PwC UK, would only say \"we can always improve\". A bone that two MPs on the select committee were keen to pick was with the auditors' alleged failure to follow rules on rubberstamping dividends. Money paid out of a company must be very carefully accounted for and auditors must say if firms have been following the law.Firms including Domino's Pizza and Carillion were among those that had admitted to or were found to have paid dividends when they shouldn't have, said Labour MP Peter Kyle.\"When we look at the example of Domino's Pizza, \u00a385m of unlawful payments were made in a 16-year period,\" he said. \"Did you just forget the capital payments rules or did you ignore them?\" he asked EY UK chairman Steve Varley. \"It can only be one of the two.\"\"We are and have been\" complying with the law, Mr Varley said, but added: \"We are not lawyers.\" He declined to talk further about Domino's, saying it wouldn't be appropriate.Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach went further: \"Where's the challenge to the audit committee to check that the company has been complying with the law? And if you are not exposing that, then you are complicit in fraud, aren't you? On the shareholders?\" The accounting chiefs who spoke up in the hearing insisted they were compliant with the law.What disappoints Tim Bush, head of governance at the shareholder lobby group Pirc, is the sweeping power auditors have and don't appear to be exercising. According to the law, an auditor can request any information needed from any employee. If information given is knowingly or recklessly false or deceptive in something important, that can land you in prison for up to two years and with a fine.But with so many substandard audits, why has nobody been jailed? \"The reason they don't invoke this power is it's confrontational,\" says Mr Bush.In practice, if things are this bad, a relationship will already have broken down far beyond repair, says Mr Mott-Cowan.Although that's not to say other things won't go wrong.\"You've seen what happened recently where people have said the auditor is at fault for various things. You have to make sure you have the backup of your audit files to substantiate the opinion you have arrived at.\"You have a duty if you spot something to take it forward, absolutely. But you aren't going to find everything.\"The BEIS Committee will hold further hearings this week on the future of audit.","99":"US President Donald Trump has named senior Treasury Department official David Malpass to lead the World Bank.If approved, he is expected to push the bank to narrow the focus of its lending to the world's poorest countries, among other changes.His nomination has stirred debate, as some worry that Mr Malpass, a critic of the bank, will seek to reduce its role.White House officials said Mr Malpass, a long-time Republican, would be a \"pro-growth reformer\".At a press conference in Washington, Mr Trump praised Mr Malpass as a \"strong advocate for accountability at the World Bank for a long time\".The president, who frequently criticises multilateral institutions, said he expected Mr Malpass to ensure that the bank's dollars \"are spent effectively and wisely, serve American interests and defend American values.\"Mr Malpass, a Trump loyalist, was a senior economic adviser to the US president during his 2016 election campaign. He has served as the Treasury Department's undersecretary for international affairs since August 2017.The 62-year-old has criticised the World Bank, along with other institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, for being \"intrusive\" and \"entrenched\".He has also pushed the bank to reduce its lending to China, which he says is too wealthy to deserve such aid, and deploys harsh practices when lending to other countries.The US, the World Bank's largest shareholder and a major source of its funding, has traditionally held sway over the selection process for president. An American has led the institution since its start in the 1940s, when it was created to help rebuild Europe in the aftermath of World War II.However, there has been increased pressure to diversify the bank's leadership, reflecting the economic rise of other countries in recent decades.It is not clear if other countries will propose alternatives to challenge Mr Malpass for the presidency.The World Bank, which has 189 members, is accepting names until 14 March and plans to create a shortlist of up to three candidates for interviews.Its executive board expects to vote on candidates before its April meeting.The US controls 16% of the 25-member board's voting power. European shareholders, who control another significant chunk of voting power, are also unlikely to block the pick, according to Reuters.White House officials said Mr Malpass would champion \"pro-growth\" policies, emphasising the role of the private sector, increased lending transparency and more \"competitive\" tax systems.He will also oversee implementation of reforms the US pushed last year, which coupled an increase in money for the bank with changes aimed at reducing lending to China.Officials said Mr Malpass's nomination did not signal a lack of support for the organisation, which helps finance development projects with loans, credits and grants, committing more than $60bn (\u00a346.3bn) in its most recent financial year,  However, they said the administration did want to see changes to make it more effective.\"Sometimes that does require real reform and modernising ways of doing business,\" a senior administration official said during a background briefing with reporters.If approved, Mr Malpass would replace Jim Yong Kim, a doctor and former president of Dartmouth University, who unexpectedly resigned last month.Mr Kim, whose tenure had been rocky, is joining a private equity fund. ","100":"Over the years, one financial crisis after another has ruined - or profited - those caught in the middle of it. The pay and benefits of UK residents is still being affected by the latest crisis of a decade ago.So when has financial advice eased, exacerbated, or even created these downturns? Researchers at the universities of Southampton, Edinburgh, Lancaster and Manchester - funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council - have explored the history of financial advice, and how it is represented in culture. The findings are part of a free, online course.Professor Nicky Marsh, principal investigator on the project, has picked out some examples from art and literature and explains what they tell us. The failure of the South Sea Company was the crisis that shaped our understanding of the dangers of speculative bubbles. Yet many of its satirical representations focus on the deceptions of those involved and speak of a deep mistrust toward the emerging financial profession. The cartoon The Bubblers bubbl'd or the Devil Take the Hindmost, for example, depicts stockjobbers passing stock certificates that flutter down from above in a crazed dance from which they cannot free themselves, and in which the only option is to try to pass the worthless paper to the greater fool beside them. Investors in the 1720s relied on stockjobbers, rumours and friends and relatives for their financial advice. Even when the genre of financial advice had appeared, in newspaper columns and guidebooks, it was not always trustworthy. The financial boom of the 1820s provided investors with a dizzying range of new investments, especially those with an appetite for imperial adventures. The financial advice manuals that now did exist conservatively warned against these investments so new writers filled the gap.A speculative genre of financial advice emerged, one that talked up the untold wealth to be made from new discoveries, innovations, and technologies. One of the most notorious examples was Thomas Strangeways' 1822 Sketch of the Mosquito Shore. The book was authored by the soldier and adventurer Gregor MacGregor but its glowing account of the resources and climate of the new nation of Poyais was entirely fraudulent. It was targeted chiefly at the settlers he hoped to lure to his utopia, but the book underpinned MacGregor's efforts to float a Poyais loan on the London market and he raised over \u00a350,000 before the scam was exposed.Britain went mad for railway shares in the 1840s. In their Haworth parsonage, the Bronte sisters - Charlotte, Emily, and Anne - inherited shares in the York and North Midland Railway. Charlotte's letters reveal how the sisters navigated the market. Emily took charge of their investments, \"carefully reading every paragraph and every advertisement in the newspapers that related to rail-roads\". But the press, full of hype for the railways, did not give the best advice. Charlotte wanted to sell out before it was too late, but could not persuade \"headstrong\" Emily, and eventually gave way. Her concerns were vindicated when the market collapsed. Charlotte learnt from the mistake. She took the advice of her publisher in 1849 and invested the royalties from her novel Shirley in Consols (perpetual government bonds).Thomas Lawson (1857-1925) was at one point the sixth richest man in America. He made his fortune as a stock promoter, organising large corporate mergers. However, he was soon sick of what he saw as the corrupt stranglehold that a clique of big businessmen had on the American economy. Instead he turned to muckraking journalism, and in 1906 published Frenzied Finance. It was a searing expos\u00e9 of the scandal surrounding the Amalgamated Copper deal.He soon realised that journalism does not pay as well as finance, so he returned to stock promotion. This time he tried to move the market not by insider dealing or an advice manual, but by writing a sensationalist novel, Friday the Thirteenth (1907). It predicted an apocalyptic crash of the stock market. His avid readers took his warnings at face value, and ended up creating the real world the financial panic that the fiction had imagined - and Lawson pocketed the profit.At the opening of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925), the narrator, Nick Carraway, recalls buying \"a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities\".In the 1920s, many Americans likewise devoured guides to Wall Street speculation in the hope of following in the footsteps of the legendary financier J.P. Morgan, and came to regret it when prices on the New York Stock Exchange collapsed in the Great Crash of 1929 and they lost anything they had invested. Fitzgerald would go on to write the definitive post-crash story, Babylon Revisited, in 1931. The \"luck in the market\" enjoyed by the protagonist in the 1920s boom allows him to live as \"a sort of royalty, almost infallible, with a sort of magic around [him]\", until the market cleans him out. Fitzgerald's protagonist ultimately suffers a breakdown - a fate sadly shared by the author himself and his wife Zelda in the depression years that followed what the author called \"the most expensive orgy in history\".As inflation steadily rose throughout the 1970s, financial advice often took a decidedly apocalyptic turn. Howard Ruff's How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years recommended buying gold, food and guns. The relationship between financial advice and disaster fiction also began to blur in this moment. Paul Erdman's The Billion Dollar Sure Thing, which turned President Nixon's recent closing of the gold window into a cold war thriller, was taken up by influential economists for offering the best explanation of how money worked in the new economy emerging from the 1970s. The stock price chart - with its upward and downward lines forming peaks and troughs that resemble the profile of a mountain range - is one of the most familiar ways of visualising the financial markets. Many investment advice authors believe that the movements of prices reflect underlying natural laws and form recurring patterns that can be \"charted\" and exploited for profit. In their digital work Black Narcissus (2014), the British artists Matthew Cornford and David Cross track along a computer-generated mountain skyline mapped onto the historical undulations of the stock market in the period 2003-2013. In this still from the work, the downward trend on the left, culminating in the vertiginous drop in the centre, corresponds to the global financial crisis of 2008. Here, the market quite literally falls off a cliff edge - one that very few people saw coming.","101":"Just 91,000 families made use of the new Tax-Free Childcare system in December, according to new government data, That is far below the expected number. Official figures, analysed by the BBC, show the government had planned and budgeted for 415,000 families to be using the system by October 2017. By December 2018, just 22% of that number had signed up.The government urged families to see if they qualified.The shortfall is partly because the full rollout was pushed back following technical glitches with its website, but almost a year after the full rollout, take-up is still far lower than anticipated. And while the government had initially expected 324,000 more families to sign up, far more are potentially missing out. In total, an estimated 1.3 million could qualify for the help, meaning only about one in 14 eligible families has done so. That's costing people money - the Office for Budget Responsibility had forecast spending \u00a3800m on Tax-Free Childcare in 2017-18, but that was revised down to \u00a337m specifically because of low take-up. In 2018, the Family and Childcare Trust's annual survey showed that the cost of a part-time nursery place for a child under two was \u00a3122 per week, a rise of 7% in a year.Families who use Tax-Free Childcare receive \u00a32 from the state for every \u00a38 they pay in, up to a value of \u00a32,000 per child per year.The new scheme replaces Childcare Vouchers, which is now closed to new applicants. The government says Tax-Free Childcare is better than the old system as it is open to both employed and self-employed people, meaning about a million more families qualify for help.It is also paid per child rather than per parent, allowing lone-parent households to get the same amount of support.However, the scheme has suffered from technical glitches - including last year when 22,000 payments were not passed onto childcare providers - and the help available has been criticised for adding to parent confusion.Julia Waltham, head of policy at the campaign organisation Working Families, says more should be done to help parents identify the best way to get help with their childcare costs. \"The reason for the low take-up of Tax-Free Childcare could be because parents have chosen to stick with employer-supported childcare vouchers; and we know from our own research that working parents are increasingly reliant on informal childcare support from family, often grandparents,\" she said.\"But the fact remains that there are seven types of childcare support - each with different eligibility criteria and different ways of interacting with each other - available to parents and carers.  \"This tangled web of support can be complicated, and difficult for parents and carers to navigate.Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says not enough is being done to inform parents of their options: \"When the market is getting behind something, they put money into communications and things happen. \"Tax-Free Childcare, however, is in the hands of the government, and so far there's every sign they're not throwing themselves behind efforts to let parents know about the free money on offer.\"A government spokesperson said: \"Tax-Free Childcare is a great offer for working parents and more and more families are benefitting from it. We're urging all parents to check the Childcare Choices website to see how much they could save, and to apply.\"They added that the number of parents benefitting from Tax-Free Childcare had almost doubled since March last year and they were running a national campaign to raise awareness.","102":"Mike Ashley's Sports Direct has made a bid for cafe chain Patisserie Valerie, which collapsed into administration last month.A Sports Direct statement late on Friday confirmed an offer had been made, but gave no further details.Administrator KPMG closed 70 Patisserie Valerie outlets, but kept 121 open in the hope of finding a buyer.Mr Ashley, who owns House of Fraser and has a big stake in Debenhams, missed out this week on a bid for HMV.The cafe chain employed about 3,000 staff, but some 900 jobs were lost in the initial wave of closures after KPMG was appointed to run the business on 22 January.Last October, Patisserie Valerie, where entrepreneur Luke Johnson is the biggest shareholder, uncovered \"significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities\".The company said in a statement last month that it did not have enough money to meet its debts. Rescue talks with banks HSBC and Barclays to restructure the business broke down, leaving no option but administration.In addition to Patisserie Valerie, the company's other brands include Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker & Spice and Flour Power City. Finance director Chris Marsh was arrested after having been suspended by the company when the financial irregularities were uncovered. Also under investigation, by the Financial Reporting Council, are former Patisserie Valerie auditors Grant Thornton.Mr Ashley, who also owns English Premier League football club Newcastle United, made his name building budget chain Sports Direct into Britain's biggest sporting goods retailer. At a time when retailers are struggling, he is frequently linked as a potential buyer of any that get into financial trouble. He bought House of Fraser last year, and also acquired Evans Cycles and Agent Provocateur. Sports Direct has shareholdings in French Connection and Game Digital, and last week emerged as front runner to buy Sofa.com.Earlier this week, Canada's Sunrise Records beat Mr Ashley in a battle to by the music retailer HMV. Mr Ashley is thought to be facing several competing bids for Patisserie Valerie, including, according to reports, from Costa, the coffee chain bought by Coca-Cola last year.Billionaire Mr Ashley has shown faith in the High Street at a time when many bricks-and-mortar stores are struggling due to a combination of rising rents and increasing online competition.He says that to support the High Street, there should be a tax on firms which generate 20% of revenues from the internet.Despite acquiring several struggling retailers, analysts say that Mr Ashley is more of a opportunist than a strategist.Richard Hyman, a adviser to a number of retailers, recently told the BBC: \"Is [Mr Ashley] following a strategic plan? I don't think he is. Is he positively opportunistic? Yes. Has got the resources to take advantage of opportunities that come his way? Yes.\"And, Mr Hyman adds: \"Has he got courage? Yes\". ","103":"President Donald Trump's convicted former lawyer Michael Cohen is expected to accuse him of criminal conduct during a hearing on Capitol Hill.Speaking on Wednesday to a House of Representatives panel, Cohen will allege possible tax fraud and racist language by Mr Trump, say US media.The White House has questioned why lawmakers invited someone who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress.Cohen was sentenced to three years and will begin his custodial term in May.On Tuesday, he was officially disbarred from practising law by the New York State Supreme Court, New York media reported.The penalty came as he began three consecutive days of testimony in a closed-doors hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. His Wednesday testimony to the House Oversight Committee will be public.US media have published a copy of his opening statement online. The 52-year-old was convicted last year by New York federal prosecutors of campaign finance violations and tax evasion and by special counsel Robert Mueller of lying to Congress about Trump Organization plans in Moscow.Mr Mueller is nearing the end of a 21-month justice department investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, which both Mr Trump and Russia have denied.At his December sentencing Cohen, a former Trump loyalist, blamed his misdeeds on \"a blind loyalty\" to Mr Trump.Ahead of the hearings, the president tweeted an attack on his former lawyer, accusing him of \"lying in order to reduce his prison time\".Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately). He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying & fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time. Using Crooked\u2019s lawyer!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpThe Wall Street Journal reported a person familiar with the matter as saying Cohen would provide \"evidence of criminal conduct since Mr Trump became president\" that involved a hush money payment to conceal an alleged affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels.The lawyer will accuse Mr Trump of being directly involved in efforts to conceal the alleged affair weeks before the 2016 election, according to US media. The president has denied having the affair, or that he told Cohen to pay off Ms Daniels.According to the Journal, Cohen will detail Mr Trump's \"lies, racism and cheating\" over a decade of working for him.He is expected to offer financial documents showing possible tax fraud by Mr Trump, which may spur lawmakers to renew demands for the president's tax returns.The president's former right hand man will also describe racist remarks from Mr Trump during their private conversations. The Journal reports Cohen will accuse the president of questioning the intelligence of African Americans.CBS News reported a source as saying the racist language allegedly used by the president is \"chilling\".Cohen is also expected to offer explanations to lawmakers about why he lied to them about the Trump Organization's plans to build a tower in Moscow.Democrat Elijah Cummings, chair of the Oversight Committee, said last week lawmakers would question Cohen about Mr Trump's possible conflicts of interest and finances.Republicans, meanwhile, have highlighted Cohen's unreliability.In an op-ed in USA Today on Tuesday, Republican Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina called the hearing \"a partisan circus meant to destroy Trump\".Meanwhile, Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz is denying that a tweet directed at Cohen was a threat.In a text message exchange with a reporter for Vox, Mr Gaetz denied the tweet was considered witness-tampering, contending it was \"witness-testing\".It comes after Cohen's originally scheduled testimony was postponed, after he cited \"threats against his family\" brought by Mr Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani.","104":"It is unclear whether the UK government is planning for an emergency budget in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Welsh and Scottish ministers have said.Last year the Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK government will set a new budget if the UK exits without a deal.But Welsh Finance Minister Rebecca Evans, who met Chief Treasury Secretary Liz Truss on Friday, said extra funding was not \"open for discussion\".Ms Truss said ministers are ready to take action if necessary.Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, who also took part in the meeting, said he did not \"quite get\" the sense from Ms Truss that an emergency budget would be held.The meeting in Cardiff on Friday followed a further defeat for the prime minister's Brexit strategy in the House of Commons on Thursday night.MPs voted against a motion endorsing the government's strategy by 303 to 258, with 66 Tory MPs abstaining.Downing Street has insisted that Theresa May will press on with efforts to negotiate a revised Brexit deal with the EU.The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 - with or without a deal.With just six weeks to go until Brexit day, the Welsh and Scottish finance ministers said they were not \"reassured\" by the chief secretary to the Treasury about plans for a no-deal departure.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Evans said: \"We looked specifically at whether or not there would be a full fiscal event, so an emergency budget, following the potential of a no-deal Brexit. \"The chief secretary thought that wouldn't be necessary because again she's very much focussed on the fact that a deal can be made. \"However, we believe that we need to be preparing properly for all eventualities,\" she added.Asked whether there was any discussion of extra funding in the event of a no-deal funding, Ms Evans replied: \"No, that wasn't open for discussion.\"Derek Mackay, Scotland's finance secretary, also said: \"The chancellor said there would be an emergency budget - I didn't quite get that sense from the chief secretary of the Treasury today.\"The Welsh finance minister said the Welsh Government \"certainly haven't made preparations within our existing budget\" for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.\"Of course, we have Welsh reserves but again we would need to be looking at funding over and above that from the UK Government to respond to the variety of scenarios that could result from no-deal,\" Ms Evans added.Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss, said: \"The government is working for the best outcome for the UK, but preparing for every eventuality.\"I was clear at today's meeting that the government stands ready to take appropriate action if necessary.\"As the chancellor has said to Parliament, the Spring Statement is not a fiscal event, but if the economic or fiscal outlook changes materially then it is always open to us to turn it into a fiscal event.\" ","105":"Seven members of one family were among the 23 victims identified after an outbreak of tornadoes devastated the US state of Alabama, officials have said.Every victim, including four children, was found close to their homes, rescue crews say.The victims range in age from six to 89, Lee County Coroner Bill Harris told a news conference.Up to eight people remain missing, officials say, and there are fears the death toll could rise.\"We believe that every victim was in the residence when it hit. They all ended up, with the exception of two, outside the residence,\" Mr Harris told reporters, adding that their homes \"aren't there\". \"They're not there.\"He added that one survivor lost seven members of his family, and warned that he may be facing \"financial issues\" because of multiple funeral costs.\"They're going to have seven funerals that they have to finance somehow,\" he said, adding that donors have been reaching out to help the family with the expenses.The tornadoes struck eastern Alabama on Sunday, levelling homes and carving a path of at least a half mile (0.8km) wide in some parts of the state. Chris Buckler, BBC News, in BeauregardOn the edge of where the tornado struck, there is the constant buzzing of chainsaws as they try to clear up the hundreds of fallen trees.But up in the Beauregard neighbourhood which was directly in its path, there is silence. Where once there were homes there is now what can only be described as an emptiness.  All of the buildings have been levelled and from the road it's difficult to see that a community was once even here. There's no doubt that some of the most striking images are the cars, which have been smashed, overturned and in one case actually wrapped around a tree.When you wander through what was a garden and look through the flattened remains, you discover the remnants of people's lives. Single shoes, an iron and what looks like an old schoolbag. There are a few figures wandering around amid all of the devastation looking numb and bewildered. At times they seem to be struggling to remember what was once here on this flattened landscape.Frederick Franklin was standing by the debris of one house, trying to piece together where the rooms once stood from the foundations of the building.\"It was my brother's fianc\u00e9's place,\" he told me. \"She and one of her brothers were killed in it. You can't describe it. This is nature at its worst.\"Temperatures dropped below freezing on Tuesday as volunteer crews sorted through debris, looking for survivors and bodies.On Monday, weather officials upgraded the fatal twister that hit Lee County to EF-4 with wind speeds of 170 mph (275km\/h).Almost 50 people were injured and numerous homes and businesses were reduced to rubble as multiple tornadoes touched down in south-east Alabama and Georgia.During Tuesday's briefing, an official with the National Weather Service said the deadliest tornado had travelled for about 70 miles, and another nearby travelled for 29 miles.Bags of ice and medications are being made available to residents, who have been told they should start bringing debris out to the street for it to be removed by county rubbish crews.Some residents who narrowly survived the onslaught have travelled to shelters to lend a hand and donate goods.\"I had a friend who lost his life, and just my heart spoke,\" Stephanie Griffith tearfully told WVTM-TV as she dropped off supplies at a shelter in Lee County. \"So I went through my home this morning I got things that I'm not going to use and I know they'll be needed here.\"This young lady epitomizes what it means to be \"Beauregard Strong\".

She told her mother and son to run to the bathroom, where all three generations piled on the bathroom floor to weigh each other down.\"That's when everything started shaking. It was so strong,\" Mrs Wilson told BBC News. \"I held my son's hand as he was yelling 'I don't want to die!' My mom just kept reminding us to pray.\"She said that after the winds lifted, her home was \"no longer recognisable\" and was \"in shreds\".Her elderly mother, who requires an oxygen tank, suffered a broken hip. Mrs Wilson fractured her ankle, but was grateful to have escaped.Other residents hid in bathtubs in homes without basements, sometime with mattresses pulled over them.\"We knew we were flying because it picked the house up,\" Julie Morrison told the Associated Press (AP), adding that they thought they had survived because of the fibre-glass that their home is made from.Greg Molinari told AL.com that he and his wife would have died if not for a text message from their daughter-in-law.\"She said get in the bathroom and put pots on your head.

He was the reason I lived, the reason that I got up.\"Seven members of the same extended family connected by marriage - including members of the Stenson, Tate and Robinson families - died in the storm.Four children, ages 6, 8, 9 and 10, were also listed among the dead.","106":"Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer, appeared on Wednesday before the House of Representatives Oversight Committee in Washington, DC. In his prepared remarks, he let loose with explosive accusations directed toward Mr Trump that touched on a number of controversies related to his presidency. Here is Mr Cohen's opening statement in full.Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today.I have asked this Committee to ensure that my family be protected from Presidential threats, and that the Committee be sensitive to the questions pertaining to ongoing investigations. Thank you for your help and for your understanding.I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the Committee's questions truthfully, and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump.I recognize that some of you may doubt and attack me on my credibility. It is for this reason that I have incorporated into this opening statement documents that are irrefutable, and demonstrate that the information you will hear is accurate and truthful.Never in a million years did I imagine, when I accepted a job in 2007 to work for Donald Trump, that he would one day run for President, launch a campaign on a platform of hate and intolerance, and actually win. I regret the day I said \"yes\" to Mr Trump. I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way.I am ashamed of my own failings, and I publicly accepted responsibility for them by pleading guilty in the Southern District of New York.I am ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty - of the things I did for Mr Trump in an effort to protect and promote him.I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr Trump's illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience.I am ashamed because I know what Mr Trump is.He is a racist.He is a conman.He is a cheat.He was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails.I will explain each in a few moments.I am providing the Committee today with several documents. These include:I hope my appearance here today, my guilty plea, and my work with law enforcement agencies are steps along a path of redemption that will restore faith in me and help this country understand our president better.Before going further, I want to apologize to each of you and to Congress as a whole.The last time I appeared before Congress, I came to protect Mr Trump.Today, I'm here to tell the truth about Mr Trump.I lied to Congress about when Mr Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016. That was false - our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign.Mr Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That's not how he operates.In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there's no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie.There were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa Caucus in January 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me \"How's it going in Russia?\" - referring to the Moscow Tower project.You need to know that Mr Trump's personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it.To be clear: Mr Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.And so I lied about it, too - because Mr Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress.Over the past two years, I have been smeared as \"a rat\" by the President of the United States. The truth is much different, and let me take a brief moment to introduce myself.My name is Michael Dean Cohen.I am a blessed husband of 24 years and a father to an incredible daughter and son. When I married my wife, I promised her that I would love her, cherish her, and protect her. As my father said countless times throughout my childhood, \"you my wife, and you my children, are the air that I breathe.\"To my Laura, my Sami, and my Jake, there is nothing I wouldn't do to protect you.I have always tried to live a life of loyalty, friendship, generosity, and compassion - qualities my parents ingrained in my siblings and me since childhood. My father survived the Holocaust thanks to the compassion and selfless acts of others. He was helped by many who put themselves in harm's way to do what they knew was right.That is why my first instinct has always been to help those in need. Mom and Dad\u2026I am sorry that I let you down.As many people that know me best would say, I am the person they would call at 3:00 am if they needed help. I proudly remember being the emergency contact for many of my children's friends when they were growing up because their parents knew that I would drop everything and care for them as if they were my own.Yet, last fall I pled guilty in federal court to felonies for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in coordination with Individual #1.For the record: Individual #1 is President Donald J Trump.It is painful to admit that I was motivated by ambition at times. It is even more painful to admit that many times I ignored my conscience and acted loyal to a man when I should not have. Sitting here today, it seems unbelievable that I was so mesmerized by Donald Trump that I was willing to do things for him that I knew were absolutely wrong.For that reason, I have come here to apologize to my family, to the government, and to the American people.Accordingly, let me now tell you about Mr Trump.I got to know him very well, working very closely with him for more than 10 years, as his Executive Vice President and Special Counsel and then personal attorney when he became President. When I first met Mr Trump, he was a successful entrepreneur, a real estate giant, and an icon. Being around Mr Trump was intoxicating. When you were in his presence, you felt like you were involved in something greater than yourself -- that you were somehow changing the world.I wound up touting the Trump narrative for over a decade. That was my job.Always stay on message. Always defend. It monopolized my life. At first, I worked mostly on real estate developments and other business transactions. Shortly thereafter, Mr Trump brought me into his personal life and private dealings. Over time, I saw his true character revealed.Mr Trump is an enigma. He is complicated, as am I. He has both good and bad, as do we all. But the bad far outweighs the good, and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself. He is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal. Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation - only to market himself and to build his wealth and power. Mr Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the \"greatest infomercial in political history.\"He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign - for him - was always a marketing opportunity.I knew early on in my work for Mr Trump that he would direct me to lie to further his business interests. I am ashamed to say, that when it was for a real estate mogul in the private sector, I considered it trivial. As the President, I consider it significant and dangerous.But in the mix, lying for Mr Trump was normalized, and no one around him questioned it. In fairness, no one around him today questions it, either.A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes.As I earlier stated, Mr Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails.In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump's office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone.Mr Trump put Mr Stone on the speakerphone. Mr Stone told Mr Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr Assange told Mr Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign.Mr Trump responded by stating to the effect of \"wouldn't that be great.\"Mr Trump is a racist. The country has seen Mr Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries \"shitholes.\"In private, he is even worse.He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn't a \"shithole.\" This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States.While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way.And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.And yet I continued to work for him. Mr Trump is a cheat.As previously stated, I'm giving the Committee today three years of President Trump's financial statements, from 2011-2013, which he gave to Deutsche Bank to inquire about a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills and to Forbes. These are Exhibits 1a, 1b, and 1c to my testimony.It was my experience that Mr Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.I am sharing with you two newspaper articles, side by side, that are examples of Mr Trump inflating and deflating his assets, as I said, to suit his financial interests. These are Exhibit 2 to my testimony.As I noted, I'm giving the Committee today an article he wrote on, and sent me, that reported on an auction of a portrait of Mr Trump. This is Exhibit 3A to my testimony.Mr Trump directed me to find a straw bidder to purchase a portrait of him that was being auctioned at an Art Hamptons Event. The objective was to ensure that his portrait, which was going to be auctioned last, would go for the highest price of any portrait that afternoon. The portrait was purchased by the fake bidder for $60,000. Mr Trump directed the Trump Foundation, which is supposed to be a charitable organization, to repay the fake bidder, despite keeping the art for himself. Please see Exhibit 3B to my testimony.And it should come as no surprise that one of my more common responsibilities was that Mr Trump directed me to call business owners, many of whom were small businesses, that were owed money for their services and told them no payment or a reduced payment would be coming. When I advised Mr Trump of my success, he actually reveled in it.And yet, I continued to work for him.Mr Trump is a conman.He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did. Lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets. She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly - and she did not deserve that.I am giving the Committee today a copy of the $130,000 wire transfer from me to Ms Clifford's attorney during the closing days of the presidential campaign that was demanded by Ms Clifford to maintain her silence about her affair with Mr Trump. This is Exhibit 4 to my testimony.Mr Trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a Home Equity Line of Credit to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign. I did that, too - without bothering to consider whether that was improper, much less whether it was the right thing to do or how it would impact me, my family, or the public.I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later.As Exhibit 5 to my testimony shows, I am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank account on August 1, 2017 - when he was President of the United States - pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me - the word used by Mr Trump's TV lawyer -- for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf. This $35,000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year - while he was President.The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws. You can find the details of that scheme, directed by Mr Trump, in the pleadings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.So picture this scene - in February 2017, one month into his presidency,I'm visiting President Trump in the Oval Office for the first time. It's truly awe-inspiring, he's showing me around and pointing to different paintings, and he says to me something to the effect of\u2026Don't worry, Michael, your January and February reimbursement checks are coming. They were Fed-Exed from New York and it takes a while for that to get through the White House system. As he promised, I received the first check for the reimbursement of $70,000 not long thereafter.When I say conman, I'm talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores.As I mentioned, I'm giving the Committee today copies of a letter I sent at Mr Trump's direction threatening these schools with civil and criminal actions if Mr Trump's grades or SAT scores were ever disclosed without his permission. These are Exhibit 6.The irony wasn't lost on me at the time that Mr Trump in 2011 had strongly criticized President Obama for not releasing his grades. As you can see inExhibit 7, Mr Trump declared \"Let him show his records\" after calling President Obama \"a terrible student.\"The sad fact is that I never heard Mr Trump say anything in private that led me to believe he loved our nation or wanted to make it better. In fact, he did the opposite.When telling me in 2008 that he was cutting employees' salaries in half - including mine - he showed me what he claimed was a $10 million IRS tax refund, and he said that he could not believe how stupid the government was for giving \"someone like him\" that much money back.During the campaign, Mr Trump said he did not consider Vietnam Veteran, and Prisoner of War, Senator John McCain to be \"a hero\" because he likes people who weren't captured. At the same time, Mr Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft.Mr Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment.He finished the conversation with the following comment. \"You think I'm stupid, I wasn't going to Vietnam.\"I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now.And yet, I continued to work for him.Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions.Sometime in the summer of 2017, I read all over the media that there had been a meeting in Trump Tower in June 2016 involving Don Jr and others from the campaign with Russians, including a representative of the Russian government, and an email setting up the meeting with the subject line, \"Dirt on Hillary Clinton.\" Something clicked in my mind. I remember being in the room with Mr Trump, probably in early June 2016, when something peculiar happened. Don Jr came into the room and walked behind his father's desk - which in itself was unusual. People didn't just walk behind Mr Trump's desk to talk to him. I recalled Don Jr leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying: \"The meeting is all set.\" I remember Mr. Trump saying, \"Ok good\u2026let me know.\"What struck me as I looked back and thought about that exchange between Don Jr and his father was, first, that Mr Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr had the worst judgment of anyone in the world. And also, that Don Jr would never set up any meeting of any significance alone - and certainly not without checking with his father.I also knew that nothing went on in Trump world, especially the campaign, without Mr Trump's knowledge and approval. So, I concluded that Don Jr was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representative when he walked behind his dad's desk that day -- and that Mr Trump knew that was the meeting Don Jr was talking about when he said, \"That's good\u2026let me know.\"Over the past year or so, I have done some real soul searching. I see now that my ambition and the intoxication of Trump power had much to do with the bad decisions I made.To you, Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, the other members of this Committee, and the other members of the House and Senate, I am sorry for my lies and for lying to Congress.To our nation, I am sorry for actively working to hide from you the truth about Mr Trump when you needed it most.For those who question my motives for being here today, I understand. I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your \"fixer,\" Mr Trump.I am going to prison and have shattered the safety and security that I tried so hard to provide for my family. My testimony certainly does not diminish the pain I caused my family and friends - nothing can do that. And I have never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump.And, by coming today, I have caused my family to be the target of personal, scurrilous attacks by the President and his lawyer - trying to intimidate me from appearing before this panel. Mr Trump called me a \"rat\" for choosing to tell the truth - much like a mobster would do when one of his men decides to cooperate with the government.As Exhibit 8 shows, I have provided the Committee with copies of Tweets that Mr Trump posted, attacking me and my family - only someone burying his head in the sand would not recognize them for what they are: encouragement to someone to do harm to me and my family.I never imagined that he would engage in vicious, false attacks on my family - and unleash his TV-lawyer to do the same. I hope this committee and all members of Congress on both sides of the aisle will make it clear:As a nation, we should not tolerate attempts to intimidate witnesses before congress and attacks on family are out of bounds and not acceptable.I wish to especially thank Speaker Pelosi for her statements in Exhibit 9 to protect this institution and me, and the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Adam Schiff and Chairman Cummings for likewise defending this institution and my family against the attacks by Mr Trump, and also the many Republicans who have admonished the President as well.I am not a perfect man. I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life.But today, I get to decide the example I set for my children and how I attempt to change how history will remember me. I may not be able to change the past, but I can do right by the American people here today.Thank you for your attention. I am happy to answer the Committee's questions.","107":"Mike Ashley's Sports Direct has cancelled a bid for collapsed cafe chain Patisserie Valerie, just two days after making an offer.The retail billionaire announced his bid for the chain on Friday evening.Sports Direct offered \u00a315m, but was told by administrator KPMG it would need to offer up to \u00a32m more than this, according to the Financial Times.Patisserie Valerie collapsed last month. KPMG closed 70 outlets, but kept 121 open in the hope of selling them.Mr Ashley is thought to be facing several competing bids for Patisserie Valerie, including, according to reports, from Costa, the coffee chain bought by Coca-Cola last year.The retail tycoon, who also owns English Premier League football club Newcastle United, made his name building budget chain Sports Direct into Britain's biggest sporting goods retailer. He has since become known for buying up struggling retail chains and bought both department store chain House of Fraser and cycle shop Evans out of administration last year.Sports Direct's sprawling High Street empire also includes lingerie chain Agent Provocateur as well as shareholdings in Debenhams, French Connection and Game Digital. Last week, it emerged as front runner to buy Sofa.com.Patisserie Valerie collapsed after an accounting scandal which left the firm without enough money to pay its debts. Rescue talks with banks HSBC and Barclays to restructure the business broke down, leaving no option but administration.The cafe chain employed about 3,000 staff, but some 900 jobs were lost in the initial wave of closures after KPMG was appointed to run the business on 22 January.In addition to Patisserie Valerie, the company's other brands include Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker & Spice and Flour Power City. The Serious Fraud Office is carrying out a criminal investigation into Patisserie Valerie and finance director Chris Marsh was arrested and released on bail after having been suspended by the company. Also under investigation, by the Financial Reporting Council, are former Patisserie Valerie auditors Grant Thornton.","108":"South African authorities have said that controversial businessman Ajay Gupta is no longer wanted by police.An arrest warrant for Mr Gupta, issued in February 2018 for corruption charges, was cancelled on Thursday.The authorities had sought to question Mr Gupta on allegations that he attempted to bribe former deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas.   Mr Gupta, who is a close friend of ex-President Jacob Zuma, maintains his innocence and denies knowing Mr Jonas.Mr Jonas told the commission investigating state corruption that Mr Gupta had offered him a $42m (\u00a332m) bribe to take up the post of finance minister.  He said this happened during a meeting set up by Duduzane Zuma - Mr Zuma's son. Corruption charges against Duduzane Zuma were provisionally withdrawn last month, while evidence continues to be heard by the corruption commission.  As a consequence, police say, they had to withdraw the arrest warrant against Mr Gupta. It was exactly a year ago on Thursday that the elite Hawks police unit shocked South Africa by raiding the Guptas' lavish compound in Johannesburg, only to find that the brothers had disappeared abroad.According to the BBC's Vauldi Carelse in Johannesburg, Mr Gupta is believed to be living in Dubai. Local media have reported that arrest warrants have also been issued for the two other Gupta brothers, but this has not been confirmed by the Hawks.","109":"The UK's efforts to tackle money-laundering are \"highly fragmented\" and need greater focus, an influential committee of MPs has warned.Companies House and estate agents were the biggest weaknesses in the system, said the Treasury Committee.It urged the government not to compromise on economic crime in order to secure post-Brexit trade deals.Committee chair Nicky Morgan said the UK's departure from the EU would bring \"both risks and opportunities\".But the government should not \"bow to buccaneering regulatory pressures\", she added.The committee said there were two areas of particular concern in the UK's \"fragmented\" anti-money-laundering supervision:The committee also suggested changes in the law, including the introduction of a new offence of failing to prevent economic crime and making the \"highly fragmented \" supervision system the responsibility of one supervisory body.The Treasury Committee said increasing trade with non-EU countries would make UK businesses more likely to come into contact with markets that had lower anti-money-laundering standards.But as well as that risk, there would also be \"an opportunity for the UK to be a beacon in the world for the high standards to which we aspire\".\"When conducting trade negotiations, the government must be clear about its intention to lead the fight against economic crime, and not compromise by shifting to a more buccaneering role in an effort to secure trade deals,\" it said. \"The government must also ensure that the flow of information between the EU and UK's enforcement agencies is retained or replicated post-Brexit.\"The committee said the scale of economic crime in the UK was \"very uncertain, with estimates ranging from the tens of billions of pounds to the hundreds of billions\". \"The government should provide a more precise estimate, so that the response can be tailored to the problem.\"There is already evidence that London attracts suspected \"dirty money\" from a number of international sources, including Russia.The National Crime Agency has estimated that each year, \u00a3100bn of dirty money that may be the proceeds of crime is laundered through the City of London.A government spokesperson said: \"There is absolutely no place for illicit finance in the UK, which is why we've made targeting economic criminals a priority. We've passed legislation on criminal finances and bribery, developed powerful new tools for law enforcement, and created the new National Economic Crime Centre. \"The Financial Action Taskforce, the global standard-setter for counter-terrorist financing, recognised our efforts in December, praising the UK as a global leader that aggressively identifies, pursues and prioritises money laundering investigations and prosecutions.\"","110":"The world's richest man, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has accused the owner of a US gossip magazine of trying to blackmail him over private pictures.He said the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc (AMI), wanted him to stop investigating how they had obtained his private messages.Hours after Mr Bezos announced his divorce last month, the magazine published details, including private messages, of an extramarital affair. AMI says the company \"acted lawfully\".\"American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr Bezos. Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him,\" the company said in a statement. \"Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.\"In a stunning blog post on Thursday, Mr Bezos posted an email he said had been sent to his intermediaries by AMI's representatives threatening to publish \"intimate photos\" of him and his lover, former TV host Lauren Sanchez.The billionaire, who also owns the Washington Post newspaper, said AMI had wanted him to make a \"false public statement\" that the National Enquirer's coverage of him and his mistress was not politically motivated.According to emails included by Mr Bezos in his blog, an AMI lawyer proposed on Wednesday that the photos would not be published in return for a public statement \"affirming that [Bezos and his team] have no knowledge or basis\" to suspect such a motive. It comes after Mr Bezos' investigator suggested they had \"strong leads\" to suspect political reasons.\"Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail,\" wrote Mr Bezos, \"I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten.\"Early in the blog post, Mr Bezos mentions AMI's links to President Donald Trump.Reacting to the allegations on Friday, AMI said the company \"believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr Bezos\".AMI said that they had been \"in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him\" when the allegations were made, and that the board \"has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims\".Mr Bezos said his ownership of the Washington Post was a \"complexifier\" for him because he had made enemies of \"certain powerful people\", including President Trump, who is a friend of AMI's boss, David Pecker.AMI recently admitted in court that it had co-ordinated with the Trump presidential campaign to pay a Playboy model $150,000 (\u00a3115,000) in hush money to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Mr Trump.Mr Bezos notes in his blog post how the publisher had confessed to the so-called \"catch and kill\" deal to bury Karen McDougal's politically embarrassing story.AMI's agreement to co-operate with federal authorities means it will not face criminal charges over the payments, Manhattan prosecutors announced in December.Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen - who facilitated the hush money at the direction, he says, of Mr Trump - has already admitted violating campaign finance laws.The Amazon boss did not try to hide the potential for embarrassment, writing \"of course I don't want personal photos published\" and noting what he called \"AMI's long-earned reputation for weaponising journalistic privileges\". \"But,\" he continued, \"I also won't participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favours, political attacks, and corruption. \"I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\"His blog contained itemised details of 10 pictures in an email from the magazine's editor, Dylan Howard, who said they had been \"obtained during our newsgathering\". New Yorker writer Ronan Farrow tweeted that he \"and at least one other prominent journalist\" had been subject to similar \"stop digging or we'll ruin you\" threats from AMI. Mr Bezos said \"AMI's claim of newsworthiness is that the photos are necessary to show Amazon shareholders that my business judgment is terrible\". But the Amazon boss countered that the firm's results \"speak for themselves\".Dylan Howard's name, along with those of two National Enquirer reporters, appeared on an 11-page story the magazine published on 9 January containing alleged details of Mr Bezos' affair with Ms Sanchez. The tabloid labelled it \"the biggest investigation in Enquirer history!\".This has been the focus of Mr Bezos's private investigators. The probe has been led by security Gavin de Becker - who is the billionaire's long-term head of security.He has said that \"strong leads point to political motives\" over the leak, but has not divulged much further information.Last week he said Lauren Sanchez's brother, Michael, had become one of the focuses of their investigation. Mr Sanchez, a publicist who lives in West Hollywood, has strongly rejected involvement.\"I am not dignifying de Becker's passive aggressive allegations or his crazy conspiracy theories,\" he said in a statement to Page Six. He also said he had recommended his sister fire Mr de Becker. US media report that Mr Sanchez knows AMI's David Pecker - as well as other people with links to Mr Trump including his former campaign aides Carter Page and Roger Stone. Mr Stone was indicted by the special counsel's Russia investigation last month. He has confirmed to the Daily Beast that he knows Mr Sanchez - describing him as a \"very good guy\".

Dundee-based McGill went bust last month due to \"challenging trading conditions\" and administrators were appointed to find a new buyer. Catalus Energy Investments has now taken over the 38-year-old firm and its Dundee offices. An assessment of the order book is now being made to see if any of the axed staff can be re-hired. The 55 McGill employees retained by administrators to help with the sale have now also been made redundant.Catalus Energy Investments, which is based in Dundee, is described as \"a group of professionals specialising in the consolidation of industries, mergers and acquisitions, finance and growth\".Property developer Graeme Carling, a director of Catalus, said his firm \"plan to build a quality and skilled workforce to deliver on profitable contracts\". He added: \"Over the past month we have worked tirelessly to reach an agreement which allows us to move forward with our plans to re-establish McGill & Co.\"Our team has examined all information available to us and we now enter a period of engagement with previous customers and contracts.\"Blair Nimmo, who is joint administrator for McGill and is head of restructuring for KPMG, said:  \"We are very pleased to have concluded the sale of these assets to Catalus Energy Investments, which will provide the best outcome for the company's creditors and may also generate the opportunity for future employment.\"","112":"Marvel stars Letitia Wright and Tom Holland are among the UK celebrities named on Forbes magazine's 30 Under 30 Europe list for 2019.It's a list that recognises young talent and is released every year by the US publication.The Favourite actor Joe Alwyn is also on the list, alongside Lily James and Killing Eve star Jodie Comer.Music artists Ella Mai, Octavian and Jess Glynne are also recognised in the annual round-up.Other UK celebrities which make the list include Daniel Radcliffe, Jorja Smith and George Ezra. Tom Holland earned his spot for his appearance as Spider-Man, say Forbes, a role he began before turning 20.Letitia Wright is honoured for her part in Oscar-nominated Black Panther - which earned more than $1bn (\u00a3794m) at the box office.  Octavian is named due to him topping the BBC's Sound of 2019 list - after surviving homelessness and poverty, says Forbes.But it's not just celebrities who have been recognised on the list of 300 names.Coder Anisah Osman Britton is named for the coding school 23 Code Street, which she launched for women and non-binary individuals to help balance a male-dominated industry.\"Apple released a health app that had no period checker a few years ago, that for me was a big catalyst into why we needed more women in the industry,\" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.23 Code Street not only teaches coding in London, but for every paying student in the UK, the school also educates women in the slums of Mumbai.\"The world is changing so fast and the people left behind tend to be the most disenfranchised,\" she says. \"In India right now, that's women from the most disadvantaged communities.\"The three co-founders of Birdsong, a feminist clothing brand, also make the list with their ethical fashion store.They don't use Photoshop on images of their models and pay the women who make the clothes they sell up to 80% of the proceeds.Sophie Slater, one of Birdsong's three founders, says they will celebrate their inclusion when they find the time.\"We've just booked some drinks in for 10 days' time because we're so busy until then,\" she  tells Newsbeat.\"It's really hard work running the business so we've got to make sure we keep stock of these little wins and soak it up as much as we can.\"There's always another challenge round the corner, so it's quite easy to forget when we've got something to be really proud of and celebrate.\"She says she hopes some of the major online retailers will try to become more ethical in 2019.Under 30s from finance, technology, gaming and media are also honoured in this year's list.Forbes describes the 300 people named as \"young disruptors\" who are \"bringing new ideas to the old world\" and states that the people named have positive opinions about Europe following Brexit.It claims that 92% of its 30 Under 30 are \"optimistic\" about the future of start-ups on the continent.Forbes first launched its 30 Under 30 list in 2011 in America, and introduced the Europe list in 2016.The list names 30 influential young people across 10 categories - including art and culture, manufacturing and industry and science and healthcare.You can see the full list here.Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here.","113":"More than four in 10 businesses in the UK are unaware of the risks posed by invoice fraud, according to a survey by banking trade body UK Finance.That is despite such scams costing firms almost \u00a393m in 2018, it says.Scams take place when fraudsters trick firms into transferring money by posing as legitimate payees. There were 3,280 invoice and bank mandate scam cases involving businesses over the year, with an average loss per case of more than \u00a328,000. Some \u00a329.6m of the money lost to this type of fraud was fortunately returned to business customers, the trade body says.UK Finance surveyed 1,500 firms across the UK and found that 55% of sole traders were aware of the threat of invoice fraud, compared with 68% of small businesses and 84% of large businesses. Large businesses were more likely to have taken steps to protect themselves against such scams. But they were also more likely to have experienced invoice fraud than smaller firms.\"Invoice fraud could happen to businesses of all sizes,\" said Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance.\"The gangs behind this type of fraud are increasingly sophisticated and will often get hold of details that allow them to pose convincingly as regular suppliers.\"If someone contacts you asking for a supplier's bank account details to be changed, always verify with that supplier separately on the phone or in person, using the contact details you have on file.\"Invoice fraud involves criminals targeting businesses by posing as a regular supplier and making a request for their bank account details to be changed, often by email. Businesses are then tricked into sending money to an account controlled by the fraudster rather than the genuine supplier. Often the criminals will try to acquire details from businesses, such as the date when regular payments are due, to make their approach more convincing.UK Finance says if you are making a payment to an account for the first time, transfer a small sum first.Then check with the company - using known contact details - to check that the payment has been received and that the account details are correct.\"Contact your bank straight away if you think you may have fallen victim to an invoice or mandate scam,\" the trade body adds.","114":"\"Nobody knows what it is,\" is the verdict of Zimbabwe's former trade minister and now opposition politician Nkosana Moyo.He was talking about what appears to be a new currency in the country.It has been introduced over the last few days but its impact is not yet clear.Zimbabwe has a troubled history with currency.In 2009 it ditched the Zimbabwe dollar and adopted the US dollar after hyperinflation destroyed its value. At its height prices were almost doubling every day and the reserve bank printed notes worth 100tn Zimbabwe dollars to try and keep up.But because more US dollars were leaving the country - in the form of payments for exports - than coming in, US dollar cash was in short supply. This led to long bank queues as people struggled to get their money out.In 2016, the government introduced bond notes and coins, which were supposed to be worth the same as the US dollar, to make up for the cash shortage.But no-one had faith that they were equivalent and, on the black market, bond notes have lost value against the dollar.And now the government has introduced the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) dollar, which is being described by some as a new currency.It's not a phrase that exactly rolls off the tongue, but the initials are familiar to Zimbabweans who have been using them to describe money that has been electronically transferred into their bank accounts.As well as paying for goods in US dollars, Zimbabweans have been able to use other foreign currencies such as the South African rand, plus bond notes, debit cards drawing on bank accounts and money stored on a mobile phone app.But each of them had a different exchange rate, meaning that customers were sometimes charged different prices depending on what payment method they chose.You may also be interested in:The RTGS dollar is supposed to bring together bond notes and debit card and mobile money payments to make sure that they are all worth the same.Significantly, the government has given up on the pretence that the bond note and the US dollar have the same value. Now it is saying that the value of the RTGS dollar against the US dollar will be set by the market.While business journalists and commentators are saying that there is a new currency, the government has not used this phrase.The Zimbabwe dollar has such a tarnished history that the government is reluctant to be seen to be returning to this.At its simplest, a currency is something that is widely accepted as a means to buy goods and services.From now on the government wants things priced in RTGS dollars, rather than US dollars, and people should be able to use the various payment methods denominated in RTGS - debit cards, bond notes and mobile phone money - to purchase them.So it feels like a currency but there are no plans to have notes and coins with \"RTGS dollars\" written on them and you cannot use them outside the country.The government has said it wants the price of the RTGS dollar to be determined by the market.It initially suggested that it should trade at 2.5 RTGS dollars to the US dollar, but this was significantly less than the black market rate for the bond note, which was selling at more than 3.5 to the dollar.If the RTGS dollar is truly allowed to float without intervention then the black market should be eliminated altogether.At this point it is not clear.The government hopes that it will make things simpler as there won't be different prices quoted according to the various currencies and payment methods.It also hopes that prices will stay the same or even decline as stability and predictability is brought into the market.Zimbabwe has been hit by rising inflation and increasing levels of government debt for many years.But if the RTGS dollar is the solution, then the government is \"misdiagnosing the problem\", opposition politician Mr Moyo says.He argues that poor economic management is at the heart of the problem, saying that government expenditure needs to be reined in.But Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube insists that austerity measures he introduced in last year's budget are working and government revenue is increasing.As long as the government does not try to manage the RTGS dollar exchange rate, then this is a step in the right direction, says the chief economist at Renaissance Capital, Charlie Robertson.But given the history that Zimbabwe has with currencies, it will take a lot to restore people's trust, he adds. ","115":"Venezuela's opposition leader has told the BBC that people are living in a \"dictatorship\", and renewed his calls for fresh elections. Juan Guaid\u00f3 declared himself interim president last week.While the US and others back him, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has major allies too including Russia.Meanwhile, Attorney General Tarek William Saab has ordered that Mr Guaid\u00f3 be barred from leaving Venezuela and have his assets frozen.In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Saab's office said violent incidents and interference from foreign governments suggested \"the commission of serious crimes that attack the constitutional order\".At least 40 people are believed to have died and hundreds have been arrested since 21 January, the UN says.Protests have been growing since Mr Maduro began a second term as president this month. He was elected last year during a controversial vote in which many opposition candidates were barred from running, or jailed.Venezuela has been struggling with a massive economic crisis. Hyperinflation and shortages of essentials such as food and medicine have forced millions to flee the nation.Speaking to BBC Mundo in Caracas on Monday, he defended his claim to be interim leader.Mr Guaid\u00f3 said the Venezuelan constitution allowed him, as the head of the National Assembly, to take power when the president was considered to be illegitimate.\"My duty is to call for free elections because there is an abuse of power and we live in a dictatorship,\" Mr Guaid\u00f3 said.He added: \"In Venezuela, we either accept domination, total oppression and torture... from Maduro's regime, or we choose freedom, democracy and prosperity for our people.\"Mr Guaid\u00f3 said the Maduro administration was \"killing young poor people\" in the streets.He has pledged to act as interim leader to oversee fresh elections. However, his declaration of leadership has divided the international community.Mr Guaid\u00f3 has called for further demonstrations this week, after tens of thousands came out to protest against Mr Maduro last Wednesday.On Monday US National Security Adviser John Bolton announced sanctions against Venezuela's state-owned oil firm PDVSA to ensure that President Maduro could \"no longer loot the assets of the Venezuelan people\". He also hinted at possible military action, reiterating that \"all options are on the table\". Mr Bolton appeared at a news briefing with a notepad containing the words \"5,000 troops to Colombia\", which borders Venezuela. On Tuesday acting US Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan declined to say whether the Pentagon was considering sending troops. \"I haven't discussed that with Secretary Bolton,\" he told reporters.Also on Tuesday, the United States said it has handed control of Venezuela's US bank accounts to Mr Guaid\u00f3.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the sanctions violated \"all possible international norms\" and \"pledged to do everything to support the legitimate government of President Maduro\". In New York, Venezuelan ambassador to the UN Jorge Valero accused the US administration of preparing a \"military invasion\". Venezuela broke off relations with the US last week in response to its recognition of Mr Guaid\u00f3 as interim leader and ordered all US diplomats to leave the country.On Tuesday the state department issued a travel advisory urging US nationals not to go to Venezuela because of \"civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, and arbitrary arrest and detention of US citizens\".More than 20 countries have followed the US in recognising Mr Guaid\u00f3 as interim president.Russia, China and Turkey are among those who have publicly backed Mr Maduro.On Saturday, several European countries including Spain, Germany, France and the UK said they would recognise Mr Guaid\u00f3 as president if elections were not called within eight days.","116":"The Scottish government's budget plans for the coming year have been formally approved by the Scottish Parliament.The budget will widen the gap between how much income tax higher earners in Scotland pay compared to the rest of the UK.But it will also provide extra funding for education, the health service and infrastructure.MSPs voted by 66 to 58 to approve the plans, after the SNP government struck a deal with the Scottish Greens.As part of the agreement, councils could be given new powers to introduce taxes on workplace car parking spaces and tourism - with the government also agreeing to increase core local government funding by \u00a390m and to hold cross-party talks on replacing the council tax. Local authorities will also be able to increase council tax by up to 4.79% rather than 3%, with the government also committing in principle to introducing a charge on disposable drinks cups - a so-called \"latte levy\".The Scottish Conservatives are strongly opposed to the workplace parking tax, which the party has claimed will hit low-paid workers hardest. And Scottish Labour has insisted that councils were still facing a real-terms cut in core funding, which will lead to cuts to local services.When he first unveiled his budget proposals, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay confirmed he would not pass on a tax break for higher earners that was announced by UK Chancellor Philip Hammond in October.Mr Mackay has done this by freezing the higher rate threshold at \u00a343,430 in Scotland - while it will go up to \u00a350,000 in the rest of the UK from April.It means people earning \u00a340,000 in Scotland will be \u00a3130 a year worse off than their equivalents elsewhere in the UK, increasing to a gap of nearly \u00a3500 a year for those on \u00a345,000.The proposals also mean that everyone earning under \u00a327,000 in Scotland - about 55% of taxpayers - will pay less income tax than those on the same salary elsewhere in the UK.But they will only be a maximum of just over \u00a320 a year better off, according to economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute.Mr Mackay has also said everyone earning under about \u00a3124,000 in Scotland will pay less tax than they did last year. Among Mr Mackay's key pledges in his \u00a334bn budget are:Read our full at-a-glance guide to the Scottish budget here.The finance secretary said his budget \"prepares our economy for the opportunity of the future, enables the transformation of essential public services, and builds a more inclusive and just society\".He has also insisted that \"now is not the time to cut tax for the highest earners at the expense of our public services\" - arguing that not passing on the tax break given to higher earners elsewhere in the UK will raise an additional \u00a368m for Scottish public services.But he has warned that he may have to change his budget plans if the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal.Ahead of the budget vote, the Scottish government repeated its warnings about the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on Scotland, which it has claimed could push the country's economy into recession. In an analysis paper, it suggests Scotland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) could fall by up to 7%. Trade with the EU could also be \"significantly impaired\", with a forecast for a potential drop in Scottish exports of between 10% and 20%.Mr Mackay has previously said he may have to introduce new budget measures if the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal in place. The UK government has argued that the best way to avoid no-deal is for MPs to back the prime minister's proposed deal with the EU - which the SNP has voted against.The budget passed with the support of the Scottish Greens for the third year in a row.The party says its agreement with the government \"provides councils with longer-term stability through multi-year funding deals, greater autonomy with plans to devolve powers over local taxes, and a commitment to work on a replacement for the outdated and unfair council tax\".Co-convener Patrick Harvie said the budget was \"not perfect\", but had been improved by the deal with his party, and criticised other parties for not engaging constructively in talks.However, the Scottish Conservatives have described the budget as a \"triple tax bombshell\" which will do nothing for the competitiveness of the Scottish economy.Finance spokesman Murdo Fraser said it was an \"omnishambles budget\" which would see people pay more for fewer services.The Tories have also accused Mr Mackay of breaking promises to voters not to bring in a tourist tax or raise council taxes by more than 3%.Labour's James Kelly said the SNP was \"kidding itself on\" if it thought there wouldn't be cuts to council services, saying: \"The reality of this budget it that you've got cuts, cuts and cuts all over the country.\"And Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the Greens had been \"bought very cheaply\", and said his party could not back a budget which the government was using as a \"stepping stone\" to independence.","117":"The propulsion of senator and lawyer Kamala Harris to front-runner status among the Democrats hoping to take on President Donald Trump in 2020 has underlined the resurgent political power of her home state.A California senator is one of the front-runners for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. A California congresswoman is Speaker of the House of Representatives. California's new governor is a young, progressive champion promising to offer an alternative to the \"corruption and incompetence\" of Donald Trump's White House.The so-called Golden State has become solidly Democrat blue, and its politicians are flexing their muscles on the national stage. But this golden opportunity doesn't come without risk for the progressive cause.A campaign kick-off is a political show of force. It's a chance to demonstrate that a candidate's appeal exists beyond op-ed think-pieces, lines on a fund-raising report or clicks on a social media post. Nothing drives home the potential of ballot-box success quite like a throng of faces in a cheering crowd.On a warm Sunday afternoon at a public square in Oakland, California, Kamala Harris made just such a statement, packing in an estimated 20,000 people as she officially launched her presidential bid.\"These are not ordinary times, and this is not an ordinary election, but this is our America,\" the California senator said. \"At stake is not the leadership of our party and our country. It is the right to moral leadership of this planet.\" Her speech, carried live on US cable news networks, was geared towards a national audience, including promises of universal healthcare and pre-kindergarten childcare, debt-free college, a working- and middle-class tax cut, and an immigration system that welcomes refugees and provides some undocumented migrants a pathway to citizenship. The choice of this northern California city across the bay from San Francisco to launch her campaign, however, was no accident for the woman just two years into her first term in Washington. It's where Ms Harris, the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, was born. It's also where she first held public office, as a deputy district attorney. Oakland, she notes, is where she stood before a judge as a prosecutor for the first time and said \"five words that would guide my life\" - \"Kamala Harris, for the people\". It's a line she has now adopted as her campaign slogan.Ms Harris would go on to rise through the ranks, first as San Francisco district attorney and then California attorney general, before making the leap to the Senate. \"It's exciting to see someone from California, from the Bay area, run for president,\" says Danny Marquis, a dentist from San Francisco who brought her 11-year-old son, Gabe, to the event.\"She represents some of my values, somebody who's hardy, who has been out there and who has walked the walk that I'm on right now, who will fight for and represent people like me.\"Ajay Bhutoria, a Fremont, California, business consultant who served on the national finance committee for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, says the turnout on Sunday shows just how desperate people are for change.\"California is the leader in innovation, and they're sending a message today,\" he says. Bhutoria adds that while he's still keeping an open mind over whom he will support, Ms Harris is a \"great candidate\". The senator's potential was being heralded on the national level even before Sunday's choreographed launch in front of her hometown fans.Liberal cable news host Rachel Maddow recently said Ms Harris had a \"good chance\" of being the 2020 Democratic nominee. An analysis on the election forecasting site fivethirtyeight.com said she \"comes out looking stronger than any other potential candidate\". New York Times columnist David Leonhardt wrote a piece titled, simply, \"Kamala Harris, a front-runner\".Given the size of the field - and the fact that the first nominating contest is more than a year away - these kinds of predictions are risky. At this point in 2015, many Republicans were busy fitting Jeb Bush with their party's crown, after all.The conventional consensus, however, is that Ms Harris is at the head of the pack - and California is a big reason why.The state is a fund-raising power base with little parallel. In the 24 hours after Ms Harris announced, she reported $1.5m (\u00a31.1m) in donations, breaking a record set by Senator Bernie Sanders in 2016. Last year her campaign committee and related fund-raising organisations brought in more than $23m, with six-figure contributions from individuals associated with entertainment giant WarnerMedia, the University of California, Los Angeles based Creative Artists Agency and the parent company of Bay area tech giant Google.California's primary also has an influential spot in the 2020 calendar, having moved from June in 2016 to early March. If Ms Harris can stay in the race that long - and it certainly seems she will have the money to do it - the senator could be poised to reap the mother lode of Democratic convention delegates in her home state.Of course, being near the top will also make her a lightning-rod for attacks from opponents. While she emphasised her prosecutorial background in her opening speech, she's drawn fire for her handling of crime-lab misconduct while the San Francisco district attorney. She has also been criticised from the left for what some see as an insufficient support of criminal justice reform while she was California attorney general.Her relationship in the mid-1990s with then-speaker of the state assembly Willie Brown, who was married and 30 years her elder, may also become a target. Mr Brown went on to become mayor of San Francisco and has said his influence may have helped Ms Harris win her district attorney job and get her appointments to state commissions.A longtime Harris aide was recently forced to resign amid sexual harassment allegations after reports that California paid a $400,000 legal settlement dating back to Ms Harris's time as attorney general. In the era of #MeToo, how much Ms Harris knew of his behaviour will surely be questioned.With only two years on the national stage, Ms Harris's campaigning abilities - and record - will be tested in a white-hot crucible. Surviving politics in California as a Democrat is one thing; making it on a national playing field is a challenge only a handful can survive.Ms Harris may be seeking the top prize, but her presidential announcement was only the capstone on a month that thrust the state of California firmly onto the national stage. It began with San Francisco Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi returning as Speaker of the House of Representatives after eight years in the political wilderness.It wouldn't take long to demonstrate just how much power the San Franciscan now wields, as she faced down the president in the 35-day battle over border-wall funding and the resulting government shutdown.In November Democrats picked up 40 seats in the chamber - seven from California alone, primarily in what was long thought to be the solidly conservative Los Angeles suburbs of Orange County. Mr Trump's unpopularity in California essentially eviscerated the state's pro-business, socially moderate Republican Party in the land that once helped vault Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan to presidential success.\"There was an old Reagan quote that 'I'm from the government, and I'm here to help' were the scariest words,\" says Bill Whalen, a fellow at Stanford University's conservative-leaning Hoover Institution. \"Those words don't scare people in California anymore.\"For the first time the largest state in the US both in terms of people and economic muscle speaks almost entirely with one political voice. And the message it's sending stands in stark contrast to the Trump-style conservatism that has dominated the national conversation for the past two years.A few days after Ms Pelosi used her gavel to usher in a Democratic-controlled US House of Representatives, she flew back west to have a front-row seat at the inauguration of California's newly elected governor, Gavin Newsom.Under tents erected to ward off the rain at the state capitol in Sacramento - just over an hour's drive north of the Oakland square where Ms Harris formally started her presidential bid three weeks later - the 51-year-old former California lieutenant governor and mayor of San Francisco had his moment in the spotlight. He used his inaugural address to lash out at the \"corruption and incompetence\" of the White House and position his state as the liberal counterweight to Donald Trump's America.\"The country is watching us,\" he said. \"The world is waiting on us. The future depends on us. And we will seize this moment.\"Outside the tents, Mr Newsom's spirit was contagious.\"California is the resistance to the Trump administration,\" says San Jose schoolteacher Andrea Reyna. \"We're the fifth-largest economy in the world by having strong leaders who are voices for equality, who are voices for freedom. It gives us a privilege and thus a responsibility to take a lead.\"This idea of California's special obligation as a progressive beacon permeated the inaugural proceedings in the state capitol.\"As everybody has been saying, California has been the place where policy experimentation has created amazing results,\" says Jennifer Granholm, the former Michigan governor who now teaches at the University of California - Berkeley and served as master of ceremonies for the inauguration of the state's lieutenant governor. \"This is California's moment to shine.\"It's hard to dispute those claims right now, as California - and the Democrats in power - are riding high. The state has been the engine fuelling the record-breaking US economic expansion, accounting for a fifth of the nation's economic growth since 2010. In 2017 its gross domestic product expanded by 4.7% - more than twice the rate of the US as a whole. Per-capita income is rising faster than any other state, and its government budget is running a multi-billion dollar surplus, giving Mr Newsom flexibility to enact sweeping new social programmes.\"Think of everything Democrats want to do in Washington but can't - universal healthcare, more entitlements, more rules, more regulations - without backlash from an opposition party or the public,\" says Whalen. \"California is really the Democratic dream in that regard, and the Newsom administration is putting that dream to the test.\"In his inaugural address, the newly sworn-in governor did, in fact, talk about dreams, although he styled his progressive priorities as the \"California dream\" - of good jobs, quality education and a comfortable retirement.\"Not to get rich quick or star on the big screen, but to work hard and share in the rewards,\" Mr Newsom said. \"To leave a better future for our kids.\"After the speech, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti - who is contemplating his own presidential campaign - expanded on the governor's thoughts.\"Certainly people dream in other states, but nobody talks about the Missouri dream or the Alabama dream,\" he says. \"This is a unique place that almost the whole world knows, even if they've never been here. They feel California as at once an idea and a place.\"As if to drive home the point that California politics and the Trump administration are headed on an ideological collision course, just a few days after Mr Newsom's inaugural salvo, the president lashed out at the state via Twitter, threatening to withhold disaster relief funds for victims of the state's recent spate of fatal forest fires \"unless they get their act together\".California Democrats dreaming big - and holding their state up as an example to the rest of the US and even the rest of the world - could seem in some ways inevitable. The most formidable state in the US, run by progressives under progressive policies, would appear destined to produce ambitious politicians intent on translating the success of their state into national prominence.This sense of inevitability, however, is a relatively recent development.\"California is a funny place,\" says UCLA lecturer and former Los Angeles Times reporter Jim Newton. \"You don't have to look back very far for it to be fairly reliably Republican. This notion of it being an absolutely rock solid Democratic bastion is a relatively new phenomenon.\"Mr Newsom's inauguration, in fact, marked the first time since the 1870s that two Democrats in a row have occupied the California governor's mansion. Ms Harris is the first California politician to seek the Democratic presidential nomination in a quarter century.Part of the reason for this is generational. Jerry Brown, California's governor for the last eight years, was in his 70s during his second stint in office, after serving two terms in the 1970s and early '80s. He had already run for president three times, in 1976, 1980 and 1992, and his national ambitions were long since dimmed.Dianne Feinstein, the state's senior senator, is in her 80s, and Ms Harris predecessor, Barbara Boxer, never showed interest in a White House bid.With a new cadre of Democrats taking the reins comes new ambitions.It's more than that, however. For long stretches over the past three decades, California has been an economic basket case. The state was devastated by the recession of the early 1990s, the tech bubble collapse of 2002 and the Great Recession in 2008.\"In 2010, the conventional wisdom was that California was headed the way of Greece; that it was ungovernable\" says Newton. \"People were openly debating the question of what would happen if a state the size of California declared bankruptcy. It was called, quite literally, a failed state.\"Part of the reason California suffers so grievously in times of economic downturn is because the state is heavily dependent on income and corporate taxes as a revenue stream. When people and corporations make less money, once bursting government coffers quickly go empty.And so while California Democrats are touting the opportunities that California can present as a model of progressive success, the flip side of this opportunity is danger. If California fails - if it slips back into an economic morass - it will quickly become a conservative cautionary tale instead of a liberal beacon. In a front row at Mr Newsom's inauguration, like a ghost of presidential ambitions past, was a man who provides a telling example of just how quickly California fortunes can change.Democrat Gray Davis was elected governor of California in 1998, breaking a Republican hold on the job that stretched back to the end of Mr Brown's first stint in 1982. The Golden State was booming, and government spending shot up. The milquetoast Davis was even being bandied about as a future presidential contender. Shortly after Mr Davis's 2002 re-election, however, the dotcom collapse eviscerated California's economy. Revenues plummeted, and Mr Davis' attempts to raise state fees to compensate led to a voter rebellion that ended in his 2003 recall election and replacement by actor-turned-Republican-politician Arnold Schwarzenegger.After Mr Newsom gave his speech, Mr Davis reflected on his experience.\"Recessions can take a $15 or $20bn surplus and make it a $15 or $20bn deficit,\" he says. \"I think [Mr Newsom] appreciates all the hard work and tough decisions that led to this phenomenal surplus, and I don't think he wants to be the person who squanders that.\"Already there are some dark linings to the silver clouds of Californian prosperity. Profits - and stock valuations - for high-profile Silicon Valley companies like Apple, Facebook and Tesla are down. Property values, which have been skyrocketing, are starting to soften. And in major metropolitan areas where they aren't, working-class families have long since been priced out of desirable homes and neighbourhoods. While the state leads the way in economic growth, it is also tied with Louisiana and Florida for the highest poverty rate in the US, at 19%. More than 130,000 Californians are homeless, with Los Angeles second only to New York City among US cities.\"It's a complicated story,\" says Whalen. \"I can take you to parts of California, and you will fall in love with it. But there are problems with the blue paradise, as well.\"If the economy falters, the problems that Whalen suggests - homelessness, a lack of adequate healthcare, overcrowding and traffic in the cities, and an uneven quality of public education - will get worse as the money dries up.  The progressive challenge over the coming months will be to find a way to enact their priorities on healthcare, the environment, education and immigration while insulating the state from the business cycle's inevitable downturn.Their success or failure will clearly impact upon the national ambitions of men like Mr Newsom and Mr Garcetti, but even Ms Harris - whose presidential campaign will try to cast a broader net - could be tarnished.Already the senator is taking heat for her time as the state's attorney general and a San Francisco city prosecutor, during which critics say was she was not sufficiently supportive of criminal justice reform. If the Democratic regime in California, of which she was recently a part, oversees a budgetary train wreck in the coming year, it will be difficult for her campaign to emerge unscathed.Whalen doesn't think Democrats are up to the task. UCLA's Newton, on the other hand, sees this as the party's biggest challenge - and opportunity.\"There's going to be a downturn, and how Newsom handles that really will help send the message of whether this state is something different or just better than most at riding an upward business cycle,\" he says.And even if the things stay stable, the cadres of ambitious California Democrats - including Ms Harris, Mr Garcetti, Mr Newsom, and others - will have to prove that their state really is a model that can be applied to the nation as a whole.\"For this state to be meaningful beyond electing liberal leaders,\" Newton says, \"it has to show that there is something qualitatively different about what it's like to live under this government than it is under a Trump government. \"If this is a state that can manage wealth, that can handle downturns, it can balance economic growth and environmental protection, that can be welcoming to immigrants at a time when the rest of the country is unsure of that, that's a genuine counterproposal.\"In the days and months ahead, this progressive counterproposal will be put to the test - in California and among Democratic primary voters across the US.Follow Anthony on Twitter.","118":"MSPs have voted to approve the Scottish government's income tax plans for the coming year.Finance Secretary Derek Mackay chose not to pass on a tax cut given to higher earners elsewhere in the UK.This gives the government extra money to spend but means the gap between the Scottish income tax regime and that in the rest of the UK continues to grow.The move was signed off at Holyrood by a vote of 61 to 52, with the six Green members abstaining.Mr Mackay signed off a deal with the Greens to ensure the budget passes at all stages, with the final votes in the chamber on Thursday.Scotland has a five-band income tax system, which sees lower earners pay slightly less in tax than those elsewhere in the UK, while higher earners pay more.Only minimal changes are being made for 2019-20 - most of the rates thresholds are to rise with inflation, but the higher rate threshold has been frozen at \u00a343,430.Because the higher rate threshold in the rest of the UK is rising to \u00a350,000, this means the gap between what higher earners north and south of the border are taxed will grow.Finance minister Kate Forbes told MSPs that the majority of Scottish taxpayers would pay less than counterparts south of the border.She said: \"A cornerstone of the Scottish government approach to taxation is certainty, and in 2019-20 we will not increase any of the rates of income tax.\"This will ensure that 55% of Scottish taxpayers continue to pay less than they would if they lived elsewhere in the UK.\"The Scottish Greens will vote with the SNP to pass Mr Mackay's spending plans on Thursday, although they abstained in the rate resolution vote.Co-convener Patrick Harvie said: \"We don't believe that it goes far enough, but we're not willing to put at risk the wider achievements we've made on amendments to the budget, which would fall if this rate resolution falls.\"All of Holyrood's other parties were critical of the government's plans, and voted against the rates resolution.Scottish Conservative finance spokesman Murdo Fraser accused the SNP of breaking manifesto pledges.Labour's James Kelly said the budget would offer a tax cut to chief executives while local councils are facing cuts.And Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie argued for a \"modest\" tax rise to raise extra funds for education.","119":"The Ministry of Defence has a funding black hole of at least \u00a37bn in its 10-year plan to equip the UK's armed forces, according to a report by the Commons spending watchdog.The Public Accounts Committee said the MoD lacked the ability to \"accurately cost programmes\" and that the shortfall could reach \u00a314.8bn by 2028.MPs added the government did not have a \"coherent and credible\" funding plan.The MoD said it was \"addressing the financial challenges\" it is facing.A spokesman for the department added: \"We are confident that we will deliver the equipment plan within budget this year, as we did last year, as we strive to ensure our military have the very best ships, aircraft and vehicles.\"The MoD plans to spend more than \u00a3180bn on new warships, submarines, jets and armoured vehicles over the next decade.But the PAC's chairwoman, Labour MP Meg Hillier, said the department was \"a repeat offender\" when it came to \"poor financial planning\".She added that progress in addressing concerns raised by the committee in May 2018 had been \"woeful\". Ms Hillier told the BBC's Today programme: \"There's a very big funding gap in what the Ministry of Defence says it wants to do and the money available. If they don't plug that gap there's going to be ongoing problems.\"Asked if the MoD was always facing funding difficulties, Ms Hiller said: \"It does feel a bit like Groundhog Day. There just needs to be a clear decision about what the priorities are.\"Any indecision or any delay has a huge knock-on effect. Small delays can cost millions, if not billions, of pounds.\"Lord Dannatt, a former head of the Army, told the programme the defence secretary had \"a very strong case to make\" for increasing the military budget.A defence and security review that followed the 2010 general election had \"slashed and burned a lot of our capabilities\", he said.\"The Americans wring their hands now and say that we're not the reliable allies that we were because we haven't got the fully rounded capabilities.\"You can't have a nation like ours' defence on the cheap. Two per cent of GDP is the lowest we've ever spent on our defence since the second world war, and it's bought us the smallest army, navy and air force we've ever had.\"In its report, the PAC demanded more information on the risks associated with major projects, including the purchase of F-35 stealth jets and Type 31e frigates.Part of the problem, the committee said, was that the government had dithered over which projects to fully finance and which to cancel or scale back.","120":"Sub-prime lender Non-Standard Finance (NSF) has made a \u00a31.3bn takeover offer for rival Provident Financial.NSF boss John van Kuffeler was previously chief executive and chairman of Provident, a doorstep lender with a history of financial troubles.He said the deal would \"create a market leader in non-standard finance\".NSF said the takeover was backed by more than 50% of Provident's shareholders, including fund manager Neil Woodford, Invesco and Marathon.Investors must still vote on whether to approve the deal.Provident has seen its shares plunge after profit warnings and the resignation of a former chief executive.In January, it warned again that profits would be below analysts' expectations. The group said it had seen a rise in bad debts at its Vanquis Bank arm and falling numbers of new accounts after clamping down on its lending.Under the terms of the offer, Provident shareholders would get 8.88 new NSF shares for each Provident share. Based on NSF's closing share price of 58p on Thursday, the tie-up values Provident at \u00a31.3bn, or 511p per share.It is the second time NSF has approached Provident.Mr van Kuffeler said: \"We have recognised the strong logic and value creation potential of a combination with Provident for some time and hence approached the Provident board with a proposal in January last year. That approach was rebuffed and since then Provident has further lost its way.\"However, NSF has extensive management expertise and experience, and the correct strategy to turn Provident around and release significant value by combining it with our own fast-growing businesses for the benefit of customers, employees and investors.\"Provident is also recovering from a string of regulatory sanctions.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) fined Vanquis \u00a32m and ordered it to pay \u00a3168.8m in compensation for failing to disclose charges of its popular repayment option plan.Meanwhile, its Moneybarn car loan arm is under investigation by the FCA over how it treats borrowers who fall behind with payments.","121":"German prosecutors are investigating more than 100 threatening emails sent to politicians, lawyers, a pop singer and others, apparently from neo-Nazis.The anonymous emails are signed \"National-Socialist Offensive\", \"NSU 2.0\" or \"Wehrmacht\" - suggesting one or more neo-Nazis sent them.Left-wing MP Martina Renner and pop singer Helene Fischer were targeted.The language of the emails is similar. Some were bomb threats, which prompted police searches in two cities.Those threats triggered evacuations of the main railway station in L\u00fcbeck on Monday and of the public finance offices in Gelsenkirchen on Tuesday, but no bombs were found, German media report.Last September Helene Fischer condemned far-right hate speech at a concert in Chemnitz, soon after far-right groups had marched in the eastern city and clashed with police there.Read more on related topics:The German daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung reports that MP Martina Renner of left-wing party Die Linke received an email on Tuesday that threatened letter bombs and \"executions in the street\", and was signed \"National-Socialist Offensive\".National Socialism was the ideology of Adolf Hitler, whose army in World War Two was called the Wehrmacht. \"NSU 2.0\" refers to the outlawed National Socialist Underground, a neo-Nazi terror group found to have committed 10 racially-motivated murders.The only surviving member of an NSU cell, Beate Zsch\u00e4pe, was found guilty in that murder case last July.Many of the threatening emails were apparently posted in Berlin, so the investigation is being led by Berlin state prosecutors. Threats of violence can be prosecuted under laws against incitement, blackmail or disturbance of the peace.Among those who received bomb threats were Germany's Central Council of Jews, high courts in Bamberg and Munich, the chief prosecutor's office in Frankfurt and Hamburg airport.","122":"The chairman of NHS Highland has resigned, the Scottish government has said.David Alston was appointed to the role in 2015 and took over from Garry Coutts in March the following year.Before his appointment, Mr Alston had been a long-serving Highland councillor.Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has appointed Prof Boyd Robertson, a former principal of Skye's Sabhal M\u00f2r Ostaig Gaelic college, as interim chairman.In a statement, Mr Alston said it had been a \"privilege\" to serve an \"incredible\" health board first as a non-executive director and then as its chairman.NHS Highland has also announced that Dr Rod Harvey is step down from his position of board medical director and take retirement with effect from the 31 August. By the time of his retirement Dr Harvey will have worked continuously in the NHS for 37 years, the health board said.NHS Highland covers a large area, including the Highlands, Skye and parts of Argyll. Its hospitals include Raigmore in Inverness and the Belford in Fort William.It has faced challenges in recent months.Allegations of a \"bullying culture\" are being investigated by a QC-led independent review, and the health board has had to deal with projected deficit of \u00a319.9m for 2018\/19.Ms Freeman said Prof Robertson would work alongside NHS Highland's chief executive Iain Stewart, who was appointed in January.She said: \"This is a critical leadership role and Prof Robertson has extensive experience in Scotland's public life, including senior leadership roles.\"It is vital that NHS Highland, under the direction of Prof Robertson and Iain Stewart, moves forward at pace addressing the known priority areas of improvement required including finance and service delivery and embracing fully the work needed from John Sturrock QC's review when finalised.\"Ms Freeman added: \"The priority, as always across NHS Scotland, is safe and effective patient care, and I am confident that under their leadership, people across the Highlands will receive the excellent level of service they deserve.\"Mr Alston, who first joined NHS Highland as a non-executive director in 2003, said: \"I am immensely grateful to all of the team here at NHS Highland. \"It has been my privilege to serve as a director of this incredible health board since 2003 and as its chair since 2016.  \"Throughout my time with NHS Highland, we have seen many changes and have overcome many challenges.  However, the need for change continues and is probably now greater than ever.\" On behalf of NHS Highland's board, Mr Stewart thanked Mr Alston for his \"many years of dedicated service\".Kate Forbes, SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, also thanked Mr Alston for his service.She said Prof Robertson was a \"brilliant\" appointment and that he was respected by many in Highlands.","123":"The owner of a US gossip magazine accused of blackmail by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says that it acted in good faith but will conduct an inquiry.American Media Inc (AMI), the National Enquirer's parent company, also says it believes it acted lawfully in its reporting on the world's richest man.Mr Bezos accused AMI of trying to blackmail him over intimate photos.He said the company had wanted him to stop investigating how they had obtained his private messages.Hours after Mr Bezos announced his divorce last month, the magazine had published details, including private messages, of an extramarital affair.In a stunning blog post on Thursday, he posted an email he said had been sent to his intermediaries by AMI lawyer Jon Fine threatening to publish photos of him and his lover, former TV host Lauren Sanchez.\"Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail,\" wrote Mr Bezos, \"I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten.\"The billionaire, who also owns the liberal Washington Post newspaper, said AMI had wanted him to make a \"false public statement\" that the National Enquirer's coverage of him and his mistress was not politically motivated.Mr Bezos included an email in which, according to Mr Bezos, Mr Fine proposed on Wednesday that the photos would not be published in return for a public statement \"affirming that [Mr Bezos and his team] have no knowledge or basis\" to suspect such a motive. Mr Bezos' own investigator had, he claimed, suggested earlier that there were indeed \"strong leads\" to suspect political reasons.In his blog post, Mr Bezos mentioned AMI's links to President Donald Trump.It said the company believed \"fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr Bezos\".AMI said that it had been \"in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him\" when the allegations were made, and that its board had \"convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims\".He said his ownership of the Washington Post was a \"complexifier\" for him because he had made enemies of \"certain powerful people\", including President Trump, who is a friend of AMI's boss, David Pecker.AMI recently admitted in court that it had co-ordinated with the Trump presidential campaign to pay a Playboy model $150,000 (\u00a3115,000) in hush money to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Mr Trump.Mr Bezos noted in his blog post how the publisher had confessed to a \"catch and kill\" deal to bury Karen McDougal's politically embarrassing story.AMI's agreement to co-operate with federal authorities means it will not face criminal charges over the payments, Manhattan prosecutors announced in December.But US media on Friday quoted federal prosecutors as saying they were now investigating whether AMI had broken this deal in light of the emails Mr Bezos had published, although no further details were given.Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen - who facilitated the hush money at the direction, he says, of Mr Trump - has already admitted violating campaign finance laws.A judge confirmed in a court filing on Thursday that federal prosecutors in New York were still investigating campaign finance crimes committed when Cohen paid two women to stay silent about alleged affairs with Trump before he became president.  \"Of course I don't want personal photos published,\" Mr Bezos wrote in his blog post before adding: \"I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\"His blog contained itemised details of 10 pictures in an email from National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, who said they had been \"obtained during our newsgathering\". Dylan Howard's name, along with those of two National Enquirer reporters, appeared on an 11-page story the magazine published on 9 January containing alleged details of Mr Bezos' affair with Ms Sanchez. The tabloid labelled it \"the biggest investigation in Enquirer history\".This has been the focus of Mr Bezos' private investigators. The inquiry has been led by Gavin de Becker, who is the billionaire's long-term head of security.Last week he said Lauren Sanchez's brother, Michael, had become one of the focuses of their investigation. Mr Sanchez, a publicist who lives in West Hollywood, has strongly rejected involvement.\"I am not dignifying de Becker's passive aggressive allegations or his crazy conspiracy theories,\" he said in a statement to Page Six. He also said he had recommended his sister fire Mr de Becker. US media report that Mr Sanchez knows AMI's David Pecker - as well as other people with links to Mr Trump including his former campaign aides Carter Page and Roger Stone. Mr Stone was indicted by the special counsel's Russia investigation last month. He has confirmed to the Daily Beast that he knows Mr Sanchez - describing him as a \"very good guy\". ","124":"Thousands of people who invested in a high-risk bond scheme marketed as a \"Fixed Rate ISA\" fear they have lost everything after the company collapsed.London Capital & Finance (LCF), now in administration, took \u00a3236m following a marketing campaign that is now under investigation for mis-selling.Many were first-time investors - inheritance recipients, small business owners or newly retired.Administrators said investors could get as little as 20% of their money back.Peter Thornley and his wife retired to Devon after a teaching career. He now fears he may have to return to work if their money is lost.\"It put us under a lot of pressure - socially and emotionally. It makes you feel really foolish,\" he said. \"There is a group of us bondholders; there are about 900 in ours.\"We have all got money that we have been left by parents or a lump we got on retirement, then all of a sudden 35 years of savings has gone in a couple of months.\"John Wright, a retired joiner from Northampton, was recovering from heart surgery when he found out LCF was in administration.\"This was money for our grandchildren, we weren't going on fancy holidays or buying flash cars - my wife worked in BHS and saved her whole life, this is hard-earned money, we saved and saved and saved.\"I am devastated, I feel a complete fool. I was completely taken in by the marketing.\"LCF paid an agent, Brighton-based Surge PLC, 25% commission - which amounted to \u00a360m - to run the marketing campaign.A series of web adverts promising 8% returns from secure ISAs were released and in addition a comparison website - run by a company with links to Surge - would compare the 1% and 2% return ISAs from high street banks with the investments at LCF.LCF was authorised by regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - but the FCA said the authorisation was to provide consumer financial advice, not the sale of bonds or ISAs.The FCA subsequently ordered the advertisements should stop running.In a letter to bondholders administrator Finbarr O'Connell said once the \u00a360m to Surge was paid, returns of up to 44% would be required in order for LCF to make good on its promises.Investors were told the funds - and therefore risk - would be spread across hundreds of companies but, according to Companies House records, LCF loaned money to 12 - four of which have never filed accounts, nine are fewer than three years old, and nine had loans from LCF in 2017.Much of the cash was loaned to companies that then \"sub loaned\" to others. Bondholders have raised concerns about connections between the directors of companies that received money and those who ran LCF.Michael Andrew Thomson, known as Andy Thomson, took over as the boss of LCF in 2015 and is also director of horse riding company GT Eventing.Paul Careless is the majority shareholder of both Surge PLC and RPDigitalServices - the company that powered ISA comparison websites.Christine Anderson put thousands of pounds into LCF. She runs her own business, a surf school in Devon.\"They have done very well out of hard-working people - a lot have put some or all of their savings into this company,\" she said.\"The directors and ex-directors are living the life of Riley from what I can see, with their helicopters, their horses and their properties. \"It is very sad that this could have been allowed to happen.\"In December the FCA froze LCF's activities, pulled the adverts and in January found that LCF had \"made communications in relation to its fixed rate ISA or bond which were misleading, not fair and not clear\". The FCA findings included that LCF's bonds did not qualify to be held in an ISA account and therefore investors were being misled by being told the interest they earned would be tax free.The FCA said it was \"unlikely\" investors would be protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) but it was \"for the FSCS to determine\".Independent financial adviser Neil Liversidge wrote to the FCA in 2015 warning it about the scheme.Mr Liversidge said: \"The way it was promoted, a great many people could have fallen for this.\"A client brought it to us but when we looked into it there was a lot of interconnection between the people they were lending to and the management of LCF themselves. \"We warned our clients off and the same day we wrote to the regulator raising our concerns about the promotion.\"Ms Anderson said: \"We feel let down - we trusted this company because they had been regulated and authorised - we then found that they weren't even allowed to manage ISAs.\"The FCA should have known that before they allowed us to buy these products.\"A spokesman for Surge Financial said: \"Surge has a number of clients and its fees for LCF are in line with the industry standard.\"LCF was an FCA regulated business and it signed off all marketing materials and financial promotions prior to publication as required by the Financial Services and Markets Act.  \"Surge was a supplier of services used in relation to raising investment for LCF. It did not handle client money and had no involvement in the deployment of funds to borrowing companies.\"Mr Thomson has not responded to BBC requests for comment.The FCA said it could not comment further.There will be more on this story on Moneybox on BBC Radio Four at 12:00 GMT on Saturday 9 March and on Inside Out on BBC One in the South West of England at 20:30 GMT on Monday 11 March, and afterwards on the iPlayer.","125":"Berlin's public transport authority BVG is offering women a 21% discount on fares in the capital to mark Germany's Equal Pay Day. BVG says the aim is to draw attention to the average 21% pay gap between men and women in Germany - one of the biggest gender pay gaps in the EU.According to EU data for 2016, the gap is greatest in Estonia (25.6%) and smallest in Romania (just over 5%). The UK gap is about 21%.The gap is 16% on average in the EU.The European Commission highlights three broad disadvantages that women face: Explaining the women's \"Frauenticket\" scheme, only valid for Monday, BVG said the 21% gap was equivalent to 77 days of unpaid work for women. And 18 March - Equal Pay Day - is day 77 since the start of the year.A normal \u20ac7 (\u00a36; $8) BVG day ticket has been reduced to \u20ac5.50 for women.BVG says it provides equal pay for women and men in all its job categories and is seeking to make women 27% of its workforce, from the current 20%.Read more on similar topics:Germany's Federal Employment Agency (BA) gives examples of the gender pay gap in several professions: The EU compares average pay across the 28-nation bloc by looking at gross hourly earnings for men and women in enterprises with 10 or more employees, in both the public and private sector.The gender pay gap in finance and insurance is higher than in the business economy as a whole, the EU's statistics agency Eurostat reports.In general, the male-female pay gap tends to be much lower for younger employees - it widens with age.In most EU countries the gaps are wider in the private sector than in the public sector.","126":"The Help to Buy housing scheme, launched in 2013, is hailed by the government as one of its big successes.The Treasury says 494,108 English homes have been bought through the scheme, with the vast majority going to first-time buyers living outside London.Ministers and mortgage lenders alike say it lifts people into home ownership by getting them on the housing ladder.But critics say it merely subsidises housebuilders and pushes up the price of new homes.Similar schemes exist in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There are two main forms: Help to Buy loans and Help to Buy Individual Savings Accounts (Isas).In the first version, the government lends up to 20% of the cost of a newly built property - or 40% within Greater London - so buyers need only a 5% deposit and a 75% mortgage to buy it.Those purchasing a new-build home are not charged interest for the first five years. The Help to Buy Isa was launched later, in December 2015, and is open to first-time buyers in the UK. Savers receive a 25% bonus from the government when they withdraw the money they have saved to buy their first property. The maximum purchase price is \u00a3250,000, or \u00a3450,000 in London. The maximum government bonus that someone can receive is \u00a33,000, if they have saved \u00a312,000.Savers can deposit up to \u00a3200 a month, although they can kick-start saving with a lump sum of \u00a31,200. Chancellor Philip Hammond is certainly firmly behind the scheme, which was introduced by his predecessor, George Osborne.He has extended it to run until March 2023 and says the move will support \"half a million more home purchases\".He said: \"The government supports those who dream of owning their own home and wants to help them take the first step on to the property ladder.\"Support also comes from the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association. Its executive director, Kate Davies, said Help to Buy had become \"a cornerstone of the UK property market\" and provides \"essential support to the whole of the UK property sector\".She added: \"Although last year saw the highest number of first-time buyers since the financial crisis, millions of households are still waiting to get on the housing ladder and Help to Buy will continue to play a crucial role in helping some of these households into home ownership over the next four years.\"The argument against the scheme has gained ground this week, with the news that one of the UK's biggest builders of houses, Persimmon, saw its annual profits top \u00a31bn last year.A day earlier, the firm's share price fell 5% because of suggestions that its participation in Help to Buy was under government scrutiny.For opponents of the scheme, that just shows how dependent the firm has become on big injections of public cash.Mike Amey, managing director of global investment management firm Pimco, told the BBC that profit on a house sold by Persimmon had trebled since Help to Buy was introduced, \"roughly from \u00a320,000 to \u00a360,000\".And property expert Henry Pryor told the BBC that last year, half the number of homes Persimmon built were underpinned by support from Help to Buy.Mr Pryor said the scheme was brought in for legitimate reasons following the credit crunch, to restore confidence in the sector.But since then, it had become \"the crack cocaine of the building industry\", he said.\"When we are weaned off it, it is going to be painful,\" he added.Other big housebuilders, such as Barratt and Taylor Wimpey, are thought to have benefited to a similar extent.Well, it has arguably distorted the housing market by making it more advantageous to buy a new-build home than an existing one.Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley in 2017 said the price gap between new homes and second-hand ones had set a new record.\"There has always been a small premium for new-build; people will pay extra for spanking-new kitchens and bathrooms. But since 2013, that premium has rocketed,\" it said.For Mark Dyason, managing director of specialist property broker Thistle Finance, Help to Buy could come to a sticky end when the scheme is finally wound up.He said: \"Help to Buy is in much the same vein as low [interest] rates since the global financial crisis.\"They have kept the economy going, but equally they have kicked the can down the road.\"The Help to Buy scheme is arguably a hollow victory, with the potential to cause all manner of problems, both for the buyers who have used it and the developers that have offered it.\""}}
