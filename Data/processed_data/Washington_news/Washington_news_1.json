Democrats\u2019 far-reaching document request seeking information from President Trump\u2019s sons, his business associates and his political confidants opened a sprawling investigation Monday and cast a spotlight on the ambitious strategy of the committee with the authority to impeach a president. The House Judiciary Committee sent more than 80 letters demanding all communications from a host of controversies surrounding Trump, as the panel probes whether the president and his administration have engaged in obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power. But rather than a targeted approach, Monday\u2019s request was broad, reaching current and former campaign staffers, top Trump Organization officials, even documents and communications of the National Rifle Association and the British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The inquiry touched on a wide array of matters, from the president\u2019s business dealings with Russia to the firing of former FBI director James B. Comey to hush payments made to women. Many of those issues are already being examined by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York \u2014 not to mention other committees in the House. \u201cWe will act quickly to gather this information, assess the evidence, and follow the facts where they lead with full transparency with the American people,\u201d House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \u201cThis is a critical time for our nation, and we have a responsibility to investigate these matters and hold hearings for the public to have all the facts. That is exactly what we intend to do.\u201d The extensive scope could bolster claims by Trump and Republicans that congressional Democrats are seeking to undermine the president and cripple his 2020 reelection effort rather than conduct a disciplined, fact-finding inquiry. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders criticized the new probe in a statement, saying, \u201cToday, Chairman Nadler opened up a disgraceful and abusive investigation into tired, false allegations already investigated by the Special Counsel and committees in both Chambers of Congress.\u201d At an event at the White House with the North Dakota State University championship football team, Trump was asked if he plans to cooperate. \u201cI cooperate all the time with everybody,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cYou know the beautiful thing \u2014 no collusion. It\u2019s all a hoax.\u201d The president also spent the day retweeting his supporters who criticized the document request as \u201cridiculous\u201d or called Democrats \u201csore losers\u201d in the 2016 election. The vast range of the request raised the specter of unfocused inquiries that could last years and involve multiple committees competing for witnesses and documents. \u201cThe scope of the Democrats\u2019 race to find something bad on this president is getting more and more concerning. .\u2009.\u2009. Where are they willing to stop? I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re trying to do or where they\u2019re trying to go,\u201d said Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee. At the White House, Trump and his aides vowed publicly to cooperate with the congressional oversight and review the request from Nadler. Privately, however, advisers dismissed the request as clear overreach and were preparing to push back against the committee\u2019s demands. One aide described Nadler\u2019s request as a political ploy orchestrated to cover ground that already has been trod by other investigations, including Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian election interference. The White House has been preparing for aggressive congressional oversight for several months, adding more than a dozen lawyers, including some with experience working for congressional Republicans, to the White House Counsel\u2019s Office this year. The Trump team\u2019s emerging strategy, which is being overseen by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone \u2014 with input from White House lawyer Emmet Flood, who has been leading the White House\u2019s response to the Mueller investigation \u2014 is to focus on limiting the scope of investigations and preserving legal protections for the president. The strategy includes asserting executive privilege whenever White House lawyers feel it is necessary to preserve confidentiality, but their first instinct is to be cooperative in responding to requests when warranted, according to people with knowledge of internal discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Democrats, meanwhile, say they\u2019re ready to subpoena the information if needed, all but ensuring an intergovernmental clash in the coming weeks. Recipients \u2014 be they individuals, companies or government agencies \u2014 have two weeks to comply with the requests. Should they fail to do so, the panel will compel the information forcefully, a committee lawyer told reporters on a call Monday morning. For months, House Democrats said they would look to Mueller\u2019s findings to determine whether to proceed with impeachment hearings. But Nadler\u2019s request demonstrates that Democrats are preparing to probe well beyond Russia\u2019s interference in the election. Those receiving letters from the House Judiciary Committee include the president\u2019s two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; his former personal secretary and senior vice president of the Trump Organization, Rhona Graff; Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization; and former top White House aides Hope Hicks, Sean Spicer and Stephen K. Bannon. Other demands for documents have been directed to institutions including the White House, the Justice Department, the Trump campaign, the Trump presidential transition team and the Trump Organization. Nadler has said that the FBI probe is but a piece of Democrats\u2019 oversight puzzle. And Judiciary Committee staff members said the requests underscored lawmakers\u2019 determination to hold Trump and those around him accountable for an array of controversies that have dogged the president during his first two years in office \u2014 and perhaps lay the grounds for impeachment proceedings. Dismissing criticism, Nadler told CNN, \u201cWe\u2019re simply exercising our oversight jurisdiction.\u201d Still, the missives raised questions about the scope of Democrats\u2019 inquiry, as well as which Democratic-led committees would be charged with investigating which controversies. About half a dozen House committees are probing Trump in some capacity. But while the chairmen meet regularly and have tried to pick lanes, they keep bumping into one another, overlap that could create problems in the future. Hours after Nadler\u2019s letters went public, for example, the chairmen of three committees asked acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for any documents on Trump\u2019s interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Nadler\u2019s inquiries sought the same information. A former assistant counsel on the Watergate investigation, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly, said it was tough to discern House Democrats\u2019 strategy given the volume of the information they are seeking. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re looking more to get into a confrontation or whether they\u2019re actually looking for information,\u201d the person said. \u201cThis is a lot of material. .\u2009.\u2009. You have to prioritize and decide what is most important and the best prospects of yielding something that is important and relevant.\u201d The individual added: \u201cHow do they go through all that material and even remember what they are looking for? .\u2009.\u2009. It\u2019s a kitchen-sink kind of request that lawyers tend to use in cases where they know stuff is there, but they\u2019re not quite sure where it is or what it is.\u201d A House Judiciary aide acknowledged overlap among document requests by the various House committees conducting investigations. But panel staff and leaders are huddling regularly to share notes and deconflict, the source said. Over time, the aide said, different committees will take the lead on certain issues. And Judiciary intends to share its document findings with the relevant panels, one committee staffer said. \u201cThe important thing is that the investigations are staying out of each other\u2019s way and we\u2019re also helping each other,\u201d the aide said. Phil Schiliro, who worked under former Oversight and Reform Committee chairman Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) and in President Barack Obama\u2019s White House, said the panel is \u201capproaching it the right way\u201d and \u201cnot getting ahead of the facts.\u201d The sheer number of the scandals encompassing the White House justifies the long list of requests, he argued. \u201cNo Congress \u2014 no group of reporters \u2014 has ever had to deal with something like this before,\u201d he said. The inquiries encompass issues from the campaign\u2019s data operation and Cambridge Analytica to Michael Cohen\u2019s post-election consulting contract with Columbus Nova, a U.S.-based investment vehicle for Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg and others. (The company has said Vekselberg played no role in Cohen\u2019s hiring.) They include requests about well-known episodes, like the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, and far-less-covered incidents, such as a 2016 effort by Peter Smith, a now-deceased Chicago-based Republican fundraiser, to reach out to Russian hackers to get copies of Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails. Inquiries also went out to Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale; former 2016 campaign officials such as Corey Lewandowski; former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus; and former White House counsel Donald McGahn. Nadler also asked American Media Inc. and its chief executive, David Pecker, a longtime Trump ally, about hush payments or \u201cany payment\u201d made by Cohen, then Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, to assist Trump during the campaign. Nadler asked AMI as well about any times in recent years it has had to \u201ccatch and kill\u201d an unflattering story or allegation about Trump \u2014 a term for keeping such a story buried. The committee said Monday\u2019s tranche of requests would not be the last, suggesting that investigations by House Democrats could become broader still with time. For instance, panel staffers expect that Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump will receive a document request in the coming weeks. She did not receive one Monday. Judiciary Committee staff argue that there is a constitutional question about whether the party can hold Trump accountable for any illicit or morally questionable activities he may have committed before he became president.  ","1":"Let\u2019s be real: For millennials, having an emergency fund is way down on the financial worry list, behind student loan debt, medical bills or saving for a down payment. Some weeks, it can feel like you barely have enough money to get by, let alone put some away for a rainy day. But that cash stash can be crucial in preventing a debt spiral or keeping you afloat if you lose your job. Regardless of income, building your emergency fund doesn\u2019t have to be intimidating. START SMALL, BUILD A HABIT First, pick an amount you can put away on a regular basis, no matter how small. Then, commit to it. \u201cIt can be as little as $10 a week into a separate savings account,\u201d says Lara Lamb, a certified financial planner at Abacus Wealth Partners in Los Angeles. Making a small contribution every week is less painful than shooting for an ideal final sum, she says. Automatically transferring the money to a separate account helps you succeed at saving. The saving habit \u2014 even if it\u2019s small \u2014 is valuable for your finances in the long term, says Eric Gabor, a certified financial planner at Eagle Grove Advisors in Jersey City, New Jersey. A family with at least $250 in savings is less likely to face financial turmoil such as a missed utility payment or eviction, according to a 2016 study by the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. Any amount above that \u2014 $400, $500 \u2014 improves your chances of navigating a setback. Getting started is especially important for younger adults. An Urban Institute study released this year found 35.6 percent of adults ages 18-34 surveyed in December 2017 had experienced \u201cfinancial insecurity\u201d in the previous 12 months. That was the highest among the study\u2019s three age groups of adults under 65. It defined financial insecurity as the \u201cinability to come up with a small amount of money to buffer negative economic shocks or to pay his or her credit card or nonmortgage loan.\u201d Lamb suggests working toward one month\u2019s fixed expenses, which includes rent, groceries, transportation and insurance. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about your eating-out money or shopping money,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you are in an emergency or a transition, the whole idea is you would cut back on your spending.\u201d A savings account that pays a high interest rate is a smart place to keep your fund, both planners say, so it can grow. MAKE USE OF WINDFALLS An easy way to kick-start your fund is to use windfalls \u2014 part of a tax refund or even birthday money from relatives. Young professionals typically get tax refunds instead of owing money, Gabor says. The IRS allows you to direct deposit your refund in up to three accounts, so you can send part directly to your emergency fund. If no windfall is imminent, check your checking account. Leave a small buffer so that you aren\u2019t at risk of overdrawing and put anything else in the emergency fund to earn interest, Lamb says. There\u2019s no ideal amount to keep in your checking account. But both financial planners warn that having a lot of extra \u201ccushion\u201d in a checking account carries the temptation to spend it. PLAN FOR NON-EMERGENCIES If you\u2019re building the habit of saving for emergencies, use that muscle to plan for other expenses. Financial experts often use the terms \u201cirregular expenses\u201d and \u201cunplanned expenses.\u201d An unplanned expense is something you don\u2019t foresee, such as an illness or car repair. Irregular expenses are predictable costs that come up during the year \u2014 think of car registration fees or holiday season spending. Ideally, an emergency fund shouldn\u2019t be used for irregular expenses, Lamb says. Instead, build a separate pool of money for them. \u201cSit down and look at last year\u2019s worth of spending and look at the things that popped up periodically,\u201d she says. \u201cThink about the coming year and how that might change. Figure out the annual amount and divide by 12. That dollar amount is what you set aside every month in an irregular expense account.\u201d USE THE MONEY WHEN YOU NEED IT Don\u2019t be afraid to use your emergency fund when you need it. Knowing the difference between unplanned and irregular expenses can help you decide when to tap it. If the alternative is maxing out your credit cards or taking a high-interest loan, it\u2019s cheaper over the long term to use your cash, then immediately start rebuilding the fund. _______________________________________________","2":"Rep.

The arrangement, first reported by conservative outlets, left hidden who ultimately profited from the payments \u2014 a sharp juxtaposition with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s calls for transparency in politics. She has called dark money \u201cthe enemy to democracy.\u201d The money that flowed to her chief of staff\u2019s company have subjected the first-term congresswoman to critics\u2019 charges of hypocrisy. On Monday, a conservative group filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that the PACs failed to properly disclose their spending. David Mitrani, attorney for the PACs, the LLC and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign, said in a statement Tuesday that all four entities \u201cfully complied with the law and the highest ethical standards.\u201d He said that Chakrabarti never received any salary or profit from the company, the PACs or the campaign. \u201cThere is no violation\u201d of campaign finance law, Ocasio-Cortez told Fox News on Tuesday. It is unclear whether she had knowledge of the payments to Chakrabarti\u2019s company. Limited-liability companies, which in some states are not required to disclose details about their owners or spending, have played an increasing role in politics in recent years. Critics say such entities allow both donors and vendors to mask their activities, making it difficult for the public to trace who is giving to campaigns and profiting from them. Brand New Congress LLC, initially called Brand New Campaign LLC, was formed by Chakrabarti to serve as a \u201ccampaign in a box, a one-stop vendor for communications, field, online organizing, fundraising and the like,\u201d Mitrani said in his statement. Among its clients were two PACs \u2014 Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress \u2014 which worked to recruit progressive and nontraditional candidates to run for Congress, he said. Chakrabarti identifies himself as a co-founder of both groups on his LinkedIn page. In 2016 and 2017, the two PACs reported paying the LLC $1.07\u00a0million, records show. Campaign finance experts said the relationship between Chakrabarti\u2019s PACs and the limited-liability company obfuscated who received the payments \u2014 and raised questions about who benefited. \u201cIn a normal situation, if all you saw was a PAC that disbursed hundreds of thousands of dollars to an affiliated entity to pay the salaries of people who were really working for the PAC, that looks like .\u2009.\u2009. a PAC that takes in money to engage in political activity but is actually enriching its owners,\u201d said Adav Noti, former Federal Election Commission lawyer who is now chief of staff of the Campaign Legal Center, a group that advocates for greater transparency in campaign finance. In his statement, Mitrani said that the PACs did not disclose information about the ultimate recipients of the money because they were not required to do so by the FEC. \u201cIf the PACs and campaigns were required to provide additional information on subvendor payments made by Brand New Congress LLC, it would have done so,\u201d he wrote. He provided a January 2017 contract between the Justice Democrats PAC and the LLC showing that the company charged the PAC a monthly retainer fee of $60,000. The fee was to pay employees, subcontractors and agents, according to the contract. The contract shows that the primary consultants for the project were Chakrabarti; Nasim Thompson, then the LLC\u2019s chief operating officer; and Corbin Trent, a consultant who is now a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez. Correction: An earlier version of this story referred to an entity owned by Rep. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.)\u2019s chief of staff as a limited-liability corporation. In fact, it is a limited-liability company.","3":"President Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women; was accused by numerous women of sexual harassment or assault; endorsed a candidate for Senate who was credibly accused of child molestation; praised an aide despite photographic evidence supporting accusations of spousal abuse; directed that hush money be paid to women in advance of the 2016 election (arguably in violation of federal campaign finance laws); and routinely smeared and insulted women. He refused to divest his business properties, leading to widespread conflicts of interest and receipt of potentially unconstitutional emoluments. He repeatedly interfered with an ongoing investigation and was forced to close his foundation after discovery of widespread financial impropriety. Now we learn, through reporting in The Post, about a far-flung operation that sourced and employed illegal immigrants for a Trump property. (Frank Sharry of America\u2019s Voice told me, \u201cLong before Trump shamelessly exploited the fear of undocumented immigrants for political gain, he shamelessly exploited the labor of undocumented immigrants for private profit. The hypocrisy is stunning. The lawlessness seems clear. State and federal investigations into possible labor, trafficking and conspiracy are needed.\u201d) An ordinary business would be under investigation, facing massive fines. And yet, with all that and much more, not a single Republican member of Congress has called for Trump\u2019s impeachment or resignation. None has even demanded he decline to run for reelection. Supposedly respected Republican pundits defend him, vilify Trump critics, abhor congressional oversight and support his reelection. After all, they got their huge tax cuts for the rich and two Supreme Court appointments to their liking. The moral failure and abject irresponsibility of the Republican Party, its donors, its activists and its countless enablers continue to shock and dismay the rest of America. Have these Republicans no standards, no decency? They do not. Contrast that with Democrats\u2019 reaction to their own side\u2019s misconduct in Virginia. Democratic state legislators, House members, both U.S. senators for Virginia and a slew of presidential candidates demanded Gov. Ralph Northam resign after a photograph was made public of a person in blackface and another in a Ku Klu Klan robe and hood on his 1984 medical school yearbook page. When two women came forward with credible, detailed accusations of sexual assault against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, Democratic state officials called for him to resign. Del. Patrick A. Hope (D-Arlington) on Friday declared his intention to introduce articles of impeachment. Republicans, who backed the Senate candidacy of the pro-Confederate Corey A. Stewart, have the temerity to gripe that Democrats\u2019 denunciation of their own official didn\u2019t come fast enough. Democrats should not complain about the glaring double standard. They should embrace it and revel in their own party\u2019s willingness to hold its side to a standard of decency, candor and faithfulness to the law. Democrats could not always claim to be on the side of the angels, but the passage of time and the lessons of the Clinton presidency (not to mention the rising activism and political influence of women and nonwhite voters) have changed their mind-set. Rather than react with \u201cCircle the wagons!\u201d they consider the bigger picture. Do not defend the indefensible. Do not sacrifice long-term reputation for short-term political expediency. The party must stand for something more than the defense of its sleaziest members.  Democrats aren\u2019t saints, to be sure. No party is without hypocrisy or devoid of charlatans. However, at this juncture, there is simply no comparison between the two sides. Commentators suggesting otherwise in the name of \u201cbalance\u201d or \u201cfairness\u201d discredit themselves and perpetuate dysfunction and corruption. If both sides are the same, neither is responsible; if Republicans are never held accountable because they can get away with \u201cwhataboutism,\u201d they will never reform. Democrats understandably bemoan the contrived equivalence that infects news coverage. However, instead of complaining that it\u2019s not fair for their side to be held to a higher standard, they should tout their adherence, however imperfectly, to some level of responsible, decent conduct. They should give voters some credit. Voters have registered their disapproval of Trump, deplored his dishonesty and punished Republicans at the polls in the midterms. Sometimes doing the right thing is smart politics. When Democratic supporters and activists tell pols not to criticize their own because \u201cRepublicans don\u2019t hold their side accountable!\u201d Democrats should be proud to respond: Darn right. But we do.","4":"THE KEY Within 18 months, your phone may be able to identify you based on the gait of your walk, the tension in your hand or the way your thumb moves across the touch screen.\u00a0 That\u2019s the\u00a0Pentagon's plan: It's in the final phase of testing technology that will reduce smartphone users\u2019 reliance on difficult-to-remember passwords or an endless stream of text message verification codes, an official there told me.\u00a0 It's working with computer chipmakers and smartphone developers to make the technology commercially available as early as 2020, said Steven Wallace, a systems innovation scientist at the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Information Systems Agency, or DISA. It's currently testing the system on 50 phones at the Defense Department.\u00a0 \u201cOur goal from the very start was not to have something that was focused solely on the DoD,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cOur focus from the start was something usable at the commercial level.\u201d The tech companies haven\u2019t made any firm commitments to adopt the identification system\u00a0but appear eager to integrate the technology into smartphones within the next year or two, Wallace said. He declined to name the companies DISA is working with but said if\u00a0all goes well, the technology \u201cwill be available in the majority of handsets\u201d in the United States.\u00a0 The technology would offer an extra layer of security for smartphone users by ensuring that a thief -- or someone who, say, picks up a phone left on a subway seat or park bench -- doesn\u2019t get access to all the personal and professional information stored inside the device, Wallace said. If stolen phones are inoperable, there's less of a market for them. And more broadly, if consumer devices are better protected, national security improves: It gets tougher for hackers to steal information and intellectual property. But the Pentagon's motivation is not just about securing consumers: If the tool is commercially available, the Pentagon can get the extra protection without paying an arm and a leg for specialized devices that only highly secured industries are using.\u00a0In the past, Wallace said, the Pentagon has built super-secure smartphones but they've been too costly to deploy to anyone but a handful of top officials -- costing more than $4,500 per unit.\u00a0 Once the technology is fully vetted, DoD plans to use the technology for general purpose smartphones but not ones that access classified information, he said.\u00a0 Wallace hopes the cutting-edge identity verification system will be like the\u00a0Global Positioning System and the Internet itself \u2014 in that they are all tools that were initially developed for military use but ended up benefiting society at large. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that we\u2019re going to create something that\u2019s as broad and as grand as GPS or the Internet, but there\u2019s a history of the department working on things\u00a0and those things ending up in consumer devices,\u201d Wallace told me. Similar technology is\u00a0being used to verify the identities of some employees in highly regulated industries, such as financial services and health care, but it isn\u2019t deployed commercially, Dawud Gordon, CEO of the company TwoSense, which is working on a separate but related DISA project, told me. Those industry tools build the sensing technology into software rather than into the smartphone's hardware, Gordon told me.\u00a0 The DISA project relies on sensors that already exist inside smartphone computer chips and are used by gaming apps but not generally for security, Wallace told me.\u00a0 DISA is working with a contractor to use those sensors to create a unique profile for how each smartphone user does various things, he said \u2014 including walking with the phone, typing on it and pulling it out of her pocket or purse. DISA then creates a \"risk score\" for the user that includes a weighted combination of all those factors, he said. If this score drops too low the person will be locked out of the phone.\u00a0 If a person is locked out in error, she could regain access using a more standard log in, such as a password, Wallace told me.\u00a0 Just because the capability exists in the phone\u2019s hardware doesn\u2019t mean people would\u00a0have to use it to verify their identities, Wallace said. The smartphone provider could offer it as an option or organizations could use it to ensure employees don't leave unsecured devices in cabs or restaurants. Because the sensors are on the phone\u2019s hardware, the information they collect won\u2019t be available to phone apps or other third parties, Wallace said, reducing privacy concerns. The only information that should leave the hardware side is when the phone user\u2019s risk score drops too low and she\u2019s locked out, he said.

(Mary Altaffer\/AP) \u2014 The finance and insurance industry was malicious hackers' favorite target in 2018, according to the annual\u00a0IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index released today.\u00a0This industry drew 19 percent of all\u00a0attacks and incidents last year, followed by transportation services\u00a0with 13 percent. \u201cWe expect the transportation sector to continue rising as an attractive target for malicious actors, because of the industry\u2019s reliance on information technology to facilitate operations, its ubiquitous need for integration of third-party vendors, and its vast supply chain,\u201d the report said.\u00a0\u201cThese factors make for a larger attack surface than other industries.\u201d The report also found that cyber criminals appear to rely less on ransomware attacks and more on cryptojacking\u00a0\u2014\u00a0an attack that allows hackers to use other people's devices to mine cryptocurrency. \u2014 Security researchers found a sharp increase in the size of distributed denial-of-service attacks against companies involved in market research and public opinion polling between the second half of 2017 and the second half of 2018, according to cybersecurity company NETSCOUT's Threat Intelligence Landscape Report, which was released today.

Russian TV lists nuclear targets in U.S.","5":"After a triumphant start this year in which she bested President Trump in an epic showdown over a government shutdown, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now struggling to unify Democrats after two weeks of painful infighting that could have lasting ramifications for her newfound majority and the 2020 election. The bitter intraparty dispute, which centered on remarks by freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) that many in both parties viewed as anti-Semitic, resulted in the passage last week of a resolution broadly condemning hatred that received unanimous support from Democrats \u2014 yet served to underscore Pelosi\u2019s deep challenges in bridging schisms of race, religion, age and gender within her vastly diverse caucus. The episode also suggested that a power struggle between a group of vocal newcomers on the left, including Omar and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), and veteran lawmakers is likely to be a persistent problem for Pelosi (D-Calif.) as she seeks to keep the party focused on opposing Trump and his agenda ahead of the 2020 elections. Omar has refused to apologize for the comments that set off last week\u2019s firestorm, when she suggested that Israel\u2019s supporters have \u201can allegiance to a foreign country.\u201d And Ocasio-Cortez asserted in a fundraising message that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), an influential pro-Israel group, was \u201ccoming after\u201d her, Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) over their foreign policy views. Pelosi\u2019s ability to navigate such divisions could have far-reaching implications. If the party\u2019s tensions on subjects ranging from health care to climate change \u2014 not to mention age and strategy \u2014 continue to boil over publicly, they are likely to distract from Democrats\u2019 desired messages to voters and provide fodder for Republican attacks. \u201cI see the challenge [Pelosi] has with the far left and some of the freshmen coming in now who have high energy, so she\u2019s trying to balance that out,\u201d said Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (D-Mass.), a centrist who has criticized Pelosi in the past but argued that she has done a good job under the circumstances. \u201cBeing a speaker \u2014 especially on the Democratic side \u2014 is like herding cats,\u201d said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.). \u201c.\u2009.\u2009. The cats have to understand who provides the water and kibble and cleans the litter. Once the cats understand that, it\u2019ll get better.\u201d Cohen also argued that the freshmen could cripple the party if they don\u2019t fall in line soon.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a shame because they weren\u2019t in the wilderness for eight years, as we were in the minority,\u201d he said. Republicans, meanwhile, are elated at their sudden change in fortune. For two years, House GOP leaders tried to play down their own internal strife as Trump threw the party into disarray. Now their divisions are an afterthought. \u201cWe understand what it\u2019s like to be in the majority. It\u2019s tough,\u201d said Rep. Patrick T. McHenry (R-N.C.), a former chief deputy whip. \u201cAnd it\u2019s clear they\u2019re having [an] even tougher time than we had.\u201d Pelosi and her team have played down party tensions and blamed the news media for exaggerating internal Democratic strife. \u201cThe Democratic Party is inherently a coalition party; we are not a caucus that is 99\u00a0percent old white men,\u201d Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said in a statement Sunday. \u201cSometimes that takes time. Sometimes it takes a lot of discussion and listening. And that\u2019s always been something [Pelosi] excels at \u2014 and at the end of the day we get the job done.\u201d Asked about the fiery freshmen Friday during an interview at the Economic Club of Washington, Pelosi lavished praise on the newbies, saying they were a \u201cjoy\u201d and an \u201cinvigoration.\u201d During a news conference earlier in the week, Pelosi had also mused about how she had once been a vocal activist just like them. \u201cThat was me pushing a stroller and carrying those signs!\u201d she said. But at other times, cracks showed through Pelosi\u2019s confident exterior. During a leadership meeting on Tuesday night, Pelosi grew angry and raised her voice to Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) when Dingell pulled out her phone and read a tweet by Ocasio-Cortez, according to two people who were there and requested anonymity to disclose details of a private meeting. In the tweet, Ocasio-Cortez defended Omar, her close friend, as Pelosi and her leadership team were readying an initial version of the resolution responding to Omar\u2019s foreign allegiance remark. In the meeting, Dingell agreed with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s assessment that House Democrats shouldn\u2019t be focused on rebuking one of their own but should also be calling out homophobia, racism and xenophobia in general. According to the people in the room, Pelosi was offended at the suggestion that Democrats didn\u2019t already stand up against all forms of hate and grew visibly angry. As it turned out, Dingell wasn\u2019t the only lawmaker who wanted to broaden the scope of the resolution. The Congressional Black Caucus \u2014 furious that their colleagues hadn\u2019t done more to call out racist comments in the past \u2014 agreed, as did some of Omar\u2019s liberal colleagues and several Democrats running for president, who took to Twitter and pushed back against Pelosi\u2019s original plan focusing on anti-Semitism alone. A Pelosi spokesman said the speaker supported broadening the language all along. But when Pelosi changed course, Jewish members grew upset. One of them, Rep. Ted Deutch (Fla.), a Pelosi ally, took his concerns to the House floor to ask why they couldn\u2019t simply pass a resolution calling out hate against Jews. Trump reveled in the mess, accusing Democrats of being \u201canti-Israel\u201d and \u201canti-Jewish.\u201d And the entire ordeal \u2014 sparked by a freshman who refused to mute her criticism of U.S. policy toward Israel \u2014 stole headlines away from a major campaign finance package that the House passed Friday.\u00a0 Pelosi\u2019s predicament is a dramatic shift from just a month ago, when even her critics were awed by her ability to unify Democrats through a 35-day shutdown, refusing to give Trump even $1 for his promised southern border wall with Mexico. The speaker, long hailed as one of the savviest leaders in modern political history, found herself playing peacemaker and imploring her colleagues to play nice. \u201cThe best advice I ever received when I came here those years ago was: Don't question the motivations of our colleagues,\u201d Pelosi told her members in a tense private meeting last week, according to one source in the room. \u201cYou can disagree wholeheartedly, but do not question their patriotism or their loyalty to our country in any way. And that holds for the Republicans as well.\u201d During the same meeting, freshman Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.) challenged Pelosi for not telling the caucus about the Omar resolution before it became public. And Democrats scolded each other for tweeting mean comments at their colleagues. \u201cLook, when you have an exciting, diverse class with many new members, we all have to get to know each other and respect each other\u2019s values. But at this point, we\u2019re moving on,\u201d said Rep. Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.), a Jewish member who fought with Omar on Twitter about her comments. \u201cI think the lesson learned is that we have to understand each other and respect each other.\u201d Speaking privately to members Thursday morning, House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) compared the atmosphere among Democrats with his own experiences in the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Clyburn was a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which wanted aggressive action to force radical changes. That group clashed with the old guard of activists, led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, who were determined to move more carefully toward the same goal. \u201cWe all have roles to play,\u201d Clyburn told reporters Friday, describing what he learned from his experiences then. \u201cMy thing is: You listen to people, you make sure that you get them to some level of comfort.\u201d The progressive wing is not the only group causing headaches for Pelosi. Democrats have been clashing over Republican maneuvering after moderates \u2014 many of them freshmen who defeated GOP incumbents \u2014 voted against their own party on politically divisive Republican amendments. The internal frustration kicked into high gear last month after the GOP notched a surprise win on a high-profile gun-control bill, with Pelosi demanding that lawmakers toe the party line. The issue remains a point of tension. Pelosi\u2019s deputies \u2014 Clyburn and Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) \u2014 had encouraged some in the caucus to vote their district even if it meant siding with Republicans occasionally, while Pelosi protested. The three huddled last week to try to get on the same page. On Thursday morning, some freshmen vented privately about the mixed messages they had gotten from House leaders about the process at a meeting hosted by Assistant Speaker Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (D-N.M.), according to two people present.\u00a0\u00a0 With a major Democratic bill involving elections and ethics rules changes hanging in the balance on Friday, Pelosi faced a fresh test as she sought to enforce order. When Republicans offered a measure targeting voting by illegal immigrants, her leadership team chose one of the moderate freshmen who had voted for some of the earlier GOP amendments, Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.), to rally his colleagues. \u201cThis is a political stunt meant to divide us, meant to sow hatred, and it\u2019s a game, nothing less,\u201d Rose said. During the vote, Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn huddled over a table monitoring lists of how Democrats were voting. When only six broke with the party, Democrats cheered \u2014 a bright spot in a tough week. \u201cWhen you assume the role of the majority party, there are necessarily steps that must be taken in order to adjust,\u201d Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.) said. \u201cThere are some things that need to be worked out in the caucus, but the [leadership team] understands that and is working on it.\u201d Said first-term Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.): \u201cWhat we learned is that we\u2019re a caucus with growing pains, which is totally normal and natural.\u201d","6":"Around the time of President Trump\u2019s inauguration, two of his supporters met to toast the new administration at the Russia House, a Washington restaurant known among Russian diplomats and emigres for its vodka and caviar. The Dupont Circle spot was suggested by Sergei Millian, according to onetime Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who said he met with the Belarus-born businessman there. The get-together followed months of outreach Millian had made to the young aide \u2014 including offering him a lucrative consulting contract to work simultaneously for Trump and an unidentified Russian, which Papadopoulos said he rebuffed. FBI agents later pressed Papadopoulos about his relationship with Millian, Papadopoulos\u2019s lawyers have said. The interactions between the two men \u2014 the extent of which have not been reported previously \u2014 show how Millian, a self-described real estate developer who served as an unwitting source of information for former British spy Christopher Steele, was in closer proximity to Trump\u2019s world than previously known. As he was working to build a relationship with Papadopoulos in 2016, Millian also offered to serve as a conduit to the Trump campaign for a Belarusan author in Florida with connections to the Russian government, according to emails obtained by The Washington Post. The author, Mikhail Morgulis, who said he never ended up hearing from anyone in the campaign, later claimed that he rallied Russian Americans to back Trump. The new details deepen the persistent mystery surrounding Millian, two years after he was identified as one of the unnamed sources in a campaign dossier Steele compiled for Democrats about Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. At the time, little was known about Millian\u2019s connection to the New York developer, other than the fact that he said he had sold units at a Trump property in Florida years ago. Millian, who has denied being a source for the dossier, has largely disappeared from public view, despite efforts by congressional investigators to interview him \u2014 taking with him potential answers about the president\u2019s links to Russia and some of the dossier\u2019s still-unproved claims. The House and Senate intelligence committees have tried to interview Millian, according to people familiar with the panels\u2019 work. Millian did not respond to the Senate committee, one person said. In a report issued last year, House Democrats said that Millian was unwilling to appear before their panel without being granted immunity and they called on Republicans to subpoena him. Now back in majority control, House Democrats said they plan to renew efforts to obtain his testimony. \u201cSergei Millian remains someone of deep interest to our investigation,\u201d said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the new chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, citing Millian\u2019s \u201copaque business and personal history\u201d and interactions with Papadopoulos. It is unknown whether Millian has been interviewed by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. Millian, whose social media posts in recent months have included images recycled from years-old events, did not respond to requests for comment. His exact role in Trump\u2019s world remains elusive. Was he a business associate with an insider\u2019s perspective on the candidate\u2019s business adventures in Moscow? A self-promoting braggart spinning false tales? A Russian intelligence operative? Papadopoulos said he thinks Millian was working with the FBI to target the Trump campaign. But two people familiar with the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation said that Millian was not working with the bureau during his interactions with Papadopoulos. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment. An acquaintance of Millian who exchanges texts with him and thinks he has been unfairly targeted by the media says he thinks Millian lives in New York, but is not sure. \u201cOne time he sent me a photo. He was in Europe somewhere. He was on some bridge,\u201d said Jeff Jetton, a Washington restaurateur and writer who befriended Millian shortly after his role in the dossier became public. \u201cI don\u2019t really question him about where he is. He doesn\u2019t question me about where I am. I don\u2019t really care.\u201d Millian, now 40, came to Steele\u2019s attention after the firm Fusion GPS hired the former British intelligence officer in June 2016 to research Trump\u2019s business history in Russia on behalf of Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. Born in Belarus and given the name Siarhei Kukuts, Millian went to college in Minsk, where a Russian-language version of his biography that he posted online said he trained to be a military translator. He moved to Atlanta in the early 2000s, changed his name to Sergei Millian, and began working in real estate and professional translating, according to friends at the time and his biography. There, he founded a trade group called the Russian American Chamber of Commerce in the USA, which gave him a platform to interact with business and government leaders in the United States and Russia. It also boosted Millian\u2019s profile. In 2011, he was invited to take part in a Russian government-backed effort to bring American entrepreneurs on visits to Moscow. The Post has previously reported that the FBI later investigated the trips as possible influence operations linked to Russian intelligence, although Millian was never implicated. In his organization\u2019s literature and elsewhere, Millian boasted of a relationship with Trump, saying that he had been engaged to sell apartments to rich Russians in the Trump Hollywood condo building in Florida. On Facebook and in literature for his Russian chamber of commerce, he posted a photo of himself with Trump, snapped at a horse track in Miami in 2007 after he said \u201cmutual associates\u201d introduced them. It is unclear whether they met on any other occasion. But in April 2016, Millian gave the Russian state-operated news organization RIA Novosti an eyebrow-raising interview. He claimed that after meeting Trump in Miami he went to New York and met Trump\u2019s \u201cright-hand man\u201d \u2014 his personal lawyer Michael Cohen \u2014 and then signed a contract to sell Trump units in Florida. \u201cYou can say that I was their exclusive broker,\u201d he said, speaking in Russian. \u201cBack then, in 2007-2008, Russians by the dozens were buying apartments in Trump\u2019s buildings in the USA.\u201d Asked in the Russian interview how often he spoke to Trump or his associates, Millian responded: \u201cThe last time was several days ago.\u201d In an interview in 2016 with ABC News, Millian claimed to have high-level contacts in the Russian government. He said he was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d affiliated with Russian intelligence. Cohen has denied meeting Millian and extending him a contract to sell Trump-branded condos. He said in a 2017 interview with The Post that Millian was a fraud who had no substantive connection to Trump or his company, and that the Miami photo was no different from hundreds that Trump took with fans each year. \u201cHe is a total phony,\u201d Cohen said at the time. \u201cAnything coming out of this individual\u2019s mouth is inaccurate and purely part of some deranged interest in having his name in the newspaper.\u201d Last year, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about his efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the campaign, as well as to bank fraud and to campaign finance violations. As part of his plea deal, he agreed to provide information to Mueller. Cohen\u2019s spokesman, Lanny Davis, declined to comment about Millian. The Post has previously reported that in his research reports, Steele described Millian \u2014 who was identified in one report as \u201cSource D\u201d and in another as \u201cSource E\u201d \u2014 as a \u201cclose associate of Trump\u201d who had given a \u201ccompatriot\u201d information in confidence in late July 2016. The information attributed to Millian included the dossier\u2019s most prurient claim: that Trump cavorted with prostitutes in Moscow. The document also cited Millian as a source for the assertion that a \u201cwell developed conspiracy of cooperation\u201d existed between the Trump campaign and Russian leaders. Steele has declined to discuss his sources. Trump has repeatedly denied those allegations and denounced the dossier as \u201cphony stuff\u201d cooked up by Democrats to frame his campaign. Millian has insisted that he is a victim of Trump\u2019s enemies and the news media. He has said he was not a source for information that Steele collected. \u201cI want to say that I don\u2019t have any compromising information, neither in Russia nor in the United States, nor could I have,\u201d he said in a 2017 appearance on Russian television. \u201cWithout a doubt it is a blatant lie and an effort of some people \u2014 it\u2019s definitely a group of people \u2014 to portray [Trump] in a bad light using my name.\u201d He has declined to answer detailed questions from The Post and other news organizations about his relationship with Trump or his activities during the campaign. The messages were exchanged between Millian and Morgulis, a Soviet-born author and theologian who broadcast Christian-themed radio programs into the Soviet Union after moving to the United States in the 1980s. Now living in Florida, Morgulis leads a Christian ministry and serves as honorary consul of Belarus, Millian\u2019s home country and a former Soviet state closely aligned with President Vladi\u00admir Putin\u2019s Russia. Morgulis served from 2014 to 2018 on the coordinating council of a group called the Russian Community Council of the USA, according to Elena Branson, its chairwoman. She said the group is a nonprofit cultural enrichment organization for Russian emigres living in the United States. The Russian Foreign Ministry sometimes reimburses members who travel to conferences or other events, Branson said. In a July 2016 email exchange, Millian told Morgulis that he would soon be meeting with Trump\u2019s campaign and offered to pass along messages. \u201cThe meeting will be strictly confidential, I won\u2019t be able to invite you to it. If you want me to pass them any information, I will do it, and if they get interested, I will ask them to meet with you,\u201d Millian wrote to Morgulis in Russian. \u201cMaybe the main thing for them is this,\u201d Morgulis responded. \u201cWe can organize the Russian community to vote for Trump. If you are interested in getting 5 million people, I am ready to participate in this campaign, together with you.\u201d A Trump campaign spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The emails were provided to The Post anonymously by a person who claimed to represent a group monitoring Russian activities against Ukraine and declined to say how they were obtained. Morgulis confirmed their authenticity, saying he thought his private correspondence had been stolen. Morgulis told The Post in an email that he is a Republican who supported Trump but that he never heard from anyone in the campaign about his proposal to organize the Russian-born community. He said he has known Millian for about seven or eight years, since the younger businessman contacted him when he was living in Atlanta. During the campaign, Morgulis said that Millian said he had become \u201cclose to the Trump campaign, since he knew someone in Trump\u2019s group.\u201d But Morgulis said he was skeptical that Millian had any influence on Trump\u2019s operation. \u201cHis political weight was too insignificant,\u201d he wrote in Russian. \u201cIt was a character trait of Sergei\u2019s that he liked to make himself out to be a more important person than he was in reality. .\u2009.\u2009. He is too weak a swimmer to catch any political crocodiles.\u201d After the election, Morgulis took credit in interviews with Russian media for helping to elect Trump by organizing Russian-speaking voters. \u201cI personally visited 11 cities in Florida, where I said that if you want our new president to be a homosexual .\u2009.\u2009. vote for Hillary,\u201d he said a July 2017 interview with the Russian government-funded outlet Sputnik, touting a false claim popular among some conservative conspiracy theorists. In the interview, he also said he had briefly met both Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Morgulis declined to comment on those claims. Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Trump, and Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for Kushner, declined to comment. Around the same time he was in contact with Morgulis, Millian was also seeking to build a relationship with Papadopoulos, a young energy consultant and foreign policy adviser to Trump who had been urging the candidate to meet with Putin. Papadopoulos had helped trigger the initial counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign when he told an Australian diplomat that a London contact relayed to him that the Russians had thousands of emails that could be damaging to Clinton. Papadopoulos said that he first heard from Millian on July 22, 2016 \u2014 the same day WikiLeaks published hacked Democratic Party emails. In that note, Millian described himself as a Trump adviser and offered to help explain the U.S.-Russia relationship, Papadopoulos said. The two struck up an online correspondence and met several times, Papadopoulos said. Millian claimed to be a business associate of the candidate and told Papadopoulos that he had connections at Bashneft, a Russian energy company that he said was looking for American investors. By October, Papadopoulos said Millian approached him with an idea: He said he could get Papadopoulos a public relations contract with a New York firm connected to an unidentified Russian national. The job would pay $30,000 a month, Millian told him. \u201cIt was an enticing offer,\u201d Papadopoulos said. He said he was clear with Millian from the start that he would not work for any Russian under U.S. sanctions. In the fall of 2016, Millian flew to Chicago, where Papadopoulos was living at the time, to discuss the proposal. The two met at the bar of the Trump International Hotel. Papadopoulos said that Millian seemed nervous during the meeting. He was pacing, sweating and wearing a scarf around his neck, even though they were indoors. Then, Millian explained that the job would require Papadopoulos to continue to work for Trump after the election. \u201cHe said, \u2018You know, George, in Russia it\u2019s very common for people to work both in the private and public sector at the same time,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Papadopoulos recalled Millian telling him. Papadopoulos said he knew the offer was unethical \u2014 and possibly illegal. \u201cI told him, \u2018Absolutely not,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Papadopoulos recalled. Later, Papadopoulos said he concluded that the meeting may have been a setup \u2014 perhaps, he thought, by the FBI, which he learned had arranged for one of its confidential sources, a Cambridge University professor, to meet with him that fall. He said his suspicions were deepened over drinks during the inauguration at Russia House. Millian, he said, was accompanied by a friend from Atlanta, a Moroccan American music producer named Aziz Choukri, who Papadopoulos said announced that Millian had been working for the FBI. Papadopoulos said Millian looked sheepish. In an interview, Choukri said he recalled having drinks with Papadopoulos and Millian but insisted that he never said anything about the FBI. \u201cI never mentioned that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie.\u2019\u2019 The Daily Caller first reported that Papadopoulos met with Millian and Choukri around the inauguration. A week after the Russia House gathering, FBI agents showed up at Papadopoulos\u2019s apartment in Chicago to question him about his contacts with Russians. Agents first told the young aide that they were primarily interested in his relationship with Millian, Papadopoulos\u2019s lawyers have said. In September, one week before Papadopoulos was sentenced to 14 days in prison for lying to the FBI, Millian tweeted some news: He had launched a GoFundMe account to raise money to help him \u201cprotect our constitutional rights and fight against censorship!\u201d Titled \u201cFriends and Enemies of Donald Trump,\u201d the page featured the 2007 photo of Millian and Trump at the racetrack in Miami. \u201cThe Fake News consortiums are active members of the Deep State who tread on our constitutional rights. Let us stand together to protect our Constitution!\u201d he wrote in a long post. \u201cThis page will serve as an assessment if the public is interested and ready to handle the truth no matter where it leads to from a first-hand account,\u201d he continued. The account carried a goal of raising $1 million. As of Wednesday evening, no donations had been recorded.","7":"THE PROGNOSIS Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R). (Timothy D. Easley\/AP) The Trump administration will appear today before a federal judge to defend one of its most consequential and controversial moves on health insurance \u2014 a green light for states to require their Medicaid enrollees to work or volunteer. And the administration\u2019s prospects for success don\u2019t look great at this point, considering the judge hearing the oral arguments\u00a0previously called the Department of Health and Human Services \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d for approving work requirements at all. U.S. District Judge Jeb Boasberg, an Obama appointee, will hear two separate but related lawsuits this morning at the federal courthouse in the District. The first is a challenge to Medicaid work requirements in Arkansas, one of just three states that have been allowed to put them into effect so far. The second is a challenge to similar requirements in Kentucky, which Boasberg blocked in June. Expect the arguments to further inflame a passionate debate among lawmakers and health-care advocates about whether the low-income Americans who benefit from the Medicaid program should be required to show that they\u2019ve obtained a job or engaged in other approved activities such as volunteering or job training. Whether it\u2019s legal under federal law for states to impose such requirements is the\u00a0key question at stake here. Opponents of work requirements argue it violates the spirit \u2014\u00a0and, in some cases, the text \u2014 of the Social Security Act, which lays out Medicaid as a \u201cmedical assistance program.\u201d \u201cA frontal assault on the objectives of Medicaid is shocking and brazen,\u201d Eliot Fishman, senior director of health policy for Families USA, told reporters earlier this week. But HHS Secretary Alex Azar and Medicaid chief Seema Verma claim work requirements are legal because they are aimed at helping people move out of poverty entirely. The agency has approved work requirements for\u00a0seven states that have requested them, although only Arkansas, New Hampshire and Indiana have implemented them so far. Arkansas has become a focal point of the whole debate, as more than 18,000 of the state\u2019s 234,000 Medicaid enrollees lost coverage last year either for failing to comply with the requirements or for failing to report their compliance to the state. Under the state\u2019s new rules, beneficiaries lose coverage if they don\u2019t meet the requirements for three months within one year. Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.)\u00a0speaks on Capitol Hill.\u00a0(Jacquelyn Martin\/AP) Azar said Tuesday that HHS does \u201cnot yet have data as to why they fell off the program,\u201d when queried about the Arkansas situation by Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.). In a heated exchange, Kennedy asked Azar why President Trump\u2019s budget proposal this week backed enacting work requirements nationwide if it had incomplete data about the effects of the policy. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s a fundamental aspect for able-bodied adults, if you are receiving free health care from the taxpayer, that it\u2019s not too much to ask you would engage in some form of community activity,\u201d Azar responded. \u201cHealthier people working is not the same thing as work making people healthier,\u201d Kennedy retorted. The evidence in Arkansas of work requirements causing people to fall off Medicaid could make it even harder for HHS to convince\u00a0Boasberg of the validity of\u00a0its position this time around. In his ruling over summer, the judge said the agency didn\u2019t adequately assess the impact of work requirements on enrollment overall. \u201cAt minimum, the Secretary failed to \u2018adequately analyze\u2019 coverage,\u201d Boasberg wrote. \u201cThere are two basic elements to that problem: First, whether the project would cause recipients to lose coverage. Second, whether the project would help promote coverage. The Secretary, however, neglected both.\u201d And there\u2019s something else that encourages opponents of work requirements. In November, the nonpartisan panel that advises on Medicaid policy sent HHS a letter urging it to pause Arkansas\u2019s work requirements until it had taken steps to help enrollees comply. \u201cThe low level of reporting is a strong warning signal that the current process may not be structured in a way that provides individuals an opportunity to succeed, with high stakes for beneficiaries who fail,\u201d wrote Penny Thompson, chairman of the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission. AHH: The Food and Drug Administration announced a new policy that aims to make it more difficult for minors to buy flavored e-cigarette products, the latest in an effort to curb youth vaping. The policy, a key effort by\u00a0outgoing FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, will limit the sale of fruity and kid-friendly flavors of vaping products to stores that prohibit minors or that have adult-only sections, our\u00a0Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports. Online sellers of these products will also have to tighten age verification and limit the quantities that are sold. Any companies that violate these rules will be subject to enforcement actions from the agency, which can include\u00a0stripping their products from the market. Gottlieb had detailed a plan similar to the new draft guidance back in November. \u201cGottlieb also moved up by one year the deadline for flavored e-cigarettes to get agency approval \u2014 to August 2021,\u201d Laurie writes. \u201cThe sales restrictions and new deadline would apply to a vast array of e-cigarette products, including those offered in flavors such as cherry and bubblegum. They would not apply to mint, menthol and tobacco flavors unless those products were being sold in a way that targeted minors because the agency says those products are most often used by adult smokers trying to quit.\u201d OOF: The leader of one\u00a0of the country's largest insurers expressed openness this week to\u00a0Medicare-for-all. Humana CEO Bruce Broussard said he views the idea as a potentially enormous opportunity for the health insurance industry, Insider Louisville reports. \u201cFor me, I think it\u2019s a great opportunity for the industry to be able to expand the population that it\u2019s coordinating care with,\u201d Broussard said Tuesday at the Barclays Global Healthcare Conference in Miami Beach, Fla.\u00a0 But Broussard said he would expect a Medicare-for-all plan to still involve the private sector working in conjunction with the federal government to provide care, comparing it to the way the U.S. manages its space program. And\u00a0he warned that there are big, outstanding questions about how such a system would work\u00a0and who would pay for it. Partnership for America's Health Care Future -- the coalition of industry groups opposing all iterations of Medicare-for-all -- pushed back against Broussard's remarks. \u201cFacts show there simply aren\u2019t circumstances under which would a Medicare for All-style proposal represents a \u2018great opportunity,'\" the group's Executive Director Lauren Crawford Shaver said in a statement provided to Health 202. \"Whether you call it Medicare for All, Medicare buy-in, a public option, or single-payer, it would lead to a one-size-fits-all government-run system. It would disrupt Americans\u2019 coverage including longer waits, lower the quality of care, force families to pay more, and threaten the Medicare program our seniors have been promised and rely on.\" OUCH: Nearly 100 countries reported\u00a0marked surges in measles cases last year\u00a0over the previous year, according to a new U.N.\u00a0report. The rise was in part due to complacency among parents and unwarranted concerns about vaccination, the report found. Recent measles outbreaks have also led to questions in countries over the ramifications for families unwilling to vaccinate children, even as most countries say that decision is up to the parents, our Post colleague Rick Noack writes. \u201cA law that took effect at the beginning of 2016 in the Australian state of Victoria made vaccinations a condition for the enrollment of children in preschool,\u201d he reports. \u201cFamilies unwilling to have their children vaccinated were also refused access to family assistance payments, except if kids were ineligible to receive vaccinations because of allergies. In Europe, Italian lawmakers followed suit in 2017, banning children from nurseries if they had not received a total of 10 mandatory vaccinations and imposing fines on parents of unvaccinated school-age kids. In a sign of how politically divisive the issue remains, the populist Five Star Movement later suspended the rule temporarily. When that suspension order expired this week, hundreds of children were denied access to kindergartens across the country.\u201d Critics of these sort of measures say it\u2019s more important to debunk conspiracy theories\u00a0related to vaccines and raise public awareness to their importance. In Finland, for example, there are no mandatory vaccination policies, but efforts such as vaccination in schools and public awareness campaigns have contributed to immunization rates of 95 to 99 percent. \u2014In December, officials in the county at the center of New York\u2019s worst measles outbreak in decades, were compelled to ban unvaccinated children from going to schools that had vaccination rates lower than 95 percent. Months later, the parents of more than 40 of those children sued the Rockland County health department to get their children back in the classroom. But a federal judge\u00a0rejected that request this week. The parents are calling it an \u201cexclusion order\u201d that has \u201ccaused and continues to cause irreparable harm,\u201d our Post colleague Reis Thebault reports. U.S. District Court Judge Vincent Briccetti said it wasn\u2019t in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d to let them go back to class. \u201cWhile no one enjoys the fact that these kids are out of school, these orders have worked,\" said county attorney, Thomas Humbach, in a statement to the local Journal News. \"They have helped prevent the measles outbreak from spreading to this school population.\u201d The parents\u2019 lawyer Michael Sussman told the New York Times: \u201cWhat Rockland County has done is remarkably irrational in every conceivable way.\u201d Rockland county\u2019s effort is the latest effort that exemplifies concern nationwide over the anti-vaccination movement. At the private Green Meadow Waldorf school, where the kids were banned, \u201cthe vaccination rate was just 33 percent when the December ban took effect,\u201d Reis writes. \u201cSince then, the county said it has risen to 56 percent, though a school\u2019s spokeswoman told the Times the share was actually 83 percent \u2014 either way, short of the mandated threshold.\u201d \u2014 During Azar\u2019s second day on Capitol Hill this week, Democratic lawmakers spent part of the two-hour hearing grilling him on the administration\u2019s family separation policy. \u201cWe continue to hear reports that family separation is still occurring, despite a judge\u2019s order to stop it,\u201d Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), the chairwoman of the House Appropriations subcommittee said in her opening statement. \u201cWe are also learning that it may have started earlier than previously known in July 2017. The administration may have separated thousands more children before Congress and the public learned of this immoral policy.\u201d She told Azar his agency is \u201ccomplicit\u201d with \u201cgovernment-sponsored abuse.\u201d When asked by Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) about whether there was any funding in the Trump's latest budget request to address the issue of separated children, Azar explained there isn\u2019t an \u201congoing program other than the normal family separations we have because of child welfare done by [The Department of Homeland Security].\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have a bigger issue right now in terms of separation; we receive a relatively small number, which are according to standards which are fairly consistent with the long time history of the program,\u201d he said.\u00a0He did acknowledge issues with \u201cinformation flows.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest issue. I demanded back in June we put a box on the intake form any indication of separation, so there\u2019s an easy way to track that that\u2019s happened,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked for more information from DHS\u2026 on any rationale why there was a separation because that can be useful to us. We don\u2019t decide or get to veto a separation but that helps us decide whether there\u2019s a reunification or sponsorship issue.\u201d Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) asked the secretary if the administration had looked into the mental health implications of the separations. \u201cIf you understood and this administration understood the history of what this does to children and families over the years, you never would have done this,\" Lee said, citing the history of generational trauma related to slavery and slave trade. \"I\u2019m wondering if any health care professionals\u2026 looked into this?\u201d Azar responded: \u201cLet me be very clear there\u2019s no dispute between us that children being away from their parents is a bad thing, that it poses mental health issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have encouraged people, do\u00a0not come across the border illegally.\u201d \u2014 Two pharmacy benefit managers have agreed to appear before the Senate Finance Committee early next month, following an invitation from Chairman\u00a0Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and the committee\u2019s top Democrat, Ron Wyden (Ore.) to five of the country's top pharmacy middlemen who negotiate prices and coverage between insurers and drug makers.\u00a0 Grassley and Wyden sent letters to Cigna, Prime Therapeutics, OptumRx, Humana,\u00a0and CVS Health and CVS Caremark, inviting them to testify in an April 3 committee hearing.

Martha McSally (R-Ariz.)\u00a0is asking the Air Force to have a summit on sexual assault in the military.\u00a0The freshman senator, who revealed last week during a congressional hearing that she had been raped by a superior while serving in the Air Force, sent a letter to Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson calling on her to gather with senior leaders and policy experts for a discussion within the next month, our Post colleague Colby Itkowitz reports. \u201cI firmly believe that commanders must be fully responsible for preventing and responding to sexual assault in the ranks,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHowever, if we truly want to see aggressive change, we must take a fresh look at what else needs to be done in our approach to education, prevention, investigation and prosecution of these crimes.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 She cited statistics from the Department of Defense that found in 2017, 5,277 service members reported being sexually assaulted during their military service. \u201cAnd these were just the women and men who bravely chose to report their assault,\u201d McSally wrote to Wilson. \u201cThis is simply unacceptable.\u201d A scientist prepares to inject embryos with Cas9 protein at a lab in Shenzhen, China. (Mark Schiefelbein\/AP) \u2014\u00a0The National Institutes of Health and a group of scientists and ethicists from seven countries have separately called for a moratorium on gene-editing experiments meant to alter certain heritable traits in babies. The group of scientists published a commentary in the journal Nature on Wednesday, which our Post colleague Joel Achenbach writes \u201ccame in direct response to the actions of a Chinese researcher who, disregarding a global consensus on the ethical boundaries of gene editing, altered embryos that were implanted and carried to term, resulting in the live birth of twin babies.\u201d \u201cThe new call for a moratorium is an acknowledgment that the many warnings emerging from conferences on the ethics of gene editing have not been sufficiently clear and emphatic and, in the case of the Chinese twins, have failed to prevent an ethical violation,\u201d he adds. Separately, NIH Director Francis Collins issued a statement supporting the call for a moratorium and told The Post this was the position of the federal government\u00a0and was cleared at the highest levels. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is one of the most fundamental moments of decision about the application of science to something of enormous societal consequence. Are we going to cross the line toward redesigning ourselves?\u201d Collins said. \u00a0The paper in Nature does not call for a permanent ban on gene editing of heritable traits. Today From the Fact Checker: Has Trump's tax cut 'virtually' paid for itself?","8":"With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0The resurgence of measles across the United States is generating growing bipartisan alarm on Capitol Hill, where the Senate is holding a hearing today about how the government can better combat anti-vaccination conspiracy theories that are putting lives at risk. It\u2019s an especially important topic for Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the health committee. Her home state of Washington has had 71 confirmed cases of measles since the start of the year. \u201cDiseases aren\u2019t stopped by borders, or walls or bans,\u201d she said in her opening statement. \u201cThey are stopped by doctors and nurses \u2014 by vaccines and public health awareness.\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the committee, also stressed the importance of aggressively promoting vaccinations. \u201cThere is a lot of misleading and incorrect information about vaccines that circulates online, including through social media,\u201d he said in his opening statement.\u00a0\u201cHere is what I want parents \u2026 to know: Vaccines are approved by the FDA and meet the FDA\u2019s gold standard of safety. \u2026 Vaccines save lives \u2014\u00a0the lives of those who receive vaccines and the lives of those who are too young or vulnerable to be immunized.\u201d -- During the first two months of 2019, the CDC confirmed 206 individual cases of measles across 11 states. There are six active outbreaks, defined as a cluster of three or\u00a0more incidents. There have also been confirmed cases this year in California, Oregon, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York and Texas. -- Late winter and early spring are prime time for transmission, so public health experts are on edge about the possibility of a major national outbreak in the coming weeks. -- Until the vaccine was introduced in 1963, measles used to kill an estimated 400 to 500 Americans a year, many of them young kids, and sent thousands more to the hospital. In 2000, measles was technically eliminated in the United States. But now it\u2019s back with a vengeance because so many parents have stopped vaccinating their children. Murray lamented\u00a0that, because the vaccine has been around for 56 years, \u201ca generation of new parents may not appreciate just how dangerous measles is.\u201d -- The percentage of American children under 2 years old who haven\u2019t received any vaccinations has quadrupled in the past 17 years, according to federal health data. -- All but one of the 71 cases in Washington state so far in 2019 have come from Clark County, which is just across the Columbia River from Portland, Ore. Nearly a quarter of the kids in the county, the epicenter of the anti-vaccine movement, go to school without immunizations. \u201cExperts say in order to establish herd immunity against measles\u2014in order to prevent an outbreak from occurring within a community\u2014at least 95 percent of people should be vaccinated,\u201d Murray notes. \u201cEach case isn\u2019t just a concern for family members worried about their loved ones who are sick. It\u2019s a threat to neighbors and communities.\u201d Murray was a preschool teacher and taught a parenting class at Shoreline Community College in the 1980s before she ran for school board and state Senate. She got elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992, the original Year of the Woman, by running as a \u201cmom in tennis shoes.\u201d Now she\u2019s No. 3 in Democratic leadership. \u201cThey say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. That\u2019s certainly the case here,\u201d Murray said. \u201cA dose of MMR vaccine, covering measles, mumps, and rubella, is about $20. Meanwhile, Washington state has already spent over $1 million addressing the current measles outbreak.\u201d -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee held its own hearing last Wednesday to discuss the national response to the measles threat, but it was entirely overshadowed by Michael Cohen\u2019s simultaneous appearance before the Oversight Committee. In contrast to the contentiousness of Cohen\u2019s appearance, there was bipartisan agreement. \u201cThese outbreaks are tragic since they\u2019re completely avoidable,\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.). \u201cThis is a public health problem for which science has already provided a solution,\u201d added Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.). Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, testified that the spike in cases is \u201creally unacceptable\u201d because it\u2019s so preventable. He bemoaned the difficulty of combating disinformation once it gets on the Internet. \u201cThe people who read that information may not know it\u2019s false,\u201d he said, according to the AP. \u201cThey may be well-meaning, but the spread of false information is a major problem.\u201d -- A focus of today\u2019s Senate hearing is promoting strategies for the government to improve confidence among well-intentioned parents who have been duped by all this disinformation. The committee heard testimony from an Emory University epidemiologist, a University of Tennessee pediatrician and the Immune Deficiency Foundation\u2019s president. But the star witness is likely to be a high school student from Norwalk, Ohio. Ethan Lindenberger lived for years without his proper immunizations because his mother believes in vaccine conspiracies. But the teenager consulted research from the CDC and, after he turned 18 and legally became an adult, decided to get himself vaccinated in December. His mother, Jill Wheeler, told Undark, the science magazine that first reported on the story, that her son\u2019s decision was \u201clike him spitting on me, saying \u2018You don\u2019t know anything, I don\u2019t trust you with anything.\u2019\u201d Some boys buy cigarettes, guns and\/or adult magazines to celebrate turning 18. Lindenberger got his vaccinations. After going viral for all the right reasons, he\u2019s quickly emerged as an important voice in the movement to raise awareness. He wanted to testify about his four younger siblings. His mother has indicated she will not allow his 16-year-old brother to be immunized, although he wants to be, Lindenberger told my colleague Alex Horton in an interview. He also has a 2-year-old sister. \u201cIt breaks my heart that she could get measles and she\u2019d be done,\u201d Lindenberger said. -- His home state of Ohio is one of 17 states that allow parents to opt out of vaccines for \u201cphilosophical\u201d or moral reasons: -- Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), who launched his presidential campaign last Friday, declared a state of emergency in January to contain the measles outbreak. He\u2019s pushing his legislature to change the law so parents can no longer opt out of vaccinations for personal or philosophical reasons. Inslee said it\u2019s been \u201creally painful\u201d to see his state in the national news because of the outbreak. Inslee's health secretary, John Wiesman, appeared at the hearing to call\u00a0on the federal government to launch a national campaign to counter anti-vaccine groups spreading false information. He told Lena Sun in an interview that a national campaign similar to the U.S. government campaign against smoking is what\u2019s needed to help parents understand the importance of immunizations to prevent not just measles but a variety of childhood diseases. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to counter the media of a very well-organized and connected group of a small number of folks who are having a huge impact,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re really lacking that.\u201d Amber Gorrow poses for a portrait with her son Leon at their home in Vancouver, Wash. (Alisha Jucevic for The Washington Post) -- As politicians debate, there is a pervasive climate of fear among parents in the Evergreen State. \u201cAmber Gorrow is afraid to leave her house with her infant son because she lives at the epicenter,\u201d Sun and Maureen O'Hagan reported last month from Vancouver, Wash. \u201cBorn eight weeks ago, Leon is too young to get his first measles shot, putting him at risk for the highly contagious respiratory virus \u2026 Gorrow lives in a community where she said being anti-vaccine is as acceptable as being vegan or going gluten free. \u2026 The outbreak has changed nearly every aspect of her life, which is now laser-focused on avoiding contact with children who may carry measles germs. \u2026 She canceled a family outing to a children\u2019s museum, regular trips to the library, the weekly Costco run and play dates for her daughter. \u2018I hate to say it but I\u2019m even nervous about having people over \u2014 especially people who have small children and I\u2019m not sure where they stand\u2019 on vaccinations, said Gorrow, 29, who had her older child vaccinated.\u201d -- For the first time ever, the World Health Organization listed \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d as one of the top 10 global threats in 2019. \u201cNearly 1,000 people, mostly children, have died of the illness in Madagascar this year,\u201d Sun\u00a0reports. \u201cIn Europe, measles cases are at a 20-year high, with 60,000 cases and 72 deaths. A quarter of those are in Italy, where anti-vaccine groups allied with populist politicians won passage last year of a law to end compulsory vaccines \u2014 a law repealed a short time later because of soaring measles cases.\u201d \u201cDoctors in the Philippine capital are battling an acute measles crisis, with more than 4,000 cases and 70 deaths so far, that has been blamed in part on an unwillingness to immunize babies after a scare surrounding a separate vaccination program last year,\u201d Regine Cabato and Shibani Mahtani reported recently from Manila. -- \u201cThe latest evidence unequivocally denying any link between autism and the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella \u2014 a two-dose course that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is 97 percent effective \u2014 came Monday in a paper published in the Annals of Internal Medicine,\u201d Isaac Stanley-Becker reports this morning. \u201cResearchers at Copenhagen\u2019s Statens Serum Institut examined data for Danish children born from 1999 through the end of 2010, more than half a million people all together. The epidemiologists and statisticians then used population registries to link information on vaccination status to autism diagnoses, as well as to sibling history of autism and other risk factors. The findings show that the vaccine does not increase the risk of autism, lending new statistical certainty to what was already medical consensus. The researchers further concluded that vaccination is not likely to trigger the developmental disorder in susceptible populations and is not associated with a clustering of cases appearing after immunization.\u201d -- Still, the conspiracy theories emanate from the fever swamps of the far left and the far right. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. went to Olympia, Wash., last month to attend a public hearing and rally opposing Inslee\u2019s efforts to tighten vaccine exemptions. Texas state Rep. Bill Zedler (R), pushing legislation to allow parents to more easily opt out of vaccinations for their children, falsely suggested last week that antibiotics can be used to treat measles. (It\u2019s a virus!) Arizona state Rep. Kelly Townsend (R) said mandating measles shots is \u201cCommunist\u201d last Thursday as she tried to rally opposition to an effort supported by the GOP governor to increase vaccinations. \u201cThe idea that we force someone to give up their liberty for the sake of the collective is not based on American values but rather, Communist,\u201d Townsend wrote on Facebook. Darla Shine, the wife of White House communications director and former Fox News executive Bill Shine, has routinely peddled anti-vaccine messaging on her Twitter account. She made the completely erroneous claim last month that illnesses such as measles, mumps and chickenpox \u201ckeep you healthy & fight cancer.\u201d The White House declined to comment on the tweets, per Lindsey Bever. -- Some technology companies are taking drastic steps to contain the flow of misinformation. Pinterest announced the week before last, for instance, that it is blocking all search results related to vaccinations, whether the results are medically accurate or not, as executives try to come up with a more reliable solution. Others have dragged their feet. Under pressure from lawmakers in both parties, Facebook \u2014 which has been a haven for anti-vaxxers \u2014\u00a0said three weeks ago that it\u2019s looking at removing misleading or harmful content about vaccinations. -- The Russians are also a threat vector, and they\u2019ve been making matters worse for policymakers and health professionals. Experts have identified Russian troll farms seeking to sow division inside the United States by tweeting pro- and anti-vaccine messages. Russian bots that spread malicious software have used anti-vaccine messages to attract clicks, according to cybersecurity researchers. \u201cApparently only the elite get \u2018clean\u2019 #vaccines. And what do we, normal ppl, get?! #VaccinateUS,\u201d a Russian troll account tweeted last year in a message that sought to link vaccine fearmongering and income inequality. WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: Researchers hope that shutting down a specific gene could offer a way to cure HIV. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) -- \u201cA London man has been in remission from HIV for a year and a half, without drugs, after receiving a stem cell transplant of virus-resistant cells \u2014 raising the prospect that he has become the second person to be cured of the disease,\u201d Carolyn Johnson reports. \u201cThe London patient\u2019s case, cautiously reported in the journal Nature as still too 'premature' to be declared a cure, comes a decade after\u00a0Timothy Brown, known in medical circles as the 'Berlin patient' was cured by a similar stem cell transplant, galvanizing the field of HIV research and sparking the search for a cure. The London patient, infected with HIV and suffering from Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, received bone marrow cells from a donor who had a malfunctioning CCR5 gene as part of his cancer treatment. The gene is known to create a protein that is crucial for HIV to invade blood cells. -- Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said he will not run for president, opting instead to run for reelection to his Senate seat.\u00a0Sean Sullivan reports: \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve got this limited number of years of life on this planet \u2014 how can I have the biggest impact?\u2019 Merkley said in an interview. \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been weighing. And I\u2019ve reached the conclusion that the biggest impact I can have is here in the Senate.\u2019 \u2026 Merkley, who is one of the Senate\u2019s most liberal members, identified three \u2018mega crises\u2019 he wants to help address: a \u2018crisis of our democracy,\u2019 rooted in voting and campaign finance laws; an \u2018opportunity crisis\u2019 for families to thrive; and \u2018climate chaos.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 The Oregonian is heavily favored to retain his Senate seat, which he has held since 2008.\u00a0He was the only senator to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 Democratic primary, but he said this time around he doesn\u2019t have \u201cany plans to endorse anybody for a good length of time.\u201d -- \u201cI\u2019m not running,\u201d Hillary Clinton told a local TV affiliate in New York, \u201cbut I'm going to keep on working and speaking and standing up for what I believe.\u201d (John Wagner)\u00a0 -- Former attorney general Eric Holder revealed\u00a0in a Post op-ed\u00a0yesterday that he would not run for president. -- The National Security Agency shut down a disputed program established by President George W. Bush\u2019s administration that analyzed the logs of Americans\u2019 domestic calls and texts and that was brought to light by Edward Snowden.\u00a0The New York Times\u2019s Charlie Savage reports: \u201cThe way that intelligence analysts have gained access to bulk records of Americans\u2019 phone calls and texts has evolved, but the purpose has been the same: They analyze social links to hunt for associates of known terrorism suspects. \u2026 Congress ended and replaced the program disclosed by Mr. Snowden with the U.S.A. Freedom Act of 2015, which will expire in December. Security and privacy advocates have been gearing up for a legislative battle over whether to extend or revise the program \u2014 and with what changes, if any. \u2026 \u201cThe disclosure that the program has apparently been shut down for months \u2018changes the entire landscape of the debate,\u2019 said Daniel Schuman, the policy director of Demand Progress, an advocacy group that focuses on civil liberties and government accountability. Since \u2018the sky hasn\u2019t fallen\u2019 without the program, he said, the intelligence community must make the case that reviving it is necessary \u2014 if, indeed, the National Security Agency thinks it is worth the effort to keep trying to make it work.\u00a0The phone records program had never thwarted a terrorist attack, a fact that emerged during the post-Snowden debate.\u201d Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson said he plans to leave the Trump administration by the end of its first term. (Andrew Harnik\/AP)\u00a0 -- Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson said he plans on staying in his post through the end of Trump's first term. Tracy Jan reports: \u201c\u2018I will certainly finish out this term,\u2019 Carson said during his interview with Newsmax. But he added, \u2018I would be interested in returning to the private sector because I think you have just as much influence, maybe more, there.\u2019 \u2026 Carson\u2019s signature EnVision Centers initiative has gone nowhere, having failed to attract much financial support from either the White House or private foundations. Carson had touted the centers as a way to help low-income families access employment, education and health care. But the concept has existed for decades, with limited success in moving families out of poverty,\u00a0HUD staffers told The Post.\u201d Republican Mark Harris listens to testimony during the hearing on voting irregularities in the 9th Congressional District. (Travis Long\/Raleigh\u00a0News & Observer\/AP) GET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)\u00a0has a quick word with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry\u00a0Nadler\u00a0(D-N.Y.) at the Capitol. (Scott Applewhite\/AP) THERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- The House Judiciary Committee opened a sprawling investigation into whether the \u201cpresident and his administration have engaged in obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power\u201d\u00a0by requesting documents from 80 Trump-affiliated people and institutions. Rachael Bade, Karoun Demirjian, Ellen Nakashima and Philip Rucker report: \u201cBut rather than a targeted approach, Monday\u2019s request was broad, reaching current and former campaign staffers, top Trump Organization officials, even documents and communications of the National Rifle Association and the British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The inquiry touched on a wide array of matters, from the president\u2019s business dealings with Russia to the firing of former FBI director James B. Comey to hush payments made to women. \u2026 Those receiving letters from the House Judiciary Committee include the president\u2019s two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; his former personal secretary and senior vice president of the Trump Organization, Rhona Graff; Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization; and former top White House aides Hope Hicks, Sean Spicer and Stephen K. Bannon. Other demands for documents have been directed to institutions including the White House, the Justice Department, the Trump campaign, the Trump presidential transition team and the Trump Organization. \u2026 \u201cThe vast range of the request raised the specter of unfocused inquiries that could last years and involve multiple committees competing for witnesses and documents. \u2026Hours after [House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry] Nadler\u2019s letters went public, for example, the chairmen of three committees asked acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for any documents on Trump\u2019s interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Nadler\u2019s inquiries sought the same information.\u201d -- White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called Nadler\u2019s investigation \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cdisgraceful\u201d in a statement sent to reporters last night: \u201cChairman Nadler and his fellow Democrats have embarked on this fishing expedition because they are terrified that their two-year false narrative of \u2018Russia collusion\u2019 is crumbling,\u201d\u00a0she said. \u201cDemocrats are harassing the President to distract from their radical agenda of making America a socialist country, killing babies after they\u2019re born, and pushing a \u2018green new deal\u2019 that would destroy jobs and bankrupt America. The American people deserve a Congress that works with the President to address serious issues like immigration, healthcare, and infrastructure. \u2026 The Democrats are not after the truth, they are after the President.\u201d -- Attorney General William Barr formally announced, as expected, that he will not recuse himself from overseeing special counsel Bob Mueller\u2019s investigation. Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who intends to leave the department in the coming weeks, continues to be the primary liaison between the special counsel and Barr. \u201cDuring his confirmation hearing in January, Barr refused to say whether he\u2019d recuse himself from overseeing Mueller. He said that he would consult with career Justice Department officials on the recusal matter, but the decision would ultimately be his to make,\u201d\u00a0Bloomberg News\u2019s Chris Strohm reports. -- Jim Comey has an op-ed in The Post today making the case that Barr can abide by DOJ guidelines and still be transparent about Mueller\u2019s investigation. The former FBI director writes: \u201cProviding detailed information about a completed investigation of intense public interest has long been a part of Justice Department practice. \u2026 Republicans are wrong now when they claim Justice Department rules forbid transparency about the completed work of the special counsel. \u2026 It\u2019s always important to consider guidelines and routines. But don\u2019t listen to those who tell you transparency is impossible. Every American should want a Justice Department guided first and always by the public interest. Sometimes transparency is not a hard call.\u201d -- Former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker has left the Justice Department. The Los Angeles Times\u2019s Del Quentin Wilber reports: \u201cJustice Department officials said Whitaker\u2019s last day at the agency was Saturday. He had spent recent weeks working as a senior counselor in the office of the associate attorney general. He has not settled on what to do next in his legal career.\u201d -- Michael Cohen\u2019s lawyers\u00a0raised the possibility of a pardon with the president\u2019s attorneys after federal agents raided Cohen\u2019s properties in April, people familiar with the conversations said.\u00a0The Journal\u2019s Rebecca Ballhaus, Joe Palazzolo and Michael Rothfeld report:\u00a0Cohen\u2019s attorney at the time, Stephen Ryan, discussed the option with \u201cthe president\u2019s lawyers, including Jay Sekulow, Rudy Giuliani and Joanna Hendon, [who] dismissed the idea of a pardon at the time ... But at least one of them, Mr. Giuliani, left open the possibility that the president could grant Mr. Cohen one in the future. \u2026 Mr. Ryan also brought up the subject of a pardon with Alan Futerfas, an outside lawyer for the Trump Organization, and the company\u2019s general counsel, Alan Garten, some of the people familiar with the matter said.\u00a0Mr. Ryan left the impression that if Mr. Cohen couldn\u2019t rely on a pardon, he might cooperate with prosecutors from the Manhattan U.S. attorney\u2019s office investigating Mr. Cohen.\u201d Cohen testified before the House Oversight Committee last week that he had \u201cnever asked for\u201d a pardon from Trump, and there is no indication that Cohen personally asked for a pardon or was aware that a possibility of one was raised:\u00a0\u201cMr. Cohen stands by his testimony before the House Oversight Committee,\u201d\u00a0a spokeswoman for Mr. Cohen said in response to questions for this article.\u00a0 -- Roger Stone\u2019s lawyers told a federal judge it \u201cdid not occur\u201d to them to inform her that a new book may violate a gag order. Spencer S. Hsu and Manuel Roig-Franzia reports: \u201cStone attacks [Mueller] as \u2018crooked\u2019 and accuses \u2018Deep State liberals\u2019 of seeking to silence him in an updated introduction to his book about Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, retitled \u2018The Myth of Russian Collusion.\u2019 Stone was put under a gag order Feb. 21 by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson of Washington, and Stone attorneys led by Bruce S. Rogow told the judge that \u2018not a single word of the book was created\u2019 after that date. Rogow urged Jackson not to find Stone in violation because he could not have known about prohibitions not yet in place. \u2026 Jackson had ordered Stone\u2019s defense attorneys to explain why they did not mention a book whose existence, the judge noted, \u2018was known to the defendant.\u2019\u201d -- Conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi retracted an article that falsely accused the late DNC staffer Seth Rich and his brother of leaking the organization\u2019s emails. Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201cCorsi said in a statement that the allegations he made in his article, which was posted on the Infowars website last March, \u2018were not based upon any independent factual knowledge\u2019 about the Rich brothers. \u2026 \u2018It was not Dr. Corsi\u2019s intent to rely upon inaccurate information, or to cause any suffering to Mr. Rich\u2019s family. To that end, Dr. Corsi retracts the article and apologizes to the Rich family,\u2019 the statement reads. \u2026 [The retraction] represents a victory for the Rich family, which has been battling the conspiracy theory and seeking to hold accountable those who have promoted it.\u201d -- Christopher Steele, the author of the infamous Trump dossier, backed out of his first planned public appearance since the dossier\u2019s publication. Politico\u2019s Ben Schreckinger reports: \u201cSteele, a former MI6 officer, had been scheduled to speak about disinformation next Thursday at the Reawakening the Spirit of Democracy Conference at the George Peabody Library in Baltimore. Steele was scheduled to speak on a panel moderated by Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum. \u2026 Though Steele is listed as a speaker in promotional materials, Applebaum said that he had gotten \u2018cold feet\u2019 last week and canceled. She added that he backed out on advice of counsel.\u201d -- \u201cI feel like I know you,\u201d Trump said\u00a0to D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine (D) during a White House visit. Racine\u00a0is suing the president\u00a0and just last week became the third law enforcement official to subpoena documents from the president's inaugural committee.\u00a0Peter Jamison reports: \"'I feel like I know you as well, Mr. President,'\u00a0Racine replied ... Racine has been among the most aggressive of the multiple Democratic attorneys general confronting the Trump administration. ...\u00a0The exchange between Trump and Racine began when the president was discussing the First Step Act, a bipartisan criminal justice bill that Trump signed in December. After thanking the association [of attorneys general] for its help with the bill, Trump singled out Racine.\" THE #METOO ERA: -- Twenty-one states sued the Trump administration to block changes to a federal family planning program that would divert funding from Planned Parenthood toward faith-based clinics. The two separate lawsuits, probably\u00a0the first of many against the proposed rule, are asking for a court injunction to prevent the president\u2019s proposed changes from taking effect. (Ariana Eunjung Cha) -- A man was charged with trying to set a Planned Parenthood clinic on fire in Missouri. The man allegedly tried to burn down the empty building last month, and the FBI is investigating the attack as a possible hate crime. (AP) -- The Democratic women running for president in 2020 have largely been avoiding Bill Clinton, whom they see as radioactive in the #MeToo era. The AP\u2019s Julie Pace\u2009reports: \u201cSo far, none of the party\u2019s early front-runners has had a formal meeting with Clinton. Nor have the women who are running in the historically diverse primary field.\u00a0 \u201cInstead, Clinton has spoken mostly with male candidates who are considered longshots for the Democratic nomination, including Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Housing secretary Julian Castro and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney. ... Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper was meeting with Hillary Clinton at the couple\u2019s Chappaqua, New York, home when the former president stopped by and sat in on the rest of the meeting. While he doesn\u2019t have much of a relationship with some of the younger White House hopefuls, like Beto O\u2019Rourke, some of his contemporaries are considering running, including former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Vice President Joe Biden. Neither has had a formal meeting with Clinton about the campaign, but they\u2019ve talked politics with him for years. \u201cNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who had been backed by the couple throughout her political career, said Clinton should have resigned from office because of his affair with a White House intern. The former president has tried to publicly brush off the comment, saying Gillibrand \u2026 is \u2018living in a different context.\u2019 But Clinton allies say the couple\u2019s anger at Gillibrand runs deep and their relationship may be irreparable. Other women seeking the Democratic nomination also haven\u2019t met with Clinton, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar spoke with Clinton briefly at last month\u2019s funeral for John Dingell, the retired Democratic congressman.\u201d Flashback: Remember when Al Gore distanced himself from WJC in 2000 because of Monica Lewinsky? Bill's defenders\u00a0note that it didn't turn out well for the then-vice president. -- Trump continues to snub female champions. The president yesterday brought the North Dakota State football team, which won a championship in the NCAA\u2019s secondary division, to the White House for a big celebration on par with what the Clemson football team got for its\u00a0Division I championship. This drew attention to the fact that Trump has not held a single solo event to honor a women\u2019s championship team, in college or professional sports, during his two years in office.\u00a0The last time a lower-level-division college football team scored an invite to the White House was 1995. Clinton's political team brought in the Youngstown State team because it\u00a0wanted to carry Ohio in 1996. In this case, Trump agreed to hold an event for North Dakota State at the personal request of Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.).\u00a0 \u201cThe past two WNBA champions, the Minnesota Lynx in 2017 and the Seattle Storm in 2018, were not invited,\u201d\u00a0David Nakamura reports. \u201cNor was the Notre Dame women\u2019s basketball team, which won the NCAA title in 2018 before a crowd of 19,599 \u2014 more than the number, 17,802, who attended North Dakota\u2019s football title game in January. Two White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. ... \u201cClinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama regularly invited women\u2019s teams. The Lynx made three trips to the White House during the Obama era and the Storm made two. Every women\u2019s college basketball champion was invited to the White House since 1983 before Trump took office, spanning five presidents. Trump invited the South Carolina women\u2019s basketball team, which won the 2017 title, to participate in an event with 18 other men\u2019s and women\u2019s college championship teams in November 2017. But the Gamecocks turned down the visit.\u201d -- The NHL is finally looking to incorporate female referees. The hockey league is alone among the five major professional sports in not\u00a0having female officiates, and it has started reaching out to potential female recruits about participating in the league\u2019s annual scouting event for referees. (Isabelle Khurshudyan) -- Virgin Atlantic will no longer require that female flight attendants wear makeup and skirts. Female cabin crew\u00a0members will now be provided with a pair of pants if they want to wear them instead of what has been the mandatory, standard red skirt. (HuffPost)\u00a0 -- Google\u2019s annual salary study found that more men are being underpaid compared with\u00a0women for the same work, but the search giant acknowledged that the results do not paint a full picture of the pay gap. Workplace experts say that women and minorities often have to overcome biases when they are hired or compete for promotions, which are not necessarily considered when comparing compensation among similar job titles. (New York Times) Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) pauses during a news conference on Capitol Hill. (Salwan Georges\/The Washington Post) DIVIDED AMERICA: -- House Democrats have crafted a resolution condemning anti-Semitism in response to comments from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) suggesting that supporters of Israel are showing \u201callegiance to a foreign country.\u201d Mike DeBonis reports: \u201cThe draft resolution \u2018acknowledges the dangerous consequences of perpetuating anti-Semitic stereotypes\u2019 and \u2018rejects anti-Semitism as hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States.\u2019 But it does not specifically rebuke Omar. Still, chastising her indirectly represents an uncomfortable development for Democrats who have been celebrating Omar, a Somali American immigrant, as a symbol of a historically diverse House freshman class.\u201d -- Omar\u2019s supporters say she has cast a spotlight on the outsize influence of the pro-Israel group AIPAC. The New York Times\u2019s Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports: Questions about AIPAC\u2019s influence \u201cwill grow louder still in the run-up to this month\u2019s annual Aipac policy conference \u2014 a three-day Washington confab that is expected to draw more than 18,000 people, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and leaders of both parties in Congress. To critics, Ms. Omar had a point, even if it was expressed with unfortunate glibness. Aipac\u2019s money does have an outsize influence. \u2026 Today Aipac boasts 17 regional and satellite offices, a gleaming headquarters building near the Capitol and an annual budget so hefty that its chief executive, Howard Kohr, earned more than $1 million in salary and benefits in 2016.\u201d -- Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) has once again attracted criticism for quoting a white nationalist on Twitter. HuffPost\u2019s Christopher Mathias and Roque Planas report: \u201cOn Friday, the congressman quote-tweeted Faith Goldy, a Canadian white nationalist who has publicly recited the \u201814 words,\u2019 a white supremacist mantra, and who once recommended a book that calls for the \u2018elimination of Jews.\u2019 \u2026 King is well aware of who Goldy is. In October, he endorsed Goldy in her longshot run for mayor of Toronto. The endorsement led to widespread condemnation of the congressman.\u201d -- Sacramento police arrested 84 demonstrators and a reporter at a march protesting the decision not to prosecute two cops who fatally shot Stephon Clark, an unarmed black man, last year.\u00a0The reporter, the Sacramento Bee\u2019s Dale Kasler, sat on the ground in handcuffs for about an hour before being released with no charges.\u00a0Tim Elfrink reports: \u201cCritics accused the force of overreacting after days of protests against the ruling that there won\u2019t be charges for the two officers who killed Clark in his grandmother\u2019s backyard after mistaking an iPhone in his hands for a gun. \u2018I\u2019m very disappointed that the protest ended the way it did. I have many questions about what caused the order to disperse and the subsequent arrests,\u2019 Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg said in a statement.\u201d -- A feud between Sen. Rick Scott and Rep. Matt Gaetz, both Republicans from Florida,\u00a0has gone public, putting the two Trump allies at war with each other after Scott doubled down on his criticism of Gaetz\u2019s decision to publish a tweet aimed at Michael Cohen that many saw as witness intimidation.\u00a0Politico\u2019s Marc Caputo and Gary Fineout report: \u201cThe broadside highlighted the toxic feelings between the freewheeling Gaetz and the oft-scripted Scott, who seldom speaks ill of a fellow Florida Republican. Once a semi-secret rivalry, the relationship changed in January after Gaetz helped lead the transition team for Scott\u2019s successor, Gov. Ron DeSantis, and publicly criticized Scott for being disrespectful of the new GOP leader in Tallahassee. \u2026\u00a0 \u201cAt times, the two have been able to put their differences aside in the company of the president, with whom they flew on Air Force One to a Tampa rally for DeSantis in July. While aboard the plane, Gaetz said, Scott was \u2018fumbling through his asks\u2019 of the president after opening a large notebook titled \u2018Issues to Discuss with the President on Air Force One\u2019 that was filled with maps and engineering drawings of Lake Okeechobee and materials concerning other water-related issues important to Florida.\u00a0\u2018The president listens politely for about 30 seconds and then just looks at the governor, looks at me, looks back at the governor and then says, \u2018Isn\u2019t Matt Gaetz great on television?\u2019\u00a0Gaetz recalled. Scott closed the notebook.\u201d -- School officials in California are investigating photos taken at a high school party showing red plastic cups arranged in the shape of a swastika.

(Allyson Chiu) THE IMMIGRATION WARS:\u00a0 -- White House officials know the Senate will pass a rebuke of Trump\u2019s emergency declaration, but they\u2019re trying to limit defections. Erica Werner, Jacqueline Alemany and John Wagner report: \u201cOver the weekend, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) became the fourth Republican to announce he would vote for the disapproval resolution, ensuring its passage ... The Senate vote is expected next week. ... Paul said he held out hope that if GOP opposition in the Senate reached into double digits, Trump might be prevailed upon to change his view. Paul said that for himself, after he had accused President Barack Obama of exceeding his authority on immigration and other issues, it would be hypocritical to consent to Trump doing something similar.\u201d -- More than 70,000 migrants were detained at the border in February, one of the coldest and busiest months there in years. The majority of those detained by U.S. authorities were Central American children and parents. Nick Miroff reports: \u201cDepartment of Homeland Security officials say they expect\u00a0the influx to swell in March and April, months that historically see large increases in illegal crossings as U.S. seasonal labor demand rises. \u2026 The Central American families \u2014 called \u201cgive-ups\u201d because they surrender instead of trying to sneak in \u2014 have left frustrated U.S. agents viewing their own role as little more than the facilitators for the last stage of the migrants\u2019 journey. They are rescuing families with small children from river currents, irrigation canals, medical emergencies and freezing winter temperatures. \u2026\u00a0\u2018The numbers are staggering, and we\u2019re incredibly worried that we will see another huge increase in March,\u2019 said a Homeland Security official.\u201d \u00a0 --\u00a0An Argentinian immigrant who created a documentary about activists who infiltrated the\u00a0for-profit immigration center in Florida where he once was detained has been locked up by ICE again, ahead of the film\u2019s release. Tim Elfrink and Isaac Stanley-Becker report: Claudio Rojas \u201cwon\u2019t be able to catch the film\u2019s South Florida debut, because last week, he was once again arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Rojas\u2019s attorney doesn\u2019t think the timing of his latest detention is a coincidence. \u2018I definitely think it\u2019s retaliation,\u2019 Sandy Pineda told The Washington Post on Sunday. \u2018For them to take this stance and to just arrest him so suddenly for no apparent reason, it\u2019s very unusual.\u2019\u201d -- Gun use among U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u00a0agents is dropping as fewer people cross the border illegally.\u00a0(AP) Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3\u00a0on Monday, after returning to Venezuela. (Fernando Llano\/AP) THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- Amid fears that he might be arrested,\u00a0opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 returned to Venezuela and addressed thousands at an anti-government rally. Mary Beth Sheridan, Rachelle Krygier and Mariana Zu\u00f1iga report: \u201cDiplomats from the United States, Europe and Latin America had gathered at the airport Monday to ensure\u00a0Guaid\u00f3 was not harmed. Officials including Britain\u2019s foreign minister, Jeremy Hunt, and Vice President Pence had publicly warned Maduro against detaining the opposition leader. \u2026 Maduro had said that Guaid\u00f3 would \u2018face justice\u2019 if he returned, and Venezuelans were uncertain until virtually the last minute about when and where he would arrive ... But the opposition leader cleared immigration and went on to lead a packed rally in a plaza in southeastern Caracas, with no interference from police.\u00a0\u2026 \u201cMany appeared relieved and re-energized by Guaid\u00f3\u2019s appearance.\u00a0\u2018The international pressure is causing the government to retreat, and that\u2019s why\u00a0Guaid\u00f3 was able to enter,\u2019 said Giuseppe Di Yorio, 47, a computer engineer at the rally.\u00a0\u2018Now, we must continue to take to the streets.\u2019 \u2026 Maduro did not comment publicly on Guaid\u00f3\u2019s return. On the president\u2019s Twitter account Monday, he urged Venezuelans to enjoy Carnival holidays this week.\u201d \u00a0 -- National security adviser John Bolton is approaching his first anniversary in the post and, in the past year, has proved to be the chief translator of Trump\u2019s unorthodox foreign policy views with an influence over the president that, at times, falls short.\u00a0Karen DeYoung, Greg Jaffe, John Hudson and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cThe contradictions of Bolton\u2019s tenure were apparent in the wake of last week\u2019s collapsed Hanoi summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Bolton dutifully reiterated Trump\u2019s assessment that the summit was a success. But he offered little support for that judgment or the president\u2019s approach beyond saying in an interview with CNN on Sunday that Trump \u2018remains optimistic.\u2019 Asked whether the summit effort was worth it, Bolton took a pass. ...\u00a0 \u201cSome officials said Trump grouses at times that Bolton has pursued an independent foreign policy that isn\u2019t always in line with the administration\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 agenda and has berated him for some of his public remarks on the Middle East and North Korea.\u00a0He has jokingly warned Bolton not to start any wars. But there are no signs that Trump is considering replacing him.\u00a0\u2026 The tension between his conservative views and Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 instincts was clearly apparent in the case of Syria. Trump\u2019s decision to announce a withdrawal came during\u00a0a Dec. 14 telephone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. When Erdogan offered to use his own security forces to clean up Islamic State remnants, allowing the withdrawal of U.S. troops, Trump gladly accepted. Bolton, who listened in on the call, spent the next several days gingerly trying to talk Trump out of an immediate troop departure, to no avail.\u201d -- India is Trump\u2019s next target in his trade wars. The president announced that the country will no longer receive\u00a0benefits under a system set to promote trade from developing countries.\u00a0Nina Masih reports: \u201cIndia is the [Generalized System of Preferences\u2019]\u00a0biggest beneficiary and exports approximately $5.6 billion in goods to the United States under the program, including motor vehicle parts, precious-metal jewelry and insulated cables. \u2026 India\u2019s response so far has been muted. Indian Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan said the decision would not have a \u2018significant impact\u2019 on exports, according to news agency Asian News International. The \u2018economic value of GSP benefits are very moderate,\u2019 he said. Just over 10 percent of India\u2019s current exports to the United States actually benefit from the program.\u201d\u00a0 -- The U.S. tightened its Cuban embargo, reversing two decades of policy toward\u00a0the island and allowing lawsuits by American citizens against Cuban government entities that\u00a0trafficked in property confiscated six decades ago by Fidel Castro\u2019s government.\u00a0Karen DeYoung reports: \u201cSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that the administration was lifting a prohibition against such suits, as long as they were filed against one of about 200 companies and businesses in which the Cuban security services have a financial interest. Last year, U.S. companies and travelers were prohibited from conducting any business with the listed Cuban entities.\u201d -- Germany adopted a controversial measure to turn back immigrants at its borders last year, almost causing the collapse of Angela Merkel\u2019s government. The program has, so far, stopped only 11 people from entering the country. From the Telegraph\u2019s Justin Huggler: \u201cUnder a compromise deal, [Interior Minister Horst]\u00a0Seehofer negotiated agreements with Austria, Greece and Spain \u2014 three of the main countries affected \u2014 to take back migrants turned away at the border.\u00a0 Now it appears the measures have been strikingly ineffective at limiting migrant numbers. According to the newly released figures, since they were introduced nine migrants have been returned to Greece, two to Spain, and none to Austria.\u201d -- A federal judge declined to fast-track a lawsuit brought by the family of an Alabama woman\u00a0who joined the Islamic State\u00a0and\u00a0now wants to return home. The lawsuit alleges that the\u00a0Trump administration unlawfully denied Hoda Muthana\u2019s\u00a0request to return to America. Spencer S. Hsu and Carol Morello report: \u201cU.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton of Washington rejected an emergency motion to recognize the U.S. citizenship claim of Hoda Muthana, saying her family\u2019s attorneys had not proved she would be \u2018irreparably harmed\u2019 by remaining in a refu\u00adgee camp with her 18-month-old son while litigation continued at a normal pace. \u2026 While she was living in the self-declared caliphate in Syria, Hoda Muthana helped spread Islamic State propaganda on social media and called for the death of Americans.\u201d -- Chinese hackers targeted at least 27 American universities in the chase for maritime military secrets, hitting among them the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Washington. From the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Dustin Volz: \u201cThe majority of the universities targeted either house research hubs focused on undersea technology or have faculty on staff with extensive experience in a relevant field, and nearly all have links to a Massachusetts oceanographic institute that also was likely compromised in the cyber campaign, iDefense said. Some have been awarded contracts by the Navy. Others, including Sahmyook University in South Korea, appeared to be targeted due to their proximity to China, and relevance to the South China Sea, the analysts said. \u2026 The Chinese hacking group, which multiple security firms and officials have linked to Beijing, is the same one that has been linked to breaches of Navy contractors and subcontractors that have resulted in the theft of sensitive military information, such as submarine missile plans and ship-maintenance data.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 -- Meanwhile,\u00a0China blocked Internet searches abroad as President Xi Jinping prepares to deliver a major speech at the National People\u2019s Congress. The Telegraph\u2019s Sophia Yan reports: \u201cAnalysts suggest China is keen to control the narrative from the rubber stamp parliament more than ever as President Xi Jinping faces one of his toughest years in office due to a slowing economy, a damaging trade war with the US and growing discontent about investment abroad. \u2026 For Beijing, keeping negative or critical news at bay, and having even greater control than usual over the messaging, is a key priority ahead of major events. \u2026 Although they are technically illegal, Virtual Private Networks are commonly used to sidestep the Great Firewall, allowing internet users inside China, including foreign firms to see beyond state-sanctioned content.\u201d Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) speaks during the National Governors Association 2019 winter meeting in Washington. (Jose Luis Magana\/AP) MORE 2020: -- Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) visited Iowa again but gave no clear signal on whether he would challenge Trump for the GOP nomination. Sean Sullivan reports: \u201cHe said he was here to attend to National Governors Association business, not lay the groundwork for a campaign. \u2018It currently makes no sense, with a president that has the kind of approval rating that he does in his own party,\u2019 Hogan said in an interview. \u2018Having said that, I\u2019ve said things can change, and we don\u2019t know what it might look like a few months from now.\u2019 Variables such as the outcome of [Mueller\u2019s] probe, Democratic talk of impeachment and the president\u2019s fluctuating political standing are all potential factors in his decision, Hogan acknowledged. In the meantime, he\u2019s taking things slowly.\u201d -- Several top donors have told 2020 Democrats they are waiting to see whether former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe runs before committing to a candidate. CNN\u2019s Dan Merica reports: \u201cMcAuliffe has deep ties to the Democratic donor community after years of raising money for Bill and Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and his two campaigns for governor of Virginia. He has publicly said he will decide whether to run for president in the next month, but as he waits, a number of prolific Democratic donors are sitting on the sidelines.\u201d -- Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper\u2019s coziness with the oil and gas industry could become a challenge as he seeks the Democratic nomination. The LA Times\u2019s Eli Stokols reports: \u201cSome Colorado Republicans were known to joke during Hickenlooper\u2019s tenure that he was the best governor their party ever had because of his conservative positions on some issues. \u2026 Hickenlooper once drank fracking fluid in a congressional hearing to demonstrate that it\u2019s safe, an element of his biography that might not play well with progressive primary voters.\u201d -- Chuck Schumer met with MJ\u00a0Hegar over the weekend to discuss challenging Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) next year. HuffPost\u2019s Dana Liebelson reports: \u201cHegar is a tattooed, motorcycle-riding, Purple Heart recipient whose personal story \u2014 and a viral campaign ad about the challenges she\u2019s overcome\u2014 helped her mount a competitive Democratic challenge last year against Republican Rep. John Carter in Central Texas\u2019 31st Congressional District. She lost by about 3 percentage points, but in 2016, Carter won re-election by more than 20 points.\u201d -- Former Kansas City Chiefs player Dave Lindstrom is considering a Senate bid after Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) announced his retirement. From the Kansas City Star\u2019s Bryan Lowry: \u201cLindstrom, an Overland Park Republican, currently serves as board chairman for the Kansas Turnpike Authority and as a member of Johnson County Community College\u2019s Board of Trustees. He said he would decide within the next 90 days whether to join the Senate race in Kansas.\u201d -- Longtime New York GOP Chairman Ed Cox is running for another term despite the party\u2019s widespread losses across the state last year. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jimmy Vielkind reports: \u201cDissatisfaction with Mr. Cox has simmered among county chairs and elected officials since the midterm elections. They say the GOP needs to reboot, and that Mr. Cox has lost touch with the party base. As elsewhere, Mr. Trump\u2019s election laid bare existing divisions between moderate and conservative Republicans in New York. Mr. Cox, the son-in-law of former President Richard Nixon, has long been viewed warily by Mr. Trump\u2019s more conservative supporters.\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Lawyer Keith Davidson, who represented Stormy Daniels when she made her deal with Michael Cohen, reacted to the House Judiciary Committee's document request: Lawyer George Conway, who is married to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, expressed alarm over the New Yorker report on Trump's relationship with Fox News: From a Democratic congressman: From a former Fox News contributor: The House Judiciary Committee chairman accused one of Trump's congressional allies of anti-Semitism after he used a dollar sign to spell the name of billionaire activist Tom Steyer, whose father was Jewish: Sen.

But more than a week after authorities announced that a sprawling web of investigations into massage parlors across this region had found women performing sex acts for money, officials have not yet filed any trafficking charges. \u2026 And while current and former law enforcement officials and advocates for victims say they suspect human trafficking was part of what occurred in the Florida parlors, they also acknowledge it probably will be difficult to prove.\u201d -- \u201cEvery Michael Jackson song sounds different today,\u201d by Chris Richards: \u201cHow do we make the most famous entertainer our world has ever known instantly and permanently disappear? We don\u2019t. We can\u2019t. \u2026 And whether or not you want to listen to another Michael Jackson song in your life, it\u2019s not really up to you. There will still be house parties, and wedding receptions, and karaoke contests, and barbecues, and Friday nights on dance floors where \u2018Billie Jean\u2019 makes the room spin. \u2026 For the rest of us, every Michael Jackson song sounds different today. \u2026 Now, the evidence has never been more damning that he preyed on the vulnerable behind closed doors. Our listening has to change again.\u201d -- The Atlantic, \u201cThe secrets that might be hiding in the Vatican\u2019s archives,\u201d by David I. Kertzer: \u201cFrancis\u2019s opening of the Pius XII archives makes available not only the 17 million pages of documents in the central Vatican archives, but many other materials in other Church archives. Not least of these are the archives of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (formerly known as the Holy Office of the Inquisition) and the central archives of the Jesuit order. They, too, are likely to have much that is new to tell us. Demands that the Vatican open its archives for the war years began to be heard in 1963, following the premiere in Germany of Rolf Hochhuth\u2019s play, The Deputy. It portrayed a coldhearted Pius XII spurning all pleas to condemn the slaughter of the Jews, concerned only with protecting the institutional interests of the Church. In an effort to respond to the critics, the Holy See commissioned four Jesuits to plow through the archives and publish a selection of documents shedding light on the controversy. The result, over a 16-year period beginning in 1965, was 12 thick volumes containing thousands of documents. Although skeptics suspected the Jesuit editors of selecting out documents unflattering to the Church, the volumes are far from a simple whitewash of this troubled history.\u201d HOT ON THE LEFT: \u201cBig-dollar donors, including Donald Trump, fueled Kamala Harris\u2019 political rise in California,\u201d from the Sacramento Bee: \u201cIn 2011 and again in 2013, Trump donated a total of $6,000 to Harris\u2019 campaign for California attorney general. His daughter, Ivanka, also gave Harris $2,000 in 2014. The first donation from Trump, for $5,000 in September 2011, came months after he had begun\u00a0popping up on cable news\u00a0promoting [birtherism] \u2026 Harris campaign spokesman Ian Sams [said that] Harris donated the $6,000 Trump had contributed to a non-profit that advocates for civil and human rights for Central Americans.

Council member Jack Evans\u2019s use of his government email to send business proposals to potential employers and offers to use his connections as an elected official has landed him in hot water.\u00a0Fenit Nirappil, Steve Thompson and Peter Jamison report: \u201c\u2018I believe our code of conduct provides that a member should not use council resources for personal purposes, for personal gain,' Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said. 'On the face of it, that appears to be exactly what happened.' ...\u00a0Mendelson said that the D.C. Council would also respond in some way but that he wanted to first consult with Evans and other council members, as well as the council\u2019s lawyer, with whom he met Monday. ...\u00a0The D.C. Council has a variety of ways to punish one of its own, including a vote of reprimand or censure, forming a special committee to investigate a lawmaker, and removal of committee assignments.\"\u00a0 -- About half of Marylanders\u00a0oppose a bill navigating the state's General Assembly that would allow\u00a0gender-neutral driver\u2019s licenses. Ovetta\u00a0Wiggins reports: \u201c51 percent of Marylander voters said they do not favor giving drivers the option to identify as 'unspecified' on their licenses. The legislation approved by the Senate last month would require the state Motor Vehicle Administration to issue licenses or identification cards that show an 'M' for male drivers, an 'F'\u00a0for female drivers and an 'X'\u00a0for drivers who don\u2019t identify with a specific gender. ...\u00a0The poll findings, much like the 32-to-14 vote in the Senate last month, largely fall along partisan lines. Sixty percent of registered Democrats and 36 percent of unaffiliated voters favor gender-neutral licenses. Twelve percent of Republicans said they support the idea.\u201d\u00a0 -- While addressing the multiple scandals surrounding his state\u2019s executive office, Virginia\u00a0Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D) said he demanded the resignation of Gov. Ralph Northam\u00a0(D)\u00a0not because the governor once wore blackface but because he flip-flopped on the subject so much it showed his inability to lead. Laura Vozzella reports: \u201cBreaking a month of silence since acknowledging that he, too, had dressed in blackface as a young man, Herring took pains to differentiate his situation from Northam\u2019s. \u2026 \u2018It was really about the public trust. I would hold myself to the same standard,\u2019\u00a0[he said.] \u2026 The attorney general said that after Northam\u2019s revelations, he \u2018agonized\u2019 about whether to disclose that he had dressed in blackface for a party as a 19-year-old student at the University of Virginia. \u2026 Herring, who\u00a0announced\u00a0in December his intention to run for governor in 2021, declined to say whether he will still run.\u201d The sexual assault accusations made against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax\u00a0(D), Herring said, are \u201cdifferent but a very difficult situation,\u201d Herring said: \u201cThe women who say they were sexually assaulted by the lieutenant governor \u2018deserve to be heard; they deserve respect,\u2019 he said. \u2018What needs to happen is some type of impartial situation so we can get to the facts,\u2019 he said. \u2018In the current situation, it\u2019s hard to see how that takes place.

The gathering,\u00a0which cost the inaugural committee roughly $8,000 a person, was one of the most opulent events of the five-day inaugural celebration\u2014 yet it was not designed to showcase the new president, who decided to attend at the last minute, according to internal documents and people familiar with the planning. Dubbed the Chairman\u2019s Global Dinner, it was the brainchild of billionaire Thomas J. Barrack Jr., Trump\u2019s close friend and his inaugural committee chairman, who conceived of the night as a glittery overture to a diplomatic corps anxious about the change in Washington. Paid for by donors to the inaugural committee, the event put Barrack\u2019s style of global networking on display and gave foreign guests an unparalleled chance to mingle with the incoming vice president, other members of the new administration and lawmakers. The dinner serves as an extravagant symbol of Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities, which involved record fundraising, lavish spending and a large concentration of foreign guests. Now, state, federal and congressional investigators are scrutinizing those issues as part of five inquiries of activities related to the inaugural committee. Barrack, a Los Angeles-based investor, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. But the investigations have\u00a0put the longtime Trump friend in the spotlight and raised questions about\u00a0oversight of the committee he helmed, an independent nonprofit organization that collected money from private donors for the January 2017 festivities. The scope of the various inquiries remains unknown. But federal prosecutors in New York issued a\u00a0wide-ranging subpoena last month to the inaugural committee indicating that they are investigating possible conspiracy, money-laundering and false statements. The subpoena sought all information related to the committee\u2019s donors and vendors, as well as any information related to foreign contributors. A separate federal investigation already has revealed that illegal foreign money was funneled into the inaugural committee. Last year, political consultant W. Samuel Patten admitted that he steered\u00a0a donation from a Ukrainian politician to the\u00a0committee through an American straw donor. The Ukrainian subsequently attended the inauguration, according to prosecutors in Washington. Patten agreed to assist the investigation as part of a plea deal. Separately, the attorneys general of\u00a0Washington, D.C., and New Jersey have opened their own inquires into whether the committee violated nonprofit rules.\u00a0 And\u00a0the House Judiciary Committee last week asked Barrack, along with 80 other individuals and entities, for documents as part of a broad investigation of Trump\u2019s presidency. The request to him sought materials related to any payments to the inaugural committee by foreign governments, as well as other topics.\u00a0 Barrack, 71, said he has provided information to investigators and will continue to do so. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to parry and thrust on the reporting of unsubstantiated allegations because I have great respect for our nation\u2019s investigatory process at all levels of government \u2014 Federal, Congressional or otherwise,\u201d he said in a statement to The Washington Post. \u201cI intend to continue to cooperate fully with relevant investigators who I am confident will appropriately establish the true facts and will do so in the venue in which they should be established.\u201d He declined to comment further. Details about the invitation-only Chairman\u2019s Global Dinner, Barrack\u2019s signature event of the week, have been largely out of public view. An examination of the event based on internal documents and attendees provides a window into how Trump\u2019s upstart victory quickly drew influential figures eager to shape the new administration. \u00a0When Barrack accepted Trump\u2019s request to oversee the inaugural event, he did so at a time when he was trying to bring the president closer in line with his thinking on the Middle East, according to emails he sent\u00a0during the campaign. The grandson of a Christian emigre from what was once Syria and is now Lebanon, Barrack has long been Trump\u2019s closest friend of Arab American ancestry. An Arabic speaker, he began conducting business deals in the Middle East in 1972. His investment company, Colony Capital,\u00a0currently\u00a0receives \u201cless than 10\u00a0percent of [its] investor base,\u201d\u00a0from the region,\u00a0 spokesman Owen Blicksilver said. Barrack met Trump in 1987, when he helped arrange the sale of part of a department store chain to the New York real estate mogul. The following year, Barrack negotiated the deal in which Trump bought New York City\u2019s Plaza Hotel for a price Trump said publicly he could \u201cnever justify.\u201d The two remained close for decades, and Barrack was among the most vociferous supporters of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential bid\u00a0and\u00a0his\u00a0biggest fundraiser. When Trump called for a \u201ccomplete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d and began espousing \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric on the campaign trail, Barrack\u2019s friends and contacts in the Middle East expressed alarm. Yousef al-Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United States and a longtime friend who had once introduced Barrack to a potential investor, wrote in an August 2016 email that \u201cconfusion about your friend donald trump is VERY high,\u201d according to copies obtained by The Post. Barrack sought to reassure him. Trump \u201cis the king of hyperbole and is searching through radical popularism [sic] to creating a dialogue in our region!\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cWe can turn him to prudence \u2014 he needs a few really smart Arab minds to whom he can confer.\u201d\u00a0 Otaiba declined to comment. A few months later, after Trump won the election, Barrack agreed to be the chairman of his inaugural committee \u2014 and began planning elaborate events. Unlike campaign committees, the inaugural committee as a nonprofit organization could accept unlimited sums from individuals and corporations. Although presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama limited some donations at their first inaugurations, the Trump committee set no limits. Free from restrictions,\u00a0the 2017\u00a0committee hauled in $107\u00a0million, according to its public filings \u2014 more than twice the $53\u00a0million raised for\u00a0Obama\u2019s 2009 inaugural events.\u00a0 Much of it came from some of the nation\u2019s wealthiest families and largest corporations, including AT&T;, Bank of America and Boeing, which were among the contributors that gave $1\u00a0million or more,\u00a0according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.\u00a0 The biggest donors received perks that included tickets to a leadership luncheon with Cabinet nominees and members of Congress,\u00a0a dinner held by incoming Vice President Pence, a candlelight dinner\u00a0with Trump, the inaugural concert and the official Inaugural Ball. Access to the Chairman\u2019s Global Dinner was by invitation only, determined by Barrack and his associates, according to people familiar with the planning. And, unlike some events that week, this one was not broadcast to the public. Some of Trump\u2019s advisers, such as chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon,\u00a0objected to\u00a0events such as Barrack\u2019s dinner, saying\u00a0they rewarded big donors at the expense of the populist message espoused during the campaign,\u00a0according to people familiar with the discussions. But Trump signed off, instructing Barrack to throw the most spectacular inaugural event in history, an official said.\u00a0 Bannon declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Barrack directed details of the night down to the type of wine (a donation of sauvignon blanc and merlot from his California vineyard), the music (a playlist created for the 50th birthday of casino mogul Steve Wynn\u2019s wife), and the gray-and-black brocade tablecloths.\u00a0 He oversaw the guest list, a quarter of which were his invitees, including his business associates and foreign contacts, according to internal documents and people familiar with the details.\u00a0 Of the roughly 600 invitees, 140 were foreign diplomats, according to a copy of the final invitation list obtained by The Post.\u00a0 The focus of the night was a notable departure from other inaugural events, which are typically celebrations by party leaders and financiers. \u201cIt was very strange. I remember thinking, \u2018Okay, who\u2019s paying for this? And why?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said one guest who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigations, adding: \u201cWhy have such a lavish event for the diplomatic corps?\u201d Associates of Barrack said the goal was to soothe jittery foreign diplomats and send a message that the new administration would value those relationships. \u201cHosting an event specifically dedicated to the D.C.-based global diplomatic community was particularly important,\u201d said Blicksilver, the Barrack spokesman, adding: \u201cThe intention of the dinner was to give the best foot forward of a newly elected and not well understood president to Washington\u2019s diplomatic community \u2014 certainly a laudable goal.\u201d An ambassador from the Middle East, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigations, said Barrack told him that \u201cwe looked into this and realized there has never been an event [like this] for the diplomatic corps. It was a no-brainer.\u201d\u00a0 Providing entertainment for the event was a challenge. Many performers who didn\u2019t want to appear at the Trump event turned down the invitation to do so,\u00a0said several people familiar with the planning.\u00a0 In the end,\u00a0Wynn, a longtime Trump friend who later was named finance chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC),\u00a0tapped\u00a0the house act that had just wrapped up a two-year run at one of his Las Vegas hotels, a Broadway-quality revue of famous show tunes by professional singers and dancers known as Steve Wynn\u2019s ShowStoppers. Wynn Resorts, his Las Vegas company, paid $729,217\u00a0to help bring the show to Washington, according to the inaugural committee\u2019s public filings.\u00a0An attorney for Wynn declined to comment. The committee\u00a0spent $2.7\u00a0million for a custom stage and for the evening\u2019s sound and light production, according to invoices and people familiar with the event. By late afternoon on Jan. 17, a stream of limousines and buses began pulling up in front of\u00a0Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium, dropping off men in tuxedos and women in glittering dresses.\u00a0 Hours before the dinner, event planners learned that Trump would fly to Washington on his jet to attend, setting off a scramble to rearrange the seating, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The president-elect\u00a0arrived after the event had begun, making his way to the front and taking a seat with Barrack,\u00a0attendees said. \u201cI remember the band telling me that he was seated at a table at the front of the stage and he actually watched them perform,\u201d said Tony Conway, the manager of\u00a0the group\u00a0Alabama. He said band members had been told earlier that they should not expect to see\u00a0Trump. At some point, Trump took the stage, wearing a dark blue suit and tie. \u201cOne hundred and forty-seven diplomats and ambassadors, never been done before, never had that,\u201d\u00a0he said, according to a\u00a0two-minute video of his remarks\u00a0posted by the Daily Mail. Trump pointed to Rex Tillerson, his nominee to be secretary of state, and said, \u201cHe\u2019s going to be so incredible.\u201d Trump would fire Tillerson 14 months later. Mingling with the diplomatic visitors were many invitees who had connections to Barrack. According to the list, 135 tickets were reserved for guests of the chairman. They included incoming Cabinet officials, members of Barrack\u2019s family, corporate employees and foreign\u00a0associates. Mohamed Alabbar, the chief executive of a Dubai-based real estate company that built the world\u2019s tallest building, was invited as Barrack\u2019s guest, assigned with his wife to Table 20, along with the incoming Energy Secretary Rick Perry, internal documents show. In an interview with CNN in June 2016, Barrack called Alabbar, \u201ca good friend\u201d who was \u201cone of the brightest young Arabs I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d An Alabbar spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Another Barrack guest was assigned to Table 42: Rashid Al Malik, the chairman of Hayah Holdings, a real estate company in the United Arab Emirates that partnered with Barrack on a 2014 bid\u00a0to redevelop the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum . The deal never was consummated. Al Malik could not be reached tocomment. Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates ambassador who had emailed with Barrack, was also among the guests \u2014\u00a0assigned to\u00a0a table\u00a0with the Israeli ambassador, incoming deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland and incoming Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the guest list\u00a0shows.\u00a0 Some in the room would later become embroiled in controversy because of their interactions with the administration. Two of the RNC\u2019s biggest fundraisers were in attendance: Wynn and Elliott Broidy, a Los Angeles-based venture capitalist.\u00a0Both men were later\u00a0linked to an effort to push the Trump administration to extradite a Chinese dissident to his home country, a move sought by Chinese President Xi Jinping,\u00a0The Post has reported.\u00a0The Justice Department has investigated whether Broidy sought to sell access to the Trump administration, including in connection to an investigation of a Malaysian development fund, and has subpoenaed Wynn for related records. Wynn, who stepped down from his positions at his company last year amid sexual harassment reports, is cooperating with the inquiry, The Post\u00a0reported last year. An attorney for Broidy previously told The Post that Broidy was never \u201ccompensated by any foreign government for any interaction with the United States Government.\u201d Broidy and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment about the inauguration. Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who was assigned to Table 4 with Otaiba, gave $5\u00a0million for the inauguration, more than any other donor. Many of his top goals have been achieved under the Trump administration, including the transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Last year, the Justice Department released a legal opinion that further restricted Internet gambling, a move Adelson had long sought. Congressional Democrats and several state attorneys general are\u00a0now seeking\u00a0information\u00a0about whether Adelson played a role\u00a0shaping\u00a0the opinion.\u00a0 A spokesman for Adelson declined to comment. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors in Manhattan have asked the inaugural committee to produce all documents related to Imaad Zuberi, a venture capitalist from California who had been a major Democratic donor until he\u00a0gave $900,000 to\u00a0the committee\u00a0in late 2016.\u00a0 The guest list shows that Zuberi was assigned to sit at Table 19, along with the ambassador from Cameroon and Howard Lorber, a New York real estate executive and longtime Trump friend. Zuberi, who has denied any wrongdoing,\u00a0told The Post last month that at the time, he was trying to start a real estate fund in New York, including soliciting investment from Qatar, and had attended the inaugural dinner eager to network with Trump\u2019s associates. He declined to comment on the event.\u00a0 A Lorber spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was sentenced this month to 7\u00bd years in prison for financial crimes related to his work as an international consultant, was also in attendance and working the room, according to another attendee. Barrack has known Manafort for years and recommended that Trump hire him\u00a0in 2016. Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, was assigned to be seated with Wadie Habboush, a Washington lawyer whose father, R.W. Habboush, donated $666,000 to the inauguration, according to records. Wadie Habboush, who at the time worked with his father in energy consulting, was listed in internal documents as a guest of \u201cDJT.\u201d It is unclear whether the designation referred to Trump or his son\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump Jr. Neither Habboush responded to requests for comment. An attorney for Trump Jr. declined to comment. Priebus also declined to comment. A few weeks after the inauguration, Wadie Habboush arrived unannounced to see National Security Council officials\u00a0at the White House with Gentry Beach, a Texas businessman who is a college friend of Trump Jr., according to two people familiar with the event. The two\u00a0told NSC staff members that they were business partners of the president\u2019s son and wanted to pitch a plan to build new relations between the United States and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s socialist leader. Mic and Politico Magazine first reported the episode. Habboush showed the staff members a photo of himself standing with Maduro, and the two men placed a call from the hallway to the country\u2019s foreign minister, the people said.\u00a0 NSC staff members reported the visit to White House lawyers,\u00a0concerned that they were promoting a proposal in their own interests, the people familiar with the episode said.\u00a0\u00a0 In an email, Beach said he has \u201cnever been involved in any talks to help the country of Venezuela, lift sanctions or otherwise.\u201d He did not answer other questions about the episode. The ultimate cost of the dinner: at least $4.3\u00a0million,\u00a0according to\u00a0people familiar with the budget. The money being spent on inaugural events sparked tension inside the committee \u2014 particularly around the Chairman\u2019s Global Dinner, whose expenses included thousands of dollars just to furnish the Green Room, according to internal emails reviewed by The Post. \u201cThe costs are way too high. .\u2009.\u2009. Oscars, Grammy\u2019s, VMA\u2019s etc doesn\u2019t even cost this much for set build even during crunch time,\u201d one person who worked on the inauguration wrote, referring to elaborate Hollywood productions such as the Video Music Awards. Those who had been involved in past inaugurations said they could not recall any event comparable to the chairman\u2019s dinner during the Bush or Obama festivities and questioned its purpose. \u201cThis just doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d said Greg Jenkins, who served executive director of Bush\u2019s inauguration in 2005. \u201cCobbling together something where one could reasonably conclude, correctly or incorrectly, that one of the purposes is to impress your friends and potential business interests with your connections and your ability to put them in front of diplomats and Cabinet members .\u2009.\u2009. it just invites criticism.\u201d He said he was skeptical of the idea that Trump needed to be introduced to diplomats. \u201cThe man had international interests. He\u2019s been around the world,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere are plenty of opportunities for that to happen during the administration. You don\u2019t need to hold a fancy dinner to do that.\u201d A business partner of Barrack who attended the dinner defended his decision to put on the event. \u201cTom is well known as a vocal globalist and has based his business and personal reputation on building long lines with varying cultures and countries around the world,\u201d said the partner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. \u201cIt was Tom\u2019s way of acknowledging their importance without any official visibility from the president and also allowed the president to choose to attend or not.\u201d Barrack declined to comment beyond his written statement. People familiar with the situation said that around the time of the\u00a0inauguration,\u00a0he was being vetted for a job as a Middle East envoy. Barrack told The Post in\u00a0September\u00a02017 that Trump offered to give him a senior administration position, noting his work as a prolific campaign fundraiser and running the inauguration. \u201cYeah, I raised the most money for him,\u201d Barrack said. \u201cThe inauguration in itself was over $100 million that we had to raise from scratch. So of course he said, \u2018Would you like Treasury? What would you like to do?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Barrack said he decided to remain in private business. Days before the dinner, Barrack had completed a merger between his investment company, Colony Capital, and\u00a0NorthStar, which managed a variety of assets,\u00a0to create\u00a0a new firm called\u00a0Colony NorthStar. He chose as a consultant Rick Gates, who had been Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager and Barrack\u2019s deputy on the inaugural committee. Two years later, Gates\u00a0pleaded guilty to conspiracy and lying to the FBI. Since then, he has been cooperating with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.\u00a0 Gates was closely involved in planning the dinner, according to internal documents. Weeks after the inauguration, he wrote a strategic plan for Barrack\u2019s firm, recommending that Colony NorthStar take advantage of its relationships with the incoming administration and foreign officials.\u00a0 The eight-page internal memo, first reported by ProPublica, proposed\u00a0that the company\u2019s new Washington presence could be used to \u201cexpand Colony NorthStar\u2019s global footprint and build a bridge to where government and business intersect globally.\u201d \u201cThe key is to strategically cultivate domestic and international relationships while avoiding any appearance of lobbying,\u201d the memo said. A Barrack spokesman said that Gates\u2019s proposal was never acted upon and that Barrack never saw it.\u00a0An attorney for Gates declined to comment. Since the inauguration, Barrack\u2019s company,\u00a0now known again as Colony Capital, has plummeted in value, with its share price dropping from $13.82 in January 2017 to $5.32 this week, a drop the company has attributed to problems with the merger.\u00a0\u00a0 Last month, Barrack was in Abu Dhabi at a Milken Institute meeting when he defended Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. U.S. intelligence officials have said that the killing, at the Saudi Embassy in Istanbul in October, was directed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Bin Salman has denied responsibility. \u201cWhatever happened in Saudi Arabia, the atrocities in America are equal, or worse,\u201d Barrack said. He\u00a0apologized the next day. Barrack\u2019s relationship with Trump, meanwhile, has suffered. His hopes of brokering Middle East policies were outstripped by the influence of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Barrack\u00a0told The Post in 2017 that he had many concerns about Trump\u2019s tone and policies, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s better than this.\u201d The two men once spoke regularly, according to people familiar with their relationship. But now, they said, their conversations are sporadic.","10":"Days ahead of his second summit with Kim Jong Un, President Trump is redefining success in his bid to force North Korea to relinquish its nuclear program, tamping down public expectations amid evidence that Pyongyang has done little to curb its weapons production. Trump is hopeful that his bilateral meetings with Kim this week in Hanoi will re-create the international media spectacle of their historic first summit in Singapore last summer \u2014 and perhaps distract from mounting domestic political turmoil. But wide gaps remain between U.S. and North Korean negotiators, who have yet to agree on a basic definition of what \u201cdenuclearization\u201d means to both sides, according to U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks. Senior Trump aides have privately expressed skepticism over the prospects that a deal can be reached to significantly advance the largely symbolic agreement announced in Singapore. Some fear that Trump could feel pressure to make a major concession to Kim during face-to-face talks, including a one-on-one session, in hopes of securing a reciprocal commitment he can herald as a political victory. In recent days, Trump has sought to create the conditions to declare the summit a success regardless of the outcome. Having once demanded that the North give up its weapons quickly, Trump said last week he is in \u201cno rush\u201d as long as the regime maintains a testing moratorium on nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles that has been in place since November\u00a02017. \u201cI have no pressing timetable,\u201d he said, adding that he expects his meeting with Kim in Hanoi won\u2019t be their last. Trump has portrayed the ratcheting down of tensions with North Korea \u2014 after his \u201cfire and fury\u201d rhetoric helped escalate the situation following provocative missile tests by Kim in 2017 \u2014 as evidence of his ability to tackle seemingly intractable foreign policy issues that bedeviled his predecessors. But it\u2019s a risky strategy both politically and from a national security perspective \u2014 and one that rests on the shaky proposition that the warm feelings expressed by Trump and Kim, as well as the lack of provocative actions by North Korea, can last much longer even if negotiations fail to deliver more than the broad outlines of the agreement reached in Singapore. Kim is likely to be well versed in how the summit plays into Trump\u2019s domestic political imperatives. Their meeting Thursday will take place hours after Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, is scheduled to appear on Capitol Hill in a public hearing to testify about his dealings with the president, including a campaign finance violation. Trump will be eager to divert attention, and some foreign policy experts said that could provide incentives for the president to pursue a splashy announcement \u2014 such as a declaration to formally end the Korean War, which has been suspended in an armistice since 1953 \u2014 that includes no concrete steps toward curbing production of fissile materials for North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons. At a recent news conference in the Rose Garden, Trump said that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize and complained that he has not gotten sufficient credit from the media for his efforts on North Korea. Yet U.S. intelligence officials testified to Congress last month that it remains unlikely Kim would fully dismantle his arsenal, and some Trump aides, including national security adviser John Bolton, believe the North Koreans cannot be trusted and the talks are destined to fail. \u201cTalking is not progress; it\u2019s a means to an end,\u201d said Bruce Klingner, a former CIA analyst on Northeast Asia whose recent analysis for the conservative Heritage Foundation found \u201cno tangible progress\u201d toward denuclearization since Singapore. \u201cTrump seems to now define them not testing as a success. That\u2019s not a success,\u201d Klingner added, noting that Pyongyang had testing moratoriums for longer stretches during previous U.S. administrations. \u201cIf there\u2019s no progress, then at what point does the U.S. say, \u2018Look, they\u2019re stringing us along?\u2019\u201d U.S. negotiators, who are in Hanoi for last-minute talks with their North Korean counterparts ahead of Trump\u2019s arrival late Tuesday, said they are seeking a detailed road map for complete and verifiable denuclearization, while Pyongyang is aiming for relief from punishing international economic sanctions. Frustrated at the lack of progress in lower-level negotiations since Singapore, the U.S. team has signaled that it is backing off unilateral demands and is willing to consider something closer to the \u201cstep-for-step\u201d process, sought by Pyongyang, in which both sides make concessions along the way. Stephen E. Biegun, the U.S. special envoy to North Korea, reiterated in a speech at Stanford University last month that the United States will not lift sanctions until denuclearization is complete. But he added that his team is seeking to resolve the question of sequencing \u2014 \u201cwhat am I going to do, what are you going to do, and who\u2019s going to act first?\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t say we won\u2019t do anything until you do everything,\u201d Biegun said. Biegun said he does not expect Pyongyang to use the summit to provide an inventory of its nuclear warheads, thought by U.S. intelligence agencies to number about 65, and production facilities \u2014 even though others in the administration had suggested such an accounting would be a prerequisite. But he emphasized that Kim told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last fall that the North would be willing to dismantle and destroy all of its facilities for plutonium and uranium enrichment at \u201ca complex of sites\u201d extending beyond Yongbyon, its main nuclear complex \u2014 which he put on the table in talks last year with South Korean President Moon Jae-in \u2014 if the United States reciprocates with measures of its own. Kim has not stated that publicly, and the cost of such an offer is likely to be steep. For now, South Korea has urged the Trump administration to take a small step forward on sanctions relief by endorsing modest inter-Korean economic and tourism partnerships that are barred under a web of U.N. sanctions, including the reopening of the Kaesong industrial complex that was shuttered in 2016. Washington and Pyongyang are also reportedly discussing establishing permanent liaison offices to make communication easier. In Singapore, Trump unilaterally agreed to suspend some joint military drills with South Korea, alarming some in the Pentagon. But administration officials said last week there have been no discussions with North Korea about potentially reducing the 30,000 U.S. military troops stationed in South Korea, despite Trump having questioned the costs of that long-standing security arrangement. Harry Kazianis, an analyst at the Center for the National Interest, solicited predictions about the summit from 76 national security and foreign policy experts. More than two-thirds were pessimistic about the Trump administration\u2019s ability to secure significant concessions, he said, while about 20\u00a0percent were hopeful and 10\u00a0percent squarely optimistic. Kazianis, who put himself in the optimist camp, said he supports Trump \u201clighting the traditional playbook on fire\u201d and agreeing to a peace declaration to give Kim more confidence. \u201cThe most important thing we could have is the normalization of dialogue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt happens every time we\u2019re in talks with North Korea \u2014 something breaks up the talks, it takes a year or two to talk again, and North Korea has more weapons that are more advanced and we lose traction.\u201d Others cautioned that agreements outside of nuclear disarmament \u2014 such as a peace declaration or progress on returning the remains of U.S. troops \u2014 will distract from the most pressing goal. \u201cI see a disturbing trend of talking about nonnuclear issues that will feed into the narrative of the summit already being a success,\u201d said Jung Pak, a former U.S. intelligence official now at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThe problem with a peace declaration is that it will divert all the oxygen in the media.\u201d For Trump, that could be good enough. At campaign rallies last fall, Trump heralded North Korea\u2019s suspension of missile tests as a sign of success. Frank Jannuzi, a former Democratic aide on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, acknowledged that Pyongyang\u2019s testing freeze has reduced the sense of crisis in Northeast Asia. Absent a direct provocation from Kim, Jannuzi said: \u201cTrump has signaled an abundance of patience, perhaps a surplus beyond what any of us would counsel him to say publicly. The process is underway and it will not end as long as Trump is president. Eventually, however, there will be a political question: Can Trump credibly claim any real progress if they are still producing fissile material? My answer would be no.\u201d","11":"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) came out against President Trump\u2019s border wall national emergency declaration this weekend, and in doing so he provided what is likely to be the 51st and decisive vote against it. If nothing changes between now and the vote, that means both chambers of Congress will have combined to void the declaration. Practically speaking, this signifies less than it might seem. Trump could, and likely will, simply veto it, at which point both chambers would need to produce two-thirds majorities to override the veto. Neither chamber has those kinds of numbers voting against the declaration \u2014 much less voting for a veto override. The national emergency would then move forward. But it\u2019s worth taking stock of how significant this moment is \u2014 and how it could potentially impact the battle that actually will decide the fate of the national emergency declaration: the legal case. We have seen over and over again how a closely divided GOP-controlled Senate has come close to rebuking the president. Almost always, holdouts like Paul, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and then-Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) were prevailed upon to toe the line in the end. When enough Republicans have crossed over to rebuke Trump, it has almost always been in symbolic ways: Jamal Khashoggi, Trump\u2019s trade wars, the media not being \u201cthe enemy of the people,\u201d and the withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan. This time, there\u2019s meat on the bone. The GOP-controlled Senate would actually be taking concrete action to stop Trump, thereby forcing Trump to veto something. It would be his first veto, in fact. This registers that he is acting in clear opposition to \u2014 and overturning \u2014 the will of Congress. That matters from a PR standpoint. Congress not only declined to give Trump the money for his border wall even when he shut down the government over it, but now it would be explicitly disapproving of his effort to get around its decision not to appropriate the money. That\u2019s two rebukes on the same issue, and Trump would be pushing past both of them. The question from there is whether those twin rebukes might also matter for the legal battle. However people feel about this particular national emergency declaration, Congress did give the presidency rather broad authority to declare such emergencies. When it passed the National Emergencies Act in the 1970s, it handed over some of its constitutional authority over the purse strings of government. That authority has not been tested like it is now, but that does not mean the courts will necessarily say it goes too far. Paul, for one, thinks that it will. He is actually predicting that the Supreme Court will strike down the national emergency declaration if and when it comes to that point, and he says Congress\u2019s votes will matter. \u201cWe spent the last two months debating how much money should be spent on a wall, and Congress came to a clear conclusion: $1.3 billion,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWithout question, the president\u2019s order for more wall money contradicts the will of Congress and will, in all likelihood, be struck down by the Supreme Court.\u201d Ohio State University law professor Peter M. Shane also thinks the votes could matter: The joint resolution underscores the big-picture constitutional dimension of the fight. Congress\u2019 power of the purse is its heavy artillery in the scheme of checks and balances. The Constitution underscores its significance through redundancy. Not only does Article I vest the spending power in the legislative branch, but a separate provision bars the executive branch from spending money unless appropriated. If presidents can find ways to work around Congress\u2019 rejection of their requested spending priorities, Congress\u2019 big gun has been silenced. ... A joint resolution underscoring that Congress has deliberately rejected the inclusion of border wall fencing in response to a presidential request could well move a court to say that this statute will not help finance it. Jessica Levinson of Loyola Law School says this is likely to come down to whether the courts (a) decide to narrowly interpret the statute or (b) focus more on whether there is actually an emergency and whether Trump has this authority. \u201cIt certainly adds weight to the idea that this is executive overreach and a blatant and problematic end-run around Congress,\u201d Levinson said. \u201cThey not only decided not to appropriate the funds, but are saying even more definitively, \u2018Do not do this. Do not go around us.\u2019\u201d Levinson pointed to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold Trump\u2019s travel ban last year, though, as an example of how it might keep its focus on the statute. The court said in its 5-4 decision that determining Trump\u2019s underlying motives \u2014 including about potentially banning Muslim immigration \u2014 from his tweets and public comments was beyond its responsibilities. Since then, Trump has appointed and gotten another justice confirmed, Brett M. Kavanaugh. In this case, though, the court would not have to surmise how Congress feels about its authority being usurped; it would have votes on which to base the idea that Congress clearly did not want Trump to take an action involving a power that it afforded him. The courts could also reason, of course, that if Congress really dislikes what Trump is doing, it could stop him by providing more votes. \u201cIt is also possible that some justices who are more inclined to support the administration would take the view that Congress has it within its power to terminate the national emergency and has failed to do so, and so the court should not step in and do something that Congress wasn\u2019t willing or able to do itself,\u201d said Keith E. Whittington of Princeton University. \u201cBut the fact that Congress would have only failed because of the high bar of a veto override should weaken that latter position somewhat.\u201d In short, we have no idea how compelling the courts will find these votes, but it\u2019s possible Paul\u2019s decision may not just be another toothless symbolic rebuke.","12":"Many elected officials have to reckon with their past. \u201cA Virginia Military Institute yearbook overseen by future state Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment in 1968 features a host of racist photos and slurs, including blackface.\u201d Democrats, at least, seem to understand that the past is not past. \u201cDemocratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro on Thursday said he believes the account of the woman accusing Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault, but Castro stopped short of calling for Fairfax to step down.\u201d Past employment in the field of Russian counterintelligence is helpful. \u201cHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has hired officials with experience at the National Security Council to help with his panel\u2019s oversight of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, according to a committee aide. . . But the move appears to have enraged the President and some members of his senior staff, who view the move as an intrusion.\u201d Too bad. In the past, this was not unusual. Now Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) has a unique profile: \u201cHis manner\u2014open, unpretentious, amused\u2014reflects his political values, which have something to do with individual dignity and human solidarity. . . . Brown\u2019s approach to politics is a kind of throwback: He wants to return to a period when the American middle class was strong and secure, and its champion was the Democratic Party.\u201d Honesty and a heartfelt apology for past conduct helps, certainly. \u201cSenator Tim Kaine, a Democrat and former governor, suggested that [Virginia Attorney General Mark] Herring\u2019s contrition and apology to black legislators on Wednesday may preserve his job. \u2018He reached out to each of us individually, very apologetic, he is in dialogue with the legislative black caucus and African American leadership in the state and they have been impressed with his sincerity while they\u2019ve been very disappointed with what happened,\u2019 said Mr. Kaine.\u201d Not clear whether this is enough. In the not-so-distant past, Trump would find a way to blow this up. \u201cThe top Democrat and Republican working on a border-security deal said they\u2019re nearing an accord but that negotiations may go into the weekend, with a week left to pass a spending bill to avert another government shutdown.\u201d Trump was always worried about investigations of his past finances. He should be. \u201cA judge confirmed in a court filing Thursday that federal prosecutors in New York are still investigating campaign finance crimes committed when President Donald Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid two women to stay silent about alleged affairs with Trump. . . . [The judge] said some documents should stay secret because making them public could jeopardize ongoing investigations, \u2018including those pertaining to or arising from Cohen\u2019s campaign finance crimes.\u2019 \u201d Uh-oh.","13":"Eswar Prasad is a professor at Cornell University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.  On Wednesday, the Trump administration nominated David Malpass, now the undersecretary for international affairs at the Treasury Department, for the position of World Bank president. This follows a long-standing tradition dictating that the United States picks the head of the World Bank. But this nomination is different. As with a number of other Trump administration nominees in various agencies, Malpass is known for his antagonism toward the institution and its core objectives, not to mention his open hostility to multilateralism. Other countries, including U.S. allies, should not stand passively by while President Trump brings his slash-and-burn approach to an important multilateral institution that, for all its warts, can be a powerful force for economic and social development around the world. Malpass is an old hand in the world of finance but hardly an economic sage. In 2007, just before the U.S. housing market started unraveling, he confidently predicted it would do just fine. He was chief economist at Bear Stearns, an investment bank that was one of the earliest casualties of the financial crisis. There are some arguments in favor of his nomination. He appears to have been instrumental in pushing through U.S. funding that helped boost the bank\u2019s capital. Moreover, his critique of the World Bank\u2019s loan portfolio, which is heavily weighted toward middle-income emerging market economies such as China and India, rather than low-income developing countries, is on the mark. China hardly needs low-cost financing, but the World Bank sees its lending as key to a good relationship with the world\u2019s second-largest economic power. Even if they can do without the money, countries such as China and India benefit from the World Bank\u2019s expertise in designing social programs to protect the poor, improving health and sanitation, developing infrastructure and mitigating climate change. De-linking the provision of such technical expertise and guidance from direct financing, and using private capital markets to leverage up seed funding provided by the bank, could make its limited resources go further. The World Bank would benefit from such reforms, but this needs to be undertaken by someone who believes in the institution and its objectives, rather than someone who wants to tear down global institutions unless they directly serve the short-term interests of the Trump administration. As the ax-bearer for the Trump agenda, Malpass could divert the institution from its advocacy of policies aimed at combating climate change, mitigating inequality and promoting women\u2019s rights. His appointment would put at risk the global public goods provided by or at least catalyzed by the World Bank. If Malpass does get the job, and does so mainly on the merits of his loyalty to Trump and their mutual distaste for global institutions, it bodes ill for the legitimacy of the bank. So far, there is limited resistance on the horizon as the Trump administration tries to bulldoze its way to having its nominee accepted as the next World Bank president. Even though Malpass is unlikely to receive resounding endorsements from U.S allies, no country seems eager to take on the Trump administration openly at this stage. Still, as the selection process proceeds, it is likely that other countries will start looking into more palatable candidates. But it will take a concerted and coordinated effort by other countries to resist U.S. efforts to exercise its traditional prerogative of choosing the person to run the World Bank. The most effective implicit threat wielded by the Trump administration, if it does not get its way with choosing the next World Bank president, would be U.S. disengagement from the institution. This would not exactly be a death blow, but it would certainly damage the institution\u2019s effectiveness and long-term viability. In short, the World Bank board, which will ultimately choose the next president, has no good choices. The best realistic course of action would be to allow the United States to choose the next president but insist on a candidate who is more acceptable to a broad swath of the institution\u2019s membership. This could keep the United States engaged but also limit any damage from a Malpass presidency. There is certainly no shortage of qualified candidates. Ngozi Okonjo-Iwaela, a former World Bank senior official and Nigerian finance ninister, is a U.S. citizen who is widely respected by the international development community. There are others, including qualified women such as former PepsiCo chief executive Indra Nooyi, who could fit the bill as well. The World Bank is a cherished multilateral institution that needs to change but still has the potential to do much good for the world. It would stand a better chance with a more qualified leader than David Malpass.

Trump pick for World Bank chief spent years criticizing its mission","14":"Last month, World Bank President Jim Kim suddenly resigned, three years before the end of his contract. In response, President Trump nominated as Kim\u2019s replacement David Malpass, current\u00a0undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs and former chief economist for Bear Stearns in the years running up to the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Malpass, like other key Trump appointees, has expressed a strong desire to dismantle, rather than champion, the institution he has been tapped to lead. President Trump may well achieve his short-term interest in getting one of his loyalists into the World Bank\u2019s top position. But this outcome will likely undermine the longer-term strategic objectives of the United States in sustaining its influence over the World Bank and the institution\u2019s own eminent status. Editorial writers have argued over whether Malpass is the right choice for the World Bank presidency, but nearly everyone agrees that the selection is a foregone conclusion. There is a long-standing norm that dictates that the United States gets its pick for the World Bank presidency in exchange for European counterparts getting their choice for the International Monetary Fund\u2019s managing director. In the nearly 75-year history of the Bretton Woods Institutions, this so-called gentlemen\u2019s agreement has never been violated. This gentlemen\u2019s agreement stands in tension with the bank\u2019s formal rules for selecting its president. According to the World Bank\u2019s charter, the 25 members of the executive board solicit nomination of candidates from all 189 member states. Nominees are fully vetted by the board, which selects the president by a simple majority vote. The United States (which has always held over 15 percent of the board\u2019s voting shares) does not hold any de facto veto power, as it often does over other key decisions which require a supermajority vote of 85 percent. This gentlemen\u2019s agreement has preserved U.S. influence over the World Bank even as the country\u2019s relative voting power, as well as relative economic power, has shrunk dramatically. The U.S. held over 35 percent of the votes during the heyday of its postwar hegemony, but its current voting shares today fall just shy of 16 percent. By many accounts China has exceeded \u2014 or is close to exceeding \u2014 the U.S.\u00a0share of the world economy. This relative decline has yet to upend the gentlemen\u2019s agreement, but there are clear signs the norm is weakening. As others have noted, in exercising its privileges at the World Bank, the United States has in the past been careful to nominate presidential candidates who have been relatively insulated from the criticism that they are unqualified. The last time the World Bank appointed a blatantly partisan U.S. nominee with little to no development experience was in 2005, when President George W. Bush nominated\u00a0Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz.\u00a0Wolfowitz lasted a scant two years in the job before resigning in the wake of a corruption scandal\u00a0and was succeeded by Robert Zoellick. In 2012, when President Barack Obama put forth his own nominee, he was careful to select a candidate who would not push the limits of tolerance undergirding the gentlemen\u2019s agreement. Kim was a candidate who not only had real bona fides in the development world via his prior work with Partners in Health\u00a0but was also a naturalized U.S. citizen whose Korean American heritage accommodated critics\u2019 demand for more diversity. Nonetheless, even with a viable nominee in place, two highly qualified non-U. S. candidates emerged in 2012 for the first time in World Bank history: Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former finance minister of Nigeria and former managing director of the World Bank, and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo, former minister of finance from Colombia. Okonjo-Iweala has already publicly stated she would run again in 2019, if nominated. The Malpass nomination not only violates the norms surrounding the gentlemen\u2019s agreement. It fails to uphold the basic eligibility criteria the bank itself has set out for the presidency in 2011. These criteria include a \u201cfirm commitment to and appreciation for multilateral cooperation\u201d and \u201ceffective and diplomatic communication skills, impartiality and objectivity.\u201d While Malpass himself recently depicted himself in this light, he has a prior public record that suggests he is hostile to multilateralism. Malpass\u2019 connections to Trump will not win him many friends among the European members of the Executive Board, whose implicit cooperation is critical to the U.S. leveraging the World Bank to its own ends. Similarly, Malpass\u2019s goal of eliminating World Bank development lending to China makes some economic sense in light of Chinese growth and vast foreign reserves, but will not make an ally of China. Indeed, reforms that threaten to ostracize China (now the bank\u2019s third largest shareholder) may very well incentivize China and other rising powers to engage in what international relations scholars call \u201cforum shopping\u201d or \u201ccontested multilateralism\u201d\u00a0\u2014 exercising their ability to exit the bank and put their increasing political and economic power (and even their own borrowing) behind alternative institutions, such as the New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Malpass may well be the World Bank president that the current U.S. administration wants.

The White House Counsel\u2019s Office explained that disregarding the legislative branch\u2019s power of the purse creates \u201chigh litigation risk.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) privately advised him two weeks ago that doing so would divide the GOP and could lead to a formal resolution of disapproval. Nevertheless, Trump persisted. \u201cWhite House lawyers have told Trump he could reprogram money without calling an emergency,\u201d Fred Barbash, Ellen Nakashima and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cBut Trump \u2026 has been determined to declare an emergency, partially for fear of looking weak.\u201d This is just the latest, and possibly starkest, illustration of Trump\u2019s disdain for the rule of law, as well as the premium he places on political expediency over constitutional norms and legal guardrails. That\u2019s why the president\u2019s looming announcement of an \u201cemergency\u201d in the Rose Garden this morning should be viewed in conjunction with Andy McCabe\u2019s new book about the events that transpired when Trump fired McCabe\u2019s boss, Jim Comey, as FBI director in 2017. McCabe says he opened a formal investigation into the president\u2019s ties to Russia because he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d that the probe would be shut down if he was quickly removed as acting director. Jeff Sessions later fired McCabe the day before he would have qualified for a full pension after Trump pilloried him on Twitter and attacked his wife over her unsuccessful Virginia state Senate campaign. \u201cBetween the world of chaos and the world of order stands the rule of law. Yet now the rule of law is under attack, including from the president himself,\u201d McCabe writes in \u201cThe Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump,\u201d which comes out Tuesday. \u201cPeople do not appreciate how far we have fallen from normal standards of presidential accountability. Today we have a president who is willing not only to comment prejudicially on criminal prosecutions but to comment on ones that potentially affect him. He does both of these things almost daily. He is not just sounding a dog whistle. He is lobbying for a result. The president has stepped over bright ethical and moral lines wherever he has encountered them.\u201d -- It was overshadowed yesterday because Washington was so consumed with whether Trump would sign the bipartisan spending bill to avert another shutdown, but there was another story that also highlighted the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to flout the rules: A Trump appointee in the Department of Homeland Security has declined to cooperate with an inspector general's investigation into allegations that career government staffers faced political retaliation, yet she\u2019s faced no discipline for stonewalling. \u201cChristine Ciccone, a former senior official at the State Department and now an assistant secretary of legislative affairs at DHS, has failed to agree to an interview with investigators \u2018despite repeated requests made to both her and her attorney over many months,\u2019 DHS Acting Inspector General John Kelly wrote to Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen,\u201d per NBC\u2019s Dan de Luce. \u201cThat office is looking into allegations of retribution against career State Department employees, and has tried to speak with Ciccone as a \u2018key witness\u2019 in that inquiry since September, Kelly wrote in a memo released by three Democratic lawmakers. \u2026 The appointee\u2019s response \u2018sets a dangerous precedent contrary to the fundamental tenants\u2019 of the law establishing government inspector generals, and carries \u2018the potential to undermine our critical oversight function,\u2019 he wrote. -- The biggest story of the day by far, however, is Trump\u2019s planned emergency declaration. House Democrats say they plan to move in the coming days or possibly weeks to pass a resolution formally disapproving of the president\u2019s gambit. They will do it in a way that forces McConnell to take up the measure, despite his resistance to doing so, within 18 days. Republicans have a 53-to-47 majority in the Senate, but all the resolution needs to pass is a simple majority, and several GOP lawmakers have suggested that they\u2019d be amenable to voting for it. If that happened, Trump would then be forced to veto the resolution. It would be the first veto of his presidency. An override would be unlikely; it\u2019s hard to imagine 20 GOP senators crossing over to break with the president. But the debate over the resolution ensures several news cycles of high political drama. \u201cIf their resolution fails to pass the Senate or is vetoed by Trump, the House would probably sue,\u201d per Rachael Bade, Seung Min Kim, Mike DeBonis and Paul Kane. \u201cRep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), a House Judiciary Committee member, said his discussions with House lawyers had centered around a 1952 Supreme Court ruling, Youngstown Sheet and Tube v. Sawyer, in which the court rejected President Harry Truman\u2019s attempt to seize and operate the nation\u2019s steel mills to avert a strike. \u2018They\u2019re about to make the steel seizure decision the most famous Supreme Court case in Washington for the next couple months,\u2019 Raskin said about House lawyers. \u2018The Supreme Court said a red light from Congress is a red light from Congress, and you can\u2019t run a red.\u2019\u201d -- The spending deal almost fell apart, and McConnell had to talk with Trump by phone at least three times yesterday. To get his sign-off, the majority leader agreed to offer public support for the emergency declaration, despite his misgivings. \u201cWe thought he was good to go all morning, and then suddenly it\u2019s like everything is off the rails,\u201d said one senior Republican aide. That staffer was one of more than two dozen key players who were interviewed for a ticktock by Robert Costa, Bade, Dawsey and Kim on how the last few weeks went down: \u201cPrivately, Trump complained vociferously about the final deal and said he felt Republican negotiators had failed him \u2026 But Trump did not have the stomach for another shutdown and told aides it had generated nonstop negative coverage. \u2026 Still, Trump can be combustible and sometimes acts rashly when he feels cornered, so some Republican senators spent recent days on the phone, soothing him and trying to persuade him to hold his fire. \u2026 Democrats decided in the final days they needed to be careful with their language, worried they could provoke Trump into another shutdown. \u2026 One conferee summarized the instructions from Democratic leaders: \u2018Don\u2019t poke the bear.\u2019\u201d -- \u201cWhile the move means the country will avoid another protracted shutdown, legal specialists warned that the long-term costs to American democracy could be steep,\u201d Charlie Savage reports in the New York Times: \u201cIt sets a precedent that a president can, without regard to an actual existence of an emergency, use this tool to evade the normal democratic process and fund projects on his own,\u201d said Syracuse University law professor William Banks, who co-authored the book \u201cNational Security Law and the Power of the Purse.\u201d \u201cThis is a real institutional threat to the separation of powers to use emergency powers to enable the president to bypass Congress to build a wall on his own initiative that our elected representatives have chosen not to fund.\u201d \u201cEvery time this president does something that would have been unthinkable under a previous administration, and every time he acts in a way we\u2019re used to seeing in an authoritarian regime, a little piece of our democracy dies, and this is a pretty big piece,\u201d said Elizabeth Goitein, who oversaw a study of presidential emergency powers for the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. \u201cI know what the potential is for these laws to be abused once that seal is broken.\u201d -- \u201cThere will be lawsuits. Lots of them,\u201d Fred, Ellen and Josh report. \u201cFrom California to Congress, the litigants will multiply. They will file suit in numerous jurisdictions \u2014 certainly within the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit on the West Coast, in U.S. District Court in Washington and maybe even in New York. That\u2019s been the pattern in the hundreds of lawsuits, many of them successful, brought against the Trump administration, the idea being that some judge somewhere will block the wall. \u2026 \u201cAnyone who claims certainty about the ultimate legal outcome, which will most likely come from the Supreme Court, is playing in their own field of dreams. \u2026 In 1976, thinking it was cracking down on presidentially declared states of emergency, Congress passed a law, the National Emergencies Act, that actually enabled them. \u2018When you and I think of an emergency, we think of the U.S. under attack.\u2019 said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston. \u2018But the statute doesn\u2019t have that sort of definition.\u2019 Indeed, it has no definition.\u201d -- The Post\u2019s Editorial Board explains that the president\u2019s decision treats \u201cthe will of Congress, and the Constitution, with cavalier contempt\u201d: \u201cHis fulminations about a border wall having failed to convince the legislative branch, which forged a deal that yielded less than a quarter of the funds the president demanded, he has decided by his planned emergency declaration simply to render the legislative branch irrelevant. That\u2019s a tried-and-true technique for autocrats the world over; it\u2019s not what the framers had in mind when they granted Congress the power of the purse. By his declaration, Mr. Trump will inaugurate a new, imperial phase of his presidency.\u201d -- Hypocrisy watch: Trump said on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d in 2014 that Barack Obama could be impeached for taking executive action on immigration. Obama turned to what he liked to call his pen and his phone after House Republicans blocked an overhaul of the immigration system that had passed the Senate with bipartisan support. Months after expressing doubt about his legal authority to do so, Obama signed an executive order to protect the undocumented parents of children who were born in the United States, and thus American citizens, from being deported. \u201cThis is a very, very dangerous thing that should be overwritten easily by the Supreme Court,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cI think certainly he could be impeached ...\u201d Around that time, Trump also ripped Obama for using an executive order to shield \u201cdreamers\u201d from deportation. It\u2019s become a cliche, but there really is a tweet for everything: Ted Cruz watches President Trump speak last month near the Rio Grande in McAllen, Tex. (Jim Watson\/AFP\/Getty Images) -- The last two years have offered a series of tests to reveal which Republican lawmakers were genuine when they criticized Obama for executive overreach. It has been especially fascinating to watch the divergent paths that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, two of Trump\u2019s main rivals for the GOP nomination, have taken since 2016. Both are Cuban Americans whose world views were deeply shaped by their fathers\u2019 anti-communist opposition to Fidel Castro. Both are young and clearly hope to run for president again in 2024 or down the road. Cruz was maybe the most outspoken Republican in the Senate when it came to attacking Obama for using executive power during the second term. He routinely threw around words like \u201cking\u201d and \u201cemperor\u201d to describe Obama. Before Obama issued that order to protect the dreamers, Cruz took to the floor of the U.S. Senate to read from the speech that Cicero delivered on the floor of the Roman Senate in 63 B.C. warning that Catiline was out to violently destroy their republic. Cruz replaced all the references to \u201cCatiline\u201d with \u201cObama\u201d as he quoted Cicero: \u201cWhen, President Obama, do you mean to cease abusing our patience? How long is that madness of yours still to mock us? When is there to be an end to that unbridled audacity of yours, swaggering about as it does now?\u201d That year, Cruz said at the Conservative Political Action Conference: \u201cThis president of the United States is the first president we've ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore.\u201d (PolitiFact rated this claim as false.) In 2015, when Obama moved to rename Mount McKinley, Cruz called it \u201cthe latest manifestation of the megalomaniacal, imperial presidency that we have seen for six and a half years. This administration has been the most lawless administration we have ever seen. And this president routinely disregards the law, disregards the Constitution [and] disregards the Congress.\u201d Last night, though, Cruz defended Trump\u2019s move: \u201cDemocrats\u2019 intransigence has left the president with no other choice but to take executive action.\u201d He added that he\u2019ll wait to see where Trump takes the money from, giving him an opening to oppose the move if funds for Texas disaster relief are cannibalized. On the other side, Rubio decried Trump\u2019s decision to go the emergency route. \u201cWe have a crisis at our southern border, but no crisis justifies violating the Constitution,\u201d the Florida Republican said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s national emergency is border security. But a future president may use this exact same tactic to impose the Green New Deal.\u201d -- A parade of conservative intellectuals also lamented Trump\u2019s move and warned the president\u2019s supporters on the right that Republicans will come to rue this day. Here are six takes in that vein: MORE ON THE SPENDING DEAL: -- The $333 billion package, which keeps the government open through the end of September, passed 83 to 16 in the Senate and 300 to 128 in the House.\u00a0Mike DeBonis breaks down key items in the 1,169-page legislation: The administration will be able to hire as many as 1,200 new Border Patrol officers. The bill provides $100 million in technology funds for ports of entry and $112 million for aircraft and sensor systems. The administration secured $564 million to beef up scanning capability at these ports, where most drug smuggling and human trafficking happens. Democrats got a \u201csoft cap\u201d on the number of immigrants detained at Immigrations and Customs Enforcement facilities. The bill lowers the detainee cap from 49,000 to 40,000. But Republicans believe ICE will have the flexibility it needs to do its job. The Census Bureau will receive a $1 billion increase in funding, which was a Democratic demand. -- The legislation does not\u00a0offer back pay to low-wage federal contractors who lost a month\u2019s worth of wages because of the last shutdown,\u00a0but it does provide\u00a0a 1.9 percent pay raise for federal employees,\u00a0applying retroactively to Jan. 6. Eric Yoder reports: \u201cUnder the bill, senior political appointees would see their first raise since 2010, although not the large jump they otherwise would have received under the complex federal pay law. \u2026 The raise is further to be divided: 1.4 percent across the board and the remainder paid in amounts varying by city area, based on pay comparisons reported last fall by an advisory council. The Washington-Baltimore metro zone is among the areas where federal pay is deemed to be the furthest behind, meaning it would receive one of the larger raises.\u201d MORE ON MCCABE\u2019S BOOK:\u00a0 -- Andy McCabe portrays Jeff Sessions in an especially negative light in his memoir. Greg Miller reports: \u201cThe attorney general\u2019s views on race and religion are described as reprehensible. \u2026 The FBI was better off when \u2018you all only hired Irishmen,\u2019 Sessions said in one diatribe about the bureau\u2019s workforce. \u2018They were drunks but they could be trusted. Not like all those new people with nose rings and tattoos \u2014 who knows what they\u2019re doing?\u2019 \u2026 Sessions \u2018believed that Islam \u2014 inherently \u2014 advocated extremism\u2019 and ceaselessly sought to draw connections between crime and immigration. \u2018Where\u2019s he from?\u2019 was his first question about a suspect. The next: \u2018Where are his parents from?\u2019 \u2026 \u201cInevitably, the book includes disturbing new detail about Trump\u2019s subservience to Russian President Vladimir Putin. During an Oval Office briefing in July 2017, Trump refused to believe U.S. intelligence reports that North Korea had test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile \u2014 a test that Kim Jong Un had called a Fourth of July \u2018gift\u2019 to \u2018the arrogant Americans.\u2019 Trump dismissed the missile launch as a \u2018hoax,\u2019 McCabe writes. \u2018He thought that North Korea did not have the capability to launch such missiles. He said he knew this because Vladimir Putin had told him so.\u2019\u201d -- CBS's Scott\u00a0Pelley, who interviewed McCabe for a \"60 Minutes\u201d segment to air Sunday, says he described conversations that officials had about using the 25th Amendment to oust the president. Matt Zapotosky and John Wagner report: Pelley \u201cdescribed the discussions of the 25th Amendment as \u2018counting noses\u2019 \u2014 or speculating on where various Cabinet members might stand on the question. Pelley said McCabe disputes the assertion, advanced by defenders of [Rod] Rosenstein, that the deputy attorney general was not serious about wearing a wire. Pelley said McCabe took the idea to FBI lawyers for a discussion afterward. ... About two hours after the clip aired, Trump blasted McCabe on Twitter, calling him \u2018a disgrace to the FBI and a disgrace to our Country.\u2019 The Justice Department also disputed some of what McCabe contended.\u201d William Weld speaks this morning during a breakfast in Bedford, N.H. Charles Krupa\/AP) WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld told an audience in New Hampshire this morning that he will try to take on Trump in the 2020 Republican presidential primary. Annie Linskey and Dave Weigel report: \u201cWeld, 73, said he would seek to determine over the coming months if he can raise enough money to continue his challenge of the president. He said he would run on a traditional Republican agenda of fiscal responsibility and provide a stylistic contrast to Trump. \u2018It is time for all people of good will \u2014 and our country is filled with people of good will \u2014 to take a stand and plant a flag,\u2019 Weld said during a speech Friday at a Politics & Eggs breakfast in Bedford, N.H. \u2026 Weld opened his remarks in the first primary state with an unflinching denunciation of the president \u2014 \u2018he acts like a schoolyard bully\u2019 \u2014 and Republicans in Washington who \u2018exhibit all the symptoms of Stockholm syndrome.\u2019\u201d GET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b William Barr, now the\u00a0attorney general, testifies during his confirmation hearing last month. (Andrew Harnik\/AP) ALL THE PRESIDENT\u2019S MEN: -- Bill Barr was confirmed by the Senate and quickly sworn in as the next attorney general. Matt Zapotosky and Karoun Demirjian report: \u201cSenators voted 54 to 45, mostly along party lines, to confirm Barr, who will now supervise [Mueller\u2019s probe]. Among Barr\u2019s first major decisions will be what to tell the public about the results of that investigation. ...\u00a0People familiar with the matter said Barr has all but settled on a new second-in-command, with Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who appointed Mueller, expected to leave soon. Barr has not disclosed any names publicly.\u201d -- What does he know?\u00a0Matt Schlapp, chairman of the organization that hosts\u00a0the Conservative Political Action Conference, and whose wife, Mercedes, works in the White House as a strategic communications adviser, tweeted after Barr was confirmed that Mueller will be gone soon. \u201cTomorrow will be the first day that President Trump will have a fully operational confirmed Attorney General,\u201d Schlapp wrote. \u201cLet that sink in. Mueller will be gone soon.\u201d Politico reports that the White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. (Politico) -- Trump is using a charm offensive to coax Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to retire.\u00a0The New Yorker\u2019s Jeffrey Toobin reports: \u201cTrump has shown unusual solicitude for Justice Thomas and his wife, Ginni, a hard-right political activist. The President and the First Lady had the Thomases to dinner, and then Trump welcomed Ginni and some of her movement colleagues to the White House for an hour-long discussion. \u2026 Trump rarely engages in this kind of cultivation, and it\u2019s reasonable to speculate that he\u2019s trying to persuade the Justice that his seat would be in good hands if he decided to leave. \u2026 There seems little doubt, however, about what would happen if either [Thomas or Ruth Bader Ginsburg] leaves in the next year or two. The President would likely nominate as a replacement Amy Coney Barrett, a forty-seven-year-old judge on the Seventh Circuit. A former professor at Notre Dame Law School, Barrett was nominated to the appeals court by Trump, in 2017, and she has already been considered for a Supreme Court seat\u2014the one that went to [Brett] Kavanaugh.\u201d -- The\u00a0Trump Organization gave up on its plan to roll out two new hotel lines in dozens of cities across the country. Jonathan O'Connell and David A. Fahrenthold report: \u201cThe president\u2019s eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who took over the company when Trump entered the White House, cited political attacks and negative media coverage in announcing the decision. The brothers announced plans for the two lower-cost chains in a reception at Trump Tower shortly after Trump took office. Since then, the company has come under near-constant scrutiny from ethics officials and congressional Democrats over its business practices. After initially saying the company had dozens of deals in the works, no hotels, under the chain names of Scion and American Idea, have opened.\u201d -- \u201cAfter gaining four pounds over the past year, Trump is officially considered obese,\u201d Toluse Olorunnipa and Carolyn Y. Johnson report. He\u00a0\u201cremains in \u2018good health\u2019 ... according to a memorandum signed by his doctor and released Thursday by the White House. Sean P. Conley, the physician to the president, said in the memorandum that 'there were no findings of significance or changes to report'\u00a0after Trump underwent a four-hour physical exam that included 11 specialists last week. The White House released the memorandum, which included basic details about Trump\u2019s health, including his heart rate (70 beats per minute) and his blood pressure (118\/80 mmHg). ... Trump, 72, stands 6-foot-3 and weighs 243 pounds, according to the memorandum.\u201d -- Fishing expedition: A U.S. attorney appointed by Trump demanded millions of North Carolina voter records from the state for an investigation into noncitizen voting. But state\u00a0elections officials refused to comply with his subpoenas and will provide fewer than 800 voter files. Amy Gardner reports: \u201cThe board filed motions in federal court last month seeking to block the subpoenas. \u2026 The subpoenas issued last summer sought all North Carolina voter registration records for eight years and actual ballots cast for five years in counties in the eastern half of the state. A separate subpoena to the state\u2019s Division of Motor Vehicles demanded voter registration applications submitted by those born outside the United States. \u2026 State officials objected strenuously \u2026 [calling] the subpoenas a fishing expedition primarily targeting those born in other countries and accused Higdon of wasting resources in search of a type of election fraud that is exceedingly rare.\u201d  -- Putting a bull in a china shop: Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the World Bank once said that it should be \u201cthrown away and started over,\u201d along with similar institutions. CNN\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski reports: \u201cDavid Malpass made the comments while speaking to a local Republican gathering in Albertson, New York, in May 2011. \u2026 Although Malpass has been an outspoken critic of the World Bank, his 2011 comments feature his sharpest attacks on the organization and its mission. \u2018For 25 years, literally, I've been an opponent of the IMF and the World Bank and of the global \u2014 the system of trying to globalize US foreign policy and defer to foreign authorities in setting our policy,\u2019 Malpass said in his 2011 remarks.\u201d -- At least 33 former Trump administration officials have found ways around an ethics pledge requiring them to avoid \u201clobbying activities\u201d for five years after leaving their government jobs. ProPublica\u2019s Derek Kravitz reports: \u201cAmong the 33 former officials, at least 18 have recently registered as lobbyists. The rest work at firms in jobs that closely resemble federal lobbying. Almost all work on issues they oversaw or helped shape when they were in government. \u2026 Some former officials are tiptoeing around the rules by engaging in \u2018shadow lobbying,\u2019 which typically entails functions such as \u2018strategic consulting\u2019 that don\u2019t require registering as a lobbyist. Others obtained special waivers allowing them to go back to lobbying. In a few cases, they avoided signing the pledge altogether.\u201d -- Defying the president\u2019s request, the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority voted to close down two aging coal plants, one of which buys most of its coal from a major Trump donor. Steven Mufson reports: \u201cThe TVA directors voted overwhelmingly to close the Paradise 3 plant in Kentucky and the Bull Run plant in Tennessee. Three of the four people appointed by Trump to the TVA board joined the 6-1 majority voting to close down the Paradise coal unit and all four joined the unanimous vote to retire Bull Run. ...\u00a0Trump, who vowed during his campaign to help the coal industry, set up a clash with the TVA with his call to keep open the Paradise 3 unit, which buys much of its coal from a mining company chaired by Robert E. Murray, one of the president\u2019s major donors and supporters. ...\u00a0The board decided that it would be too costly to sustain the 49-year-old plant.\u201d -- White House communications director Bill Shine's wife continues to peddle false anti-vaccination conspiracy theories, saying diseases such as measles \"keep you healthy & fight cancer.\u201d In\u00a0tweets, Darla Shine said she was sorry her children were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella, adding that baby boomers are \u201calive today\u201d because they suffered through measles in their childhoods. (CNN) Presidential hopeful Howard Schultz said he'll drop out of the race if Democrats nominate a centrist. (Joshua Lott\/Getty Images) 2020 WATCH: -- The DNC announced qualification requirements for the presidential debates that include metrics related to grass-roots support. Michael Scherer reports: \u201cThe expansive new qualification requirements are designed to allow a\u00a0historically large group of candidates to make the stage at events that are likely to be split over two consecutive nights to accommodate the crowded field. Candidates can qualify either by attracting campaign donations from at least 65,000 people, including at least 200 people from at least 20 states, or by registering at least 1 percent in three state or national polls from a list of surveys approved by the party. The only way to qualify for early Democratic debates in 2015 was to register at least 1 percent in three national polls. \u2026 The first set of debates will be broadcast in June by NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo, followed by CNN-sponsored debates in July.\u201d --\u00a0Howard Schultz said he will drop his independent campaign if Democrats nominate a centrist. Michael Scherer and Tracy Jan report: The former Starbucks chief executive \u201chas premised his exploration of a presidential campaign on the assumption that Democrats are likely to nominate a candidate that embraces what he calls \u2018far-left\u2019 ideas that will turn off enough moderate voters to open space for an independent candidate \u2026 A more moderate Democratic nominee, such as former vice president Joe Biden or former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, could complicate Schultz\u2019s perceived path to victory.\u201d-- Schultz's presidential bid is already angering some Democrats, brewing some trouble for Starbucks.\u00a0From Bloomberg News's John McCormick and Leslie Patton: \u201cAlmost 7 of 10 Starbucks stores are in the roughly 500 counties Democrat Hillary Clinton won in the 2016 presidential election, a Bloomberg analysis of data from location intelligence firm Esri shows. The potential for Starbucks to get hit by protests or an organized boycott has triggered some investors to boost bets against the company in recent weeks.\u201d -- A\u00a0unanimously passed Senate\u00a0bill to make lynching a federal hate crime was co-sponsored by two 2020 rivals, Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Cory Booker (N.J.). Elise Viebeck and Donna Cassata report: \u201cThe legislation, approved on a voice vote, would ensure that lynching triggers an enhanced sentence under federal law, like other hate crimes. The measure was sponsored by the Senate\u2019s three African American members: [Harris], [Booker] and Tim Scott (R-S.C.). [Harris and Booker] spoke graciously about their joint effort Thursday morning on the Senate floor. Booker had introduced the bill with Harris and Scott after what Harris described as 200 previous attempts by Congress to pass similar legislation. Proponents of the measure expect the Democratic-led House to pass the legislation and send it to [Trump] for his signature.\u201d -- In a snub of Elizabeth Warren, former Massachusetts attorney general Martha Coakley is hosting a fundraiser for Harris\u00a0in Boston. The Boston Globe\u2019s Matt Stout and Victoria McGrane\u00a0say it's \u201ca sign that Warren cannot count on home state loyalty to bring prominent Massachusetts players to her side.\u201d Warren, though, is holding a fundraiser Monday night in Los Angeles, in Harris's state. In case you forgot, Coakley is the Democrat who blew what should have been an easily winnable 2011 special election to Scott Brown for Ted Kennedy's seat. Warren won the seat back for Democrats the next year.\u00a0 -- Trump\u2019s reelection campaign\u00a0has started compiling opposition research on Harris, Booker and Warren. Politico\u2019s Alex Isenstadt reports: \u201cTrump has told allies he sees [Joe] Biden, who remains undecided on a 2020 bid, as the most formidable potential general election rival. The president has said privately that Biden would appeal to a wider swath of voters than other Democratic hopefuls. Yet among the president\u2019s inner circle, there\u2019s widespread doubt that Biden could survive a primary, after a three-decade political career and positions on issues such as the Iraq war and crime that are anathema to liberals. Many are convinced that whoever emerges from the Democratic primary will be an out-of-the-mainstream liberal \u2014 someone who either hails from that wing of the party or has taken pains to align themselves with it.\u201d -- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) offered his support to Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) amid accusations of anti-Semitism. Omar\u2019s office confirmed that Sanders, who is Jewish, made an off-the-record call to the congresswoman. The senator later said he stands by \u201cour Muslim brothers and sisters.\u201d (Daily Beast) -- Texas Republicans are requesting more assistance from the national party for 2020 after several House incumbents lost or had closer-than-expected reelection races. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram\u2019s Andrea Drusch reports: \u201cThe 2018 cycle scared many Republicans, who lost two congressional seats, and offered the first real evidence that the state might move from red to purple. \u2026 So acute is that concern, that members of the Texas delegation sat down last week with leaders from the House GOP campaign arm \u2014 which typically assists with polling, opposition research and negative advertising \u2014 to request more help with their races. \u2026 This cycle, Democrats are targeting six more seats representing Texas suburbs \u2014 the districts held by Reps. McCaul, Chip Roy, Pete Olson, Will Hurd, Kenny Marchant and John Carter.\u201d -- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Democratic primary victory over former congressman Joe Crowley appears to be inspiring other primary challenges in New York. The New York Times\u2019s Shane Goldmacher reports: \u201cParty insurgents are plotting and preparing to battle with the entrenched establishment \u2014 targeting as many as a half-dozen Congress members in and around New York City \u2014 over what it means to be a Democrat and a progressive in the age of [Trump]. \u2026 In Manhattan, Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, could be challenged \u2026 And in the Bronx and Westchester, some progressives are pushing to unseat Eliot L. Engel, a white congressman who represents a diversifying district where white residents are now in the minority \u2014 just like where Ms. Ocasio-Cortez won.\u201d (Jeff Stein profiles\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez's staffers on Capitol Hill.) -- Beto O\u2019Rourke is visiting Wisconsin and Illinois with his 2020 decision pending.

(CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talks today with Chinese President Xi Jinping, as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He look on, before a meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. (Andy Wong\/AFP\/Getty Images) THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- Trump might be asking Chinese President\u00a0Xi Jinping to do the unthinkable by making\u00a0a sweeping overhaul of China\u2019s economy a key condition to\u00a0ending trade hostilities. Anna Fifield and David J. Lynch report: \u201cSecuring Xi\u2019s assent to abandon the economic model that lifted China from Maoist impoverishment to become the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy would crown Trump\u2019s confrontational diplomacy with success. \u2026 But few analysts anticipate such an outcome. \u2026 Policies of the kind that Xi envisaged in 2013 \u2014 and that Trump wants now \u2014 are hard for the party to push through as the economy slows. Growth decelerated to 6.4 percent last year, and a state-run paper this week warned it could sink to 6 percent in 2019.\u201d -- Meanwhile, two competing proposals from Congress would curb the president\u2019s authority over trade policy, and Senate Finance Chairman Charles E.

Wall Street Journal\u2019s Joshua Jamerson reports: The proposals \u201cwould increase congressional oversight on executive-branch actions under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act. \u2026 Grassley told reporters he had instructed his staff to seek measures that could gain broad bipartisan support rather than pursue any one proposal. \u2026 Free-trade proponents in Congress have long felt uneasy about President Trump\u2019s steel tariffs \u2026 But a House of Representatives under Democratic control\u2014and Mr. Grassley\u2019s ascent on the Finance Committee\u2014is breathing new life into GOP-led efforts to check Mr. Trump and future presidents.\u201d -- The U.S. commander\u00a0leading the war against the Islamic State\u00a0warned that the terrorist group is far from being defeated and said he disagrees with Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops out of Syria.

'If he wants to meet, just tell me when, where and how and I\u2019ll be there,'\u00a0Maduro said without providing more details. He said both New York meetings lasted several hours. A senior administration official in Washington who was not authorized to speak publicly said U.S. officials were willing to meet with 'former Venezuela officials, including Maduro himself, to discuss their exit plans.'\u201d -- Acting defense secretary Pat Shanahan pledged that any U.S. troop reductions in Afghanistan would occur in coordination with regional allies. The AP\u2019s Lorne Cook and Robert Burns report: \u201cShanahan made clear that if U.S. troop cuts are made, either in connection with peace negotiations with the Taliban or in other circumstances, Washington will consult with NATO to ensure coordination.\u201d -- British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan suffered another parliamentary defeat.

Many of the hard-line Brexiteers in May\u2019s own Conservative Party didn\u2019t back the government. \u2026 The hard-line Brexiteers [were] concerned that the motion, in effect, would mean endorsing the view that Parliament was against leaving without a deal, which they think should be an option. The defeat is symbolic, but it raises the question about what kind of deal \u2014 if any \u2014 could command the support of the House of Commons as Britain hurtles toward its departure from the E.U.\u201d -- Cardinal\u00a0Se\u00e1n O\u2019Malley of Boston, a chief adviser to Pope Francis, warned him that reducing the punishments of clergy members found guilty of abusing minors would cause a scandal.

The funding gap is largely the result of the reliance on property taxes as a primary source of funding for schools. Communities in overwhelmingly white areas tend to be wealthier, and school districts\u2019 ability to raise money depends on the value of local property and the ability of residents to pay higher taxes. And while state budgets gave heavily nonwhite districts slightly more money per student than they gave overwhelmingly white districts, in many states it was not enough to erase the local gaps. \u201cStates have largely failed to keep up with the growing wealth disparities across their communities,\u201d concludes the report released Tuesday by EdBuild, a New Jersey-based research and advocacy group that focuses on school funding. The gap reflects a long-standing view that local schools should be both controlled and funded locally. The funding disparities that result have been challenged in many states, frequently in court. Many states have worked to make formulas more equitable, with varying success. \u201cWhile we have made some progress on the issue of economic inequality in our schools, we still have a terribly inequitable system,\u201d the report said. EdBuild examined the nation\u2019s 13,000 traditional public school districts and found about 7,600 where more than 75 percent of students were white, and about 1,200 where more than 75 percent of students were not white. The nonwhite districts, which included many large cities, were much larger than the white districts, which included many small rural areas. But the two groups each had about the same number of students \u2014 12.8 million children in nonwhite districts and 12.5 million in white districts. Nonwhite districts took in about $54 billion in 2016 in local tax dollars \u2014 or about $4,500 per student. White districts, home to higher incomes and less poverty, collected more than $77 billion, or just over $7,000 per student. On average, states added another $6,900 per student to white districts and almost $7,200 per student in nonwhite districts. But the overall gap in state and local funding was $23 billion. White districts, on average, had more than $2,000 more in funding per student than nonwhite districts. The analysis does not include federal dollars, much of which is targeted to the poorest communities. The problem is worse in states where districts are small, cordoning off wealthy communities and limiting the likelihood that wealthier taxpayers will subsidize poorer students, said Rebecca Sibilia, EdBuild\u2019s chief executive. In states such as Maryland and Virginia, she said, many school districts are comprised of entire counties, making funding more equitable. In Maryland, 880,000 students are served by just 24 districts, vs. New Jersey, where 1.3 million students are divided between 540 districts. Nonwhite districts in Maryland received $501 more per student than white districts, and in Virginia, they got $255 more per student. Overall, the report found 21 states where white districts got more funding and 14 states where nonwhite districts got more. The other states did not have enough racial diversity to meaningfully analyze, the report said. The gap was most dramatic in Arizona, where white districts were given $7,613 more per student than nonwhite districts. A dozen other states had gaps between $2,000 and $4,000 per student, with 10 of the states providing more funding to students in majority-white districts. A spokesperson for the Arizona education department had no immediate comment. Michael Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank, says states should do more to equalize funding. But he added that there is some benefit to local control. \u201cWhen districts have to go to the community to get a bond passed, they have to make the case they are spending their money well and it\u2019s worth investing in,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has been an important form of accountability.\u201d But overall, he said, the system needs to become more equitable. \u201cAll of this is tough sledding in terms of the politics of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an area where the courts have played an important role.\u201d Aaron Smith, an expert on school finance at the libertarian Reason Foundation, also supports more equity. He said conservatives should realize that if school funding were more even, it would bolster school choice programs, which many conservatives back. More equitable funding would make it clear how much money a school should get to educate each student, Smith said. \u201cEvery state has some sort of mechanism in place to try and equalize and neutralize the effects that local property wealth has,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is that these equalization mechanisms vary substantially in terms of how effective they are.\u201d","17":"THE PROGNOSIS House Democratic leaders.\u00a0(J. Scott Applewhite\/AP) Democrats and Obamacare advocates have been pounding a relentless drum over the Trump administration\u2019s moves to undermine the 2010 health-care law. But it\u2019s the health coverage people secure\u00a0through their workplaces that is looking less generous\u00a0by the year, a new survey finds. A study released today\u00a0by the nonpartisan\u00a0research foundation Commonwealth Fund\u00a0finds the number of Americans lacking coverage didn\u2019t worsen during the first two years of President Trump\u2019s term, despite a series of efforts by Republicans in the administration and Congress to ease the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage requirements and remove its penalty for being uninsured. What\u2019s more, a growing pool of Americans with skimpy health insurance plans is fed by those with employer-sponsored coverage \u2014 not people buying plans on their own via the ACA\u2019s individual marketplaces, Commonwealth found. That underscores a long-standing trend wherein employers have grappled with rising health-care costs by requiring workers to pay a larger share of their premiums or offering plans with higher deductibles. \u201cI think our employer-based insurance system is facing a crisis that is related to escalating health care costs and the limited systems available to them to manage those costs,\u201d Commonwealth President David Blumenthal told reporters. Citing a goal of making health insurance less expensive, the administration has expanded access to potentially leaner health plans via association plans and short-term coverage --\u00a0 and has invited states to request changes to their insurance marketplaces that would allow insurers to duck some coverage requirements. Democrats, deeply frustrated by the efforts, routinely accuse the administration of severely undermining the ACA and its consumer protections. \u201cIn all these ways, the administration has tried to undermine the ACA,\u201d Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), chairwoman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that deals with health-care services, said at a hearing yesterday. \u201cI would ask to what end? Due to the administration\u2019s actions, costs for families and working people are skyrocketing.\u201d Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R- Wash.). (Alisha Jucevic\/Columbian\/AP) Republicans pushed back, airing their well-worn accusation that the health-care law was rotten to the core. \u201cThe problem is with the ship, not the deck chairs on the ship,\u201d said Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) The hearing was the fourth\u00a0panel House Democrats have recently convened for the purpose of slamming Republicans for trying to undercut the health-care law even after they failed in their promises to repeal and replace it. The House's Energy and Commerce health subcommittee and its\u00a0Education and Labor Committee\u00a0met Wednesday in separate hearings to highlight a lawsuit against the ACA from GOP-led states that could ultimately wipe out its protections for people with preexisting medical conditions. The Ways and Means Committee held a similar hearing last week. Some tweets from the Energy and Commerce hearing.\u00a0Via the Hill's Peter Sullivan:\u00a0 Author and journalist James Surowiecki: Charles Gaba, health-care analyst at ACASignups.net: But all of this politically fueled debate has less bearing on employer-sponsored coverage, under which\u00a0roughly half of all Americans get their insurance. The challenges in this space have often taken a back seat to arguments over Obamacare, even though workers are increasingly covered by plans that require them to dig ever deeper into their wallets. According to the Commonwealth survey, 28 percent of\u00a0people with coverage through their workplaces were \u201cunderinsured\u201d last year, meaning they faced out-of-pocket costs totaling at least 10 percent of their income (5 percent, if they were low-income). Twenty-four percent of these workers were underinsured in 2016. In contrast, the survey found incremental\u00a0improvements in this area among people who bought insurance on their own \u2014 even though Democrats have charged the opposite would be true. Forty-two percent of people purchasing individual market coverage were underinsured last year, compared with\u00a044 percent in 2016, before Trump took office. Now, Trump and his allies\u00a0haven\u2019t made additional progress in expanding coverage to more Americans \u2014 a marked success of the health-care law that has nonetheless stalled in recent years. And the effects of the administration's\u00a0new policies haven\u2019t yet been fully borne out. But so far, the administration may not have moved the needle significantly backward.

Kissel\/AP) OOF: In the push to implement Medicaid work requirements in several states, the Trump administration has so far failed to enforce federal rules meant to protect patients, the Los Angeles Times\u2019s Noam N. Levey reports. Out of the eight states approved to implement work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries, not one is set up with plans to track the effect of the change, including whether beneficiaries find jobs or see health improvements. \u201cAnd nine of the 17 states that have sought federal permission to implement Medicaid work mandates have been allowed by the Trump administration to proceed with their applications despite failing to calculate the number of people who could lose coverage, according to a review of state and federal Medicaid records,\u201d Noam writes. \u201cFederal regulations issued under the Obama administration direct states seeking permission to experiment with new Medicaid policies to, in most cases, estimate effects on coverage before the initiative starts, and then independently evaluate the impact of the programs after they begin to assure they are achieving their goals,\u201d Noam writes. Federal regulations from 2012\u00a0state applications to implement Medicaid experiments \u201cwill not be considered complete\u201d unless states make \u201can estimate of the expected increase or decrease in annual enrollment.\u201d But Noam reports\u00a0\u201cthe Trump administration deemed all the state Medicaid applications \u2018complete,\u2019 CMS documents show.\u201d William M.

The pair said they have started the process for a discharge petition, which would require at least 218 signatures in the House to pull a bill out of committee and force a floor vote. The \"Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act\" would require health-care providers to provide the same level of care to infants born during an abortion procedure as they would to any other infant and would require doctors and hospitals to report violations to law enforcement. \u201cCongress must act to protect those who cannot protect themselves,\u201d Wagner said in a statement. \u201cTo my colleagues, this is the simplest vote you will ever take: either you support babies being killed after they are born or you don\u2019t.

Legislation in Virginia and New York making it easier to obtain\u00a0a late-term abortion\u00a0has drawn recent attention to\u00a0questions around fetal viability and how late in pregnancy the procedure should be allowed. \u201cMedical advances have made this conflict more acute,\u201d our Post colleague Ariana Eunjung Cha reports.\u00a0\u201cWhen the Roe v. Wade decision was handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1973, it emphasized the concept of fetal viability -- the point at which a fetus might be able to survive outside the womb -- and that a woman\u2019s right to an abortion was not absolute. It gave states the right to restrict abortion after that time as long as there are exceptions for the endangerment of a woman\u2019s life or health.\u201d But fetal viability timing has progressed from around 24 to 28 weeks more than four decades ago to closer to 22 to 26 weeks now, Ariana notes. It\u2019s a change that Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor predicted, warning Roe v. Wade was \u201con a collision course with itself.\u201d \"The earliest-term baby known to survive was born at 21 weeks and 4 days of gestation,\" Ariana writes. \"The\u00a0girl, born in San Antonio to Courtney Stensrud, weighed a mere 0.9 pounds. Her skin was see-through, her lungs underdeveloped, and her eyes unable to focus. Obstetric guidelines do not recommend doctors resuscitate in this situation, but Stensrud asked them to try. Writing in the journal\u00a0Pediatrics\u00a0in December 2017, her doctors reported she had grown in to a healthy 2-year-old toddler but cautioned that this doesn\u2019t mean all babies born at this stage of development could be saved.\" In this explainer, Ariana answers more common questions about late-term abortions and the women who get them. \u00a0 Today During a House hearing on gun violence, Rep.

(Andrew Harnik\/AP) With Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0Time and time again, President Trump has campaigned like a populist but governed like a plutocrat. That\u2019s why it\u2019s more important to watch what his administration is doing than to listen to what he said during the State of the Union. \u201cThe agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda,\u201d Trump declared on Tuesday night at the top of his 82-minute speech. Promising a \u201cnew era of cooperation,\u201d he sounded at moments like a Republican in Name Only. Lines like these could very easily have been delivered by Barack Obama: -- \u201cIf the State of the Union address really articulated the policy stances of the administration, we would be talking about Trump\u2019s triangulation,\u201d observes National Review\u2019s Jim Geraghty. \u201cOn paper, the Trump administration and Congressional Democrats could find common ground and compromise on any of those policy priorities.\u201d -- But few lawmakers, in either party, take what Trump said on Tuesday literally or seriously. After all, this was the third time he\u2019s addressed a joint session of Congress. They remember that he called last year for paid family leave and $1.5 trillion of new infrastructure spending, but nothing came of either priority. They also know that he\u2019s gotten high marks for paeans to bipartisanship only to revert\u00a0to name-calling the next day. In this case, Trump ripped Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer repeatedly during the hours before the speech. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney waits on the House floor for Trump to deliver the State of the Union. (Toni L. Sandys\/The Washington Post) -- If you care more about reality than rhetoric, the Trump administration handed a big win to payday lenders yesterday that could hurt millions of low-income Americans each year. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, led by Trump appointee Kathy Kraninger, proposed significantly weakening Obama-era rules that were written to make it harder for payday lenders to trap the poor in a cycle of debt. \u201cUnder the existing rule, set to take effect in August, payday lenders would be required to take several steps to ensure borrowers can afford the loans they are being offered,\u201d Renae Merle reports. \u201cThe latest proposals would rescind that requirement and delay the rule\u2019s implementation until 2020. \u2026 Payday lenders aggressively lobbied lawmakers to block the rule last year and when that failed turned their attention to convincing the CFPB to change course. \u2026 \u201cUnder the Trump administration, the CFPB has softened its approach. It dropped several lawsuits against payday lenders last year and stripped enforcement powers from its fair lending office. While the loans are usually small, $350 to $500, they come with potential interest rates of 300 percent or more. About 12 million people take out such loans each year \u2026 The CFPB rule, finalized in 2017, was the first significant federal effort to regulate payday lenders and took more than five years to develop. When Trump appointee Mick Mulvaney took control of the bureau as acting director last year, the CFPB began to reconsider the regulations.\u201d Mulvaney is now White House chief of staff. Senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, the main author of the State of the Union, jotted down these notes as Trump talked\u00a0to reporters on Jan. 23. (Chip Somodevilla\/Getty Images) -- Trump\u2019s feel-good talk in the State of the Union about paid family leave, prescription drug prices and preexisting conditions polls well, but he didn\u2019t say it in a vacuum. In the same speech, he spoke in dark terms about immigrants, suggested Democrats are trying to push the country down a ruinous path toward socialism and called for curtailing women\u2019s reproductive rights. -- House Democrats, for their part, also just won their biggest gains since Watergate in the midterms, thanks almost entirely to the president\u2019s unpopularity. Many of these newly elected members don\u2019t want to cooperate with someone they portrayed as a corrupt villain during the campaign. -- Even if Trump was sincere about working in good faith with Democrats, the president has made life harder for himself by burning so many bridges. He forced a government shutdown on Dec. 21, when Republicans still controlled both chambers of Congress, in a futile attempt to get money for his border wall. After that gambit failed, he\u2019s now threatening to declare a national emergency so that he can divert funds that have been appropriated by Congress for other purposes, such as hurricane relief for Puerto Rico or military construction. This would face certain legal challenges. As a result of the 35-day shutdown, Trump has also missed the statutory deadline to submit a budget proposal to Congress \u2014 the budget he promises will call for eliminating HIV and curing cancer. -- Trump has earned a reputation among leaders of both parties \u2014 in the Senate and House \u2014 as an unreliable negotiating partner who moves the goal posts. In Tuesday\u2019s speech, Trump ad-libbed a line that wasn\u2019t in his prepared remarks. He claimed that he wants to welcome legal immigrants \u201cin the largest numbers ever.\u201d In fact, Trump has demanded major reductions to the number of legal immigrants allowed in. A year ago, when Democrats offered a compromise proposal that would have given him his wall, he said no because it didn\u2019t include dramatic cuts to legal immigration. -- The most newsworthy section of the State of the Union was Trump\u2019s Nixonian warning that \u201cridiculous partisan investigations\u201d would hurt the economy and imperil bipartisan cooperation. \u201cWith Thursday hearings scheduled on presidential tax returns and family separations at the Mexican border, and a Friday session to question acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker, the lights are about to shine brightly on a president who has, until now, faced little examination from a Republican Congress,\u201d Mike DeBonis and Seung Min Kim report. \u201cBut Democrats are moving carefully after spending weeks forming their committees, hiring staff and laying the groundwork for coming probes \u2014 mindful that Trump is eager to turn their investigations into a political boomerang as his critics demand swift action to uncover various alleged misdeeds.\u201d The president is lashing out at Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) after the Intelligence Committee he chairs opened a fresh investigation into Trump\u2019s foreign business entanglements. When a Fox News reporter asked about this yesterday, the president initially pretended that he doesn\u2019t know who Schiff is. Then he called him a \u201cpolitical hack.\u201d Schiff pledged that he will not be deterred by such invective. The former federal prosecutor said his team will investigate \u201ccredible reports of money laundering and financial compromise\u201d involving the president\u2019s companies and associates. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cHe outlined a five-point plan for the committee\u2019s investigation, encompassing Russia\u2019s election interference and the question of whether foreign governments have leverage over Trump, his relatives or associates. Schiff indicated the panel uncovered evidence of such vulnerabilities while under Republican leadership but neglected to pursue it. \u2026 The committee published its investigative plan after members voted unanimously Wednesday to give special counsel Robert S. Mueller III copies of all the interviews the committee conducted during its GOP-led probe.\u201d -- Teleprompter Trump never lasts for two main reasons: His choreographed speeches often don\u2019t fully reflect his true feelings, and he lacks the self-discipline required to stay on message. As widely expected, Twitter Trump has returned with a vengeance this morning. From Tuesday night\u2019s speech: \u201cWe can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future.\u201d From Twitter, just 36 hours later: Somewhere in Kalorama, I imagine, Obama is chuckling right now at the absurd claim that House Republicans didn\u2019t investigate him.

(Dave Sheinin) CHAOS IN THE COMMONWEALTH: -- Virginia\u2019s top three Democratic leaders are all embroiled in scandals this morning that threaten to end their political careers\u00a0after Attorney General Mark Herring disclosed that he appeared in blackface during\u00a0college. Gregory S. Schneider and Laura Vozzella report\u00a0from a reeling Richmond: \u201cThe drama pervaded the state capital on one of the busiest days of the General Assembly, with emotional meetings behind closed doors and at least one lawmaker in tears. Two of the central players hid from public view, while the third, [Lt. Gov. Justin] Fairfax, had no choice but to stand for hours on the dais of the Senate because of his job responsibilities. When they ended, he slipped away. \u2026 Just as political leaders were trying to digest the Herring news, the woman who has accused Fairfax of sexual assault made her first public statement, going into graphic detail about an alleged 2004 attack that Fairfax has vehemently denied.  \u201cWhile there was almost universal condemnation of [Gov. Ralph] Northam over the weekend after a racist photo from his 1984 medical school yearbook surfaced, the calls for his resignation paused Wednesday amid the new revelations about Herring and the intensifying Fairfax allegations. The Legislative Black Caucus, an influential group of Democrats who on Saturday had called for Northam to resign, went silent Wednesday. Republicans seemed unsure how to react. While the state party called on Herring to step down, it said nothing about Fairfax. ... \u201cThe statement from Fairfax\u2019s accuser, Vanessa Tyson, about an alleged sexual assault in Boston in 2004, ricocheted around Capitol Square. Some lawmakers who couldn\u2019t read the small type on a phone had an aide print it out and enlarge it for them. And that was only hours after they had seen the statement from Herring, in which he admitted to darkening his skin to dress as rapper Kurtis Blow for a 1980 college party when he was 19. \u2018It sounds ridiculous even now writing it,\u2019 Herring said in his statement. \u2018But because of our ignorance and glib attitudes \u2014 and because we did not have an appreciation for the experiences and perspectives of others \u2014 we dressed up and put on wigs and brown makeup.\u2019 \u2026 \u201cThe furor over his fellow Democrats fed Northam\u2019s impulse to stay put for now, according to two people familiar with his thinking \u2026 If Northam should step down, Fairfax would succeed him, and Herring would be next in line. The governor increasingly believes he should hang on at least through the end of the General Assembly session on Feb. 23 because stepping down now with such chaos at the executive level would create too much uncertainty regarding the budget and hundreds of pieces of pending legislation, the people said.\u201d -- If Northam, Herring and Fairfax all vacate their offices, then the Republican speaker of the state House, Kirk Cox, would be next in line to take over as governor.\u00a0Cox put out a cautious statement yesterday afternoon that stopped short of telling Herring or Fairfax to resign, but he said that the AG's behavior was \u201cshocking\u201d and that the allegations against the LG are \u201cextremely serious.\u201d -- Tyson said she chose to come forward with her account of the alleged assault after Fairfax described their encounter as \u201cconsensual.\u201d Samantha Schmidt, Fenit Nirappil and Laura Vozzella report: \u201cTyson said she met Fairfax on the first day of the 2004 Democratic National Convention and the pair soon realized they had a mutual friend. On the third day of the event, Tyson said Fairfax suggested she accompany him to his hotel room to pick up some documents. It was in that hotel room, she says, that he began to kiss her. \u2018Although surprised by his advance, it was not unwelcome and I kissed him back,\u2019 she said. But then, she says, he forced her to perform oral sex as she cried. \u2018Mr. Fairfax put his hand behind my neck and forcefully pushed my head towards his crotch,\u2019 she said.\u201d\u00a0Fairfax denied the allegation in a statement, saying:\u00a0\u201cReading Dr. Tyson\u2019s account is painful. I have never done anything like what she suggests.\u201d -- A double shot of deja vu: Tyson has hired the team that represented Christine Blasey Ford from the law firm Katz, Marshall & Banks, while Fairfax retained the lawyers\u00a0that represented Brett Kavanaugh at Wilkinson Walsh Eskovitz after the allegations against him were made.\u00a0 -- Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), the dean of the Virginia congressional delegation, learned of Tyson\u2019s allegation over a year ago. ABC News\u2019s Kaitlyn Folmer and John Verhovek report: \u201cAides to Scott confirm ... that Tyson first reached out him in an e-mail on October 20, 2017, expressing that she was \u2018not a fan\u2019 of then-candidate for Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax. \u2026 In a text message exchange between Scott and Tyson in December 2017, she informed him that the now-Lieutenant Governor-Elect had a \u2018MeToo allegation,\u2019 but at the time the congressman did not know that she was the accuser, according to aides. In late December 2017 and early January 2018, aides to Scott said he learned that it was Tyson herself who was involved in a \u2018MeToo allegation,\u2019 concerning Fairfax.\u201d -- The escalating scandals have shattered Virginia Democrats\u2019 expectations that they could take control of both houses of the General Assembly this fall. Paul Schwartzman reports: \u201cThe nature of the controversies \u2014 two involving racially offensive imagery, the other an alleged sexual assault \u2014 seem likely to alienate African American and female voters, two of the party\u2019s core constituencies. ...\u00a0Democrats said it is too early to predict what will happen in November. They pointed, perhaps as a source of comfort, to scandals that did not result in parties losing power, such as when then-Gov. Mark Sanford (R) of South Carolina acknowledged an extramarital affair.\u201d A surreal scene: \u201cSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), a former missionary and the 2016 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, [was] asked by a reporter Wednesday whether he had \u2018ever worn blackface.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 the senator replied, \u2018I never have, never have. I grew up in Kansas City and it just wasn\u2019t something that was done.\u2019\u201d -- The Washington Post\u2019s Editorial Board, which\u00a0endorsed Northam in his primary race and general election, calls on the governor to resign:\u00a0Northam\u00a0\u201ccan no longer effectively serve the people of Virginia who elected him. His shifting and credulity-shredding explanations for the racist photograph on his medical school yearbook page, and the silence into which he then succumbed for days \u2014 after initially promising to do \u2018the hard work\u2019 of atonement and apology to restore his standing with Virginians \u2014 is simply too much. \u2026 In the case of Mr. Northam, the circumstances are decisive; what\u2019s done cannot be undone. He must go.\u201d -- Every vote counts! Remember that coin toss to determine the winner of a Virginia House seat? It could come back to haunt Democrats if Northam, Fairfax and Herring all step aside. From Philip Bump: \u201cAt the end of the night on Election Day [in 2017], it wasn\u2019t clear which party would control [the Virginia House of Delegates]. Ultimately, it came down to one seat, Virginia\u2019s 94th District, where Democrat Shelly Simonds emerged from a recount with a one-vote margin over the incumbent Del. David E. Yancey (R). \u2026 A panel of judges determined that a vote that had been discarded should be given to Yancey, resulting in a tie. How to resolve the tie? By drawing names from a ceramic bowl. Both names were placed in the bowl, Yancey\u2019s was picked, and Republicans retained control of the chamber. And Cox got to be speaker. And now Cox is third in line to the governorship.\u201d Paul Erickson's girlfriend, Maria Butina, is shown next to her attorney during a courtroom sketch from Dec. 13. (Dana Verkouteren\/AP) FOLLOW THE MONEY: -- Republican operative Paul Erickson, the boyfriend of\u00a0Russian agent Maria Butina\u00a0and the manager of Pat Buchanan's 1992 presidential campaign, was indicted on charges related to an alleged investment fraud scheme. Devlin Barrett and Rosalind S. Helderman report: \u201cThe new charges against Erickson are not connected to Russia. He is charged in an 11-count indictment with wire fraud and money laundering by raising money from investors for what prosecutors say were false claims about a company that would build senior residential care facilities. Erickson also scammed investors by claiming to be developing a wheelchair that allowed people to go to the bathroom without being lifted out of the chair, according to the indictment. \u2026One of the money transfers listed in the indictment as an instance of money laundering is a $20,472 payment Erickson made in June 2017 to American University \u2014 the school Butina attended.\u201d He pleaded not guilty. -- Newly uncovered details show that\u00a0Sergei Millian, identified as one of the sources for the Steele dossier, had more access to Trump associates during the 2016 campaign than previously known. Rosalind S. Helderman and Tom Hamburger report: \u201cAround the time of [Trump\u2019s] inauguration, two of his supporters met to toast the new administration at the Russia House, a Washington restaurant known among Russian diplomats and emigres for its vodka and caviar. The Dupont Circle spot was suggested by Sergei Millian, according to onetime Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who said he met with the Belarus-born businessman there. The get-together followed months of outreach Millian had made to the young aide \u2014 including offering him a lucrative consulting contract to work simultaneously for Trump and an unidentified Russian, which Papadopoulos said he rebuffed. \u2026 \u201cAs he was working to build a relationship with Papadopoulos in 2016, Millian also offered to serve as a conduit to the Trump campaign for a Belarusan author in Florida with connections to the Russian government, according to emails obtained by The Washington Post. The author, Mikhail Morgulis, who said he never ended up hearing from anyone in the campaign, later claimed that he rallied Russian Americans to back Trump. The new details deepen the persistent mystery surrounding Millian, two years after he was identified as one of the unnamed sources in a campaign dossier Steele compiled for Democrats about Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.\u201d -- The investigation of the president\u2019s inaugural committee has raised questions about why Imaad Zuberi, a venture capitalist who donated more than $600,000 to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, rapidly transformed himself into a Trump supporter. Rosalind S. Helderman, Michael Kranish and Tom Hamburger report: \u201cThe inquiry has put a spotlight on a prolific donor with extensive foreign ties \u2014 particularly in the Middle East \u2014 who has doled out millions to politicians over the past 15 years, according to campaign finance records. \u2026 With his wife, Willa Rao, he donated more than $2 million to Democratic candidates and committees between 2004 and 2016, sums that put him in the upper echelon of fundraisers for Obama and Hillary Clinton. Since Trump\u2019s election, the couple\u2019s giving has flipped: They have contributed $1.78 million to Republicans and just $206,000 to Democrats, records show.\u201d -- A Ukrainian-Russian developer said Trump wanted $20 million in 2006 for his name to be used on a tower in Moscow. Bloomberg News\u2019s Stephanie Baker reports: Pavel\u00a0Fuks \u201csaid he hosted Trump\u2019s children, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., in Moscow in 2006 to discuss the project after meeting with the elder Trump several times in the U.S. By his account, Fuks offered to pay Trump $10 million in installments, but Trump demanded $20 million up front for the right to use the Trump name on a Moscow development. \u2018He said $20 million is nothing,\u2019 Fuks recalled. \u2018I said, no, it\u2019s a lot of money. We couldn\u2019t agree.\u2019\u201d -- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is in talks to testify before the House Financial Services Committee about the controversial deal to ease sanctions on the businesses controlled by Vladimir Putin pal Oleg Deripaska. Politico\u2019s Zachary Warmbrodt and Andrew Desiderio report: Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) \u201ccalled on Mnuchin to testify amid complaints by Democrats that Treasury failed to deliver documents they requested regarding the department's decision to lift penalties targeting the billionaire Russian oligarch. Waters and Mnuchin spoke by phone Wednesday and are working to find a \u2018mutually agreeable date\u2019 for him to appear before the committee, a Treasury spokesperson said. In the interim, Treasury is in the process of responding to the document request, according to the spokesperson.\u201d -- Documents from Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel show T-Mobile executives have booked at least 52 nights at the hotel since it\u00a0requested approval for a mega-merger with Sprint. Jonathan O'Connell, David A. Fahrenthold and Mike DeBonis report: \u201cThe revelations come as political scrutiny of the proposed deal is mounting on Capitol Hill. On Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) issued letters demanding information about the T-Mobile executives\u2019 stays and whether Trump was informed of them. The issue is likely to come up at House subcommittee hearings on the merger next week. \u2026 [One Trump hotel] document showed that when [CEO John] Legere stayed at Trump\u2019s hotel for two nights last month, his room had a rate of $2,246 per night.\u201d THE IMMIGRATION WARS:  -- The bipartisan committee working to craft a deal on border security edged closer to a compromise that would avert a government shutdown next week.\u00a0But there is no guarantee Trump will back it. Erica Werner, John Wagner, Mike DeBonis and Elise Viebeck report: The committee\u00a0\u201ctraded offers behind the scenes, with Democrats saying money for border barriers was on the table and Republicans acknowledging they won\u2019t get Trump the $5.7 billion he has sought for his wall. Lawmakers hope to have a tentative deal by Friday or soon thereafter, to allow time for the legislation to pass the House and Senate by Feb. 15. \u2026 Few on Capitol Hill are eager to prolong the uncertainty by passing yet another stopgap spending bill. \u2026 Inside the Capitol, there is cautious optimism that the conference committee, which is stacked with experienced negotiators from both parties, can reach a deal. But members acknowledge they cannot be certain that Trump will support their product, especially after his change of heart in late December.\u201d -- Nancy Pelosi predicted the government would not shut down again. Politico\u2019s Heather Caygle, Sarah Ferris and John Bresnahan report: \u201c\u2018There will not be another shutdown,\u2019 Pelosi confidently asserted during a half-hour interview Wednesday in her Capitol office. \u2018No, it\u2019s not going to happen.\u2019 \u2018I have a club that I started, it\u2019s called the \u2018Too Hot to Handle Club.\u2019 And this is a too-hot-to-handle issue,\u2019 Pelosi quipped. Pelosi said she believes a bipartisan House-Senate panel negotiating on border security will come to an agreement before the Feb. 15 funding deadline. And she pledged to support any deal that emerges from those talks, even as she remains firm that there won\u2019t be new money for Trump\u2019s wall.\u201d -- Figures from the Pentagon indicate Trump\u2019s deployment of troops to the border could cost up to $1 billion by the end of the fiscal year. Paul Sonne reports: \u201cThat estimate comes from combining figures the Department of Defense has released and estimates from outside experts to fill in the gaps. \u2026 All told, the cost of the deployments would approach $1 billion at the minimum estimate by the end of September, as long as the troop presence and activity level aren\u2019t altered significantly. The figure is within the range of at least one past deployment. President George W. Bush deployed up to 6,000 National Guard troops to border states during Operation Jump Start from 2006 to 2008 at a cost of $1.2 billion, according to the Government Accountability Office.\u201d -- Meanwhile, the Pentagon announced it would move 250 active-duty troops to Texas in advance of the arrival of a new migrant caravan. NBC News\u2019s Courtney Kube and Carol E. Lee report: \u201cThe move reflects [Trump's] mention of a \u2018human wall,\u2019 but comes amid increasing frustration among Pentagon leaders with the continued border requests from Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Under the new directive, the troops will be moved from Arizona to Texas and \u2014 in a sign of the Pentagon's frustrations \u2014 will not represent an increase in the overall number of U.S. troops assigned to the border mission.\u201d -- Inaccurate claims by state officials in Texas that as many as 58,000 noncitizens may have voted underscore how some Republicans have exaggerated allegations of voter fraud in recent years. Amy Gardner reports: \u201cIn North Carolina, legislative leaders said in 2014 that more than 10,000 suspected noncitizens were registered to vote, but state election officials found that number was vastly overstated and determined that only 11 noncitizens voted that fall. In Florida in 2012, a list of 180,000 possible noncitizens ultimately led to the removal of 85 voters from the rolls. Similar claims have been made in Colorado, Indiana and Kansas.\u201d -- Correction: A photo of lawmakers watching Trump deliver the State of the Union, which appeared above the immigration wars section in yesterday\u2019s edition, was taken during last year\u2019s speech. Thanks to the many eagle-eyed readers who noticed because Ted Cruz didn\u2019t have a beard and Scott Pruitt was sitting among the Cabinet secretaries. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)\u00a0listens to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\u00a0testify during his confirmation hearing last September. (Melina Mara\/The Washington Post) 2020 WATCH: --\u00a0\u201cAt least three people have withdrawn from consideration to lead Sen. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s nascent 2020 presidential campaign \u2014 and done so in part because of the Minnesota Democrat\u2019s history of mistreating her staff,\u201d HuffPost\u2019s Molly Redden and Amanda Terkel report in a new story ahead of her expected announcement on Sunday. \u201cSome former Klobuchar staffers, all of whom spoke \u2026 on condition of anonymity, describe Klobuchar as habitually demeaning and prone to bursts of cruelty that make it difficult to work in her office for long. \u2026 Klobuchar\u2019s office consistently has one of the highest rates of staff turnover in the Senate. From 2001 to 2016, she ranked No. 1 in the Senate for staff turnover as measured by LegiStorm. \u2026 \u201cIt is common for staff to wake up to multiple emails from Klobuchar characterizing one\u2019s work as \u2018the worst\u2019 briefing or press release she\u2019d seen in her decades of public service, according to two former aides and emails \u2026 Although some staffers grew inured to her constant put-downs (\u2018It\u2019s always \u201cthe worst,\u201d\u2019 one said sarcastically, \u2018It was \u201cthe worst\u201d\u00a0one two weeks ago\u2019), others found it grinding and demoralizing. Adding to the humiliation, Klobuchar often cc\u2019d large groups of staffers who weren\u2019t working on the topic at hand, giving the emails the effect of a public flogging. \u201cA former employee in her Senate office recalled her struggling to find an outside candidate to replace an outgoing chief of staff. A staffer in another Hill office recounted losing interest in a job opening with Klobuchar when a current staffer, the one conducting the interview, conveyed that avoiding Klobuchar\u2019s anger was a significant part of the job. \u2026 Three former staffers said Klobuchar has tasked them or their co-workers with performing personal errands, such as making her personal appointments, washing dishes at her home or picking up her dry cleaning. \u201cThe reality of working for Klobuchar is at odds with the Midwestern-nice image she has cultivated in public \u2026 One morning several years ago, when most of the office staff was running late \u2026 Klobuchar wrote out tardy slips and placed them on each missing aide\u2019s desk. The staffer recalls incredulous bursts of laughter as her co-workers arrived one by one to find the notes, but Klobuchar was deadly serious. An aide whom she called into her office walked back out in tears. \u2018She was constantly lighting new fires,\u2019 a former staffer said, sometimes at the expense of focusing on legislative work.\u201d -- The revelation that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) identified herself as \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d on a 1986 bar registration card has resuscitated an issue she has repeatedly tried to put to rest. Annie Linskey and Amy Gardner report: \u201cFor Democrats, the issue was long eclipsed by anger at Trump\u2019s ridicule of Warren, especially his use of the nickname \u2018Pocahontas.\u2019 But Warren\u2019s presidential run, coming as she has struggled to explain her past claims of Native American identity, has prompted some Democrats to take a harder look at her own actions. The matter now threatens to overshadow the image Warren has sought to foster of a truth-telling consumer advocate who would campaign for the White House as a champion for the working class. Instead, she is now seeking to combat the portrait of someone who for years was insufficiently sensitive to a long-oppressed minority.\u201d -- The time Beto O\u2019Rourke spent in New York in his early 20s, when he was somewhat rootless and depressed about his lack of meaningful work, reflect his presidential deliberations now. The New York Times\u2019s Matt Flegenheimer reports: \u201cBy late 1995, Mr. O\u2019Rourke had fallen into the deepest depression he can remember. He worked for an uncle\u2019s tech business because it was a job. He spent nights alone listening to his cassettes because it passed the time. \u2026 Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s New York chapter has stood as the unlikely forerunner to his political rise, laying bare the unusual path that led him to national politics and the who-should-I-be self-reflection that has come to define his presidential deliberations. \u2026 Then, as now, he appeared less concerned with political ideology than the pursuit of authentic experiences and a sense of community, an instinct that has frustrated some progressive voters who question Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s policy convictions.\u201d -- Top Democrats in early-voting states say they have not heard anything from Joe Biden or his allies. BuzzFeed News\u2019s Henry J. Gomez reports: \u201cBiden\u2019s plans remain a mystery to state and county party chairs, as well as other prominent activists ... Many said they\u2019re not even in touch with close advisers or allies who would have to spring to action if and when Biden announces. \u2026 Activists in Iowa, which will hold the first caucuses in less than a year, stressed that Biden is well-liked there and that many Democrats are likely to wait to see what he does before pledging support to another candidate. But the lack of contact leaves them with little more than gossip.\u201d -- Biden has been reaching out to his former congressional colleagues about his 2020 prospects. Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett and Heather Caygle report: \u201cBiden has an established fan base among Democratic lawmakers, particularly in the Senate, where he served for 36 years. The outreach indicates that Biden is looking to lock down establishment support on the front end of a campaign to give him an edge in a splintered field. On Sunday, Biden spoke by phone with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has said publicly she\u2019d back him if he decides to run. Biden signaled that he was sketching out both a campaign apparatus and spoke with urgency about the race, Feinstein said in an interview. \u2018I think we\u2019ll hear from him within a month,\u2019 Feinstein said.\u201d -- Since his 2016 presidential bid, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has worked to bolster his foreign policy chops with the help of a key staffer, Matt Duss. The Nation\u2019s David Klion reports: \u201cIn his 2016 campaign, Sanders\u2019s primary focus was on domestic economic issues, and many critics regarded him as a lightweight on foreign policy. This time around, Sanders has won over skeptics in the foreign-policy establishment with substantive speeches in\u00a02017\u00a0and\u00a02018, laying out a comprehensive vision for America\u2019s role in the world. Beyond wanting to end or prevent wars in the Middle East, Sanders has also linked the global rise of authoritarian populism to wealth inequality, and has called for an international progressive movement to combat authoritarian leaders and kleptocrats from Russia to Brazil. And while Duss doesn\u2019t want to take credit for what he says are his boss\u2019s deeply held views, he has had a hand in all of this.\u201d -- Rep. Carolyn Maloney cast doubt on whether one of her fellow New York Democrats,\u00a0Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand,\u00a0could win a presidential general election. \u201cI'm not supporting her because I feel, at this point, I feel that we have to win Ohio and Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cAnd if we win Ohio, we win the presidency, in my belief. So I am very interested in candidates that I believe can win Ohio.\u201d She added, \u201cI'm focused on who can win Ohio. I want to win. I don't want to lose. I want to win.\u201d Maloney later appeared to somewhat backtrack. \u201cKirsten Gillibrand is an outstanding Senator and would be an exceptional President,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI was simply commenting on the importance of winning back previously blue states and having a strategy for doing so.\u201d (New York Daily News) -- The president will address the National Prayer Breakfast today, where he is expected to play up the promises he has kept to conservative evangelicals. Sarah Pulliam Bailey and Julie Zauzmer report: \u201cWhenever he takes the stage in front of conservative Christians, Trump uses those opportunities to remind them of his promises, like appointing Supreme Court justices who could help overturn Roe v. Wade and making \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 a more common greeting during the holidays. \u2026 For the past two years, Trump has used the [National Prayer Breakfast] speech to reiterate the promises he has made that speak to a core concern among many conservative Christians: that their influence is waning and that their livelihoods could even come under attack.\u201d -- Trump\u2019s reelection campaign is talking to potential communications staffers to prepare for attacks from Democratic candidates. CNBC\u2019s Brian Schwartz reports: \u201cTrump's team has been interviewing dozens of candidates for positions ranging from communications director to press secretary, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Some candidates who have discussed jobs with the campaign currently work in the White House, according to the sources, who declined to be named. The campaign is expected to officially announce the new additions in the coming weeks, one source said.\u201d -- CNN will host a town hall with Howard Schultz next week. He will take questions from Texas voters in Houston on Tuesday. (CNN) THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- The United States is scaling back its security\u00a0assistance to Cameroon over allegations of human rights violations against the country\u2019s military. Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady reports: \u201cCameroon is a key U.S. security partner, and about 300 U.S. troops are based there to train and assist the Cameroonian military, including in its fight against extremism in its far northern region. Human rights groups have reported that Cameroonian security forces have targeted civilians, in the far north and in the country\u2019s unstable southwest and northwest regions, where the military is battling English-speaking separatists fighting to create a breakaway nation called Ambazonia.\u201d -- The conflict between Cameroon\u2019s French and English speakers has already resulted in the deaths of hundreds. Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady reports: \u201cAround 80 percent of the country speaks French; the rest speaks English. For decades, Francophones and Anglophones lived in relative harmony. But over the past two years, violence spurred by this linguistic split has brought Cameroon to the brink of civil war. \u2026 The government claims armed English-speaking separatists who want to create a new nation called Ambazonia have terrorized civilians and attacked government forces, prompting the military to retaliate against them. But in more than a dozen interviews, English speakers displaced by military raids on their villages recounted how Cameroonian troops opened fire on unarmed civilians and burned down their homes.\u201d -- U.S. and North Korean officials are still negotiating about where Trump and Kim Jong Un will meet in Vietnam. David Nakamura, John Hudson and Anne Gearan report: \u201cU.S. officials are pushing for Danang, a coastal resort city Trump visited in November 2017 for a regional economic summit. Relatively isolated, Danang offers better security planning and keeps the focus squarely on the tough nuclear negotiations. The North Koreans, however, have their sights set on Hanoi, the bustling northern capital, which could afford Kim an opportunity to hold a separate bilateral meeting with the Vietnamese leadership. That would continue his dramatic coming-out party on the world stage; in addition to Trump, Kim has met over the past year with the leaders of South Korea, China and Singapore.\u201d -- Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro blocked humanitarian aid shipments as he fights to hold on to power, prompting a rebuke from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mariana Zu\u00f1iga reports: \u201cThe United States, which has called for Maduro\u2019s ouster and recognized National Assembly head Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader, has been coordinating with other countries in the region to deliver food and other provisions to Venezuela for the benefit of the people. But on Wednesday, ahead of anticipated aid shipments, a bridge that would have been an entry point into Venezuela from Colombia was blocked by a tanker truck and two shipping containers placed horizontally across its lanes.\u201d -- Juan Guaid\u00f3 plans to name a new board for Citgo in an effort to deprive Maduro\u2019s regime of oil revenue. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jessica Donati, Ian Talley and Andrew Scurria report: \u201cThe company, a major U.S. refinery, is owned by state oil giant Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela SA. Citgo is being forced to consider the possibility of bankruptcy and other contingency plans in the fight for control of Venezuela\u2019s assets. \u2026 The effort to set up a new Citgo board, however, faces potential legal, diplomatic and logistical complications. Citgo executives aligned with the U.S. have been in intensive talks with legal advisers, Guaid\u00f3 officials and the Trump administration to work out a plan to prevent a major disruption in operations, according to people familiar with the matter.\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) sparked outrage after he used a congressional hearing on gun violence to call for the construction of a wall and to suggest\u00a0that two\u00a0fathers of children who died during the\u00a0Parkland shooting\u00a0should be removed from the committee room. \u201cThe panel was discussing H.R. 8, a bipartisan measure introduced in the House last month that would require background checks for all gun sales and most gun transfers,\u201d Felicia Sonmez reports. \u201c\u2018As we hear the stories and circumstances for those here, I hope we do not forget the pain and anguish and sense of loss felt by those all over the country who have been the victims of violence at the hands of illegal aliens,\u2019 Gaetz said. \u2026 Two Parkland fathers, Manuel Oliver and Fred Guttenberg, were seated in the audience. Oliver, who lost his son Joaquin in the shooting, stood up and protested Gaetz\u2019s remarks; Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed, also spoke out. \u2026 Later, Gaetz pointed his finger at Oliver and Guttenberg, asking whether there is a committee process that calls for audience members to be ejected for repeatedly interrupting members.\u201d Republicans, meanwhile, were outraged that Democrats didn't allow testimony from House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, who opposes new gun-control laws even after he got shot in Alexandria: Rep.

Many VA medical centers also stacked up better on prevention of post-surgical complications such as blood clots. At the same time, dozens had higher rates of preventable infections and severe bed sores \u2013 a sign of potential neglect. And nearly every VA performed worse than other medical providers on industry-standard patient satisfaction surveys.\u201d HOT ON THE LEFT: \u201c\u2018This is not Russia,\u2019 Rep.

Manchin, who represents a state Trump won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016, was speaking with students from Webster County High School by video chat from his office when the president called, he said in a tweet. Trump \u2018took time out of his schedule to talk to the students over speakerphone,\u2019 Manchin said. While Manchin is a Democrat, he often backs parts of Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d \u00a0 DAYBOOK: Trump will address the National Prayer Breakfast this morning.

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is running for president on a plan to give newborn babies savings accounts worth tens of thousands for when they turn 18, a suite of criminal justice reforms and policies to enact \u201cclimate justice,\u201d including a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d to confront climate change, according to his policy aides. Booker, who announced his presidential bid Friday, will also campaign on a pilot program to create a federal jobs guarantee, a plan to stop anti-competitive hiring practices and monopolies, and a refundable housing credit program that would aim to help Americans struggling to pay rent. Booker\u2019s sweeping criminal justice reform plans include legalizing marijuana, reducing workplace discrimination against those who have been convicted of crimes, giving federal money to areas the government determines were most hurt by the war on drugs, and improving the treatment of incarcerated women, among a host of other policies, aides said. Booker has also announced his support for the Medicare-for-all plan by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to nationalize the health-insurance industry and provide universal government insurance. \u201cBooker and his team are engaged with tangible policies that can really change our trajectory of hoarding resources among the elite to a more egalitarian, inclusive economy,\u201d said Darrick Hamilton, a professor of economics and urban policy at the New School who has worked closely with Booker and his staff. But Booker is likely to face intense criticism from the right over the costs of his proposed policies, which would add trillions to the federal debt at a time of already unusually high annual deficits. And on the left, Booker has faced scrutiny primarily for some of his previous votes, actions and statements \u2014 including criticizing President Barack Obama for being too hard on Wall Street, taking millions of dollars in money from financial interests, voicing support for charter schools and voting against a plan to allow the importation of prescription drugs from Canada. (Booker\u2019s office has said he supports drug importation from Canada, but with appropriate safeguards.) Here\u2019s a look at some of the policy ideas Booker is hoping can power him to the White House. Baby bonds. As first reported by Vox in October 2018, Booker is proposing \u201cbaby bonds\u201d to give each child in the United States a savings account with $1,000. The account would grow in size every year, depending on the income of the child\u2019s family, to as much as $50,000. When the child turns 18, that money could be used for a number of things but not anything \u2014 including a down payment on a house or money to go to college. One estimate from Columbia University researcher Naomi Zewde found that baby bonds would come close to wiping out the racial wealth gap, in part by increasing the assets held by young people across the board. \u201cIt\u2019s framed with the idea everybody should have a birthright to capital,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI\u2019d call it racial-conscious economic justice.\u201d  But the program could face some objections. For one, the full benefits of the program would not be disbursed for close to two decades after its passage, which may make it easier for future Republican governments to eliminate the program without political consequences. (The program will start disbursing smaller annual supplemental benefits to those who were born after the law\u2019s enactment, to prevent a \u201chigh stakes cut off\u201d in which kids born one year too late would miss out in the program\u2019s large benefits. For example, a child who is 10 when the law is enacted will receive eight years worth of benefits at 18.) When the smaller but similar Child Trust Fund was implemented in Britain, it was axed during the Great Recession. Some experts have also cast doubt on the extent to which the plan would reduce racial inequality. Matt Bruenig, founder of the socialist think tank the People\u2019s Policy Project, has argued that the baby bonds proposal would \u201conly modestly\u201d reduce the racial wealth gap. \u201cThe total wealth gap between the black and white population is over $15 trillion. A program that annually pays out $80 billion of race-neutral grants is not going to nearly close it,\u201d Bruenig wrote. Array of sweeping criminal justice proposals. Booker has also proposed a suite of measures on criminal justice, expressing outrage that America is home to \u201cjust 5 percent of the world\u2019s population, but 25 percent of the world\u2019s prison population.\u201d  The senator has introduced at least 10 separate bills regarding criminal justice, including legislation intended to end the prohibition on marijuana; reduce discrimination in the hiring of former convicts; bring transparency and data to police shootings; and improve funding for the offices of public defenders, who are often overworked and underfunded. Criminal justice advocates in particular pointed to Booker\u2019s \u201creverse mass incarceration\u201d bill, which would give states financial incentives to reduce prison populations \u2014 a reversal of the 1994 crime bill that encouraged states to increase them, according to advocates. \u201cIt\u2019s the most potent bill introduced in Congress to date to actually end mass incarceration,\u201d said Inimai M. Chettiar, director of the justice program at the Brennan Center for Justice. Booker also had a role in pushing the criminal justice overhaul signed by President Trump last fall, particularly its shortening of sentences for some offenders and expanded job training for prisoners, among other changes. Booker\u2019s aides say he successfully fought to include the effective elimination of solitary confinement of juveniles in detention, as well as bans on the shackling of pregnant inmates and guarantees of the provision of health-care products for incarcerated women. Federal officials have since mandated all women behind bars receive tampons and pads free of charge. Monopoly power. Booker\u2019s office has also released multiple proposals aimed at combating what they call the rising consolidation of various industries in the hands of a few companies. Booker introduced one anti-merger bill that would impose a moratorium on mergers of large grocery companies and farms. In 2017, the senator spoke on the need for antitrust action against Google. Matt Stoller, an antitrust advocate at the Open Markets Institute, credited Booker with linking a decline in independent black-owned businesses and small independent rural farms to corporate consolidation in a novel way. \u201cIt\u2019s a sophisticated populist argument about the coalition he\u2019s trying to put together, and no one else has articulated that,\u201d Stoller said. Booker, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), has introduced legislation to ban \u201cno poaching\u201d agreements slipped into contracts at chains that prevent workers from switching between a company\u2019s franchises. Critics say they drive down wages by inhibiting employee mobility. Non-poaching clauses are now included in up to 56 percent of large franchises, up about 20 percent from two decades ago, according to Alan Krueger of Princeton University and Eric Posner of the University of Chicago. Jobs guarantee pilot. In April 2018, Booker said he would introduce a bill that would create a pilot program for a \u201cjob guarantee\u201d in 15 rural and urban areas across the country. The idea, according to job guarantee supporters, is to provide a buffer against economic downturns by having the government ensure that Americans who want a job can find one. Booker\u2019s plan would create a three-year pilot through the Labor Department for jobs that pay at least $15 an hour \u2014 jobs that could then fulfill some certain social vacuum, like building parks or schools. Sanders has also announced a plan to create a jobs guarantee for every U.S. worker. That program, which is not a pilot, would be much bigger in scope. Medicare-for-all. In September 2018, Booker announced his support for Sanders\u2019s Medicare-for-all bill to nationalize health insurance. Medicare-for-all is a proposal to move every American to a single government-run insurer that charges no deductibles or premiums. Doing so would significantly increase government expenditures \u2014 by as much as $33 trillion over a 10-year period, according to one conservative think tank\u2019s estimate \u2014 while offering health insurance to the Americans who lack it and preventing millions more from being forced into medical bankruptcy. It would require enormous tax increases to finance, although supporters maintain that they would be offset by zeroing out every family\u2019s spending on premiums and deductibles. At least four other declared presidential candidates \u2014 including Sens. Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) \u2014 also say they support Medicare-for-all.","20":"Michael Cohen is set to deliver a stemwinder of an opening statement Wednesday morning to the House Oversight Committee in his debut public testimony. Cohen will say his former boss President Trump is \u201cracist\" and a \u201cconman.\u201d He will say that Trump personally signed a check to cover the costs of the Stormy Daniels hush-money payment, and that he knew about political adviser Roger Stone\u2019s outreach to WikiLeaks during the 2016 election. Below is the full statement, which was first reported by Politico and the New York Times and confirmed as authentic by The Post. It is subject to last-minute changes. To see an annotation, click on the yellow, highlighted text. (Can\u2019t see the yellow highlights? Click here.) Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today. I have asked this Committee to ensure that my family be protected from Presidential threats, and that the Committee be sensitive to the questions pertaining to ongoing investigations. Thank you for your help and for your understanding. I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the Committee\u2019s questions truthfully, and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump. I recognize that some of you may doubt and attack me on my credibility. It is for this reason that I have incorporated into this opening statement documents that are irrefutable, and demonstrate that the information you will hear is accurate and truthful. Never in a million years did I imagine, when I accepted a job in 2007 to work for Donald Trump, that he would one day run for President, launch a campaign on a platform of hate and intolerance, and actually win. I regret the day I said \u201cyes\u201d to Mr. Trump. I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way. I am ashamed of my own failings, and I publicly accepted responsibility for them by pleading guilty in the Southern District of New York. I am ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty \u2013 of the things I did for Mr. Trump in an effort to protect and promote him. I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump\u2019s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience. I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat. He was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails. I will explain each in a few moments. I am providing the Committee today with several documents. These include: I hope my appearance here today, my guilty plea, and my work with law enforcement agencies are steps along a path of redemption that will restore faith in me and help this country understand our president better. *** Before going further, I want to apologize to each of you and to Congress as a whole. The last time I appeared before Congress, I came to protect Mr. Trump. Today, I\u2019m here to tell the truth about Mr. Trump. I lied to Congress about when Mr. Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016. That was false \u2013 our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign. Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That\u2019s not how he operates. In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there\u2019s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie. There were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa Caucus in January 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me \u201cHow\u2019s it going in Russia?\u201d \u2013 referring to the Moscow Tower project. You need to know that Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. To be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project. And so I lied about it, too \u2013 because Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress. **** Over the past two years, I have been smeared as \u201ca rat\u201d by the President of the United States. The truth is much different, and let me take a brief moment to introduce myself. My name is Michael Dean Cohen. I am a blessed husband of 24 years and a father to an incredible daughter and son. When I married my wife, I promised her that I would love her, cherish her, and protect her. As my father said countless times throughout my childhood, \u201cyou my wife, and you my children, are the air that I breathe.\u201d To my Laura, my Sami, and my Jake, there is nothing I wouldn\u2019t do to protect you. I have always tried to live a life of loyalty, friendship, generosity, and compassion \u2013 qualities my parents ingrained in my siblings and me since childhood. My father survived the Holocaust thanks to the compassion and selfless acts of others. He was helped by many who put themselves in harm\u2019s way to do what they knew was right. That is why my first instinct has always been to help those in need. Mom and Dad\u2026I am sorry that I let you down. As many people that know me best would say, I am the person they would call at 3AM if they needed help. I proudly remember being the emergency contact for many of my children\u2019s friends when they were growing up because their parents knew that I would drop everything and care for them as if they were my own. Yet, last fall I pled guilty in federal court to felonies for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in coordination with Individual #1. For the record: Individual #1 is President Donald J. Trump. It is painful to admit that I was motivated by ambition at times. It is even more painful to admit that many times I ignored my conscience and acted loyal to a man when I should not have. Sitting here today, it seems unbelievable that I was so mesmerized by Donald Trump that I was willing to do things for him that I knew were absolutely wrong. For that reason, I have come here to apologize to my family, to the government, and to the American people. *** Accordingly, let me now tell you about Mr. Trump. I got to know him very well, working very closely with him for more than 10 years, as his Executive Vice President and Special Counsel and then personal attorney when he became President. When I first met Mr. Trump, he was a successful entrepreneur, a real estate giant, and an icon. Being around Mr. Trump was intoxicating. When you were in his presence, you felt like you were involved in something greater than yourself -- that you were somehow changing the world. I wound up touting the Trump narrative for over a decade. That was my job. Always stay on message. Always defend. It monopolized my life. At first, I worked mostly on real estate developments and other business transactions. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Trump brought me into his personal life and private dealings. Over time, I saw his true character revealed. Mr. Trump is an enigma. He is complicated, as am I. He has both good and bad, as do we all. But the bad far outweighs the good, and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself. He is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal. Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation \u2013 only to market himself and to build his wealth and power. Mr. Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the \u201cgreatest infomercial in political history.\u201d He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign \u2013 for him \u2013 was always a marketing opportunity. I knew early on in my work for Mr. Trump that he would direct me to lie to further his business interests. I am ashamed to say, that when it was for a real estate mogul in the private sector, I considered it trivial. As the President, I consider it significant and dangerous. But in the mix, lying for Mr. Trump was normalized, and no one around him questioned it. In fairness, no one around him today questions it, either. A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes. As I earlier stated, Mr. Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails. In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump\u2019s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of \u201cwouldn\u2019t that be great.\u201d Mr. Trump is a racist. The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries \u201cshitholes.\u201d In private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn\u2019t a \u201cshithole.\u201d This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States. While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid. And yet I continued to work for him. Mr. Trump is a cheat. As previously stated, I\u2019m giving the Committee today three years of President Trump\u2019s financial statements, from 2011-2013, which he gave to Deutsche Bank to inquire about a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills and to Forbes. These are Exhibits 1a, 1b, and 1c to my testimony. It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes. I am sharing with you two newspaper articles, side by side, that are examples of Mr. Trump inflating and deflating his assets, as I said, to suit his financial interests. These are Exhibit 2 to my testimony. As I noted, I\u2019m giving the Committee today an article he wrote on, and sent me, that reported on an auction of a portrait of Mr. Trump. This is Exhibit 3A to my testimony. Mr. Trump directed me to find a straw bidder to purchase a portrait of him that was being auctioned at an Art Hamptons Event. The objective was to ensure that his portrait, which was going to be auctioned last, would go for the highest price of any portrait that afternoon. The portrait was purchased by the fake bidder for $60,000. Mr. Trump directed the Trump Foundation, which is supposed to be a charitable organization, to repay the fake bidder, despite keeping the art for himself. Please see Exhibit 3B to my testimony. And it should come as no surprise that one of my more common responsibilities was that Mr. Trump directed me to call business owners, many of whom were small businesses, that were owed money for their services and told them no payment or a reduced payment would be coming. When I advised Mr. Trump of my success, he actually reveled in it. And yet, I continued to work for him. Mr. Trump is a conman. He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did. Lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets. She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly \u2013 and she did not deserve that. I am giving the Committee today a copy of the $130,000 wire transfer from me to Ms. Clifford\u2019s attorney during the closing days of the presidential campaign that was demanded by Ms. Clifford to maintain her silence about her affair with Mr. Trump. This is Exhibit 4 to my testimony. Mr. Trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a Home Equity Line of Credit to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign. I did that, too \u2013 without bothering to consider whether that was improper, much less whether it was the right thing to do or how it would impact me, my family, or the public. I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later. As Exhibit 5 to my testimony shows, I am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank account on August 1, 2017 \u2013 when he was President of the United States \u2013 pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me \u2013 the word used by Mr. Trump\u2019s TV lawyer -- for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf. This $35,000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year \u2013 while he was President. The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws. You can find the details of that scheme, directed by Mr. Trump, in the pleadings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. So picture this scene \u2013 in February 2017, one month into his presidency, I\u2019m visiting President Trump in the Oval Office for the first time. It\u2019s truly awe-inspiring, he\u2019s showing me around and pointing to different paintings, and he says to me something to the effect of\u2026Don\u2019t worry, Michael, your January and February reimbursement checks are coming. They were Fed-Exed from New York and it takes a while for that to get through the White House system. As he promised, I received the first check for the reimbursement of $70,000 not long thereafter. When I say conman, I\u2019m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores. As I mentioned, I\u2019m giving the Committee today copies of a letter I sent at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction threatening these schools with civil and criminal actions if Mr. Trump\u2019s grades or SAT scores were ever disclosed without his permission. These are Exhibit 6. The irony wasn\u2019t lost on me at the time that Mr. Trump in 2011 had strongly criticized President Obama for not releasing his grades. As you can see in Exhibit 7, Mr. Trump declared \u201cLet him show his records\u201d after calling President Obama \u201ca terrible student.\u201d The sad fact is that I never heard Mr. Trump say anything in private that led me to believe he loved our nation or wanted to make it better. In fact, he did the opposite. When telling me in 2008 that he was cutting employees\u2019 salaries in half \u2013 including mine \u2013 he showed me what he claimed was a $10 million IRS tax refund, and he said that he could not believe how stupid the government was for giving \u201csomeone like him\u201d that much money back. During the campaign, Mr. Trump said he did not consider Vietnam Veteran, and Prisoner of War, Senator John McCain to be \u201ca hero\u201d because he likes people who weren\u2019t captured. At the same time, Mr. Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft. Mr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment. He finished the conversation with the following comment. \u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid, I wasn\u2019t going to Vietnam.\u201d I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now. And yet, I continued to work for him. *** Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions. Sometime in the summer of 2017, I read all over the media that there had been a meeting in Trump Tower in June 2016 involving Don Jr. and others from the campaign with Russians, including a representative of the Russian government, and an email setting up the meeting with the subject line, \u201cDirt on Hillary Clinton.\u201d Something clicked in my mind. I remember being in the room with Mr. Trump, probably in early June 2016, when something peculiar happened. Don Jr. came into the room and walked behind his father\u2019s desk \u2013 which in itself was unusual. People didn\u2019t just walk behind Mr. Trump\u2019s desk to talk to him. I recalled Don Jr. leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying: \u201cThe meeting is all set.\u201d I remember Mr. Trump saying, \u201cOk good\u2026let me know.\u201d What struck me as I looked back and thought about that exchange between Don Jr. and his father was, first, that Mr. Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr. had the worst judgment of anyone in the world. And also, that Don Jr. would never set up any meeting of any significance alone \u2013 and certainly not without checking with his father. I also knew that nothing went on in Trump world, especially the campaign, without Mr. Trump\u2019s knowledge and approval. So, I concluded that Don Jr. was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representative when he walked behind his dad\u2019s desk that day -- and that Mr. Trump knew that was the meeting Don Jr. was talking about when he said, \u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026let me know.\u201d *** Over the past year or so, I have done some real soul searching. I see now that my ambition and the intoxication of Trump power had much to do with the bad decisions I made. To you, Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, the other members of this Committee, and the other members of the House and Senate, I am sorry for my lies and for lying to Congress. To our nation, I am sorry for actively working to hide from you the truth about Mr. Trump when you needed it most. For those who question my motives for being here today, I understand. I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your \u201cfixer,\u201d Mr. Trump. I am going to prison and have shattered the safety and security that I tried so hard to provide for my family. My testimony certainly does not diminish the pain I caused my family and friends \u2013 nothing can do that. And I have never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump. And, by coming today, I have caused my family to be the target of personal, scurrilous attacks by the President and his lawyer \u2013 trying to intimidate me from appearing before this panel. Mr. Trump called me a \u201crat\u201d for choosing to tell the truth \u2013 much like a mobster would do when one of his men decides to cooperate with the government. As Exhibit 8 shows, I have provided the Committee with copies of Tweets that Mr. Trump posted, attacking me and my family \u2013 only someone burying his head in the sand would not recognize them for what they are: encouragement to someone to do harm to me and my family. I never imagined that he would engage in vicious, false attacks on my family \u2013 and unleash his TV-lawyer to do the same. I hope this committee and all members of Congress on both sides of the aisle will make it clear: As a nation, we should not tolerate attempts to intimidate witnesses before congress and attacks on family are out of bounds and not acceptable. I wish to especially thank Speaker Pelosi for her statements in Exhibit 9 to protect this institution and me, and the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Adam Schiff and Chairman Cummings for likewise defending this institution and my family against the attacks by Mr. Trump, and also the many Republicans who have admonished the President as well. I am not a perfect man. I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life. But today, I get to decide the example I set for my children and how I attempt to change how history will remember me. I may not be able to change the past, but I can do right by the American people here today. Thank you for your attention. I am happy to answer the Committee\u2019s questions. More reading: Michael Cohen says President Trump was involved in a \u2018hush money\u2019 scheme. He brought checks to Congress to prove it. Michael Cohen hearing: Live updates","21":"LONDON \u2014 For a person who\u2019s determined to storm a Premier League field and confront \u2014 even assault \u2014 a player, there isn\u2019t much that stands in the way. Seating is packed close to the action, and players \u2014 especially when taking corners and throw-ins \u2014 are in touching distance of rival fans. With fences dismantled long ago at English stadiums, a sprint from the stands to the pitch can be achieved in seconds before a global television audience. There is a good chance police won\u2019t be there to impede the trespassing fan \u2014 only stewards. \u201cYou\u2019ve got generation of fans now who come about where it\u2019s quite unusual to see the police at a football match, which in some ways is a good thing because we\u2019d much rather not be there,\u201d said Mark Roberts, head of British football policing. \u201cBut I think that tends to breed anti-social behavior.\u201d Incidents across the weekend in England have reinforced the need for authorities to reassess security at matches, with the English Football Association saying a \u201cline has been crossed\u201d by unruly fans. At the Emirates Stadium in London on Sunday, a man invaded the pitch and pushed Manchester United defender Chris Smalling as he appeared to try to join in the Arsenal goal celebrations. Gary Cooper was charged Monday with common assault and entering the playing area. That incident came hours after Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish was punched by a Birmingham fan who invaded the field during a derby match in the second-tier League Championship. In swift justice, Paul Mitchell was jailed Monday for 14 weeks. \u201cI cannot help but feel how lucky I was in this incident,\u201d Grealish said in a statement read to the court in Birmingham. \u201cIt could have been so much worse had the supporter had some sort of weapon.\u201d That danger was all-too apparent in tennis in 1993 when Monica Seles was stabbed by a fan during a match in Hamburg, Germany. Grealish\u2019s alarm is set against the background of rising knife crime in Britain. In the 12 months since March 2018, there were 285 knife killings in England and Wales \u2014 the highest number since comparable records began in 1946. While sporting and criminal authorities are not issuing any specific warnings about knife crimes in sports venues, they were already making plans to enhance stadium safety before the weekend incidents. Jurisdiction over stadium security falls to local authorities who grant safety certificates based on risk assessments. \u201cMark and I would probably agree that we\u2019ve gone a bit too far with police-free matches,\u201d Premier League executive director Bill Bush said alongside Roberts in the competition\u2019s London headquarters last week. In Germany, the Bundesliga said there are police at every game. \u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s iconic, symbolically important about the police uniform in the ground,\u201d Bush said. \u201cHowever many stewards you deploy and however well you train them, that\u2019s never had the same effect, and they don\u2019t have arrest powers so which everyone knows.\u201d The number of sworn officers at stadiums has dropped since the violence that blighted English football in the 1970s and 1980s largely disappeared from new stands funded by the wealth of the Premier League, which launched in 1992. Stadiums were transformed into safer, all-seat venues, with fences around the playing surface torn down to avoid catastrophes like the 1989 human crush at Hillsborough Stadium that killed 96 people. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a shifting culture from being a fan in the \u201880s on occasions when football was pretty frightening and on a lot of occasions downright unpleasant,\u201d said Roberts, who leads on football issues for the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council. \u201cThere was recognition that this is a major issue and it got a response that was commensurate with it, which actually led to the success we had in making football a really good product for the Premier League and Football League where you could go safely. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be such a glossy worldwide product now if you still have regular racist chancing, pitch battles on the terraces.\u201d Increasing the number of police in stadiums is complicated by the pressure to finance public services in Britain. Since 2009, 22,424 police officers have been cut in England and Wales \u2014 playing a role in the rise in stewards used at stadiums. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a 45 percent increase in assaults on stewards and a commensurate decrease in the number of assaults on the police,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any police there and you\u2019re probably more likely to assault a steward because there\u2019s less of an immediate sanction in terms of arrest and dependent on CCTV (video).\u201d That could indicate why there was a 6 percent drop in football-related arrests in England and Wales in the 2017-18 season to 1,542. While encircling fields with police officers would send out a warning, the Premier League sees it as inefficient and knows they would be depriving the wider community of protection. A court ruling in 2018 said that second-tier club Ipswich was not responsible for paying for policing around the streets of its stadium \u2014 even next to the turnstiles. Clubs, particularly lower down the leagues, are even more reluctant to pay for policing inside stadiums, which raises the risk of disorder. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got as many resources,\u201d Roberts pointed out, \u201cso we are having to be really judicious about where we put them.\u201d Premier League clubs aren\u2019t short of cash for policing, with 211 million pounds ($280 million) spent alone in a year on agents facilitating transfers, according to the most recent figures. \u201cThere comes a point actually you need some police,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWe need to make sure that we\u2019ve got properly funded police in stadiums ... but we can\u2019t subsidize football to the detriment of the local community.\u201d Roberts is blunt when dismissing calls by the head of the Football League, which operates the three professional divisions below the Premier League, to consider ending the blanket ban on alcohol being consumed in stadium seating during games that has been in place since 1985. \u201cThat to me is frankly complete nonsense,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIf you start adding alcohol into people sat there during the course of the game, it just adds fuel to the fire really the issues we currently try to deal with.\u201d Unlike England, Scotland has a complete ban on fans drinking in stadiums, even in concourses away from the seating. It hasn\u2019t prevented a spate of recent violent incidents over the last week \u2014 with two coming at Hibernian. In a Scottish Premiership game on Friday night, Rangers captain James Tavernier found himself face to face with a Hibernian fan who jumped out of the home support stand. A glass bottle was thrown from the same section the previous weekend as Celtic winger Scott Sinclair prepared to take a corner kick. \u201cFor the image of the game, it\u2019s not right at all,\u201d said Rangers manager Steven Gerrard, a former captain of Liverpool and England. \u201cIf it continues someone is going to get hurt and hurt badly.\u201d The government had already called in football officials and police last month for a summit to discuss disorder at games. \u201cThe incidents that happened over the weekend were a disgrace,\u201d sports minister Mims Davies said. ___","22":"THE PROGNOSIS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\u00a0(J. Scott Applewhite\/AP) Obamacare plans remain too expensive for some Americans \u2014 particularly those who are older and earn moderate income.\u00a0But don\u2019t expect Congress to do much about it. For all the lip service lawmakers still pay to improving the Affordable Care Act, there\u2019s little path forward this year for any bipartisan legislation to improve the affordability of plans offered through a law that remains sharply divisive nearly a decade after Congress passed it. Moderate House Democrats trying to counter the Medicare-for-all push from liberals say they\u2019re focusing on ACA fixes as a pragmatic, bipartisan way forward. But so far they\u2019ve not advanced any such measures that have GOP buy-in, even as they prepare for another ACA-themed hearing tomorrow morning in the House Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s Health subcommittee. As for congressional Republicans, they\u2019re publicly admitting they\u2019ve pretty much moved on from Obamacare and any effort to improve, weaken\u00a0or otherwise change it. \u201cI think there\u2019s a little bit of once burned, why are we going at it again?\"\u00a0Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told reporters\u00a0Thursday. \u201cI think as a Republican legislator, I look for where can I get a result \u2014\u00a0where can I get something that Patty Murray and I and Frank\u00a0Pallone and Greg Walden all can agree on?\u201d Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said at an Atlantic event the day prior, referring to the leaders of the top health committees in the House and the Senate. \u201cWe\u2019ve proved over eight years that\u2019s hard to do on Obamacare so I\u2019d rather work on this other set of issues for the next couple of years,\u201d Alexander continued, pointing to broader efforts underway to rein in drug prices and increase transparency. Alexander, speaking at the Atlantic event: It\u2019s a striking admission from the senator, who poured energy into advancing a bipartisan measure he co-wrote in late 2017 with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to infuse more funding into the Obamacare marketplaces. The effort showed a rare GOP openness to improving the health-care law, but it all collapsed under fights over federal funding for abortion (as I detailed at the time). That same disagreement would almost certainly derail one of three bills Democrats are teeing up for consideration at tomorrow\u2019s hearing. The measure, sponsored by Reps. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) and Scott Peters (D-Calif.), would give states money to either set up \u201creinsurance\u201d programs to boost insurers with sicker patients or reduce out-of-pocket costs for poorer enrollees. Those are ideas Republicans have broadly supported in the past, but the Craig-Peters bill doesn\u2019t include longstanding federal restrictions on when federal funding may be used for abortions. In a memo sent to GOP committee members last night, committee staff noted that omission and added that the bill isn\u2019t paid for. The other two bills being considered by\u00a0the subcommittee would supply new funding for navigators \u2014 a not-so-subtle dig at the Trump administration for mostly canceling grants for groups that enroll people in marketplace plans. It\u00a0would also restore now-expired funds for states to run their own marketplaces instead of relying on Healthcare.gov. \u201cThese bills either miss the mark\u00a0or squander a real opportunity to advance solutions that have had bipartisan consensus,\u201d a Republican committee aide told Health 202. Rep. Mike Burgess (R-Tex.), the Health subcommittee's ranking member, said he's \"concerned that they do not adequately address the affordability of health insurance.\" Rep. Greg Walden (Ore.), ranking\u00a0Republican\u00a0on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. (Drew Angerer\/Getty Images) A spokesman for Energy and Commerce Democrats said the bills \u201cwere chosen because they\u2019re commonsense solutions to lower consumers\u2019 health care costs right away.\u201d \u2014It\u2019s like Democrats and Republicans are still residing on totally different planets when it comes to the ACA. Shortly after Alexander made his comments at the Atlantic event, top Energy and Commerce Democrat Frank Pallone (N.J.) mounted the stage and said he\u2019s focusing on ACA fixes precisely because he thinks they can move through a divided Congress. \u201cI\u2019m trying to focus in Energy and Commerce mostly on things we think we can get done in this two-year session,\u201d Pallone said. \u201cMost of our focus is stabilizing the Affordable Care Act because of all the sabotage by the Trump administration.\u201d But so far, Democrats have spent the bulk of their time lambasting Republicans over various ways they\u2019ve undermined protections for patients with preexisting conditions or pushed what Democrats term \u201cjunk\u201d insurance plans \u2014\u00a0topics that helped Democrats win the House majority last year. Over the past two months, Democratse have\u00a0held a half-dozen hearings framed along these lines. \u2014All the while, older, middle-class people are struggling to afford coverage, particularly in rural areas. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation study\u00a0released this morning, 60-year-olds with a $50,000 income must pay at least one-fifth of what they earn for the least expensive premiums for health plans in ACA marketplaces across a broad swath of the Midwest, my colleague Amy Goldstein reports. In much of the country, those premiums require at least one-sixth of such people\u2019s income. \"The new analysis documents county by county that even as average ACA premiums for the most popular level of coverage\u00a0dipped slightly\u00a0for this year \u2014 the first time that has happened since the marketplaces opened in 2014 \u2014 there is wide geographic variation in how affordable rates are,\" Amy writes. Two features of the ACA make middle-class and older adults\u00a0especially vulnerable to high insurance costs. There's a\u00a0\u201ccliff\u201d in which premium subsidies end at 400\u2009percent of the federal poverty line and a rule allowing ACA health plans to charge three times as much to older adults as younger ones. \"The combined effects of these rules are especially stark in rural areas, where health plans tend to be more expensive,\" Amy explains. \"The analysis shows that in almost all of Nebraska, a 60-year-old with a $50,000 income would pay between 30 percent and 50 percent of that income in premiums for the least expensive ACA health plan.\" The Trump administration says it's trying to improve affordability by expanding access to certain types of leaner, cheaper plans, but Democrats have characterized those\u00a0plans as \"junk\" insurance and there's been little evidence on Capitol Hill of bipartisanship on the issue of health-care costs. The Eli Lilly corporate headquarters in Indianapolis. (Darron Cummings\/AP) AHH: Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly announced it will start selling a generic version of its popular insulin product, Humalog, at 50 percent of the current price. The company said it would offer a so-called authorized generic of the product, Humalog 100, for $137.35 per vial, which is half the current\u00a0list price, the New York Times\u2019s Katie Thomas reports. This new product will be called Insulin Lispro. Such an \u201cauthorized generic\u201d means that, besides the label, \u201cit is identical to the brand-name drug and manufactured in the same facilities,\u201d Katie writes. The change comes amid escalating criticism over the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs,\u00a0and as lawmakers have focused some of the criticism on rising insulin costs specifically. \u201cThe move offers a compromise to critics who have called on drugmakers to lower their list prices,\u201d Katie writes. \u201cLilly will continue selling Humalog at its regular price to the insurers and employers who want to keep pocketing the large discounts, or rebates, they receive for purchasing brand-name drugs, while also making available a cheaper version to patients who pay for their insulin out of pocket.\u201d The move also comes\u00a0after the Senate Finance Committee sent a letter to the top insulin manufacturer asking for information about how it sets prices for its products. \"While this change is a step in the right direction, all of us in the health care community must do more to fix the problem of high out-of-pocket costs for Americans living with chronic conditions,\" the company\u2019s chief executive,\u00a0David A. Ricks, said in a statement. \"We hope our announcement is a catalyst for positive change across the U.S. health care system.\" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra.\u00a0(Rich Pedroncelli\/AP) OOF: A group of 20 states and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) separately announced lawsuits to stop the Trump administration\u2019s rule that\u00a0could shift tens of millions of dollars away from organizations such as Planned Parenthood and toward faith-based and antiabortion clinics. The lawsuits seek a court injunction to halt the implementation of the rule in 60 days, our Post colleague Ariana Eunjung Cha reports, and they\u2019re the first in an expected wave of legal challenges to the administration\u2019s changes to the Title X family-planning program. The administration\u2019s rule means federally funded family planning clinics can no longer refer patients for abortions and have to maintain a \u201cclear physical and financial separation\u201d between abortion services and services funded by the government. Becerra\u2019s suit was filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, while the multistate suit from the group of mostly\u00a0Democratic-controlled states\u00a0is expected to be filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Ore., Ariana reports. Becerra said the rule would deny \u201cpatients access to critical health care services and prevents doctors from providing comprehensive and accurate information about medical care.\u201d In a statement, officials from Oregon, one of the states in the other suit, said the changes \u201cwould require health clinics to open another location, or create a separate entrance for patients, have separate examination rooms, hire separate personnel to work at separate workstations, maintain a separate phone number and website, and have separate electronic medical systems in order to continue to accept Title X funds.\u201d \u201cThe 21 states are just some of the parties \u2014 including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights \u2014 that have vowed to sue over the rule, which was published Monday in the Federal Register,\u201d Ariana reports. OUCH: A top official in Washington state, which is dealing with the worst measles outbreak in two decades, wants the federal government\u2019s help in tackling the anti-vaccination\u00a0movement, our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports. Washington state\u2019s health secretary John Wiesman is calling for a national campaign, similar to the government\u2019s efforts to stop\u00a0smoking, to combat the false information coming from parents and others regarding immunizations to prevent a variety of childhood diseases. At least 75 people have been sickened by the measles outbreak in the Pacific Northwest, and most of those are unvaccinated children under age 10. The region is home to some of the most vocal and organized anti-vaccination activists, Lena writes. Wiesman, who will\u00a0testify\u00a0today before the Senate HELP\u00a0Committee, lamented a lack of strategy. He wants the federal government to provide funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to launch a campaign to examine why people are worried about vaccine safety and come up with a public health response, Lena reports. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to counter the media of a very well-organized and connected group of a small number of folks who are having a huge impact\u201d in spreading misinformation about vaccines, he told The Post. \u201cWe\u2019re really lacking that.\u201d Family and friends who have lost loved ones to OxyContin and opioid overdoses protest outside Purdue Pharma headquarters in Stamford, Conn. (Jessica Hill\/AP) \u2014\u00a0OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma filed a motion to try to\u00a0throw out a lawsuit from\u00a0Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. In the motion, Purdue says the suit amounts to \u201coversimplified scapegoating,\u201d which creates a \u201csensationalist and distorted narrative that ignores facts,\" our Post colleague Katie Zezima reports. Healey\u2019s suit alleges Purdue disregarded addiction risks, misleading patients and doctors as they prescribed and took high doses of the opioid, even as opioid-related overdoses spiked. \u201cPurdue alleges that some claims made by Healey are contradicted by the Massachusetts Department of Health and the FDA, which approved the medication and its labeling,\u201d Katie adds. \u201cPurdue argues that Healey is putting forward a \u2018misleading narrative\u2019 about OxyContin.\u201d Healey\u2019s office is planning to oppose the motion. \u2014 Meanwhile, the company is reportedly considering filing for bankruptcy amid potential liabilities in\u00a0more than 1,600 lawsuits against the manufacturer,\u00a0alleging it contributed to the opioid crisis.\u00a0 If the company filed for bankruptcy protection, the move would halt the lawsuits so Purdue Pharma could negotiate legal claims with plaintiffs under the direction of a bankruptcy judge, Reuters\u2019s Mike Spector, Jessica DiNapoli and Nate Raymond report. \u201cThe potential move shows how Purdue and its wealthy owners, the Sackler family, are under pressure to respond to mounting litigation accusing the drugmaker of misleading doctors and patients about risks associated with prolonged use of its prescription opioids,\u201d they write. The company hasn\u2019t made a final decision about the bankruptcy filing, per the report. \u201cAs a privately-held company, it has been Purdue Pharma\u2019s longstanding policy not to comment on our financial or legal strategy,\u201d the company told Reuters in a statement. \u201cWe are, however, committed to ensuring that our business remains strong and sustainable. We have ample liquidity and remain committed to meeting our obligations to the patients who benefit from our medicines, our suppliers and other business partners.\u201d (iStock) \u2014 A new analysis from Kaiser Health News found the pharmaceutical industry gave money to various patient advocacy groups that have expressed opposition to a Trump administration proposal to change what drugs are covered by Medicare Part D\u2019s \u201cprotected\u201d classes. Of the dozens of patient advocacy groups that have recently been part of national advertising campaigns pushing back against the Trump administration's proposed Medicare changes, about half of the groups received money from drugmakers.\u00a0 More than $58 million went to the groups in 2015, Kaiser Health News\u2019s Sydney Lupkin, Elizabeth Lucas and Victoria Knight report, citing data from financial disclosures in its \u201cPre$cription for Power\u201d database. \u201cAs patient organizations gain ground lobbying Congress and the administration, experts have begun to question whether their financial ties could push them to put drugmakers\u2019 interests ahead of the patients they represent,\u201d they write. Matthew McCoy, a University of Pennsylvania medical ethics and health policy assistant professor, told the Kaiser reporters\u00a0that\u00a0even though\u00a0there are circumstances in which \u201cwhat\u2019s best for patients is the same as what\u2019s best for drugmakers, people should consider patient advocacy group statements with a \u2018skeptical eye\u2019 if groups have financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry.\" Researchers hope that shutting down the a specific gene could offer a way to cure HIV in adults. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) \u2014 A decade after the first person was cured of HIV, a London man could be the second. He has been in remission from the disease for a year and a half, without drug treatment, after receiving a stem cell transplant of virus-resistant cells. It\u2019s still \u201cpremature\u201d to be declared a cure, according to the report of the patient\u2019s case in the journal Nature, our Post colleague Carolyn Y. Johnson reports. Timothy Brown, known as the \"Berlin patient,\" was cured a decade ago after he received a similar stem cell transplant. \u201cThe London patient, infected with HIV and suffering from Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, received bone marrow cells from a donor who had a malfunctioning CCR5 gene as part of his cancer treatment,\u201d Carolyn writes. \u201cThe gene is known to create a protein that is crucial for HIV to invade blood cells. Brown had also received a transplant without functioning CCR5 genes.\u201d She adds researchers have failed for a decade to reproduce the results of the Berlin case, in part because these transplants are rare and only performed when there\u2019s a clinical reason, like cancer, to do them. It\u2019s also rare to find the needed donors who are genetic matches and carry two copies of the disabled CCR5 gene. \u201cThese new findings reaffirm our belief that there exists a proof of concept that HIV is curable,\u201d International AIDS Society president Anton Pozniak said in a statement. \u201cThe hope is that this will eventually lead to a safe, cost-effective and easy strategy to achieve these results using gene technology or antibody techniques.\u201d Today","23":"If the old Watergate expression is \u201cIt\u2019s not the crime; it\u2019s the coverup,\u201d then today\u2019s equivalent might be \u201cIt\u2019s not the crime; it\u2019s the crime\u2019s offspring.\u201d Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York served a sweeping subpoena on President Trump\u2019s inaugural committee on Monday. Nothing could more clearly illustrate the breadth of the president\u2019s legal exposure and the limits of his nearly two-year strategy to attack and undermine special counsel Robert S. Mueller III \u2014 because the special counsel\u2019s work is merely the sturdy root of a veritable Mueller family tree. What began as an FBI counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election has sprouted into multiple investigations in multiple jurisdictions examining multiple possible crimes. The case against the president\u2019s personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen is the direct line, the first child. The investigation of the inaugural committee, which sprang from the Cohen case, is the grandchild. And on it goes. The president no longer faces jeopardy from just one federal criminal probe, but at least three, and not just one prosecutor\u2019s office, but the full resources of the entire Justice Department. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Trump asserted that \u201cridiculous partisan investigations\u201d threatened the \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d that was happening on his watch. The threat of the investigations, however you characterize them, is to the president himself. Prosecutors looking into illegality in one area of the president\u2019s life have discovered evidence of potential crimes in other areas. Mueller\u2019s discovery of wrongdoing by Cohen led to a referral to prosecutors in Manhattan, who secured a guilty plea from Cohen for violating campaign finance laws and alleged in court papers that it was Trump who directed Cohen to break the law. That investigation in turn produced evidence of wrongdoing at the Trump inaugural committee, which has led to an investigation of a Trump donor, a Los Angeles venture capitalist with ties to Qatar. To open a new investigation, prosecutors need a credible predicate to believe that a crime has been committed. They must develop probable cause to believe they will uncover evidence or the fruit of a crime to persuade a federal judge to issue a search warrant. None of this suggests the witch hunt Trump often claims it is. Federal investigations are serious business, with high stakes for those involved. Public corruption cases undergo internal scrutiny at the Justice Department to avoid the possibility of political maneuvering. An individual who becomes a target in one wants to limit the possible crimes he faces to as narrow a range as possible. That is doubly true for a political officeholder, who must manage the political fallout of investigations as well as the prospect of being charged in court. Trump, however, is now fighting a legal battle on multiple fronts, both substantively and geographically. He is in jeopardy. Criminal charges once he leaves office or referrals to the House of Representatives for an impeachment inquiry before then are real possibilities. Compounding all this is the fact that related investigations cross-pollinate. Evidence and cooperating witnesses produced in one case can help prosecutors in another, increasing the risk that wrongdoing, if it exists, will be uncovered. For example, once he pleaded guilty and became a cooperator, the president\u2019s former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates served as a witness against Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort at his trial. But as both a former campaign and inaugural staffer, Gates also has information that is useful in the other probes. Mueller recently told a judge in Washington that Gates continues to cooperate in \u201cseveral ongoing investigations.\u201d Similarly, Cohen first agreed to plead guilty in the Southern District\u2019s campaign finance probe, but then he became a cooperator for Mueller and provided, in the course of seven interviews, what the special counsel called \u201cuseful information\u2019\u2019 concerning certain discrete Russia-related matters core to its investigation. The same is true for Michael Flynn, who has cooperated in at least two separate investigations after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about his contacts with former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The pool of knowledge developed through crossover investigations amplifies prosecutors\u2019 ability to uncover evidence and increases the likelihood they will have sufficient proof to bring charges. Each new rock the Justice Department turns over holds the potential to launch entirely new lines of inquiry. In addition to the three investigations into the president and the organizations he has headed, Mueller has already referred multiple cases that we know of to prosecutors in Manhattan and Washington. The U.S. attorney in D.C. has secured guilty pleas from a former Senate staffer (for lying to investigators) and a Republican lobbyist (who arranged for foreigners to contribute to the president\u2019s inauguration using straw donors), while SDNY continues to investigate whether prominent lawyers and lobbyists working with Manafort on behalf of Ukraine violated laws on foreign registration. Furthermore, the New York state attorney general is investigating the Trump Foundation, extending the president\u2019s exposure beyond the Justice Department. If Mueller is indeed winding down in the near future, as acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker recently claimed he was, it could only be with referrals to U.S. attorneys\u2019 offices around the country. The reality is that in prosecutions, it\u2019s never over until it\u2019s over. New evidence can come to light at a late stage and trigger new investigations. Mueller\u2019s reported interest in interactions between the representatives of the government of the United Arab Emirates and the Trump transition team seems ripe for such a referral. There are also concerns over potential financial improprieties in the development of Trump Tower Moscow. And this doesn\u2019t even account for any unknown areas Mueller may be pursuing. It\u2019s this threat of multiple ongoing investigations spanning the foreseeable future that should frighten the president the most. Whatever his personal criminal liability, it\u2019s now proven that the organizations he has run \u2014 business, political and governmental \u2014 have been populated with actual criminals. Six of his associates, including his longtime friend and political adviser, his lawyer, his campaign chairman, his deputy campaign chairman and a foreign policy adviser have been indicted or pleaded guilty. It would be naive at this point to believe that more such charges are not coming. That apple could fall very near the tree indeed.","24":"THE PROGNOSIS Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar plans to tout his efforts to lower drug prices, roll back Obamacare regulations and reduce opioid abuse in a wide-ranging address Friday morning marking his one-year anniversary as head of one of the largest and most influential federal agencies. Before Azar\u2019s speech, which is scheduled for 10 a.m. at the Hubert H. Humphrey Building, the agency will release a 55-page \u201c2018 Annual Report,\u201d shared first with The Health 202. The report lists dozens of steps taken by HHS and its sub-agencies in the past year \u2014 from the widely praised to the more\u00a0controversial \u2014 which Azar says are furthering his top goals of reducing drug prices, making insurance more affordable, changing how care is paid for and halting the opioid abuse epidemic. \u201cWe have lofty goals,\u201d Azar writes in the report. \u201cWinning these battles will require not just innovative use of the powers and resources of government, but also enlisting all other stakeholders, whose buy-in will be necessary to create sustained and significant improvements for the people we serve.\u201d It\u2019s been nearly 13 months since Azar was confirmed as the Trump administration\u2019s second Health and Human Services secretary, after his predecessor Tom Price resigned following misuse of government funds. In that time, the former Eli Lilly executive has taken surprisingly aggressive action against the\u00a0pharmaceutical industry, even as he\u2019s pursued a more predictable route\u00a0for a GOP appointee in trying to roll back\u00a0Affordable Care Act rules and advance\u00a0restrictions on abortion. President Trump has made lowering drug prices one of his favorite\u00a0talking points, and his administration released a blueprint to achieve that goal last May. He has tweeted at pharmaceutical exceutives, who will be on Capitol Hill next week to defend their steep price hikes. So far, there has been limited success in curbing price increases, causing Trump to last month summon policymakers, including Azar, to the White House to discuss the subject. In today's speech, which is expected to last about 25 minutes, Azar will stress the multiple steps his department has taken to tackle the drug price problem. The secretary is\u00a0expected to point to a promised initiative to link certain Medicare drug prices to lower prices found in other countries and an earlier proposal requiring drugmakers to display list prices in television ads. HHS proposed the rule on television ads last fall, but has yet to formally propose a regulation on the new drug pricing index. Azar is also expected to discuss Trump's recently announced\u00a0goal\u00a0of dramatically reducing HIV transmissions and may also tout a major, ongoing project at the National Institutes of Health to create a one-million-person pool of genetic information for advancing precision medicine research. In the report, the secretary also stresses a need to \u201ccontinue developing biomedical research enterprise, improve the quality of care offered in tribal health facilities, promote work and independence in our human services programs, fight key public health battles such as the rising wave of youth e-cigarette use, and so much more.\u201d The sheer range of goals listed in that paragraph are emblematic of the varied response Azar has prompted in the projects he\u2019s prioritized as secretary. On one hand, Azar and top officials have won some applause from Democrats for moves to address some widely shared concerns, like cracking down on e-cigarettes and boosting the number of generic drug approvals. But the agency has also advanced a number of measures that raise\u00a0the ire of Democrats and liberals, perhaps most notably by allowing states to institute Medicaid work requirements and expanding insurance plans\u00a0exempt from some ACA requirements. HHS has also made it easier for employers to refuse to cover birth control for their employees and is poised to release a new regulation banning abortion providers from receiving federal family planning dollars. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar is scheduled to deliver an agency address Friday morning.\u00a0(Alex Wong\/Getty Images) The new report touts those efforts and a wide variety of other steps taken by the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other departments within the sprawling agency, which oversees prescription drugs and devices, protects public health and administers the government\u2019s big health insurance programs. In a section about the opioid crisis, the agency points to new NIH-funded research into prevention and treatment of addiction and increased flexibility for several states in how they may use Medicaid funding to treat patients with substance abuse. It also stresses an increased emphasis on medication-assisted treatment and steps to make the overdose-reversing drug naloxone more widely available. In other parts of the report, Azar\u00a0points to efforts to reduce Medicare fraud, approve more generic drugs, implement a biodefense strategy and respond to last year\u2019s hurricanes and wildfires. A lengthy appendix entitled \u201cHHS By the Numbers\u201d claims credit for saving $26 billion on prescription drugs due to generic drug approvals and $12.5 billion in \u201ceconomic burden\u201d by reducing regulations. The report also claims credit for this year\u2019s expanded insurance options in the ACA marketplaces and premiums that, on average, decreased for the first time. \u201cThere are 23 more issuers for 2019 than 2018 and only five states will have one issuer, compared to ten states in 2018,\u201d it says. \u201cThis was the result of actions taken in 2017 and 2018 by the administration to stabilize the Affordable Care Act, including four new reinsurance waivers, all leading to lower premiums, rang\u00ading from 9 percent in Maine to 30 percent in Maryland.\u201d Many forces are at play in why the marketplace situation improved this year, making it less clear how much can\u00a0be directly\u00a0attributed to the two-year-old administration. Critics have also charged HHS with taking actions that could result in higher premiums, such as advancing short-term and association health plans that will likely lure some healthy enrollees away from the marketplaces. AHH: Two different measures aiming to repeal Idaho\u2019s voter-approved Medicaid expansion failed in a state House committee.  The House Health and Welfare Committee killed one proposed measure to\u00a0outright repeal expansion and a second bill seeking\u00a0to repeal expansion years down the road if the effort didn\u2019t result in expected savings, the Associated Press\u2019s Keith Ridler reports. \u201cThe majority of the committee rejected arguments made by Republican Reps. Julianne Young and John Green that Idaho voters were uninformed when they passed the initiative in November with 61 percent,\u201d Keith reports, adding several state lawmakers also said they couldn\u2019t dismiss the large majority of voters who approved the initiative. The votes were a win for Medicaid expansion in Idaho coming\u00a0less than two weeks after the Utah legislature passed a Medicaid plan that will cover tens of thousands fewer people than the expansion effort\u00a0voters approved at the ballot box\u00a0in November. OOF: Senate Finance Committee\u00a0ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and House Energy and Commerce Chair\u00a0Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) have sent a letter to Azar calling on the Trump administration to halt Medicaid work requirement approvals they warn \u201cundermine access to health care.\u201d The letter references the coverage losses in Arkansas, which has dropped 18,000 people from its Medicaid rolls for failing to comply with work rules. \u201cThe impact of the harmful policies included in Arkansas\u2019 waiver has been so alarming that even the independent, nonpartisan Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission wrote to you stating they were \u2018highly concerned\u2019 about the number of individuals losing coverage\u2026 and going as far as to say that forcing people off of coverage as a result of such policies should be halted,\u201d they wrote. \u00a0 OUCH: Purdue Pharma executive Richard Sackler said he agreed with a plan to conceal from doctors the strength of the potent opioid OxyContin, according to emails that were contained in\u00a0a sealed court deposition.  In May 1997, ten years before Purdue would plead guilty to minimizing the addictive quality of OxyContin, the company\u2019s head of sales and marketing, Michael Friedman, sent an email to Sackler explaining he didn\u2019t want to correct an incorrect impression that Oxycontin was weaker than morphine, reports ProPublica\u2019s David Armstrong in this latest story co-published with Stat News. \u201cIt would be extremely dangerous at this early stage in the life of the product,\u201d Friedman reportedly wrote, \u201cto make physicians think the drug is stronger or equal to morphine\u2026We are well aware of the view held by many physicians that oxycodone [the active ingredient in OxyContin] is weaker than morphine. I do not plan to do anything about that.\u201d \u201cI agree with you,\u201d Sackler responded. \u201cIs there a general agreement, or are there some holdouts?\u201d Sackler\u2019s support of the plan was not previously made public, but ProPublica obtained a sealed court document of a 2015 deposition given by\u00a0Sackler\u00a0part of a Kentucky lawsuit\u00a0against Purdue. In a statement, the company criticized the \u201cintentional leak of the deposition\" but also acknowledged it made a \u201cdetermination to avoid emphasizing OxyContin as a powerful cancer pain drug,\u201d because of \u201ca concern that non-cancer patients would be reluctant to take a cancer drug,\" David writes.\u00a0 \u2014 Recently disclosed court documents reveal just how much Sackler, who Stat\u2019s Andrew Joseph writes is \u201cone of the most elusive yet notorious figures in medicine,\u201d was involved in promoting OxyContin after the painkiller\u2019s launch in 1996.  \u201cYou won\u2019t believe how committed I am to make OxyContin a huge success,\u201d Sackler wrote in a 1999 email referenced in one such court document, Andrew writes. \u201cIt is almost that I dedicated my life to it. After the initial launch phase, I will have to catch up with my private life again.\u201d In the deposition reported by Stat and ProPublica, Sackler chalks up his actions to just part of doing\u00a0business. \u201cHe claims he was motivated by an interest in making the best possible medications for patients in pain,\u201d Andrew writes. \u201cHe also dismisses as simply misunderstood or innocuous any evidence that might be perceived as damaging. The sales tactics deployed by Purdue, which included rewarding top representatives with trips to Bermuda or London, were just what drug companies did, Sackler told a questioner.\u201d \u2014 Catalyst Pharmaceuticals is defending its high price tag for a medication that treats a rare autoimmune disorder after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sent a letter calling on the company to justify the cost. Catalyst says the $375,000 price for Firdapse, used to treat Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), is comparable to similar products, Reuters\u2019s Manas Mishra reports. \u201cThe company said that Firdapse\u2019s price was similar to other medicines that provide a significant clinical benefit in treating ultra-rare diseases, adding it believed the drug would be widely reimbursed by insurers for the small population it treats,\u201d Manas writes. In a statement to Reuters, Sanders said Catalyst was showing a \u201cblatant disregard for patients with LEMS,\u201d adding he will \u201cask FDA Commissioner [Scott]\u00a0Gottlieb to act immediately to help patients who are suffering.\u201d \u2014 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is launching a seven-figure ad campaign to push back against the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to peg what Medicare pays for drugs to what foreign countries pay. The Chamber is blasting the proposal as \u201cforeign price controls,\u201d The Hill\u2019s Jessie Hellmann reports and will launch cable, digital and print ads through early to mid-March to call on the Trump administration to ditch the plan and for lawmakers to oppose it. \u2014 Google has launched a new tool to try to combat the nation\u2019s ongoing opioid crisis by helping people locate where they can throw away unwanted medications.

Finance Minister Olaf Scholz\u2019s budget plan, which is to be presented to cabinet on Wednesday, foresees Germany\u2019s defense spending rising to 1.37 percent of national income in 2020, but decline to 1.25 by 2023, according to the dpa news agency, which reviewed a copy of the proposal. NATO countries have pledged to move toward spending 2 percent of GDP on defense and Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government had pledged to increase spending to 1.5 percent by 2024. U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell told The Associated Press Monday the government\u2019s consideration of \u201creducing its already unacceptable commitments to military readiness is a worrisome signal to Germany\u2019s 28 NATO allies.\u201d","26":"NICOSIA, Cyprus \u2014 Cyprus\u2019 finance minister said Friday he\u2019ll leave the post he\u2019s held since 2013 by the end of the year, insisting that the findings of an inquiry that partly blamed him for the demise of one of the country\u2019s banks had no bearing on his decision. Georgiades said it was time for him to move on after nearly seven years at the post and defended himself against the inquiry\u2019s findings which he called both \u201cmistaken and unfair.\u201d He said he still has the full backing of Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades amid opposition party calls for his dismissal and that under his stewardship, the Cypriot economy has rebounded strongly. Anastasiades said the inquiry had no real grounds to apportion blame to Georgiades for billions in bad loans that accumulated at the Co-operative Bank over the decades before his government came to power. Georgiades, 46, was appointed to steer the Cypriot economy in the immediate aftermath of a multibillion-euro rescue deal that Cyprus was forced to accept after a banking crisis nearly bankrupted the country. The inquiry faulted senior executives for bad judgment, inaction and ineptitude in dealing with the Co-op\u2019s bad loan portfolio and pointed to Georgiades\u2019 \u201dheavy burden of responsibility\u201d for not firing executives and for the bank\u2019s \u201cmistaken course\u201d in efforts to have it return to private hands. The government became the Co-operative bank\u2019s majority stakeholder with a 1.5 billion-euro ($1.7 billion) bailout as part of the 2013 rescue deal. Georgiades said selling off a bank that was once venerated for helping generations of Cypriots build homes and set up businesses ultimately became \u201cobligatory\u201d because of its bad loan burden.","27":"House Democrats, on Thursday, are introducing their top legislative priority, a set of \u201cdemocracy reforms\u201d intended to expand voting rights, clean up campaign finance and tighten government ethics. Senate Republicans are firmly opposed. And that means this bill, known as H.R. 1, is unlikely to be signed into law by this Congress. But even if Democrats recapture the Senate and the White House in 2020 and turn their proposals into law, a Republican-dominated Supreme Court would probably upend Democrats\u2019 plans. Here\u2019s why. 1. The Roberts court has already sunk the 1965 Voting Rights Act Called the For the People Act\u201d H.R. 1 seeks to restore and strengthen the 1965 Voting Rights Act. In particular, Democrats want to reimpose a process known as \u201cpreclearance\u201d: the requirement that jurisdictions with a documented history of racially discriminatory voting rules must get federal approval before making any changes to their election laws. Democrats aim to prevent states from adopting rules that might sound neutral but disproportionately harm the voting rights of racial minorities. But the Supreme Court has already weighed against \u201cpreclearance,\u201d holding in Shelby County v. Holder (2013) that the federal government may not insult the \u201cdignity\u201d of state governments by vetoing their election laws. 2. The court seems unlikely to allow a congressional ban on partisan gerrymandering  H.R. 1 transfers state legislatures\u2019 authority to draw congressional districts to independent redistricting commissions. Some states have already created such commissions \u2014 most recently Colorado, Michigan, Missouri and Utah. But in much of the country, state legislatures still hold this power. And they often use that power in partisan ways. In Wisconsin, for example, the Republican-controlled legislature drew congressional districts so effectively in 2011 that they have continued to win a majority of seats even when Democrats win the statewide vote. That\u2019s what happened in 2018, when Democrats won more than 50 percent of the vote \u2014 but took only three out of the state\u2019s eight congressional seats. Removing partisanship from redistricting has broad public support. But the court could stand in the way. Just four years ago, the Supreme Court upheld an Arizona voter initiative that sought to end partisan gerrymandering by transferring redistricting authority from the state legislature to a nonpartisan commission. However, the court\u2019s vote was 5 to 4, and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy \u2014 who retired from the bench last year \u2014 voted with the majority. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. dissented, relying on a strict literal reading of the Constitution to hold that a state\u2019s voters could not take away district line-drawing authority from the state legislature. Granted, a ballot initiative \u2014 not an act of Congress \u2014 took away redistricting authority from the Arizona state legislature. And the constitutional provision on which Roberts relied (the elections clause of Article 1, Section 4) expressly authorizes Congress to override state laws regarding congressional elections. But Roberts noted that while Congress may alter election regulations prescribed by the state legislature, it may not authorize an entity other than the state legislature to write such regulations. Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Clarence Thomas joined Roberts\u2019s dissent. That position seems likely to appeal to Trump-appointed Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh as well. If so, the court has a majority to strike down gerrymandering reform. 3. The Court has probably moved rightward on campaign finance regulation In Citizens United v. FEC (2010), the Court held that corporations have a First Amendment right to spend money on elections. However, it noted that Congress remained free to mandate that the sources of that funding must be publicly disclosed. H.R. 1 takes up that offer, adding new disclosure requirements for large donors. But the court\u2019s position may have shifted. That\u2019s because Kennedy wrote the court\u2019s opinion in Citizens United. Thomas specifically dissented from the holding about disclosure requirements. Thomas argued that corporations have a constitutional right to spend as much money as they want on campaign ads, without disclosing the source of the spending. Alito did not join Thomas\u2019s dissent, but he made a virtually identical argument in another case decided just a few months later. Sen. Mitch McConnell echoed this argument in The Washington Post in January. If Gorsuch and Kavanaugh agree, H.R. 1\u2019s disclosure requirements would need Roberts\u2019s vote to survive. 4. Nor is the court a fan of public campaign financing H.R. 1\u2019s provisions regarding small-donor matching funds seem even more vulnerable. The bill proposes that all donations up to $200 to a House candidate or presidential campaign would receive a 6-to-1 matching grant from the federal government. But in 2011, the court invalidated the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act by a 5-to-4 vote, with Roberts writing the majority opinion. Enacted by Arizona voters in 1998, the law set up voluntary public campaign funding for candidates for state office. Candidates who reached a specified number of small-dollar contributions from Arizona voters could receive state funding \u2014 so long as they agreed to strict limits on further private fundraising. The system was voluntary, and it included catch-up funds to level the playing field if one candidate for an office accepted public funding while another candidate did not. Roberts held that wealthy candidates have a First Amendment right to spend as much of their own money on their campaigns as they like, and that the government may not discourage such spending by granting additional funds to their opponents. Justice Elena Kagan took apart this conservative reading of the First Amendment in dissent, but Roberts had the votes \u2014 as he probably would next time around. 5. Democrats might have to play constitutional hardball When one party captures firm control of the courts, it often relies on those courts to advance its own interests. Congressional Republicans think H.R. 1 would harm their electoral prospects. Odds are that their judicial allies would agree. What, then, could reform advocates do? If the court strikes down key parts of the law, reformers could either change the court or change the Constitution. The first option is for Democrats to pack the court to bring it back into partisan balance. The second is to put their democracy-reform policies into the Constitution itself. Opponents of Citizens United have been calling for a constitutional amendment to allow Congress to regulate election spending. If Democrats want universal adult voter registration, nonpartisan electoral districting and mandatory disclosure of election-related spending, they would probably have to embed those requirements in the Constitution as well.

Court spokesman Mario Siekavizza said Wednesday that the court did not find sufficient evidence to intervene. Prosecutors announced Feb. 6 that their investigation together with the United Nations-sponsored anti-corruption commission had found that while Torres was head of the National Unity of Hope party, companies funneled contributions of $2.5 million that were not reported to electoral authorities. Prosecutors are investigating Torres for the possible crimes of illicit association, perjury, illicit and unreported electoral financing and tax fraud. Torres previously ran unsuccessfully for president in 2015. She has called the probe a political attack.","29":"Two Republican senators said Thursday they would decline to spend political contributions from billionaire financier John Childs and would instead direct the money to charity, now that Childs has been charged with soliciting prostitution in Florida. The decision could pressure other GOP candidates and groups who have benefited from Childs\u2019 largesse in recent years, including some who have urged Democrats to return their own money from donors accused of sexual misconduct. Childs, 77, has donated about $17 million since 2007 to support conservative politicians and causes, federal records show. For decades, he has ranked as one of the most generous GOP donors in the country, giving six-figure sums to the national party, the Senate and House campaign operations, and super PACs working to elect Republicans. He was one of 165 people charged on Feb. 21 with solicitation of prostitution as part of a six-month sex trafficking investigation of massage parlors in Florida. A clerk at the Indian River County Court said Thursday Childs had not yet answered the warrant. Childs could not be located for comment, but he has previously denied the allegations. \u201cThe accusation of solicitation of prostitution is totally false. I have retained a lawyer,\u201d Childs told Bloomberg News in a Feb. 22 interview. His eponymous private equity firm, J.W. Childs Associates, announced his retirement three days later. The firm said Childs had not been actively involved with the firm on a day-to-day basis \u201cfor some time.\u201d Political operatives from both parties are increasingly highlighting donations their rivals have received from individuals facing ethical questions or criminal charges. The charges against Childs have raised particular questions because he has been such a large donor. Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), who has made combating sex trafficking a top focus, on Thursday made a donation of $8,100 \u2014 the same amount she\u2019d received from Childs \u2014 to a veterans\u2019 charity, Freedom Alliance, after her office was contacted by The Washington Post. She had previously transferred to charity contributions from former Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), who asked two female employees to bear his child as a surrogate. A McSally spokeswoman, Katie Waldman, said she also returned money from casino magnate Steve Wynn, a former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct and coercion by multiple women. Wynn has denied wrongdoing. Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) also announced he would be donating the $5,400 he received from Childs. \u201cSenator Braun is in the process of returning this donation to the Julian Center in Indianapolis, which empowers survivors of domestic and sexual violence,\u201d spokesman Jahan Wilcox said in a statement to The Post. Most candidates and political groups lack clear policies on whether and when to return political donations from people accused or convicted of wrongdoing, even as political attacks for keeping such donations have become more common and sensitivity to mistreatment of women and others has grown. The issue is not limited to one party. Republicans have sought to draw attention to those who have received political donations from groups associated with Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D), who is embroiled in a crisis after disclosures that he wore blackface, for example. For their part, Democrats hope to put Republicans on the defensive with the Childs matter. The Florida Democratic Party has called on the state\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, another recipient of Childs\u2019s donations, to redirect the money. The Democratic National Committee on Thursday called on the Republican National Committee to return its donations from both Wynn and Childs. The DNC, however, has only partially redirected donations from longtime donor and Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein after his sex scandal broke. \u201cThe RNC refuses to return donations from former RNC Finance Chair Steve Wynn, and now they refuse to return donations from Republican donor John Childs even after a federal indictment that he solicited prostitution as part of a human trafficking ring,\u201d said spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa, in a statement to The Post. \u201cThis is disgusting and unacceptable, and does not reflect the values of voters across the country.\u201d A spokesman for the RNC, which has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Childs, including about $175,000 in the last cycle, declined to comment for this article. Several Republican groups \u2014 who by law can receive larger contributions than individual candidates \u2014 have declined to comment, or did not respond to requests for comment, on what they plan to do with their donations from Childs. America First Action, a super PAC that supports President Trump, received $250,000 from Childs in the 2018 election cycle. \u201cThe contribution was spent in 2018,\u201d said America First Action President Brian Walsh when contacted by email. \u201cNo further comment.\u201d Club for Growth Action, a conservative group that received $100,000 from Childs in the 2018 cycle, declined to answer questions about the fate of his contributions. \u201cWe have a policy that we don\u2019t discuss our donors,\u201d spokeswoman Rachael Slobodien said. The National Republican Congressional Committee, which coordinates GOP campaigns for the U.S. House, did not respond to questions on what it would do with the $123,900 the committee received from Childs in the last cycle. The NRCC, however, has demanded that Virginia Democrats return donations from Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who has denied charges of rape and assault by two women. The National Republican Senatorial Committee also declined to comment about the nearly $250,000 Childs gave to the committee in the last cycle. The NRSC joined McSally\u2019s 2018 campaign in attacking Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) for not immediately returning campaign donations from the founders of Backpage, a classified advertising website that was seized by federal agents as part of a child sex-trafficking investigation.","30":"THE PROGNOSIS Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), sponsor of a sweeping Medicare-for-all bill.\u00a0(Salwan Georges\/The Washington Post) Rep. Pramila Jayapal\u2019s sweeping Medicare-for-all bill embraced by more than 100 House Democrats reflects the influence of hard-line liberal groups and unions. These players don't form the\u00a0typical lineup of mainstream Democratic think tanks and activist groups that often help shape Democratic policy. Instead of consulting with influential organizations such as\u00a0the Center for American Progress or Families USA \u2014 two groups deeply\u00a0involved in the crafting of the 2010 Affordable Care Act \u2014 staff for the Washington Democrat invited feedback over the past few months\u00a0from a slew of groups further to the left. The result: Legislation that goes significantly further than the first Medicare-for-all bill laid out a year and a half ago by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), envisioning not only an even more generous array of benefits but also proposing to overhaul the very method by which Medicare pays clinics and hospitals. To some progressives, this is a step (or steps) too far, as it would upend health coverage for tens of millions of Americans with workplace plans and could cost many times more than the ACA. While Jayapal\u2019s bill and other Medicare expansion measures will get a hearing in the House Budget Committee (probably next month), the major health committees are staying away from the legislation and\u00a0leadership hasn't said they will hold\u00a0a vote on it. But to the groups that were intimately involved in crafting the Jayapal bill, it\u2019s a dream come true. The measure bears the signs of close involvement by National Nurses United, the Center for Popular Democracy, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, Public Citizen, Social Security Works and other organizations that say the ACA didn\u2019t go nearly far enough in ensuring all Americans have access to a generous range of health benefits. Jayapal\u2019s bill would provide everyone in the United States \u2014 including\u00a0undocumented immigrants \u2014 with a full set of health benefits including dental care, long-term care and vision\u00a0care, all services the Medicare program doesn\u2019t currently cover. Patients wouldn\u2019t be charged co-pays for doctor visits, nor would they have to meet a deductible before coverage kicked in. Sanders is expected to soon release an updated version of his Medicare-for-all bill, which his office confirmed\u00a0will more closely mirror Jayapal\u2019s bill than his initial version, including covering long-term care. \u201cAs a union, we\u2019re always coming at it from the perspective of the bargaining table,\u201d Kelly Coogan-Gehr, assistant director of public advocacy at National Nurses United, said of the Jayapal bill. \u201cSo we went to the bargaining table with very best legislation \u2026 It\u2019s incredible; it\u2019s a huge, historic accomplishment in terms of its comprehensiveness.\u201d National Nurses United, the country\u2019s largest nurses union and a big supporter of Sanders's 2016 presidential bid, and disability rights groups played a major role in ensuring the legislation includes\u00a0long-term care. And NNU\u00a0achieved another goal: Jayapal\u2019s bill would essentially halt Medicare\u2019s experimentation with value-based payments\u00a0in which doctors and hospitals are paid based on their results and not just the volume of services provided. Most health-policy experts stress a need for value-based payments as a way of encouraging better and more efficient care \u2013 especially considering the United States spends far more on health care per person than any other nation. Yet some advocates on the far left frown on this approach, charging that it penalizes doctors who treat the sickest and most vulnerable patients. This component of Jayapal\u2019s bill is just one way the measure tries to move Medicare in a drastically different direction. It would also upend Medicare\u2019s reimbursement system \u2014 in which providers are compensated for each service they perform \u2014 by instead giving lump-sum payments to hospitals and nursing homes based on their estimated costs. Regional directors would negotiate this annual \u201cglobal budget\u201d with each institution and reevaluate the sum every quarter. Facilities wouldn\u2019t be allowed to use the funds for capital improvements, marketing, political donations or bonuses to employees. The bill would dramatically change the way Medicare\u00a0pays providers, opening the door for hospitals in different parts of the country to receive different payments for the same service. Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden (Larry French\/Getty Images for MoveOn) The Jayapal bill would overhaul the U.S. health-care system so dramatically that summoning broad public support for it seems like a tall order. That\u2019s a big reason why groups such as CAP are a lot more interested in several bills proposing more modest coverage expansions, such as adding a Medicare-type \u201cpublic option\u201d plan to the marketplaces, for example. \u201cPeople are attached to the public option.\u00a0They see it as unfinished business,\u201d Jennifer Epps-Addison, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a pragmatism to that for sure. [But] I think it was pragmatism that led to a lot of the problems with the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Supporters of the Jayapal bill insist there\u2019s a groundswell of grass-roots enthusiasm for a dramatic overhaul of\u00a0the country\u2019s\u00a0patchwork of private and public insurance plans. \u201cThese more incremental pieces of legislation the liberal think tanks feel safe with and concede as a step in the right direction \u2013 we\u2019re finding that does not move everyday people,\u201d Coogan-Gehr said. Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, said that \u201cthe donor class has this idea about what is possible and what is not possible.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise or shock or worry me at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t listen to the donor class. I don\u2019t let them tell me what is possible. We\u2019re going to define what is possible by what the people are demanding.\u201d A view of the corporate headquarters of Purdue Pharma\u00a0in Stamford, Conn.\u00a0 (JUSTIN LANE\/EPA-EFE\/REX) AHH: An Oklahoma judge refused a request from defendants to delay the first major trial of whether drug companies are responsible for driving the\u00a0opioid crisis, our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports.  \u201cThe wheels of justice .\u2009.\u2009. will continue to grind toward a trial date of May 28, 2019,\u201d Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman said after a more than two-hour hearing Friday. \u201cOklahoma is seeking payments that could exceed $1 billion from the companies to cover the costs of coping with the drug crisis,\u201d Lenny writes. \u201cThe outcome there \u2014 whether by trial or settlement \u2014 may provide an indication of how about 1,600 other cities, counties and Native American tribes may fare against the same companies and others.\u201d Three drug companies and 10 of their subsidiaries asked for a 100-day delay to a jury trial, and\u00a0lawyers for the companies plan to appeal the judge\u2019s decision. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma said it was \u201cdisappointed the court has denied its motion for a continuance. The facts show clearly that the state of Oklahoma has repeatedly failed to meet its obligations to produce critical information and documents to Purdue and the other defendants in this case.\u201d But the state argued that Purdue wanted\u00a0the postponement to prepare for a bankruptcy declaration that would move the case to bankruptcy court. OOF: In the first two months of the year, 206 cases of\u00a0measles were confirmed nationwide, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u2019s the highest year-to-date figure going back more than 25 years, our Post colleague Christopher Ingraham reports. It highlights \u201chow anti-vaccine sentiment and the rising incidence of vaccine refusal threaten to bring back a public health threat that had been declared eliminated nearly 20 years ago,\u201d he writes. This year\u2019s total is\u00a0more than the yearly totals for all but three years since 2000, when measles was declared eliminated. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there will be a record total of cases by the end of 2019. \u201cIn 2015, for instance, there were 154 cases in the first two months of the year followed by 34 for the remainder of the year, putting it at right about average relative to the past decade\u2019s annual totals,\u201d Christopher writes. Along with Washington state, which is the location of many of this year\u2019s reported cases, there are ongoing outbreaks in New York, Texas and Illinois, according to the CDC. OUCH: A new case study from the CDC revealed details of a 2017 case of an unvaccinated 6-year-old in Oregon who contracted tetanus and accumulated more than $800,000 in medical charges\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 before that, it had been more than three decades since the state saw a case of tetanus in children.  \u201cThe child was playing on a farm when he cut his head on something, the report said. His parents cleaned and stitched the wound at home, but alarming symptoms emerged six days later,\u201d our Post colleague Amy B Wang reports. \u201cThe boy\u2019s jaw began clenching, and his neck and back were arched \u2014 a trademark indication of tetanus called opisthotonus that is caused by involuntary muscle spasms.\u201d The boy was taken to a pediatric hospital, where a tetanus diagnosis was just the start of what would be a lengthy hospital stay for the child. He was in the intensive care unit for 47 days, and 10 days later was transferred to a rehabilitation enter for another two-and-a-half weeks. \u201cIn all, the boy\u2019s medical charges in the hospital amounted to $811,929 \u2014 which did not include the cost of being airlifted to the hospital or of inpatient rehabilitation, according to the CDC,\u201d Amy writes. \u201cThe complex and prolonged care led to the high treatment cost,\u201d an author of the report, Judith Guzman-Cottrill, told The Post. \u201cIn contrast, the cost of one DTaP dose is somewhere around $24-$30 a dose, and this illness could have been prevented with five doses of DTaP vaccine.\u201d Amy adds the family, who was counseled on getting the child up to date on his vaccinations, declined to do so, and declined a follow-up dose of the DTaP vaccine that was given to the boy when he first arrived at the hospital. \u2014 Puerto Rico has started reducing by an average of 25 percent the food stamp benefits used by more than 1 million residents, our Post colleague Jeff Stein reports, as federal lawmakers have not yet doled out additional emergency disaster funding to the U.S. territory still recovering after Hurricane Maria in 2017. The food-stamp benefits have been cut as a way to sustain the program that has seen a growth in demand following Maria, a spokesman for Puerto Rico\u2019s Department of Family Affairs told Jeff. \u201cThe reductions bring the benefit levels back to where they were before the hurricane,\u201d Jeff writes. \u201cThe benefit cut, caused by an impasse among federal lawmakers over aid funding for the U.S. territory, has sparked new fears among Puerto Ricans about a critical lifeline for poorer residents amid an explosion of hunger since the hurricane hit.\u201d Various proposals\u00a0to fund the\u00a0program have emerged, but none have been approved. The Trump administration supported a package by Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) that included funding for the territory\u2019s food stamps in a separate bill to provide\u00a0financial aid to farmers in states like\u00a0Georgia. But there\u2019s no vote scheduled. In January, Democratic lawmakers approved funding for Puerto Rico that goes beyond Perdue\u2019s legislation, Jeff writes, adding that some Senate Democrats want similar measures included in Perdue\u2019s package. \u2014 More than 2,000 migrants have been quarantined at immigrant detention centers around the country because of mumps outbreaks and other illnesses. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement health officials have been notified about 236 confirmed or probable mumps cases among detainees in 51 facilities across the country in the last year, compared with no detected cases between January 2016 and February 2018, Reuters\u2019s Mica Rosenberg and Kristina Cooke report. Since January, there have been 18 detainees with confirmed or probable cases of mumps at the privately-run Pine Prairie facility in Louisiana, compared with zero cases last year. In February, 288 people were quarantined at the facility. In immigration detention facilities in Texas, there have been 186 mumps cases since October, the largest outbreak in centers in the state in years, Mica and Kristina report.

President Trump is expected to ask Congress for an additional $8.6 billion on March 11 to help pay for the wall on the southern border with Mexico: Trump meets with tornado survivors in Alabama:","31":"Congress on Thursday approved a massive budget deal to avert an impending government shutdown, and President Trump promised to sign it, but only after announcing he would also declare a national emergency so he can get more money for a border wall. Moments after Trump disclosed his intentions in a phone call with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), McConnell announced the news on the Senate floor, ending days of uncertainty over whether the president would support the $333 billion spending deal, which includes less than a quarter of the money he\u2019s sought for a steel wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Senate swiftly passed the legislation on an 83-to-16 vote, and the House followed suit hours later, approving the bill 300 to 128 \u2014 veto-proof margins in both chambers. If Trump keeps his promise to sign the measure, it would avert a government shutdown that would have started Saturday and keep the government open through at least Sept. 30. \u201cI hope the president has learned, like I\u2019ve learned over the years, that a shutdown of the government, collapse of the government funding, is not good for him, not good for the Republicans, it\u2019s not good for the Democrats,\u201d Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) said in an interview after the vote. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for people\u2019s view of us in the world, either. And it\u2019s not good for the economy.\u201d Lawmakers had been eager to put shutdown politics behind them after a record 35-day funding lapse forced 800,000 federal workers to go without paychecks through Christmas and much of January. But a national emergency declaration, which would allow Trump to circumvent Congress and use the military to build his wall, would create a new set of problems. Many of Trump\u2019s GOP congressional allies called the move \u00adill-advised, and Democrats promised immediate action aimed at blocking it. And the declaration will probably face legal challenges from states, border residents, civil liberties groups and possibly congressional Democrats. Trump is expected to sign the budget deal and declare the national emergency in an appearance Friday morning, according to a senior White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said he plans to introduce a resolution of disapproval that would overturn the declaration, calling it a \u201ca gross abuse of power that cannot be tolerated.\u201d Under the National Emergencies Act, House passage of a disapproval resolution would trigger automatic consideration by the Senate, where a simple majority vote would be required to agree to it. Given opposition from some Republicans, that raises the prospect that a disapproval resolution would pass the narrowly divided Senate in an embarrassing rebuke to Trump \u2014 a scenario McConnell privately warned the president about recently. That would force Trump to contemplate issuing the first veto of his presidency, which the president\u2019s critics in Congress would probably lack the votes to override. But Nadler said that if their resolution is vetoed, House Democrats would challenge the emergency declaration in court. McConnell has been warning against an emergency declaration publicly and privately for weeks, but on Thursday he told senators he had informed the president he would support the move. According to two officials with knowledge of the exchanges who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, Trump had been leaning against supporting the congressional spending bill but relented after several conversations with McConnell, who then announced his agreement to go along with an emergency declaration. Although Trump has been hinting for weeks at plans to declare a national emergency, his decision caught some lawmakers by surprise and divided Republicans. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said that an emergency declaration would \u201cbe a mistake.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to do it this way,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the way we should be doing these sorts of things. I actually think that there\u2019s a real constitutional question about it.\u201d The White House Counsel\u2019s Office has warned Trump against declaring a national emergency, calling it a \u201chigh litigation risk,\u201d according to a person with knowledge of the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal private deliberations. Lawyers encouraged Trump to reprogram money without declaring a national emergency. But the president has been inclined toward the declaration, in part because he sees it as an avenue to more wall money, according to administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Republican lawmakers also warned that an emergency declaration would set a bad precedent for a future Democratic president \u2014 and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) suggested that if Trump is going to declare a national emergency to build his wall, a Democratic president might take the same step to address gun violence. The 1,169-page legislation passed Thursday was the product of painstaking bipartisan negotiations in the three weeks since the last shutdown ended, a timeline Trump imposed on Congress to force lawmakersto come up with a deal. It would fund nine Cabinet departments and dozens of other agencies through Sept. 30, including Homeland Security, Commerce, Agriculture, and Transportation. The compromise provides $1.375 billion for 55 miles of new fences along the border in Texas, far short of the $5.7 billion Trump had sought for 234 miles of steel walls. The final number for border barriers is also less than deals that were on the table last year. The legislation was released just before midnight Wednesday, giving lawmakers and the White House very little time to review it before voting. Lawmakers defended the rushed timeline because of the impending shutdown deadline. After getting burned by Trump in December on a spending bill the Senate passed and the president disavowed, McConnell wanted to move as fast as possible to a vote following Trump\u2019s assurance of support. The majority leader was in such a hurry to announce Trump\u2019s backing and call the vote Thursday that he interrupted Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) in the middle of a speech about biofuels, drawing wrathful exclamations and glares from the longtime Iowa lawmaker. Some liberals were unhappy with the bill, arguing no money at all should go to border barriers. They also complained that overall funding for the Homeland Security Department increases under the bill, and that the legislation does not do enough to limit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency\u2019s detention authority. Democratic negotiators included language they said should reduce ICE detention numbers over time, but Republicans say ICE will still have the flexibility to detain as many immigrants as agency officials deem appropriate. Some liberals and immigrant advocates agreed with the GOP assessment. In a joint statement Thursday, freshman Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) announced their opposition to the legislation, citing Trump\u2019s \u201cweaponization\u201d of federal immigration agencies. \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security does not deserve an increase in funding and that is why we intend to vote no on this funding package,\u201d the four lawmakers wrote. But in the end, Pelosi limited Democratic \u201cno\u201d votes to 19 and told reporters that many of those defectors would have been with her \u201cif we\u2019d needed their votes.\u201d Some conservatives also trashed the deal, with conservative television host Laura Ingraham terming it a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d that she predicted would lead to increased undocumented immigration. White House officials have closely held their precise plans on taking executive action, insisting that they had legal ways to secure more than $5.7 billion in funds without congressional approval but refusing to say exactly how they\u2019d do it. One reason they were circumspect is because they were waiting for final details of the congressional deal to be made public, so they could ascertain the level of resources they would need to redirect from other programs, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the internal plans. Traditionally, moving money from one program to another requires congressional approval, but declaring a national emergency could give them more flexibility. Congressional aides said Thursday that they believe there is up to $21 billion in \u201cunobligated\u201d Defense Department funding that the president could target for construction of the wall. That includes $10 billion in military construction money in the fiscal 2019 budget and $11 billion in previous budgets that is not yet spent, numbers that U.S. officials disclosed weeks ago when Trump first floated the idea of declaring a national emergency. For weeks, defense officials have been informally reviewing military construction projects that they could cancel or delay if Trump seeks military construction money to pay for the wall. Defense officials had declined to provide specifics, saying that no emergency declaration had been made. A central promise of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign was that he would somehow make Mexico pay for the construction of the border wall, but since becoming president, all of his efforts have focused on using U.S. taxpayer money to finance the projects. Trump has said that a pending revised trade agreement with Mexico and Canada effectively fulfills his promise, but it is unclear whether Congress will approve that trade agreement. And there is no language in the agreement that would create any new funding mechanism to provide money for a wall.","32":"Good morning, Power People!\u00a0Suggestions, tips, ideas?

Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina and Kentucky have some of the highest rates of HIV transmissions in the nation. All except for Kentucky and Arkansas are GOP-led states that have opted out of expanding the low-income health insurance program to people earning 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 meaning they have uninsured rates well above the national average. As a result, the Department of Health and Human Services will have to rely even more heavily on federally funded community health centers to distribute PrEP \u2014 the once-a-day pill that protects users against HIV infection \u2014 as the agency tries to progress toward\u00a0its goal of halting 90 percent of transmissions in a decade. \u201c[Community] Health Centers are a key point of entry of people undiagnosed with HIV,\u201d said George Sigounas, administrator of the agency\u2019s Health Resources and Services Administration, adding that nearly 2 million Americans get an HIV test and more than 160,000 patients receive\u00a0HIV-related care at these centers every year. Brett Giroir, the HHS assistant secretary for health, said the agency\u00a0didn't assume those states would expand Medicaid -- or that there would be any other major changes to the country's insurance structure -- as they wrote the details of the plan.\u00a0\"I will say up front we did not assume any dramatic changes in the landscape of insurance, Medicaid [or] other coverage,\" Giroir said.\u00a0 Sigounas and other top HHS officials were addressing new appointees to the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV\/AIDS (PACHA) \u2014 a group that sat dormant for more than a year after President Trump\u00a0fired its remaining members at the end of 2017. The administration appointed a slew of new experts to the panel this week, on the heels of a budget proposal that requests $291 million for the new HIV initiative. The officials laid out more details in a meeting\u00a0yesterday afternoon for how they propose to put in motion the ambitious initiative, which Trump first announced in his State of the Union address. In additional to the seven states, they\u2019re also homing in on 48 counties where more than 50 percent of new HIV cases are diagnosed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had [National Institutes of Health] do things, we\u2019ve had [Centers for Disease Control] do things, but this is the first time we\u2019ve come together with a team \u2026 with a secretary of HHS who has completely bought into this,\u201d said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\u00a0 \u201cThis is unique,\u201d Fauci added.\u00a0 CDC Director Robert Redfield, a key instigator of the project, said it\u2019s the geographic concentration of HIV transmissions that makes him confident the administration\u2019s goals are realistic. \u201cI will tell you, when Dr. Fauci and I saw this map, we looked at it and said, 'Wow, this is a really focused challenge,' \u201d Redfield said, referring to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u00a0\u201cWhen this map came up we said, 'This is doable.\u2019 \u201d HHS Secretary Alex Azar: But plenty of obstacles stand in the way. There\u2019s the issue of a persistent, substantial uninsured rate among lower-income Americans, particularly in the areas of the South the administration is trying to target. And, as I detailed in this Health 202, Democrats in Congress would have to be willing to appropriate the new funds the administration is requesting to follow through on\u00a0all its goals. The HHS officials expressed optimism in that regard, saying they had met earlier this week with House Democratic members of the HIV\/AIDS Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus, including Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.) and Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.). Jackson Lee's district includes Houston, one of the areas the Trump administration is targeting in its efforts. She spoke positively about the initiative's focus on African-American and Latino men -- a population disporportionately affected by the spread of HIV -- telling\u00a0me she doesn't want to \"look opportunity in the face and ignore it.\" \"Those of us who have been engaged in this for years are looking for any bright light that would address the HIV population in the 21st century,\" she said. And while Democrats appear open to working with the administration on the issue, there are stark differences between the two parties on what health insurance \u2014 whether public or private \u2014\u00a0should look like in the United States. Despite\u00a0requesting extra funds for HIV mitigation, the president\u2019s budget also called for sharp spending reductions to Medicaid even though more than 2 in 5 Americans with the virus depend on the program, my Washington Post colleagues Amy Goldstein, Laurie McGinley and Lena H. Sun report. \u201cSuch a contradiction \u2014 giving while also taking away \u2014 runs through the budget arithmetic for many of the Trump administration\u2019s health-care priorities,\u201d Amy, Laurie and Lena write. \u201cIn addition to combating HIV, the president has taken aim at childhood cancer and the opioid crisis, but his budget would undermine all those efforts by shrinking the health infrastructure that people struggling with those issues rely on while throttling back national cancer research spending \u2014 even as it offers discrete pots of money for those causes, policymakers say.\" \u201cIf you\u2019re cutting Medicaid, you\u2019re taking the legs out from underneath the system\u201d of help for people with the AIDS virus, Jennifer Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told them.

Under Article V of the Constitution, a new convention can be held to amend the founding document if two-thirds of the states request one. That\u2019s 34 states. It\u2019s an improbable push. No one has ever used this mechanism, though many have tried to do so on the right and the left. Until Walker did it in 2012, on the other hand, no governor in U.S. history had survived a recall election either. Intense fights have been playing out at the state level over the past few years around whether to call a constitutional convention. In 2017, Walker supported a successful push for Wisconsin to become the 28th state to do so. Wyoming and Arizona also joined that year. But other states that had supported conventions in the past rescinded their resolutions, including Maryland and Nevada. Walker plans to make trips to South Carolina and Minnesota during this legislative session to encourage those states to call for a convention to enact a balanced-budget amendment. This summer he hopes to visit Idaho, Montana, Kentucky and Virginia \u2013 four other top target states \u2013 to make the case. Lower on his priority list are Washington, Nevada, Maine and even Connecticut. Walker noted that he got to know a lot of local leaders around the country during his 2016 run for president and his tenure as chairman of the Republican Governors Association. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) speaks during a hearing of the Senate Budget Committee in January. Scott Walker may run for his seat in 2022. (Alex Brandon\/AP) -- Walker told me he is keeping the door open to another run for statewide office in Wisconsin. He noted that Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has said in the past that he won\u2019t seek a third term in 2022, which would create an opening that intrigues him. He said he\u2019s not sure if Johnson will \u201cfollow through with what he said previously.\u201d \u201cI would defer to him,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIf he chose to run again, I wouldn\u2019t run.\u201d He could also run against Gov. Tony Evers, the Democrat who defeated him, in a 2022 rematch. \u201cAs you know, I think six months is a lifetime in politics,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI\u2019m not ruling anything out. My wife \u2026 told me, \u2018Don\u2019t pretend you wouldn\u2019t ever running again.\u2019\u201d For now, he plans to offer conservative media commentary and write a forthcoming column. He\u2019s joined a speaker\u2019s bureau and may guest-host a news-talk AM radio show in Milwaukee from time to time. He\u2019s staying engaged with parochial issues important to the state. He appeared, for example, at the Wisconsin GOP\u2019s 8th Congressional District convention this past Saturday. \u201cI wanted to go around and thank people,\u201d he said. -- President Trump and congressional Republicans slashed taxes while jacking up spending during the two years they had unified control of government. This will result in annual deficits topping $1 trillion for the foreseeable future. It\u2019s unprecedented to run such massive deficits when the economy is booming. The national debt eclipsed $22 trillion last month. The federal government will need to spend $482 billion next year just on interest payments, more than the entire budget for Medicaid. By 2024, according to the budget released by the White House last week, the U.S. government will spend more servicing the debt than on the entire military. -- Walker declined to directly criticize Trump or GOP leaders for their specific roles in adding to the deficit. He prefers the pox-on-all-their-houses message and to blame Washington writ large. \u201cWashington\u2019s got their head buried in the sand,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth parties share a significant amount of the blame for the failure to act. Maybe one more than the other.\u201d He complained that both parties often come together and agree to omnibus deals that give everyone what they want. \u201cSomeone asked if I believe in bipartisanship,\u201d he quipped. \u201cI said it depends.\u201d Asked how Trump is faring generally, Walker said \u201csubstantively great.\u201d Like many other Republicans, Walker added, \u201cThere are times I wish he would tweet or say things a hair differently.\u201d -- Walker noted that he had to balance the budget each of the eight years he was governor, including when the economy was still in the doldrums after the Great Recession. \u201cIt forces tough decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t allow you to push them off. \u2026 That\u2019s been a godsend for us. \u2026 Depending on which way the pendulum swings I may not always like the decision, but at least it\u2019s being made.\u201d -- I asked why Republicans are talking so much less about the debt than they did when Barack Obama was president. \u201cYou kind of have these ebbs and flows,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s like any other issue. In 2012, we weren\u2019t talking about border security. \u2026 That doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t an issue. \u2026 It\u2019s who are the voices, who are the personalities.\u201d He said he\u2019s going to do everything he can to \u201celevate\u201d the issue during the 2020 presidential election. \u201cThis is really going to have to be state driven,\u201d he said.\u00a0 President Trump appears at a rally for Scott Walker on Oct. 24, 2018, in Mosinee, Wis. (Mike Roemer\/AP) -- A balanced-budget amendment is a less fashionable idea than it was during the 1980s and 1990s. In 1995, a proposed amendment passed the House and failed by just one vote in the Senate. Otherwise it would have gone to the states for ratification. Liberals believe a balanced-budget amendment, if enacted, would inevitably force steep cuts to Medicare and Social Security. They also say it would worsen economic downturns by forcing the government to raise taxes and cut spending when a slowing economy results in less government revenue. Some conservatives worry that an amendment to the Constitution would force tax increases to close the deficit because it\u2019s too politically difficult to cut popular programs. (In columns last year, George Will made the case for a balanced-budget amendment and Catherine Rampell argued against it.) -- Separate from the substance, if Walker got his way, there are fears among legal scholars about the possibility of a \u201crunaway\u201d convention that would alter our founding charter in unintended ways. After all, the first Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia was supposed to only clean up the Articles of Confederation \u2013 not toss them out and start over. There would be nothing to stop a constitutional convention, once it convened, from taking up issues far beyond its original mandate, and tiny states like Vermont or Wyoming would be on equal footing with megastates like California and Texas. This is why Antonin Scalia, among others, was against the idea. Walker countered that 38 states \u2013 three-quarters of the country \u2013 would need to ratify any changes that a convention made to the Constitution. -- Loren Enns, the president of the group Walker is joining, was a successful network engineer for Cisco Systems and a computer engineer for Microsoft who grew alarmed about the debt over the years. In 2015, he decided to focus full-time on the nonprofit. Enns, 46 of Clearwater, Fla., has recruited a board of directors that includes conservatives like former governor Mike Huckabee, as well as former senators Judd Gregg, George Allen and Norm Coleman. He reached out to Walker shortly after his term ended and then pitched him on joining the initiative. \u201cIt is the biggest threat that we face as a country,\u201d Enns said. -- Regardless of the outcome of the fight, embracing the role of fiscal hawk dovetails with \u2013 and could burnish \u2013 the national brand Walker has spent the past decade trying to cultivate. In the long-term, decrying the debt while Republicans in D.C. continue to spend like drunken sailors on shore leave could tee up a useful contrast against potential rivals who currently sit in the Senate if Walker were to run for president again in 2024, 2028 or even 2032. He will turn 65 the day before that election. There is even a precedent. \u201cYou look way back,\u201d Walker told me. \u201cRonald Reagan talked a lot about this issue between being governor of California and president.\u201d WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Bob Mueller obtained court-approved warrants to search the emails of Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael Cohen in July 2017, according to search warrants unsealed this morning. Devlin Barrett, Matt Zapotosky and Rosalind Helderman report: \u201c[They] offer new insight into how Mueller and his team handed off a key part of the Cohen investigation to federal prosecutors in New York in early 2018, and how much evidence prosecutors already had against Cohen even before they searched his office, home, and hotel room in April of that year.\u201d White House growth projections from Page 529 of the 2019 Economic Report of the President. The red line shows the forecast if no additional policies are implemented. -- Trump has promised an economic boom that will last for years to come, but that\u2019s unlikely without Congress passing major new legislation, according to new estimates released this morning by the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Heather Long reports: \u201cTo achieve about 3 percent growth for the next decade, Trump would need a big infrastructure bill, more tax cuts, additional deregulation, and policies that transition more people off government aid and into full-time jobs, according to the 2019 Economic Report of the President. The report shows for the first time that the White House is predicting a lot weaker growth if all of those new policies do not come through. Growth would be about 2.5 percent in 2022 if no additional policies are implemented, according to White House calculations. By 2026, growth could fall to about 2 percent, the model suggests. \u201cA lot is riding on whether Trump can achieve his promised 3 percent growth. Without it, his tax cuts would add substantially more to the debt than they already have. The 3 percent White House growth prediction \u2014 which is used in the president\u2019s budget and has been criticized by outside experts as a \u2018gimmick\u2019 \u2014 also assumes more deregulation, especially in the finance industry, and a push for \u2018improving self-sufficiency\u2019 by placing more work requirements on recipients of government aid.\u201d Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney might soon get a promotion. (Evan Vucci\/AP) --\u00a0Trump is expected to\u00a0name Mick Mulvaney\u00a0as the\u00a0official\u00a0White House chief of\u00a0staff, dropping the \u201cacting\u201d part of his title.\u00a0Politico\u2019s Nancy Cook reports:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that Mulvaney has successfully navigated a tumultuous West Wing.

(Deanna Paul) FALLOUT FROM THE MOSQUE MASSACRE: -- Trump still has not directly condemned the white supremacy invoked by the alleged perpetrator of the New Zealand shooting at two mosques.\u00a0Nor has the president expressed explicit sympathy with Muslims around the globe, highlighting his fraught and combative relationship with Islam. Ashley Parker and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cBy Monday morning, Trump still had not heeded the plea of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern \u2014 whom he spoke with on the phone Friday \u2014 to offer his nation\u2019s \u2018sympathy and love for all Muslim communities.\u2019 But the president had contorted himself into a victim of the tragedy, griping on Twitter: \u2018The Fake News Media is working overtime to blame me for the horrible attack in New Zealand.\u2019 \u2026 The president has a long history of disparaging Muslims and other minorities, while simultaneously refusing to forcefully condemn white supremacy and violent nationalism. -- In contrast to her boss, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen connected the New Zealand attack to recent acts of racist violence in the United States. Bloomberg News\u2019s Daniel Flatley reports: \u201c\u2018We, too, have seen the face of such evil with attacks in places such as Charlottesville, Pittsburgh, and Charleston,\u2019 Nielsen said in a speech at George Washington University in Washington.\u00a0\u2026 Nielsen on Monday pledged that her department would seek to prevent attacks like the New Zealand incident. \u2026 \u2018We spend more and more of our time talking about domestic terrorism,\u2019 she said.\u201d -- The House Judiciary Committee is planning to hold a hearing in early April on the rise of white nationalism.

(J. Scott Applewhite\/AP) SCOTUS WATCH:  -- The Supreme Court is divided over a Republican-drawn plan for legislative districts in Virginia that raised suspicions of discrimination against black voters in a lower court. Robert Barnes report: \u201cSeveral justices wondered whether the case was properly before the Supreme Court. One seemed to want a delay that would effectively leave the current map in place for this fall\u2019s election. \u2026 A panel of lower-court judges ruled last year that 11 Virginia House of Delegates districts were racially gerrymandered and ordered a new map to correct them. \u2026 The first issue for the court was whether the Republican-led House had the legal standing to appeal the panel\u2019s decision. Virginia\u2019s governor and attorney general, who are Democrats, say it does not, and the Department of Justice agreed with them. So, it seemed, did Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. \u2026 Conservative justices seemed skeptical of the lower court\u2019s decision that the House leadership had taken race into consideration too much.\u201d -- The justices accepted two key criminal justice cases for next term, including one\u00a0questioning\u00a0whether the UConstitution requires unanimous juries for criminal convictions. Robert Barnes reports: \u201cLouisiana and Oregon do not require unanimity for major crimes, and attorneys representing defendants convicted in those states for years have urged the Supreme Court to revisit the question. \u2026 The Louisiana case was brought by Evangelisto Ramos, convicted of second-degree murder in 2016 on a 10-to-2 jury vote and sentenced to life in prison. His attorneys said Louisiana\u2019s law was a Jim Crow attempt to diminish the impact of African Americans serving on juries.\u201d The other case, Kahler v. Kansas, asks whether a state may abolish the insanity defense. James Kraig Kahler \u201cwas convicted and sentenced to death for killing his wife, Karen, his daughters Lauren and Emily, and Karen\u2019s grandmother in 2009. Kahler\u2019s attorneys argued he was so mentally ill he did not understand his actions. But, \u2018in Kansas, along with four other states, it is not a defense to criminal liability that mental illness prevented the defendant from knowing his actions were wrong,\u2019 Washington lawyer Jeffrey T. Green told the Supreme Court.\u201d But the court turned down the case of a Georgia death-row inmate\u00a0 convicted of killing his sister-in-law and raping his estranged wife but who discovered that a juror in the case harbored racist sentiments. The justices also refused to take the case against a bed-and-breakfast owner who declined to offer a room to a lesbian couple. -- The high court also said it will consider whether the Beltway sniper, Lee Boyd Malvo, can challenge his sentence of life in prison without parole. Malvo was 17 when he and John Allen Muhammad, who was executed in 2009, killed 10 people in a series of sniper attacks around the D.C. area. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent rulings on juvenile murderers, which are retroactive, could trigger a new sentencing for Malvo.

ProPublica\u2019s Robert Faturechi and Justin Elliott obtained a sealed search warrant: \u201cAgents were authorized to use the megadonor\u2019s hands and face to unlock any phones that required fingerprint or facial scans. \u2026 [The warrant]\u00a0also shows that the government took a more aggressive approach with the Trump ally than was previously known, entering his office and removing records \u00a0\u2026 The search warrant cites three potential crimes that authorities are investigating: conspiracy, money laundering and violations of the law barring covert lobbying on behalf of foreign officials.\u201d The warrant also appears to connect Broidy for the first time to the Miami Beach club promoter Joel Rouseau, linked to a shadowy company called Intelligent Resources: \u201cThere is a company by that name incorporated in Miami Beach by a Joel Rousseau \u2026 The search warrant does not describe Rousseau or Intelligent Resources\u2019 role in the case. Rousseau\u2019s Instagram account shows him bouncing from Rio to Paris to Ibiza, frequently surrounded by models. \u2026 Filings in a court case over unpaid taxes describe Rousseau as an \u2018entrepreneur\u2019 with income swinging from under $1,000 for 2009 to over $2 million in 2013.

After he won the 2016 election, the German bank shifted into damage-control mode in a bid to tamp down scrutiny of its deals with the president. The New York Times\u2019s David Enrich reports: \u201cDeutsche Bank officials have quietly argued to regulators, lawmakers and journalists that Mr. Trump was not a priority for the bank or its senior leaders and that the lending was the work of a single, obscure division. But interviews with more than 20 current and former Deutsche Bank executives and board members, most of them with direct knowledge of the Trump relationship, contradict the bank\u2019s narrative. ... Mr. Trump and Deutsche Bank were deeply entwined, their symbiotic bond born of necessity and ambition on both sides: a real estate mogul made toxic by polarizing rhetoric and a pattern of defaults, and a bank with intractable financial problems and a history of misconduct.\" -- The Justice Department might soon decide whether it will prosecute a former Obama White House counsel with ties to Paul Manafort as part of its crackdown on illegal foreign lobbying. The Times\u2019s Kenneth P. Vogel and Katie Benner report: \u201cThe case involving the lawyer, Gregory B. Craig, was transferred in January from federal prosecutors in New York to those in Washington \u2026 The investigation centers on whether Mr. Craig should have disclosed work he did in 2012 \u2014 while he was a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom \u2014 on behalf of the Russia-aligned government of Viktor F. Yanukovych, then the president of Ukraine. The work was steered to Mr. Craig by Paul Manafort, who was then a political consultant collecting millions of dollars from clients in former Soviet states. \u2026 Mr. Craig, 74, would be the first Democrat to be charged in a case spinning out of the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\u201d -- British political consultants who worked for Trump\u2019s campaign allegedly covered up Cambridge Analytica secrets. The Daily Beast\u2019s Nico Hines reports: \u201cThe High Court in London heard on Monday that Cambridge Analytica was up to its old tricks from beyond the grave\u2014by surreptitiously trying to halt investigations that could expose allegedly nefarious tactics before the company was shut down for good. \u2026 A lawyer representing a New York professor, who believes his private data was misused by the notorious campaign operatives, claims Cambridge Analytica\u2019s data secrets are being shielded from justice and exposure by administrators in the pay of a shadow company set up by a band of executives linked to the Trump campaign veterans.\u201d -- White House lawyers believe they\u00a0will get to review in advance any version of Bob Mueller's report that Attorney General William Barr plans to submit to Congress. CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown, Jeremy Diamond, Kevin Liptak and Sarah Westwood report: \u201cThe attorneys want the White House to have an opportunity to claim executive privilege over information drawn from documents and interviews with White House officials. \u2026 Justice Department lawyers could advise [the president]\u00a0against certain assertions if they don't feel it's legally defensible. If Trump does assert executive privilege, the decision could be litigated in court if it's challenged, which Democrats would almost certainly do.\" -- A USA Today-Suffolk poll shows that Trump's relentless attacks on Mueller's probe have eroded public trust slightly in recent months, as more Americans agree\u00a0with Trump\u2019s characterization of the probe as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d USA Today\u2019s Susan Page and Deborah Barfield Berry report: \u201cSupport for the House of Representatives to seriously consider impeaching the president has dropped since last October by 10 percentage points, to 28 percent. \u2026 Twenty-eight percent say they have a lot of trust in former FBI director Mueller's investigation to be fair and accurate. That's the lowest level to date and down 5 points since December. In comparison, 30 percent express a lot of trust in Trump's denials, the highest to date. \u2026 Fifty percent say they agree with Trump's assertion that the special counsel's investigation is a \u2018witch hunt.\u2019\u201d Trump touted the poll in a tweet yesterday. -- The last prosecutor who oversaw Michael Flynn\u2019s plea deal has left Mueller\u2019s office, signaling the special counsel is unlikely to bring more charges against the former national security adviser. Yahoo News\u2019s Luppe B. Luppen reports: \u201cThe end of [Zainab] Ahmad\u2019s detail is sure to be seen as another indication that the special counsel\u2019s investigation is winding down. \u2026 Ahmad and Brandon Van Grack together signed Flynn\u2019s guilty plea agreement in November 2017. \u2026 Van Grack left the special counsel\u2019s office earlier this year and was recently appointed the head the Justice Department\u2019s foreign influence unit.\u201d -- Flynn\u2019s family members are publicly clashing over QAnon, the conspiracy theory whose believers have thrown their support behind the disgraced ex-general. The Daily Beast\u2019s Will Sommer reports: \u201cMany QAnon fans, who have seized on a series of internet clues posted by the anonymous Q to imagine a world in which Trump is engaged in a secret war against high-ranking Democratic pedophiles, think Flynn is, in fact, secretly working with Mueller to help Trump defeat the deep state. \u2026 Because of Flynn\u2019s role in QAnon lore, believers of the conspiracy theory are desperate for him to confirm that QAnon is real. But Flynn has never discussed the conspiracy theory publicly. Into that void, his family members have stepped\u2014but not with a unified voice. Instead, they\u2019ve come down on opposite sides of the conspiracy, with his siblings Joseph Flynn and Barbara Redgate eagerly signaling support to QAnon believers, and his son Michael Flynn Jr. becoming a vocal QAnon skeptic.\u201d House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep.

(Susan Walsh\/AP) OVERSIGHT FROM THE NEW CONGRESS: -- House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said his panel has already received tens of thousands of documents for its\u00a0investigation into whether Trump has abused his presidential power. Rachael Bade reports: \u201cRecipients of the requests had until Monday to respond to dozens of questions pertaining to such issues as Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, hush-payments for women alleging affairs with the president and the firing of former FBI director James B. Comey. \u2026 The panel declined to specify which Trump officials, agencies and associates had answered the document requests. \u2026 Nadler said in the statement that the panel is still negotiating with many of the document-request recipients. Some have asked for subpoenas as well, the panel said.\u201d -- Senior House Democrats asked the FBI to launch a counter-intelligence investigation into Cindy Yang, the GOP donor who founded the Florida massage parlor allegeldy frequented by Bob Kraft and who has apparently been trying to sell access to Trump and his\u00a0advisers. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cIn a letter\u00a0to the heads of the FBI, national intelligence agencies and Secret Service, the top Intelligence and Judiciary committee Democrats in the Senate and House asked for investigations into \u2018credible allegations of potential human trafficking, as well as unlawful foreign lobbying, campaign finance and other activities\u2019 by Li \u2018Cindy\u2019 Yang, a naturalized U.S. citizen from China. \u2026 Yang operates a company called GY US Investments, which offered prospective clients a chance to rub elbows with Trump and other powerful politicians through dinners, fundraisers and other events \u2014 including at Mar-a-Lago.\u201d -- Civil liberties groups are urging the House Judiciary Committee to investigate whether the National Security Agency has overstepped its bounds on collecting Americans\u2019 data.

(Carlos Osorio\/AP) 2020 WATCH: -- Beto O\u2019Rourke has so far avoided specifics on the campaign trail as he encourages Democrats in early voting states to suggest their own solutions to the problems facing America. Jenna Johnson reports: \u201cIn the first five days of his campaign, O\u2019Rourke asked voters to shape him into the presidential candidate they want him to be, to help him draft a vision for America. He\u2019s operating without a campaign manager and with an often-exhausted skeleton staff, driving himself from Iowa to New Hampshire in a rented minivan and appearing at dozens of hastily organized events. \u2026 O\u2019Rourke has heavily focused not on specifics but on two sentiments: positivity and humility. \u2026 O\u2019Rourke, while not completely void of policy ideas, spends much more time detailing the challenges facing the country than suggesting fixes.\u201d -- The executive director of the Louisiana GOP was arrested in New Orleans this weekend for allegedly shoving a police officer on his wedding night. The Baton Rouge Advocate\u2019s Ramon Antonio Vargas reports: \u201cAccording to court records, a hotel manager and a police officer had asked GOP official Andrew Bautsch, 31, to leave an unnamed establishment at the Pontchartrain Hotel in the 2000 block of St. Charles Avenue about 1:30 a.m. Saturday. But Bautsch allegedly would not get onto an elevator leading out. The officer who arrested Bautsch was a member of the Orleans Levee District police force working an off-duty security detail at the hotel. That policeman booked Bautsch \u2014 apparently still dressed in his tuxedo \u2014 on municipal counts of criminal trespassing, resisting police and battery on an officer.\u201d The state party chairman\u00a0is standing by Bautsch and said he will contest the charges. -- Another top adviser to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) who left her office over sexual harassment allegations continued to be paid for months, according to the Washington Examiner\u2019s Naomi Lim and Alana Goodman: \u201cMarc Brumer, 32, the New York Democrat's communications director, resigned from Gillibrand's staff in spring 2017 after making at least one sexist remark that distressed and offended a more junior woman who worked as a scheduler, two former Gillibrand aides [said]. But Brumer continued to be paid despite his misconduct. He was not dismissed and was kept on Gillibrand's staff. He remained on the senator's payroll \u2018for about three months after the incident, even though he didn\u2019t do any work,\u2019 one former aide said.\u201d -- Gillibrand defended her office\u2019s handling of internal sexual harassment complaints during an MSNBC town hall. Politico\u2019s Elena Schneider reports: \u201cThe New York Democrat [said] that the Senate staffer\u2019s allegations \u2018did not rise to sexual harassment, but we did find evidence of derogatory comments,\u2019 adding that her senior aide Abbas Malik, who allegedly made unwanted sexual advances, \u2018was punished.\u2019\" -- On MSNBC, Gillibrand also expressed regrets for her \"A\" rating from the NRA when she represented a conservative House district. The Detroit Free Press\u2019s Kathleen Gray reports: \u201c\u2018My community didn\u2019t have the gun violence, so the biggest issue was hunting rights,\u2019 she said. \u2018My mother didn't just cook the Thanksgiving turkey, she shot the Thanksgiving turkey too.\u2019 Gillibrand, who grew up in upstate New York, said she supports universal background checks for gun purchases, restrictions on high-magazine ammunition clips and getting money out of politics so that gun manufacturers can't buy the support of politicians. While she accepts money from political action committees, she said she wants to switch to a system where campaigns are publicly financed.\u201d -- Gillibrand also claimed last night that \"immigration\u00a0is not a security issue.\" She said it's\u00a0\"an economic and a humanitarian, and a family issue.\u201d\u00a0(MSNBC) -- During her own CNN town hall last night in Jackson, Miss., Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said she backs a congressional proposal for a reparations study. Politico\u2019s Alex Thompson reports: \u201c\u2018I love the idea of this congressional commission,\u2019 she said at Jackson State, a historically black university. \u2018I believe it\u2019s time to start the national, full-blown conversation about reparations.\u2019\u201d The bill Warren was referring to was reintroduced by Rep.

The Times\u2019s Astead Herndon reports: \u201c\u2018I believe we need a constitutional amendment that protects the right to vote for every American citizen and makes sure that vote gets counted,\u2019 Ms. Warren said in response to a question about voter disenfranchisement. \u2018We need to put some federal muscle behind that, and we need to repeal every one of the voter suppression laws that is out there.\u2019 She then noted that most presidential candidates never campaign in Mississippi or her home state of Massachusetts during a general election because those are not battleground states in the Electoral College.\" -- The Los Angeles Times is the latest major publication to scrutinize Joe Biden\u2019s long voting record and highlight fundamental differences with\u00a0today\u2019s Democratic Party. Janet Hook runs through some of the apostasies: \u201c[Biden]\u00a0voted for a measure aimed at outlawing gay marriage in the 1990s. \u2026 He eulogized Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), who rose to prominence as a segregationist. He backed the Iraq war. Many of Biden\u2019s positions were well within the mainstream of the Democratic Party at the time he took them. But the party is now far more sensitive to discrimination against gays, sexual harassment and racial inequality than when Biden first came to Washington. \u2026 Biden\u2019s record, even though he has reversed himself on some issues, provides ammunition to skeptics who see him as a politician of another era \u2014 a beloved figure, but one whose time has come and gone.\u201d -- Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is brushing off concerns about her mistreatment of employees. \u201cI would first point to that over 60 of our former staff came together, everyone from chiefs of staff to people on the frontline that worked with me, that were in the car with me all day and said that they had a good experience working in our office,\u201d Klobuchar told NPR\u00a0for an interview that aired this morning. \u201cSecondly, I do have high standards. I do push people hard. I have high standards of myself of our staff and also for our nation. And so that is the way I'm going to look at this going forward.

Dean Phillips, a Jewish Democrat, shattered a moment meant to be about listening and learning \u2014 not politics. \u2026 Phillips told [Omar] that she had to apologize and said the group should publicly affirm Israel\u2019s right to exist and protect itself. \u2026 Rep. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), a Palestinian American who is critical of the Israeli government\u2019s treatment of the Palestinians, grew emotional and started to cry as she spoke of her grandmother\u2019s suffering in the West Bank at the hands of Israelis. \u2018She would treat you like a grandson,\u2019 she said to Phillips.\u201d -- Rep.

That\u2019s good business. Fox News also wants to avoid angering the legions of Trump fans who tune in for the overreaching commentary. That\u2019s good business, too. Or they\u2019re a sign of weakness,\u00a0as the No. 1 fan of Fox News believes.

The Siena College Research Institute reports on its latest poll: \u201cBy a 67-21 percent margin, New Yorkers say that Amazon cancelling its planned second headquarters in Queens was bad for New York. \u2026 \u2018More people think that Amazon, Governor Cuomo, Mayor de Blasio, the State Senate, and local Queens activists were villains in this saga than they were heroes. However, voters say the biggest villain was Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Only 12 percent call her hero, while 38 percent label her a villain,\u2019 [pollster Steven] Greenberg said.\u201d The poll also showed Ocasio-Cortez has a negative 31-44 percent favorability rating. -- Of the 895 spots available, only seven black students got into New York City\u2019s highly selective Stuyvesant High School.

But Mr. de Blasio\u2019s proposal to scrap the entrance exam for the schools and overhaul the admissions process has proved so divisive that the state\u2019s most prominent politicians, from Gov.

Others who communicated with him said he had spent some time railing privately against Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director. But they also said he appeared to be a little aimless, and the outpouring seemed to be more driven by a lack of structure. Mr. Trump had skipped his regular weekend trip to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, because of a family commitment that kept him grounded in Washington.\"\u00a0 -- \u201cThe real danger in so desensitizing ourselves to Trump\u2019s tweets is that we normalize deviant behavior and begin to accept what is unacceptable,\u201d Peter Wehner, an alum of the Reagan and both Bush White Houses, writes for the Atlantic. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a person with an advanced degree in psychology to see Trump\u2019s narcissism and lack of empathy, his vindictiveness and pathological lying, his impulsivity and callousness, his inability to be guided by norms, or his shamelessness and dehumanization of those who do not abide his wishes. His condition is getting worse, not better\u2014and there are now fewer people in the administration able to contain the president and act as a check on his worst impulses. \u2026 Donald Trump is not well, and as long as he is president, our nation is not safe.\u201d -- Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway brushed off questions about her husband\u2019s recent tweets criticizing Trump's mental state.

King\u2019s recent question, posed in a New York Times interview, may be appalling: 'White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization\u2014how did that language become offensive?'\u00a0But it is apt. 'That language' has an American past in need of excavation. Without such an effort, we may fail to appreciate the tenacity of the dogma it expresses, and the difficulty of eradicating it.

NATO countries have pledged to move toward spending 2 percent of GDP on defense. Merkel\u2019s government has pledged to increase spending to 1.5 percent by 2024. Merkel said Tuesday defense spending has increased as a share of GDP even as the economy has grown. She said long-term budget plans contain \u201cminimal data,\u201d and actual spending has always been revised upward. She highlighted the importance of foreign aid, saying Germany will continue its efforts on defense \u201cbut not at the expense of development aid.\u201d","36":"Senior Italian government officials greeted Xi on the tarmac, and tenor Andrea Bocelli sang for Xi and his wife at a state dinner. When Xi arrived at his five-star Roman hotel, a Chinese national flag was flying outside. But the most geopolitically important \u2014 and controversial \u2014 symbol of embrace came Saturday, when Italy formally agreed to be part of China\u2019s signature foreign policy and infrastructure project, known as the Belt and Road Initiative, becoming the first Group of Seven country to do so. At a ceremony at a Renaissance villa that also included the signing of other business and commercial agreements, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said his country was building a \u201cmore effective relationship\u201d with China. Italy, whose economy has sagged for decades, says the potential economic benefits are too great to pass up. But in pursuing the Belt and Road deal, Italy\u2019s populist government is breaking ranks with the most powerful countries of the West, defying the wishes of the Trump administration, and highlighting the unsettled debate within Europe on how to deal with China\u2019s globally expanding ambitions. That question is playing out in Europe with increased urgency amid an intense trade dispute between Beijing and Washington. The United States has depicted China as a rule-breaker intent on stealing technology, disrupting the international order and threatening nations\u2019 security with its next-generation telecommunications equipment. Much of Western Europe, too, has grown more cautious about Chinese investment, and earlier this month, the European Commission, in notably blunt language, described China as a \u201csystemic rival.\u201d China, with its Belt and Road Initiative \u2014 a vast multicontinent project of highways, rail lines and energy pipelines \u2014 has been trying to expand its reach closer to the heart of Europe. Other European Union countries, mostly in the continent\u2019s east, have already signed on to the project. However, diplomatic analysts say the involvement of Italy, a founding E.U. member, gives the project a particular boost of legitimacy. The deal would open the door for Chinese infrastructure investment in Italian ports, while making it easier for Beijing to gain influence and trade goods in Western Europe. Italian leaders have said they are simply doing what is economically prudent for their country, which is in the middle of its third recession in a decade. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said Italian companies will gain much-needed market access in China, and Conte said the deal with China does not jeopardize Italy\u2019s place in the euro-Atlantic alliance. \u201cA new Silk Road,\u201d Conte said, in a reference to the ancient trade routes that centuries ago helped to enrich Italian traders and foster a maritime empire around Venice. \u201cWe export a lot less than we import, compared with our European friends,\u201d said Licia Mattioli, vice president for international affairs at Confindustria, the main Italian industry association. \u201cSo we think there is a huge potential that we can exploit.\u201d Officials in Washington have warned that Italy is making a mistake and overlooking the downsides of doing business with Beijing. Criticism of the Belt and Road projects has been extensive. In some countries, the Chinese infrastructure projects have been beset by cost overruns. China helps to finance the projects, but in smaller countries, the setup can leave governments owing enormous sums to Beijing relative to their GDP. Above all, some experts are concerned China is building an infrastructure empire as a way to upend security and the economic world order. Garrett Marquis, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said earlier this month that the Italian government had no need to \u201clend legitimacy to China\u2019s infrastructure vanity project.\u201d In an usually blunt critique of an ally, the Security Council\u2019s official Twitter account also took aim at Italy, calling China\u2019s approach \u201cpredatory\u201d and saying the deal \u201cwill bring no benefits to the Italian people.\u201d The Italian government, composed of two anti-establishment parties, has shown a willingness over the past year to go its own way on major decisions. But Francesco Sisci, an Italian professor at People\u2019s University of China, said the timing of the decision \u2014 amid a trade war and growing E.U. debate about how to handle China \u2014 makes the move more fraught. \u201cItaly should have had extensive consultations with both the U.S. and Europe,\u201d said Sisci, who emphasized his views did not reflect those of his university in Beijing. \u201cNot to go in a way behind their backs.\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron has urged a more cautious approach to the Belt and Road Initiative, saying partner countries risked becoming \u201cvassal states.\u201d After leaving Italy, Xi is spending several more days in Europe, traveling first to Monaco and then to France, where he will meet with Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Both France and Germany have taken more guarded stances against China, but even they have not gone as far as the United States would like. The Trump administration has sought to convince European capitals to ban Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, from their 5G next-generation telecom networks, concerned that the company could use its technology for spying purposes. So far, however, U.S. warnings have gone largely unheeded. Merkel said Tuesday that she does not believe in excluding a company \u201csimply because it\u2019s from a certain country.\u201d Two weeks ago, Huawei opened a cybersecurity lab in Brussels, and the E.U. headquarters there will host an E.U.-China summit next month to be attended by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. Within Italy\u2019s government, one coalition member, the right-wing League, expressed more skepticism about the deal with China. The League\u2019s leader, Matteo Salvini, had said he would try to halt the deal if it looked like it might jeopardize national security. Massimiliano Romeo and Riccardo Molinari, two of the League\u2019s leaders in Parliament, issued a joint statement saying that, while it is important that Italian companies have the chance to grow, \u201cwhen national security and sovereignty are at stake, great prudence is required.\u201d \u201cWe are friends of everyone, nobody\u2019s colony,\u201d they said. Stefano Pitrelli contributed to this report.","37":"Now the Guatemalan Congress is considering a bill that would grant amnesty to perpetrators of crimes against humanity. It would free more than\u00a030 convicts, mostly former military officers, and invalidate current and future trials for crimes linked to the 1960-1996 war. The bill, which is expected to be back on Congress\u2019s agenda next week, has prompted outrage from Guatemalan civil society groups and organizations representing the indigenous, who make up 40\u00a0percent of the population but more than 80\u00a0percent of the victims of wartime abuses.\u00a0\u00a0 The measure has also alarmed the\u00a0United Nations and the U.S. government. Robert Palladino, deputy spokesman at the U.S. State Department, said last week that Washington was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the measure.\u00a0\u00a0 The legislative push comes as other Latin American countries are finally reckoning with the counterinsurgency tactics used by military forces against civilians during the Cold War. In Argentina, hundreds of human rights abusers have been convicted in the past 15 years. In El Salvador, where an amnesty law was struck down in 2016, 18 military officers are on trial for the massacre of nearly 1,000 people in\u00a0El Mozote in 1981 \u2014 one of the worst atrocities in Latin American history. In 2013, Guatemala became the first country to convict a former leader \u2014 ex-dictator\u00a0Efrain Rios Montt \u2014 of genocide. (His conviction was overturned on appeal, and he was being retried when he died last year.)\u00a0 But now, analysts say, there is a growing backlash against the trials of former wartime military officials and the\u00a0aggressive investigations of corruption by political, military and business elites in this impoverished country. Many of those corruption cases are being co-prosecuted by a pioneering U.N.-backed commission, which President Jimmy Morales is trying to shut down. The amnesty bill \u201cis part of a larger assault on the rule of law that is aimed at restoring the power of a corrupt elite\u201d in Guatemala, said\u00a0Jo-Marie Burt, a political scientist and Latin America specialist who teaches at George Mason University. The bill wending its way through Congress would amend the National Reconciliation Law, passed after the peace accords that ended the brutal war. That law includes an amnesty for many crimes \u2014 but not for torture, forced disappearance and crimes against humanity. The new bill would order the release within 24 hours of people imprisoned for those crimes committed during the armed conflict.\u00a0\u00a0 Rosalina Tuyuc, a longtime human rights activist, has been at the forefront of protests against the bill. After the killings of her father and husband by the military in the 1980s, Tuyuc founded the National Council of Widows, an indigenous-led human rights group. \u201cThey want to grant impunity for those responsible for forced disappearances, the rape of women and massacres,\u201d Tuyuc said in an interview. \u201cIt would be a step backward and an attack on a whole system of truth, justice and peace.\u201d Congressman Fernando Linares of the conservative National Advancement Party introduced the bill in 2017, but it did not make headway until last month, when it passed the first of three required votes. Linares said in an interview that the crimes excluded from the earlier amnesty did not exist in the country\u2019s criminal code during the conflict and should not be applied retroactively. He also said military officials should be tried in military tribunals. The bill\u2019s opponents say such arguments have been rejected by Guatemala\u2019s highest courts \u2014 and the legislation would violate international agreements the country has signed. \u201cThis is going back to another era where military governments or authoritarian regimes tried to grant themselves absolute impunity for atrocities they committed,\u201d said Daniel Wilkinson, managing director of the Americas division at Human Rights Watch. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that under international law.\u201d\u00a0 Among those who would be freed if the measure passes is former army chief of staff\u00a0Benedicto Lucas Garc\u00eda. He was sentenced to 58 years in prison last year for crimes against humanity, rape and forced disappearance. He is also facing trial for a case involving disappearances in connection with the remains of more than\u00a0500 people discovered in clandestine graves on a military base. At its core, the dispute over the bill is a dispute over what occurred during the conflict. According to the U.N.-backed truth commission, the military was responsible for more than 90 percent of civilian fatalities during the conflict. The commission also concluded that state forces carried out acts of genocide. Linares and other supporters of the bill reject those conclusions. The army\u2019s operations during the war \u201cwere a constitutional response to the armed actions of illegal groups,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Luis Quilo, a retired general and the president of the Association of Military Veterans of Guatemala. Proponents of the amnesty bill dismissed the State Department\u2019s statement, highlighting the fact that it was attributed to a deputy department spokesman. \u201cHe\u2019s a third-degree bureaucrat,\u201d Linares said.\u00a0 Human rights advocates view the amnesty bill as part of an effort to push back at Guatemala\u2019s groundbreaking campaign against corruption and impunity. Since 2007, hundreds of politicians, government employees, business executives and former military officers have been implicated in cases by the U.N.-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, or\u00a0CICIG, a team of lawyers and crime experts that supports Guatemalan prosecutors.\u00a0 President Morales has said he won\u2019t renew CICIG\u2019s two-year mandate when it ends in September. He has been in the commission\u2019s crosshairs over alleged campaign finance violations related to his 2015 election. He says he is innocent.\u00a0\u00a0","38":"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents took Sha Yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, better known as rapper 21 Savage, into custody early Sunday in Atlanta after a \u201ctargeted operation with federal and local law enforcement partners.\u201d  Though he is often touted as a local Atlanta rapper, ICE officials say he is actually \u201ca United Kingdom national\u201d and has overstayed his visa. \u201cMr. Abraham-Joseph initially entered the U.S. legally in July 2005, but subsequently failed to depart under the terms of his nonimmigrant visa and he became unlawfully present in the U.S. when his visa expired in July 2006,\u201d ICE spokesman Bryan Cox told The Washington Post in a statement. \u201cIn addition to being in violation of federal immigration law, Mr. Abraham-Joseph was convicted on felony drug charges in October 2014 in Fulton County, Georgia,\u201d the statement added. The rapper has been placed in \u201cremoval proceedings before the federal immigration courts,\u201d Cox said. \u201cICE will now await the outcome of his case before a federal immigration judge to determine future actions.\u201d  One of the rapper\u2019s lawyers, Charles H. Kuck, responded with a lengthy statement Monday night. Kuck did not confirm where the rapper is originally from but did state that he immigrated to the United States. \u201cAs a minor, his family overstayed their work visas, and he, like almost two million other children, was left without legal status through no fault of his own,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThis is a civil law violation, and the continued detention of Mr. Abraham-Joseph serves no other purpose than to unnecessarily punish him and try to intimidate him into giving up his right to fight to remain in the United States.\u201d  \u201cMr. Abraham-Joseph has never hid his immigration status from the US government. The Department of Homeland Security has known his address and his history since his filing for the U Visa in 2017, yet they took no action against him until this past weekend,\u201d Kuck added. \u201cICE can only continue to detain individuals who are a threat [to] the community or a flight risk to not show up at their hearings. . . . Mr. Abraham-Joseph is clearly not a danger to the community, and in fact, his contributions to local communities and schools that he grew up in are examples of the type of immigrant we want in America.\"  It was particularly strange that the arrest occurred hours before the Super Bowl, which is being hosted in Atlanta, and only days after the rapper performed there at the Bud Light Super Bowl Music Fest. 21 Savage is best known for his single \u201cBank Account\u201d as well as being featured on hit songs such as Post Malone\u2019s \u201cRockstar,\u201d Cardi B\u2019s \u201cBartier Cardi\u201d and Drake\u2019s \u201cSneakin'.\" His latest album, \u201cI Am > I Was,\u201d hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart in January. He is often praised as \u201cone of Atlanta\u2019s most promising rappers.\u201d  The charges came as a surprise to many fans, who long thought the rapper was from Georgia. He often spoke about a childhood spent bouncing around \u201cbeat-up . . . apartments\u201d in Atlanta. At the time of his arrest, the Wikipedia page for the rapper claimed he was born in Atlanta in 1992, where he \u201cwas raised by his mother, Heather, who is of Dominican origin and his four brothers and six sisters, though one is now deceased due to a shooting after a drug deal gone haywire.\u201d  Various profiles point to the rapper being \u201cexpelled from all DeKalb County schools for getting caught with a gun in the 7th grade.\u201d He told Fader in 2016, \u201cI probably broke the record for the youngest [person] to bring a gun to that school.\u201d  He also often spoke about \u201cgiving back\u201d to the Atlanta community. In August, he hosted his third annual \u201cIssa Back 2 School Drive\u201d to benefit students from DeKalb County Schools, which helps outfit children with uniforms and school supplies. \u201cI might rap about a lot of stuff, but that\u2019s just a reflection of what I\u2019ve been through,\u201d he said at the event. \u201cIn real life, everything I do, I want to bring everybody together. I want to give back to the community, help the kids, get them uniforms, books, book bags, everything they need \u2026 just do better. That\u2019s where it starts, the kids.\u201d  ICE, though, says he was born in the United Kingdom and entered the country in the summer of 2005. \u201cHis whole public persona is false. He actually came to the U.S. from the U.K. as a teen and overstayed his visa,\u201d an ICE spokesperson reportedly told CNN correspondent Nick Valencia.","39":"To state the obvious, the policy agenda of the Democratic Party has moved to the left. Ideas that used to be on the fringe \u2014 Medicare-for-all, guaranteed jobs and the Green New Deal, all financed by very progressive taxation \u2014 are now much more widely accepted by Democrats. Two possible theories explain this evolution: the old one from the center-left and the new one from the \u201cleftier\u201d left. The center left was\/is essentially friendly, and largely deferential, to markets. Left to their own devices, financial markets will efficiently allocate excess savings to their most productive uses \u2014 so over-regulation is dangerous. Same with globalization. Taxes should be progressive, but not too much so or you\u2019ll dampen private investment. Public borrowing crowds out private borrowing, so deficit reduction is an oft-stated goal. That sounds pretty Republican (or it did before Republicans went nuts). But there are two salient differences. One is that under center-left Democrats, you let the market rip, but you shave some gains off the top and redistribute them to those left behind, say through a robust Earned Income Tax Credit, the highly successful pro-work, anti-poverty wage subsidy that was expanded under President Bill Clinton. The second is that, in rare cases, it is kosher to tweak incentives to achieve a policy goal. A carbon tax to push back on climate change is a good example. Better yet, a cap-and-trade approach, in which the government sets up a market \u2014 there\u2019s that word again \u2014 wherein firms can trade pollution credits. The guiding principle is that the center-left policymaker has the technocratic skills to administer exactly the right tweaks and redistributions to ensure that markets continue to deliver optimal results. Though this position still describes some Democrats, it is no longer the dominant view, as economist Brad DeLong recently showed in a Vox interview. DeLong, who calls himself a \u201cRubin Democrat\u201d (a reference to Clinton\u2019s centrist treasury secretary, Bob Rubin), argues that the moment is such that \u201cThe baton rightly passes to our colleagues on our left. We are still here, but it is not our time to lead.\u201d \u201cDeLong believes,\u201d according to the piece, that \u201cthe time of people like him running the Democratic Party has passed.\u201d What changed to usher in this twilight of the technocrats? The limits of \u201cunfettered\u201d markets and under-regulated finance, and the risks of letting them rip, have become undeniably clear. Even before the finance-infused housing bubble delivered the Great Recession, market-driven inequalities soared to levels we hadn\u2019t seen since the 1920s. Then there\u2019s the fact that markets weren\u2019t really \u201cunfettered\u201d (ergo, the scare quotes). Though their center-left proponents argued otherwise, trade deals were not for \u201cfree\u201d trade. They were stacked to protect investors over workers and consumers (as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) argued regarding the Trans-Pacific Partnership). Center-left policymakers didn\u2019t just leave financial markets alone; they actively deregulated them (see the repeal of Glass-Steagall banking regulations supported by Clinton in 1999). And when the labor unions came knocking for political support, the center-left too often wouldn\u2019t open the door (see the lack of support among moderate Democrats for the Employee Free Choice Act). Next, center-left policies appeared insufficient to meet the challenges Democrats increasingly cared about, such as growing inequality, inaccessible health care, the cost of college, climate change, retirement insecurity and institutionalized racism. DeLong argues, with merit, that many of the center-left policies never got a chance because they depended on \u201ca responsible center-right partner to succeed,\u201d and such support was never even close to forthcoming. But as with the trade deals, the problem wasn\u2019t just political. Where center-left Democrats touted the need for \u201ctough choices\u201d on Social Security and Medicare (by which they meant, in part, cuts to benefits), the left wing of the party wanted to expand the programs, as is seen in today\u2019s prioritization of Social Security expansion and Medicare-for-all. For all these reasons, this twilight of technocrats makes sense to me. But it raises the question: What\u2019s up in the morning? If the old left\u2019s theory has been proved wrong, what is its replacement? The Democratic left\u2019s new theory of the case is still forming, but it looks something like this: Both parties have stood by while markets were rigged, and therefore, they \u2014 both markets and the old parties \u2014 cannot be counted on to solve the challenges listed above. We must de-rig them through antitrust action, robust labor standards, union power (as a counterbalance to capital\u2019s power) and trade deals that are handshakes between workers across borders, not investors. At the same time, we can very progressively tax accumulated wealth and use the proceeds to both provide opportunities for those who have been left behind and fight existential market failures \u2014 most importantly, climate change. What does the cast-aside technocrat have to say about that? The knee-jerk response is that such intervention into the market pushes too far and will kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. But this response is unconvincing. Social democracies have long existed (e.g., Scandinavian countries) that go much further to protect their citizens and their environment, spending 10 percentage points more of their GDP through the public sector ($2.1 trillion a year, in our economy) than we do without paying a productivity price for it. Obviously, universal health coverage is achievable, as it exists in every other advanced economy, at a cost of 6 to 8 percent of GDP less than we spend. The fact is, while opponents scream about the massive negative market responses to the progressive agenda \u2014 People will stop working! Investors will stop investing! Doctors won\u2019t take patients! \u2014 we don\u2019t know either what the actual agenda will look like, if it will ever get legislated, or, if it does, what its impact will be on the zillions of moving parts in our economy. All we know is that in some fundamentally important ways, what we\u2019ve been doing hasn\u2019t worked. DeLong\u2019s right. It\u2019s time to pass the baton.","40":"With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0Ralph Northam has a lot of reading to do. Virginia\u2019s Democratic governor declared this weekend that he\u2019s \u201cnot going anywhere.\u201d Refusing to resign, the 59-year-old promised to pursue racial equality during the final three years of his term. After the revelation of a racist picture on his medical school yearbook page and his confession that he wore blackface during a moonwalking contest in 1984, Northam said he\u2019s begun to finally grapple with the meaning of \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d He\u2019s planning a \u201creconciliation tour\u201d that will take him across the state and has ordered all his Cabinet secretaries to prepare policy proposals that would improve the plight of African Americans. There are certainly models for redemption. John McCain\u2019s career was nearly destroyed by the Keating Five scandal, for example, but the late senator from Arizona\u00a0refashioned himself as a champion for strict campaign finance rules. First, however, Northam says he wants to read up on race. He told The Washington Post that he has reviewed \u201cThe Case for Reparations,\u201d a 2014 article in the Atlantic by Ta-Nehisi Coates, as well as a few chapters from \u201cRoots,\u201d by Alex Haley. \u201cI have a lot more to learn,\u201d Northam told my colleague Greg Schneider on Saturday. \u201cThe more I know, the more I can do.\u201d First lady Pam Northam, who has urged her husband to remain in office, is also tackling the subject. She\u2019s reading \u201cWe Face the Dawn,\u201d by Margaret Edds, which tells the story of two Virginia lawyers who were involved in Brown v. Board of Education. -- \u201cRoots\u201d is famous because ABC adapted the novel into a television miniseries in 1977, but it is a work of fiction. There are vastly better books to learn about the true history of race in America. I reached out on Sunday to some of the nation\u2019s preeminent historians to ask if they would recommend a title or two for Northam. Several happen to live in the commonwealth. More than a dozen scholars sent suggestions for what the governor should be reading. Taken together, their inspired ideas form quite a strong syllabus for Northam to start his remedial studies. \u201cVirginia\u2019s history has inspired some of the most powerful and searching works in the history of the United States,\u201d said Edward Ayers, the president emeritus of the University of Richmond. \u201cHistorians have evoked, at a human scale and with careful research, every era from the two-and-a-half centuries of slavery through the Civil War and Reconstruction, into the generations of Jim Crow and disfranchisement, into the struggles of the 20th and 21st centuries. I think that grounding his understanding in particular Virginia places is the best way to begin to comprehend a history heartbreaking in its cruelty and inspiring in the resilience of those who were wronged.\u201d Ayers, who won the 2004 Bancroft Prize for \u201cIn the Presence of Mine Enemies,\u201d an extraordinary narrative of the Civil War, recommends that Northam begin with Edmund Morgan\u2019s \u201cAmerican Slavery, American Freedom: The Ordeal of Colonial Virginia,\u201d which came out in 1975.  If Northam wants to learn about how slavery evolved during the 17th century on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, where he grew up, Ayers thinks the governor should look to \u201cMyne Owne Ground,\u201d by Timothy Breen and Stephen Innes. \u201cReading firsthand testimony from the narrative of Oloudah Equiano, an African man enslaved in Virginia, and from Thomas Jefferson\u2019s \u2018Notes on the State of Virginia,\u2019 where he tries to explain away racial subjugation through the language of science, would be eye-opening,\u201d Ayers added. For a glimpse at the slave trade that ravaged families only a few hundred yards from the Virginia State Capitol, Ayers suggests \u201cSlaves Waiting for Sale,\u201d by Maurie McInnis. For an understanding of Richmond itself, the professor floats Gregg Kimball\u2019s \u201cAmerican City, Southern Place: A Cultural History of Antebellum Richmond.\u201d During the period between the Revolution and the Civil War, Virginia became the largest slave state and the state that saw the largest numbers of families devastated by the domestic slave trade. To understand that awful chapter, Ayers recommends Northam looks at \u201cLife in Black and White,\u201d which focuses on Northern Virginia, by Brenda Stevenson. He also suggests \u201cThe Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family,\u201d by Annette Gordon-Reed. The Virginia State Capitol has been reeling for more than a week now. (Katherine Frey\/The Washington Post) -- Gordon-Reed, a Harvard historian who earned the Pulitzer Prize in 2009 for \u201cThe Hemingses,\u201d suggests a book by Philip Morgan that might appeal to Northam: \u201cSlave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake & Lowcountry.\u201d She also recommends \u201cThe Captive\u2019s Quest for Freedom\u201d about the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, by Richard Blackett, and \u201cThe Internal Enemy: Slavery and War in Virginia, 1772-1832,\u201d by Alan Taylor. -- Taylor, a historian at the University of Virginia who received the 2014 Pulitzer for \u201cThe Internal Enemy,\u201d recommends\u00a0that Northam read Coates's full-length book \u201cWe Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy,\u201d\u00a0in addition to his magazine piece.\u00a0Taylor also offered Edmund Morgan's \u201cAmerican Slavery, American Freedom\u201d and\u00a0\u201cWhite Over Black: American Attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550-1812,\u201d by Winthrop Jordan. -- \u201cHe has to start with W.E.B. DuBois\u2019s \u2018The Souls of Black Folk,\u2019\u201d said Columbia University historian Eric Foner, who received the Pulitzer in 2011 for \u201cThe Fiery Trial,\u201d which tracks Abraham Lincoln\u2019s evolving views on slavery. Foner also suggested Michael Honey\u2019s recent book on Martin Luther King Jr., which \u201cgives us a much better picture of the man and his ideas than the sanitized King trotted out on MLK Day,\u201d and David Blight\u2019s \u201cProphet of Freedom,\u201d a biography of Frederick Douglass published last fall. -- New York University professor Steven Hahn, who won the 2004 Pulitzer for \u201cA Nation Under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South From Slavery to the Great Migration,\u201d named an older book by Blight, \u201cRace and Reunion,\u201d which explored the Civil War in America\u2019s collective memory. He also suggested \u201cThe Strange Career of Jim Crow,\u201d the C. Vann Woodward classic. \u201cIf anyone doubts how deep racism is in the country's DNA,\u201d Hahn said, \u201cNortham, Herring and [Eastern Virginia Medical School] have shown us.\u201d -- Caroline Janney, who runs the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Civil War History, recommends Northam begin with Robert Penn Warren\u2019s \u201cLegacy of the Civil War.\u201d \u201cIt was written for the centennial of the war amid the civil rights movement,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is an excellent, short\u00a0place to start to understand the long arm of not only the war, but the tangled and complicated history of race and memory of slavery in the United States.\u201d She also suggested \u201cMaking Whiteness,\u201d by Grace Hale, a colleague at U-Va. Ralph Northam talks about the history of the Governor's Mansion as he shows guests around on Saturday. (Katherine Frey\/The Washington Post) -- The governor inadvertently underscored just how limited his starting knowledge of racial history is when he sat down with CBS. Gayle King started their interview with this open-ended question: \u201cWhere would you like to begin?\u201d Northam replied: \u201cWe are now at the 400-year anniversary \u2014 just 90 miles from here in 1619 \u2014\u00a0the first indentured servants from Africa landed on our shores.\u201d The host interjected. \u201cAlso known as slavery,\u201d she said. \u201cYes,\u201d the governor replied. \u201cThe first Africans brought to Virginia were captured in Angola and brought in a slave ship, but Virginia did not have a formal legal system for slavery in 1619,\u201d Fenit Nirappil explains. \u201cThere appears to be some ambiguity over their legal status, with some still forced to work for life while others had a path to freedom, according to the National Park Service. Asked to clarify Northam\u2019s remarks, a spokeswoman for the governor pointed to news accounts that said Africans were treated as indentured servants before slave laws were written.\u201d -- After watching Northam\u2019s interview, U-Va.\u00a0historian Sarah Milov said two books came to mind that might help set him straight. In \u201cSaltwater Slavery,\u201d Stephanie Smallwood writes about the physical processes of enslavement \u2014 and the social dislocation it caused \u2014 from the Middle Passage to the Americas. \u201cGov. Northam would be unlikely to mistake slavery for indentured servitude after reading this book, which notes how Virginia decisively turned away from English indentured servants toward African captives in the late 17th century,\u201d she emailed. Milov was also struck by Northam\u2019s rationale for refusing to resign. The governor emphasized that he was a doctor in the Army and a pediatric neurologist in Norfolk as a civilian. \u201cRight now, Virginia needs someone that can heal,\u201d Northam said on CBS. \u201cThere\u2019s no better person to do that than a doctor.\u201d She thinks Northam ought to read \u201cMedical Bondage: Race, Gender and the Origins of Gynecology,\u201d by Deirdre Cooper Owens. \u201cThis book might help Dr. Northam better understand the history of medical experimentation on enslaved black women, including by the \u2018father of modern gynecology,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps the governor might see the irony in his claim \u2026 that \u2018nobody better than a doctor to heal the wound.\u2019\u201d Justene Hill Edwards, another historian at U-Va., suggests \u201cThe Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class,\u201d by David Roediger, and \u201cRacecraft: The Soul of Inequality in American Life,\u201d by Karen Fields and Barbara Fields. -- \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to me that a white Democratic politician from a Southern state in the year 2019 \u2014 one who depends on massive turnout and political organization from black Virginians \u2014 was so in need of remedial education that he didn\u2019t know what Roots was all about,\u201d said Cornell University\u2019s Ed Baptist, the author of \u201cThe Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism.\u201d Baptist\u2019s book focuses more on the internal slave trade than the importation of slaves from Africa, and he shows how the transportation of enslaved people from Virginia and Maryland fueled the cotton plantation economy of the Deep South. Baptist, who grew up in North Carolina, recommended three readable books by academic historians so he could understand how slavery shaped the United States, whites\u2019 dependence on it and black resistance to it: \u201cThey Were Her Property,\u201d by Stephanie Jones-Rogers; \u201cCloser to Freedom: Enslaved Women and Everyday Resistance,\u201d by Stephanie Camp; and \u201cThe Price for Their Pound of Flesh,\u201d by Daina Ramey Berry. Baptist also suggested three other non-historical accounts: Jesmyn Ward\u2019s novel \u201cSing, Unburied, Sing\u201d; Kiese Laymon\u2019s memoir \u201cHeavy\u201d; and Tressie McMillan Cottom\u2019s \u201cThick,\u201d a new book of essays published last month about the impact of racism on black women\u2019s bodies in contemporary America.\u00a0Cottom is a sociologist at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. -- Former Spelman University president Beverly Daniel Tatum wrote the classic \u201cWhy Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria,\u201d which poignantly explores the psychology of racism. She recommends \u201cWhite Fragility,\u201d by Robin DiAngelo, which Tatum said \u201caddresses why it is so hard for white adults to recognize their own complicity in the perpetuation of racism.\u201d\u00a0To better understand racial history as it relates to the current political moment, she also thinks Northam needs to read \u201cWhite Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide,\u201d by Carol Anderson, and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Original Sin: Racism, White Privilege, and the Bridge to a New America,\u201d by Jim Wallis. Tatum also suggests \u201cStamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America,\u201d by Ibram X. Kendi, who directs American University\u2019s Antiracist Research and Policy Center. \u201cSo many to choose from,\u201d said Tatum. \u201cI hope he does read some of these!\u201d Justin Fairfax presides over a session of the Virginia Senate in Richmond on Friday. (Steve Helber\/AP) THE LATEST FROM RICHMOND:  -- Pressure on Northam to resign has eased somewhat because of the two sexual assault allegations that have been leveled against the man who would replace him. \u201cVirginia Democratic lawmakers began circulating a draft resolution Sunday to begin impeachment proceedings against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D),\u201d Nirappil reports. \u201cFairfax has fended off calls from the state Democratic Party and some state and national lawmakers to resign after Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson publicly came forward last week to accuse him of sexual assault. Tyson accused Fairfax of sexually assaulting her in 2004, at the Democratic National Convention in Boston. Watson on Friday accused Fairfax of assaulting her in 2000, while they were students at Duke University. Fairfax says the encounters were consensual \u2026 and wants the FBI or others to investigate the accusations. \u2026 \u201cA vote on the resolution, which could come as soon as Tuesday if it is introduced Monday, would direct the House Committee for Courts of Justice to hold hearings on the allegations against Fairfax, with the support of legislative staff and state agencies. Such an investigation would be the precursor to a committee recommendation for impeachment and a vote of the full House. An attempt to impeach Fairfax appears unprecedented; there has been no attempt to impeach an elected official in the state in modern times \u2026 Tyson and Watson, who have separate legal representation, have indicated through their lawyers that they are willing to testify during impeachment proceedings.\u201d -- Democrats are struggling to find a path out of the political mess, Amy Gardner and Jenna Portnoy report from Richmond for today\u2019s newspaper: \u201cAs a group, Virginia Democrats have publicly embraced their party\u2019s zero tolerance for racism and sexual violence. \u2026 But privately, Democrats are divided, particularly about whether ousting Northam is best for their party. Some want to talk about how far Virginia has come from its painful, racist past. Others are uncomfortable about offering redemption to the two white men but not the African American man, who has vehemently denied the allegations. No one seems to know how to live by the rules their party has set on race and gender, or how to take the first step toward whatever comes next. \u2026 \u201cDemocratic leaders have urged their colleagues not to talk about the scandals, and most lawmakers declined to speak on the record. \u2026 Several white lawmakers said privately that discussing the racial elements of the controversy is particularly tricky because no one feels comfortable forgiving behavior that African American lawmakers have condemned. \u2026 Black lawmakers have been particularly tight-lipped, holding long, closed-door meetings since the scandals began and leaving others to speculate that they, too, might be divided. Some white Democrats said they were surprised when the Legislative Black Caucus issued a statement late Thursday sticking with its earlier call for Northam\u2019s resignation. \u2026 \u201cSeveral Democrats said it will be up to the state\u2019s two Democratic U.S. senators, Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine \u2014 the closest thing the party has to senior statesmen \u2014 to find a way forward. Both senators sent senior aides to Richmond last week to try to calm lawmakers and put the scandals into perspective. But publicly, they have offered minimal input beyond their written statements. After a second Fairfax accuser came forward Friday, the two offered differing opinions, with Kaine demanding Fairfax\u2019s resignation and Warner saying only that he should go \u2018if\u2019 the allegations are true. Warner\u2019s caution may derive from his own political challenges; he faces reelection next year.\u201d -- \u201cVirginia is a state that for historical reasons has always imagined its political institutions and leaders as possessed of special virtue. Now they are known for uncommon vice,\u201d observes Politico editor in chief John Harris, who cut his teeth covering Richmond for The Post in the late 1980s. \u201cThe current era of politics, prone to media storms of the sort that threaten to swamp Northam and Fairfax, is especially hostile to heroic myths. But the shock of exposure is greater when\u2014in contrast to more \u2026 obviously roguish politicians like Donald Trump\u2014the disreputable behavior was obscured by a solemn fa\u00e7ade. \u2026 \u201cMake no mistake: Virginia does indeed have a not-so-distant past steeped in systemic racial discrimination. But as writers like Frank B. Atkinson (who wrote the political history, \u2018The Dynamic Dominion\u2019) make clear, for the most part in the 20th century did not devolve into open racial warfare of the sort that took place in Mississippi, Alabama and other parts of the Deep South, and which later migrated to major cities of the North. The face of discrimination in Virginia\u2014where leaders in the 1950s and beyond engaged in \u2018massive resistance\u2019 to avoid integrating the schools after the Supreme Court\u2019s Brown decision\u2014was more typically understated and shrouded in respectability. It came dressed in the well-starched suits of court house lawyers and pols for the Byrd Machine, which dominated state politics for decades, not the gaudy robes of Klansman. Respectable establishment racism, of course, is no better and arguably worse than more flamboyant other kinds.\u201d -- Welcome aboard: Mariana Alfaro joins The Daily 202 team this morning as an overnight researcher.

Despite featuring power people like Michelle Obama and Lady Gaga, this year's Grammys were defined by a long list of no-shows\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including rap star Childish Gambino\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who feel\u00a0their sound has historically been undervalued by the people who pick the winners. Chris Richards reports: \u201cThe first glaring absence on Sunday night came during the presentation of song of the year, one of the most prestigious little gramophones in the bunch. The award went to 'This Is America' by Childish Gambino\u00a0\u2026 but he wasn\u2019t there to collect his prize. ...\u00a0Despite leading the pack with the most nominations, Kendrick Lamar and Drake also declined respective invitations to perform on Sunday night. ... Rap remains the dominant pop idiom of the 21st century, but OutKast is the only rap act to have ever won album of the year, the most prestigious of all Grammys \u2014 and that happened way back in 2004. Fifteen years later, who could blame rap\u2019s brightest lights for staying away from the microphone? \u2018This Is America\u2019 was the first rap tune to win song of the year. Ever. (Later, it won record of the year, too. Also a first.)\u201d Here is the complete list of winners. Rep. Walter Jones\u00a0died Sunday on his 76th birthday. (Andrew Harnik\/AP) GET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b SHUTDOWN WATCH: -- The risk of a second government shutdown at the end of the week increased significantly after bipartisan negotiations fell apart.\u00a0Erica Werner, Damian Paletta and Seung Min Kim report: \u201cTrump\u2019s border wall demands, which precipitated the record-long 35-day shutdown that ended late last month, were a secondary issue in the impasse that developed over the weekend, according to officials in both parties. Instead, after looking promising for days, the delicate negotiations collapsed over Democrats\u2019 insistence on limiting the number of unauthorized immigrants who can be detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The breakdown in talks made it unlikely that lawmakers will be able to finalize an agreement on Monday, as they\u2019d hope to do so it could pass the House and Senate before Friday night\u2019s deadline. \u2026 \u201cThe stalemate left the path to keeping the government open unclear. There were behind-the-scenes efforts late Sunday to salvage the talks, but it was uncertain whether they would be successful. \u2026 Another funding lapse could affect many Americans within days because one of the agencies that would go unfunded during the shutdown is the Internal Revenue Service \u2026 Lawmakers on the 17-member conference committee had been trading offers over how much money could go to barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. They were looking at between $1.3 billion and $2 billion \u2014 far short of the $5.7 billion Trump had demanded. \u2026 But throughout the talks, Democrats had also been focused on limiting ICE\u2019s ability to detain unauthorized immigrants, which has become a major issue for the party because of Democrats\u2019 opposition to the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive detention tactics.\u201d -- Key lawmakers plan to meet Monday afternoon in a late-stage bid to revive talks, per Erica and Damian: \u201cHouse Appropriations Committee Chairman Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.), Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), Rep. Kay Granger (R-Tex.) and Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) will attend the meeting, two congressional aides said.\u201d --\u00a0Pentagon officials met over the weekend to decide which Army Corps of Engineers projects could be \u201ctapped for money\u201d\u00a0in case the president declares a state of emergency to build the wall.\u00a0The New York Times's Emily Cochrane, Maggie Haberman and Eric Schmitt report: \u201cOne proposal circulating among some WH officials, including those close to Stephen Miller, the president\u2019s top domestic policy adviser, is to claim that the wall would be built to protect the more than 5,000 active-duty troops now operating near the southwestern border.\u201d -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) will pull around 360 National Guard troops from the state\u2019s border with Mexico days after Trump labeled Central American refugees and migrants traveling there a \u201cnational security crisis.\u201d From the Los Angeles Times\u2019s Jazmine Ulloa and Taryn Luna: \u201cThe announcement comes just one day before the governor delivers his first State of the State address \u2026 setting the stage for Newsom to counter Trump\u2019s State of the Union address ... Newsom says he is giving the National Guard a new mission so that troops would not take part in the White House\u2019s \u2018political theater\u2019 and instead \u2018refocus on the real threats facing our state.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018The Border \u201cemergency\u201d is a manufactured crisis,\u2019 Newsom is expected to say Tuesday \u2026 \u2018This is our answer to the White House: No more division, xenophobia or nativism.\u2019\u201d -- Workers harmed by the last shutdown\u00a0are dreading the damage another one could cause.\u00a0Vicki Ibarra, for example, needed to go thousands of dollars in debt after working at the IRS for 16 years. Eli Saslow and Jabin Botsford tell\u00a0her story: \u201cIbarra, 45, had built her adult life on the principle of self-sufficiency \u2014 raising two children by herself, adopting her teenage niece, devoting her career to a government job because it promised meaningful work and 9-to-5 dependability. The salary was modest at about $35,000 a year, so she often stayed late to work overtime. ...\u00a0Even if she sometimes needed an extension on her rent, she\u2019d spent 25 years in the same two-bedroom house, where a small sign was posted on a bedroom wall: \u2018Get up and go get it!\u2019\u00a0That was the person she had been right up until the government shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Dec. 22, forcing her to miss one paycheck and then another, leaving her with no income for the first time since she turned 18.\u201d\u00a0 -- The threat of another shutdown has left some wondering whether more airports should turn to private contractors rather than TSA for security. Lori Aratani reports: \u201cAlthough the private screeners are contractors, they were paid during the shutdown when other government contractors were not because they were considered essential personnel, and failure to pay them would have violated their contract. Evaluations of the two programs by outside firms hired by the TSA have found no significant differences between the two systems \u2014 either in cost or the ability to move passengers through checkpoints, TSA officials said. However, studies by the Government Accountability Office note that in some instances private contractors\u2019 costs were 2 percent to 19 percent lower than the TSA\u2019s estimates of its costs for the same work.\u201d 2020 WATCH: -- Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar became the latest Democrat to enter the 2020 presidential field. Chelsea Janes and Matt Viser report: \u201cKlobuchar held her rally at a park on the banks of the Mississippi River, near the site of the 2007 collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge, in which 13 people were killed and scores were injured. The bridge was quickly rebuilt in 2008, after politicians and officials, including the senator, came together to expedite the construction process. The intended takeaway of its role as the emotional heart of her speech: Klobuchar is someone who will get things done. \u2018That sense of community is fracturing across our nation right now, worn down by the petty and vicious nature of our politics. We are all tired of the shutdowns and the showdowns, the gridlock and the grandstanding,\u2019 Klobuchar said.\u201d Klobuchar\u2019s \u201centry into the race came at an outside event at which the bareheaded candidate, her introductory speakers and hundreds of supporters were pelted by relentless snow. She sought to use that, too, as defining her candidacy. \u2018We don\u2019t let a little snow stop us! We don\u2019t let a lot of cold stop us!\u2019 Klobuchar said as she started her speech.\u201d -- But stories about Klobuchar being a bad boss\u00a0have cast a pall over her campaign launch. Politico\u2019s Elena Schneider reports: \u201cKlobuchar\u2019s campaign released statements saying she \u2018loves her staff,\u2019 citing aides who have \u2018been with her for years.\u2019 But Klobuchar\u2019s campaign has not denied any of the specific allegations detailed in recent news stories, and Democrats in the first caucus state of Iowa \u2014 where Klobuchar hopes to make a splash in a crowded 2020 field \u2014 have said the senator\u2019s treatment of staff has the potential to sideswipe her campaign.\u201d -- Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet implied he may enter the crowded 2020 field. Robert Costa reports: \u201c\u2018We\u2019ve got a million people that are going to run, which I think is great,\u2019 Bennet (Colo.) said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u2018Meet the Press.\u2019 But, he added, \u2018I think having one more voice in that conversation that\u2019s focused on America\u2019s future, I don\u2019t think would hurt.\u2019 Bennet, 54, cast himself as a centrist Democrat who would bring business and managerial experience to the crowded field, should he decide to run. \u2026 \u2018I\u2019ve got a different set of experiences than the other folks in the race, many of whom are my friends and people that I like,\u2019 Bennet said.\u201d -- Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a critic of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.),\u00a0is also thinking about joining the field.\u00a0Moulton told BuzzFeed News that, although he is not definitely running, he is taking a \u201cvery serious look at it. Because I believe it's time for a new generation of leadership, and we gotta send Donald Trump packing.\u201d\u00a0 -- Taking her first direct shot at Trump since she formally launched her campaign, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said the president \u201cmay not even be a free person\u201d in 2020. David Weigel and Felicia Sonmez report: \u201cWarren had not previously hinted that the scandals surrounding the president could keep him from seeking a second term. On her previous trip to Iowa, she rarely mentioned Trump by name. But her campaign, which has faced more direct attacks from Trump than other Democratic candidates, appears to see the question about Trump\u2019s own viability as way to stop engaging with everything he says. Asked to expand on her comments later in the day, Warren quipped: \u2018Come on, how many investigations are there now? It\u2019s no longer just the Mueller investigation, they\u2019re everywhere. And these are serious investigations.\u2019\u201d -- The\u00a0controversies in Virginia and those surrounding Warren\u2019s 2020 campaign rollout have one thing in common: They've highlighted how much the national discourse is influenced by identity politics. Matt Viser and Sean Sullivan report: \u201cDemocrats are engaged in a vigorous debate over how to talk about identity politics at a time when the country\u2019s growing diversity is scrambling the electoral map, and as a diverse field is gathering to run for president.\u00a0President Trump engaged in his own brand of identity politics before his White House tenure, tapping into white grievance and exploiting racial tensions as a political weapon against nonwhites. ... Amid the tumult resulting from the two distinct but simultaneous controversies, some see a hard-earned benefit: a more frank discussion of the nation\u2019s past.\u201d\u00a0 -- Steve Schmidt, a former senior strategist for John McCain\u2019s 2008 campaign who is now advising Howard Schultz, stormed out of an interview for his\u00a0own podcast after a co-host pressed him on the former Starbucks CEO\u2019s independent bid. The Daily Beast\u2019s Eleanor Clift reports: \u201cElise Jordan, an alumnus of the George W. Bush White House and the Rand Paul presidential campaign, outlined the ground rules that everything would be on the record, and that Schmidt would be treated no differently than any other guest even though he was a founder of Words Matter, along with Jordan and [Adam] Levine, another Bush veteran\u00a0\u2026 Schmidt railed at having to defend himself on his podcast with a stream of curses a source present in the studio said consumed six minutes. \u2026 \u2018Steve, you\u2019ve got to answer the questions,\u2019 Levine says. \u2018I\u2019m not,\u2019 and with that Schmidt slams down his headset and abruptly ends the interview. He threatened legal action against the studio if the interview airs, according to a source involved in the discussion. When his legal threat failed, he offered to buy the recording, according to the source. The studio refused.\u201d THERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Michael Sanchez \u2014 the brother of Lauren Sanchez, who was having an extramarital affair with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos \u2014 supplied their text messages to the National\u00a0Enquirer, according to the Daily Beast\u2019s Lachlan Markay. \u201cStill unresolved: why Sanchez allegedly supplied the information to the Enquirer; why the Enquirer promoted a story about Bezos with such vigor; [and] what, if anything this had to do with the Enquirer\u2019s long-standing support for Trump \u2026 [Documents] show that Michael Sanchez believed the Enquirer pursued its story about Bezos with \u2018President Trump's knowledge and appreciation\u2019\u2014a chase encouraged, in Sanchez\u2019s estimation, by Republican operatives \u2018who THINK Jeff gets up every morning and has a WaPo meeting to plot its next diabolical attack on President Trump.\u2019\u201d -- An attorney for David Pecker, the CEO of American Media Inc., denied that the company\u2019s National Enquirer attempted to extort Bezos, who owns The Washington Post.\u00a0Amy B Wang reports: \u201c\u2018It absolutely is not extortion and not blackmail,\u2019 [attorney Elkan] Abramowitz told \u2018This Week\u2019 host George Stephanopoulos. Instead, Abramowitz insisted, what AMI was doing was journalism. He also suggested that it was Bezos who threatened the tabloid by insinuating its moves were somehow being directed by Saudi Arabia. \u2026 [Stephanopoulos asked,] \u2018If you believe the photos are newsworthy, how is it journalism to say we\u2019re not going to publish this if you give us something we want?\u2019 Abramowitz argued that the story of Bezos\u2019s affair with Sanchez was already \u2018out there.\u2019 \u2026 ABC chief legal analyst Dan Abrams disagreed later on the show, noting AMI was threatening to publish photos that had not yet been released. Whether that constituted legal blackmail or extortion was less clear.\u201d -- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said his panel intends to investigate Trump\u2019s long-standing business ties to Deutsche Bank, which has been implicated in Russian money laundering. Greg Miller reports: \u201c\u2018We are not interested in our committee in whether he\u2019s a tax cheat or not worth what he says he is,\u2019 [Schiff] said in an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u2018Meet the Press.\u2019 \u2018What we are interested in is, does the president have business dealings with Russia such that it compromises the United States?\u2019 \u2026 Schiff voiced concern that [special counsel Bob] Mueller has shied away from investigating Trump\u2019s ties to the German lender, saying that \u2018if the special counsel hasn\u2019t subpoenaed Deutsche Bank, he can\u2019t be doing much of a money laundering investigation.\u2019\u201d -- Comments made last week\u00a0by one of Mueller's lead prosecutors during a closed-door hearing seem to suggest that people in Trump's orbit considered offering Moscow relief from some U.S. sanctions and sought to end a\u00a0conflict sparked by Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine. By the New York Times\u2019s Sharon LaFraniere, Kenneth P. Vogel and Scott Shane:\u00a0\u201cThe theory was offered almost as an aside by the prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann, during a discussion of contacts between Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and a longtime Russian associate, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, whom investigators have linked to Russian intelligence. ... Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik repeatedly communicated about a so-called peace plan for Ukraine starting in early August 2016, while Mr. Manafort was still running Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, and continuing into 2018, months after Mr. Manafort had been charged by the special counsel\u2019s office with a litany of crimes related to his work in the country.\u201d\u00a0 -- The wife of Putin's spokesman faces U.S. tax\u00a0questions. Tatiana Navka, a former Olympic champion, might have failed to declare her true income and may owe\u00a0unpaid property tax. By the Guardian's Luke Harding and Jon Swaine: Navka \u201cappears to have wrongly claimed a potentially beneficial US tax status, according to an investigation by the Guardian. Court papers suggest she separately built up tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid property taxes on a house she told US authorities she had already sold. Navka\u00a0lived and trained in the US for more than a decade. ...\u00a0Navka declined to answer specific questions from the Guardian about her US tax affairs. She said: \u2018In your previous newspaper article you didn\u2019t use my answers and commentary, which I sent. Apparently, your newspaper doesn\u2019t strive for objectivity.

The film told the story of the NFL's attempts to discredit research tying brain damage to football, and Bob Costas wanted to address it on national television. \u2026 Costas sent the essay to his bosses for approval, something he typically did not do -- and waited. What would ensue that week -- and in the years that followed -- reveals for the first time how a broadcasting icon went from fronting America's most popular sport to being excised from last year's Super Bowl and, ultimately, ending his nearly 40-year career with NBC.\u201d -- New York Times, \u201cA Princess Vanishes. A Video Offers Alarming Clues,\u201d by Vivian Yee: \u201cThe princess known as Sheikha Latifa had not left Dubai, the glittering emirate ruled by her father, in 18 years. \u2026 Her escape \u2014 planned over several years with the help of a Finnish capoeira trainer and a self-proclaimed French ex-spy \u2014 lasted less than a week. Within a few days of setting sail on the Indian Ocean in the Frenchman\u2019s yacht, bound for India and then the United States, the sheikha went silent. She has not been seen since, except in a few photos released in December by her family, which says she is safely home after surviving what they said was a kidnapping. Yet thanks to the video she made before fleeing, her face and voice have made their way around the world, drawing more than two million views on YouTube, spurring avid news coverage and marring Dubai\u2019s image as a world capital of glitz and commerce.\u201d -- Wall Street Journal, \u201cPolitics Is a Dirty Business\u2014Starting with the Rats at Los Angeles City Hall,\u201d by Ian Lovett:\u00a0\u201cPublic servants arrive some mornings to find tiny paw prints, nibbled plants, even droppings and puddles on their desks.

The \u2018Baby Trump Does El Paso\u2019 GoFundMe page had $4,086 as of Friday, easily meeting a $3,500 goal. Extra funds will be donated to the Annunciation House in El Paso, a nonprofit that provides support to immigrants.

Perry Stein reports: \u201cSince January, he has led a school system of about 49,000 students while trying to gain public support for his nomination, striving to show residents he is the right educator for the job. For Ferebee, who never worked for the D.C. school system before becoming the most powerful man in it, that means guarding any agenda he may \u2014 or may not \u2014 have.

(Jose Luis Gonzalez\/Reuters) With Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0Joshua Trump, a sixth-grader from Delaware, has been bullied because he shares a last name with the president. \u201cThey curse at him, they call him an idiot, they call him stupid,\u201d his mother, Megan Trump Berto, told a local TV station last year. Yakelin Garcia Contreras, from Guatemala, was the same age as Joshua, 11, when she was separated from her mother last year after they arrived at the southern border to seek asylum. \u201cWe fled our homes seeking protection from violence and a better life for my daughter,\u201d said Albertina Contreras Telator, her mother, who got her back after two months apart. \u201cThe treatment we were met with was horrifying.\u201d Joshua will be President Trump\u2019s guest during tonight\u2019s State of the Union. He\u2019ll be seated in the first lady\u2019s box, the White House announced late Monday. Yakelin will be the guest of Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who helped draw public attention to the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy last June at a time when the White House was denying the very existence of such a policy. Merkley is now seriously considering a run for president. \u201cWe need to bear witness to the suffering that this cruel policy inflicted and resolve to make sure that nothing like this ever happens in the United States of America again,\u201d the senator said, explaining why he\u2019s bringing a preteen to watch a man who doesn\u2019t want her in this country deliver a speech in her nonnative tongue. (Today also happens to be her 12th birthday.) Merkley is part of a bumper crop of Democratic lawmakers who have their eyes set on the White House this year. They may be in the minority, but they\u2019re using Trump\u2019s State of the Union to draw attention to causes close to their hearts and to appeal to constituencies important to their campaigns. Ambitious members now approach the big speech as if they\u2019re asking someone to prom or maybe, because of the growing ranks of women in the legislative branch, the Sadie Hawkins dance. In 1913, Woodrow Wilson started the tradition of presidents delivering the constitutionally required update on the state of the country in person, rather than via letter. Ronald Reagan humanized it in 1982, starting what\u2019s become a ritual of presidents giving shout-outs to their guests when he praised Congressional Budget Office staffer Lenny Skutnik for jumping into the Potomac to save a woman after a plane crash. In recent years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have become much more deliberate about whom they give their tickets to. These invites often get positive coverage from hometown outlets that don\u2019t cover politics as much as they used to. Like so much else, this trend has supercharged in the Trump era. The guests have become symbols. Some might use a less charitable term: props. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) asks Defense Secretary Jim Mattis about\u00a0transgender troops during an Armed Services Committee hearing last year. (Jacquelyn Martin\/AP) -- Here\u2019s who other 2020 contenders invited \u2014 and what it says about their campaigns: -- Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who has been making a play for the LGBT donor community and has carved out a niche on the Armed Services committee, is bringing a transgender Navy officer. Lt. Commander Blake Dremann, who has had 11 overseas deployments, is president of SPARTA, an organization that advocates for transgender troops. Gillibrand will introduce a bill this week to protect transgender members who are already in the armed forces. The Supreme Court agreed two weeks ago to let the Trump administration\u2019s broad restrictions on transgender troops go into effect while the legal battle plays out in lower courts. \u201cTransgender service members like Lt. Commander Dremann make extraordinary sacrifices every day to defend our freedom and our most sacred values, and President Trump\u2019s decision to ban them from military service is cruel and undermines our military readiness,\u201d Gillibrand said in a statement. -- Health care will be a top-tier issue once again in next year\u2019s election, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) has focused on lowering drug prices. She\u2019s bringing Nicole Smith-Holt, whose son Alec had Type 1 diabetes and died at age 26 after losing health insurance coverage through her plan. She believes he was rationing insulin because of its high cost. The Washington Post Magazine published a profile last month of the mom from Richfield, Minn. \u201cNicole\u2019s story is absolutely heartbreaking\u2014no mother should have to watch her son decide between food and medication,\u201d Klobuchar said. -- Most of the Democratic candidates are trying to woo organized labor with their invitations. Trump\u2019s third address from the House chamber, after all, was postponed because of the longest partial government shutdown in U.S. history, which affected 800,000 mostly unionized federal workers. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is bringing Sajid Shahriar, a Boston-based employee of the Department of Housing and Urban Development who was furloughed during the shutdown. Shahriar is executive vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3258 and sits on the board of Massachusetts AFL-CIO. \u201cSajid has devoted his career to fighting for fair housing, equal pay, the dignity of all work, and strong collective bargaining rights for workers across this country,\u201d Warren\u2019s office said in a news release. \u201cIt's time to send a message to President Trump and Senate Republicans: federal and contract workers are the backbone of our economy and their livelihoods should never be used as pawns in Republican political games,\u201d Warren said in a statement. An Air Force bus meant to transport Nancy Pelosi and other members of a congressional delegation for a trip to Afghanistan sits empty in front of the Capitol on Jan. 17 after President Trump blocked the speaker of the House from using a military aircraft during the partial government shutdown. (Joshua Roberts\/Reuters) Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) found an air traffic controller who got furloughed during the shutdown after losing her home in a wildfire. Trisha Pesiri-Dybvik is also active in the AFL-CIO \u2014 one of the most sought-after endorsements in a Democratic primary \u2014 and has three young kids. Her husband, Jed, is a Navy veteran who was forced to work without pay throughout the 35-day shutdown because his job as a controller was deemed essential. (Her position was not.) Harris said she chose Pesiri-Dybvik because she\u2019s the living embodiment of \u201cstrength and resilience.\u201d Adding insult to injury, the threat of flooding and mudslides \u2014 which have gotten worse in California because of climate change \u2014\u00a0forced the family to flee the property they rented in Camarillo after their home in Ventura burned down. \u201cSince the tragic loss of their home, Trisha, Jed, and their three children have worked diligently to bounce back and reestablish a sense of normalcy in their lives, even amidst an unnecessary government shutdown that caused both of them to miss their paychecks for over a month,\u201d Harris said in a statement. \u201cWashington needs to hear her story.\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is bringing Rita Lewis for the second year in a row. Rita\u2019s husband Butch, who passed away in 2015, was a Vietnam veteran, truck driver and a member of the Teamsters who became an activist to preserve underfunded pension plans. She\u2019s continued his work. \u201cBrown continues working to highlight the pension crisis that threatens more than 60,000 Ohioans and 1.3 million workers and retirees nationwide,\u201d his office said in a news release. -- Bernie Sanders will again deliver his own live-streamed response, in addition to the official Democratic speech by former Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams and the Spanish-language response from California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. The Vermont senator\u2019s spokesman didn\u2019t respond to an email asking who will get his tickets. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) will announce his guest later today, a spokeswoman said. -- Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), who is not as serious about running for president as his colleagues but continues to keep the door open, is bringing his daughter with him, an aide emailed this morning. -- Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who has been traveling to the early states as he mulls a long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination, is highlighting his support for gun control by bringing a survivor of last February\u2019s shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla. The student, Cameron Kasky, has advocated for tough new gun laws since the massacre that killed 17 people last Valentine\u2019s Day. The 18-year-old co-founded an advocacy group called Never Again MSD and helped organize the March for Our Lives protests. \u201cThe shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., happened while I was in congressional orientation in December 2012, and I figured Congress would have to act,\u201d Swalwell said in a statement. \u201cAs Republicans stymied all efforts since then, I started to grow frustrated but the \u2026 voices of the Parkland generation have inspired me to renew our efforts.\u201d WHAT TO EXPECT TONIGHT: -- News: Trump is expected to announce a campaign to halt transmission of HIV in the United States by 2030, a goal some experts say is within reach. Lenny Bernstein, Lena Sun and Amy Goldstein report: \u201cThe U.S. Health and Human Services Department is expected to roll out the plan within days of Trump\u2019s address ... Greg Millett, director of public policy for the American Foundation for AIDS Research, said the initial plan may focus on wiping out HIV transmission in 46 U.S. counties responsible for about half of all new HIV cases in the United States, based on information he has seen.\u201d -- The president continues to threaten that he will declare a national emergency to redirect Pentagon funding for the project, although aides said he is not expected to formally make that declaration during his speech. David Nakamura reports: \u201cWhite House officials insisted that Trump will not use the speech as a cudgel to pummel Democrats over the wall and play solely to his conservative base. The president certainly intends to make a robust defense of his immigration agenda, they said, but also will spend time discussing areas where he hopes to forge consensus, including around infrastructure projects and cutting the cost of prescription drugs. Aides said the president will obliquely address the government shutdown \u2026 by charting a path forward on the budget fight and his demands for a border wall.\u201d \u201cTrump, aides said, will discuss the administration\u2019s trade war with China, which Trump has suggested could be the focus of a potential summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month in Asia,\u201d per David. \u201cTrump also is tentatively scheduled to hold a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this month, possibly in Vietnam. During his national address last year, Trump highlighted the Kim regime\u2019s brutality to build public pressure on Pyongyang, but this year, he is expected to hail progress in their nuclear weapons negotiations, even though experts have said North Korea has taken few tangible steps toward disarmament.\u201d (David also wrote an excellent story for today\u2019s newspaper about the North Korean defector who was hailed by Trump during last year\u2019s speech but now worries that the president is ignoring Kim\u2019s human rights abuses.) -- Trump\u2019s other guests, via Eli Rosenberg: \u201cGrace Eline, a child who was diagnosed with a brain tumor when she was 9; Judah Samet, a survivor of the Holocaust who lived through the shooting at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh; Ashley Evans, a recovering opioid addict; Elvin Hernandez, a special agent at the Department of Homeland Security who focuses on human trafficking; and Debra Bissell, Heather Armstrong and Madison Armstrong, family members of a Nevada couple who authorities say were killed by an undocumented immigrant.\u201d (Read the White House\u2019s news release with their bios.) -- Trump has been practicing the delivery of this speech more than usual because he wants to nail the dismount. \u201cAfter spending part of the weekend at Mar-a-Lago \u2026 working on the speech, Mr. Trump spent two hours going over it with Stephen Miller, his chief policy adviser, in the Oval Office,\u201d Annie Karni and Maggie Haberman report in the New York Times. \u201cHe also spent time on Monday practicing in the Map Room with a handful of senior administration officials. He was expected to do another teleprompter-and-lectern practice session there on Tuesday, with his aides giving him notes. \u2026 -- More WaPo team coverage: -- How it\u2019s playing elsewhere: -- Tune in: I\u2019ll be in the Capitol tonight for the speech and will offer pregame analysis from 8:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern as part of The Washington Post\u2019s live broadcast.

The Defense Department reported last week that 1,190 civilians have been killed by U.S. strikes in Iraq and Syria since 2014. But the monitoring group Airwars estimates the number is actually more than six times as high. (Missy Ryan) The watchdog group Freedom House downgraded the United States on its freedom index.

The research indicates that 13 million people at the poverty line receive no federal assistance and that Hispanics and Asians are least likely to receive such benefits. (Tracy Jan) Several New England Patriots have already said they have no interest in visiting the White House after their Super Bowl victory. At least one player expressed interest in meeting with Barack Obama, as the NBA champion Golden State Warriors did. \u201cThat would be dope,\u201d Patriots safety Duron Harmon said, adding:\u00a0\u201cHey, Obama, come holler at me.

Residents have already posted photos of crocodiles on their driveways and on top of toppled trees. (Amy B Wang) The chairman of Harvard University's astronomy department has argued that an interstellar object\u00a0flying past the orbit of Jupiter probably came from another civilization. But Avi Loeb\u2019s theory of an extraterrestrial spacecraft has been largely rejected by his colleagues, who have called it a \u201cshocking example of sensationalist, ill-motivated science.\u201d (Avi Selk) FOLLOW THE MONEY: --\u00a0Federal prosecutors in New York served a sweeping subpoena yesterday to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, seeking\u00a0all information related to donors, vendors, contractors, bank accounts of the inaugural committee and any information related to foreign contributors to the committee.\u00a0Rosalind S. Helderman and Michael Kranish reviewed a copy: \u201cOnly U.S. citizens and legal residents can legally donate to a committee established to finance presidential inaugural festivities. \u2026 The subpoena \u2014 issued by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York \u2014 indicates that prosecutors are investigating crimes related to conspiracy to defraud the United States, mail fraud, false statements, wire fraud and money laundering. ...\u00a0Much of the committee\u2019s fundraising and operation was headed by Rick Gates, a former senior Trump campaign official who served as a deputy chairman of the inaugural committee and is cooperating with prosecutors as part of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation. ... \u201cThe subpoena also specifically seeks all communications with one donor, Los Angeles venture capitalist Imaad Zuberi, as well as the firm with which he is affiliated, Avenue Ventures. The company donated $900,000 to the inaugural committee, records show. Steve Rabinowitz, a spokesman for Zuberi, said in a telephone interview that Zuberi knew nothing about the subpoena until contacted by a reporter. \u2026 \u00a0Asked whether there was any foreign connection to Zuberi\u2019s donation, Rabinowitz said: \u2018There is no connection of any other individual or entity, and for sure not a foreign one. He gave his own money.\u2019 \u201cAfter Trump\u2019s election, Zuberi, a longtime Democratic donor, swiftly emerged as a major contributor to the new president and Republicans.\u00a0On his Facebook page, Zuberi indicated that he visited Trump Tower in New York in December 2016 as the president-elect prepared to take office, writing that he was with incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn. That was the same day that a delegation from Qatar, including the county\u2019s foreign minister, visited Trump Tower and met with Flynn and campaign chief executive Stephen K. Bannon. Rabinowitz said Zuberi met with the Qataris that day, walked with them to Trump Tower and rode up the elevator with them, but did not participate in their meetings with Trump officials. Zuberi indicated on his Facebook page that he met with the Qatari foreign minister at the Plaza Hotel in New York the following day. Days later, he visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, his Facebook posts show.\u201d -- A lobbyist who attended the infamous Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 received mysterious payments totaling half a million dollars,\u00a0BuzzFeed News reports: \u201cDocuments ... show that Rinat Akhmetshin, a Soviet military officer turned Washington lobbyist, deposited large, round-number amounts of cash in the months preceding and following the meeting, where a Russian lawyer offered senior Trump campaign officials dirt on Hillary Clinton. The lobbyist also received a large payment that bank investigators deemed suspicious from Denis Katsyv, whose company Prevezon Holdings was accused by the US Justice Department of laundering the proceeds of a $230 million Russian tax fraud.\u201d Mueller\u2019s team pulled bank information on the meeting\u2019s attendees, but it\u2019s not clear whether the payments themselves are under investigation. -- The Justice Department and congressional Democrats are barreling toward a battle over publicly releasing any final report from Mueller. Devlin Barrett reports: \u201cWhen Mueller gives his findings to the Justice Department, it will probably be Democrats demanding a full airing of his reasoning and findings. \u2026 Democrats making such demands can point to a very recent and relevant example: In the past year, Republican lawmakers have gained access to a great deal of investigative material about both the 2016 investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server and the ongoing Russia inquiry. ...\u00a0Several current and former law enforcement officials who have worked with Mueller in the past say they expect him to describe in detail what he found about the individuals he charged with crimes but be far more circumspect and limited in discussing those people who are not accused of any crimes.\u201d -- Paul Manafort\u2019s first sentencing hearing has been set for March 13. CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz reports: \u201cManafort will be sentenced on the two charges he pleaded guilty to -- conspiracy and witness tampering -- as part of his admission that he had orchestrated a vast lobbying and money laundering criminal scheme. \u2026 At a later date that isn't yet set, Manafort will be sentenced by a separate federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia for eight financial crimes for which he was convicted at trial last summer.\u201d DEMOCRATIC DRAMA IN RICHMOND: -- Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) continued to weigh resigning over a racist yearbook photo as his potential successor, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D), denied a sexual assault allegation. Gregory S. Schneider and Laura Vozzella report: \u201cNortham gathered Cabinet members and staffers Monday to apologize ... and told them he was still weighing options, according to several people who attended. The governor urged staffers not to quit and promised to decide his fate soon, but how soon was left unsaid, according to three people \u2026 It could take days, according to one person familiar with his thinking. Northam is trying to assemble evidence to prove that he was not in that racist photo and is exploring whether he has enough support in the government to continue to be effective, according to several people who have spoken with the governor. \u2026 \u201cElected officials from both parties stood by their calls that Northam must go, but the way forward became cloudier Monday with the incendiary charges against Fairfax. The lieutenant governor vehemently denied the claim that he sexually assaulted a woman ...\u00a0\u2018She was very much into a consensual encounter,\u2019 Fairfax said about the 2004 incident. \u2018Everything was 100 percent consensual. And now, years later, we have a totally fabricated story out of the blue to attack me once I was in politics.\u2019 Fairfax, 39, called it an attempt to damage him. \u2018Does anybody think it\u2019s any coincidence that on the eve of my potentially being elevated, this uncorroborated smear comes up?\u2019 he said.\u201d -- The Fairfax allegation appeared on the conservative website Big League Politics, the same site that uncovered the Northam photo.\u00a0But the woman involved first approached The Post about her story after Fairfax was elected. Theresa Vargas reports: \u201cThe woman and Fairfax first met in Boston at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. During a conversation, the two realized they had a mutual friend. It was that commonality, she recalled, that put her at ease enough that on the afternoon Fairfax asked her to walk with him to his hotel room to pick up some papers, she thought nothing of joining him. Fairfax and the woman told different versions of what happened in the hotel room with no one else present. The Post could not find anyone who could corroborate either version. The Post did not find \u2018significant red flags and inconsistencies within the allegations,\u2019 as the Fairfax statement incorrectly said. \u2026 \u201cThe woman described a sexual encounter that began with consensual kissing and ended with a forced act that left her crying and shaken. She said Fairfax guided her to the bed, where they continued kissing, and then at one point she realized she could not move her neck. She said Fairfax used his strength to force her to perform oral sex. The Post, in phone calls to people who knew Fairfax from college, law school and through political circles, found no similar complaints of sexual misconduct against him. Without that, or the ability to corroborate the woman\u2019s account \u2014 in part because she had not told anyone what happened \u2014 The Post did not run a story. She said she never told anyone about what happened at the time or in the years that followed until shortly before she approached The Post.\u201d -- Fairfax suggested that Northam\u2019s office might be behind publicizing the allegation, a claim the governor\u2019s aides denied and that escalated tensions among Virginia Democrats. The New York Times\u2019s Jonathan Martin and Alan Blinder report: \u201cSpeaking to reporters outside the Capitol on Monday evening, Mr. Fairfax adjusted his stance slightly, saying he had \u2018no indication\u2019 that Mr. Northam himself was behind the publication of the sexual assault allegations but still decrying the \u2018sneaky\u2019 tactics that he said were being employed against him. Then Mr. Fairfax shifted targets and hinted that Mayor Levar Stoney of Richmond, a would-be rival to the lieutenant governor for the 2021 Democratic nomination for governor, may have played a role \u2014 praising the acumen of a reporter who inquired whether Mr. Stoney might have been responsible.\u201d -- The current provost of Northam\u2019s medical school alma mater banned the publication of the\u00a0yearbook after he objected to three students wearing Confederate uniforms in a 2013 edition. Jim Morrison reports: Eastern Virginia Medical School President Richard V. Homan\u00a0said the yearbook\u00a0\u201chad been largely run by students, with little oversight from the school\u2019s staff \u2014 although some graduates of EVMS from the 1980s have told The Washington Post the yearbooks were submitted for staff review. Homan said it did not occur to him at the time to review yearbooks from previous years, including the 1984 edition \u2026 At [an emergency] meeting, Homan told board members the school has hired former Virginia attorney general Richard Cullen, a partner at McGuireWoods, to lead an investigation into how racist photos came to be published in EVMS yearbooks.\u201d -- If that name sounds familiar, it's because Vice President Pence retained Cullen back in 2017 to deal with Mueller's inquiries. -- Northam is telling aides that, if he resigns, he would be remembered as a \u201cracist for life,\u201d and he thinks the only way he can clear his name is to stay in office and convince people that he is not in that photo and that the photo does not represent who he is,\u00a0CNN reports. President Trump and Vice President Pence are escorted by acting interior secretary David Bernhardt during a visit to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on MLK Day. (Evan Vucci\/AP) TRUMP ELEVATES LOYALISTS: -- Trump announced that he will nominate veteran energy lobbyist David Bernhardt to serve as interior secretary. Juliet Eilperin, Josh Dawsey and Darryl Fears report: \u201cIf confirmed, Bernhardt, a 49-year-old Colorado native known for his unrelenting work habits, would be well positioned to roll back even more of the Obama-era conservation policies he has worked to unravel since rejoining Interior a year and a half ago. He has helmed the department as acting secretary since Jan. 2, when Ryan Zinke resigned amid multiple ethics probes. \u2026 A former partner at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, he walked into the No. 2 job at Interior with so many potential conflicts of interest he has to carry a small card listing them all. He initially had to recuse himself from \u2018particular matters\u2019 directly affecting 26 former clients to conform with the Trump administration\u2019s ethics pledge. ...\u00a0Bernhardt\u2019s industry-friendly policies, coupled with his extensive work as a lobbyist, have earned him the enmity of environmental groups and many Democrats.\" Face time with POTUS helped get him the job: \u201cAs recently as a week ago, Trump was considering tapping former congresswoman Cynthia M. Lummis (R-Wyo.), a conservative who retired from the House in 2017. But the shutdown, coupled with Zinke\u2019s departure, also gave Bernhardt an opportunity to spend more time with the president as Trump weighed the vacancy. During a Cabinet meeting last month, Bernhardt sat next to the president, and he also accompanied Trump and Vice President Pence on a recent trip to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial near the Mall. \u2026 Bernhardt made it clear he was prepared to leave the administration if the president tapped someone else for the top job, according to two individuals familiar with the matter.\u201d -- Trump has decided to nominate an outspoken critic of the World Bank to lead the World Bank. Robert Costa reports: David\u00a0Malpass, 62, \u201cTreasury\u2019s undersecretary for international affairs, would need to be approved by the World Bank\u2019s 12-member board before becoming its president. The United States traditionally chooses the bank\u2019s leadership. Malpass, a Trump loyalist and veteran of the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, has had sharp words for several policies at the World Bank, including its loans to China. He has also long expressed skepticism of global institutions. \u2026 A\u00a0person close to Malpass said he would seek to be \u2018constructive\u2019 as World Bank president, but declined to detail much of his possible agenda, beyond saying his priorities would be raising incomes in developing nations and defending U.S. interests.\u201d -- Growing buzz on the right that Trump might try to replace RBG with his own anti-regulation czar Neomi Rao, 45, raises the stakes for her confirmation hearing today to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit,\u00a0Politico\u2019s Andrew Restuccia, Gabby Orr and Anita Kumar report: \u201cThe White House is already reaching out to conservative groups to prepare for Ginsburg\u2019s possible death or departure from the court. People close to the White House said Rao is among several contenders to replace her. \u2026 But whether Rao is ultimately picked will likely depend on the timing of a potential opening. Because Rao has no prior experience as a judge, conservative activists think she\u2019d need to spend at least a year on the D.C. Circuit before she\u2019d be seen as a top contender for the Supreme Court. \u2026 \u201cWhite House aides and outside conservatives close to the president have been quietly helping Rao prepare for her confirmation hearing for weeks,\u201d per Politico.\u00a0\u201cConservatives are discouraging talk of Rao as a future justice, recognizing that it will only draw more scrutiny of her record, which has recently been criticized over controversial positions like her defense of dwarf-tossing and past skepticism of date rape claims. [Rao] founded the Center for the Study of the Administrative State at George Mason University\u2019s law school \u2014 a hothouse of ideas about limiting the federal government\u2019s authority and size.\u201d -- Fed Chairman Jerome Powell dined with Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin a week after he announced the central bank would hold off on raising interest rates. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Nick Timiraos reports: \u201cMr. Trump hadn\u2019t met with Mr. Powell since he tapped him to lead the Fed in November 2017. \u2026 Mr. Powell\u2019s No. 2, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, also attended the dinner. The Fed said both men joined Messrs. Trump and Mnuchin at the invitation of the president to discuss the economy. \u2026 The Fed said of the dinner that Mr. Powell\u2019s \u2018comments in this setting were consistent with his remarks at his press conference of last week.\u2019\u201d -- Commerce Department officials rescinded an offer to a prominent D.C. lawyer to serve as the ZTE compliance coordinator after they discovered he had signed a \u201cNever Trump\u201d letter. The National Law Journal\u2019s C. Ryan Barber reports: \u201cThe U.S. Commerce Department had picked Peter Lichtenbaum, a Washington-based partner at the law firm Covington & Burling. \u2026 All that was left was the public announcement. \u2026 Instead, on the day Lichtenbaum expected his new role to be publicized, at least two Commerce officials compiled an extensive collection of news articles that identified the veteran trade and sanctions lawyer as one of the Republican signatories on a \u2018Never Trump\u2019 letter in 2016 ... The following week, the Commerce Department announced that Roscoe Howard, a Barnes & Thornburg partner who\u2019d previously served as U.S. attorney in Washington, would serve as the ZTE compliance monitor.\u201d THE IMMIGRATION WARS: -- The Trump Organization has now fired at least 18 undocumented workers from five of its golf courses following reports about the company\u2019s employment practices. Joshua Partlow and David A. Fahrenthold report: \u201cEric Trump, the president\u2019s son, confirmed the firings to The Washington Post on Monday. \u2026 The Washington Post could not independently verify Eric Trump\u2019s figures. There have also been firings at the Trump course in Bedminster, N.J., which his son did not address. \u2026 The wave of dismissals raises questions about how widely the president\u2019s company has relied on undocumented workers, even as he has denounced illegal immigration in fiery terms and demanded the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\u201d -- If Trump decides to move forward with an emergency declaration, he would be able to tap into $20 billion from military construction projects approved by Congress but not yet underway. Erica Werner and Karoun Demirjian report: \u201cHundreds of projects could be at risk of losing their funding to Trump\u2019s wall \u2014 including a $60 million aircraft maintenance hangar at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina, a $105 million command and control facility at Fort Shafter in Hawaii, and a $32 million vehicle maintenance shop at Fort Campbell in Kentucky. Lawmakers have begun raising alarms about their home-state projects getting targeted. \u2026 This type of domestic blowback, which could surface in numerous states, including some critical to Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection prospects, has led to expectations among congressional aides in both parties that Trump could go after overseas construction projects first.\u201d -- Republican senators who oppose Trump\u2019s proposal to declare a national emergency on the southern border to get wall funding could be forced to publicly rebuke him if House Democrats pass a resolution of disapproval. Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett and Marianne Levine report: \u201cInterviews with a dozen GOP senators on Monday revealed broad efforts to wave Trump from doing an end run around Congress, part of an effort to avoid a politically perilous floor vote that could place them at odds with the president. If the House were to pass a formal resolution of disapproval, the Senate would be forced to take it up with a majority threshold required for passage under procedural rules. That would mean just four GOP defections along with all Democrats would be enough to rebuke the president. Trump could still win that vote, as no GOP senators would commit to voting against the president ...\u00a0But just a handful of Republicans right now are publicly committing to standing with Trump, suggesting the president could face a brutal intraparty fight should he move forward.\u201d -- The Republican opposition is the latest indication that Trump\u2019s approach of governing through fear is wearing thin after two years in office. The New York Times\u2019s Michael Tackett and Maggie Haberman report: \u201cFew outside the Republican Party are afraid of him, and they may be less intimidated after the disastrous government shutdown. But Mr. Trump has shown little inclination to modulate his style, and that carries risks. He could well face a challenge for the Republican nomination in 2020, and congressional Republicans from swing states could begin to distance themselves from him. One of the clearest signals came last week when Republicans, backing an amendment offered by [Mitch McConnell], opposed the president\u2019s call for withdrawal of United States military forces from Syria and Afghanistan as part of a Middle East policy bill.\u201d -- To defuse a subpoena threat, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen agreed to testify before a House panel next month on border-security issues. John Wagner reports: \u201cIn a blistering letter to Nielsen last week, [House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.)] said it was \u2018outrageous\u2019 that she was pointing to the shutdown as an \u2018excuse\u2019 not to voluntarily appear before the committee. \u2018If she says she\u2019s not coming, we\u2019ll subpoena her to the committee,\u2019 Thompson said in an interview with The Post at the time. \u2026 In a statement Monday, Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), the top Republican on the committee, praised Thompson for deciding to work with Nielsen to arrange voluntarily testimony for March 6.\u201d -- Construction equipment arrived at the National Butterfly Center in Mission, Tex., to start building the border wall. The San Antonio Express-News\u2019s Silvia Foster-Frau reports: \u201cCongress approved funding for this section of the wall in last year\u2019s federal budget, before the impasse between Democrats and [Trump] held up another round of wall funding and led to the recent 35-day partial government shutdown. As equipment for the construction was off-loaded Monday morning, a group of about 35 tribal members, including the Floresville-based Carrizo Comecrudo, marched in protest on the Rio Grande levee where the wall will be built.\u201d Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) speaks during a news conference outside his home on Friday after he declared his bid for the presidency. (Julio Cortez\/AP) MORE ON 2020: -- Democratic presidential candidates are competing for the best political talent in South Carolina to help them get an edge in the state\u2019s crucial primary. CNN\u2019s Caroline Kenny and Jasmine Wright report: \u201cIn a presidential year when black voters are likely to have outsize influence in selecting the Democratic nominee, all of the campaigns are focused on building the strongest operations possible in a state where black voters comprised 61% of the Democratic electorate in the 2016 primary election. \u2026 In recent weeks, advisers for Kamala Harris, Joe Biden and Cory Booker, as well as other White House aspirants, have engaged in a fierce battle for operatives in the first-in-the-South primary state. They have courted potential hires with job offers and big titles\u2014or in Biden's case, a promise that the wait would be worth it\u2014as they seek to build their broader network of influencers in the state.\u201d -- It\u2019s still unclear whether Booker\u2019s long-standing friendship with the state\u2019s Republican Sen. Tim Scott will become a liability or an asset in the race. Emma Dumain reports for the State:\u00a0\u201cBooker is expected to tout his record of working across the aisle as he campaigns in the pivotal early primary state of South Carolina. One of Booker\u2019s strongest bipartisan relationships is with Scott. \u2026 The danger in naming Scott as a friend and sometimes ally could be that Booker gets attacked for being too conciliatory towards Republicans. As Democrats fight for the future of their party, many argue they must move farther to the left, leaving little room for cooperation in the middle.\u201d -- Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s prospects of winning the Democratic nomination if he enters the race have dimmed in the eyes of many strategists. McClatchy\u2019s Katie Glueck reports: \u201cIn a contest for his party\u2019s nomination, O\u2019Rourke would confront not [Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.)]\u2014a hero to conservatives, an archvillain to Democrats\u2014but a growing list of credentialed Democratic candidates. Many of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s potential rivals have more experience (Joe Biden), stronger connections to the Democratic Party\u2019s diverse base (Kamala Harris, Cory Booker), and tighter bonds with the party\u2019s increasingly vocal liberal wing (Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders) than he does. And many have been organizing in the early states for weeks if not months.\u201d -- A new Monmouth University poll indicates Democratic voters are prioritizing candidates\u2019 perceived ability to beat Trump over their policy positions. The university reports: \u201cJust under 4-in-10 registered voters (38%) say that Trump should be re-elected in 2020. A majority of 57% say it is time for someone new in the Oval Office. \u2026\u00a0In considering who should be their party\u2019s standard bearer, a majority of 56% [of Democrats] prefer someone who would be a strong candidate against Trump even if they disagree with that candidate on most issues.\u00a0Just 33% say they would prefer a nominee who they are aligned with on the issues even if that person would have a hard time beating Trump.\u201d -- Democratic candidates are offering competing visions on how to unite the country. Michael Scherer reports: \u201cThe different approaches have less to do with policy than political strategy, as the Democratic candidates remain relatively united on the broad direction of their policy focus \u2014 the need for more progressive tax policy, expanded health-care coverage and continued advancements in the fight against discrimination based on race, gender or sexual orientation. \u2026 Instead, the Democratic contenders are offering contrasting story lines for knitting the country back together at a time when racial, ethnic, gender and geographic differences increasingly determine political allegiance.\u201d -- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) appeared at a New Hampshire event\u00a0but definitively ruled out running for president. \u201cI, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, am not old enough to run for president,\u201d the 58-year-old Schiff joked at a \u201cPolitics & Eggs\u201d event when asked about running. He then added:\u00a0\u201cOkay, I\u2019m a little older than that. I\u2019m not running.\u201d (John Wagner) -- A former Democratic speaker of the Colorado House joined a growing field of candidates hoping to take on Sen. Cory Gardner (R) next year. Colorado Politics\u2019s Ernest Luning reports: \u201cIn appearances at Democratic county reorganization meetings Saturday, [Andrew] Romanoff stopped short of officially announcing his candidacy. But he previewed his campaign by outlining policy disagreements with Gardner and invited supporters to sign up for \u2018news from this next venture\u2019 using their cell phones or by contacting volunteers bearing clipboards.\u201d -- Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) has already started preparing in earnest for his election next year after O\u2019Rourke nearly pulled off an upset against Cruz. Politico\u2019s James Arkin reports: \u201cCornyn has already stockpiled more campaign cash than any other senator: $5.8 million. He\u2019s filling high-level campaign jobs. And crucially, Cornyn secured early endorsements from Cruz and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, two of the most prominent conservatives in the state, in a show of force to prevent a primary challenge. It\u2019s all part of Cornyn\u2019s resolve not to become the first statewide Republican casualty in rapidly changing Texas.\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: The manager for Northam's 2017 opponent blamed the Republican Governors Association for not finding the Northam yearbook photo, per an NBC News reporter: A Times reporter made this remarkable observation: A CNN analyst considered how a moderate Democrat might fit into the 2020 field: Elizabeth Warren prodded a former Republican lawmaker about her post-Congress plans: Comstock replied: A familiar face appeared at a Brooklyn Nets game: The former prime minister of Sweden remembered this piece of communication with another world leader: A freshman Republican lawmaker posed this question after the Super Bowl: And a freshman Democratic congresswoman replied: And Danica Roem, the first openly transgender person to be elected to the Virginia General Assembly, shared this picture from a fan: A GOOD READ\u00a0FROM ELSEWHERE: -- AP, \u201cHistorians irked by musical \u2018Hamilton\u2019 escalate their duel,\u201d by Mark Kennedy: \u201cEver since the historical musical \u2018Hamilton\u2019 began its march to near-universal infatuation, one group has noticeably withheld its applause \u2014 historians. Many academics argue the portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the star of our $10 bills, is a counterfeit. Now they\u2019re escalating their fight. Ishmael Reed, who has been nominated twice for a National Book Award, has chosen to fight fire with fire \u2014 collecting his critique of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s acclaimed show into a play. Reed\u2019s \u2018The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019 is an uncompromising take-down of \u2018Hamilton,\u2019 reminding viewers of the Founding Father\u2019s complicity in slavery and his war on Native Americans.\u201d HOT ON THE LEFT: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s election set off a birth control boom,\u201d from the Boston Globe: \u201cBrigham and Women\u2019s Hospital researchers have documented a trend in women\u2019s health that had previously been reported mostly anecdotally: [Trump\u2019s] election set off a birth control boom. In the immediate aftermath of the Nov. 8, 2016, upset election, women rushed to secure long-acting, reversible contraception \u2014 the kind that could feasibly last through the duration of a Trump presidency. Compared to the same monthlong period in the previous year, demand for IUDs and other implants spiked 21.6 percent, according to the study, which was published in JAMA Internal Medicine online Monday.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT: \u201cChristian university cancels Ben Shapiro speech for campus 'unity,\u2019\u201d from Fox News: \u201cThe largest Christian university is under fire for canceling a speech from Jewish conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.

The decision immediately drew a firestorm of criticism. \u2018By caving to an unseen mob and ignoring the popularity of Shapiro among its student body, Grand Canyon University just played itself and deserves whatever negative response this brings,\u2019 YAF spokesman Spencer Brown said in a statement.\u201d \u00a0 DAYBOOK: Trump will deliver his State of the Union address at the Capitol at 9\u00a0p.m. EST.\u00a0 QUOTE OF THE DAY:\u00a0 Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) implored his Republican colleagues to support Trump if he declares an emergency at the southern border to get wall funding: \u201cTo every Republican, if you don\u2019t stand behind this president, we\u2019re not going to stand behind you, when it comes to the wall,\u201d Graham said in a speech in his home state. \u201cThis is the defining moment of his presidency.

Council is considering a bill to better protect those seeking divorces from abusive partners. Samantha Schmidt reports: \u201cThe bill, which [D.C. Council member Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1)] reintroduced this year after a hearing was not scheduled in the fall, would also allow for an injured spouse to be granted a divorce within three months of the finding of an incident of domestic violence. \u2026 D.C. law currently allows judges to consider domestic violence as one of many factors when they are dividing up property in a divorce. But Nadeau\u2019s bill would make clear that domestic violence should be a determining factor and that \u2018the offending spouse should not be entitled to profit from his misdeeds,\u2019 Brody said.\u201d -- Education officials are debating whether the District\u2019s charter schools should be subject to the same rules governing public schools. Perry Stein reports: \u201cThe more than 100 charter schools in the District are regulated by the D.C. Public Charter School Board, which is considering whether to compel charter campuses to post more data and information on their websites \u2014 a move it says is intended to make school information more accessible. Under the rules, charter schools, which are run by their own boards, would have to publicize when those boards meet and detail how they plan to spend money that is given to schools \u2014 traditional and charter \u2014 to provide additional services to the city\u2019s most vulnerable children.\u201d VIDEOS OF THE DAY: Late-night hosts were skeptical about Northam's explanations for the racist photo in his yearbook: Heavy flooding caused a bridge to collapse in Bosnia: And the Pope visited the\u00a0presidential palace in Abu Dhabi during his historic visit to the UAE:","42":"With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0Barack Obama pleaded with a crowd of teenagers on Tuesday night to defy stereotypes about what it means to be a man of color.  \u201cWe live in a culture where our worth is measured by how much money we have and how famous we are,\u201d the former president lamented in Oakland, Calif.\u00a0\u201cI will tell you, at the end of the day, the thing that will give you confidence is not that. I know a lot of rich people that are all messed up!\u201d Joined onstage by Golden State Warriors basketball star Steph Curry, Obama decried bullying and selfishness while imploring young people who are involved in his My Brother\u2019s Keeper initiative to pursue causes greater than themselves. He explained the concept of self-worth and touted the virtues of being sensitive to other people\u2019s feelings. He criticized materialism and encouraged monogamy. \u201cIf you are really confident about your financial situation, you probably are not going to be wearing an eight-pound chain around your neck because you know, \u2018I got bank. I don\u2019t have to show you how much I\u2019ve got because I feel good,\u2019\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf you are very confident about your sexuality, you don't have to have eight women around you twerking \u2026 because [you know], \u2018I\u2019ve got one woman, who I am very happy with. And she\u2019s a strong woman.\u2019\u201d Obama blamed pop culture for amplifying toxic messages about modern masculinity. \u201cLet\u2019s face it: A\u00a0lot of hip-hop and rap music is built around me showing how I got more money than you, I can disrespect you and you can\u2019t do nothing about it, I\u2019m going to talk about you and punk you,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIronically, that actually shows the vulnerability that you feel! \u201cWe tend to rise to the expectations that are set for us,\u201d added Obama. \u201cIf a young boy is taught early on, \u2018You are going to be kind to people, not bully people,\u2019 that will have an impact. If you say, \u2018You treat young women with respect. They are not objects. They are humans with the same aspirations and desires, and they are just as worthy of respect as you are,\u2019 that has an impact. We\u2019ve got to set that tone early in life.\u201d The town-hall-style Q&A offered a timely reminder of the moral authority that\u2019s traditionally been vested in our presidents, both current and former. Obama repeatedly touted the importance of respecting, and listening to, women and then discussed race in a candid way. \u201cOften times, historically, racism in this society sends a message that you are less than and weak, so we feel like we\u2019ve got to compensate by exaggerating certain stereotypical ways that men are supposed to act,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a trap that we fall into, that we have to pull out of. If you\u2019re confident about your strength, you don\u2019t need to show me by putting someone else down. Show me how strong you are in that you can lift someone else up and treat someone well and be respectful.\u201d -- The event was held to mark the fifth anniversary of My Brother's Keeper, an initiative Obama started after the shooting death in 2012 of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed\u00a017-year-old. \u201cSome of you remember, although some of you were so young you may not,\u201d the former president said. \u201cAs somebody who is the head of federal law enforcement, I could not comment on the particulars of the case, but what I could say was that Trayvon could have been my son. \u2026 It required us as a society to wake up.\u201d (Left unsaid was that President Trump does not feel so reticent about weighing in on active federal law enforcement investigations.) The singer John Legend, who performed a cover of Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On\u201d for the crowd, led a panel discussion with the mothers of Martin, Oscar Grant and Jordan Davis. \u201cIt\u2019s not about Trayvon anymore; it\u2019s about the young people in here,\u201d said Sybrina Fulton, Martin\u2019s mother. \u201cAlthough Trayvon is not here for me to watch grow, to watch him excel, I want all those things for you. \u2026 I want you to be educated. I want you to be strong. I want you to be leaders, not followers.\u201d -- Obama has grown plainly more comfortable discussing issues related to race since leaving office liberated him. \u201cWhat we want to do is create a space in which young men of color, and young men generally, do not feel as if, \u2018For me to be respected in my community, I\u2019ve got to act a certain way,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the violence and pain that we suffer in our communities arises out of young men who nobody has said to them what it means to be respected. So they are looking around and thinking, \u2018Well, I guess being respected means [that] I can make you back down.\u2019 Or, \u2018I can disrespect you, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u2019 That is a self-defeating model for being a man! So we have to constantly lift up examples of the successful men who don\u2019t take that approach. That\u2019s hard to do in this society.\u201d -- Discussing criminal justice policy, Obama made clear that law enforcement can be a force for good. \u201cIn fact, some communities need more police, not fewer police,\u201d he said. The former president said it\u2019s important that cops get training and build relationships on their beats so that they understand just because someone is \u201cwearing a hoodie does not mean they\u2019re a criminal.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just the style,\u201d Obama said. Barack Obama hugs Golden State Warriors basketball star Stephen Curry on Tuesday night after speaking at the My Brother's Keeper Alliance summit in Oakland, Calif.\u00a0(Jeff Chiu\/AP) -- The graying 57-year-old, who for eight years was the most powerful man on the planet, tried earnestly to relate and connect with an audience of black, Latino and Native American teenage males who are fighting to escape cycles of poverty, dependency and violence. The goal of the public-private initiative, which is now part of the Obama Foundation and has spread to nearly 250 cities, is to help minority boys who face a variety of systemic disadvantages. Obama noted that government alone cannot fix problems, and that local governments often play a more important role than the federal government. He said he\u2019s now focused more on the civil society elements of the work because he doesn\u2019t hold elected office.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to be working on these issues, along with a host of other issues, for the remainder of my life,\u201d Obama said. A teenager from a Native American school in Albuquerque asked what struggles he went through as a kid. \u201cI didn\u2019t know my father very well. I met him once, and that was it,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI was all kinds of screwed up when I was in high school. I was a good kid in the sense that I think I was always kind to people. I didn\u2019t have a mean spirit. But I did not have a sense of purpose or a clear sense of direction through a big chunk of my high school years. In retrospect, I recognize some of it was I was angry about my father not being there. Some of it was I was growing up in an environment as an African American boy where we didn\u2019t have a large African American community. So there were all sorts of reasons for why I was acting out the way I did. \u2026 \u201cWhat ended up being the most important thing is when I stopped thinking about myself, and I started thinking about how I could be useful to other people,\u201d he continued. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up and become the person I am until I was less focused on me and I was more focused on how I could be useful and who I could help. \u2026 When you\u2019re helping somebody \u2026 and you see the impact, that gives you confidence.\u201d Obama said a lot of dads want to be around for their families, but they are not because of mass incarceration, discrimination and the lack of job opportunities. \u201cWe can all be surrogate fathers,\u201d said the dad to two daughters. \u201cMy father might not have been in my house, but there were a whole bunch of men who taught me something and guided me.\u201d -- In honor of Black History Month, Obama shared a nonfiction reading list ahead of the event to help people \u201cbetter understand our country\u2019s past and our evolving, persistent struggles with race.\u201d The former president\u2019s list has some great titles that complement the syllabus I prepared for Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) last week: Obama also shared a link to a New York Times story from March 2018 about data showing the \u201cpunishing reach of racism for black boys.\u201d\u00a0 -- The former president mostly steered clear of politics, though he noted at one point that the Trump administration has reversed the guidance his administration issued to local school districts to lower suspension rates among communities of color. The crowd booed. \u201cNobody hears your boos,\u201d Obama answered. \u201cThey\u2019ll hear your vote.\u201d  He said it\u2019s ultimately up to young people to get involved and change the system. \u201cThe truth of the matter is that nothing changes if citizens living in communities aren\u2019t paying attention and aren\u2019t educating themselves about how decisions are made about a school board, how decisions are made about police oversight, how decisions are made about drug laws,\u201d said Obama. \u201cYou can have a bunch of politicians or celebrities talk all they want, but ultimately what will actually bring about change is when all of you go back to your respective communities and activate and educate yourselves and then insist whoever it is that\u2019s in charge of making those decisions is making them \u2026 for the right reasons and in the right way. And if there are people who aren\u2019t doing that, they should be replaced. And if there\u2019s nobody to replace them, then you should step up and prepare yourself to replace them.\u201d WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Federal offices in Washington, along with schools and universities in the area, will be closed today because of\u00a0a winter storm.\u00a0Two to four inches of snow will probably accumulate in the immediate metro area this morning before turning into sleet and freezing rain. The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: \u201cHazardous road conditions are likely through the morning hours, with gradual improvement from south to north later this afternoon into the evening. But that\u2019s only after a period of sleet and freezing rain covers parts of the area, mainly north and west of D.C., with a glaze of ice in time for what\u2019s left of an afternoon commute.

Juliet Eilperin and Missy Ryan report: \u201cThe committee, which would be established by executive order, is being spearheaded by William Happer, a National Security Council senior director. Happer, an emeritus professor of physics at Princeton University, has said that carbon emissions linked to climate change should be viewed as an asset rather than a pollutant.

Mark Mazzetti, Maggie Haberman, Nicholas Fandos and Michael S. Schmidt report.\u00a0Here are the most interesting details: -- The FBI developed a backup plan to protect evidence from its Russia investigation after Trump fired Jim Comey,\u00a0the AP\u2019s Eric Tucker reports: \u201cThe goal was to ensure that the information collected under the investigations \u2026 would survive the firings or reassignments of top law enforcement officials. Those officials included [Bob Mueller], who was appointed eight days after Trump fired Comey in May 2017. Andrew McCabe, who became acting director after Comey was fired, asked investigators to develop a plan to ensure evidence would be protected.\u201d -- The federal judge overseeing Roger Stone\u2019s criminal case has scheduled a hearing for tomorrow to consider whether his conditions of release should be modified or revoked after he posted (and later deleted) a photo of the judge with what looked like a gun\u2019s crosshairs near her head. Reis Thebault, Manuel Roig-Franzia and Rachel Weiner report: \u201cIn a text message to The Washington Post on Tuesday, Stone wrote: \u2018I will be present for the hearing as ordered.\u2019 He also offered another explanation for the image in the photo, writing that \u2018it is evidentially more correctly a Celtic symbol.\u2019 \u2026 In an appearance Monday on Infowars, the conspiracy-minded website, Stone described the image in the photo he posted as an \u2018occult symbol.\u2019\u201d Attorney General William Barr listens as Trump declares a national emergency during a speech in the Rose Garden on\u00a0Friday. (Jabin Botsford\/The Washington Post) -- Trump last night nominated Jeffrey Rosen, the deputy secretary of transportation, to replace Rod Rosenstein as deputy attorney general. Rosen used to work at Kirkland & Ellis with William Barr, the new AG. \u201cSome Justice Department employees say Barr, who has not publicly addressed the president\u2019s latest criticisms of the Russia investigation, has buoyed spirits in a department that has had a rocky two years,\u201d\u00a0Philip Rucker and Matt Zapotosky report. \u201cBarr, people who know him say, is laboring to maintain his reputation as a relatively independent and principled leader while simultaneously reacting to pressure from his boss, who demands loyalty from his appointees and nominees and frequently disparages the Justice Department as it investigates his campaign and conduct.\u201d Sidebar: \u201cComplicating Barr\u2019s position is the fact that his son-in-law, Tyler McGaughey, a Justice Department lawyer, recently began working in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office. McGaughey, who had been prosecuting major crimes in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Alexandria, was among several lawyers there who have been detailed to the White House.\u201d -- Trump is so angry at Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats that White House staffers and senior Hill Republicans worry the president might fire the former GOP senator. Shane Harris, Josh Dawsey and Ellen Nakashima report: \u201cTrump is still \u2018enraged\u2019 about Coats\u2019s congressional testimony on national security threats last month, believing that the director undercut the president\u2019s authority when he shared intelligence assessments about Iran, North Korea and the Islamic State that are at odds with many of Trump\u2019s public statements, said one adviser who spoke with the president over the weekend. \u2026 A White House official said the president\u2019s frustration with Coats was real but didn\u2019t believe he would be fired anytime soon.\u00a0...\u00a0Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee were upset by the prospect of Coats\u2019s firing. ... \u201cLast July, Coats was being interviewed onstage at the annual Aspen Security Forum when the White House announced via tweet that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been invited to Washington. Coats was clearly taken by surprise and made little effort to hide his displeasure. \u2026 Coats also said no one had asked him if it was a good idea for Trump to meet privately with Putin at a summit meeting in Helsinki. \u2026 Coats said that he hadn\u2019t been told what happened in the meeting. If asked, he said, he\u2019d have advised the president against speaking one-on-one with Putin and that U.S. security officials were concerned there were no notes taken. \u2026 Trump was livid, and believed that Coats was trying to embarrass him in a room filled with high-ranking current and former national security officials \u2026 Two days later, Coats publicly apologized for what he called an \u2018admittedly awkward response\u2019 to the news of the Putin invitation.\u201d -- Speaking of Putin, the Russian president said this morning that Russia's new missiles will target the United States if Washington ever deploys missiles in Europe.

(Sergio Moraes\/Reuters) FOLLOW THE MONEY: -- \u201cKey members of the Trump administration pushed a plan to sell nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia in the months after the inauguration despite objections from members of the National Security Council and other senior White House officials, according to a new report from congressional Democrats,\u201d per Tom Hamburger, Steven Mufson and Ellen Nakashima. \u201cThe 24-page report from the House Oversight and Reform Committee is based on internal White House documents and the accounts of unnamed whistleblowers. It said the objectors \u2014 including White House lawyers and National Security Council officials \u2014 opposed the plan out of concern that it violated laws designed to prevent the transfer of nuclear technology that could be used to support a weapons program. \u201cThe possible sale of nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia was discussed in the Oval Office just last week. The meeting included Energy Secretary Rick Perry, representatives from the NSC and State Department, and a dozen nuclear industry chief executives, one of the people present told The Washington Post. \u201cThe report, key elements of which were confirmed by people directly familiar with the matter, cites whistleblowers who said that the Trump appointees \u2018ignored directives from top ethics advisers who repeatedly \u2014 but unsuccessfully \u2014 ordered senior White House officials to halt their efforts.\u2019 \u2026 \u201cThe report released Tuesday notes that one of the power plant manufacturers that could benefit from a nuclear deal, Westinghouse Electric, is a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management, the company that has provided financial relief to the family of Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and a senior White House adviser. Brookfield Asset Management took a 99-year lease on the Kushner family\u2019s deeply indebted New York City property at 666 Fifth Ave. Kushner is preparing for a trip to the Middle East to discuss the economic component of his Middle East peace initiative \u2026 A lawyer for Kushner did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\u201d -- Deutsche Bank executives were so worried the Trump Organization would default on about $340 million\u00a0of loans after the 2016 election that they considered extending payment rates past 2025, when the president\u2019s potential second term would be completed. From Bloomberg News\u2019s Gavin Finch, Steven Arons and Shahien Nasiripour: \u201cThe bank ultimately decided against restructuring the loans to the Trump Organization, which come due in 2023 and 2024, and chose instead not to do any new business with Trump while he is president \u2026\u00a0The outstanding Deutsche Bank debt includes $125 million for the Trump National Doral Miami resort, which matures in 2023, according to federal records and mortgage documents. The company also owes $170 million for the Trump International Hotel in Washington and has another loan against a Chicago tower, both of which come due in 2024. ...\u00a0In the four years before his election, Trump borrowed more than $620 million from Deutsche Bank and a separate lender, Ladder Capital, to finance projects in Manhattan, Chicago, Washington and a Miami suburb.\" Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross participates in trade talks on Jan. 30. (Jim Watson\/AFP\/Getty Images) ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN AND WOMEN: -- The Office of Government Ethics declined to certify Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\u2019s financial disclosure form, which it described as \u201cnot accurate.\u201d CNN\u2019s Gregory Wallace, Ellie Kaufman and Donna Borak report: \u201cEmory Rounds, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, wrote that Ross reported in his annual financial disclosure that he sold bank stock that other reports indicate he did not sell. That meant \u2018the filer was therefore not in compliance with his ethics agreement at the time of the report,\u2019 Rounds wrote. The watchdog group that drew attention to the report, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said OGE declining to certify a report \u2018does not normally happen.\u2019\u201d -- In response, Ross said he didn't mean to file incorrect financial disclosures. Reis Thebault reports: \u201cRoss said he mistakenly believed he had sold the assets in question \u2014 100 shares of BankUnited stock \u2014 in May 2017. When he realized his error, he said, he sold the stock and disclosed the sale in October 2018. The shares, Ross said, were worth $3,700, an amount that federal regulations deem 'below the threshold of a possible conflict of interest.'\u00a0(According to a Bloomberg News report, that threshold is $15,000 for publicly traded securities.) \"'Therefore, even if a BankUnited matter had come before the Department while I owned the shares \u2014 and I have not been made aware of any such matter \u2014 I would not have been disqualified from working on it,'\u00a0Ross said. He called the inaccuracy 'the only known error in my annual report.'\"\u00a0 -- Congressional Democrats accused a senior official at the Education Department of trying to oust the agency\u2019s inspector general over her attempts to investigate Secretary Betsy DeVos. NBC News\u2019s Heidi Przybyla reports: \u201cLawmakers from four House and Senate committees who oversee the department sent a letter to DeVos on Tuesday, suggesting that the effort to replace the department\u2019s acting inspector general, Sandra Bruce, had been related to her duties in overseeing the probe of DeVos\u2019 decision to reinstate ACICS, an accreditor that had been stripped of its certification by the Obama administration.\u201d -- Sarah Isgur, Jeff Sessions\u2019s former chief spokeswoman at Justice, will join CNN as a political editor overseeing coverage of the 2020 campaign. Politico\u2019s Eliana Johnson and Michael Calderone report: \u201cIsgur joined the administration in 2017 after overcoming resistance from the president, who balked at bringing on a political operative who had trashed him on the campaign trail. As deputy campaign manager for Carly Fiorina\u2019s presidential campaign, and in the months after Fiorina bowed out of the race, Isgur repeatedly laced into Trump. \u2026 While it is common for departing administration officials to join cable news networks as analysts or contributors, it is less common for them to oversee news coverage. Isgur has no experience in news but a long history as a political operative.\u201d\u00a0CNN staffers had a generally negative reaction to the opaque process for hiring Isgur, which one employee described to the Daily Beast as \u201cextremely demoralizing.\u201d -- Former White House legislative affairs director Marc Short will serve as the vice president\u2019s new chief of staff. Josh Dawsey reports: \u201cThe hire marks the first time an aide who left the Trump White House has returned to work in a West Wing known for its chaotic environment and staff turnover. \u2026 Short left the administration last year after working as Trump\u2019s first legislative affairs director but has kept in touch with the vice president, White House officials said. \u2026 While Trump grew frustrated with Short over a spending bill last year that he signed but did not like because it did not provide the amount he wanted for his border wall, he was largely on good terms with the president and is well-liked in the administration, current and former administration officials said.\u201d -- \u201cAfter his departure, Mr. Short was occasionally blamed by name by the president for the administration\u2019s failure to secure more money to pay for a border wall, White House officials said. But that relationship has been repaired in recent weeks due in large part to Mr. Short\u2019s defense of Mr. Trump on CNN, appearances the president has kept an eye on,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Michael Bender adds. THE IMMIGRATION WARS:  -- The Trump administration canceled $929 million in federal grants for California's high-speed rail project, which Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) sees as political payback for the state leading a lawsuit to block the president's national emergency declaration. From the Los Angeles Times's Ralph Vartabedian and Matthew Ormseth: \u201cThe Transportation Department also said it was 'actively exploring every legal option' to get back an additional $2.5-billion grant that is being used to finance the construction of 119 miles of rail line in the Central Valley. The two federal grants represent about one-fourth of all the funding for the project to date \u2014 money critical to completing the Central Valley portion and finishing environmental reviews for other segments between San Francisco and Los Angeles.\u201d -- \u201cTrump insisted to reporters Tuesday afternoon that he had an \u2018absolute right\u2019 to declare an emergency and said that it is an \u2018open and closed case\u2019 that he can use the declaration to circumvent Congress to fund long-sought barriers at the border,\u201d\u00a0John Wagner reports.\u00a0\u201cTrump sounded more confident of his standing. \u2018I think in the end, we\u2019re going to be very successful with the lawsuit,\u2019 he said, adding that it\u2019s possible he might even prevail within the 9th Circuit.\u201d\u00a0 -- Senate Republicans remain divided over Trump's declaring emergency powers to build a wall: Ten\u00a0are on the record supporting it, 17 have expressed concerns, and four have spoken in opposition to the order. The other 22 GOP senators have avoided taking any public stance on it. (Kate Rabinowitz is keeping a whip count for us.) -- Border Patrol agents are growing accustomed to their new role as relief providers, as\u00a0they are often the first to meet Central American families as they arrive. CBP has\u00a0strengthened medical teams at border facilities, and agents have been stocking up on powdered milk and even offering cookies to migrant kids. Maria Sacchetti reports: \u201cThe deaths of two Guatemalan children in December and the massive groups of Central American families crossing the border are increasingly transforming the Border Patrol\u2019s role from national security to humanitarian relief. ...\u00a0Well over half the people taken into custody in recent months have been parents and children, with hundreds surrendering at a time, often in isolated locations. \u2026\u00a0 \u201cAgents say they are frustrated that parents are using children to gain entry into the United States, and they fault smugglers for taking them on risky journeys.\u00a0Agents were horrified to find a 6-year-old boy abandoned in the Arizona desert last year, in 100-degree heat. He carried a lunchbox and said he was looking for his mother in the United States. Children as young as toddlers have been heaved over high border fences to the desert sand below.\u201d Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg appears at an event\u00a0in New York. (Rebecca Gibian\/AP) THE SUPREME COURT: -- For the second time in as many weeks, Chief Justice John Roberts\u00a0sided with his liberal colleagues on how to interpret Supreme Court precedent. Robert Barnes reports: \u201cRoberts was pointed in saying the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has \u2018misapplied\u2019 a 2017 ruling that instructed that court to reconsider its analysis of whether death-row inmate Bobby James Moore was intellectually disabled, and thus ineligible for execution. Less than two weeks ago, Roberts joined the liberals in stopping a Louisiana abortion law that was nearly identical to a Texas law the court had struck down in 2016. \u2026 Roberts\u2019s role in the abortion and death penalty cases were notable partly because he had been in dissent in the original decisions.\u201d -- Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg returned to the bench for the first time since her December cancer surgery. Barnes and Mark Berman report: \u201cGinsburg, 85, was the first justice to ask a question during the oral arguments in a case centering on whether the government could be considered a \u2018person\u2019 able to challenge a patent. \u2026 For much of the time, Ginsburg remained still as her colleagues alternately leaned back in their seats, swiveled in place or rubbed their faces. Her head slightly bowed, she peered out over the court and appeared focused on the arguments. \u2026 She entered and left the courtroom without any assistance. Her appearance seemed to be the main attraction for some of the journalists who gathered into the crowded courtroom; two quickly left once she had appeared and asked her first question.\u201d -- Justice Clarence Thomas criticized New York Times v. Sullivan, the court\u2019s landmark libel ruling, as a \u201cpolicy-driven\u201d decision \u201cmasquerading as constitutional law,\u201d\u00a0somewhat echoing Trump\u2019s complaints on the issue. Barnes reports: \u201cSome media law experts expressed concern over Thomas\u2019s concern. Jonathan Peters, a professor of media law at the University of Georgia, said New York Times v. Sullivan \u2018is essential to our modern understanding of press freedom.\u2019 \u2026 But Thomas and the late Justice Antonin Scalia have said the court may have intruded into a space in which it was not needed.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0'The States are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm,\u2019\u201d\u00a0Thomas wrote. -- The high court declined to intervene in the criminal trial of former congressman Aaron\u00a0Schock\u00a0(R-Ill.) on corruption charges. Politico\u2019s Josh Gerstein reports: \u201cIn an order issued Tuesday morning, the justices rejected Schock\u2019s request that the high court hear his arguments that the case charging him with fraud, making false statements and theft of government funds unconstitutionally intrudes into the internal affairs of the legislative branch.\u201d 2020 WATCH: -- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has hired Faiz Shakir, the ACLU\u2019s national political director, as his presidential campaign manager. The Daily Beast\u2019s Gideon Resnick, Spencer Ackerman and Sam Stein report: \u201cIn hiring Shakir, Sanders brings into the fold one of the Democratic Party\u2019s better-traveled operatives\u2014an official with limited campaign experience but with ties to the party\u2019s think tank infrastructure, its Hill operations, and the larger progressive universe. \u2026 Before joining the ACLU, he was a senior adviser to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and before that he worked with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). \u2026 Shakir, 39, is almost certainly the first campaign manager of a major presidential campaign who identifies as a Muslim.\u201d -- The ACLU intends to capitalize on its expanded influence during the Trump era by hosting events for Democratic presidential candidates. HuffPost\u2019s Kevin Robillard reports: \u201cThe ACLU\u2019s revenue has doubled and its members have quadrupled since [Trump\u2019s] election. \u2026 And it will soon get more involved in the presidential contest. The ACLU wants to host debates and forums featuring the candidates in order to probe their stances on issues critical to the group, including criminal justice reform, voting rights and freedom of speech. \u2026 [The group\u2019s executive director] said that while the group won\u2019t officially endorse any candidate, he does expect some of the many Democratic hopefuls, if not most, to fall short of its standards.\u201d -- The Sanders campaign said it raised $4 million from 330,000 donors on his first day as a candidate. -- The rest of the Vermont congressional delegation \u2014 Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy and Rep. Peter Welch \u2014 endorsed Sanders\u2019s bid. Welch also supported Sanders in 2016, but Leahy endorsed Hillary Clinton that year. (VPR) -- Democrats in the 2020 field are battling two challenges simultaneously: Trump and his anti-socialist rhetoric, and an intraparty struggle to figure out how far left their policies can go. Sean Sullivan and Annie Linskey report: \u201cThe dynamic has put a squeeze on the Democratic candidates as they begin to lay out their messages. They are being pressed from one side by core Democratic voters hungry for leftist policies favored by the most energized activists and, from the other, by the need to court centrist voters who could be alienated by the party\u2019s turn to the left. \u2026\u00a0 \u201cMost of the presidential field doesn\u2019t identify as socialist. Some candidates are actively rejecting the label or putting a bit of distance between their campaigns and policies such as Medicare-for-all and the Green New Deal, which many of them support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) told reporters she is not 'a democratic socialist'\u00a0while Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said passing Medicare-for-all in the Senate would be difficult: \u2018I\u2019m not going to be one of these presidential candidates that\u2019s not going to tell you the hard truth,\u2019\u00a0Booker said.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said she\u2019s not purposely avoiding talking about the Green New Deal or Medicare-for-all: \u201cAsked how she can combat the \u2018false news going around\u2019 that equates universal health care with \u2018socialism or communism,\u2019 Warren turned the question back on Trump. \u2018We\u2019re caught in this moment where the very foundations of democracy are under attack,\u2019 Warren said. \u2018This is a scary moment for our country.\u2019 \u2026\u00a0Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) \u2026 praised the Green New Deal, which she co-sponsors, as a \u2018multifaceted approach\u2019 and argued that Democrats should embrace the difficult challenge of creating a \u2018green economy.\u2019\u201d -- Former vice president Joe Biden, who still won\u2019t say whether\u00a0he\u2019s running, took aim at Trump during a speech at the University of Pennsylvania. During a Q&A in front of hundreds of students, Biden shared his vision of reversing Trump\u2019s foreign policy and said he\u2019s now more optimistic about the country than ever, saying, \u201cIt is time to restore America\u2019s soul.\u201d (Michael Scherer) -- The self-help author Marianne Williamson has launched a long-shot bid for president based on her philosophy that Americans are responsible for ensuring the health of our democracy. Anna Peele profiles the motivational speaker: \u201cWilliamson and Trump have quite a bit in common. Both are wealthy non-politicians who sought (or seek) the presidency without previously holding public office. Both are charismatic speakers who avoid teleprompters. \u2026 Williamson says she\u2019s not actually trying to beat Trump. \u2026 Trump, she says, is \u2018simply a symptom\u2019 of a condition the other candidates aren\u2019t qualified to heal. \u2026 Williamson traces many of our nation\u2019s psychic wounds to slavery, for which she believes we need to make reparations in the form of a $100 billion, 10-year investment disseminated by a panel of black leaders across fields.\u201d -- The Trump campaign is tackling 2020 in an un-Trumpian way.\u00a0Politico's Alex Isenstadt reports: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is assembling a sprawling, corporate-style reelection campaign with 10 divisions reporting to a single senior adviser, campaign manager Brad Parscale \u2014 a top-down structure that represents everything Trump\u2019s improvisational 2016 effort was not. ...\u00a0The plan isn\u2019t without potential downsides.\u00a0With such a large payroll at such an early stage of the campaign, the campaign runs the risk of over-spending before Democrats have even picked their nominee.\u00a0...\u00a0And in another break from precedent,\u00a0the campaign, with the RNC, is planning an early and aggressive effort to brand the Democratic field as being out-of-the mainstream and socialist.\u201d -- Oregon lawmakers are pushing a bill that would\u00a0lower the voting age to 16.\u00a0From the Oregonian's Douglas Perry: \u201cYounger Oregonians should have 'a chance to participate in the ballot -- about decisions that affect their homes, their clean air, their future, their schools and, as we\u2019ve seen, their very lives,'\u00a0Democratic state Sen. Shemia Fagan said at a Monday press conference announcing the measure. Teens are 'begging us to take action to protect their future,'\u00a0she added.

(Susan Walsh\/AP) THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- Trump said he is in \u201cno rush whatsoever\u201d to see North Korea denuclearize. Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201cTrump and [Kim Jong Un] will meet on Feb. 27 and 28 in Hanoi, following on their meeting in Singapore last June. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he had a \u2018great conversation\u2019 about the trip with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Tuesday morning. Moon\u2019s administration has said it is hopeful that Trump and Kim can achieve \u2018specific\u2019 progress toward denuclearization, although some observers have voiced skepticism about the effectiveness of Trump\u2019s approach. Trump said that while he would \u2018ultimately\u2019 like to see North Korea denuclearize, he has \u2018no pressing time schedule\u2019 because \u2018the sanctions are on.\u2019\u201d -- Trump may attempt to persuade the North Korean leader\u00a0to commit to denuclearization during their second summit by promising him an announcement of peace and an end to the Korean War.\u00a0From the AP's Eric Talmadge: \u201cSuch an announcement could make history. It would be right in line with Trump\u2019s opposition to 'forever wars.' And, coming more than six decades after the fighting essentially ended, it just seems like common sense.\u00a0But, if not done carefully, it could open up a whole new set of problems for Washington. ...\u00a0If done right, it would be a huge boost to Kim\u2019s reputation at home and abroad. And, of course, to the cause of peace on the Korean Peninsula at a time when Pyongyang says it is trying to shift scarce resources away from defense ...\u00a0Washington has a lot to gain, too.\u00a0Trump has said he would welcome a North Korea that is more focused on trade and economic growth. Stability on the peninsula is good for South Korea\u2019s economy and probably for Japan\u2019s as well.\u201d -- Japan\u2019s Fukushima is getting back on its feet eight years after a nuclear meltdown, but the public\u2019s trust has not recovered. Simon Denyer reports: \u201cRadiation levels in the prefecture\u2019s capital city, Fuku\u00adshima, are comparable to the super-safe readings in places such as Hong Kong and London, monitors say. And a massive decontamination effort is still underway. But facts and spreadsheets supplied by the government are one thing. Rebuilding trust among locals may be significantly harder\u2026 at least 24 countries and territories ban some produce from Fukushima. Taiwan, South Korea and China still impose a total food ban. The United States prohibits Fukushima produce such as mushrooms, leafy vegetables and broccoli. Fishermen now only ply the seas two days a week.\u201d -- The White House is launching an effort to end the criminalization of homosexuality around the world. NBC News\u2019s Josh Lederman reports: \u201cU.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, the highest-profile openly gay person in the Trump administration, is leading the effort, which kicks off Tuesday evening in Berlin. The U.S. embassy is flying in LGBT activists from across Europe for a strategy dinner to plan to push for decriminalization in places that still outlaw homosexuality \u2014 mostly concentrated in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean. \u2026 Narrowly focused on criminalization, rather than broader LGBT issues like same-sex marriage, the campaign was conceived partly in response to the recent reported execution by hanging of a young gay man in Iran, the Trump administration\u2019s top geopolitical foe.\u201d -- Egyptian officials detained a New York Times reporter and then forced him to return to London. The Times\u2019s Declan Walsh reports: \u201cThe move against the correspondent, David D. Kirkpatrick, is an escalation of a severe crackdown against the news media under Egypt\u2019s strongman leader, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Egyptian journalists have borne the brunt of Mr. el-Sisi\u2019s repression, with dozens imprisoned or forced into exile. But of late, a lack of pushback from the United States has emboldened Egypt\u2019s security forces to take stronger action against representatives of Western news outlets, including expulsion.\u201d -- Two American women who left the country to marry Islamic State\u00a0militants want to return home after escaping the self-declared caliphate together and surrendering to American troops in the Syrian desert. From the Times\u2019s Rukmini Callimachi and Catherine Porter: \u201cBoth women \u2026 said they were trying to figure out how to have their passports reissued, and how to win the sympathy of the two nations they scorned. \u2026 In a tweet this weekend, President Trump criticized allies including Britain, France and Germany for not taking back hundreds of ISIS prisoners captured on the battlefield. \u2026 The president made no mention of American women who had married ISIS fighters and whom the United States had not returned home. Both [women] said they had not been visited by American officials since their capture last month. \u201cA small number of Americans \u2014 as few as 59, according to data tracked by the George Washington University Program on Extremism \u2014 are known to have traveled to Syria to join ISIS. Nearly all the American men captured in battle have been repatriated, but it is unclear why some of the American women and their children \u2014 at least 13 known to The Times \u2014 have not been.\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: A libertarian congressman who has previously expressed opposition to some of Trump's policies posed this question: Bernie Sanders touted his fundraising haul after he launched his second presidential campaign: A Times reporter criticized Bernie's theory of the case: An NBC News reporter shared this piece of trivia after Sanders picked up an endorsement from his fellow senator from Vermont: A Burlington Free Press editor noted that Elizabeth Warren is paying to run ads for herself when someone does a Google search for Bernie Sanders: Donald Trump Jr. suggested Sen.

By 2030, some 85 percent of extremely poor people\u2014those living on less than $1.90 a day\u2014will live in fragile settings, affected or threatened by war and other shocks. The number of armed conflicts around the world is 65 percent higher today than it was a decade ago. Many of these conflicts are civil wars, which tend to last longer than interstate wars and are much more likely to recur after a peace agreement has been reached.\u00a0As a result, displacement is lasting longer\u2014at least ten years for the average refugee. During those years, many of the displaced are unable to work or go to school. The host countries are often overburdened: almost 90 percent of the world\u2019s 24.5 million refugees live in low and middle-income countries, which already struggle to educate their populations and expand their economies. An influx of refugees can threaten tentative progress toward development. And when host countries do develop, refugees are often left behind.\u201d\u00a0 -- New York Times, \u201cHousing Is\u00a0Already in a Slump. So It (Probably) Can\u2019t Cause a Recession,\u201d by Conor Dougherty: \u201cThe gist is this: The United States may or may not enter a recession this year, but if it does, housing is unlikely to be the cause, because it never really recovered in the first place. 'Housing is not in a position to lead this thing down,'\u00a0said Edward Leamer, an economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. How much it can help prolong the overall recovery is another matter. Home sales and prices have been sluggish in the face of rising interest rates. Still, the pace of construction, combined with pent-up demand from young adults, suggests that the sector should at least remain stable in the face of uncertainty elsewhere.\u201d\u00a0 -- American Interest, \u201cThe Long Freedom Slump,\u201d by Larry Diamond: \u201cIf you look past the seven advanced industrial democracies among [the world\u2019s] 27 largest countries, you find four democracies straining under the weight of corruption and crime (Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines, and South Africa); four countries where elected leaders have stifled democratic institutions or possibilities (Russia, Turkey, Bangladesh, and Tanzania); four countries where, in different ways, the military effectively dominates (Pakistan, Thailand, Myanmar, and Egypt); three entrenched dictatorships (China, Vietnam, and Iran); three huge arenas of political pluralism (India, Indonesia, and Nigeria); one African country where the door to democratic reform seems to be closing again (the DRC); and one\u2014just one\u2014with a real but tenuous possibility of democratic progress (Ethiopia).\u201d HOT ON THE LEFT: \u201cBurberry sweatshirt featuring noose for drawstrings condemned for evoking suicide, lynching,\u201d from Reis Thebault: \u201cAnother fashion debut, another designer brand facing accusations of insensitivity. This time around, the offending label was Burberry, a company best known for its distinctive check pattern \u2014 at least, until it showed off one of its latest items at London Fashion Week on Sunday: a hooded sweatshirt that featured, instead of the usual drawstrings, a rope tied into a noose. Observers quickly condemned the sweatshirt and accused the fashion house of evoking racist lynching imagery and of being insensitive to suicide. Burberry later responded with an apology and said it was removing the sweatshirt from its collection.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT: \u201cIn blow to Obama Presidential Center backers, judge allows lawsuit challenging Chicago's Jackson Park location to proceed,\u201d from the Chicago Tribune: \u201cIn a setback to plans to build the Obama Presidential Center on Chicago\u2019s South Side lakefront, a federal judge ruled Tuesday that a lawsuit challenging its location can proceed. U.S. Judge John Robert Blakey said in a written ruling that the environmental group Protect Our Parks has enough legal ground to bring some of its objections before him. \u2026 The ruling to allow the suit to proceed is significant because it could delay construction for months, and potentially raise the question of whether the $500 million sprawling presidential campus can be built at all on lakefront property in Jackson Park.\u201d \u00a0 DAYBOOK: Trump will have lunch with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and welcome the Austrian chancellor to the White House.

Here's a look back at his long career:","43":"The Democratic presidential field keeps expanding. Not unreasonably, Democratic politicians figure their candidacies have as good a chance as anyone\u2019s to catch fire. The worst that can happen, they figure, is go back to their day jobs. From the perspective of the party and voters, however the question should be whether the 10th or 15th (or whatever) candidate adds something to the mix. In the case of Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, the answer is an emphatic yes. The first question may be: Who the heck is Steve Bullock? Iowa voters are about to find out. Politico reports, \u201cGov. Steve Bullock of Montana will travel to Iowa at the end of the week as he further explores a run for the Democratic presidential nomination, his Big Sky Values PAC told POLITICO on Tuesday.\u201d Right now he\u2019s tied up with the state legislative sessions, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s been doing nothing. \u201cEven if he publicly remains coy about his ambitions, Bullock and his team have been quietly laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign. Big Sky Values PAC, for instance, has already tapped veteran operative Megan Simpson to begin organizing in Iowa, as Iowa Starting Line first reported earlier this month.\u201d Those who know him in the party tout him as a solid retail politician with more energy and charisma than, say, low-key former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper. Why should Democrats want Bullock in the race? First, a red-state Democratic governor brings needed perspective to the race. He narrowly won in 2012 and was reelected in 2016, a horrible year for Democrats. A poll released last month showed Bullock \u201creceived the highest approval [besting two U.S. senators] ratings from Montana respondents with 60 percent of all voters strongly approving or approving of the job he is doing while 34 percent disapprove. Democrats gave him a 91 percent approval rating, while 59 percent of Republicans said they disapprove or strongly disapprove of Bullock. However, 72 percent of independent voters favor the job he is doing.\u201d (Surveys have shown him to be the most popular Democratic governor in the country.) Someone who knows how to win in a Republican state and yet keep his approval rating in his own party very high is someone Democrats should hear from. Second, Bullock presents himself as a unifying force in the party, which he says cannot merely play to coastal elites. He tells Democrats to show up everywhere and stress the bread-and-butter issues. (As Richard North Patterson put it on HuffPost: \u201cBullock\u2019s advice is typically practical and pithy: Show up. Listen as much as you talk. Emphasize pocketbook issues. Winning is not about litmus tests or micro-targeting: If you write off everyone who disagrees with you, you lose the capacity to govern. Turning out the base and persuading the unconvinced are not mutually exclusive.\u201d) Third, Bullock has accomplished progressive objectives \u2014 expanding Medicaid, investing in education, campaign finance reform, protecting the environment \u2014 and maintains his pro-choice, pro-same-sex marriage positions in a state that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump in 2016. \u201cSteve Bullock has managed not only to win elections in a red state, he passed Medicaid expansion through a very Republican legislature. That required some serious political chops,\u201d says the moderate group Third Way\u2019s Matt Bennett. \u201cHis focus will be on kitchen table issues, not faculty lounge debates. That\u2019s unlikely to make him a Twitter favorite, but it\u2019s exactly what voters want in a nominee.\u201d Fourth, with the possible exception of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), no one in the mix for 2020 talks more about the influence of \u201cdark money.\u201d He has been a staunch supporter of Montana\u2019s limits on direct campaign contributions. In 2017, after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the limits, Bullock said, \"For a century in Montana, winning an election for state office has meant going door to door and meeting face to face with everyday voters: democracy at its best. Today, we\u2019re one step closer to keeping it that way. Elections should be decided by \u2018we the people\u2019 \u2014 not by corporations, millionaires, or wealthy special interests buying more television ads.\u201d So, although Bullock lacks name recognition at this stage, there\u2019s plenty in his record for Democrats to like. \u201cGovernor Bullock has an impressive record of championing political reform and going after dark money, all while winning reelection in a state Trump won by 20 points,\u201d Neera Tanden, head of the Center for American Progress, tells me. \u201cHe will add a lot to the debates as a candidate as Democrats look for a ticket that can take on Trump., Democrats keep telling us they favor electability over ideology. If a Montana governor seems a strange solution to the party\u2019s electoral woes, consider the first post-Watergate presidential election. That race was largely about restoring trust and good government. It took a Democratic governor from a red state who emerged from a large field of candidates, Jimmy Carter, to oust Republicans from the White House. Perhaps that\u2019s a model to try again.

Probably both!","44":"There\u2019s a lot of chatter about an interview that center-left Democratic economist Brad DeLong just gave to Vox, in which DeLong argues that it\u2019s time for centrists like him to make peace with the left. The core insight that DeLong offers is that the animating idea driving many centrist Democrats for years has proved to be a failure, and as a result, it\u2019s time for them to rethink their approach to both politics and policy in accordance with this new reality. As DeLong puts it, on one issue after another \u2014 from health care to climate change \u2014 centrist-minded Democrats have modulated the party\u2019s priorities in hopes of striking a political deal with the center-right. But that deal has never been forthcoming, because there is no functional center-right in U.S. politics. DeLong notes that centrist Democrats like himself have been driven by a genuine belief in the superiority of market-oriented or (as they\u2019re sometimes called) \u201cneoliberal\u201d policies, but also a theory of political change. That theory held that striking broad bipartisan deals on policy might be worth doing, even if the result is somewhat less progressive, because it would result in them being \u201cmore strongly entrenched in America and much better implemented than if it were implemented by a narrow, largely partisan majority.\u201d But as DeLong points out, this hasn\u2019t paid off: Barack Obama rolls into office with Mitt Romney\u2019s health care policy, with John McCain\u2019s climate policy, with Bill Clinton\u2019s tax policy, and George H.W. Bush\u2019s foreign policy. He\u2019s all these things not because the technocrats in his administration think they\u2019re the best possible policies, but because [White House adviser] David Axelrod and company say they poll well. And [Chief of Staff] Rahm Emanuel and company say we\u2019ve got to build bridges to the Republicans. We\u2019ve got to let Republicans amend cap and trade up the wazoo, we\u2019ve got to let Republicans amend the [Affordable Care Act] up the wazoo before it comes up to a final vote, we\u2019ve got to tread very lightly with finance on Dodd-Frank, we have to do a very premature pivot away from recession recovery to \u201centitlement reform.\u201d All of these with the idea that you would then collect a broad political coalition behind what is, indeed, Mitt Romney\u2019s health care policy and John McCain\u2019s climate policy and George H.W. Bush\u2019s foreign policy. And did George H.W. Bush, did Mitt Romney, did John McCain say a single good word about anything Barack Obama ever did over the course of eight solid years? No, they f--king did not. \u2026 Today, there\u2019s literally nobody on the right between those frantically accommodating Donald Trump, on the one hand, and us on the other. Instead, once Republicans took total control for two years, we saw the rewards granted to Democrats for trying to be compromising. The reward for adopting Mitt Romney\u2019s health-care plan in hopes of getting bipartisan support for it was unremitting scorched-earth opposition to Obamacare, including a failed effort to repeal it entirely, which Republicans undertook while pretending they were maintaining people\u2019s protections. The reward for Obama and Democrats reaching deals to cut spending and treading lightly in response to the worst economic crisis in 70 years, and keeping full-blown economic populism at bay, was President Trump\u2019s massive deficit-exploding corporate tax cut that showered enormous benefits on top earners, which Republicans passed while pretending their plan was pro-worker. The reward for Obama and Democrats embracing market-oriented \u201ccap and trade\u201d climate policy was that Republicans blocked it with a wall of intransigence and fossil-fuel-industry-funded climate change denialism. Now Republicans are all-in with Trump\u2019s even more explicit climate denialism and a full-scale effort to roll back everything Obama did to combat global warming, including Trump pulling us out of a painstakingly negotiated international deal in a manner that is enraging our allies. I would add one more to this list: immigration. As I\u2019ve noted, on immigration, the Democratic Party for many years embraced the idea that supporting maximal enforcement would lure Republicans into supporting legalizing undocumented immigrants. But GOP intransigence has revealed this as a fantasy. After Democrats passed comprehensive immigration reform embodying that bargain through the Senate in 2013 by a broad bipartisan majority, the GOP-controlled House simply refused to vote on it. Now Republicans have gone all-in with an even more virulent form of xenophobic anti-immigrant nationalism, as well as with imaginary solutions like mass deportations and Trump\u2019s wall. So now we\u2019re seeing an increasingly emboldened left making the case for much more progressive taxation and much more aggressive efforts to rewrite the rules of the market, for dramatically ambitious health care and climate policies in the form of various iterations of Medicare for all and the Green New Deal, and for a move away from an enforcement-for-legalization paradigm on immigration, and toward a much more pro-immigration stance as a matter of basic values. And the party as a whole is much more open to these aggressive postures. It\u2019s important to stress that the party has been pushed toward these positions by grass-roots movements and by the changing nature of the Democratic base, which is more diverse, younger and better educated than it was the last time Democrats held a House majority. But another thing driving these changes is that in many of these areas \u2014 from soaring economic inequality to climate change to the need for reforms to our immigration system that don\u2019t retreat on our humanitarian commitments \u2014 there\u2019s an increased recognition that the Republican Party is basically going to sit out the process of addressing these major challenges of our time, as most Democrats understand them. This, combined with the fact that some of these challenges are simultaneously growing more urgent, is pushing Democrats toward more ambitious solutions and away from a futile, accommodationist effort to chase the mirage of consensus with the center-right.

McConnell was speaking about H.R. 1, legislation that Democrats have made a centerpiece of their agenda since retaking the House earlier this month. In remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell (R-Ky.) said Democrats \u201cwant taxpayers on the hook for generous new benefits for federal bureaucrats and government employees,\u201d including making Election Day a \u201cnew paid holiday for government workers.\u201d \u201cSo this is the Democrats\u2019 plan to \u2018restore democracy,\u2019\u201d McConnell said, describing the legislation as \u201ca political power grab that\u2019s smelling more and more like what it is.\u201d The far-reaching legislation would also prohibit the purging of voter rolls, require presidential and vice-presidential candidates to release their tax returns, compel states to adopt independent redistricting commissions and create a matching system for small-dollar donations to congressional campaigns, among other changes. In his Wednesday remarks, as well as in a Washington Post op-ed earlier this month, McConnell mocked the legislation as the \u201cDemocrat Politician Protection Act.\u201d \u201cH.R. 1 would victimize every American taxpayer by pouring their money into expensive new subsidies that don\u2019t even pass the laugh test,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor. His remarks prompted a wave of criticism by Democrats, some of whom argued that McConnell was acknowledging that Republicans want to make it more difficult for Americans to vote. \u201cVoting is a power grab. By citizens,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said in a tweet Wednesday afternoon. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) shared a link to a story about McConnell\u2019s comments and tweeted, \u201cWhy are Republicans always afraid of making it easier for Americans to vote?\u201d Ezra Levin, a former Capitol Hill staffer who co-founded the Indivisible network of liberal activist groups, accused McConnell of \u201crehearsing old lines.\u201d \u201cIn 1977, after Watergate and Nixon, Jimmy Carter was inaugurated and proposed expansive reforms to campaign finance and to make it easier to vote,\u201d Levin said on Twitter. \u201cThe GOP called it a \u2018power grab\u2019 and killed it in the Senate.\u201d Walter Shaub, a former director of the Office of Government Ethics, noted that a significant number of federal workers are military veterans and suggested combining Election Day with Veterans Day, a proposal that has made the rounds in recent years. \u201cA \u2018power grab\u2019 to let people vote?\u201d Shaub said in a tweet. \u201cHe also says it\u2019s just a holiday for bureaucrats, almost \u2153 of whom are veterans. How about McConnell compromises by moving Veterans Day to the 1st Tuesday in November? What better way to honor veterans than by making it easier for them to vote?\u201d","46":"Members of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Democratic caucus sent letters Monday requesting information from more than 80 people and organizations linked directly or tangentially to President Trump, his administration, his campaign or the Russian effort to interfere with the 2016 election\u2019s results. The list is exhaustive and contains any number of names that might not be familiar to people who aren\u2019t deeply immersed in the investigations into Trump and the campaign. Below, find all 81 targets of the letters, in alphabetical order, with explanations of who they are. Many of the documents requested from these individuals are both generic and sweeping, jumping-off points for the specific reasons why each person was probably included. Those reasons are also identified below. (Highlighted individuals themselves received letters and are included in the list.) Rinat Akhmetshin Who he is: A former Soviet military officer who now does lobbying work in the United States. During his service, his unit provided support for a military counterintelligence unit. Some officials believe he has ties to Russian intelligence, though he denies it. Why he\u2019s important: He joined his colleague Natalia Veselnitskaya, a lawyer linked to the Kremlin, at the June 9, 2016, meeting in Trump Tower predicated on providing information that would undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. The focus of the meeting instead reportedly focused on the Magnitsky Act \u2014 a law that resulted in sanctions on numerous prominent Russians. The law was a focus of the lobbying work undertaken by Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin. Akhmetshin would be able to tell investigators about what happened in the meeting and how it came to be scheduled. American Media Inc. What it is: The parent company of the tabloid newspaper National Enquirer. Why it\u2019s important: AMI has admitted to having worked with Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, on a deal meant to cover up an alleged affair involving Trump. In August 2016, former Playboy model Karen McDougal sold the rights to any story involving her having a relationship with a married man to AMI. AMI never intended to run any such story. AMI chief executive David Pecker later sought reimbursement from Cohen for the deal but was reportedly told by his attorneys that receiving such a payment would increase his exposure to criminal charges related to the payoff. Julian Assange Who he is: The founder and head of WikiLeaks. Why he\u2019s important: An indictment obtained by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III indicates that in June 2016, WikiLeaks reached out to the hackers who accessed the Democratic National Committee\u2019s network offering to host material. Assange would probably have information on those interactions and the eventual transfer of material stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. He would also be able to provide information about possible contacts with the Trump campaign or with people tangentially connected to the campaign, such as Ted Malloch. Christopher Bancroft Burnham Who he is: Burnham is the chief executive of Cambridge Global Capital (not to be confused with Cambridge Analytica). He also served on Trump\u2019s transition team. Why he\u2019s important: In addition to possible questions about his service on the transition team, Burnham was recently named to the board of En+ Group, the parent company of Russian aluminum giant Rusal. En+ was previously controlled by an oligarch named Oleg Deripaska, who employed Paul Manafort and Rick Gates before they were senior figures in Trump\u2019s campaign. The U.S. government recently lifted sanctions against En+ that were imposed after the Russian interference effort in the 2016 campaign. Stephen K. Bannon Who he is: Trump\u2019s former campaign CEO and adviser to his administration. Why he\u2019s important: Bannon could speak to a broad range of issues within the campaign and White House. Tom Barrack Who he is: Barrack is a longtime business partner of Trump\u2019s who also served as the head of Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Why he\u2019s important: There are a number of questions regarding fundraising and spending during the inaugural period about which Barrack could presumably offer information. His long history with Trump might also be of interest. He\u2019s already been interviewed by Mueller\u2019s team. Tom Bossert Who he is: Trump\u2019s former homeland security adviser. Why he\u2019s important: Bossert received an email from K.T. McFarland after she\u2019d spoken with Michael Flynn following one of Flynn\u2019s conversation with former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December 2016. During these conversations, Flynn and Kislyak discussed Russia not retaliating against sanctions imposed by Barack Obama\u2019s administration. The New York Times reported that Bossert then forwarded McFarland\u2019s email to other transition officials, including Bannon, Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer. He disputes that report. After the inauguration, Bossert was present for a number of decisions in the White House, including some related to possible sanctions. Matthew Calamari Who he is: A longtime Trump Organization staffer who served as Trump\u2019s bodyguard before being promoted to chief operating officer. Why he\u2019s important: During his testimony before the House Oversight Committee last week, Michael Cohen identified Calamari as being able to verify that Trump had inflated his assets for insurance purposes. Presumably Calamari could speak to other aspects of the Trump Organization as well. Cambridge Analytica What it is: A political data firm founded by Stephen K. Bannon and conservative donor Robert Mercer. It closed in 2018. Why it\u2019s important: The firm became a subject of international attention when it was revealed that it had exploited Facebook\u2019s terms of service to aggregate information on millions of people. The company used its data to develop profiles of voters that became central to its sales pitch. The Trump campaign hired Cambridge to help with its outreach efforts. Mueller\u2019s team has reportedly been investigating if there was data passed from the Trump campaign to Russian actors, or vice versa. There have also been questions about possible outreach from Cambridge employees to WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. Michael Caputo Who he is: A former Trump campaign staffer who had previously worked with both Paul Manafort and Roger Stone. During the 1990s, he worked in Russia. Why he\u2019s important: Caputo has also been interviewed by Mueller about his work for the Trump campaign. Michael Cohen Who he is: Trump\u2019s former personal attorney. Why he\u2019s important: As revealed during his testimony last week, Cohen has a wealth of information about the Trump campaign and the Trump Organization. Of the most immediate interest to investigators will be Cohen\u2019s involvement in a proposal to build a tower in Moscow, a project initiated by former Trump business partner Felix Sater. There\u2019s also the question of Cohen\u2019s role in the hush-money payments to Karen McDougal and adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, including the role of American Media Inc. and its CEO David Pecker. Cohen revealed last week that he had been paid by the Trump Revocable Trust. Columbus Nova What it is: A U.S. investment firm linked to a Russian company called Renova Group, which is owned by the oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. Why it\u2019s important: Columbus Nova paid Michael Cohen $500,000 for consulting help during the beginning of Trump\u2019s presidency, and its chief executive, Andrew Intrater, gave $250,000 to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. There will be questions about what, if anything, those investments returned. Concord Management and Consulting What it is: A Russian consulting company under sanction by the U.S. government. Why it\u2019s important: Concord and an affiliate company were identified in an indictment obtained by Mueller\u2019s team as having helped bankroll the alleged Russian effort to interfere with the 2016 election over social media. Mark Corallo Who he is: A former spokesman for Trump\u2019s legal team. Why he\u2019s important: Last year, it was reported that Corallo would tell Mueller about a conference call in which he participated. After Donald Trump Jr.'s initial explanation for the Trump Tower meeting \u2014 which he said was centered on adoption \u2014 Corallo reportedly was told by Trump\u2019s communications staffer Hope Hicks that the truth, as contained in emails sent by Trump Jr., would \u201cnever get out.\u201d Jerome Corsi Who he is: A conservative writer and conspiracy theorist associated with Roger Stone. Why he\u2019s important: Corsi and Stone exchanged a number of messages throughout 2016. Shortly after WikiLeaks began releasing material stolen from the DNC, Stone emailed Corsi (apparently at the behest of an official with the Trump campaign) to see whether he could figure out what else WikiLeaks had. Corsi passed the request on to Ted Malloch, later telling Stone that two more drops were expected, one in August and one in October. How Corsi might have known this and what he was told by Malloch are unclear. Corsi also claims in a book that Stone asked him to tell WikiLeaks to drop material stolen from Podesta to distract from the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape Oct. 7, 2016 \u2014 a release that occurred on that day. Randy Credico Who he is: A New York-based radio host and associate of Roger Stone. Why he\u2019s important: Like Corsi, Credico had repeated interactions with Stone related to the WikiLeaks releases. After having interviewed Julian Assange, Credico exchanged texts with Stone about what might be expected. As the Oct. 7 release approached, Corsi appears to have indicated to Stone in text messages when there were expected delays. Keith Davidson Who he is: An attorney who represented both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal as they reached hush-money agreements with American Media Inc. and Michael Cohen. Why he\u2019s important: He can provide more details about the genesis of those agreements, including the extent to which the Trump campaign was involved and if Cohen identified that the goal was to influence the election. That point is central to the determination of criminal liability. In a tweet, Davidson expressed his willingness to assist the probe. Sheri Dillon Who she is: A former attorney for Trump. Why she\u2019s important: Dillon and Stefan Passantino, at one point Trump\u2019s deputy counsel in charge of ethics, have been accused by Democrats of making false statements to the Office of Government Ethics. After it was revealed that Trump had been repaying Michael Cohen for the hush-money payment to Daniels, questions arose about his having failed to report the debt on his financial disclosure documents. Dillon\u2019s role was raised during Cohen\u2019s testimony last week. Annie Donaldson Who she is: Former chief of staff to former White House counsel Donald McGahn. Why she\u2019s important: Donaldson joined the White House in early March 2017 and would probably have been involved in or known about key moments affecting the counsel\u2019s office, such as the timeline of the firing of Michael Flynn or the push to fire former FBI director James B. Comey. She was also asked for any documents related to Trump\u2019s subsequent efforts to fire Mueller \u2014 efforts that reportedly had McGahn considering his resignation. Paul Erickson Who he is: A conservative political operative. Why he\u2019s important: Erickson had a close relationship with Maria Butina, a Russian who in December pleaded guilty to conspiracy to act as an agent of the Russian government. Butina and another Russian, Alexander Torshin, allegedly sought to build relationships with Republican officials by leveraging the National Rifle Association. Torshin at one point sought a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. The two met briefly at an NRA event in May 2016. Tony Fabrizio Who he is: A pollster who had worked for Paul Manafort and who did work for the Trump campaign. Why he\u2019s important: Fabrizio\u2019s polling appears to have ended up in the hands of Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian believed to be linked to Russian intelligence who had worked with Manafort in the past. At an Aug. 2, 2016, meeting where he was accompanied by Rick Gates, Manafort is believed to have given polling apparently conducted by Fabrizio to Kilimnik, who then reportedly passed it to two Russian oligarchs. Fabrizio could offer more information about what the polling showed. Federal Bureau of Investigation Why it\u2019s important: The FBI was asked for information on a wide range of information including Michael Flynn, the Comey firing and possible information about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian individuals. Michael Flynn Who he is: An early Trump supporter, Flynn briefly served as Trump\u2019s national security adviser. Why he\u2019s important: Flynn could speak to a range of issues. Those include a December 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in which Flynn and Jared Kushner allegedly sought to establish a communications back channel with Russia. Flynn could also speak to his conversations with Kislyak later that month related to upcoming sanctions on Russia \u2014 the issue for which he eventually lost his position with the White House after it became publicly obvious that his story about the conversation differed from Vice President Pence\u2019s. That it took so long to fire Flynn appears to be something of interest to investigators. Flynn also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in December 2015 at an event in Moscow. After leaving the White House, he attracted negative attention for his work lobbying for Turkey through his company Flynn Intel Group. Part of that work also apparently involved advocating a deal aimed at bringing nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia. A whistleblower alleged that Flynn texted about the proposed deal moving forward during Trump\u2019s inauguration. Flynn, Michael Flynn Jr. and Flynn Intel Group were also identified by Peter Smith as an ally in Smith\u2019s effort to dig up any emails that might have been hacked from Clinton\u2019s private email server. Flynn Intel Group What it is: Michael Flynn\u2019s consulting firm. Why it\u2019s important: See above. Michael Flynn Jr. Who he is: Michael Flynn\u2019s son. Why he\u2019s important: Flynn Jr. has been an outspoken defender of his father. The document request sent to Flynn Jr. covers a broad range of possible communications \u2014 including any discussion of possible pardons from Trump. Flynn Jr. was also identified by Peter Smith as connected to his effort. Frontier Services Group What it is: A company created and led by Blackwater founder Erik Prince. Why it\u2019s important: It\u2019s not immediately clear. In May, The Post reported on questions about Frontier\u2019s work, though it doesn\u2019t seem to be related to Trump. Alan Garten Who he is: Chief legal officer to the Trump Organization. Why he\u2019s important: The focus of the document requests for Garten is on payments from foreign companies to Trump Organization businesses. (Under the Constitution, there are limits on money that the president can receive from foreign entities.) Garten can also inform investigators about the proposed development of a tower in Moscow that was under discussion during the campaign. Rick Gates Who he is: Trump\u2019s former deputy campaign chairman and a member of the Trump inaugural committee. Before that, Gates worked closely with Paul Manafort. Why he\u2019s important: Gates, who\u2019s cooperating with the Mueller probe, can answer a range of questions about subjects of interest to investigators, including possible Russian contacts. He\u2019s also reported to have asked inaugural donors to pay vendors directly, sidestepping reporting requirements. General Services Administration What it is: An agency that serves as an office manager for the federal government. Why it\u2019s important: The GSA holds the lease for the building on Pennsylvania Avenue that\u2019s now operated as a hotel by the Trump Organization. As such, it can provide information about the development of that lease, information offered by the Trump Organization as the lease was under discussion and, possibly, data on foreign use of the Trump hotel property. Rob Goldstone Who he is: A music promoter who represents a Russian singer named Emin Agalarov. Why he\u2019s important: Goldstone was the person who first proposed a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-linked attorney who allegedly had information that could implicate Clinton. He pitched the meeting and helped facilitate the date and time on which it would occur in early June 2016. He ended up attending, along with Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner and Rinat Akhmetshin. J.D. Gordon Who he is: A Trump campaign staffer. Why he\u2019s important: Gordon helped lead Trump\u2019s foreign policy advisory team, two members of which \u2014 George Papadopoulos and Carter Page \u2014 had demonstrated connections to Russian actors during the campaign. Gordon was involved in discussions before the Republican convention in 2016 in which the party\u2019s position on Ukraine was changed in a way viewed as favorable to Russia. He was also close with Maria Butina, who he invited to his birthday party shortly before the election. Rhona Graff Who she is: Trump\u2019s longtime assistant and scheduler. Why she\u2019s important: Graff could provide information on a number of meetings and discussions in which Trump was involved over the 2016 election. (Trump generally worked from his Trump Organization office while running for president.) She was also identified by Michael Cohen as being likely to have important information on his conversations with Trump. Hope Hicks Who she is: A former Trump campaign and White House communications official. Why she\u2019s important: Hicks was close to many decisions made by Trump over 2016 and 2017. That includes the conversation in which Mark Corallo suggests she said that emails from Donald Trump Jr. contradicting his statement about the Trump Tower meeting would never be public. Hicks was also asked for any documents related to Michael Flynn\u2019s firing. Dylan Howard Who he is: The former editor in chief for the National Enquirer. Why he\u2019s important: Howard was identified in documents related to Michael Cohen\u2019s plea agreement as having participated in conversations related to the hush-money agreements Cohen later brokered. Those documents also indicate that both Howard and his boss, David Pecker, personally informed Cohen about the stories being pitched by McDougal and Daniels. Howard can speak not only to the genesis of those agreements but also to the extent to which they focused on the 2016 presidential campaign. Presidential Inaugural Committee What it is: The nonprofit entity that raised money for and organized Trump\u2019s inauguration. Why it\u2019s important: The committee has come under fire for its fundraising and spending. Committee documents could shed light on how money was raised, what was promised and details on where money was spent. Andrew Intrater Who he is: The founder of Columbus Nova. Why he\u2019s important: Intrater, as founder of a company linked to oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, met with Michael Cohen shortly before the 2016 election. The company later signed a contract with Cohen that paid him $500,000. Intrater himself gave $250,000 to the inaugural committee. Intrater is also Vekselberg\u2019s cousin. Department of Justice Why it\u2019s important: As with the FBI, investigators seek a wide range of documents on a number of issues. Brittany Kaiser Who she is: A former executive at Cambridge Analytica. Why she\u2019s important: Kaiser was director of business development for the company and has been asked for information related to possible contacts with Russia or with WikiLeaks. Irakly Kaveladze Who he is: The U.S. representative of the Crocus Group, the company owned by Aras Agalarov. Why he\u2019s important: Kaveladze also attended the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting organized by Rob Goldstone on behalf of Agalarov\u2019s son, Emin Agalarov. Kaveladze, like Rinat Akhmetshin and Goldstone, could discuss the content of the meeting but, as a representative of Crocus Group, might also have more information about how Agalarov came to want to organize the meeting in the first place. Jared Kushner Who he is: Trump\u2019s son-in-law. Why he\u2019s important: As with Stephen K. Bannon, the documents requested from Kushner cover a broad range of activity \u2014 as does the information he might be able to provide investigators. Kushner Companies What it is: The private company founded by Jared Kushner\u2019s father, Charles, which Jared took over in 2005. Why it\u2019s important: There have been several deals involving Kushner Cos. properties that have raised eyebrows, including a Deutsche Bank loan that came just before Election Day and links between a company that bailed out a struggling Kushner property last year and the government of Qatar. Corey Lewandowski Who he is: Trump\u2019s original campaign manager. Why he\u2019s important: Present for the first year of Trump\u2019s campaign, Lewandowski would have been privy to many of the early decision-making processes that occurred. Investigators are seeking a similarly sweeping set of documents from Lewandowski as they are Stephen K. Bannon. Ronald Lieberman Who he is: Vice president of management and development at the Trump Organization. Why he\u2019s important: Lieberman was identified by Michael Cohen during his testimony last week as being aware that Trump inflated his assets when providing information to an insurance company. Ted Malloch Who he is: A conservative writer based in Britain. Why he\u2019s important: Malloch has claimed that he was an informal adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016. More importantly, he\u2019s believed to have some connection to WikiLeaks. When Roger Stone asked Jerome Corsi to find out more information about WikiLeaks\u2019s upcoming document releases in July 2016, Corsi passed the request on to Malloch. Corsi later gave Stone information about further releases. Jason Maloni Who he is: Paul Manafort\u2019s spokesman. Why he\u2019s important: Maloni, who testified before Mueller\u2019s grand jury, was asked for a number of documents, including any documents related to a possible pardon for Manafort. The question of whether Manafort was expecting a pardon has become salient after the revelation that Manafort lied to Mueller\u2019s investigators. Paul Manafort Who he is: Former campaign chairman for the 2016 Trump campaign. Why he\u2019s important: Manafort not only led the campaign but his vast history of work for Russia-connected individuals and the various questionable actions he undertook while working for the campaign \u2014 including extending an offer for a private campaign briefing to oligarch Oleg Deripaska \u2014 also make him an important potential witness. Among other things, Manafort, if he chose to cooperate, could offer more information about the Trump Tower meeting, about the sharing of polling with Konstantin Kilimnik and about Trump\u2019s approach to or awareness of Russian interference efforts. K.T. McFarland Who she is: Former deputy national security adviser under Michael Flynn. Why she\u2019s important: Flynn and McFarland worked together closely after he was named national security adviser-designate by Trump in November 2016. The next month, Flynn called McFarland after speaking with former ambassador Kislyak. McFarland, in turn, sent an email about the call to other transition officials. \u201cIf there is a tit-for-tat escalation Trump will have difficulty improving relations with Russia,\u201d the email read, \u201cwhich has just thrown U.S.A. election to him.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what she meant by that last phrase. Donald McGahn Who he is: Former White House counsel. Why he\u2019s important: McGahn was involved in a number of key decisions in the first two years of the Trump White House, including the firings of Michael Flynn and James B. Comey and Trump\u2019s reported efforts to oust Mueller. George Nader Who he is: A businessman with ties to the United Arab Emirates. Why he\u2019s important: Nader participated in a meeting in the Seychelles during the Trump transition period in which Erik Prince had a conversation with a Russian businessman, Kirill Dmitriev, who\u2019s believed to be close to Putin. That meeting is alleged to have been a possible effort to establish a private back channel between Trump\u2019s team and Russia and was reportedly set up by the United Arab Emirates, for which Nader worked as an adviser. National Rifle Association Why it\u2019s important: There have been questions about the NRA\u2019s advocacy for Trump during 2016 for some time, centered on whether the organization accepted money from Russian interests that helped pay for its advertising. The NRA denies the allegation. It\u2019s not clear what documents were requested. Alexander Nix Who he is: Former CEO of Cambridge Analytica. Why he\u2019s important: In addition to the extant questions about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s role in the 2016 election, Nix admits to having reached out to WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign to offer to help Julian Assange\u2019s group release deleted emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server \u2014 documents that there\u2019s no evidence Assange or WikiLeaks had. Sam Nunberg Who he is: Nunberg began working as a political adviser to Trump in 2014 before being fired in July 2015. Why he\u2019s important: Nunberg had connections with a number of people central to the Trump campaign, most importantly Roger Stone. Mueller\u2019s team requested and received emails from Nunberg to a number of campaign officials on this list. Carter Page Who he is: A former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. Why he\u2019s important: Page was first interviewed by the FBI in 2013 after a suspected Russian agent identified him as a target for recruitment. In July 2016, while working for the campaign, he traveled to Moscow, where he met with a deputy prime minister who, he said in an email back to the campaign, had expressed support for Trump\u2019s candidacy. The dossier of reports alleging collusion between the campaign and Russia written by former British intelligence official Christopher Steele alleged deeper ties between Page and Russian actors. In October 2016, after leaving the campaign, Page was the target of a surveillance warrant by the FBI. Page, like J.D. Gordon, was asked to provide documents related to the change in the Republican platform. George Papadopoulos Who he is: A former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. Why he\u2019s important: Papadopoulos triggered the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation when he told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that he\u2019d been informed that Russia had thousands of emails compromising Clinton. That information had been given to him by a Russia-linked professor based in Britain. Brad Parscale Who he is: Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign data chief and 2020 campaign manager. Why he\u2019s important: Parscale, as one of the senior officials in the Trump campaign, was asked for a range of documents. Most central to the investigation, though, is the request for documents about \u201c[d]iscussions or attempts to provide or receive election information, campaign data, or campaign communications with, to, or from foreign entities or individuals in connection with the 2016 U.S. Presidential primary or general elections.\u201d It\u2019s been reported that Mueller is looking at whether the campaign and Russian actors shared data. The question above gets to that directly. (Interestingly, Parscale wasn\u2019t asked for any documents about Cambridge Analytica specifically, though the section above may get at related questions.) Stefan Passantino Who he is: Former deputy White House counsel in charge of ethics. Why he\u2019s important: Passantino and Sheri Dillon have been accused by Democrats of making false statements to the Office of Government Ethics. After it was revealed that Trump had been repaying Michael Cohen for the hush-money payment to Daniels, questions arose about his having failed to report the debt on his financial disclosure documents. David Pecker Who he is: CEO of American Media Inc. Why he\u2019s important: Pecker was involved in discussions centered on the hush-money payment made to Karen McDougal in August 2016, a payment allegedly made in coordination with Michael Cohen and Trump. Pecker expected to be repaid by Trump but later rescinded that request, apparently after his attorneys suggested that it might further implicate him in campaign finance crimes. A document filed as part of Cohen\u2019s plea agreement indicates that both Pecker and the National Enquirer\u2019s editor in chief, Dylan Howard, personally informed Cohen about the stories being pitched by McDougal and Daniels. That probably stemmed from a meeting in August 2015 where Pecker told Cohen and another person \u2014 probably Trump \u2014 that AMI would help kill stories detrimental to Trump\u2019s candidacy. Reince Priebus Who he is: Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff. Why he\u2019s important: Priebus led Trump\u2019s staff during the period in which both Michael Flynn and James B. Comey were fired. He was also part of the transition team and received the email about Flynn\u2019s conversations with the Russian ambassador. Erik Prince Who he is: The founder of Frontier Services Group and brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Why he\u2019s important: Prince met with Kirill Dmitriev, a Russian businessman believed to be close to Putin, in the Seychelles in early 2017. The meeting was alleged to have been a possible effort to establish a back channel with the Russian government, an allegation Prince denies. Prince says he was invited to the meeting by Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan Who he is: The crown prince of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Why he\u2019s important: Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan encouraged Erik Prince to meet with a connected Russian businessman shortly before the inauguration in 2017 but, a few weeks earlier, had a secret meeting at Trump Tower with Jared Kushner, Michael Flynn and Stephen K. Bannon. The Seychelles meeting involving Prince was allegedly intended to set up a back channel with Russia \u2014 also the alleged goal of a Trump Tower meeting in early December 2016 involving Kushner, Flynn and the Russian ambassador. Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust What it is: The business entity created to distance Trump from the day-to-day workings of the Trump Organization. Why it\u2019s important: The trust was the source of payments reimbursing Michael Cohen for the hush money he paid Stormy Daniels shortly before the election. Documents related to those payments were requested from the trust, as were any documents that might suggest foreign payments to the Trump Organization. Anatoli Samochornov Who he is: A translator who once contracted with the State Department. Why he\u2019s important: Samochornov joined the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016, which was also attended by Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner and Rinat Akhmetshin. He could potentially offer more information about that conversation. Felix Sater Who he is: A longtime business partner of Trump\u2019s who pitched Michael Cohen on the proposal for a development in Moscow. Why he\u2019s important: Sater, who in the past has worked as an informant for the federal government, was integral to the Moscow proposal. He could provide investigators with information about the duration of conversations about the project as well as what he had learned from both Cohen and Russian officials about how the proposal was progressing. For example, Cohen had a conversation with an assistant to Putin\u2019s spokesman on Jan. 20, 2016. The next day, Sater informed Cohen that he\u2019d gotten a call from Putin\u2019s office. The content of that call isn\u2019t known. Sater also worked on the project with a former general in the Russian intelligence agency. SCL Group Limited What it is: The parent company of Cambridge Analytica. Why it\u2019s important: As with the various former Cambridge staffers on this list \u2014 Alexander Nix, Julian David Wheatland and Brittany Kaiser \u2014 investigators are seeking information about possible data links to Russia. One noteworthy detail is the request from those individuals (and many others) for \u201c[a]ny contacts, direct or indirect, from\u202fJanuary 1, 2016 to the present between Paul Manafort and\/or Rick Gates and any of the following individuals: Konstantin Kilimnik, Serhiy Lyovochkin, and\/or Rinat Akhmetov.\u201d That\u2019s a reference to the polling information shared by Manafort with Kilimnik, which he passed on to the oligarchs Lyovochkin and Akhmetov (not to be confused with Rinat Akhmetshin). Jay Sekulow Who he is: Attorney for President Trump. Why he\u2019s important: Sekulow, like Donald McGahn, was asked for a broad range of information related to the Trump administration. He would have access to a great deal of information about Trump and the presidency, but it\u2019s unlikely he would or could provide it. Jeff Sessions Who he is: Trump\u2019s former attorney general. Why he\u2019s important: Sessions could provide investigators with information about the firing of James B. Comey as well as Comey\u2019s descriptions of his interactions with Trump, which he indicates he often shared with Sessions. He could also corroborate reports that Trump sought to fire Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. Among the other documents requested from Sessions were any that related to possible pardons for Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn or Michael Cohen. Estate of Peter Smith What it is: The documents and material left behind by Peter Smith, a Republican activist. Why it\u2019s important: The Wall Street Journal reported that Smith had undertaken an effort to dig up emails from Clinton\u2019s private email server that may have been stolen by hackers. (There\u2019s no evidence that they were.) In late 2015, he met with Michael Flynn, before Flynn began working for the Trump campaign, and claimed broader connections to the Trump campaign. He worked with a small team, including John Szobocsan. Smith is believed to have killed himself shortly after the Journal\u2019s first report about his efforts was made public, \u201cweeks after telling friends that he believed he had finally obtained the missing emails, according to a person familiar with the matter.\u201d Part of Smith\u2019s effort involved asking experts such as Matt Tait to verify material he had acquired. Sean Spicer Who he is: Trump\u2019s former press secretary. Why he\u2019s important: Spicer\u2019s tenure at the White House overlapped with the firings of Michael Flynn and James B. Comey. In particular, though, Spicer\u2019s representations of the Flynn firing during a Feb. 14, 2017, news briefing seem to have captured investigators\u2019 interest. Roger Stone Who he is: A longtime aide to Trump. Why he\u2019s important: Stone repeatedly alleged connections to WikiLeaks during the campaign. Last week, Michael Cohen testified that he was present for one of the first times Stone did so: an alleged call to Trump in July 2016 predicting the imminent release of emails by WikiLeaks. It\u2019s not clear how he might have known this, but a campaign official soon asked Stone to see what else WikiLeaks had. Stone emailed Jerome Corsi, who passed on the request to Ted Malloch. After Randy Credico interviewed Julian Assange in August 2016, Stone began texting with him and making public predictions about WikiLeaks\u2019s plans based on that information. Stone did have direct contact with WikiLeaks \u2014 centered on WikiLeaks\u2019s insistence that he stop claiming that he had spoken with them. John Szobocsan Who he is: A partner of Peter Smith\u2019s. Why he\u2019s important: Szobocsan worked with Smith on his effort to uncover emails stolen from Clinton\u2019s private email server. He has been interviewed by Mueller\u2019s team multiple times. Matt Tait Who he is: A former British spy who was among the first to connect Russia to material stolen from the DNC. Why he\u2019s important: Tait was contacted by Peter Smith and asked to help verify material that Smith had obtained that he believed might have been emails hacked from Clinton\u2019s private email server. When Tait suggested that the hackers who had provided Smith with the material might be Russian \u2014 if it was authentic at all \u2014 he indicates that Smith didn\u2019t seem to care. Tait spoke with both Smith and John Szobocsan by phone but never saw the allegedly hacked material. Eric Trump Who he is: Trump\u2019s son and a senior campaign adviser. Why he\u2019s important: Eric Trump wasn\u2019t as centrally involved in many of the questionable issues as Donald Trump Jr., but investigators are still seeking a broad range of possible documents related to his awareness of issues included in this article. The Trump campaign Why it\u2019s important: The campaign has been asked for a range of documents related to individuals on the list. Among them are any documents related to Michael Cohen\u2019s payment to Stormy Daniels \u2014 a payment that he and federal prosecutors allege was related to the campaign. Donald Trump Jr. Who he is: Trump\u2019s son and a senior campaign adviser. Why he\u2019s important: Last March, we outlined the various reasons it was strange that Trump Jr. hadn\u2019t yet talked to Mueller. The list is now longer: His involvement in the genesis of the Trump Tower meeting, his efforts to cover that meeting up, questions about his having told Trump about the meeting, his knowledge of the Trump Organization\u2019s business in Russia and his involvement in the Moscow project with Michael Cohen. The documents requested by investigators cover nearly every subject on this list, presumably under the assumption that Trump Jr. and Trump would have had conversations about many of them. Trump Foundation What it is: Trump\u2019s defunct private charity. Why it\u2019s important: The charity for years was involved in questionable activity, as The Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold has documented. Specifically, though, Trump is alleged to have used the charity to bolster his 2016 campaign. At one point, Allen Weisselberg allegedly contacted Corey Lewandowski \u2014 Trump\u2019s campaign manager \u2014 to ask how charitable donations could be distributed to benefit the campaign. Trump Organization What it is: Trump\u2019s private business. Why it\u2019s important: For a variety of reasons. Questions about Trump\u2019s past business relationships have swirled since he began running for office, questions that remain in part because of the president\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns. Among the documents sought by investigators are ones related to Michael Cohen\u2019s payment to Stormy Daniels and the way in which he was repaid. Trump transition team What it is: The group of advisers who worked on ensuring that Trump was prepared to assume control of the government. Why it\u2019s important: Among other documents, investigators are seeking information about Michael Cohen\u2019s contract work during the period between the election and the inauguration. There have been questions raised about how Cohen might have tried to deliver for his consulting clients, which such documents might help answer. Viktor Vekselberg Who he is: A Russian oligarch who runs the Renova Group. Why he\u2019s important: A firm linked to Renova, Columbus Nova, hired Michael Cohen to act as a consultant for the first half of 2017. Vekselberg also attended Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 and was at the December 2015 dinner where Michael Flynn met Putin. Allen Weisselberg Who he is: Chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. Why he\u2019s important: Weisselberg first popped up in the Russia investigation when it was revealed that he was providing information to federal investigators about the hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. During his testimony last week, Michael Cohen identified Weisselberg as a source of information about the specifics of those agreements. In fact, Cohen recommended investigators talk to Weisselberg about a wide range of subjects. As CFO of the private Trump Organization, he could offer insight into a number of different areas. Included in the document requests was any information about foreign payments coming into the Trump Organization since Trump\u2019s inauguration, documents related to the proposed Moscow deal and information about any Russian money coming into the Trump Organization. Weisselberg was also involved in the Trump Foundation, at one point allegedly contacting Corey Lewandowski \u2014 Trump\u2019s campaign manager \u2014 to ask how charitable donations could be distributed to benefit the campaign. Julian David Wheatland Who he is: Cambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO until its dissolution and the chairman of SCL Group, the predecessor to Cambridge. Why he\u2019s important: As with Alexander Nix and Brittany Kaiser, Wheatland was asked for information about possible contacts with Russia or WikiLeaks. White House Why it\u2019s important: Documents sought by investigators cover a broad range of the issues on this list. WikiLeaks What it is: An organization that publishes material often obtained from government agencies. Why it\u2019s important: WikiLeaks obtained material stolen from the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and, at some point that same year, data stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The material is believed to have been stolen by hackers linked to Russian intelligence. During the campaign, Roger Stone repeatedly claimed to have contact with WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange, which WikiLeaks denied. (Stone did seem to have information about upcoming releases that suggested some connection.) Late in the campaign, WikiLeaks also reached out to Donald Trump Jr. over Twitter, though nothing significant appears to have been shared.","47":"UNITED NATIONS \u2014 The head of the U.N. women\u2019s agency is calling for the revolution in technology to be used to benefit the world\u2019s poor, and especially women, who will not achieve gender equality without \u201cthe giant leap that 21st century innovations can bring.\u201d Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said in an interview and a speech ahead of the Commission on the Status of Women\u2019s annual meeting starting Monday that sanitation, clean water, good roads, affordable internet service and use of mobile phones to transfer money and pay bills are critical to changing women\u2019s lives. \u201cWe have made progress toward gender equality. We have more women in significant roles, but we\u2019re still leaving many, many more women behind,\u201d the executive director of UN Women said. \u201cSometimes we even lose the gains that we\u2019ve already made. And that is why we are emphasizing the importance of innovation and technology.\u201d Mlambo-Ngcuka stressed that \u201cthe 21st century is about large ideas, scale and speed.\u201d If technology and innovation aren\u2019t used to promote equality for women from agriculture and education to finance and health, she said, the \u201cFourth Industrial Revolution\u201d of rapid technological change will happen \u201cand the women will still be living in the previous industrial revolution, which also did not work for them very well.\u201d Mlambo-Ngcuka said, \u201cThe good news is that for many of the problems we have today there are solutions that we know about.\u201d She pointed to affordable internet service and the use of \u201cmobile money\u201d through mobile phones that is changing the lives of women in Kenya in the same way that microcredit \u2014 small loans \u2014 has enabled hundreds of thousands of women in developing countries to start businesses. In some countries, \u201cmobile money\u201d can be used to pay for the delivery of water or buying energy, \u201cso it\u2019s not a luxury to have that kind of infrastructure,\u201d Mlambo-Ngcuka said. \u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer. It changes for better the GDP of countries.\u201d She noted that 80 percent of women in low-income and middle-income countries own mobile phones and \u201cit would be a historic mistake to fail to make deliberate use of these technologies to advance gender equality.\u201d Mlambo-Ngcuka said improving infrastructure to provide clean water means that girls don\u2019t have to walk miles to get water from a river and boil it. In her native South Africa, she said, \u201cproviding free water, electricity and social protection for the poor has meant more children go to school and stay in school, and parents are able to have a decent life and reduce malnutrition.\u201d In Rwanda, Mlambo-Ngcuka said, drones are being used to deliver medicine to rural areas, and in West Africa, drones are being used to oversee fields and sprinkle organic material to kill pests. And she said blockchain technology \u2014 storing digital information about transactions in a public database \u2014 can be used to deliver services to displaced people. But Mlambo-Ngcuka said, \u201cThe bad news is that even though there are solutions, they are not being taken into account fully, even where it reduces the cost.\u201d She said the biggest challenge in implementing the U.N. goal of achieving gender equality by 2030 is the need to accelerate the pace and scale-up action. Infrastructure is one of the barriers, which she said is why it is a key focus of this year\u2019s two-week meeting of the Commission on the Status of Women. The debate on the commission\u2019s final document is still underway, and Mlambo-Ngcuka said among the issues still being discussed are the affordability of infrastructure projects and how can they be financed, and the transfer of technology so that those in relatively agrarian countries can leapfrog to the internet era. \u201cSome countries think water is more important than broadband\u201d high-speed internet access, \u201cbut you actually need both,\u201d she said. When it comes to infrastructure for health care, Mlambo-Ngcuka said, some countries \u201cdon\u2019t want it to benefit sexual and reproductive rights,\u201d which are part of the 1995 platform for action to achieve gender equality adopted by the world\u2019s nations at the U.N. women\u2019s conference in Beijing. \u201cSome countries don\u2019t want to use the word gender \u2014 you must always say men and women, so that you do not include people who are gender non-conforming,\u201d she said. Another challenge is ending violence against women, she said. The #MeToo movement has helped expose the widespread prevalence of sexual harassment and abuse and shown that there are consequences, she said, and it has led to changes in some organizations and institution. Mlambo-Ngcuka said it has been the technology of social media that has given women a platform to speak out against sexual harassment and sexual misconduct. But she said greater efforts are needed to change bad laws and implement good laws against sexual harassment, abuse and domestic violence. Looking to the future, Mlambo-Ngcuka said the world must not accept that it will take more than 200 years to achieve gender equality at the current pace. That means \u201conly the grandchildren of the grandchildren of the grandchildren will achieve gender equality,\u201d she said, which is unacceptable. \u201cWithout intentional action, this continued slow pace is a real risk.\u201d","48":"The Internet as we know it began with cats: Their keyboards, their rainbows, those pearly black eyes. Cats are the Internet. So while videos of cats on YouTube are not a new concept, cooking with them might be. Popular YouTube channel JunsKitchen stars three house cats \u2014 Kohaku, Poki and Nagi \u2014 who watch as their owner Jun Yoshizuki prepares classic Japanese staples such as omurice, ramen and tofu. JunsKitchen is one of four YouTube channels run by Yoshizuki, 29, and his wife, Rachel, 30. While most of their channels focus on their life and travels in Japan, JunsKitchen features basic cooking tutorials. But what makes these special, and popular with fans, is the soothing atmosphere Jun creates with meticulously edited videos. He posted just seven videos to the channel last year. \u201cAs someone who suffers from depression and anxiety; Rachel and Jun\u2019s videos have become a form of meditation for me,\u201d one user wrote on Reddit. \u201cIf you ever are feeling overwhelmed, I highly recommend shutting down your brain for a few [minutes] and watching some of their videos.\u201d Millions of people are doing just that. Each of the channel\u2019s 25 videos have more than 1 million views. The most popular, with more than 37 million views, is a tutorial on polishing a rusty knife. In it, Jun spins a charming tale of purchasing a banged up traditional Japanese knife from a man in a recycling store who may or may not have conned him. As his cats look on and an upbeat rock song plays, Jun polishes the knife until it gleams. The moment he holds the restored knife and demonstrates its sharpness is triumphant. A cat looks on seemingly with awe as Jun carves a radish rose. \u201cAs soon as people got a hold of \u2018cat watching man cook,\u2019 people started sharing his videos everywhere,\u201d Rachel said. Rachel and Jun already had a loyal community of followers before they started focusing on JunsKitchen. They\u2019ve been on YouTube for seven years and started their first channel, Rachel and Jun, as a hobby while they were in a long-distance relationship. They both live in the Japan\u2019s Fukuoka prefecture and generally post videos of life in Japan for English-speaking viewers \u2014 like an idiot\u2019s guide to Japanese apartments or a trip to a Fox Village in Japan. JunsKitchen surpassed that \u201cmain\u201d channel in subscribers a little more than a year ago. Their three cats are essentially characters in the videos, with their own personalities. You\u2019ll most likely find Kohaku in frame while Jun\u2019s cooking \u2014 on the fridge or in a chair alongside Nagi. Jun often passes ingredients to them for inspection as he makes a meal, especially if it\u2019s a piece of fish or a can of tuna. Watching Kohaku watch Jun, it\u2019s easy to graft emotions and coy facial expressions. The comments are littered with musings on the cats\u2019 moods. To capture these magical moments, Rachel and Jun say it takes countless hours of editing before they hit publish. It may take Jun 40 minutes without filming to make sushi \u2026 for the cats. (And, yes, there\u2019s a video of sushi for the cats.) YouTube is pretty much a full-time job at the moment. Jun said he has a \u201cside-job\u201d as a translator. They have T-shirts for fans and a Patreon with 1,200 supporters at the time this article published. There\u2019s also dedicated community on Discord, a chat app for online gaming, where their supporters talk about their own cats, the latest video from Rachel and Jun, or their hobbies: cooking, gaming, even book recommendations. Eric Colwell, 24, a chat moderator for their community on Discord, found JunsKitchen a few years ago. For him, the cooking tutorials are relaxing, and he said he would rather Jun share a video every few months than the weekly vlogs you see from other YouTubers. \u201cIt shows that they really love them and care about [the videos],\u201d Colwell said. Videos often start with getting ingredients. Japanese dishes tend to depend on seasonal ingredients, Jun said, and it\u2019s an opportunity to show the countryside of Japan. Jun is from Aichi prefecture, and his grandparents and extended family were farmers. For Jun, there\u2019s something \u201cmore interesting and attractive\u201d filming those wider expanses than Tokyo or another urban sprawl. \u201cThe food that\u2019s in season tastes the best,\u201d Jun said. In one video, Jun goes to a mushroom farm before making sukiyaki \u2014 a traditional Japanese dish \u2014 back at his apartment. Jun shows details that you wouldn\u2019t see shopping at a supermarket, and he said he has an appreciation for the time spent and a curiosity for how dishes are made. Rachel said if there\u2019s a spot at a restaurant where you can see the chefs preparing the food, \u201cJun wants to sit there\u201d and he\u2019ll often ask the chef how certain parts of a meal were made. In the videos, the camera never focuses on Jun, just the food and his cats. Those are the stars. \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself a chef or talented or skillful or anything,\u201d Jun said.","49":"THE PROGNOSIS Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar speaks during a Senate Finance Committee hearing in June. (Jacquelyn Martin\/AP) As usual, there is plenty Democrats hate in President Trump\u2019s budget request, but this year the proposal\u00a0contains something that might bring them\u00a0to the table: a large infusion of funding to end HIV transmissions in the United States. Trump \u2014 who last month pledged to end the HIV epidemic in this country by 2030 \u2014 asked Congress for $291 million in mostly new funding for the ambitious project in the budget request the White House released yesterday. The funding, about half of it flowing through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, would be targeted toward\u00a048 counties and the rural areas of seven (mostly southern) states where more than 50 percent of new HIV cases are diagnosed. \u201cIn many of these places, it is hard for people at risk of contracting HIV to find the medication critical to protecting them from the virus and ending the 38-year-old epidemic,\u201d my Washington Post colleague Lena H. Sun writes. \u201cThe CDC estimates that the decline in HIV infections has stalled because effective prevention and treatment are not reaching those who could most benefit.\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar heads to Capitol Hill over the next three days for a trio of hearings on the budget request. There, he\u2019ll probably ask lawmakers to grant the additional dollars even as he faces probing questions from Democrats on a host of other issues, including HHS\u2019s efforts to lower prescription drug costs and its role in migrant family separations. Today,\u00a0Azar will appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and on Thursday he\u2019ll visit the Senate Finance Committee. Tomorrow, he\u2019ll sit before the House Appropriations Health subcommittee, where Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) holds the key to the HIV funding Trump wants. While the Democratic-led House won\u2019t pass the vast majority of the items requested by the president, the HIV project is an area of bipartisan concern and one that DeLauro may act upon when it comes time to appropriate money to keep the government running. DeLauro said that while she\u2019s \u201cencouraged\u201d by the HIV initiative, she\u2019s also concerned the administration\u2019s proposed cuts to other health programs, including Medicaid, would counteract the effort. \u201cI am concerned that the president\u2019s proposed cuts to the National Institutes of Health\u2019s HIV research portfolio, along with deep cuts to Medicaid and the proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act, would be counterproductive to the goal of reducing HIV infections,\u201d DeLauro said in a statement to The Health 202. \u201cWe cannot allow mixed signals on this important issue.\u201d Many Democrats and health-care advocates echoed similar feelings that Trump was sending mixed signals with his budget request. Even as the president proposed more money aimed at domestic HIV transmissions, his 2020 budget retains prior proposals to slash global HIV\/AIDS dollars, stem Medicaid spending by transforming it into a block grant program and cut the National Institutes of Health budget. The budget also envisions a leaner HHS, proposing to slash its discretionary funding by 12 percent, down to $87.1 billion annually. \u201cCongress will forget this budget by Friday, but the signal it sends to the world\u2019s poorest will be remembered,\" said Tom Hart, North America executive director for the ONE Campaign. \"It\u2019s pretty simple \u2014 we can\u2019t end the AIDS crisis by cutting programs proven to fight this disease.\u201d Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute, told me he\u2019s frustrated by those proposed cuts. But he\u2019s focusing on what would be a historical investment in ending HIV transmissions if Congress funded the project. Of the $291 million requested in Trump's\u00a0budget, the CDC would get $140 million in entirely new funding \u2014 an 18 percent increase over the agency\u2019s current budget. Another $70 billion would go to the Ryan White program, which provides care to low-income patients who are HIV-positive, and the Indian Health Service would get $25 million to screen for HIV and prevent and treat Hepatitis C. Community health centers would use $50 million to provide PrEP, a drug that greatly reduces the chances of acquiring HIV, and NIH would use $6 million for AIDS research \u2013 although it\u2019s not clear from the budget documents released yesterday whether those would be new or just reallocated funds. The White House is expected to release additional budget details early next week. Jen Kates,\u00a0vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the\u00a0Kaiser Family Foundation: Schmid said he hopes only new dollars would be used for the HIV project\u00a0so that other priorities don\u2019t lose funding. But overall, he\u2019s thrilled the administration is putting a sharp focus on HIV\/AIDS \u2014 a public health\u00a0issue that has historically brought lawmakers together. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Democrats wouldn\u2019t be supportive of it,\u201d Schmid said. \u201cThey\u2019ve always wanted more funding for HIV, and this gives them an opportunity.\u201d The administration\u2019s goal is to reduce HIV transmission by 75 percent within five years and by at least 90 percent by 2030. That would prevent 250,000 new infections, my colleague Lena noted. \u201cA recent report from the CDC shows the significant decline in annual HIV infections has stalled,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe report provides the most recent data on HIV trends in the United States, from 2010 to 2016. It shows that after about five years of substantial declines, the number of HIV infections began to level off in 2013 at about 39,000 per year.\u201d In most of the Deep South, it's\u00a0difficult for people at risk of contracting HIV to find the medication critical to protecting themselves from the virus, my\u00a0colleague Lenny Bernstein reports. Use of PrEP is rising nationwide\u00a0but lagging in the South, Lenny\u00a0reports. In 2017, there were about 20,000 new HIV diagnoses in the South, more than in the rest of the country combined. Researchers at Emory University\u2019s Rollins School of Public Health found the 2017 ratio of PrEP use to need\u00a0 was more than three times higher in the Northeast than\u00a0in the South. Azar called the project \u201cone of the most important public health initiatives undertaken this century.\u201d Here are more highlights of some of the health-care related issues addressed in\u00a0the\u00a0budget request:\u00a0 \u2014 Major cuts to health programs for the poor, elderly and disabled: Trump\u2019s budget includes a marked slowdown in Medicaid spending, with a $1.5 trillion cut to Medicaid over a decade, and\u00a0$1.2 trillion added for a block grant\u00a0system,\u00a0our Post colleagues Jeff Stein and Amy Goldstein report. The proposal shifts Medicaid into a system of block grants to states to\u00a0give them flexibility in\u00a0setting\u00a0their own rules about how to cover people. \u201cThe budget also would eliminate funding for Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which has gone to about three dozen states over the past five years,\u201d they write. Despite the president\u2019s vows to protect Medicare funding, Trump's budget also calls for a marked cut for the federal health program for seniors \u2014 $845 billion over the next 10 years. Most of the cuts are related to \u201cchanging payments to doctors and hospitals, and renewed efforts to ferret out fraudulent and wasteful billing \u2014 oft-cited targets by presidents of both parties.\u201d \u2014 Cuts and adds to cancer funding: The budget proposes\u00a0a $50 million boost for pediatric cancer research while at the same time cutting the total funding for the National Cancer Institute by almost $900 million. \u201cThe budget said the childhood cancer request was the first step in investing $500 million over the next 10 years, something President Trump called for last month in his State of the Union address,\u201d our Post colleague Laurie McGinley\u00a0writes. \u201cCancer researchers and advocates said that the net effect of cutting about 14.5 percent from the cancer institute budget, even while adding the money for pediatric research, would hurt children and adults. They called on Congress to rebuff the cuts \u2014 as lawmakers have in the past few years.\u201d \u2014 Reduced NIH funding overall: The proposal includes a roughly $4.5 billion cut to NIH\u2019s budget. The biggest cuts there would include dropping the NCI from $6.1 billion to $5.2 billion;\u00a0and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases budget from $5.5 billion to $4.75 billion, our Post colleagues Joel Achenbach, Ben Guarino, Sarah Kaplan and Brady Dennis write. \u2014Funding for a small children's health program requested by golfing champion Jack Nicklaus, one of Trump's golfing buddies. As Politico's Dan Diamond notes, the HHS budget would provide\u00a0$20 million for\u00a0a mobile children's hospital project at Miami's Nicklaus Children's Hospital. \"Nicklaus had lobbied Trump on the golf course in Florida, and\u00a0he met\u00a0with HHS Secretary Alex Azar and then-OMB Director Mick Mulvaney in Washington, D.C., to request funds, say two individuals with knowledge,\" Dan writes.\u00a0\"Trump personally directed HHS to earmark the funds to help Nicklaus develop mobile children's hospitals, one individual said.\" \u2014 More Food and Drug Administration\u00a0funding: The administration is asking for $6.1 billion in funding for the agency, which is a $418.5 million increase over the current budget. \u2014 A crackdown on e-cigarettes: The request includes a user-fee proposal\u00a0requiring\u00a0the e-cigarette industry to pay $100 million a year as part of the effort to combat youth vaping. Currently, other tobacco products like\u00a0cigarettes and cigars are subject to such fees. The funds would go to boosting the FDA\u2019s regulatory oversight,\u00a0Laurie reports. The\u00a0proposal says the user fee \u201cwould ensure that FDA has the resources to address today\u2019s alarming rise in youth e-cigarette use as well as new public health threats of tomorrow. New tobacco or nicotine products that are regulated by FDA should also pay a user fee, just as other tobacco related products that are subject to FDA\u2019s user fee.\u201d \u2014 Slashing drug\u00a0costs: There's also a proposal to cap out-of-pocket prescription costs for seniors under Medicare, an idea the administration has proposed before. The budget calls for\u00a0limiting the amount\u00a0Medicare beneficiaries pay for medicine, \u201cproviding financial certainty to both patients and drug manufacturers while leaving the government to pick up the tab for anything seniors spend on drugs past a certain threshold,\u201d Stat\u2019s Lev Facher writes. But the budget would also get rid of some \u00a0help Medicare beneficiaries receive to pay for their drugs, CNBC\u2019s Sarah O\u2019Brien reports. The proposal would slash cost-sharing that helps low-income patients\u00a0pay for generic drugs\u00a0and also stops allowing drug manufacturer discounts to count toward out-of-pocket costs in Medicare Part D\u2019s coverage gap. \u2014 More for opioid crisis:\u00a0\u201cThe budget plan does propose some new funding to fight the opioid crisis, including $245 million over 10 years to let states \u2018extend Medicaid coverage for pregnant women with substance use disorder to one year postpartum,\u2019\u201d Vox\u2019s German Lopez reports. \u201cBut it also proposes cuts to some opioid-related programs, particularly at the Department of Justice \u2026 It\u2019s also far short of the tens of billions of additional dollars that experts say is needed to address the opioid crisis.\u201d \u2014 Boost for spending on veterans: Trump's request\u00a0would increase the budget at the Department of Veterans Affairs by about 7.5 percent. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Ben Kesling reports\u00a0the\u00a0increase includes 10 percent more for medical care, providing \"$8.9 billion to implement a sweeping law passed in 2018 to change the way veterans\u2019 health care is provided and streamlining access to private-sector care.\u201d\u00a0 The department would also get\u00a0$1.6 billion to establish a new electronic health-records system. See more here from our colleagues\u00a0on what's in the president's 2020 budget request:\u00a0 AHH: Today, major health\u00a0insurer UnitedHealthcare and its pharmacy benefit manager, OptumRx, will announce the expansion of a\u00a0program in which\u00a0customers directly receive the discounts provided by drugmakers. Starting in January, all of UnitedHealthcare's employer-sponsored health-care plans\u00a0must pass along point-of-sale rebates\u00a0directly to consumers.\u00a0UnitedHealthcare says\u00a0its initial direct-rebate program, started\u00a0last year, has lowered drug costs by an average of $130 per prescription. The rebates drug companies give to insurers have increasingly come under fire from the Trump administration and lawmakers, who blame them for incentivizing the pharmaceutical industry to push list prices higher. In turn, drugmakers blame insurers for not passings on to consumers the savings from the rebates. A Medicare-for-all placard on Capitol Hill. (JIM WATSON \/ AFP)JIM WATSON\/AFP\/Getty Images) OOF: The cuts to Medicare spending in Trump's proposed budget\u00a0set up a potential messaging battle ahead of the 2020 election between Democrats pitching an expansion of the popular federal health program\u00a0and Republicans who are taking a Medicare-for-less approach that focuses on cutting back\u00a0spending, our Post colleagues Toluse Olorunnipa and Sean Sullivan report. Democrats, including some who are seeking the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, quickly pounced on the proposed Medicare cuts. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):\u00a0 Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.):\u00a0 \u201cOn one hand, you don\u2019t like handing the other side a potential campaign message at any point, and Democrats will inevitably try to make this into a \u2018Trump wants to cut your Medicare\u2019 argument,\u201d Republican pollster Chris Wilson told our colleagues, adding that the messaging wouldn\u2019t stick in the same way efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare did. \u201cA proposed cut to entitlements in a budget proposal that has no chance of passing the House just isn\u2019t going to enter the public consciousness in the same way.\u201d (iStock\/iStock) OUCH: Hackers may have gained access to the personal information and medical data of more than 600,000 people in Michigan in a cyberattack potentially impacting customers of several\u00a0health-care companies, our Post colleague Hamza Shaban reports. The breach may have included data from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, Health Alliance Plan and McLaren Health Care, said Dana Nessel, the state\u2019s attorney general. The cyberattack targeted Wolverine Solutions Group, a health-care firm that partners with health plans and hospital systems. A public notice from the company doesn\u2019t say how hackers got access to its systems, how long the attack went undetected and how the company learned of the breach. \u201cWSG said it discovered the breach in September, when malicious actors accessed and infected its network with malware,\u201d Hamza writes. \u201cRather than merely stealing customer data, WSG said, the hackers seized control of the company\u2019s records, encrypting them and making them inaccessible in an effort to extort the company. Hospitals and government offices are among the frequent targets of ransomware.\u201d Today The lingering questions about Medicare-for-all: From the Fact Checker: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y) misleading complaint: Trump did not transfer funds for the opioid emergency:","50":"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 Japan has agreed to provide a loan to build Sri Lanka\u2019s first light railway system aimed at easing traffic congestion in the capital city of Colombo, the island nation\u2019s finance ministry said Tuesday. The loan will be granted in six stages until 2024 for the $1.8 billion project that will begin this year, the ministry said. An agreement to release the first instalment of $260 million (30 billion yen) was signed Monday between the Japan International Cooperation Agency, which coordinates official development assistance, and Sri Lanka\u2019s finance ministry. The proposed rail line will have 16 stations and run for 16 kilometers on elevated viaducts to minimize land acquisition. The Japanese agency said the proposed railway system will connect Colombo\u2019s commercial hub with the administrative capital and \u201csignificantly reduce travel time in the most congested transport corridor in the country, and the only major corridor currently not supported by railway.\u201d The agency said the financing is being provided under an economic partnership with interest rates of 0.1 percent and a 40-year repayment period that includes a 12-year grace period. Japan is one of the largest contributors to the transport sector in Sri Lanka and has recently financed a section of the country\u2019s highways and a new bridge to ease traffic congestion in Colombo. The loan came as Sri Lanka struggles to repay $5.9 billion in foreign loans this year, of which 40 percent needs to be serviced during the first three months. The country used its reserves to repay a $1 billion sovereign bond loan in January.\u00a0 A large chunk of Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign debt is from China, with loans obtained to build highways and other infrastructure projects, including some that have become white elephants, aggravating the country\u2019s debt burden. In 2017, Sri Lanka leased out a Chinese-built seaport for 99 years in a bid to recover from the heavy burden of repaying a loan obtained to build the facility.","51":"THE PROGNOSIS Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). (Cheryl Senter\/AP) Sen. Amy Klobuchar is refusing to hop on the Medicare-for-all train. That makes her the only major Democratic presidential contender to stray significantly\u00a0from an ambitious and sweeping plan to overhaul the country\u2019s health insurance system that her primary opponents have embraced. The Minnesota Democrat\u2019s emergence as the race\u2019s centrist candidate has increasingly highlighted the idealism-vs.-pragmatism debate that\u2019s also dividing Democrats inside Congress. Even as progressives push for a Sen. Bernie Sanders-style bill to replace private health coverage with a government-run system, Democratic House leaders\u00a0have tried to keep the focus on\u00a0improving existing health-care programs. That\u2019s the approach preferred by Klobuchar, who said Monday in a CNN town hall that she favors offering more people a Medicaid-type plan \u2013 something Democrats tried to include in the Affordable Care Act but ultimately gave up on over GOP objections that it would give the government an oversized role in the nation's health-care system. \u201cThat is a way to provide a public alternative that\u2019s real \u2026 so that we can bring down the rates,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cAnd then we can look at other options, but we have to start somewhere. And I think we could do that much more immediately.\u201d CNN senior Washington correspondent Jeff Zeleny: Washington Post reporter Paul Kane: All the other senators officially\u00a0seeking the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and, most recently,\u00a0Sanders of Vermont \u2014 have co-sponsored Medicare-for-all as envisioned in a bill introduced by Sanders in 2017. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, also a 2020 contender, has signed on to a similar bill in the House. There haven't yet been any public clashes between the candidates, even though Klobuchar's entrance into the race -- and a potential bid by\u00a0Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) -- has crystallized some health-care fault lines, as New York Times's Alexander\u00a0Burns notes. \"In one camp were a pair of blunt-speaking Midwesterners, Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sherrod Brown of Ohio \u2014 both beloved by many liberals, yet both dismissive of fellow Democrats\u2019 promises to create a vast new apparatus of government-backed health care,\" Alexander writes.\u00a0 \"They endorsed incremental policy changes, like lowering the age of eligibility for Medicare.\" As progressive activists have privately noted to me, the idea of a solely government-run health-care system doesn\u2019t poll well with voters -- that is,\u00a0if what it might entail is explained to them. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is contemplating an independent 2020 bid, has included Medicare-for-all among a list of policies he\u2019s blasted the Democrats for supporting, suggesting they\u2019re creating a pathway for President Trump to win a second term by running too far to the political left. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken about how the far right and the far left are holding our government hostage by engaging in revenge politics and preventing sensible solutions to big challenges, such as health care and immigration,\u201d Schultz wrote\u00a0Monday in a Medium post. Schultz has gone after Harris for advocating that private health insurance be abolished, calling the idea \u201cun-American.\u201d Republicans have adopted a similar tone, accusing Harris and her colleagues of supporting socialist policies. Harris insisted yesterday that Medicare-for-all isn\u2019t about \u201csocialism\u201d but about \u201cproviding health care to all people.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about understanding that access to affordable health care should not be a privilege;\u00a0it should be a right,\u201d Harris told NBC\u2019s Kasie Hunt. \u201cIt\u2019s about understanding that in a democracy, and the way we have constructed our democracy, we at least in concept have said that your access to public education, public health or public safety should not be a function of how much money you have.\u201d But Schultz might be right that voters skeptical of Trump yet not ready to support more liberal candidates are looking for a third way, my Post colleague Eugene Scott writes. It might be Klobuchar \u2014 not the billionaire \u2014 who can fill those shoes. \u201c[Klobuchar\u2019s] stances appear to be rooted in acknowledging a Democratic electorate interested in big ideas but recognizing that some proposals might be too radical to win over independents who backed Trump in 2016,\u201d Eugene writes. The Medicaid idea referenced by Klobuchar is from a bill sponsored by Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who reintroduced his measure just last week. It would allow states to start selling a government-backed Medicaid plan on their individual insurance marketplaces, which people could purchase with the help of Obamacare premium subsidies. Because the plans would be available to higher-income people, they could come with copays and deductibles, but premiums would be capped at 9.5 percent of a family\u2019s income. Klobuchar suggested this incremental approach -- versus a total Medicare-for-all-style overhaul -- would be the fastest and most realistic way of achieving universal coverage \u201cWhat we need is to expand coverage so that people can have a choice for a public option, and that\u2019s a start, all right?\u201d she told a questioner at the town hall. \u201cYou could do it many ways, but you could also do it with Medicaid, something I don\u2019t think we\u2019re talking about enough as a potential solution.\u201d NBC News's Andrea Mitchell:\u00a0 Bloomberg News's Sahil Kapur:\u00a0 Justice Democrats spokesman\u00a0Waleed Shahid: Border Patrol agents detain a 14-year-old from Guatemala who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border alone in January. (Jabin Botsford\/The Washington Post) AHH: The role of the U.S. Customs and\u00a0Border Patrol agency has shifted from national security to humanitarian relief, in part because of the deaths of two Guatemalan children who crossed into the United States in December, our Post colleague Maria Sacchetti reports. After the deaths of Jakelin Caal, 7, and Felipe G\u00f3mez Alonzo, 8, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen vowed \u201cextraordinary protective measures,\u201d and federal officials say medical staff presence has increased at the border. The measures include medical teams from the Coast Guard, the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as private contractors who triage and examine migrant children. The U.S. military is also helping to evaluate and treat migrants. Border agents, including hundreds who are paramedics, monitor remote areas, Maria writes. But the need remains great.\u00a0\u201cA Mexican man detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection died this week at a medical facility, however,\u201d Maria writes. \u201cAnd advocacy groups warn that the remote areas where families are crossing, and the agency\u2019s crowded detention facilities, still pose serious risks \u2014 especially for young children.\u201d Children coming into the United States pose a separate risk. \u201c[T]he American Academy of Pediatrics said it has urged CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan to hire medics trained in pediatrics, or at least accept volunteer pediatricians, because children require more specialized care,\u201d Maria adds. See our rundown of the issue in yesterday's Health 202. A fentanyl user holds a needle near Kensington and Cambria in Philadelphia. (David Maialetti\/The Philadelphia Inquirer via AP, File) OOF: New research reveals the Food and Drug Administration,\u00a0doctors and drugmakers mishandled the dispersal of the powerful opioid fentanyl, which led to thousands of ineligible patients gaining access to the painkiller.  The paper, published in JAMA, found that although pharmacists, drugmakers, prescribers and the FDA agreed to special measures meant to monitor use, the drug was prescribed inappropriately, our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports. The report also found the FDA and drug companies took no action, even after they realized this was happening. Based on five years of insurance claims data, the research found between 34.6 percent and 55.4 percent of patients shouldn\u2019t have received the drugs. Under a \u201crisk evaluation and mitigation strategy\u201d created by the FDA, \u201cdrug companies, doctors, pharmacists and patients themselves received special instruction on the use of the drugs and signed up to be part of the small, closed group allowed to prescribe, dispense and take them,\u201d Lenny writes. \u201cBut the report contends that those safeguards didn\u2019t work.\u201d OUCH: Here\u2019s the latest warning coming down from the FDA: Steer clear of so-called \u201cyoung blood.\u201d  The treatments, \u00a0which involve plasma infusions from young donors, are being marketed as a treatment or cure for conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer's.\u00a0But federal health regulators say there\u2019s no proof the treatments work, our Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports. \u201cThere is no proven clinical benefit of infusion of plasma from young donors to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent these conditions, and there are risks associated with the use of any plasma product,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and Peter Marks, director of the agency\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. \u201cSimply put, we\u2019re concerned that some patients are being preyed upon by unscrupulous actors touting treatments of plasma from young donors as cures and remedies,\u201d they wrote. Clinics offering young-donor plasma infusions have been popping up, promising the \u201cyoung blood\u201d as a rejuvenating \u201canti-aging\u201d therapy, but the FDA statement did not cite any specific companies. Hours after the FDA issued its\u00a0statement, Ambrosia, a company that charged people thousands for these infusions, announced it would stop treating patients, NBC News\u2019s Shamard Charles reports. The company \u201chad been charging $8,000 for one liter of blood and $12,000 for two as part of a clinical trial. The blood was donated by 16- to 25-year-olds to consumers ages 35 and older.\u201d \u2014 Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) seems to be unfazed by reports that Republican lawmakers are looking forward to hearings on her proposed Medicare-for-all bill in order to highlight proposals they're convinced will be unpopular with Americans. To this point, she tweeted yesterday: \u00a0 The Health 202 wrote last week that the Washington Democrat is planning to release a sweeping Medicare-for-all plan around the end of the month and is looking for more support from her party for the plan. \u201cIt\u2019s a 150-page bill \u2026 it\u2019s not an eight-page resolution,\u201d Jayapal told Paige about the measure, insisting she\u2019s confident she\u2019ll have 100 cosponsors by a planned Feb. 26 release. \u201cNow we\u2019re actually putting detail into it, and so we feel confident we will continue to add cosponsors even after introduction.\u201d \u2014\u00a0The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to review a federal court\u2019s decision to strike down a Maryland law aiming to prohibit generic drug manufacturers from \u201cprice gouging\u201d consumers. The law sought to stop drugmakers from hiking generic drug prices in a way the state determined was \u201cunconscionable.\u201d Health-care advocates and Maryland\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Brian Frosh, championed the 2017 law as a \u201cgroundbreaking attempt to rein in skyrocketing prescription costs,\u201d the Baltimore Sun\u2019s Jeff Barker reports. In April, a federal appeals court ruled the law violated the commerce clause of the Constitution, prompting an appeal from Frosh. \u201cThe problem is Maryland cannot protect itself from price gouging, and it leaves vulnerable people throughout our state subject to monstrous price increases by generic drug manufacturers,\u201d Frosh said about the Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to take up his appeal. \u2014 If you have a snow day today or are otherwise looking for something to keep you busy for a half hour, here\u2019s our pitch: Over the weekend, Hasan Minhaj\u2019s Netflix show, \"The Patriot Act,\" tackled the\u00a0convoluted issue of the drug-pricing chain.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) kicks off a 2020 presidential campaign amid a crowded Democratic field: Trump wishes Sanders 'well' in his 2020 run:","52":"The Post reports, \u201cJustice Department officials are preparing for the end of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s nearly two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and believe a confidential report could be issued in coming days, according to people familiar with the discussions.\u201d That report will go to Attorney General William Barr, who refused to promise during his confirmation hearings that he would release the entire report but has little reason to bottle up a report that Congress could subpoena anyway. The Post report continues, \u201cAn adviser to President Trump said there is palpable concern among the president\u2019s inner circle that the report might contain information about Trump and his team that is politically damaging, but not criminal conduct.\u201d That would be the best-case scenario. Let\u2019s start with what will not be in the Mueller report: The findings from the Southern District of New York, which is exploring possible violation of campaign finance laws and Trump\u2019s financial dealings. That could go on for years, and has always been a more serious concern for Trump\u2019s inner circle. The report will also not contain the finding from any Roger Stone trial and\/or plea deal, since that is being handled by the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, not the special counsel\u2019s office. There could be other parts of the investigation Mueller has farmed out to other prosecutors involving Trump, his company, his foundation and his family members. That universe of legal activity will not stop even if Mueller\u2019s part of the investigation does. As for Mueller\u2019s report, no one outside the special counsel\u2019s team really knows what form it will take. Everything from a simple declination to prosecute to a Leon Jaworski\u2019-like road map to impeachment to a Ken Starr-like potboiler is possible. The restriction on release of grand jury testimony could be lifted by Chief Judge Beryl Howell, the very same judge who recently approved unsealing the Jaworski road map. I am less concerned than many that Barr, who is a respected lawyer and owes Trump no particular loyalty, will bury the report, especially if Mueller has obtained approval from the chief judge to release grand jury materials to Congress. Perpetuating rumors and speculation about what is in or not in the special counsel\u2019s report serves no one\u2019s interest. Just as the form of the report is as yet unknown, no outside observer can predict what it will contain. Mueller \u2014 who was charged with overseeing both a criminal and counterintelligence investigation \u2014 has, with each indictment and conviction, provided previously unknown details, introduced new characters and enlightened us as to the extent of the Russian scheme to interfere with our election. While court documents and news reports indicate that many members of the Trump team (Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner) had contacts with Russians or the Russian cutout WikiLeaks during the campaign, what Trump knew about these and what actions, if any, he approved have not yet been revealed. He might have been privy to every move, utterly clueless or somewhere in between. Without knowing what a host of cooperating witnesses, including Cohen, Michael Flynn and Donald McGahn, has told Mueller, it\u2019s foolhardy to speculate as to what Mueller has learned. The only \u201ccollusion\u201d by Trump we can definitively identify occurred in plain sight \u2014 his public request for the Russians to go find Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. WikiLeaks would later oblige, releasing the first emails within hours of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape\u2019s release. (Trump\u2019s efforts to pursue the Moscow Trump Tower deal despite Trump\u2019s public denials provide a possible motive for Trump to cover up his Russian connections, but do not on their face appear to be illegal.) More likely to be included in Mueller\u2019s report is a catalogue of Trump\u2019s efforts to disrupt and interfere with investigations into his and his campaign\u2019s Russia contacts. Trump\u2019s role in concocting phony cover stories (regarding the reason for firing James Comey as FBI director, to explain the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting), his offers to pardon witnesses, his efforts to influence the Manafort jury by publicly disparaging prosecutors, his attempts to get then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to unrecuse himself, his attempt to persuade Comey to go easy on Flynn, and any potentially misleading written answers by Trump to Mueller\u2019s written questions could be laid out so as to bring us to the inescapable conclusion that Trump obstructed justice. Trump and his team are right in one respect: Mueller is highly unlikely to indict a sitting president in violation of Justice Department guidelines. (As a former Justice Department official who has worked with Mueller over the years told me, \u201cHe\u2019s not a guy to color outside the lines.\u201d) The immediate consequences for the president will be political. Once Mueller is done, the host of other investigations will continue while the focus moves to Congress. Congress and the voters get the last say as to when and under what conditions Trump\u2019s presidency will end. Read more: Nelson W.

Gates III speaks during a panel session in the Congress Hall of the 49th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, WEF, in Davos, Switzerland.\u00a0Photo by GIAN EHRENZELLER\/EPA-EFE\/REX (10070269fk) Bill Gates is no stranger to Washington. His foundation has a big office here. And last March he met with President Trump and talked about preventing disease and spreading vaccines. Recently Gates visited some key members of Congress. This time he was talking about what he sees as a key part of the answer for combating climate change: a return to nuclear power. And the Microsoft co-founder was trying to persuade Congress to spend billions of dollars over the next decade for pilot projects that would test two or three new designs for nuclear power reactors. As I wrote in Sunday\u2019s paper, Gates has been thinking about nuclear power for a while. He founded TerraPower in 2006 and during his recent visits to Capitol Hill, he told lawmakers that he personally would invest $1\u00a0billion and raise $1\u00a0billion more in private capital to go along with federal funds for a pilot of his company\u2019s never-before-used technology, according to congressional staffers. \u201cNuclear is ideal for dealing with climate change, because it is the only carbon-free, scalable energy source that\u2019s available 24 hours a day,\u201d Gates said in his year-end public letter. \u201cThe problems with today\u2019s reactors, such as the risk of accidents, can be solved through innovation.\u201d Gates\u2019s latest push comes at an important turn in climate politics. Nuclear power has united both unpopular industry executives and a growing number of people \u2014 including some prominent Democrats \u2014 alarmed about climate change. \u201cI remain convinced that advancing nuclear \u2026 remains in our interest for both climate and national security reasons, and in the end we will not get across the finish line without direct government engagement,\u201d former energy secretary Ernest J. Moniz said in an email. \u201cThis is not special to TerraPower \u2014 it\u2019s a generic challenge.\u201d But many nuclear experts say that Gates is the wrong messenger and that his company is pursuing a flawed technology. They say that any new nuclear design is likely to come at a prohibitive economic cost and take decades to perfect, market and construct in any significant numbers. Lawmakers are listening to him, though. Through the Energy Department, Congress approved $221\u00a0million to help companies develop advanced reactors and smaller modular reactors in fiscal 2019, above the budget request. But Gates and TerraPower, which received a $40\u00a0million Energy Department research grant in 2016, are looking for more. With some Democrats reconsidering opposition to nuclear energy dating back to the Three Mile Island accident 40 years ago, Gates met with lawmakers from both parties, including Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), both senior members of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Last month, he had dinner with Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and three other senators. Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said TerraPower is one of many companies that is raising the public\u2019s hopes for advanced nuclear reactor designs even though they\u2019re still on the drawing boards and will remain unable to combat climate change for many years. \u201cWe think the vendors of advanced nuclear power designs are saying they can commercially deploy them in a few years and all over the world,\u201d Lyman said. \u201cWe think that is counterproductive because it is misleading the public on how fast and effective these could be.\u201d Gates is a believer in tapping innovation on the climate front. He has invested heavily in other nascent technologies \u2014 much of it related to energy storage \u2014 in search of the sort of breakthrough he hopes will slow global warming. And Gates also gave $1 million to the campaign to approve a ballot initiative for a carbon \u201cfee\u201d in the state of Washington. (The effort failed.) But he has warned that a focus on solar and wind would be \u201cdangerous.\u201d Gates, who declined interview requests, won\u2019t say how much he has invested in TerraPower, but the Bellevue, Wash.-based company has about 150 employees. Many nuclear power experts say that the technology Gates is promoting \u2014 called a \u201ctraveling wave reactor\u201d \u2014 does not work as advertised, at least not yet. \u201cThese designs .\u2009.\u2009. require advances in fuel and materials technology to meet performance objectives,\u201d a\u00a0Massachusetts Institute of Technology report\u00a0said last year. In his letter, Gates praised TerraPower\u2019s \u201ctraveling wave\u201d technology. He said it \u201cis safe, prevents proliferation, and produces very little waste\u201d \u2014 important selling points in Congress, which has not settled on the location of a site for long-term waste storage. Gates\u00a0has compared the technology to a candle. He said that uranium-235, which is burned in conventional light-water reactors, would be used to ignite the rest of the candle, burning up depleted uranium-238 that is treated as waste. And instead of water, it would use liquid sodium to cool the plant, which TerraPower said would be more efficient. Gates has said the reactor could be placed in a vessel underground and left there for 60 years without refueling. That would reduce chances for human error and defuse concerns about long-term spent fuel storage or the theft of nuclear material during refueling or fuel reprocessing, the company said. But critics say TerraPower has been stumbling over a handful of obstacles. First, TerraPower has discovered that the traveling wave didn\u2019t travel so well and that it would not evenly burn the depleted uranium in the \u201ccandle.\u201d\u00a0 Second, and partly as a result, it needed to change the design to reshuffle the fuel rods \u2014 and do that robotically while keeping the reactor running. Third, it has struggled to find a metal strong enough to protect the fuel rods from a bombardment of neutrons more intense than those commonly used in reactors \u2014 and for a much longer period of time. TerraPower\u2019s Marcia\u00a0Burkey said in an email that the company has been researching new steel alloys. It has sent ingots to a unique Russian test reactor and brought them back for examination. She said the company had made important advances in that and other areas. In many ways, TerraPower\u2019s design resembles fast-breeder reactors. Fast breeders have faster-moving neutrons, the subatomic particles that trigger fission. Allison Macfarlane, former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said earlier versions of fast-breeder reactors have turned in a \u201cdismal performance.\u201d The United States built two small reactors at a government laboratory in Idaho, Japan built a commercial unit called Monju, and France built two called Phenix and Superphenix \u2014 and all of them have been shut down. TerraPower also suffered a setback in October when the Energy Department effectively killed any chance of building a demonstration reactor in China. The department\u00a0announced measures\u00a0to prevent \u201cChina\u2019s illegal diversion\u201d of U.S. civilian nuclear technology for military purposes. Three years earlier, TerraPower had unveiled an agreement to establish a joint venture with China National Nuclear Corp. to build a pilot reactor. But the Energy Department, in a move that seemed aimed directly at TerraPower, said it would deny new license applications or extensions to existing authorizations related to the Chinese state-owned company. TerraPower has been working on \u201cadvanced\u201d nuclear technology for a decade, and it remains far from filing a final proposal for review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In fact, a small modular reactor design by NuScale Power is the application\u00a0before the NRC. The commission is expected to complete its review by September 2020, NuScale says. Since 2016, TerraPower has also been working with the Energy Department and Southern Co. on another reactor design. That one would rely on molten salt as both coolant and fuel. TerraPower believes an advanced molten salt reactor could be more efficient and produce less waste than current models. However, that technology was examined in different countries 60 years ago \u2014 and abandoned. Lyman said the molten salt was \u201chighly corrosive, so you need special materials for the reactor. That\u2019s an engineering problem they still have to confront.\u201d The political engineering problem still needs work, too, though some surprising bipartisanship has taken place over the past year. An unusual coalition of Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) sponsored legislation aimed at speeding up NRC reactor approvals and capping company costs. The\u00a0Senate passed the bill\u00a0Dec. 20 and the House on Dec. 21. The measure was seen as a triumph for the industry group, the Nuclear Energy Institute, which called it \u201ca significant, positive step toward reform.\u201d The Union of Concerned Scientists took a neutral stance on the measure, which was altered before passage to protect the latitude of the NRC. But Lyman said the group still did not like the \u201cidea of Congress micromanaging NRC licensing activities.\u201d For all nuclear designs, both new and old, the colossal expense of nuclear construction and the absence of a carbon tax remain obstacles. In the United States, only one new nuclear reactor has been completed in three decades. Two were shelved in 2017. Two others in Georgia are running wildly behind schedule and over budget with\u00a0costs running around $27\u00a0billion, more than double the original estimate. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) signs legislation\u00a0before sending it to President Trump for his signature to end the partial government shutdown on Friday. (Reuters\/Joshua Roberts) SHUTDOWN WATCH  \u2014Temporary shutdown relief, but a serious backlog awaits: Federal workers will get a temporary reprieve after Trump agreed to sign legislation to reopen the government through February 15. But the massive bureaucratic reboot necessary to get nine Cabinet agencies and dozens of other federal agencies back up and running means it could take weeks or months for things to return to normal, The Post\u2019s Lisa Rein, Juliet Eilperin and Sarah Kaplan report along with a team of colleagues. \u201cThe National Park Service will need to restore basic amenities at hundreds of parks and monuments, removing accumulated trash and plowing multiple feet of snow,\u201d they write. \u201cThe EPA, for example, must now update its enforcement actions database, which has sat idle for more than a month, along with other key computer registries and air and water permits across the country.\u201d Gary Morton, president of a union representing thousands of Environmental Protection Agency employees asked, \u201c[H]ow much will we be able to accomplish before we have to start worrying about shutdown procedures again if they don\u2019t reach a deal?\u201d Research will take time to get up and running, too: There are almost 2,000 research grants ready to be reviewed that piled up for the National Science Foundation during the impasse. A program director for the foundation told The Post it \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel resolved at all.\" \u201cI\u2019ll be very happy to see my colleagues and make a little progress. But it\u2019s not like we feel relieved. We worry that we\u2019re just going to be used again in three weeks, if nothing is resolved,\u201d the program director said. Even dinosaurs were shut down: Paleontologists\u00a0looking forward to fossil research were on standby during the more-than-month-long shutdown. Fieldwork planning was paused, student recruitment for field research was halted until funding was available, Brian Switek reports for The Post. \u201cPlanning on key conferences has been on hold,\u201d he writes. \u201cEven the process of how new discoveries make their way to publication has come to a halt for anyone needing Interior Department paleontologists to review papers based on findings made on federal lands.\u201d Why the clock tower at Trump\u2019s hotel stayed open: The historic site at the top of the Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington, which houses the Trump International Hotel, stayed open during most of the government shutdown. The General Services Administration, which leases the Old Post Office to the Trump Organization, said in a post on its website that it \u201cwas authorized to pay the National Park Service to keep the observation tower open, even though the Park Service\u2019s funds lapsed during the shutdown,\u201d The Post\u2019s Hamza Shaban reports. \u201cThe GSA said the money came from the Federal Buildings Fund, which is \u201cprimarily supported by rent paid to GSA from other federal entities.\u201d The GSA told The Post the clock tower was one of 8,000 properties across the country funded through the Federal Buildings Fund that were \u201coperating as normal\u201d during the shutdown. \u2014 \u201cThere is a lot I don't understand about climate change\u201d: Bill Wehrum, the EPA\u2019s assistant administrator for the office of air and radiation, said the administration is focusing on climate change but stopped short of calling it a crisis. At a Washington event on Friday, when asked whether the EPA is determining whether global warming is a crisis, he said: \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure that out. I\u2019ll admit I did not come to the agency as a climate change expert,\u201d Reuters reports. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, there is a lot I don\u2019t understand about climate change.\u201d Wehrum also said he\u2019s had a \u201cseries of briefings with climate change experts to help me better understand this \u2026 Everybody is still exploring the science of climate change.\u201d \u2014 The cost of Trump\u2019s rollbacks: The Trump administration\u2019s push to roll back environmental regulations will lead to \u201cmore premature deaths and illnesses from air pollution, a jump in climate-warming emissions and more severe derailments of trains carrying explosive fuels,\u201d the Associated Press reports, based on an analysis of 11\u00a0rules the administration aims to repeal or weaken. \u201cThe AP found the administration has sought to bolster the changes by emphasizing, and sometimes exaggerating, economic gains while minimizing negative impacts,\u201d the report adds.\u00a0 \u2014 Trump admin stalling Puerto Rico aid: Billions in appropriations have not yet been delivered to the U.S. territory about a year after lawmakers approved funds to assist with hurricane recovery, Politico reports. \u201cBeyond dollars and cents, two explanations are offered for the president\u2019s stance,\u201d per the report. \u201cOne is his fixation on Puerto Rico\u2019s substantial debt and the notion that bond holders will profit from disaster aid. The second goes to the rawer stuff of Florida politics\u2014a state important to Trump\u2019s base and the site of closely fought elections this past year.\u201d When asked about Trump\u2019s current position on aid to Puerto Rico, a spokesperson told Politico to refer to an October Trump tweet in which he accused the territory\u2019s leaders of using the \u201cmassive and ridiculously high\u201d disaster funding to pay off debts.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is off to a splashy start in his second run for president, quickly trumpeting a massive fundraising haul in his first 24 hours as a candidate, luring millions to his Tuesday announcement video and brawling with President Trump \u2014 signs of his potential to become a major factor in the Democratic primary. The initial surge and one-day receipts of $6 million reflect a resilience of support for the Democratic runner-up in 2016 and served notice to his competitors, who have so far been unable to create the same groundswell with their campaign launches. It also reinforced the strength of his established political base at a moment when other candidates are only beginning to introduce themselves to voters. That is an asset that could prove valuable, should the contest splinter the party into many different pieces. But Sanders, 77, also is confronting a radically different political landscape than the one he faced four years ago and potential obstacles toward regaining the surprising strength he showed in 2016, when he benefited from being the only serious opponent to the eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. This time, he is facing a crowded and diverse field of challengers who, if not able to match Sanders\u2019s fundraising prowess, have demonstrated some financial strength and have played to overflow crowds in the early voting states. Some of them are doing so with the help of staffers and supporters who backed Sanders in 2016. Sanders, for his part, has yet to prove he can expand his appeal past his limited, if loyal following of younger voters, mostly young men. He had particular issues in 2016 in attracting older women and nonwhite voters, two Democratic blocs whose electoral prominence has only grown in the past two years. Beyond those hurdles, Sanders has faced scrutiny over the way his campaign team handled sexual misconduct claims in 2016 and, perhaps most challenging, is no longer the sole advocate in the race for liberal priorities such Medicare-for-all, a higher federal minimum wage, free community college and other policies embraced by many in the field. Nevertheless, the first day of Sanders\u2019s second campaign swiftly demonstrated that he still commands an audience of both defenders and detractors, surprising some Democrats who have long expected him to run but were unsure how potent a force he would prove to be. \u201cThis is truly remarkable,\u201d President Obama\u2019s reelection campaign finance director, Rufus Gifford, tweeted Wednesday about Sanders\u2019s first-day haul. \u201cI was skeptical of his ability to match his 2016 grassroots $$ magic. I was wrong.\u201d Democratic strategist Jon Reinish, who is not affiliated with any 2020 campaign, said there was \u201cno question\u201d that Sanders \u201chas had an impressive 24 hours.\u201d But, Reinish said, Sanders also \u201centers the race with some significant baggage.\u201d Sanders said Wednesday that his $6 million in donations within a day of his announcement came from 225,000 contributors. By comparison, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a rival candidate seen by some as having had the best previous leap into the race, said she hauled in about $1.5 million in her first 24 hours. Sanders also will be able to transfer some of the more than $9 million in his Senate campaign account at the end of 2018, according to federal campaign finance records. Small-dollar fundraising, the type that benefited Sanders in 2016 and this week, could emerge as a critical factor in the Democratic primary. There is growing skepticism among Democratic voters about wealthy benefactors\u2019 influence on the political process, posing risks for candidates relying on large donations. Sanders ranks as the best example of that; in 2016 he kept his campaign in the running until the end of the primaries, although Clinton had a lock on the party\u2019s major donors. The surest sign of Sanders\u2019s standing in the Democratic field may have come from the president the Democratic candidates are seeking to defeat. President Trump appeared to be trying to elevate the firebrand liberal as part of a broader attempt to cast Democratic candidates as far-left extremists, as he escalates his effort to win a second term. \u201cCrazy Bernie has just entered the race. I wish him well!\u201d Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. On Tuesday, a Trump campaign spokeswoman issued a statement seeking to tether other candidates to him. A couple of hours later, Sanders responded with his own social media missive and a link to a page on his website where people can provide their contact information. \u201cWhat\u2019s crazy is that we have a president who is a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and a fraud. We are going to bring people together and not only defeat Trump but transform the economic and political life of this country,\u201d Sanders tweeted, words that echoed his announcement. Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist, is signaling that he plans to run a campaign reprising many of the signature themes he highlighted in 2016: Medicare-for-all, combating income inequality and aggressively addressing climate change, among other things. \u201cHe will run an issue-focused campaign,\u201d said Sanders adviser Ari Rabin-Havt, who also noted that Sanders\u2019s leadership on major issues will be part of the case he makes to voters. The Vermont senator\u2019s two-minute Tuesday launch video, which had been viewed more than 6 million times on Twitter as of Wednesday afternoon, emphasized that Sanders has been at the forefront of the fight for liberal ideas that have become focal points in the contest. Much of the rest of the field has gravitated to the positions that Sanders has advocated. While some liberal activists see that as a positive development, it could also complicate Sanders\u2019s path to the nomination, leaving voters with a potential choice between the first advocate or one who shares Sanders\u2019s views but may seem more appealing or electable. Over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend in New Hampshire, a key early state whose primary Sanders won in 2016, Sens. Harris and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) both noted their support for Medicare-for-all, though the latter pointed out the difficulty of passing it. Both candidates drew large and enthusiastic crowds. At a church in Portsmouth on a snowy afternoon, Harris drew 1,000 people inside, according to her campaign\u2019s estimate, with 500 or so outside. A house party for Booker in Manchester was packed with interested Democrats eager to hear him speak. But the more intense competition ahead could be between Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), another favorite on the left with a similar message of taking on the wealthy and powerful and being a champion for the working class. \u201cBernie getting in will draw some support in the short term from Warren and also several other candidates,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren. Green also predicted Warren and Sanders would become a \u201cone-two punch that drives the debate among the entire field.\u201d For Sanders, rival candidates are not the only thing he will have to worry about. After his struggle to win over African American voters in 2016, he now faces a field with at least two black candidates, Booker and Harris. In the matter of appealing to women, Sanders publicly apologized last month to women who felt mistreated by his campaign staff members in 2016. Sanders has not clarified, however, when he knew of the allegations and what role he had in adjudicating complaints. In one notable change from 2016, Sanders has a largely new campaign team. He has hired Faiz Shakir, a veteran political operative who had been serving as the national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union, to manage his 2020 campaign. In the past, Shakir worked for former senator Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the speaker of the House. Gilda Cobb-Hunter (D), president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators and a veteran South Carolina lawmaker, said Sanders \u201cseems to have learned the lesson from before \u2014 he is doing outreach in communities of color and recognizing the need to do that.\u201d \u201cIt seems to have dawned on him that he is not the only game in town, and as a result I see that he is more aggressive in his effort here,\u201d she said of her home state. \u201cI do think he had not much choice but to get out of the gate fast. This is a totally different field than when he ran before.\u201d","55":"The chairman of the House \u00adJudiciary Committee said Sunday that he plans to request documents from scores of people and organizations connected to President Trump as part of an inquiry that could eventually lead to his impeachment. The demands from Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), set to be delivered Monday, are the latest indication that Democrats have kicked their scrutiny of Trump into high gear. Speaking on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Nadler said his panel will be sending requests for documents to more than 60 individuals and entities, including the president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr.; Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization; and the Justice Department.

We don\u2019t have the facts yet. But we\u2019re going to initiate proper investigations,\u201d he said.

Despite this, great success!\u201d Meanwhile, several other House committees are digging aggressively into the president\u2019s actions, his 2016 campaign, his businesses and his associates. Nadler\u2019s announcement came just days after the House Oversight and Reform Committee publicly questioned former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen, who implicated Trump in several serious crimes, including potential campaign finance violations connected to hush-money payoffs to women and possible fraud charges concerning falsified documents provided to banks and insurance companies. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the oversight panel\u2019s chairman, said last week that he, too, was interested in securing testimony from Trump\u2019s children and Weisselberg, who has overseen the financial details of Trump\u2019s business ventures for decades. Also last week, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) asked his staff to begin preparing a request for Trump\u2019s past tax returns to be submitted to the Treasury Department in the coming weeks. The request, first reported by NBC News, was confirmed by two Democratic aides familiar with Neal\u2019s action but not authorized to discuss it publicly. The House Intelligence and Financial Services committees also are conducting probes that could touch Trump personally. Nadler\u2019s probe, however, is unique: Only the Judiciary Committee can recommend the president\u2019s impeachment \u2014 a politically explosive move that has been handled carefully by House Democratic leaders even as more and more rank-and-file Democrats say Trump has committed impeachable offenses. A person who was familiar with the pending document requests but was not authorized to comment publicly on the matter said requests dealing with potential obstruction of justice would focus on Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to remove perceived enemies at the Justice Department, including former FBI director James B. Comey, and install more loyal replacements. The requests would also look at potential abuses of power, the person said, including the possible dangling of pardons and witness tampering, as well as Trump\u2019s broader attacks on the entities investigating him and the media. A spokesman for the Judiciary Committee declined to comment. On Sunday, Nadler said he has made no determination about whether to proceed with impeachment. But he said he was personally convinced that Trump has obstructed justice \u2014 an offense that was included in the impeachment articles passed by the Judiciary Committee against President Richard M. Nixon and by the full House against President Bill Clinton. The Judiciary Committee probe, as described by Nadler, would supplement the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III focused on ties between Russia and Trump\u2019s business and campaign. Mueller is widely thought to be in the closing stages of his investigation, with Justice Department officials expecting to receive his report by the end of the month. \u201cThis investigation goes far beyond collusion \u2014 we\u2019ve seen all the democratic norms that we depend on for democratic government attacked by the administration,\u201d Nadler said of his own probe, pointing to Trump\u2019s attacks on the media, intelligence agencies and federal law enforcement. \u201cAll of these are very corrosive to liberty and to the proper functioning of government and to our constitutional system. All this has to be looked at and the facts laid out to the American people.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Friday that she would await Mueller\u2019s findings, as well as a Justice Department investigation based in New York that is probing allegations that Trump paid hush money to two women to conceal affairs, before determining whether the president should be impeached. \u201cImpeachment is a divisive issue in our country, and let us see what the facts are, what the law is, and what the behavior is of the president,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWhen the facts are known, then we\u2019ll make a judgment then.\u201d But Cohen\u2019s testimony has further emboldened rank-and-file Democrats, who are seeing fewer and fewer reasons to shy away from discussing impeachment. Rep. Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.) said Sunday in a CNN interview that Cohen \u201cput some information into public circulation that\u2019s pretty damning to the president.\u201d \u201cIf we find facts that clearly impugn the integrity of the president and potentially reveal crimes, we just don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Kildee said. \u201cThe Constitution is clear: Congress has to do its duty.\u201d Meanwhile, Republicans have amped up the threat of Democratic impeachment proceedings, believing that any attempt to remove Trump from office will motivate the Republican base and turn off swing voters. Responding to Nadler on \u201cThis Week,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said the House Democrats\u2019 investigations represented an effort to leave a cloud over Trump even after Mueller\u2019s findings are released. \u201cThere\u2019s no collusion, so they want to build something else,\u201d McCarthy said, adding that Nad\u00adler \u201cdecided to impeach the president the day the president won the election.\u201d Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said he and his staff received no advance notice of the document requests, learning the news from Nadler\u2019s TV appearance. Collins, too, said it was noteworthy that Democrats are moving beyond the Mueller probe with their own investigations \u2014 suggesting, he said, that they will do anything to find grounds to impeach Trump. \u201cNow that we seem to be getting closer to Mueller\u2019s [report] coming out, they\u2019re backing off \u2018collusion\u2019 and trying to find anything else that will stick,\u201d Collins said in a phone interview. \u201cI think the story here is that Democrats are just trying to find anything to make the president look bad.\u201d Nadler told \u201cThis Week\u201d host George Stephanopoulos that he was mindful of the political necessity of building a public case for impeachment \u2014 one that won\u2019t convince just Democrats. \u201cBefore you impeach somebody, you have to persuade the American public that it ought to happen. You have to persuade enough of the opposition party voters, the Trump voters, that you\u2019re not just trying .\u2009.\u2009. to reverse the results of the last election,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may or may not get there. But what we have to do is protect the rule of law.\u201d","56":"RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Former Brazilian President Michel Temer remained silent when questioned by investigators Friday, a day after he was arrested as part of the country\u2019s sprawling Car Wash corruption probe. The probe has ensnared several top politicians and businessmen in the South American country, including former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is currently serving a 12-year sentence. Temer, 78, was arrested on corruption charges Thursday, with prosecutors saying that construction company Engevix paid him bribes in exchange for a contract to build a nuclear power plant in the city of Angra dos Reis in the southern part of Rio de Janeiro state. Federal prosecutor Fabiana Schneider told journalists that Temer\u2019s attorneys said he would not answer any questions. She said she is \u201cabsolutely convinced\u201d the former president needs to be jailed so investigations can go forward. \u201cThe Car Wash task force has been very restrained in its requests for arrest,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cWe are talking about a criminal organization that has robbed the taxpayer for 40 years.\u201d Lawyers for the former president consider his jailing illegal and have filed two requests for his release. A federal court based in Rio de Janeiro postponed a ruling to next Wednesday. Temer\u2019s former Cabinet minister, Wellington Moreira Franco, was also arrested and has denied any wrongdoing. Both of their arrests come at a time of considerable tension between Car Wash prosecutors and Brazil\u2019s top court. A week ago, the nation\u2019s Supreme Federal Tribunal ruled that some graft investigations should be handled by electoral judges because they involve politicians who allegedly received kickbacks from companies to finance their campaigns. In ruling, some justices acknowledged that Brazil\u2019s electoral court system lacks the infrastructure and expertise to handle such big corruption cases, but expressed confidence that the gap could be bridged. The country\u2019s top court also blocked a move that allowed the Car Wash task force to manage hundreds of millions of dollars recovered from corruption scandals at state-run oil giant Petrobras. While prosecutors and judges involved in the investigation see the imprisonment of Temer as a major win after those setbacks, however, others in Brazil \u2014 including adversaries of the ex-president \u2014 were critical of the decision of federal Judge Marcelo Bretas to arrest him. \u201cCar Wash is trying to turn the focus away from the discredit it was falling into,\u201d said former President Lula da Silva on Twitter Thursday night. \u201cThe (Car Wash) task force does not need pyrotechnics to survive, it needs sobriety.\u201d Luis Henrique Machado, a law professor at IDP university in Brasilia, said the arrest of deeply unpopular Temer on \u201cabsurd grounds\u201d appeared to be a response to recent blows by courts. \u201cProsecutors and magistrates have pressured and intimidated Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court recently. That game is being played,\u201d Machado said. \u201cIt is a judicial invention that could cost all sides dearly.\u201d This is not the first time that Bretas, who is in charge of all Car Wash cases in the state of Rio de Janeiro, has come under fire. Bretas is also behind the arrests of ex-Rio de Janeiro Gov. Sergio Cabral and Brazilian businessman Eike Batista, once number eight on Forbes\u2019 World\u2019s Billionaires list. In 2016, he sentenced then president of state-run Eletronuclear, Othon Luiz Pinheiro da Silva, to 43 years in prison. Supporters of Bretas see him as serious, firm and uncompromising, while adversaries consider him to be a zealot with political ambitions. Temer governed between 2016 and 2018 after his predecessor Dilma Rousseff was impeached. His administration was clouded by corruption allegations, with the former president himself surviving two votes in Congress that would have suspended him from office and put him on trial for graft charges. There are now 10 investigations related to Temer, who was once a discreet backroom dealmaker in Congress before he was propelled into Brazil\u2019s presidency amid a huge political and economic crisis. Temer left office with his job approval in single digits, and many of adversaries were sure that his imprisonment was imminent. ____ AP writer Savarese reported from Madrid.","57":"Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who is weighing a 2020 presidential bid, told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d that President Trump made \u201csome real mistakes\u201d in declaring a national emergency over border security. \u201cI don\u2019t think declaring, using emergency powers was the right thing to do here,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve exaggerated what\u2019s going on at the border \u2014 but we do have issues down there.\u201d Hogan said he agreed with the decision by Maryland\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Brian E. Frosh, to join more than a dozen other states in filing a lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s executive order. Frosh did not need the governor\u2019s approval to file the lawsuit, because the Democratic-controlled General Assembly has given the attorney general blanket authority to sue the federal government. The Hogan interview, which aired Wednesday morning, was the governor\u2019s latest venture onto the national stage after eschewing such attention during his first term in office. Hogan, who is being courted by the \u201cNever Trump\u201d wing of the Republican Party, appeared on CNN earlier this month. In each interview, the governor left the door open on a possible presidential campaign. Hogan said he has been approached about running, adding, \u201cI guess the best way to put is I haven\u2019t thrown them out of my office.\u201d In transcript excerpts distributed by CBS but not included in the broadcast, Hogan said Trump looks \u201cpretty weak\u201d in a general election but doesn\u2019t appear at the moment to be vulnerable to a primary challenge. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that\u2019s going to look like three months, six months from now, depending on how he might soften,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThe issue I\u2019m concerned about is he has a very low reelect number. .\u2009.\u2009. So the chance of him losing in a general election is pretty good. I\u2019m not saying he couldn\u2019t win, but he\u2019s pretty weak in the general election.\u201d In the aired interview, the governor described Trump as \u201chis own worst enemy.\u201d Hogan said that at times the president acts \u201cirrationally\u201d and does things \u201cin a way that aren\u2019t great for the Republican Party and for the country or for him and his agenda.\u201d Asked if he thought Trump was fit to be president, Hogan, who did not vote for Trump in 2016, said he was \u201cnot in any position to judge the fitness of the president.\u201d He said he doesn\u2019t like the tone that Trump uses. \u201cI do believe there are people in Congress and other leaders in the Republican Party who have not stood up when they disagree or when they think the president is doing something wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve not been afraid to do that.\u201d","58":"MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 The most senior Catholic convicted of child sex abuse was sentenced Wednesday to six years in prison for molesting two choirboys in an Australian cathedral in a crime the judge said showed \u201cstaggering arrogance.\u201d Cardinal George Pell must serve a minimum of 3 years and 8 months before he is eligible for parole, according to the judge\u2019s order. The five convictions against Pell carried a maximum possible sentence of 10 years each. \u201cIn my view, your conduct was permeated by staggering arrogance,\u201d Victoria state County Court Chief Judge Peter Kidd said in handing down the sentence. Pope Francis\u2019 former finance minister was convicted by a unanimous jury verdict in December of orally raping a 13-year-old choirboy and indecently dealing with the boy and the boy\u2019s 13-year-old friend in the late 1990s, months after Pell became archbishop of Melbourne. A court order had suppressed media reporting the news until last month. The 77-year-old denies the allegations and will appeal his convictions in the Victoria Court of Appeal on June 5. It was not immediately clear if he will also appeal the sentence. For the first time in Pell\u2019s many court appearances since he returned to Australia from the Vatican to face abuse charges, Pell wore an open-necked shirt without a cleric\u2019s collar. He was also not wearing a cardinal\u2019s gold ring, which might reflect strict rules on jewelry in the state penal system. In explaining his sentencing decision, the judge said Pell had led an \u201cotherwise blameless life.\u201d Kidd said he believed given Pell\u2019s age and lack of any other criminal record, the cardinal posed no risk of re-offending. The judge also took pains to note that he was sentencing Pell for the offenses on which the cardinal had been convicted \u2014 and not for the sins of the Catholic Church. \u201cAs I directed the jury who convicted you in this trial, you are not to be made a scapegoat for any failings or perceived failings of the Catholic Church,\u201d Kidd said. But the judge also said that Pell had abused his position of power and had shown no remorse for his crimes. Kidd described the assaults as egregious, degrading and humiliating to the victims. Pell showed no emotion during the hourlong hearing and barely moved throughout. He stood silently with his hands behind his back as the judge read his sentence. Pell signed documents that registered him for life as a serious sexual offender before he was led from the dock by four prison officers. In a statement, one of Pell\u2019s victims called the judge\u2019s sentence \u201cmeticulous and considered.\u201d \u201cIt is hard for me to allow myself to feel the gravity of this moment, the moment when the sentence is handed down, the moment when justice is done,\u201d the man said in a statement read outside court by one of his lawyers, Vivian Waller. \u201cIt is hard for me, for the time being, to take comfort in this outcome. I appreciate that the court has acknowledged what was inflicted upon me as a child. However, there is no rest for me. Everything is overshadowed by the forthcoming appeal.\u201d The father of one of Pell\u2019s victims who died of a heroin overdose in 2014 at the age of 31 paid tribute to his son\u2019s childhood friend for speaking out. \u201cI commend the young fellow who has come forward,\u201d the father said. \u201cHe kept it in for a long time and that would\u2019ve been hell for him. Absolute hell.\u201d The father said he was \u201creally appreciative and thankful that he did come forward.\u201d \u201cI want to give him a hug. He was a fabulous little kid. He\u2019s a fabulous man now,\u201d the father said. The father also described the sentence as \u201ca disappointment.\u201d The father is considering suing Pell and the church over the abuse. Australian law prohibits the publication of sex crime victims\u2019 identities, so the father also cannot be identified. Abuse victims\u2019 groups also expressed disappointment that the punishment was not harsher. The sentence \u201cmakes a mockery of the concept of true accountability and is not a sentence commensurate with the crimes committed and the harm reaped,\u201d Blue Knot Foundation president Cathy Kezelman said in a statement. SNAP, a U.S. support group for victim of clergy abuse, described the sentences as \u201ccomparatively light.\u201d \u201cWe hope that the sentence imposed on Cardinal George Pell will provide some measure of healing to the living survivor of his abuse and comfort and closure for the family of Pell\u2019s non-surviving victim,\u201d SNAP said in a statement. The judge said Pell\u2019s age was a significant factor in determining his sentence. Pell suffers from hypertension that is exacerbated by stress and has a dual-chamber pacemaker, the judge said. Pell used a cane to leave the court, after having both knees surgically replaced in December. Pell\u2019s sentencing comes on the sixth anniversary of Francis\u2019 election as pope. Pell was in the conclave that elected him and remains eligible for any potential future conclave until age 80 or unless he is removed. Asked by a reporter outside court after the sentencing whether the case against Pell amounted to a witch hunt, his lawyer Robert Richter gave a rueful smile. \u201cNo comment \u2014 you be the judge,\u201d Richter replied. After centuries of impunity, cardinals from Australia to Chile and points in between are facing justice in both the Vatican and government courts for their own sexual misdeeds or for having shielded abusers under their watch. Last week, France\u2019s senior Catholic cleric, Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, was convicted of failing to report a known pedophile priest to police. Barbarin was given a six-month suspended sentence. Pope Francis last month defrocked the onetime leader of the American church after an internal investigation determined Cardinal Theodore McCarrick sexually molested children and adult men. It was the first time a cardinal had been defrocked over the child abuse scandal. The surviving victim made a statement against Pell in 2015 \u2014 a year after the other victim\u2019s death \u2014 to a police task force set up to investigate allegations that arose from a state parliamentary inquiry into handling of child abuse by religious and other nongovernment organizations. The task force also investigates allegations made to a similar national inquiry, called the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Pell gave evidence by video link from Rome to the royal commission, the nations\u2019 highest level of inquiry, in 2016 about his time as a church leader in Melbourne and in his hometown of Ballarat. The four-year royal commission found in its 2017 report that the Melbourne Archdiocese had ignored or covered up allegations of child abuse by seven priests in a bid to protect the church\u2019s reputation and avoid scandal. The royal commission was critical of Pell\u2019s predecessor in Melbourne, Archbishop Frank Little, who died in 2008. It made no findings against Pell, saying in a redacted report that it would not publish information that could \u201cprejudice current or future criminal or civil proceedings.\u201d Australian police interviewed Pell about the survivor\u2019s allegations in a Rome hotel in 2016. Pell described the allegations at the time as \u201cvile and disgusting conduct\u201d that went against everything he believed in. Pell voluntarily returned to Australia in 2017 to face an array of child abuse charges, most of which have since been dropped. The full details of those allegations were suppressed by court orders. Pell was once the highest-ranking Catholic in Australia\u2019s second-largest city, where he is now a prisoner held in protective security. Pedophiles such as Pell are typically separated from the main prison populations in Australia. Pell was 55 years old and had recently established a compensation plan for Melbourne\u2019s victims of clergy abuse when he abused the two boys at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in 1996. The survivor testified that Pell had walked in on the boys swigging altar wine in a back room after a Sunday Mass. The judge rejected Richter\u2019s submission that no person thinking rationally would molest two 13-year-old boys in a cathedral sacristy after a Mass with the doors open. \u201cTo offend in such a risky and brazen manner, I infer that, for whatever reason, you were in fact prepared to take on such risks. I conclude that your decision to offend was a reasoned, albeit perverted one,\u201d Kidd said. More than a month later, Pell abused the survivor again, squeezing the boy\u2019s genitals as they passed in a cathedral corridor after a Mass. The judge said the assault was committed with \u201ca degree of physical aggression and venom.\u201d ___ Associated Press writer Kristen Gelineau in Sydney contributed to this report.","59":"House Democrats are poised to endorse an expansive system to publicly finance congressional campaigns, a forceful statement against the influence of wealthy donors in politics. The plan to funnel billions of dollars in public funds to candidates each election cycle is at the core of a sweeping ethics and elections bill, H.R.\u00a01, that Democrats plan to pass Friday. The legislation also calls for making Election Day a national holiday, requiring presidential candidates to release 10 years of their tax returns, and automatic voter registration. It stands no chance in the Republican-controlled Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) vehemently opposes the legislation and said this week he wouldn\u2019t even allow a vote. But advocates of campaign finance reform say it is a watershed to have near-universal support for public financing among Democrats after 45 years of failed attempts. The embrace of the plan comes as Democrats are coalescing behind other aspirational, liberal proposals, such as Medicare-for-all and a Green New Deal, looking ahead to a day when they have broader power in Washington. They see Friday\u2019s vote creating a new baseline for future initiatives. Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), the lead author of H.R. 1, traveled to states and cities that have implemented public financing systems and said he found bipartisan support. The American public wants \u201cbold moves now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to just kind of nibble around the edges anymore. They want in.\u201d Tiffany Muller, president of End Citizens United, a political action committee focused on campaign finance reform, said House Democrats are responding to a public thirst to counteract the influence of deep-pocketed donors and make Congress more responsive to average Americans. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is massive, overwhelming support from voters for public financing systems,\u201d she said. The public financing provision would give candidates up to $6 for every dollar raised from small donors and also establish a pilot program to give voters $25 campaign vouchers to be donated to any candidate. It has attracted outsize scrutiny from Republicans, who are attacking it as \u201ctaxpayer funding\u201d for campaigns \u2014 more specifically, Democratic campaigns. And some experts question whether public financing is necessary after an election cycle that saw small, grass-roots donors power numerous successful congressional campaigns. Leading the opposition has been McConnell, who called the provision a \u201cbig taxpayer bailout of political campaigns, attack-ad makers and campaign consultants\u201d in a recent floor speech. \u201cThis is how out of touch with taxpayers the modern Democratic Party has become,\u201d he said. \u201cThey saw these proposals to take the American people\u2019s tax dollars and funnel them straight into more attack ads, yard signs and telephone calls, and thought, \u2018What a great idea! Let\u2019s put it in.\u2019\u200a\u201d Democrats have been sensitive to those accusations. An initial draft of H.R.\u00a01 funded the public financing provisions through \u00adtaxpayer appropriations. That prompt\u00aded numerous Democratic lawmakers \u2014 most of them centrists belonging to the moderate Blue Dog Coalition and Problem Solvers Caucus \u2014 to withhold their support for weeks. Party leaders eventually rewrote the bill, assessing a 2.75\u00a0percent surcharge on fines paid by companies and corporate officers who are convicted of or admit to federal wrongdoing. All 235 House Democrats are now co-sponsoring the bill. Taxpayer funding for elections would have been the \u201cpolitical kiss of death,\u201d said Rep. Thomas Suozzi (D-N.Y.), a moderate. \u201cPeople are not ready to have taxes raised for public financing.\u201d Tapping fines paid for corporate malfeasance is \u201ca much more creative way of looking at it,\u201d he added, but that has hardly dampened the GOP attacks. Five states have public financing systems for their legislatures; several more have them for gubernatorial races. There has been federal public financing of presidential elections since 1976, funded by a voluntary checkoff on income tax returns. But that system has atrophied in recent years, with few major candidates willing to abide by its spending limits. The congressional system embedded in H.R.\u00a01 does not contain any spending limits, though the amount of money it would ultimately provide to candidates could be constrained by the amount of revenue generated from fines. The Congressional Budget Office, reviewing an earlier draft of legislation, did not identify a precise cost for the program but said it \u201ccould exceed $1\u00a0billion over the next 10 years.\u201d Beyond the political attacks on the proposal, academic critics say it is unproven whether public financing achieves its proponents\u2019 goal of creating a more equitable and responsive political system. One 2014 paper suggested that public financing reduces the advantages of incumbency but also produces more polarization. John Samples, a Cato Institute vice president who has studied campaign finance reform proposals for more than two decades, pointed to the 2018 midterm elections, where scores of Democratic candidates tapped small-donor networks to fund successful campaigns. ActBlue, the largest Democratic small-donor network, sent a combined $1.6\u00a0billion to candidates in the cycle. \u201cThe idea was, you had coordination problems or whatever, so you needed to bump up the small donors. But now small donor are actually very powerful,\u201d Samples said. \u201cSo what\u2019s the point?\u201d The existing Democratic advantage in small-donor giving, he added, creates a \u201cPR problem\u201d for the party: \u201cWhat the bill is actually saying is, we\u2019re going to take $5\u00a0billion or $6\u00a0billion from the public treasury and give it to the Democratic Party, essentially.\u201d But Fred Wertheimer, executive director of the nonprofit Democracy 21 and a longtime advocate of public financing, said that small donations are being swallowed by unchecked donations to super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited sums. Super PACs reported $1.6\u00a0billion in spending in the 2018 cycle \u2014 supplementing what campaigns spent directly. And he expressed doubt that the small-donor surge would remain sustainable in a political atmosphere without a President Trump to drive voter interest. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to be around as president forever, and the majority of campaigns weren\u2019t financed that way \u2014 incumbents\u2019 campaigns weren\u2019t financed that way,\u201d he said. \u201cThat surge came for challengers, and every candidate should have the opportunity to run for office without having to turn to millionaires and billionaires and lobbyists, fundraisers and bundlers.\u201d","60":"Federal prosecutors in New York on Monday delivered a sweeping request for documents related to donations and spending by President Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, a sign of a deepening criminal investigation into activities related to the nonprofit organization. A wide-ranging subpoena served on the inaugural committee Monday seeks an array of documents, including all information related to inaugural donors, vendors, contractors, bank accounts of the inaugural committee and any information related to foreign contributors to the committee, according to a copy reviewed by The Washington Post. Only U.S. citizens and legal residents can legally donate to a committee established to finance presidential inaugural festivities. \u201cWe have just received a subpoena for documents. While we are still reviewing the subpoena, it is our intention to cooperate with the inquiry,\u201d a spokesman for the committee said in a statement. The subpoena \u2014 issued by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York \u2014 indicates that prosecutors are investigating crimes related to conspiracy to defraud the United States, mail fraud, false statements, wire fraud and money laundering. The subpoena also specifically seeks all communications with one donor, Los Angeles venture capitalist Imaad Zuberi, as well as the firm with which he is affiliated, Avenue Ventures. The company donated $900,000 to the inaugural committee, records show. Steve Rabinowitz, a spokesman for Zuberi, said in a telephone interview that Zuberi knew nothing about the subpoena until contacted by a reporter. \u201cIt is well known that after supporting President Obama and Hillary Clinton that Imaad gave generously and directly to the Trump inaugural,\u201d Rabinowitz said. \u201cBut many others gave substantially more. If in fact he is named in this subpoena, never mind somehow named alone, he is bewildered why.\u201d Asked whether there was any foreign connection to Zuberi\u2019s donation, Rabinowitz said: \u201cThere is no connection of any other individual or entity, and for sure not a foreign one. He gave his own money.\u201d Trump\u2019s inaugural committee raised a record $107 million to fund events and parties surrounding his assumption of office in January 2017, more than twice the amount raised to fund President Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 inaugural. Contributions were made by a wide array of corporate interests and wealthy Trump supporters, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. The committee was chaired by real estate developer Tom Barrack Jr., a longtime friend of Trump\u2019s. Barrack, who is not mentioned by name in the subpoena, declined to comment. The request for documents, first reported by ABC News, is a sign of another widening legal headache for Trump, whose business, personal charitable foundation and campaign are all under investigation by state and federal authorities. The latest subpoena seeks information related to broad topics, including information about benefits provided to top donors, training documents for fundraisers and information related to any payments made directly by donors to vendors. Much of the committee\u2019s fundraising and operation was headed by Rick Gates, a former senior Trump campaign official who served as a deputy chairman of the inaugural committee and is cooperating with prosecutors as part of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation. Gates, a longtime associate of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, pleaded guilty last February to various charges related to his work with Manafort as a political consultant in Ukraine. At Manafort\u2019s trial in Virginia in August, Gates testified that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that he stole money from the inaugural committee by submitting false expense reports for his work. After Trump\u2019s election, Zuberi, a longtime Democratic donor, swiftly emerged as a major contributor to the new president and Republicans. Along with the $900,000 his firm Avenue Ventures gave to the inaugural committee on Dec. 28, 2016, it donated an additional $100,000 to the host committee for the 2016 Republican National Convention on Jan. 13, 2017, campaign finance records show. The donation came months after the Cleveland convention and just days before Trump took office. In the first two years of the Trump administration, Zuberi gave more than $467,000 to the president\u2019s reelection committee and the Republican National Committee, records show. Zuberi\u2019s support for Trump marked a swift reversal for a financier who had previously been a major Democratic giver. In the 2016 election, he gave more than $615,000 to a joint fundraising committee between Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic Party, records show. Four years earlier, he had contributed more than $77,000 to a committee raising funds for Obama\u2019s reelection and the party. Internal Democratic emails released by WikiLeaks in October 2016 show that Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta met with Zuberi in September 2015 to thank him for his support of Clinton. The internal Podesta memo is part of a cache of hacked emails that prosecutors have said were stolen by Russian operatives and provided to WikiLeaks in an effort to help elect Trump. On his Facebook page, Zuberi indicated that he visited Trump Tower in New York in December 2016 as the president-elect prepared to take office, writing that he was with incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn. That was the same day that a delegation from Qatar, including the country\u2019s foreign minister, visited Trump Tower and met with Flynn and campaign chief executive Stephen K. Bannon. Rabinowitz said Zuberi met with the Qataris that day, walked with them to Trump Tower and rode up the elevator with them, but did not participate in their meetings with Trump officials. Zuberi indicated on his Facebook page that he met with the Qatari foreign minister at the Plaza Hotel in New York the following day. Days later, he visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, his Facebook posts show. The inaugural committee has also been scrutinized by the special counsel, whose prosecutors have explored the possibility that foreign money helped fund Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities, according to people familiar with the inquiry. It is not clear whether Mueller is still investigating the committee or referred the case to other prosecutors to pursue. One such case has been prosecuted by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Washington, which in August secured a guilty plea from lobbyist W. Samuel Patten, who admitted to acting as an unregistered foreign agent for a Ukrainian political party. As part of a plea deal, Patten acknowledged that he steered an illegal foreign donation to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, using an American straw donor. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that lobbyist W. Samuel Pattern pleaded guilty to acting as an unregistered federal agent. He pleaded guilty to acting as an unregistered foreign agent.","61":"The Post reports on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-Calif.) remarks during an interview about a potential impeachment of President Trump: \u201cImpeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there\u2019s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don\u2019t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d I\u2019ve always thought that was her position. She avoided making an issue of it during November\u2019s midterm elections, and for very good reason. Impeachment isn\u2019t just divisive; it\u2019s hugely unpopular. In most polling, more than 60 percent of voters disapprove of the idea. There is zero indication so far that Republicans are going to break with him so, even if the House were to impeach him, the Senate wouldn\u2019t reach the two-thirds threshold required (and probably not even a majority) to remove him. Trump would then declare victory and Democrats would look feckless. Unless there is overwhelming and bipartisan consensus that Trump should be removed, it\u2019s not worth seriously considering, she says. Well, that is a very significant qualifier. Impeachment is a monumental undertaking so you better have reason to do so. This is an appropriate analysis since impeachment, undoing an election via Congress, is contemplated as a political, not legal, process and requires a super majority for removal. The American people must be convinced that he cannot remain in office. If there is some atrocious smoking gun and\/or the accumulated evidence is so weighty, then even Republicans\u2019 minds might be changed. The rub is if the evidence is truly compelling but Republicans remain his obstinate defenders. Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe argues that in such a case you also have to consider \u201cthe danger of NOT impeaching a president whose guilt has become clear just because the Senate seems too beholden to the president to remove him.\u201d The alternative would be to refer the case for prosecution (though Trump\u2019s Justice Department won\u2019t move while the president is in office) and\/or consider other sanctions \u2014 such as censure. Tribe contends that \u201cunless and until DOJ does rethink its policy on the criminal prosecution of a sitting president who committed serious crimes to win that office \u2014 the window that Speaker Pelosi has carefully left open for a possible decision by the House to impeach Trump (rather than just trying to defeat him in the 2020 election) needs to be broadened.\u201d Former prosecutor Renato Mariotti had a similar reaction. \u201cWhile I understand why Speaker Pelosi believes that it would not be politically advantageous to impeach Trump if Senate Republicans will not vote to convict, the House has a constitutional duty to uphold the rule of law.\u201d He adds, \u201cGiven the Justice Department\u2019s view that a sitting president cannot be indicted, a decision by the House not to impeach unless conviction in the Senate is certain allows a Senate minority to ensure that a president escapes punishment for serious crimes. While her decision may be politically savvy, the American people deserve to know where each Member of Congress and Senator stands, and for the constitutional process to play out.\u201d Still, Pelosi understands the politics and knows that defeating Trump in 2020 is of the highest priority. If an ultimately ineffective impeachment detracts from that goal, it\u2019s not worth it. It would in fact be a gross political error. Moreover, if a smoking gun does turn up, the possibility of bipartisan consensus remains. But, you say, this means he\u2019ll \u201cget away\u201d with it! Nonsense. As soon as he is out of office, he can be prosecuted like any American at the federal or state level \u2014 and on any number of possible charges including obstruction of justice, campaign finance violations and a host of financial crimes involving his business and\/or foundation. Why bother with congressional hearings? Well, it\u2019s important for the voters to know what Trump has been up to so they can hold him accountable at the polls in 2020. In addition, other people\u2019s crimes or noncriminal wrongdoing may be revealed. The very act of congressional investigation is critical to reestablishing democratic norms and the separation of powers. Moreover, let\u2019s remember that Congress is supposed to investigate lots of things that aren\u2019t crimes \u2014 e.g., a disastrous child-separation policy, conflicts of interest, carelessness in handling security clearances, receipt of foreign emoluments, incompetent foreign policy. That is what we do in a democracy. (I know, it\u2019s difficult to remember after Republicans did nothing.) We insist government be transparent and we hold those responsible to account for their conduct. Finally, remember that both the special counsel and Congress are investigating a counterintelligence matter \u2014 who, if anyone, cooperated\/conspired with the Russians. If Trump, members of his family or current officeholders did it, or were negligent in preventing others from doing it, we need to know. Interestingly, though Pelosi dismisses impeachment, she has no problem pronouncing Trump \u201cunfit.\" I mean, ethically unfit. Intellectually unfit. Curiosity-wise unfit. No, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s fit to be president of the United States. And that\u2019s up to us to make the contrast to show that this president \u2014 while he may be appealing to you on your insecurity and therefore your xenophobia, whether it\u2019s globalization or immigrants \u2014 is fighting clean air for your children to breathe, clean water for them to drink, food safety, every good thing that we should be doing that people can\u2019t do for themselves. You know, I have five kids, and I think I can do everything for them, but I can\u2019t control the air they breathe, the water that they drink. You depend on the public sector to do certain things for the health and well-being of your family, and he is counter to that. Trump\u2019s fitness for office is a matter for the voters. They made a horrible judgment in that regard in 2016. Next year, they\u2019ll have to consider the past four years and render a different judgment.

The Michigan State University study, titled \u201cMichigan School Finance at the Crossroads: A Quarter Century of State Control,\u201d offers a comprehensive look at school funding in the state since the 1994 passage of a law known as Proposal A, which largely shifted funding from local school districts to the state. According to the report, total K-12 education funding declined by 30 percent between 2002 and 2015, with 74 percent of that drop caused by declining state support for schools. The authors, Professor David Arsen and doctoral students Tanner Delpier and Jesse Nagel, wrote: Michigan ranks dead last among states in total education revenue growth since the passage of Proposal A. After adjusting for inflation, Michigan\u2019s education revenue in 2015 was only 82 percent of the state\u2019s 1995 revenue. No other state is close to a decline of this magnitude. In 48 states, 2015 education revenue was higher, often much higher, than in 1995. Michigan\u2019s real per-pupil revenues declined by 15 percent over this same period, ranking 48th among the 50 states. This has occurred, it says, not because the state\u2019s economy is doing poorly but because policymakers have chosen to \u201ccut taxes, create tax breaks, and rely on revenue sources that do not grow with the economy.\u201d The report says: Michigan\u2019s extraordinary slide in K-12 education funding is all the more striking because it occurred simultaneously with the state\u2019s establishment of ambitious curricular and achievement standards for children. The standards-based accountability movement has brought historic and fundamental changes to U.S. public schools. But while most other states have accompanied increased outcome expectations with increased resources to meet them, Michigan policymakers have reduced resources. DeVos was born and raised in Michigan. She and her husband, Dick, spent years leveraging her family\u2019s fortune and political activism to successfully remake Michigan into a state that embraces \u201cschool choice\u201d with as little oversight as possible. It is an agenda she continues to promote as U.S. education secretary. The report says 10 percent of Michigan students are enrolled in charter schools and 14.3 percent participate in a program that allows them to choose schools in districts in which they do not live. But those elements of the state\u2019s choice funding \u201cpromote inefficiency.\u201d For example: By establishing an independent system of schools alongside the traditional system, charter schools may increase per-pupil overhead costs due to the duplication of administrative and instructional support services, or failure to coordinate operations (for example, transportation) across the two sectors. Schools that receive public funds should be accountable to the public. Michigan\u2019s charter schools submit the same financial reports to the state as local districts. However, when a charter school is managed by a private company, some financial information may not be readily available. Changes in financial reporting guidelines could improve the transparency of charter schools\u2019 management fees, rental payments, and employee compensation. The report also says despite Michigan\u2019s declining enrollment overall in public schools, the number of at-risk students increased significantly, from 490,050 in 1995 to 676,483 in 2017. In fact, nearly half of Michigan students are now classified as at-risk, and that share is much higher in many district and charter schools. Yet even with that increase in at risk-students, state at-risk funding has dropped 60 percent since 1995, according to the report. Meanwhile, \u201cMichigan\u2019s current funding system provides built-in advantages for wealthy school districts,\" the report said. Spending on special education has been \u201cunusually stingy,\" it says, and this has hurt special education and general education students. Today, Michigan\u2019s state government covers less than one-third of the costs for federally required special education. That means school districts have to help cover the cost of federally mandated special education, and they take, on average, $500 per student from general education funds each year to pay for those services. The authors make recommendations to improve the educational landscape in Michigan, including: The report says: If Michigan devoted the same fraction of its economy to state and local taxes today as in 1972, it would generate an additional $15 billion in tax revenues per year. That represents 76 percent of total K-12 education revenues from federal, state, and local sources in 2015. If Michigan\u2019s tax effort only increased to the 2015 national average, it would generate an additional $3 billion in revenues per year, an increase of more than 15 percent above 2015 total revenue. To put this in perspective, if Michigan\u2019s tax effort increased to the national average, the additional $3 billion in revenue would be sufficient to nearly restore real school funding to the level that prevailed in 1994.

The filing made PG&E a massive victim of climate change, unable to deal with years of drought that made dry forests kindling for damaged transmission lines. While other factors also pushed the company into bankruptcy, the utility\u2019s fate served as a wake up call to other companies potentially vulnerable to climate change. The biggest utility company in the country, PG&E was recently cleared of blame in the destructive Tubbs Fire, which blazed through Santa Rosa in fall 2017. But the company is still under scrutiny for its role in the Camp Fire, the worst wildfire in state history, which razed the small town of Paradise in November and killed 86 people. Mired in lawsuits, PG&E now has more than $50 billion in liabilities, according to bankruptcy court filings. It listed its assets at a little more than $71 billion. \u201cThroughout this process, we are fully committed to enhancing our wildfire safety efforts, as well as helping restoration and rebuilding efforts across the communities impacted by the devastating Northern California wildfires,\u201d John Simon, PG&E\u2019s interim chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cThrough this process, we will prioritize what matters most to our customers and the communities we serve \u2014 safety and reliability. We believe that this process will make sure that we have sufficient liquidity to serve our customers and support our operations and obligations.\" PG&E\u2019s bankruptcy announcement has garnered criticism from investors, government officials and the public, who fear that the company\u2019s actions will send utility rates skyrocketing and leave wildfire victims without an avenue for recompense. The bankruptcy filing immediately puts a halt to the wildfire lawsuits and consolidates them in bankruptcy court, where legal experts say victims are likely to receive less money. Wildfire victims have little chance of getting punitive damages or taking their claims to a jury in a bankruptcy proceeding. Instead, they will have to tussle with PG&E\u2019s creditors, including bondholders, for a payout from the company. \u201cThe PG&E bankruptcy, while expected, has far-ranging implications beyond just California ratepayers,\u201d said John Kilduff of Again Capital. \u201cCalifornia had led the way, opening up its electricity and natural gas market, and PG&E was a dominant force. The result were lower prices for consumers, and that model is now threatened. Insurance companies and those who did not have insurance on their homes will left holding the bag, as PG&E will escape a great deal of financial liability. \u201c The San Francisco-based company, which provides power to about 16 million people in northern and central California, is also asking the court to approve $5.5 billion in debtor-in-possession financing to fuel its operations while it undergoes bankruptcy proceedings. When it announced its intent to file bankruptcy, the company fenced off the entrance to its headquarters, bracing for public protests. On the morning of Nov. 8, PG&E employees saw smoke near a utility tower that had abruptly lost power. Within 15 minutes, the first flames of the Camp Fire began roaring through the Sierra foothills. The company reported the overlap between the tower outage and the start of the fire to state regulators, who have yet to decide whether PG&E is to blame for the blaze. Only California and Alabama hold utilities \u201cstrictly liable\u201d for fires started by their equipment. The liability applies even if the company\u2019s equipment was working correctly and met safety requirements at the time of an incident, a high standard that last summer PG&E officials lobbied the state legislature to lower. Company executives said at the time that \u201cyesterday\u2019s laws will not keep up with tomorrow\u2019s risks.\u201d But many analysts also blamed PG&E for a lax corporate culture. \u201cCalifornia needs radical changes from its largest utility. Frequent disasters (including wildfires and the deadly San Bruno pipeline explosion in 2010) continue to plague PG&E, and leadership changes have been slow to overhaul the company\u2019s culture of safety,\u201d Height Analytics, an investment advisory service, said in a note Tuesday morning. In the past month, the chief executive, three other senior executives and a member of the board of directors have resigned. Utilities rarely go bankrupt, though a major subsidiary of PG&E filed for bankruptcy in 2001. The company then blamed government officials and regulators for California\u2019s energy crisis, part of the fallout from the scandal involving Enron. BlueMountain Capital Management, a key PG&E investor that was outspoken against the company\u2019s earlier steps toward bankruptcy protection, called for the removal of PG&E\u2019s current board of directors Tuesday in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s filing is the latest example of how the Board continues to fail the Company, wildfire victims, customers, employees, creditors, shareholders and the people of California,\u201d the asset management firm said. \u201cWe urge all stakeholders to support change at PG&E and will be proposing a \u201cNew Slate\u201d of highly-qualified and impartial directors.\u201d The bankrupt utility also faces claims from suppliers of renewable energy. Those payments cost PG&E $2.2 billion a year. Many of those contracts were made at above market prices to help the utility fulfill aggressive renewable energy requirements set by the state, and it is possible that PG&E will seek to renegotiate those contracts at lower prices. One of the biggest firms selling renewable energy to PG&E, NextEra, has appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which indicated that it might try to assert jurisdiction. The company said it intends to pay suppliers in full for goods and services provided after the bankruptcy date. It has asked the court to authorize payment of employee wages, health-care and other benefits. It also asked for authorization to continue customer programs, including low-income support, energy efficiency and other programs encouraging clean energy measures, according to a news release. PG&E\u2019s stock jumped more than 17 percent in morning trading following the announcement. Thomas Heath and Scott Wilson contributed to this report.","64":"The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.9 percent pace last year, the Commerce Department reported Thursday, a strong rate but just shy of President Trump\u2019s goal of 3 percent. Last year\u2019s growth marked the fastest gain for the economy since 2015, according to official government data. The economy received a big boost from the largest corporate tax cut in U.S. history that went into effect last year, as well as additional government spending on military and domestic programs. But that stimulus is widely expected to wear off later this year, causing growth to slow. Growth in the final quarter of last year was 2.6 percent, above forecasts but below the 3.4 percent pace in the third quarter and 4.2 percent pace in the second quarter. Consumer and business spending were both strong, but Americans bought a little less than they did earlier in the year. \u201cLast year was likely the best year of this business cycle,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. \u201cWe stimulated the heck out of the economy last year and that stimulus will fade this year.\u201d Trump and his top officials have repeatedly said they can achieve at least 3 percent annual growth for the next decade with the president even claiming it \u201ccould go to 4, 5, and maybe even 6 percent\" as Republicans put the final touches on the tax cut bill in late 2017. The White House says it achieved its goal because the growth rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 is 3.1 percent above the fourth quarter of the prior year. The Commerce Department calculation compares the average growth for 2018 to the average growth in 2017.  \u201cOur policies are working,\u201d said Kevin Hassett, head of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors. \u201cWe said there would be a capital spending boom and we would get 3.1 percent growth. That is what happened.\" There\u2019s heavy debate among economists about which measure is preferable. Using the White House\u2019s preferred method means last year was the strongest for economic growth since before the recession. Hassett said the White House remains \u201cconfident\u201d that \u201c2019 will be another 3 percent year.\u201d  The vast majority of economists predict growth will be lower this year. The Federal Reserve is currently predicting 2.3 percent growth for 2019. Fed vice chair Richard Clarida said Thursday morning that he is likely to lower his forecast as headwinds overseas in Europe and China could drag down growth at home. \u201cWhile my baseline outlook for growth, employment, and inflation is a positive one, a number of crosscurrents that are buffeting the economy bear careful scrutiny,\u201d Clarida said, noting that some recent economic data has been disappointing.  The Commerce Department had to delay this report because of the partial government shutdown that furloughed many employees who work on key economic data collection and calculation.  Consumer spending continues to power the economy with Americans opening their wallets on a wide range of purchases. Business investment also picked up in the final quarter last year, a sign that companies are still hiring and investing because they do not foresee a recession on the horizon. There were especially strong gains in intellectual property and equipment purchases, but spending on residential homes declined 3.5 percent. The home building industry has continued to struggle with rising interest rates dissuading buyers and higher costs for some materials because of Trump\u2019s tariffs. \u201cThe consumer is trending lower, though consumption is still strong. My main concern is housing investment which fell for the fourth consecutive quarter,\" said Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG. \"If this continues into 2019, it will be a worrying signal for future growth. \" \u200bTrade was a drag on growth at the end of last year as imports heavily exceeded exports, meaning Americans brought more foreign products than they sold. There was a rush earlier in the year to sell U.S. soybeans and other products to China before Trump\u2019s tariffs went into effect, but that trend has now reversed. Trump and many top aides have sounded optimistic that there will soon be an agreement with China to end the trade dispute. Stocks have rallied and are back near an all-time high reached in late September as trade news has improved and the Fed announced a pause in interest rate increases.  Hassett predicted economists will likely need to revise their forecasts higher for this year once trade negotiations with China wrap up. But many economists remain more cautious, although they don\u2019t see an imminent recession. Much will depend on whether American consumers continue to spend and whether businesses keep investing in new technology and factories.  \u201cAs we look ahead to 2019, there are good reasons to expect growth not to be as strong, but I don\u2019t anticipate growth collapsing,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.

The FEC ordered the super PAC and the company to pay a combined $940,000 in penalties \u2014 one of its largest fines to date, according to FEC records. The violation centered on communications between a Chinese couple, Gordon Tang and Huaidan Chen, and Bush\u2019s brother Neil Bush, who was raising money for the super PAC and was involved in business with the couple. In 2015, the super PAC, Right to Rise, accepted $1.3 million from the U.S. arm of an international private investment firm, American Pacific International Capital (APIC). Tang and Chen own a majority interest in the corporation that owns the investment firm, according to the legally binding conciliation agreement made public Monday. Under federal law, foreign companies are barred from making contributions toward U.S. elections. Their U.S.-based subsidiaries are permitted to donate \u2014 but only under strict conditions and if the contributions are not coordinated or directed by a foreign national. The FEC concluded, however, that Neil Bush discussed the donation with Tang and was aware that Tang and Chen were involved in the contribution, according to the agreement. In the agreement, APIC contended that it acted in good faith, believing that the donation was permissible because the person who made the decision to give it was its U.S.-citizen executive director. Right to Rise also said it acted in good faith and thought the contribution was legal. The FEC did not find that there was knowing or willful violation, which would have led to a criminal investigation. The two men \u201cdiscussed the possibility of APIC making a contribution\u201d to Right to Rise, the agreement says. After their conversation, Bush wrote an email to the executive director of APIC that Tang \u201cexpressed interest in donating legally through APIC to my brother Jeb\u2019s political action committee.\u201d Bush consulted Republican campaign finance lawyer Charlie Spies, who was the treasurer and general counsel for Right to Rise. In a memo, Spies outlined the legal requirements regarding such contributions, and Bush provided the memo to Chen and APIC\u2019s executive director. She replied, the agreement shows, addressing the executive director: \u201cGordon wants you to follow up on this matter. Pls check with [APIC\u2019s in-house counsel] and contact him by phone.\u201d FEC Chair Ellen Weintraub tweeted Monday about the agreement: \u201cForeign interference in our elections is a direct attack on our democracy. I am deadly serious when it comes to tracking down & punishing foreign spending in our elections. The @FEC *will* hold committees to account. And a letter from your lawyer will *not* get you off the hook.\u201d APIC agreed to $550,000 in civil penalties paid to the FEC and Right to Rise agreed to $390,000. \u201cRight to Rise conciliated this matter to avoid the cost of litigation and appreciates the commission\u2019s recognition of its extensive compliance efforts,\u201d Spies said. Mark Irion, spokesman for APIC, said APIC signed the agreement to \u201cput this behind them. .\u2009.\u2009. They will not be appealing this.\u201d \u201cMr. Bush believed that he was acting consistently with the legal advice that he sought, because 100\u00a0percent of the contributions were American,\u201d Irion said. The agreement came in response to a 2016 complaint from the Campaign Legal Center, which advocates for greater regulation of campaign finance. The donation was reported by the Intercept. The conciliation agreement was first reported by Mother Jones, before it was released publicly by the Campaign Legal Center.","66":"\u201cMichael Cohen plead [sic] guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime. President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!\u201d  \u2014 President Trump, in a tweet, Aug. 22, 2018 \u201cMichael Cohen pled guilty to something that isn\u2019t even a crime.\u201d  \u2014 Trump, in a Fox News interview, Dec. 13, 2018 \u201cMany campaign finance lawyers have strongly stated that I did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws, if they even apply, because this was not campaign finance. Cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me, but he plead [sic] to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not guilty even on a civil basis. Those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence.\u201d  \u2014 Trump, in a series of tweets, Dec. 13, 2018 Trump says it wasn\u2019t a crime when his fixer arranged hush-money payments for two women during the 2016 presidential campaign. But prosecutors charged crimes, Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to crimes, and a judge sentenced him to three years in prison. So what in the world is Trump saying? Cohen also pleaded guilty to tax evasion and making false statements to Congress and financial institutions. The hush-money charges involve Trump directly, though, and the president says they\u2019re way overblown and were tacked on to embarrass him. Trump says he never ordered Cohen, his former personal attorney, to commit crimes. We\u2019re fact-checking Trump\u2019s separate claim that the hush-money payments weren\u2019t even crimes to begin with. Trump also suggests he\u2019s being unfairly singled out, noting that President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign only paid a fine for misreporting contributions in 2008 and that members of Congress for years had a special fund to settle employment claims, including sexual harassment cases. All of this spin is worth unpacking. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York said the hush-money payments were illegal campaign contributions that ended up depriving voters of information about Stormy Daniels, Karen McDougal and their alleged affairs with Trump. Cohen paid $130,000 to Daniels in October 2016 and got American Media, publisher of the National Enquirer, to purchase the rights to McDougal\u2019s story in August 2016. AMI paid McDougal $150,000 and promised to give her regular media exposure, but her story was never published. The acting U.S. attorney on the case, Robert Khuzami, said Cohen hid this information because he knew it would have influenced the 2016 election. The maximum an individual may contribute to a candidate is $2,700 under federal law. The hush-money payments Cohen arranged were effectively campaign contributions because they influenced the election in Trump\u2019s favor, but they went over the $2,700 limit, prosecutors said. \u201cWhile many Americans who desired a particular outcome to the election knocked on doors, toiled at phone banks, or found any number of other legal ways to make their voices heard, Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows,\u201d federal prosecutors wrote in a December brief for Cohen\u2019s sentencing. \u201cHe did so by orchestrating secret and illegal payments to silence two women who otherwise would have made public their alleged extramarital affairs with Individual-1 [Trump]. In the process, Cohen deceived the voting public by hiding alleged facts that he believed would have had a substantial effect on the election. \u2026 To promote transparency and prevent wealthy individuals like Cohen from circumventing these limits, Congress prohibited individuals from making expenditures on behalf of and coordinated with candidates.\u201d Cohen arranged the payments to Daniels and McDougal \u201cin coordination with and at the direction of\u201d Trump, prosecutors said in the sentencing brief. However, they did not charge Trump, and under Justice Department policy, it\u2019s not possible to indict a sitting president. Some conservatives argue that it was a big stretch for federal prosecutors in Manhattan to turn the hush-money payments into criminal charges for Cohen. Here\u2019s Bradley A. Smith, a former Republican chairman of the Federal Election Commission, writing in the National Review: The U.S. Attorney is placing all his chips on the language \u201cfor the purpose of influencing an election.\u201d Intuitively, however, we all know that such language cannot be read literally \u2014 if it were, virtually every political candidate of the past 45 years has been in near-constant violation. The candidate who thinks \u201cI need to brush my teeth, shower, and put on a nice suit today in order to campaign effectively\u201d is surely not required to report as campaign expenditures his purchases of toothpaste, soap, and clothing. When he eats his Wheaties \u2014 breakfast of champions, and surely one cannot campaign on an empty stomach \u2014 his cereal and milk are not campaign expenses. When he drives to his office to start making phone calls to supporters, his gas is not a campaign expense. Another Republican former FEC commissioner, Hans von Spakovsky, wrote that these hush-money payments shouldn\u2019t count as campaign funding. Regardless of his presidential bid, Trump was such a celebrity that he would have had to pay off alleged mistresses anyway, he wrote, and the law doesn\u2019t restrict expenses that arise \u201cirrespective\u201d of a candidate\u2019s campaign. \u201cIf Khuzami\u2019s legal theory is correct \u2014 that any payments made to settle such a claim are campaign-related expenditures because they are intended to protect the reputation of a candidate and thus influence the election \u2014 a lot of members of Congress are in potential trouble,\u201d von Spakovsky wrote. Trump seems to agree with these writers, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Cohen was sentenced to prison for crimes including the hush-money payments. Cohen admitted in court that he wanted to influence the election by suppressing the women\u2019s stories and that he broke the law to help Trump win. Whether Trump faces a legal risk from the payments is another matter. As we\u2019ve reported, the Justice Department says a sitting president can\u2019t be indicted. Less clear is whether Trump could face charges after leaving office. Cohen could be guilty at the same time that Trump is not guilty, \u201cdepending on intent,\u201d said Solomon L. Wisenberg, a former federal prosecutor who led the grand jury questioning of President Bill Clinton in 1998. John Edwards, the former Democratic senator and presidential candidate from North Carolina, went on trial over more than $1 million in hush-money payments to his mistress, Rielle Hunter. The jury acquitted him on one count and deadlocked on five others, and the case ended in a mistrial in 2012. Justice Department prosecutors argued that the payments to Hunter from two Edwards donors were illegal campaign contributions meant to keep the affair hidden from voters in 2008. Edwards\u2019s attorneys said the payments actually were meant to hide the affair from the senator\u2019s wife. The New York Times reported that the Edwards case \u201cshows the risk of charging a politician with campaign-finance crimes over hush-money payments to mistresses, in which it is unclear whether the transactions were about trying to win an election or trying to protect the candidate\u2019s personal life.\u201d But there are some big differences setting apart the Edwards and Trump cases. Unlike Trump, Edwards admitted to the affair. His biggest donor, Bunny Mellon, didn\u2019t know her money was going to Edwards\u2019s mistress, according to a friend of Mellon who testified at trial. Cohen not only knew where the money was going, but he also admitted to the whole detailed scheme in court. Edwards never had to deal with this kind of nightmare scenario \u2014 seeing his lawyer flip and admit crimes to influence an election. \u201cJohn Edwards did have co-conspirators rolling on him. But the prosecution could not show that either Edwards, or anybody on his staff, solicited campaign contributions specifically for the purposes of paying off his mistress, Rielle Hunter,\u201d according to an analysis on the differences between the Edwards and Trump cases on Above the Law, a website that deals with legal issues. It\u2019s not surprising to see Trump trying to minimize Cohen\u2019s actions. The president also claims that Obama\u2019s campaign-finance violations from 2008 were in the same league as the hush-money payments. \u201cYou know, President Obama had a really big one from 10 times more money, much more money. And you know what? He paid a fine. I\u2019m the only one that this happens to,\u201d Trump said in the Dec. 13 interview on Fox News. But, as our Post colleague Michelle Ye Hee Lee wrote: In April 2012, the FEC released an audit of the [Obama] campaign that found that the committee did not disclose the identities of the 1,312 donors responsible for nearly $2 million in contributions in the final weeks of the campaign. Those donations made up one-quarter of 1 percent of the $778 million raised for his White House bid. The infractions found in the audit were relatively minor considering the volume of contributions, campaign finance experts said at the time. \u201cOverall, this is a very clean audit report for the Obama campaign. The FEC spent two years picking over $750 million in contributions and expenses and found one violation,\u201d former Republican FEC chairman Michael Toner told Reuters at the time. In the Fox News interview, Trump added: \u201cWhat about Congress? Where they had a slush fund and millions and millions of dollars is paid out each year. \u2026 Have they listed that on their campaign finance sheets? No.\u201d He was referring to the members of Congress who paid settlements for workplace violations, including sexual harassment cases, using a special account funded by taxpayers. \u201cCongressional employees have received small settlements, compared with the amounts some public figures pay out,\u201d The Washington Post reported in 2017. \u201cBetween 1997 and 2014, the U.S. Treasury has paid $15.2 million in 235 awards and settlements for Capitol Hill workplace violations, according to the congressional Office of Compliance. The statistics do not break down the exact nature of the violations.\u201d The settlements came under heavy criticism. But this process in Congress was the law. Cohen\u2019s hush-money payments were found to be against the law. Anyway, a week after Trump made these comments on Fox News, he signed an overhaul to this very law. It requires members of Congress to \u201creimburse the Treasury Department for settlements and awards resulting from harassment or retaliation they commit.\u201d We sought comment from the White House but did not receive a response before publication. Cohen says he committed a crime, prosecutors say he committed a crime, a judge found that he committed a crime, and usually those are all the ingredients you need for a crime. Trump says he never ordered Cohen to break the law and silence Daniels and McDougal. But when he says such payoffs are not criminal to begin with, his defense goes off the rails. Trump is presenting a legal theory as fact to minimize his fixer\u2019s crimes. It\u2019s a bizarre claim to make with Cohen heading to prison, and it merits Four Pinocchios.

(Evan Vucci\/AP) With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0Over the vocal objections of the Trump administration, the Senate voted 54 to 46 yesterday to cut off U.S. support for the vicious, Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. The invocation of the War Powers Act will soon be taken up in the House, where it has more than enough support to pass. Later today, the Senate is poised to pass the resolution of disapproval that rebukes President Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration at the U.S.-Mexico border. It has already advanced through the House. Seven Senate Republicans broke ranks on Yemen, and the White House now expects between 10 to 12 GOP senators will defect on today\u2019s wall vote, a senior administration official told my colleague Josh Dawsey last night. Coming from a Senate that\u2019s proved\u00a0so pliant to Trump\u2019s whims over the past two years, the back-to-back votes are significant and could foreshadow more resistance \u2014 or independence \u2014 to come. Trump has promised he will veto both bills. These would be his first vetoes since taking office. Though neither the House nor the Senate has the two-thirds necessary to override him on either one, the resolution of disapproval will provide fodder for lawyers challenging the constitutionality of the emergency declaration in courts. The one-two punch gets at the very heart of the separation of powers. Declaring war and spending money are bedrock powers assigned to Congress in the Constitution, but the legislative branch has abdicated both over time to what Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. called \u201cthe imperial presidency.\u201d Trump knows he\u2019s going to lose on the floor today, aides say, but he\u2019s trying to wrangle enough votes so that he\u2019s not embarrassed by a lopsided final count. To lock down the support of Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), for example, the administration promised that money for the wall won\u2019t be diverted from Arizona military construction projects. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) confer on Wednesday after the Senate voted to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led coalition fighting in Yemen. (J. Scott Applewhite\/AP) -- Senate Republicans tried to give Trump an off-ramp to defuse what could be described as a constitutional crisis, but the president wouldn\u2019t take it. The president rejected a compromise plan put forward by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), which would have allowed him to score a victory on the disapproval vote, because he did not want to foreclose the possibility of using emergency powers again in the future to advance policy objectives that Congress does not support. Indeed, if he gets away with this \u201cemergency,\u201d it seems like a pretty safe bet he\u2019ll be emboldened to try it again \u2014 as will future Democratic presidents. We\u2019re standing on a slippery slope. \u201cTrump called Lee to express his opposition as Lee lunched with fellow Republican senators at the Capitol. \u2026 Lee then relayed the information to his colleagues,\u201d Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and John Wagner report. \u201cMany Senate Republicans had started to align behind Lee\u2019s measure, which would amend the National Emergencies Act to say an emergency declaration would automatically expire after 30 days unless both chambers of Congress vote to keep it. The goal is to give Congress the authority to approve a national emergency declaration \u2014 not to disapprove it, as is currently the case in law. If it had become law, Lee\u2019s bill could have affected Trump\u2019s national border emergency in the future, since ongoing national emergency declarations must be reaffirmed annually. And it would have affected future national emergencies declared by Trump, as well as by other presidents.\u201d Lee also sponsored the Yemen resolution with Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). His father, Rex Lee, was Ronald Reagan\u2019s solicitor general, and he clerked for Sam Alito when the future justice sat on the Third Circuit. The 47-year-old defeated an incumbent GOP senator in 2010 by promising Utahans that he\u2019d stand up to presidents in both parties. \u201cCongress is supposed to be the first among the federal government\u2019s three co-equal branches,\u201d Lee said in a statement. \u201cFor decades, Congress has been giving far too much legislative power to the executive branch.\u201d -- On the national emergency vote, we\u2019ve got a running whip count on our website. Kate Rabinowitz has compiled what every Republican senator has said about Trump\u2019s declaration. -- Twenty defections would be needed to override the veto, as Republicans have a 53-to-47 majority and Vice President Pence can cast a tiebreaking vote. No one thinks that will happen. -- The failure to make a deal with conservatives who wanted to find a way out is another indication of Pence\u2019s limited juice. He can\u2019t effectively speak for Trump when he\u2019s on the Hill, and he\u2019s not empowered to negotiate the way Joe Biden was, partly because he\u2019s been undercut so many times by POTUS. \u201cThere was an effort, numerous efforts, to engage with the vice president and the president,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.). But \u201cthe president is not persuaded. I don\u2019t know of any president that likes to give up power.\u201d Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) talks with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) before the State of the Union last month. (Mandel Ngan\/AFP\/Getty Images) -- Trump has tried to reframe his power grab not as a constitutional question, but as a matter of national security. \u201cRepublican Senators are overthinking [the] vote on National Emergency,\u201d he tweeted yesterday. \u201cIt is very simply Border Security\/No Crime \u2014 Should not be thought of any other way.\u201d -- But a lot of principled conservatives and libertarians don\u2019t see it that way. Indeed, today\u2019s vote will become a legacy-defining litmus test for many senators who fancy themselves as constitutionalists. \u201cThrough the legal fiction of an emergency, the old rules that governed America, and ensured some democratic check on executive power, are sidelined,\u201d writes National Review\u2019s Michael Brendan Dougherty. \u201cI happen to think Congress should fund more-extensive border security, including fencing. But conservatives have to defend the constitutional order that gives government acts the savor of legitimacy. That means Congress must reassert itself.\u201d -- Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) is in that camp. \u201cI would literally lose my political soul if I decided to treat President Trump different than President Obama,\u201d the senator wrote in an op-ed for Fox News. \u201cEvery single Republican I know decried President Obama\u2019s use of executive power to legislate. We were right then. But the only way to be an honest officeholder is to stand up for the same principles no matter who is in power.\u201d Paul predicts the Supreme Court will \u201clikely\u201d strike down the declaration. \u201cIn fact, I think the president\u2019s own picks to the Supreme Court may rebuke him on this,\u201d he said. \u201cWith regard to the Constitution, the Supreme Court made it very clear in Youngstown Steel in 1952 \u2026 that there are three kinds of executive orders: orders that carry out an expressly voiced congressional position, orders where Congress\u2019 will is unclear, and, finally, orders clearly opposed to the will of Congress. \u2026 Without question, the president\u2019s order for more wall money contradicts the will of Congress. \u2026 My oath is to the Constitution, not to any man or political party.\u201d -- In the Youngstown case that Paul refers to, the Supreme Court blocked Harry Truman from seizing steel mills during the Korean War. In a recent piece for the American Conservative magazine that decried Trump\u2019s declaration, Republican lawyer Bruce Fein \u2014 a veteran of Reagan\u2019s Justice Department \u2014 recalled Robert Jackson\u2019s concurrence in the 1952 case. \u201cWith all its defects, delays and inconveniences, men have discovered no technique for long preserving free government except that the Executive be under the law, and that the law be made by parliamentary deliberations,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cOnly scrupulous adherence to constitutional processes will keep the law supreme in America,\u201d Fein added. -- James Madison, the architect of the Constitution, doesn\u2019t get to vote in the Senate today. But he argued poignantly, and timelessly, in Federalist 58 that Congress having the power of the purse is one of the people\u2019s most important checks on tyranny: \u201cThis power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\u201d WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Beto O\u2019Rourke is officially running for president. The former congressman and failed Senate candidate, who is in Iowa for the next few days, confirmed to the El Paso TV station KTSM\u00a0that he's joining the crowded field. \u201cI'm really proud of what El Paso did and what El Paso represents,\u201d he texted the station last night. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of why I\u2019m running.\u201d -- In his campaign announcement video, O'Rourke struck the same upbeat tone he used when he campaigned against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) last year.\u00a0Jenna Johnson reports: \u201cO\u2019Rourke\u2019s announcement came after months of public reflection that included a solo road trip through rural America, a heart-to-heart talk with Oprah Winfrey and rallying with supporters near the southern border. ... 'The challenges that we face right now, the interconnected crises in our economy, our democracy and our climate, have never been greater, and they will either consume us or they will afford us the greatest opportunity to unleash the genius of the United States of America,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, this moment of peril produces perhaps the greatest moment of promise for this country and for everyone inside of it.'\"\u00a0 -- Cover boy: O\u2019Rourke gets star treatment in next month\u2019s Vanity Fair -- with a photo spread by Annie Leibovitz. O\u2019Rourke\u00a0told writer Joe Hagan that he was \u201cjust born to do this\u201d:\u00a0\u201cSkeptics question whether O\u2019Rourke\u2019s political transcendentalism can sustain the meat grinder of a national election. In a Democratic primary, he will not have the bogeyman of a Trump or a Ted Cruz from which to draw voter energy. He is decidedly not the street fighter many Democrats crave. And in a zero-sum world, his astounding run against Cruz in last year\u2019s Texas Senate race, historic as it was, was still a loss. ... \u201cO\u2019Rourke is acutely aware, too, of perhaps his biggest vulnerability \u2014 being a white man in a Democratic Party yearning for a woman or a person of color. ...\u00a0\u2018The government at all levels is overly represented by white men,\u2019 he says. \u2018That\u2019s part of the problem, and I\u2019m a white man. So if I were to run, I think it\u2019s just so important that those who would comprise my team looked like this country. ...\u00a0I totally understand people who will make a decision based on the fact that almost every single one of our presidents has been a white man, and they want something different for this country. And I think that\u2019s a very legitimate basis upon which to make a decision. Especially in the fact that there are some really great candidates out there right now.\u201d What do Beto\u2019s kids think of him running?

(AP) \u00a0\u00a0 THE UNFRIENDLY SKIES: -- Following days of resistance,\u00a0the FAA issued an emergency order grounding\u00a0Boeing 737 Max 8 and Max 9 jets after the agency received new evidence pointing to similarities between the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia. Luz Lazo, Michael Laris, Lori Aratani and Damian Paletta report: \u201cTrump announced the abrupt about-face Wednesday, after U.S. officials found themselves nearly alone in allowing the planes to remain in the air. As recently as Wednesday morning, both Boeing and the FAA had continued to say it was safe for the planes to fly. ...\u00a0The investigation into the causes of the Ethiopian Airlines crash is in the earliest stages, and it is not clear whether hardware problems, software problems or some combination of factors caused the crash.\u201d -- Here are the issues the Ethiopia\u00a0and Indonesia crashes have in common, per Emily Rauhala:\u00a0 -- Trump privately disparaged the Boeing 737, which he said\u00a0\u201csucked,\u201d before he ordered the grounding.\u00a0Toluse Olorunnipa\u00a0and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cThe president said Boeing 737s paled in comparison to the Boeing 757 ... which he owns as a personal jet. ... He questioned why Boeing would keep building the model and opined that he never would have bought a 737 for the Trump Shuttle, the small airline he briefly ran three decades ago that relied on 727s before going bankrupt.\u00a0...\u00a0Trump added to the confusion Wednesday by suggesting that the decision to ground the plane was 'psychologically'\u00a0important but was neither urgent nor conclusive. ...\u00a0The equivocation reflected an administration that was reluctant to take the step of imposing a nationwide suspension initially opposed by Boeing, the country\u2019s second-largest federal contractor.\u201d\u00a0 Trump should not have been the person making this decision, aviation experts said:\u00a0\u201cTrump was inclined to announce a grounding on Tuesday, but he received pushback from the FAA, which had not yet reached a decision, according to officials familiar with the deliberations. But Trump also equivocated himself, telling advisers that grounding planes would cause panic and could hurt the stock market, according to two people who spoke to him. Federal regulators usually take the lead on making decisions related to safety, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group. 'It\u2019s not the president\u2019s decision and it should never be the president\u2019s decision,' he said, adding that he did not know whether Trump broke any protocols.\u201d -- Trump wanted his personal pilot, John Dunkin, to become the FAA administrator, a position that\u2019s remained vacant since Barack Obama\u2019s appointee finished his term in January 2018. The absence of an FAA leader has been noticeable amid the Boeing fallout. Following an inquiry from The Washington Post, the White House declined to say whether Trump is still considering Dunkin for the job, or whether he plans to nominate someone in light of the pressure facing the agency. (Isaac Stanley-Becker) -- Wednesday's order grounds more than 70 U.S. aircraft. The Max 8 planes\u00a0are used by American and Southwest airlines, which have a combined 58 of them in their fleets. United Airlines has 14 of the planes in its fleet. -- In\u00a0November, a group of\u00a0pilots\u00a0met with Boeing executives to raise concerns about the 737 jet and complain\u00a0about being left in the dark on some of the plane's new software. The meeting happened shortly after the Lion Air flight crashed off the coast of Indonesia. Aaron Gregg, Jonathan O'Connell, Andrew Ba Tran and Faiz Siddiqui report: \u201cAfter the crash, Boeing issued a bulletin disclosing that this line of planes, known as the 737 Max 8, was equipped with a new type of software as part of the plane\u2019s automated functions. Some pilots were furious that they were not told about the new software when the plane was unveiled. Dennis Tajer, a 737 captain who attended the meeting with Boeing executives, recalled, 'They said, \u2018Look, we didn\u2019t include it because we have a lot of people flying on this and we didn\u2019t want to inundate you with information.\u2019\u00a0...\u00a0Tajer said that the 737 training Boeing offered before the Lion Air crash involved an iPad course that took less than an hour to complete. ... \u201cThe software, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), can in some rare but dangerous situations override pilot control inputs unless it is switched off. This can interfere with pilots\u2019 longtime training that pulling back on the control yoke raises a plane\u2019s nose, putting the plane into a climb. That means that as a pilot tries to maneuver an airplane, the automated system may be counteracting that pilot\u2019s inputs.\u201d -- After the Ethio\u00adpian crash on Sunday, Boeing said it would update flight-control software, something it might have done sooner if not for the government shutdown.\u00a0The company and the FAA had been working to hash out the update but it was delayed because of the longest shutdown in U.S. history and differences of opinion, per the\u00a0Wall Street Journal's Andrew Tangel and Andy Pasztor: \u201cU.S. aviation regulators are expected to mandate the change by the end of April.\u201d Matthew Whitaker \"did not deny\" talking to Trump about Cohen, according to a House Democrat. (Jonathan Ernst\/Reuters) THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\u00a0 -- During a closed-door interview with the House Judiciary Committee, former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker \u201cdid not deny\u201d that he and Trump personally discussed the government's case against his former lawyer Michael Cohen, according to\u00a0Democratic chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.). Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201c\u2018Unlike in the hearing room, Mr. Whitaker did not deny that the president called him to discuss the Michael Cohen case and personnel decisions in the Southern District,\u2019 Nadler said following his meeting with Whitaker on Wednesday, referring to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York, which brought the case against Cohen. \u2026 \u201cAccording to Nadler, Whitaker did not deny that he had been 'directly involved in conversations about whether to fire one or more U.S. attorneys.' He also did not deny that he had been 'involved in conversations about the scope' of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman\u2019s recusal from the Cohen case, Nadler said, and whether subordinate prosecutors at the Southern District of New York 'went too far' pursuing the campaign finance case in which Cohen has implicated Trump. \u201cThe committee\u2019s ranking Republican, Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), who was present for Wednesday\u2019s interview with Whitaker, called Nadler\u2019s summary an 'interpretation'\u00a0and 'overreach,' while a Republican staff lawyer also present for the meeting said Whitaker simply could not remember ever conversing with Trump about Cohen\u2019s case.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Wednesday\u2019s meeting was not transcribed, complicating the matter of resolving Nadler\u2019s and Collins\u2019s diverging interpretations of Whitaker\u2019s account. But Whitaker\u2019s non-denials are raising questions among Trump\u2019s critics about whether his public testimony was accurate.\u201d\u00a0 -- Paul Manafort was sentenced to a total of nearly eight years in prison for conspiracy and fraud. Spencer S. Hsu, Rachel Weiner and Ann E. Marimow: \u201cIn federal court Wednesday, Judge Amy Berman Jackson criticized Manafort and his attorneys for repeatedly casting his hard fall from power as collateral damage from the special counsel\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. \u2026 For Manafort\u2019s crimes of illegally lobbying in Ukraine and hiding the proceeds overseas, then encouraging witnesses to lie on his behalf, Jackson\u2019s terms added 43 months to the 47 months he received in Alexandria federal court last week for bank and tax fraud. Her total sentence was 73 months in the D.C. case, but Jackson said 30 of those would overlap with the tally in Virginia. \u2026 Asked if he would pardon Manafort, Trump said, \u2018I have not even given it a thought, as of this moment. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s right now on my mind.\u2019\u201d -- Just minutes after Jackson handed down the sentence, a New York grand jury indicted Manafort on charges of residential mortgage fraud \u2014 charges that fall outside Trump\u2019s pardon power. Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report: \u201cUnder the Constitution, presidents have wide authority to pardon, but that power applies only to federal convictions, not state cases. \u2026 New York State Attorney General Letitia James has urged the legislature to fix what Democrats call a \u2018double-jeopardy loophole\u2019 in state law that could negate New York\u2019s ability to prosecute anyone pardoned by the president. \u2026 New York lawmakers were working this week to undo the pardon loophole. \u2026 The state charges could be challenged in the courts as a violation of double jeopardy protections for defendants, an area in which current New York law may favor Manafort.\u201d -- A top prosecutor on Bob Mueller\u2019s team is stepping down from the Justice Department, the latest and maybe biggest clue that the special counsel's investigation might soon wrap up. NPR\u2019s Carrie Johnson reports: \u201cAndrew Weissmann, the architect of the case against Manafort, will study and teach at New York University and work on a variety of public service projects, including his longstanding interest in preventing wrongful convictions by shoring up forensic science standards used in courts.\u201d\u00a0 -- Introducing a new character in this saga: Robert Costello, a\u00a0New York lawyer with connections to Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, told Michael Cohen in an April 2018 email that he could \u201csleep well tonight\u201d because he had \u201cfriends in high places\u201d \u2014\u00a0though he did not specifically mention a possible pardon from the president,\u00a0CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger and Jeremy Herb report: \u201cCohen, in his closed-door congressional testimony, has provided these emails in an effort to corroborate his claim that a pardon was dangled before he decided to cooperate with federal prosecutors, according to sources familiar with his testimony. \u2026 But the attorney who wrote those emails, Robert Costello, told CNN that Cohen's interpretation of events is \u2018utter nonsense.\u2019 Costello said that Cohen asked him to raise the issue of a pardon with Giuliani.\u201d -- Costello said he's preparing to deliver all the emails to federal prosecutors at the U.S. attorney's office, which requested them after CNN's story.\u00a0Colby Itkowitz and Matt Zapotosky report: Costello \u201caccused Cohen or his lawyer of having \u2018selectively\u2019 leaked copies of their email exchanges \u2018to bolster the false narrative that they originally tried to peddle in the media last week.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018This statement: \u2018Sleep Well tonight, you have friends in high places\u2019 was a tongue-in-cheek reference to a Garth Brooks song, to a client whose state of mind was highly disturbed and had suggested to us that he was suicidal. We were simply trying to be decent human beings. There is no hidden message,\u2019 Costello said.\u00a0 -- Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) rejected calls from House Republicans for an investigation into whether Cohen lied to Congress during his testimony two weeks ago. The Oversight chairman, however, left open the possibility of further action against Trump\u2019s former lawyer if new evidence of perjury is uncovered.\u00a0 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have been tapping into a privately maintained database of license plates. (Marlon Correa\/The Washington Post) THE REST OF THE AGENDA:\u00a0 -- Immigration agents have been tapping into a vast and privately maintained database of license plate numbers gathered from vehicles across the nation to track immigrants who may be in the United States\u00a0illegally. Drew Harwell and Tony Romm report: \u201cThe records the ACLU obtained from the Department of Homeland Security through a Freedom of Information Act request shed new light on a little-noticed and expanding network of surveillance that has developed over the years and for which there appear to be few legal limitations. \u2026 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s use of some of the information in states including California also appears to skirt limitations that \u2018sanctuary cities\u2019 have placed on police cooperation with the immigration agency, the ACLU said. \u2026 ICE spokesman Matthew Bourke said that agents use the license-plate database as a tool to help in its immigration-enforcement investigations and that it does not use the information to track people \u2018who have no connection to ICE investigatory or enforcement activities.\u2019\u201d -- For its upcoming mission to the moon, NASA is considering using commercial alternatives instead of the long-delayed rocket it\u2019s been working on for years.

(Seung Min Kim) Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaks in Parliament ahead of the latest\u00a0Brexit vote. (Jessica Taylor\/Reuters)\u00a0 THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- The British Parliament rejected a no-deal departure twice, signaling that lawmakers are\u00a0likely to ask the other 27 members of the European Union\u00a0for permission to delay Brexit. William Booth, Karla Adam and Michael Birnbaum report: \u201cThe no-deal votes were in many ways symbolic \u2014 taking the temperature of Parliament, rather than setting concrete policy. \u2026 [Prime Minister Theresa] May said her government could ask the E.U. for a short extension to implement a deal if it passed by next week. If no deal is passed, May said she would be forced to seek a much longer delay. \u2026 A longer delay would require Britain to participate in European Parliament elections in May.\u201d -- The Pentagon is preparing to test missiles that have been banned by the INF Treaty. Paul Sonne reports: \u201cThe U.S. military plans to test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range of about 600 miles in August and a midrange ballistic missile with a range of about 1,800 to 2,500 miles in November \u2026 The testing, production and deployment of missiles with those ranges is prohibited by the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. But Trump withdrew from the treaty on Feb. 1 and triggered a formal six-month wait period before the final expiry of the agreement this summer. \u2026 Washington has said Moscow is already deploying a missile that violates the agreement and cited that weapon as a reason for its withdrawal from the pact. The Kremlin has denied that accusation.\u201d\u00a0 -- The United States\u00a0and the Taliban have drafted an agreement on the withdrawal of American troops and the Taliban\u2019s pledge to cut ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. NBC News\u2019s\u00a0Dan De Luce reports: \u201cThe talks between the Taliban insurgents and U.S. diplomats have lasted longer than any previous American attempt at negotiation with the militants since American troops entered Afghanistan in 2001. But it's unclear if the Afghan government and other Afghan political leaders will be ready to embrace the tentative deal worked out by [U.S. presidential envoy] Zalmay Khalilzad. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has expressed concerns that the Kabul government could be left out in the cold unless the Taliban agrees to meet face-to-face with his government.\u201d\u00a0 -- Power has been restored to Venezuela following nearly a week of darkness, according to the country\u2019s information minister. At its worst, the power outage left 19 out of 23 states without energy. (CNN) -- The outage left the country\u2019s second-largest city, Maracaibo, devastated as looters broke into hundreds of businesses. The AP\u2019s Sheyla Urdaneta reports. -- Ten of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most prominent women\u2019s rights activists appeared in court in Riyadh for the start of a trial that could signal whether the government will roll back an aggressive crackdown on political activists. Kareem Fahim reports: \u201cMany of the women have been tortured while in custody, according to relatives and human rights groups. Saudi officials deny those allegations. \u2026 ALQST, a Saudi rights group based in London, said Wednesday that the women are being charged under the country\u2019s Cyber Crime law with offenses related to their activism, including contacting human rights groups. The charges carry sentences of up to five years in prison.\u201d\u00a0 -- This \u201csham trial\u201d exposes Saudi Arabia\u2019s disrespect for its citizens, writes Hala Al-Dosari, a Saudi activist and scholar and The Washington Post\u2019s first Jamal Khashoggi fellow: \u201cThe women have been subjected to horrific torture and sexual harassment, but in a statement the government claimed the accused were enjoying their full rights. Meanwhile, state-linked social media accounts have already virtually convicted the activists and are asking for the maximum punishment. ... Against this background, Saudi Arabia decided to appoint its first female ambassador to the United States, Princess Reema bint Bandar. It\u2019s another opportunity to push an apologetic reform narrative amid U.S. congressional scrutiny and pressure. Many will take the bait, as they did when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first came to power. In our collective conscience as a nation, these female activists facing trial \u2014 and the men who support them \u2014 were instrumental in influencing reforms.\u201d\u00a0 -- Gary Cohn, Trump\u2019s former economic adviser, said the president is \u201cdesperate\u201d for a trade deal with China.\u00a0David J. Lynch reports: \u201c\u2019The president needs a win,\u2019 Cohn said in an interview with Freakonomics, a public radio show and podcast.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Cohn said he supported the president\u2019s desire to crack down on unfair Chinese trade practices, but he said tariffs \u2018don\u2019t work.\u2019 As evidence, he pointed to last year\u2019s\u00a0record $891 billion trade deficit in merchandise\u00a0and the record $419 billion gap in trade with China. \u2018So tariffs were used as the threat. Did it hurt the Chinese at all? We had record trade deficits,\u2019 Cohn said.\u201d Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz often talks about growing up in a public housing project.\u00a0(Joe Raedle\/Getty Images) GET TO KNOW HOWARD SCHULTZ:\u00a0 -- Billionaire Howard Schultz often talks at length about his experience growing up as in a Brooklyn public housing building, describing it as \u201clow-income\u201d housing where fights \u201cdidn\u2019t typically escalate to deadly violence, but they were tough in their own way.\u201d But his description of Bayview as a rough, low-income community doesn\u2019t match the city\u2019s definition of the project. Marc Fisher reports: \u201c\u2018It was a shiny, wonderful world,\u2019 said former Bayview resident Elyse Maltz, one of many residents of the development who contend that Schultz, 65, has distorted the reality of the place where they grew up in the 1950s and \u201960s. \u2018Everything was brand spanking new.\u2019 Maltz ... [said Bayview] \u2018was middle-class, not lower middle. You were interviewed to get in. My family was pretty well off. I know Howard wants to look like he\u2019s rags to riches, but we had a wonderful, plentiful life. I mean, my ma had a cleaning lady. We really didn\u2019t lack for anything.\u2019 \u2026\u00a0 \u201cIn 1956, the New York City Housing Authority opened Bayview as a \u2018moderate income\u2019 development, built a block away from Jamaica Bay \u2026 Superficially, Bayview looked much like any city housing development, a collection of brick towers with balky stainless-steel elevators and hallways of green linoleum floors and glazed, aqua-tiled walls. But Bayview, which Schultz\u2019s family moved into in its opening year, was built as a \u2018no cash subsidy\u2019 project, according to city records. That meant that unlike developments subsidized by the federal or state government, Bayview had minimum income requirements for tenants, charged higher rents intended to cover the entire cost of its mortgage, and was \u2018built to high standards compared to [federal] projects,\u2019 according to \u2018Affordable Housing in New York,\u2019 a history of public housing in the city.\u201d\u00a0 -- In a speech to Miami Dade College detailing how he would run the government, Schultz vowed that he would not sign bills that aren\u2019t passed with bipartisan support and said he will nominate only Supreme Court justices who could be confirmed by two-thirds of the Senate \u2014 a naive statement for anyone who has been watching the judicial wars.\u00a0Michael Scherer reports: \u201c\u2018The courts have become yet another battlefield in the ongoing war between Democratic and Republican leaders,\u2019 Schultz said. \u2018These battles have undermined our faith in the rule of law and the impartiality of the entire judicial system. All of this has to change.\u2019 He said he would fill his cabinet with Democrats, Republicans and Independents, including \u2018a greater share of women than any previous president.\u2019 \u2026 He promised to work to end the practice of partisan gerrymandering, drawing legislative and congressional districts to preserve one party\u2019s power. That process is controlled by the states, not Washington, but Schultz said he would push for independent commissions to draw those districts in the future.\u201d -- Big Democratic donors are sending their money to four key states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida and Pennsylvania. The\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u2019s Julie Bykowicz reports: \u201cTwo of the Democrats\u2019 best-funded outside groups \u2014 both of which are backed in part by New York billionaire George Soros \u2014 are planning at least a $130 million campaign to attack President Trump and build support for Democrats in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida, where Mr. Trump narrowly prevailed over Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. A third group, an $80 million voter-engagement effort, is at work in these and three other battleground states. \u2026 The latest Democratic spending commitment comes from opposition research group American Bridge 21st Century, which plans to put at least $30 million largely into the four states.\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Conservative lawyer George Conway, the husband of top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, called Trump a \u201cpathological\u201d liar after the president falsely insisted that the judge in Manafort\u2019s case cleared him of collusion. \u201cIt\u2019s not rational, because it\u2019s a lie that no reasonable person would believe,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt undermines his credibility.

In prior years, lobbyists and consultants felt compelled to work officials in all corners of the federal bureaucracy when trying to shape policy. But now, with decision-making consolidated inside the Oval Office, they\u2019ve had to rewrite their playbook. \u2018It\u2019s two different worlds,\u2019 says Eric Bovim, a managing director of Signal Group, a public-affairs agency in Washington. \u2018Under President Obama, the government was a finely tuned instrument, all the parts working together to produce a single note. You needed to work with everybody to calibrate the sound. Today, for the most part, it\u2019s a one-man band, the President in a never-ending guitar solo on the White House lawn, overpowering all the other instruments.\u2019\u201d -- New York Times, \u201cInside the Pricey, Totally Legal World of College Consultants,\u201d by Dana Goldstein and Jack Healy: \u201cThe government\u2019s indictments of dozens of parents, college administrators and coaches exposed an ugly array of corrupt and illegal admissions practices. But there is also a perfectly legal world of gaming the college admissions process by doing everything from picking advanced classes, choosing the right sport, giving donations and turning to the multibillion-dollar industry of test prep, college essay editing and advice on how to produce the perfect application. Every aspect of a teenager\u2019s life can be managed and shaped into a persona catered to please the exacting eye of a college admissions officer. Parents might pay $300 for a standard, hourlong consultation with an admissions expert or donate tens of millions to schools, with the hope of winning special consideration for their child\u2019s bid for a spot at a top school.\u201d\u00a0 -- The Atlantic, \u201cAn Abandoned Baby\u2019s DNA Condemns His Mother,\u201d by Sarah Zhang: \u201cThirty-eight years ago, an infant boy \u2014 hours old, tears frozen on his face \u2014 was found dead in a ditch in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Many of these groups meet online or on private property, rather than in actual churches, since they\u2019re limited by local laws about public consumption. The International Church of Cannabis is the rare one where you can actually smoke in the church itself, provided you\u2019re at least 21, show ID at the door, and have completed the aforementioned online questionnaire.

'Why was the bank involved in the caging of children and financing the caging of children to begin with?' she asked, referring to the separation of families at the U.S.-Mexico border under President Trump\u2019s controversial\u00a0immigration policy.\u00a0Sloan responded, 'I don\u2019t know how to answer that question, because we weren\u2019t.' ...\u00a0Sloan acknowledged that Wells Fargo provided financing for two firms that run detention facilities used by the government, with one of those partnerships still active.

Those subpoenas signal a significant new inquiry by state regulators into the Trump Organization\u2019s financing. The subpoena follows congressional testimony by Michael Cohen \u2014 Trump\u2019s former lawyer and longtime self-proclaimed \u201cfixer\u201d \u2014 that Trump inflated his net worth in documents he sent to Deutsche Bank while seeking loans. The German bank also was crucial to Trump\u2019s real estate business in the last few years before he ran for president, lending him more than $360\u00a0million since 2012. The loans let Trump buy new properties and refinance old ones, despite his history of corporate bankruptcies and disputes with lenders. In all cases, the loans came not from Deutsche Bank\u2019s main commercial lending division, but rather from a smaller office of the bank that manages money for high-net-worth clients. Deutsche Bank had already received requests for documents from the House\u2019s Financial Services and Intelligence committees. This new inquiry seems to signal that New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) is investigating the same loans. A spokeswoman for James declined to comment Tuesday. The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment. Deutsche Bank issued a statement Tuesday saying only, \u201cWe remain committed to cooperating with authorized investigations.\u201d Just last week, another New York agency \u2014 the Department of Financial Services, which oversees insurance \u2014 issued a subpoena to Trump\u2019s longtime insurance broker, Aon. Cohen had testified that Trump had used the same kind of inflated financial statements in attempting to lower his insurance premiums. The Deutsche Bank subpoenas were for documents related to three Trump properties, all bought with loans from the bank, the two people confirmed. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal details of the documents. Trump got $125\u00a0million to buy the Doral golf resort outside Miami. He got $170\u00a0million to create Trump International Hotel inside a federally owned building in Washington. And he got about $69\u00a0million from the bank in 2014 to refinance old Deutsche Bank loans on Trump\u2019s tower in Chicago. In addition, the people said, the subpoena asks for documents related to Trump\u2019s attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills in 2013 \u2014 a deal that did not materialize. During his congressional testimony last month, Cohen provided copies of \u201cstatements of financial condition,\u201d which he said were sent to Deutsche Bank in pursuit of a loan for that purchase. \u201cDid the president ever provide inflated assets to a bank in order to help them to obtain a loan?\u201d Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) asked Cohen. \u201cThese documents and others were provided to Deutsche Bank on one occasion when I was with him in our attempt to obtain money so that we can put a bid on the Buffalo Bills,\u201d Cohen said. The \u201cstatements of financial condition\u201d are not rigorously audited documents. According to a cover letter on one of the files obtained by The Washington Post, they represented Trump\u2019s own estimates about what he was worth and what he owed. Cohen said these statements exaggerated the income Trump received from commercial properties. They also included a valuation of one property \u2014 a mansion Trump owns in suburban New York \u2014 at $291\u00a0million, when local assessors put the value around $19\u00a0million. In one statement from 2013, Trump doubled his own estimate of his net worth by declaring that his name brand alone was worth $4\u00a0billion. The subpoenas issued Monday were first reported by the New York Times. The Times also reported that Investors Bank, a New Jersey institution, had been subpoenaed for a 2010 loan it extended to the Trump Organization related to Trump Park Avenue, a residential building in Manhattan. That bank did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday. Deutsche Bank became one of Trump\u2019s main lenders over the last 12\u00a0years \u2014 a time when Trump was trying to shake off corporate bankruptcies and return to his previous fame as an ambitious real estate developer. Before this period, Trump had called himself \u201cthe king of debt\u201d for his use of bank mortgages to pay for audacious purchases and projects. But that strategy backfired at times: Trump suffered through a debt-fueled financial collapse in the early 1990s, and corporate bankruptcies. He even sued Deutsche Bank in 2008, during the financial crisis, to avoid making payments on a large loan related to the Chicago tower. After that, Trump changed his strategies. He began buying many properties in cash, without any public record that he\u2019d borrowed the money. And, when he did borrow money, his financial-disclosure forms show, he relied heavily on three lenders. One was Ladder Capital Finance, a New York investment firm that employs the son of Trump\u2019s longtime aide Allen Weisselberg. That company largely lent Trump money to refinance existing commercial buildings in New York. Then there was Deutsche Bank, where the private-wealth office funded new projects and refinanced the troubled tower in Chicago. Trump\u2019s other big lender during this period, according to his financial-disclosure documents, was an unusual company called Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC. Trump\u2019s disclosure document says he owes this company more than $50\u00a0million, due to a 2012 transaction involving the Chicago tower. But Trump himself owns Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC. His company has declined to answer questions about how \u2014 and why \u2014 Trump came to owe more than $50\u00a0million to himself.","69":"It\u2019s open season on the wealthy. Resentment of the rich, lately a feature of the populist right, is sizzling on the populist left, too, with the premise that \u201cevery billionaire is a policy mistake.\u201d The impulse underlying that slogan is right. Over the past decades, the gap between rich and poor has widened in this country, and the next president and Congress should take steps to reverse that trend. But people should think twice before seeking to flatten every tycoon. It may seem counterintuitive, but billionaires can be good for democracy, and a bulwark against tyranny. To understand why, think back in history \u2014 precisely two years back. Or rather, think back to what has happened since then. The greatest fear in February 2017 was not of plutocrats but of a challenge to our constitutional norms. A newly inaugurated president was attacking the judiciary and the media. He seemed intent on bending the civil service to his will by discrediting it as the \u201cdeep state.\u201d He appointed a commission to generate phony evidence of voter fraud that he would, presumably, use to enact changes in voting law to perpetuate his party\u2019s rule. He was preparing to manipulate the census for the same reason. His Justice Department was using its awesome power to try to block a merger advantageous to a cable network he loathed. The Republican-controlled Congress played along, staging phony investigations of federal law enforcement. It even enacted a wealth tax, well before Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) proposed hers \u2014 but its was a tax on the endowments of rich private universities, which Republicans saw as a bastion of liberal resistance. Today, having captured the House and feeling optimistic about 2020, Democrats are focused more on how they might wield power than on Trump\u2019s potential abuse of it. And maybe the threat to democracy has receded. I think it\u2019s a bit soon to relax \u2014 and certainly, before we move on, we should think about what will have given American democracy its resilience if it does emerge from this trial. One piece of that answer \u2014 not the only one, by any means, but an important one \u2014 is our deeply entrenched, richly diverse civil society. Those private universities with the self-confidence that big endowments can bestow. Politically diverse think tanks that propagate ideas from governments-in-waiting while providing some accountability for the one in power now. An equally diverse array of media. Nonprofit foundations, testing and promoting policies that the government may not favor. Other democracies envy the United States for this vibrant, independent, thickly muscled web of institutions and its check on government overreach. And these institutions would not exist but for the generosity of those billionaires and their millionaire fellows. Not surprisingly, our feelings about this tend to vary by the case. Liberals are not happy when Murdochs or Mercers build up right-wing media but may look more kindly on progressive magnates saving or creating publications old (the Atlantic) or new (the Intercept). To state the obvious, we at The Post feel fortunate to have a wealthy owner, Jeffrey P. Bezos, who has given us the space and time to find our footing in the digital age. Similarly, some liberals may resent the Koch brothers advocating smaller government but feel differently when George Soros advocates the decriminalization of marijuana. There is in fact a long tradition of tycoons using their wealth to promote policies or foster research where government is absent or opposed. Some of their obsessions are wacky and fall by the wayside. Others end up having staying power and positive effects: Andrew Carnegie\u2019s free lending libraries, Julius Rosenwald\u2019s schools for black children in the Jim Crow South, Bill and Melinda Gates\u2019s promotion of vaccines and other public-health measures that have saved millions of lives. I\u2019m not suggesting that most rich people are selfless or far-sighted. No doubt the rapacious Washington football team owner whose recent purchase of a $100 million superyacht caught Warren\u2019s eye is more typical than are Bill Gates or Warren Buffett, who have pledged to give their fortunes away. The rich, virtuous or not, certainly shouldn\u2019t be allowed to own the political debate, which is why we need public financing of elections, fuller disclosure of contributions and other campaign finance reform. And for the richest 1 percent of Americans to own 40 percent of the nation\u2019s wealth, up from 33 percent in 1962, is corrosive and unhealthy. A wealth tax may be unconstitutional and impractical, but you could promote greater equality with such measures as beefing up the estate tax, taxing capital gains at the same rate as other income and imposing a progressive consumption tax. But we should also remember that private wealth over the generations has endowed our society with independent centers of power and thought that help protect our liberty.

Barr\u2019s nomination to be attorney general this year was whether, once he got the job, he would do President Trump\u2019s bidding. Barr had made statements critical of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation, and he even wrote a long memo rejecting the need for the obstruction of justice portion of Mueller\u2019s inquiry. Trump also repeatedly made clear his desire for a loyalist to oversee the investigation. On Sunday, Barr made a big decision in Trump\u2019s favor. And he did so in a way legal experts say is very questionable. In his four-page letter describing the report\u2019s major findings, Barr noted that Mueller didn\u2019t conclude that Trump committed obstruction of justice but that Mueller also said, pointedly, that he wasn\u2019t exonerating Trump either. Then Barr stepped forward to offer his own exoneration. \u201cAfter reviewing the Special Counsel\u2019s final report on these issues; consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions,\u201d Barr wrote, \u201cDeputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\u201d He further explained. \u201cIn making this determination, we noted that the Special Counsel recognized that \u2018the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,\u2019 and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President\u2019s intent with respect to obstruction.\u201d There are a few reasons this conclusion is problematic. The first is Barr\u2019s rationale. Legal experts say it\u2019s odd that he emphasized the lack of an underlying, proven crime, given that\u2019s not necessary for obstruction of justice. \u201cI think this is the weakest part of Attorney General Barr\u2019s conclusions,\u201d said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. \u201cYou do not need to prove an underlying crime to prove obstruction of justice. Martha Stewart is quite aware of this fact.\u201d \u201cFor example,\u201d added former federal prosecutor David Alan Sklansky, now of Stanford University, \u201cif the President wrongfully tried to block the investigation into Russian interference in the election because he wanted to protect the Russians, or because he didn\u2019t want people to know that a foreign government had tried to hack the election in his favor, that would constitute obstruction.\u201d Gene Rossi, another former federal prosecutor, said the lack of an underlying crime does matter. \u201cHowever, the existence of an underlying crime is not an essential element of the crime of obstruction. End of story,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the extent the attorney general suggests such an element, he is dead wrong.\u201d It\u2019s important to note that Barr doesn\u2019t quite say this means there can\u2019t be obstruction of justice, but it is a point of emphasis. But even then, is it really true? Although Mueller determined that there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, he was able to charge and prove other crimes by Trump associates. Former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States, and Trump allegedly requested that then-FBI Director James B. Comey be lenient on Flynn. That\u2019s an actual crime Trump could be trying to cover up. The same goes for longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone, who has been indicted in connection with attempts to contact WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign. Stone\u2019s indictment notably said that \u201ca senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact STONE\u201d about the matter. Some have suggested that it might be Trump who did that directing. Even if it wasn\u2019t, Mueller clearly sees an actual crime here, which Trump\u2019s actions vis-a-vis his investigation could affect. Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was sentenced to 7\u00bd years in prison. Former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen got three. Cohen has implicated Trump in Cohen\u2019s felony campaign finance violations, and Trump has engaged in very public conduct that some have alleged was meant to intimidate Cohen as he testified before Congress. Barr\u2019s argument is that the lack of an underlying crime suggests there\u2019s less reason to believe Trump had a \u201ccorrupt intent\u201d behind his actions regarding the investigation. But if you set aside collusion, there would seem to be plenty for Trump to want to cover up. Even if these proven and alleged crimes didn\u2019t involve criminal activity by Trump personally, he would seem to have a clear interest in the outcomes of these investigations, both because of his sensitivity about the idea that Russia assisted him and because of the narrative it created of a president surrounded by corruption. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be guilty of an underlying crime to obstruct an investigation \u2014 especially one that might, and in fact did, implicate a number of close associates and aides,\u201d said Jens David Ohlin, a law professor at Cornell University. And the last point is that this is not a determination Barr necessarily needed to make. Justice Department guidelines say that a sitting president can\u2019t be indicted, so as attorney general, Barr\u2019s conclusions about Mueller\u2019s report weren\u2019t really needed. Congress is the ultimate arbiter here, through potential impeachment proceedings. The fact that Mueller opted not to make a specific recommendation on obstruction of justice may have convinced Barr to weigh in, but he could have just left it at Mueller opting not to accuse Trump of a crime. Instead, Barr made a determination based on reviewing Mueller\u2019s report for less than 48 hours. In doing so, he invited Democrats to accuse him of going above and beyond for the man who appointed him \u2014 and who had, for months and months before then, very publicly resented the fact that his previous attorney general, Jeff Sessions, had recused himself from the investigation. Ultimately, Congress will make its own determinations, and Democrats have signaled that they are not going to let this lie. But Barr\u2019s statement is an important one when it comes to whether Republicans would ever go along with impeaching or removing Trump \u2014 and whether voters might support Trump in 2020. This is what Barr\u2019s critics feared when the Senate voted to confirm him two months ago. It\u2019s why they urged him to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. And it\u2019s going to be a significant point of contention in the hours and days ahead.","71":"Michael Cohen, Donald Trump\u2019s fixer turned vocal adversary, has swapped out his attorneys, one of his representatives said Monday, asserting that Cohen wanted new representation as he navigates testifying in various congressional inquiries. Lanny J. Davis, one of Cohen\u2019s lawyers who also has served as his media representative, said in a statement that Cohen is bringing on Michael Monico and Barry Spevack \u2014 two veteran Chicago-based lawyers from the firm Monico and Spevack \u2014 to replace Guy Petrillo and Amy Lester, who had represented him as he went through proceedings in federal court in Manhattan. A person familiar with the matter said Cohen had fallen behind in his bills to Petrillo and Lester, although Davis disputed that this led to the change. \u201cThat\u2019s not the reason,\u201d Davis said. Pressed on whether Cohen was up to date in making payments, he added, \u201cI\u2019m not commenting on his current status in paying his bills.\u201d On Monday, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Cohen had agreed to appear voluntarily before the House Intelligence Committee on Feb.\u00a08 for nonpublic testimony. He already had been issued a subpoena to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee, also a closed-door session, and is expected to do so Feb.\u00a012, Davis has said. Cohen had been scheduled to appear in public before a third panel \u2014 the House Oversight Committee \u2014 that same month but backed out last week, citing threats from President Trump and his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, as well as \u201cadvice of counsel.\u201d Trump has been publicly critical of Cohen for his cooperation with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, called Cohen a \u201crat\u201d and suggested that his \u00adfather-in-law ought to be investigated. Cohen has pleaded guilty in two separate criminal cases in federal court in Manhattan \u2014 one in which he admitted engineering payments, in violation of campaign finance laws, to women to keep quiet about alleged affairs with Trump and another in which he admitted to lying to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow that he pursued during the heart of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. He was sentenced in December to three years in federal prison. Cohen has been cooperating with law enforcement, including Mueller, and has aired some of Trump\u2019s dirty laundry during public court proceedings. He asserted, for example, that Trump directed him in the campaign finance violations and that he had been \u201cliving in a personal and mental incarceration\u201d since going to work for the real estate mogul. Lawmakers, though, have sought to call him as a witness in their own inquiries, hoping he will be able to reveal even more before he is scheduled to report to prison March\u00a06. Cohen\u2019s bringing on Monico and Spevack will mark the third iteration of his legal team. He was first represented by Stephen M. Ryan \u2014 who helped him prepare the congressional testimony that Cohen ultimately admitted was deceitful \u2014 before switching to Petrillo and Lester. Petrillo, a veteran of the federal prosecutor\u2019s office in Manhattan, was viewed as someone who could help Cohen navigate that office\u2019s investigations. Monico is a former federal prosecutor in Illinois, and Spevack is a criminal defense attorney with nearly four decades of experience. In a statement released by Davis, the two said: \u201cWe look forward to helping Mr. Cohen fulfill what he has told us is his only mission \u2014 to tell the truth as he knows it and to turn the corner on his past life and taking ownership for his past mistakes by cooperating as best as he can with all governmental authorities in search of the truth.\u201d","72":"Americans will see Wednesday just why President Trump and his cronies freaked out when the FBI raided his ex-attorney and fixer Michael Cohen\u2019s office and home. In testimony to the House Oversight Committee, Cohen is spilling the proverbial beans and in the process burying his former boss. Cohen\u2019s written statement set the stage. He described Trump in unsparing terms: \u201cHe is a racist. He is a con man. He is a cheat. He was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails.\u201d And there was the first blockbuster: Cohen\u2019s direct eyewitness to a telephone conversation between Stone and Trump wherein Stone previewed the WikiLeaks release of stolen emails. \u201cIn July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump\u2019s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone,\u201d Cohen said in his written statement. \u201cMr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201d Stone added, \u201cMr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of \u2018wouldn\u2019t that be great.\u2019\u201d Understand what Cohen is saying: Trump encouraged an associate to keep abreast and feed him information on WikiLeaks and the release of hacked documents. This not only smacks of conspiracy but also reportedly contradicts Trump\u2019s answers to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s written questions. Cohen\u2019s next blockbuster came with receipts, or more accurately, a check. He told the committee: I am giving the Committee today a copy of the $130,000 wire transfer from me to Ms. Clifford\u2019s attorney during the closing days of the presidential campaign that was demanded by Ms. Clifford to maintain her silence about her affair with Mr. Trump. This is Exhibit 4 to my testimony. Mr. Trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a Home Equity Line of Credit to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign. I did that, too \u2014 without bothering to consider whether that was improper, much less whether it was the right thing to do or how it would impact me, my family, or the public.\u00a0 I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later. As Exhibit 5 to my testimony shows, I am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank account ... This evidence directly contradicts Trump\u2019s original denial of any knowledge of the payments. (He has since effectively admitted to knowing about the payments.) This puts some meat on the bones of prosecutors\u2019 allegation that Trump directed Cohen to violate campaign finance laws. Cohen released a third bombshell: While Trump never said to Cohen, \u201cPlease lie,\u201d Cohen paints a damning picture of Trump\u2019s assumption that Cohen would back up his own false statements. (\u201cIn conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there\u2019s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie.\u201d) Cohen also claims Trump\u2019s lawyers vetted false testimony. If these lawyers knew Trump and Cohen were lying, they were suborning perjury; if they were instructed by Trump simply to make certain there were no contradictions, Trump would have been using unwitting go-betweens to shape false testimony. And that brings us to a fourth bombshell: There were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa Caucus in January 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me \u201cHow\u2019s it going in Russia?\u201d \u2014 referring to the Moscow Tower project. You need to know that Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. To be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project. This is the first time we\u2019ve heard details as to how closely Trump was following the Moscow Tower deal. In essence, Trump defrauded voters by concealing his selfish motive to make money, a scheme that would have required the approval of Russian President Vladimir Putin. This explains much of his appalling defense of Putin during the campaign, and may be the reason he and others continued to lie about contacts with Russia. Knowledge of a personal business deal Trump wanted to conceal from voters gave Russia leverage over Trump. Finally, Cohen suggested Trump engaged in bank fraud. \u201cAs previously stated, I\u2019m giving the Committee today three years of President Trump\u2019s financial statements, from 2011-2013, which he gave to Deutsche Bank to inquire about a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills and to Forbes,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIt was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes. I am sharing with you two newspaper articles, side by side, that are examples of Mr. Trump inflating and deflating his assets, as I said, to suit his financial interests.\u201d Whether these or other materials can demonstrate Trump committed financial crimes is unknown, but they surely must be the subject of ongoing investigation by the prosecutors of the Southern District of New York. In short, Cohen is providing evidence of lies and sleazy practices, but also of concrete crimes. As a felon, Cohen\u2019s credibility will be assailed, but as in a mob trial, witnesses to a pattern of illegality are not angels. Congress and the voters are getting their first up-close look at the mound of evidence that could be Trump\u2019s undoing.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais\/AP) Seven pharmaceutical executives sat down in a row before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday morning. Three hours later, they emerged from the hearing room relatively unscathed. In the hearing on drug prices \u2014 billed as one of the biggest Congress-vs.-industry showdowns since the tobacco hearings of the 1990s \u2014 exchanges between the lawmakers and the CEOs were remarkably unremarkable. Finance Committee\u00a0Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking Democrat\u00a0Ron Wyden (Ore.) tried to kick the hearing off energetically, both warning the executives they shouldn\u2019t try to redirect blame to other parts of the health-care industry for skyrocketing drug prices in the United States. \u201cLike most Americans, I\u2019m sick and tired of the blame game,\u201d Grassley told the panel. Wyden recounted the tobacco hearings. \u201cI was there when seven Big Tobacco CEOs testified in a committee room like this one, and they lied,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chairman and I expect better this morning.\u201d But while senators on the committee asked the executives a range of questions about the drug pipeline, there were few true \u201cgotcha\u201d moments. The witnesses frequently recited well-worn arguments for why insurers and pharmacy middlemen (called pharmacy benefit managers, or\u00a0PBMs) should share more of the blame for the high cos of prescription drugs. The senators largely refrained from insisting on direct answers as to why these companies have massively inflated\u00a0prices for specific medications. Here are your Health 202 takeaways form the hearing: 1. Drugmakers were reluctant to make firm commitments to lowering list prices even under their best-case scenario. Grassley pointed to a recent proposal from the Trump administration to ban the rebates drugmakers give to pharmacy benefit managers\u00a0\u2014 an idea enthusiastically backed by the drug industry and decried by PBMs. Grassley asked the executives whether they would agree to lower their own list prices if they were freed of paying rebates. \u201cShould the administration finalize this rule, will you commit to lowering your drug prices?\u201d Grassley asked. The executives expressed openness to the idea but stressed\u00a0the rebate ban should apply broadly to drugs covered in commercial plans and not just government-run programs \u2014 and hinted that insurers should still feel a responsibility to charge smaller co-payments to customers. \u201cIf the rebates were removed from the commercial sector as well, we would definitely reduce our list prices,\u201d AstraZeneca\u2019s Pascal Soriot said. Sanofi's Olivier Brandicourt responded: \u201cLowering list price has to be linked to better access and affordability at the counter for the patients.\u201d David Mitchell, president and founder of Patients for Affordable Drugs:\u00a0 2. Executives\u00a0did plenty\u00a0of blame-shifting. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Jennifer Taubert repeated several times that insurers and PBMs excel at extracting lower prices from drugmakers, insinuating they cut into the industry\u2019s profits without necessarily passing those savings along to consumers. \u201cWe strongly advocate for rebate reforms that would allow us to lower our list prices,\u201d Taubert said. Merck\u2019s Kenneth Frazier urged the senators to \u201crecognize the system itself is complex and it\u2019s interdependent.\u201d \u201cNo one company can unilaterally lower list prices without running into disadvantages that make it hard to do that,\u201d Frazier said. Said Soriot: \u201cIt\u2019s one of those situations where no one can fix it by themselves.\" Wyden accused drugmakers of \u201cstonewalling\u201d on the key issue of list prices. \u201cReducing those list prices are the easiest ways for American consumers to pay less at the pharmacy counter,\u201d he said. 3. Drugmakers\u00a0expressed opposition to any type of government price-setting. Several senators brought up the idea of an international drug price index suggested by the Trump administration for lowering what Medicare pays for prescription drugs distributed by doctors. The executives hit back against that idea, as well as a more far-reaching proposal to allow the government to directly negotiate lower prices in Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be good policy,\u201d Brandicourt said, in response to a line of questioning from Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.). He added that government \u201cprice controls\u201d wouldn\u2019t be sufficient to make medications affordable for consumers. Kaiser Family Foundation senior vice president Larry Levitt: 4. They all said they support the CREATES Act. All the executives claimed their companies don\u2019t try to block generic developers by withholding samples of their medications \u2014 an industry practice that would be ended by the bipartisan CREATES Act. The measure, which we\u2019ve written about here, is a top candidate for drug pricing legislation that Congress could pass this year. Yet,\u00a0as Stat News noted, a database run by the Food and Drug Administration shows Pfizer and AstraZeneca have been accused of this very practice. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.):\u00a0 5. Humira was the redheaded stepchild of the day. The skyrocketing costs of insulin came up several times, but it was really Humira, AbbVie\u2019s arthritis drug, that lawmakers chose to pummel. Humira, which is on track to the be the most profitable medication in history, now costs about $38,000 for a year\u2019s worth of treatment. Wyden, along with Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and John Cornyn (R-Tex.), focused on Humira as a prime example of how companies price gouge consumers, noting that AbbVie has dozens of patents on the drug to protect the company\u2019s exclusive right to produce it. Cornyn said he supports the patent system\u00a0because it incentivizes companies to invest in research and development of new drugs,\u00a0but he suggested AbbVie is gaming the system to protect its monopoly on Humira much longer than should be allowed. Stabenow pressured AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez to admit the medicine\u2019s chemical makeup hasn\u2019t changed despite the company\u2019s multiple patents. And Wyden said the company \u201cprotects the exclusivity of Humira like Gollum with his ring.\u201d \u201cThick cobwebs of patents, legal tricks and shadowy deals with other drugmakers, all to keep the cash flowing,\u201d Wyden said. Senators highlighted some other hearing moments: Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.):\u00a0 The Hill reporter Peter Sullivan: The Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing: Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\u00a0(Salwan Georges\/The Washington Post) AHH: Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) is expected to unveil a much-anticipated new Medicare-for-all\u00a0plan later today that goes even further than what Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) proposed in 2017, our Post colleague Jeff Stein reports in this sneak peek at the bill. Here are some highlights from the plan, which has more than 100 House Democratic co-sponsors, and how it differs from Sanders's Senate bill. (Jeff also reports\u00a0Sanders is currently working on an update to his bill.) Jayapal's bill does not specify how it would pay for the new legislation.\u00a0 \u201cWe have a plan. We have a real plan,\u201d Jayapal told reporters. \u201cAmericans are literally dying because they cannot afford insulin and can\u2019t get the cancer treatments they need . . . I think this Medicare-for-all bill makes it clear what we mean by health care for all.

Today From the Fact Checker:\u00a0Did Ivanka Trump create 'millions' of jobs?:","74":"On Thursday, President Trump once again criticized the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, blaming the central bank for the U.S. economy\u2019s slowing growth. That\u2019s an echo of his March 2 complaint at a Conservative Political Action Conference, and of quite a few such critiques during 2018, when the president called out the Fed for steadily raising interest rates. And in late 2018, rumors circulated that Trump had been asking whether he could dismiss Powell as chairman after controversially declining to renominate previous chair Janet L. Yellen only a year earlier. Those rumors led Powell to declare on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he has every intention of serving his four-year term. While Trump\u2019s open criticism is unusual in its tone and volume, presidential dismay about Fed policy is not. William McChesney Martin, who led the Fed from 1951 to 1970 and was its longest-serving chairman, once called the Fed\u2019s job to \u201ctake away the punch bowl just as the party gets going.\u201d Central banks often hike Interest rates to prevent inflation, distressing politicians who would rather keep rates low, help fuel economic activity, and thereby improve their reelection chances. But our research shows that the more strongly insulated a country\u2019s central bank is from political interference, the less a country has to pay to finance its national debts. Two recent illustrations Over the summer and early fall of 2018, investors became weary of the monetary policy in Turkey and Argentina. In both countries, inflation was rising and investors were concerned about their respective central banks\u2019 independence. In Turkey, the president shortened the term in office of the central bank governor and deprived the central bank governor of any say in selecting deputy governors. In Argentina, two central bank governors resigned in 2018, signaling policy disagreements with the government. Quickly investors began selling both the Turkish lira and the Argentine peso. During 2018 both currencies lost about half their value against the dollar, and both countries had to pay significantly higher interest rates to entice investors to purchase their debt. The United States benefits from a unique position in the global financial system that affords it cheap access to capital. Yet there may be consequences even for the United States from a public brawl between the president and the Fed. So do the anecdotes illustrate anything larger? Are there measurable costs to meddling with the independence of a country\u2019s central bank or firing its head? How we did our research We evaluated the economic costs of political interference by asking whether the governance of a country\u2019s central bank influences the nation\u2019s credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s. Credit ratings are important because they affect whether a nation can access capital markets and how much such loans will cost. The higher a country\u2019s credit rating, the stronger the rating agencies\u2019 confidence that the country will be able and willing to repay its debt when it comes due; more confidence generally means a likelihood of a loan at lower rates. Our empirical analysis uses data from 1973 to 2010 from 78 developed and developing countries. For each country, we measure its credit rating issued by either Moody\u2019s or Standard & Poor\u2019s. We convert the original ratings (AAA, AA, A or Aaa, Aa1, Aa3) into 17-point numeric scales. We measure central bank governance in two distinct ways. First, we use an index that codes countries\u2019 laws to capture the legal autonomy of central banks to make monetary policy decisions independent from the political needs of governments. This is a well-accepted index that we updated in previously published work. A central bank has more legal independence when the governor\u2019s term in office is longer; the appointment and dismissal procedures are insulated from the government; the bank\u2019s mandate is focused on price stability and the terms on central bank lending to the government are restrictive. Second, we aim to capture tensions in the relation between the central bank and the government, usually reflected by the dismissal or resignation of the central bank governor or chair. We measured the departure of the head of the central bank before the end of the legal term in office. Independent central banks improve a country\u2019s credit ratings \u2014 and government interference brings those ratings down.  We find strong evidence that greater legal central bank independence improves a country\u2019s credit ratings. For example, in January 2016, Standard & Poor\u2019s lowered its outlook for Poland\u2019s sovereign credit \u2014 specifically noting that the governing Law and Justice party was weakening democratic institutions\u2019 independence, including that of Poland\u2019s central bank. Standard & Poor\u2019s, however, raised its outlook in December 2016, when it judged that the governing party was no longer threatening the central bank. Generally, open conflict about central bank autonomy \u2014 as when a government dismisses or prompts the resignation of a central bank\u2019s governor \u2014 reduces a nation\u2019s credit ratings. For example, in December 2018, after India\u2019s central bank\u2019s governor resigned, Moody\u2019s warned India\u2019s government to protect the central bank\u2019s independence. Why does central bank governance matter? Why do credit rating agencies closely watch how central banks are governed? Good governance serves as a heuristic that reduces uncertainty about the prospects of countries. First, preserving legal central bank independence signals that the government is committed to general macroeconomic stability, including repaying its debt. Second, when the central bank and the government have disagreements major enough to cause resignations or dismissals, investors worry about increased uncertainty surrounding countries\u2019 future policies. Central bank independence tells investors they can expect stable inflation and a predictable monetary policy. Good governance has long-lasting effects. Dismissing or pushing out a central bank\u2019s head determine rating agencies to immediately downgrade the country\u2019s credit rating. And the negative effect of the central bank\u2019s head irregular replacement will continue to be reflected in a lower credit rating over many years. In the past four decades, more countries across the globe insulated their central banks from day-to-day politics. But some governments have headed in the other direction, including Hungary, Poland, Thailand, India and South Africa. Our research shows that government interference in monetary policy will be costly. No wonder Chairman Powell insists that the Fed does not take politics into account in making decisions about interest rates.

In somewhat of a surprise, however, one poll suggests that among the public, Democrats aren\u2019t all that keen on the idea, either. They seem to be increasingly in agreement with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who recently proclaimed impeachment to be too divisive. CNN reports: Support for impeaching President Donald Trump has fallen 7 points since December, a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS finds, following Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi calling impeachment \"so divisive to the country.\" The decline \u2014 from 43% in favor in December to 36% now \u2014 stems largely from a change in Democratic views on impeaching the President. In December, 80% of self-identified Democrats said they were in favor of impeachment \u2014 that now stands at 68%, a 12-point dip. Among independents and Republicans, support for impeachment has fallen 3 points over the same time. It\u2019s not that Democrats think Trump hasn\u2019t engaged in misconduct. They simply don\u2019t want to impeach him.  Overall, \"even though Americans are shying away from impeachment, only about 4 in 10 say Democrats in Congress are overreaching in the investigations of the President they have launched since taking control of the House in January. About a third (34%) say congressional Democrats are doing the right amount, and 22% feel they\u2019re doing too little.\u201d) Among Democrats, 94 percent think the House is doing the right amount or not enough investigation. And most Americans (56 percent) still think special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation is important and worthwhile, compared with 38 percent who think it\u2019s an effort to discredit Trump. It\u2019s not entirely clear why Democrats have soured on impeachment. One possibility is that they rather like the multifaceted investigation, understanding that it is already driving Trump nuts and revealing the extent of his mendacity. Another theory is that Democrats are now enjoying the start of the presidential primary, look forward to an election and want to run against a badly bruised Trump. Lastly, Democrats might have figured out that impeachment will not result in removal, but might help revive Trump and enliven his supporters. For those dismayed that the chances of impeachment are diminishing, let\u2019s remember some key facts. First, if Trump has committed crimes, he can be prosecuted after leaving office both for alleged obstruction in relation to the Russia probe and in New York for everything from alleged conspiracy, violation of campaign finance laws, financial crimes and witness tampering\/obstruction (e.g. if he dangled a pardon for Michael Cohen in an effort to keep him quiet.). Beating Trump in November 2020 means the country might finally see justice done. Second, Mueller is conducting a counterintelligence investigation and has already turned up evidence of the Trump Tower meeting to get dirt on Hillary Clinton, Paul Manafort\u2019s consorting with and providing loads of polling data to someone who may have ties to Russian intelligence, Konstantin Kilimnik. The conclusion could very well be that Trump\u2019s campaign was in fact colluding but he was too clueless to figure out what was going on and too gullible in hiring so many of Russia\u2019s flunkies. Finally, Trump\u2019s business might still be indicted, a move that would essentially allege that the Trump Organization is a criminal enterprise responsible for a whole bunch of crimes. Trump might not care all that much if an associate or even his son-in-law goes to jail, but losing the business his father gave him (and had to repeatedly bail out due to Trump\u2019s ineptitude) would be devastating to Trump, whose entire identity is based on the pretense that he\u2019s a genius negotiator and successful mogul. If it\u2019s all taken away, Trump would just be another cranky retiree yelling at Fox News for hours on end. Read more: Jennifer Rubin: Pelosi\u2019s right. Forget about impeachment.

At various points, Cohen was supposed to testify before three different congressional committees about his work for Trump \u2014 the Senate Intelligence Committee, the House Intelligence Committee and the House Oversight Committee. But in each instance, his scheduled appearance was canceled or postponed. Lanny J. Davis, one of Cohen\u2019s lawyers, cited a recent shoulder surgery as the reason Cohen would have to cancel the Senate panel appearance. \u201cThe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has accepted Mr. Cohen\u2019s request for postponement of tomorrow\u2019s hearing due to post-surgery medical needs,\u201d he said. \u201cA future date will be announced by the committee.\u201d Spokeswomen for the committee\u2019s leadership did not comment. Last week, the House Intelligence Committee cited \u201cthe investigation\u2019s interest\u201d in postponing its hearing, and Cohen\u2019s lawyer had blamed alleged \u201cthreats\u201d from Trump as the reason for canceling what would have been public testimony before the House Oversight Committee. Cohen pleaded guilty last year to various federal crimes, including lying to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow and arranging hush-money payments to buy the silence of women who alleged affairs with Trump several years ago. He was sentenced in December to three years in prison and is scheduled to report on March\u00a06. At Cohen\u2019s request, the judge who sentenced him has recommended the prison term be served at a federal facility in Otisville, N.Y. The Bureau of Prisons has not indicated publicly whether it will approve the request. Each postponement seems to make his testifying less likely, though some lawmakers have suggested that Cohen could be compelled to testify even after he is incarcerated. His House Intelligence Committee appearance is now scheduled for Feb.\u00a028. Cohen probably has a lot of information that would interest lawmakers; at his sentencing hearing, he talked of how it was once his job to cover up Trump\u2019s \u201cdirty deeds.\u201d While much of what he has to say already has been aired in court \u2014 federal prosecutors have alleged, for example, that it was at Trump\u2019s direction that Cohen arranged the hush-money payments, in violation of campaign finance laws \u2014 there are many questions he has not answered. He could describe, for example, what role, if any, Trump played in shaping his false congressional testimony, and offer other behind-the-scenes details of his interactions with Trump about the hush money.","77":"Good morning & welcome back!

President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman has been sentenced to only 47 months in prison for multiple financial crimes, far less than sentencing guidelines recommended. Lawmakers and public defenders immediately pointed out that this revealed hideous racial and wealth-based disparities in sentencing. Writing at the Atlantic, Franklin Foer detailed Manafort\u2019s decades of work on behalf of tax-dodging multinational corporations and murderous authoritarians, his dalliances with international oligarchs and his own \u201cindustrial scale\u201d tax evasion via offshore accounts. As Foer notes, all throughout, \"he acted with impunity, as if the laws never applied to him.\u201d Manafort is going to prison, but his light sentence might not do much to disabuse him of that notion. In this sense, Manafort stands as a reminder that the Trump presidency, in so many ways, reflects a much larger crisis of elite corruption and impunity. After all, we are now in the midst of discovering whether Trump can indulge in industrial-scale wrongdoing, misconduct, corrupt self-dealing, and likely criminality with impunity, as if rules and laws don\u2019t apply to him. The Democrats\u2019 bill, which just passed the House on a party-line vote, offers the foundation for the Democratic answer to this. A blend of corruption and plutocracy Trump came to office by promising to drain the swamp of elite corruption and take on the plutocrats who rig our political economy to enrich themselves. Those promises were immediately tossed aside, and we are now consumed in a debate over whether our system has an answer to what the real Trumpism has turned out to be \u2014 a particularly toxic blend of corruption and plutocracy. We have learned from Trump\u2019s longtime former lawyer Michael Cohen that his tax returns may contain the clues to extensive financial fraud, including gaming assets for insurance and tax avoidance purposes. Cohen also told us that Trump\u2019s tax returns might illuminate how extensive tax fraud vastly inflated the size of Trump\u2019s inherited fortune. Trump\u2019s ascension to the presidency itself rests to no small degree on that foundation of fraud, since that inherited fortune helped bolster Trump\u2019s self-made businessman mystique despite being vastly inflated through nefarious means, which he concealed by refusing to release those returns. Trump\u2019s tax returns might also shed light on his corruption in office \u2014 on his extensive self-dealing in potential violation of the Constitution, and on how he personally profited off of the massive corporate tax cut he signed. That tax cut was an enormous giveaway to America\u2019s corporate elites. And as Brian Beutler has detailed, the plutocrats who reaped the gains helped Trump sell the plan by actively helping to create the illusion that it was pro-worker, demonstrating the seamy overlap between their bottom lines and his self-dealing. There is no legal requirement that a presidential candidate release his tax returns. Major candidates have done so for decades because they recognize an obligation to the public. Trump wiped his shoes on this obligation, and thus has exploited the lack of any such requirement to get elected and then to enrich himself with his office. Thus, as Will Wilkinson writes, Trump\u2019s presidency represents \u201cthe apotheosis of the crooked class.\" He not only relied on a tax system that facilitates gaming and the evasion of accountability to create the mystique that got him elected; once in office, Wilkinson points out, Trump furthered this on behalf of that class: \u201cThe IRS has been starved of resources, audits of big corporations and the wealthy are down, and big banks and corporations have been given more leeway to rip people off with impunity.\u201d The Democratic anti-corruption bill The bill that Democrats voted on today would drain that swamp. It would require major presidential candidates to release 10 years of tax returns and require that presidents and vice presidents divest to avoid financial conflicts of interest. It would bolster transparency on campaign spending and fortify ethics rules constraining lobbyists in all kinds of ways. It would thwart voter suppression and extreme gerrymanders while making participation easier. Political scientist Lee Drutman has described the bill as \u201cthe most transformative pro-democracy package in decades.\u201d The GOP Senate will, of course, refuse any vote on the bill. But in so doing, as Jacob Levy says, Republicans will demonstrate that they don\u2019t believe their ideas can triumph without \u201celection-rigging.\u201d And they will leave behind Democrats as the sole party of real reform. And amid a great deal of talk about Democratic division, this is an agenda that actually commands a great deal of unity. There is disagreement among Democrats over how to break the outsize influence and power of the wealthy, with some favoring higher taxes than others and some leaning harder into structural economic reforms than others. But this bill shows massive consensus around a set of proposals that would counter elite corruption and influence. Last fall, more than 100 House Democratic candidates campaigned on a letter supporting such reforms \u2014 and they came from all types of districts. The group End Citizens United closely tracks what the 2020 Democratic hopefuls support on campaign finance issues, and they note that all the top tier candidates have gravitated toward a much more robust reform agenda by unifying against taking corporate PAC and lobbyist money. This broad reform agenda helped elect a Democratic House in 2018. And it will likely be central to the agenda that Democrats rally around in 2020, as part of a vow to carry out the unrigging and swamp-draining that Trump promised \u2014 and reneged upon.","79":"NYON, Switzerland \u2014 Paris Saint-Germain won an initial legal battle with UEFA on Tuesday over the monitoring of its spending on player transfers and wages, and sponsorship deals linked to the club\u2019s Qatari owner. The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld PSG\u2019s appeal against an attempt by UEFA investigators to reopen a previously closed investigation. The judgment in favor of PSG is separate from another UEFA investigation of its finances in the 2017-18 season when the French champions, backed by Qatari sovereign wealth, signed Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. The most severe punishment in that ongoing probe could see UEFA ban PSG from the Champions League. World soccer\u2019s most coveted club competition is key to building the club\u2019s global appeal and paid the French club 62 million euros ($70 million) last season in prize money alone. The appeal judgment Tuesday from CAS related to UEFA\u2019s club finance monitoring panel wanting to review its own decision that declared PSG\u2019s accounts through June 2017 compliant with \u201cFinancial Fair Play\u201d rules. The court said UEFA\u2019s panel of independent investigators and judges missed the deadline to challenge their own previous decision. \u201cThe challenged decision was untimely and must be annulled,\u201d CAS said in a statement, announcing the ruling while PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi attended talks at UEFA headquarters about future changes to the Champions League. Al Khelaifi, who is also a member of UEFA\u2019s executive committee representing European clubs, declined to comment to The Associated Press. PSG\u2019s victory was expected after Turkish club Galatasaray won a similar CAS ruling against UEFA last month. \u201cThe CAS decision does not put in doubt the objectives of the UEFA Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play system,\u201d UEFA said, repeating its statement issued in the Galatasaray case. UEFA said its lawyers will analyze the CAS judgment and make \u201cany clarifications or amendments to its rules\u201d required. PSG has long been a major target of UEFA\u2019s FFP project since the launch in 2011. It requires clubs to approach break-even business on soccer, such as on player transfers and wages, and also assesses the fair market value of sponsorship deals. \u201cThe club emphasizes it has always respected the rules and always striven to reply calmly and transparently to repeated requests from UEFA and its club finance panel,\u201d PSG said in a statement Tuesday. Critics say FFP protects storied clubs from being challenged by ambitious rivals with wealthy owners, though UEFA insists it aims to control club debts and over-inflation of the soccer market. Since being bought by its Qatari owners in 2011, PSG has been suspected of using overvalued sponsor deals from the gas-rich emirate to balance its accounts and comply with UEFA rules. The club forfeited 20 million euros ($22.8 million) of Champions League prize money in a 2014 settlement that avoided a more high-stakes legal fight. Manchester City, which is owned by Abu Dhabi\u2019s ruling family, got the same deal from UEFA. In April 2017, UEFA released PSG and Man City from their settlement agreements for complying with three years of stricter monitoring. PSG then spent heavily in that offseason, breaking soccer\u2019s transfer record to buy Neymar from Barcelona for 222 million euros (about $250 million). A loan deal was agreed with Monaco for Mbappe that became a 180 million euro ($205 million) purchase last year. UEFA opened an investigation soon after the loan for Mbappe was completed in August 2017. ___","80":"His tractor is so noisy that, when driving it, the man who calls himself \u201cjust a farmer from Butler County\u201d puts his cellphone under his cap, set on vibrate. Charles E. Grassley, 85, who has served in the Senate longer than all but 11 of the 1,983 other senators \u2014 and who still runs three miles four mornings a week \u2014 does not have ample time for farming because he has visited all of Iowa\u2019s 99\u00a0counties every year for 38 years and last missed a Senate vote 8,300 votes ago, when Iowa was flooded in 1993. He is a non-lawyer who just left the chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee to become chairman of the Finance Committee. In his 45th year in Congress (he was in the House from 1975 to 1981), he will help this institution recover some of the power it has improvidently \u2014 and perhaps unconstitutionally \u2014 delegated to presidents. His committee\u2019s purview is vast \u2014 he intends to address prescription drug prices \u2014 but trade policy will be at the top of the committee\u2019s agenda. There is the revised agreement with Mexico and Canada to approve, and a developing agreement with Japan to partially undo the damage done by the president\u2019s scrapping of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Recently a representative of the European Union was in Grassley\u2019s office explaining why agriculture could not be included in a trade agreement. Grassley affably but unbendingly explained to her that there would be no agreement without agriculture. To dispel any fact-free superstitions about GMOs (genetically modified organisms), Grassley took from a small bag a genetically modified soybean and, to demonstrate its safety, chewed it as farmers do to test whether a bean\u2019s moisture indicates the crop is ready for harvest. Grassley, who is the right finance chairman for a Senate interested in clawing back powers, says: \u201cThe Constitution tasks Congress with the authority to regulate trade with foreign countries.\u201d And: \u201cI do not believe that we should alienate our allies with tariffs disguised as national security protections.\u201d President Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from, among other places, placid, tranquil Canada, a military ally, because, he says, they threaten \u201cnational security.\u201d This is absurd, and he might soon pioneer a new dimension of preposterousness by saying automobile imports do, too. Perhaps some contemporary Longfellow will celebrate the president as a Paul Revere, spreading the alarm to every village and farm: \u201cThe Audis are coming! The Audis are coming!\u201d Presidents can unilaterally impose taxes, which tariffs are, because 56\u00a0years ago, during the Cold War (11\u00a0days before President John F.\u00a0Kennedy told the nation about the Cuban missile crisis), the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 became law. Its Section\u00a0232 empowers the president, upon a finding from the secretary of commerce (the president\u2019s employee) that this or that import jeopardizes \u201cnational security,\u201d to impose tariffs. The president\u2019s decision is almost completely immune to review. Legislation sponsored by Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Doug Jones (D-Ala.) would require the Defense Department, not Commerce, to argue any national security rationale for Section 232 tariffs and would empower Congress to disapprove Section 232 actions concerning tariffs on any products. Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) proposes even better legislation that would require Congress to approve   a presidential act under Section 232. Because 41 senators could filibuster a resolution of approval, that number could block Section 232 tariffs. And Toomey\u2019s bill is retroactive to require congressional approval of Trump\u2019s metals tariffs. Grassley, who thinks Congress has delegated too much power over trade, probably will be decisive regarding measures to narrow the scope of presidential discretion, thereby reclaiming some of Congress\u2019s powers. Having served in Congress during eight presidencies, Grassley knows they come and go, while Congress endures, although it has not always been conscientious regarding its responsibilities. The arguments for term limits on members of Congress are convincing, but Grassley, who in seven terms has developed a stronger attachment to the prerogatives of his institution than to any president, illustrates a benefit of long careers. When Daniel Patrick Moynihan \u2014 a New York chauvinist, and properly so \u2014 came to the Senate in 1977, he sought, and got, a seat on the Finance Committee. He considered it scandalous that no senator from the capital of American finance had been on the panel in 50 years. But Moynihan would be content that the committee is now chaired by the man on the tractor. Read more from George F. Will\u2019s archive or follow him on Facebook. Read more: Robert D.

(Jim Weber\/Commercial Appeal\/AP) With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro THE BIG IDEA: President Trump thought the electoral college was \u201ca disaster for democracy\u201d \u2014 until he received 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton in 2016 but won the White House anyway.  After Barack Obama secured a second term in 2012, Trump tweeted: Four Novembers later, after winning the electoral college 306 to 232, he changed his tune: In tweets posted after 10 p.m. Tuesday, Trump expounded on the virtues of the system. \u201cCampaigning for the Popular Vote is much easier & different than campaigning for the Electoral College,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s like training for the 100 yard dash vs. a marathon. The brilliance of the Electoral College is that you must go to many States to win. With the Popular Vote, you go to just the large States \u2014 the Cities would end up running the Country. Smaller States & the entire Midwest would end up losing all power \u2014 & we can\u2019t let that happen. I used to like the idea of the Popular Vote, but now realize the Electoral College is far better for the U.S.A.\u201d -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) put this issue on the front-burner when she announced during a televised town hall on CNN Monday night that she wants to replace the system we\u2019ve used to elect presidents since 1789. Her answer was clearly rehearsed, and she used a question about voting rights for the formerly incarcerated to call for the abolition of the electoral college. She\u2019s made it a central theme of a three-day swing through the South. \u201cWe get to a general election for the highest office in this land, and no presidential candidate comes to Alabama or to Mississippi,\u201d Warren told a crowd of 500 at a rally last night in Birmingham, Ala. \u201cYour vote just doesn\u2019t count ... and that is wrong.\u201d Strikingly, Warren\u2019s proposal to end the electoral college is now one of her biggest applause lines. The crowds love it. Democrats, after all, have now won the national popular vote but lost the presidency four times now: in 2016 and 2000, as well as 1888 and 1876. (To be fair, it was a very, very, very different party in the 19th century.) -- Polling shows why it\u2019s a sensible position to stake out in a Democratic primary. A Pew Research Center poll last year found a 55 percent majority support picking presidents by popular vote, compared to 41 percent who prefer keeping the electoral college. A solid 75 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents support amending the Constitution so the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide wins, compared with 32 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. A majority of Republicans prefer the electoral college regardless of whether they live in a red state, a blue state or a battleground. And a majority of Democrats prefer the popular vote regardless of where they live, as well. Our in-house polling analyst Emily Guskin synthesized the results in an email: \u201cPartisans are likely to prefer ways they think their parties could win!\u201d Other polls have found slightly different results, seemingly based on how the questions are worded: -- The result is that the electoral college has emerged as this week\u2019s new litmus test for the crowded field:  -- The Constitution has changed over time in important ways, of course. Warren, for example, came out for ending the electoral college while speaking to a primarily black audience at a historically black university in Jackson, Miss. Black Americans were counted as three-fifths of a person until the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868. Speaking of Warren, the founders also didn\u2019t imagine women voting \u2014 let alone running for president. The 19th Amendment didn\u2019t guarantee suffrage until 1920. -- But, but, but: There\u2019s something discordant about this moment. It\u2019s peculiar to watch Democratic candidates warn in apocalyptic terms that Trump is disregarding sacred norms and thereby destroying the republic in one breath while calling for radical steps like packing the Supreme Court, changing the way we pick presidents, ending private health insurance or paying out reparations in the next. -- The president is functioning again as his own acting White House communications director since former Fox News executive Bill Shine abruptly resigned on March 8. He appears to have identified the electoral college as an opportunity to bolster a broader narrative. In a tweet just after midnight, Trump linked calls for abolishing the electoral college to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s endorsement last week of lowering the voting age to 16, along with Democratic calls to enlarge the Supreme Court to 15 justices. He said Democrats are \u201cgetting very \u2018strange.\u2019\u201d -- This is a message that conservative elites are thrilled to echo. They\u2019d much rather tout the virtues of the electoral college than answer for Trump\u2019s continuing insults toward the late John McCain, the military construction projects that won\u2019t get funded because of the president\u2019s \u201cnational emergency,\u201d the White House\u2019s refusal to comply with legitimate document requests from congressional investigators and the Senate GOP\u2019s blockade of a resolution calling for the release of Bob Mueller\u2019s report. -- The GOP\u2019s relentless message discipline in characterizing Democrats as moving outside the mainstream has begun to pay tangible dividends. Attacking liberals for espousing ideas like reparations and the Green New Deal, often with over-the-top hyperbole, is activating Republican voters who were deeply ambivalent just a few month ago, despite whatever unease they may feel about Trump himself. A CNN poll published last night included a red flag for Democrats in this area. Overall, enthusiasm about voting in the next election is higher than it\u2019s been at any time since the start of the century. Four in 10 Americans said they are \u201cextremely enthusiastic\u201d about casting a ballot for president. \u201cBut unlike last year's midterm elections, when Democratic enthusiasm propelled the party to a majority in the House of Representatives, the energy now is higher among Republicans,\u201d according to CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta. \u201cNearly 6 in 10 self-identified Republicans (57%) say they are extremely enthusiastic about voting for president, compared with 46% among Democrats and 26% among independents.\u201d -- Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law and a senior adviser on his reelection campaign, claimed on Fox News last night that Democrats are trying to get rid of the electoral college because they\u2019ve concluded that it will be \u201calmost impossible\u201d to win in 2020 otherwise. \u201cThey want to find any way they can to beat Donald Trump because I think they know it\u2019s going to be incredibly hard, almost impossible, to beat this president in the 2020 election,\u201d Lara Trump said. \u201cI think you\u2019re seeing \u2026 panic mode now on the Democratic side.\u201d -- To be sure, getting rid of the electoral college is not a new idea. It\u2019s been discussed to varying degrees for nearly two centuries, and many prominent Democrats endorsed it after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bush v. Gore. There\u2019s also no way a constitutional amendment to abolish it would pass before the 2020 election. Last night in Alabama, Warren acknowledged the difficulty of passing a constitutional amendment. She said maybe it will happen \u201csomeday,\u201d but for now she supports the state-level efforts. This past Friday, Colorado became the 12th state to join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. These states have agreed to deliver their electoral votes to whomever wins the national popular vote \u2014 even if that candidate loses their state. It will only take effect if states with a combined 270 electoral votes agree to participate. Colorado\u2019s nine electoral votes put the collective total at 181. Clinton carried all dozen of the states that have signed on. Legislation is moving right now in New Mexico and Delaware. But getting past 270 will prove very difficult. -- For Warren and Democrats, it comes down to a question of fairness. \u201cTrump\u2019s presidency is, in one sense, a function of random geographic lines,\u201d Philip Bump observes. \u201cBlue states that voted for Clinton tend to be home to large cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Clinton ran up the vote in Los Angeles \u2014 but it did no good, since California was always safe for her, anyway. In 2016, Democrats had more than 11 million wasted votes, votes above the margin needed in each state to carry it for Clinton. Republicans wasted about 8 million. Move 78,000 of those votes \u2014 0.7 percent of them \u2014 to Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, and Clinton is the president.\u201d Put another way, \u201cClinton ended up getting more votes overall than Obama did four years earlier. The problem was that those increases were often in states where she was already likely to win. In states that Clinton won by more than 20 percentage points, she got an average of 6,500 more votes per county than Obama did in 2012, while Trump improved on Mitt Romney by 679. In states that she carried by 10 points or less, Trump did better than Romney by 163 votes on average in every county \u2014 but she did worse than Obama by more than 650. \u2026 As Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has pointed out, Republicans have won the popular vote only once in her lifetime [2004] but have held the White House for 10 years.\u201d Former vice president Joe Biden is reportedly already looking for donors to support his 2020 campaign. (Saul Loeb\/AFP\/Getty)\u00a0 MORE ON 2020: -- Many lesser-known Democratic candidates are trying different ways to get 65,000 individual donors, the magic number needed to secure a spot on stage for the debates. Michael Scherer reports:\u00a0\u201cThe latest turn \u2026 looks a bit like an infomercial for a food dehydrator or Ginsu knives. Former congressman John Delaney stands in front of a whiteboard in an online video, pitching voters on a new way to double their money. \u2018It\u2019s really simple, and it\u2019s actually a pretty good deal,\u2019 the Maryland Democrat says. \u2018You give one, I give two to a charity of your choice.\u2019 You heard that right, folks. A candidate for president wants your donation so badly that he is willing to pay twice as much out of pocket. Buttigieg reached his 65,000 goal last week after a successful CNN town hall. ... Businessman Andrew Yang put a counter on his homepage to drive the online energy past 65,000 donors. \u2026 Aides to Marianne Williamson, a self-help guru, and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro say their campaigns are also on track to qualify. Using polling alone to filter the field, especially this early in the process, would almost certainly have meant a far smaller group of candidates onstage. Recent national polls have shown no more than a dozen candidates with 1 percent support, the criteria used to qualify for the first Democratic debate in 2015.\u201d -- Joe Biden has told at least half a dozen supporters that he will run for president and asked for their help lining up major donors so he can raise $7 million quickly, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Emily Glazer and Ken Thomas report: \u201cBiden has expressed concern to these people that he wouldn\u2019t be able to raise millions of dollars in online donations immediately the way some other Democratic candidates have.\"\u00a0World leaders have encouraged Biden to run, adds\u00a0Politico\u2019s Daniel Lippman. -- A longtime top aide to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who was accused of mishandling a sexual harassment investigation, is leaving her office. Deputy chief of staff Anne Bradley was expected to retire later this year but pushed up her departure amid reports that a young female staffer quit Gillibrand\u2019s office in protest of the investigation that Bradley helped lead. The woman had accused Gillibrand\u2019s longtime driver, Abbas Malik, of sexual harassment, but Malik was not fired until after the recent reports on the matter started surfacing. (Politico) -- Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are talking a lot about civil rights, but not many black voters are listening. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports from South Carolina and Annie Linskey reports from Alabama: \u201cThey share a liberal philosophy focused on helping those who\u2019ve been hurt by the prevailing system, a message both say should resonate in black households. But both are older white candidates hailing from New England, and they often confront skepticism \u2014 if not ambivalence or indifference \u2014 from black voters, who have been notably absent from their campaign events. \u2026 A month before Sanders spoke at Royal Missionary Baptist Church, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) held a rally in the same room. Her crowd was much more racially varied, including a group of black women who showed up in church hats. The crowds showing up for Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) also have included far more voters of color.\u201d -- Bernie hired David Sirota, one of his most notoriously aggressive online supporters to be a senior adviser and speechwriter. Since December, Sirota had been writing criticisms of Sanders\u2019s Democratic opponents on Twitter and in columns published in the Guardian without disclosing that he unofficially worked for the senator,\u00a0the Atlantic\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere reports: \u201cSirota\u2019s hiring as a senior adviser and speechwriter was announced by the Sanders campaign on Tuesday morning after The Atlantic contacted the campaign and inquired about the undisclosed role Sirota held while attacking other Democrats.\u201d Before the announcement, he deleted critical thousands of problematic tweets. -- A new CNN-SSRS poll showed Harris has jumped in their poll by eight\u00a0points since December. CNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta reports: \u201cBiden (28%) and Sanders (20%) continue to hold the top slots in the large Democratic field. Harris now stands at 12% support ... up from 4% in December, and [O'Rourke] stands at 11%.\" --Harris's political identity was shaped as an undergrad at Howard University, a historically black school. The Los Angeles Times\u2019s Evan Halper reports:\u00a0\u201cThe campus during her time was a cauldron of activism and black pride at a moment in history, like now, when most black Americans were feeling alienated and unrepresented by the White House. \u2026 Harris was known on campus, but she was not among the most prominent student leaders. \u2026 She was undeniably in the mix, however, when busloads of students went regularly to the South African embassy and the National Mall for protests demanding an end to apartheid.\u201d WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Prime Minister Theresa May conceded that she now must ask E.U. leaders to delay Brexit for three months \u2014 because the Parliament has failed to pass her unloved deal for departure. William Booth and Michael Birnbaum report: \u201cStanding in Parliament on Wednesday, May blamed lawmakers for the impasse, acknowledging that the House of Commons has twice rejected the withdrawal agreement that May spent two years negotiating with her European counterparts. May said she would seek a short extension, just three months until June 30. If the delay were longer, Britain as a member of the European Union would have to participate in elections for the European parliament.

The deal would dwarf the previous record set just weeks ago when free agent Bryce Harper signed with the Philadelphia Phillies for $330 million over 13 years. (Dave Sheinin) The University of Southern California was the most frequently targeted school in the admissions scheme.\u00a0Six of the 50 alleged perpetrators\u00a0are current or former employees of the university, which has been at the center of multiple controversies in the last two years. (Moriah Balingit, Susan Svrluga and Nick Anderson)\u00a0\u00a0 A woman used a T-shirt cannon to launch contraband over a prison fence. The package, which was immediately noticed by prison staff in Sayre, Okla., contained tobacco, marijuana, cellphones and chargers, among other items. (Michael Brice-Saddler) MODERN POLITICAL MARRIAGES: -- Trump slammed George Conway as a \u201ctotal loser,\u201d ratcheting up a war of words that appears to have put serious strain on the marriage between the conservative power lawyer and his wife, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway. Josh Dawsey and John Wagner report on the family tension that keeps spilling into public view: -- The back-and-forth between the president and his aide's spouse continued on Twitter this morning: -- Ben Terris wrote a fantastic feature from El Paso on Beto O\u2019Rourke's marriage to Amy Hoover Sanders:\u00a0\u201cIn truth, even though Amy is fully on board, this isn\u2019t the life she would have chosen. ... The first time Beto suggested to Amy that he\u2019d like to run for Congress, she cried. She didn\u2019t want him to become some kind of D.C. jerk. The morning after the most recent election, the one he lost to Sen. Ted Cruz (R), she cried. ...\u00a0Whatever post-defeat sadness Amy felt, she was able to kick quickly; she\u2019s always been the stable one. Beto, on the other hand, more prone to higher highs and lower lows, was in a \u2018funk.\u2019\u00a0In January, Beto hit the road \u2026 and drew energy from the people he met, and ... by eating New Mexican dirt said to have regenerative powers. (He brought some home for the family to eat, too.) ... \u201cHe proposed on April Fools\u2019 Day, four months after they\u2019d first met. It seemed appropriate. That\u2019s how Amy knew him then and even now \u2014 impulsive and puckish. \u2026 And then there were the pranks: the remote-controlled cockroach in the kitchen, the \u2018Psycho\u2019-style scares in the shower. One time, according to a friend, Beto collected an especially verdant turd from one of their kids\u2019 diapers and put it in a bowl, telling Amy it was avocado.\u201d Amy\u00a0is a moderate and\u00a0has served as a moderating influence on Beto\u2019s politics and life:\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s quick to remind him how his casual profanity might rankle Texas conservatives, not least his in-laws. She\u2019s the one who tells him to stop doing push-ups before bed because it\u2019s keeping him awake at night. ... When Beto publicly suggested tearing down El Paso\u2019s border wall, for example, she was the first to suggest he rein in the rhetoric.\u201d Beto\u2019s parents met while his mother was on a date with Amy\u2019s dad. \u201cIt was 1970 when Bill Sanders picked up Melissa Martha Williams in his Porsche and sped 45 minutes from El Paso to Radium Springs, N.M., for a double date with one of his friends. Melissa can\u2019t remember the second woman who joined them, but she remembers Bill\u2019s friend clearly \u2014 his handsome face, large forehead and even larger personality; how he, too, drove a Porsche. His name was Patrick O\u2019Rourke, and less than a year after that first meeting, Melissa would marry him, and the two would be on their way to having their first child, Robert Francis.\u201d -- Related: Beto defeated a sitting congressman, Silvestre Reyes, in a 2012 Democratic primary by attacking him from the right. CNN\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski and Paul LeBlanc review the campaign: \u201cO'Rourke at the time endorsed cuts to defense and domestic spending in the middle and long term, along with seriously considering changes to Social Security and tax laws that would do away with some tax breaks. \u2026 O'Rourke attacked Reyes for his failure to vote for the Budget Reform Act of 2011, which created a super committee to develop a deficit reduction plan. \u2026 Reyes subsequently ran ads criticizing O'Rourke, saying he wanted to cut Social Security.\u201d -- The diversity of 2020 presidential candidates \u2014 from female lawmakers to a gay mayor and one bachelor senator dating an actress \u2014 could force a reconsideration of the \u201cfirst lady\u201d role, Karen Tumulty writes:\u00a0\u201cThe traditional title of first lady comes with no job description beyond the presumption that she should take on an unobjectionable cause or two and enthusiastically offer her unpaid services as event planner, decorator and catering manager. \u2026 The true running mates in 2020 will be a diverse cast. They are male and female, straight and gay. What we can hope is that, at the end of it all, they will have at last written a new script \u2014 which is no script at all \u2014 for the most difficult supporting role in politics.\u201d Special Counsel Robert Mueller departs after briefing senators on Capitol Hill. (Joshua Roberts\/Reuters) THERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Citing the \u201cpress of other work,\u201d special counsel Bob Mueller\u2019s team requested a delay in\u00a0responding to The Post\u2019s request to unseal documents in Paul Manafort\u2019s case. Spencer S. Hsu and Matt Zapotosky report: \u201cIn a two-page filing, Deputy Solicitor General Michael R. Dreeben and prosecutor Adam C. Jed wrote, \u2018Counsel responsible for preparing the response face the press of other work and require additional time to consult within the government.\u2019 A response had been due March 21. \u2026 The Post has objected to the abundance of sealed and redacted records in Manafort\u2019s Washington case and petitioned the judge in his case, Amy Berman Jackson, to open them to public view.\u201d -- Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is delaying his departure from the Justice Department. NBC News\u2019s Julia Ainsley and Pete Williams report: \u201cRosenstein had previously said he would leave in mid-March, noting during a public appearance on March 7 that it would be one of his final speeches. Rosenstein recently discussed his upcoming planned departure with Attorney General William Barr, after which it was decided that he would stay on a little longer, [a senior Justice] official said. \u2026 Asked whether the delay in Rosenstein's departure means that Mueller is still not ready to deliver his report, the official declined to comment.\u201d -- The White House has intentionally ignored\u00a0document requests from House Democrats as part of their investigations, breaking with the practice of past administrations of both parties and teeing up a constitutional showdown. Rachael Bade and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cThe White House has refused to share emails and correspondence in about a dozen document requests from the House Oversight and Reform Committee as well as three additional inquiries from the House Judiciary Committee, which has impeachment jurisdiction. The move is intentional as the White House sees the requests from newly empowered Democrats as illegitimate, too expansive or infringing on presidential privilege, such as Trump\u2019s communications with his senior advisers or another head of state, according to two senior administration officials. \u2026 Should the White House refuse to comply with subpoenas, Democrats could sue. But litigation could take years, delaying investigations of Trump indefinitely.\u201d -- \u201cThe White House hasn\u2019t turned over a single piece of paper to my committee,\u201d House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) writes in an op-ed today for today's paper: \u201cThe White House is engaged in an unprecedented level of stonewalling, delay and obstruction. I have sent 12 letters to the White House on a half-dozen topics \u2014 some routine and some relating to our core national security interests. In response, the White House has refused to hand over any documents or produce any witnesses for interviews.\u201d Cummings spotlights security clearances as one of several areas on which he cannot get answers: \u201cThe White House argues that Congress is not entitled to any information about individual employees, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying about his communications with the Russians; current national security adviser John Bolton, who worked directly with the gun rights group founded by now-convicted Russian spy Maria Butina; or the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was reportedly given access to our nation\u2019s most sensitive secrets over the objections of then-White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and others. Instead, the White House offered to let us read \u2014 but not keep \u2014 a few pages of policy documents that have nothing to do with the officials we are investigating, along with a general briefing on those policies during which they will answer no questions about specific employees.\u201d -- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said he is refocusing his panel\u2019s investigation on whether the president or any of his advisers have been under the influence of a foreign government, an act that would not necessarily trigger criminal charges from the special counsel's investigation. NBC News\u2019s Ken Dilanian reports: \u201cIn fact, most FBI counterintelligence investigations don't result in criminal charges, experts say, because they tend to involve secret intelligence that either can't be used in court or doesn't add up to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. If the FBI assesses that a government official is compromised by a foreign adversary, officials often will quietly remove that person from a sensitive role or wall him or her off from classified information. Obviously, none of that is an option for the president of the United States.\u201d -- House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) said Trump and his family are the \u201cgreatest threats to democracy\u201d he has seen in his lifetime.\u00a0The third-ranking Democrat in the House, who was responding to Trump\u2019s latest attacks on the late John McCain, went as far as comparing Trump to Adolf Hitler, saying \u201cwe had better be careful.\u201d (NBC) ARTICLE III: -- The Trump administration\u2019s agenda has suffered an unusually high number of defeats at the hands of federal judges, largely due to officials\u2019 amateurish handling of cases. Fred Barbash and Deanna Paul report: \u201cFederal judges have ruled against the Trump administration at least 63 times over the past two years \u2026 In case after case, judges have rebuked Trump officials for failing to follow the most basic rules of governance for shifting policy, including providing legitimate explanations supported by facts and, where required, public input. \u2026 [T]he rulings so far paint a remarkable portrait of a government rushing to implement sweeping changes in policy without regard for long-standing rules against arbitrary and capricious behavior. \u2026 \u201cTwo-thirds of the cases accuse the Trump administration of violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), a nearly 73-year-old law that forms the primary bulwark against arbitrary rule. The normal 'win rate' for the government in such cases is about 70\u00a0percent, according to analysts and studies. But as of mid-January, a\u00a0database maintained by the Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University School of Law\u00a0shows Trump\u2019s win rate at about 6\u00a0percent.\u201d (Here is a breakdown of the cases the Trump administration has lost.) -- A federal appeals court appeared skeptical of arguments that profits from Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel violate the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause. Ann E. Marimow and Jonathan O'Connell report: \u201cThe three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit was reviewing a novel case brought by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia \u2026 One judge, Dennis W. Shedd, suggested the president may actually be driving up business at other local hotels because of people who would be drawn to Washington to protest Trump\u2019s policies and would not choose to stay at the president\u2019s namesake hotel. Another, Paul V. Niemeyer, noted that the president had already stepped back from day-to-day management of Trump International Hotel.\u201d All three of the judges were appointed by Republican presidents, a fluke that prompted jokes from the Democratic attorneys general arguing the case: \u201cAt the 4th Circuit, the names of the three judges randomly assigned to each panel are made public on the morning of an oral argument. \u2026 When the two Democratic attorneys general first greeted each other Tuesday in the ornate, wood-paneled courtroom, they joked about the luck of the draw. \u2018Did you pick the panel?\u2019 [Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D)] joked, slapping his palm to his forehead in mock disbelief.\u201d -- Trump\u2019s Supreme Court appointees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, took opposing sides on two out of three rulings made by the court on Tuesday.\u00a0(Fox News) -- Three Native American inmates in a Texas prison won the right to let their hair grow long in a lawsuit over religious liberties.\u00a0From the Houston Chronicle\u2019s Keri Blakinger: \u201cThe prison system\u2019s rules requiring men to keep short hair or face disciplinary consequences, the inmates and their attorneys argued, were an unfair violation of religious freedom \u2026 Even though female prisoners are allowed to have long hair, attorneys for the state claimed that letting men do the same would cost too much money to police, that prisoners would get too hot in uncooled facilities, that it would make identifying inmates harder and that it could increase the number of inmate suicides.\u201d THE IMMIGRATION WARS: -- On a party-line vote, the Supreme Court decided that federal authorities have broad authority when imprisoning legal immigrants with criminal convictions who may be eligible for deportation. Robert Barnes reports: \u201cIt does not matter whether authorities pick up such noncitizens years after they have been released from criminal custody, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the majority in the 5-to-4 decision. Federal law mandates detention for certain immigrants while awaiting deportation proceedings. \u2018As we have held time and again, an official\u2019s crucial duties are better carried out late than never,\u2019 wrote Alito, joined in the outcome by his fellow conservatives.\u201d -- A Mexican migrant died Monday after being arrested by Customs and Border Protection agents.\u00a0The 40-year-old man, immigrations officials said, died after receiving treatment for flulike symptoms and liver and kidney failure. CBP has not released the man\u2019s name. In a statement, the ACLU\u2019s Border Rights Center director said a \u201ca transparent and independent investigation into the conditions at CBP detention facilities and its medical care practices is needed immediately.\u201d (AP) -- For months, Olivia Cross and her husband, Yahya Abedi, an Iranian man, were kept away from each other due to Trump\u2019s travel ban and were close to giving up hope on the right to a life together in the United States.\u00a0Now they\u2019ve been reunited, but others haven\u2019t been so lucky,\u00a0Kate Woodsome and Jason Rezaian write:\u00a0\u201cCross and Abedi are experiencing a kind of survivors\u2019 guilt, and Abedi is still counseling people stuck in administrative limbo. He is also taking in what it means to be a legal U.S. resident, with a clear path toward citizenship. \u2018The media in Iran tells us a lot of terrible things about this country, but never any of the good ones,\u2019 Abedi said. Asked what has surprised him most about the United States and how he has been treated by the Americans he\u2019s met so far, he has only one word: \u2018Respect.\u2019 Abedi hopes other people such as him, waiting to reunite with their loved ones, will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves.\u201d -- \u201cTheir ancestors fled U.S. slavery for Mexico. Now they\u2019re looking north again,\u201d by Kevin Sieff: \u201cTheir ancestors were African Americans who escaped from the United States to Mexico in the 19th century, fleeing the slave trade for a desert village at the base of the Sierra Madre mountains. They were called the Mascogos, roughly 60 black families who spoke and prayed in English as they hid from the white men who wanted to put them back in shackles. ...\u00a0Now members of this community of 300 are heading back to the United States.\u201d -- The New Zealand shooting has led to heightened scrutiny of European far-right parties from which the alleged perpetrator gleaned inspiration. James McAuley reports: \u201cTo many French Muslims, the Christchurch massacre was a tragic extension of normalized hatred that has also inspired anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant attacks \u2014 some of them foiled \u2014 in France and elsewhere in Europe. ...\u00a0Muslim advocates and journalists across the continent have pointed to the massacre to increase pressure on right-wing leaders and pundits, insisting that openly Islamophobic rhetoric carries with it the potential for deadly violence.\u201d TRUMP VS. THE GOP: -- Trump\u2019s recent criticisms of Fox News could mark a turning point in his relationship with the network, which has generally showered him with praise. Sarah Ellison and Paul Farhi report: \u201cThe spat comes as Fox\u2019s parent company is undergoing a generational change \u2014 one that produced another, perhaps more subtle sign of independence from the president. On Tuesday, Fox Corp. began public trading as the new parent of Fox News, Fox Entertainment and Fox Sports; the company is the result of 21st Century Fox\u2019s sale of its film and television assets to Disney Corp. The new company is headed by Lachlan Murdoch, the eldest son of Rupert Murdoch, who co-founded Fox News with Roger Ailes and remains a controlling shareholder in Fox. \u201cAmong Fox Corp.\u2019s first acts in business: appointing former House speaker Paul D. Ryan to its board of directors. Ryan is, of course, an establishment conservative disliked by both Democrats and those who most strongly supported Trump. Although he advanced some of Trump\u2019s agenda, particularly tax reform, as speaker, Ryan declined to defend Trump or campaign with him in the latter stages of the 2016 campaign. Trump\u2019s [critical tweets about Fox] served as a reminder that he is known for turning on members of his inner circle. \u2026 It also raised the question: Is the president changing his tune on Fox News? \u201c[Fox host Jeanine] Pirro and Trump speak regularly, and the two had a conversation before he tweeted, according to a person briefed on the call. The president\u2019s relationship with Pirro dates back decades and is rooted in their common presence in a certain New York social circle. Trump has granted Pirro regular interviews, and he encourages his advisers to do the same. \u2026 A source familiar with the inner workings of Fox News said the president isn\u2019t on the phone with producers or executives in charge of coverage. He calls opinion hosts with whom he has a preexisting relationship, this person said.\u201d -- Trump once again lashed out against John McCain, saying he was \u201cnever a fan\u201d of the\u00a0senator who died last year of brain cancer. John Wagner reports: \u201cTrump\u2019s comments came during a meeting in the Oval Office with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro in response to a reporter\u2019s questions about his continuing disparagement of McCain, including in multiple tweets over the weekend. \u2018I\u2019m very unhappy that he didn\u2019t repeal and replace Obamacare, as you know,\u2019 Trump said, referring to McCain\u2019s vote against overhauling the Affordable Care Act in July 2017. \u2018He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years, and then he got to a vote, and he said thumbs down.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018I think that\u2019s a disgrace, plus there are other things,\u2019 Trump said. \u2018I was never a fan of John McCain, and I never will be.\u2019\u201d -- Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) has had harsh words for Trump's posthumous McCain criticism, saying on the Senate floor in August that \u201canybody who in any way tarnishes the reputation of John McCain deserves a whipping.\u201d Isakson told the Bulwark he'll expand on his remarks later\u00a0on the Senate floor and that Trump's comments on McCain \u201cdrive me crazy.\u201d\u00a0 -- A top pro-Trump group launched ads supporting two of the president\u2019s top congressional allies, Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio) and Mark Meadows (N.C.). CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein reports: \u201cThe $100,000 ad buy is a sign that Trump-aligned groups are rewarding those loyal to the President. \u2026 In the past, America First Policies has hit members who did not support the administration's policy initiatives, including then-Sen. Dean Heller on health care and the late Rep. Walter Jones on the tax bill. \u2026 The ads feature video of Meadows and Jordan standing with Trump \u2014 literally \u2014 and urge supporters to call the Capitol switchboard and thank the congressmen \u2018for protecting America.\u2019\u201d Donald Trump Jr. hopped on the Brexit\u00a0debate by publishing an opinion piece in the Telegraph.\u00a0(Nicholas Kamm\/AFP\/Getty) THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- The president\u2019s son\u00a0Donald Trump Jr.\u00a0published an op-ed in the Telegraph saying Theresa May should\u2019ve taken his father\u2019s advice on Brexit. \u201cSince 2016, Prime Minister Theresa May has promised on more than 50 separate occasions that Britain would leave the EU on March 29 2019. She needs to honour that promise. But Mrs May ignored advice from my father, and ultimately, a process that should have taken only a few short months has become a years-long stalemate, leaving the British people in limbo. Now, the clock has virtually run out and almost all is lost \u2026 With the deadline fast approaching, it appears that democracy in the UK is all but dead.\u201d -- In her new book \u201cKushner, Inc.\u201d journalist Vicky Ward claims that Jared Kushner\u2019s peace plan included \u201cland swaps\u201d with Saudi Arabia and an oil pipeline from that kingdom into Gaza.\u00a0New York Magazine\u2019s Matt Stieb writes:\u00a0\u201cAccording to Ward, who spoke with \u2018multiple people who saw drafts of the plan,\u2019 Kushner proposed a geopolitical version of the multi-destination NBA player swap, in which Jordan would give territory to the Palestinian authority, and \u2018in return, Jordan would get land from Saudi Arabia, and that country would get back two Red Sea islands it gave Egypt to administer in 1950.\u2019\u201d In her book, Ward writes that Jared planned on having \u201cthe Saudis and Emiratis to provide economic assistance to the Palestinians. There were plans for an oil pipeline from Saudi Arabia to Gaza, where refineries and a shipping terminal could be built. The profits would create desalination plants, where Palestinians could find work, addressing the high unemployment rate.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 -- Trump met Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro at\u00a0the White House, and he definitely liked what he saw in the South American nation\u2019s far-right leader. Anne Gearan reports: \u201cFor Trump, the rise of a South American political admirer offers real economic and geopolitical advantages, and a measure of sweet revenge against critics who call both men crass race-baiters. Bolsonaro has embraced his nickname the \u2018Trump of the Tropics.\u2019 \u2018We do have a great deal of shared values. I admire President Donald Trump,\u2019 Bolsonaro said \u2026 Trump did not disagree as Bolsonaro said that \u2018Brazil and the United States stand side-by-side in their efforts to ensure liberty and respect for traditional family lifestyles with respect to God.\u2019 He added that they are also united \u2018against politically correct attitudes and against fake news.'\u201d -- Trump reportedly sidelined his top negotiator on North Korea and dismissed warnings from his top intelligence officials before meeting with Kim Jong Un in Vietnam last month. Time\u2019s John Walcott reports: \u201cIn recent days, Trump shut down an effort by Stephen Biegun, nominally the Administration\u2019s lead negotiator with Pyongyang, to reestablish a back channel through the North\u2019s United Nations mission in New York, according to four U.S. and South Korean officials.\u201d -- A new report alleges that U.S. airstrikes killed 14 civilians in Nairobi in five airstrikes between 2017 and 2018.\u00a0Max Bearak reports: \u201cThe accuracy of the U.S. military\u2019s drone strikes in Somalia has come under increased scrutiny since President Trump relaxed rules of engagement there in March 2017, when he declared the southern part of the country an 'area of active hostilities.'\u00a0Since then, the number of strikes \u2014 carried out by Reaper drones and manned aircraft \u2014 has dramatically increased, as have worries about a possible civilian toll. ...\u00a0In response to the report, U.S. Africa Command released its own assessments of the five highlighted strikes and maintained that they caused no civilian casualties, arguing that Amnesty\u2019s capability to gather intelligence in a war zone couldn\u2019t compare to the military\u2019s. The report says the civilian casualties it documents resulted from strikes that 'may amount to war crimes.'\u201d -- A report details the invasive and 'abusive' process transgender people must undergo in Japan to be legally recognized. Emily Tamkin reports: \u201cJapanese transgender people need to be at least 20 years old, get a diagnosis for 'gender identity disorder,'\u00a0undergo sex reassignment surgery, become irreversibly infertile through sterilization (characterized as 'abusive'\u00a0by the United Nations), have no underage children, and, if they are married, get divorced.\u201d -- Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev is leaving office after nearly three decades. Anton Troianovski reports: \u201cNazarbayev has ruled Kazakhstan, Central Asia\u2019s largest country, since it became an independent state with the collapse of the Soviet Union. On Tuesday, he said in a nationally televised address that after nearly 30 years in power, it was time to leave the presidency. ... Senate Chairman Kassym-Jomart Tokayev will take over as president until the next election, currently scheduled for 2020.\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Don Jr.'s op-ed\u00a0raised a lot of eyebrows: Obama's former acting solicitor general pushed back against Trump's attack on George Conway: From a former chairwoman of the New Hampshire GOP: Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) also criticized the president's attacks:\u00a0 The vice president visited those impacted by the flooding in Nebraska: A Democratic senator criticized Trump's foreign policy: A HuffPost contributor highlighted these divisive reactions to Rep. Ilhan Omar's op-ed on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: A HuffPost reporter and polling editor reminded her Twitter followers of this: Beto O'Rourke carried on his campaign trip to Pennsylvania: A Post video reporter mocked O'Rourke's tendency to stand on coffee counters: The director of engagement for the conservative Blaze Media cast a spotlight on O'Rourke's dog: A Guardian reporter noted this tweet from one of Bernie Sanders's campaign aides: An Atlantic editor analyzed Glenn Beck for falling under the spell of Trumpism: A Roll Call columnist highlighted this statistic from the CNN poll: This pro-Trump vehicle captured Washington's attention. From Sen. Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff: Twitter mocked Bryce Harper's short-lived record: And police officers in New York pursued an unusual investigation tactic:\u00a0 A Post reporter replied: GOOD READS FROM ELSEWHERE: -- CNN, \u201cHer son died. And then anti-vaxers attacked her,\u201d by Elizabeth Cohen and John Bonifield: \u201cInterviews with mothers who've lost children and with those who spy on anti-vaccination groups, reveal a tactic employed by anti-vaxers: When a child dies, members of the group sometimes encourage each other to go on that parent's Facebook page. The anti-vaxers then post messages telling the parents they're lying and their child never existed, or that the parent murdered them, or that vaccines killed the child, or some combination of all of those. Nothing is considered too cruel. Just days after their children died, mothers say anti-vaxers on social media called them whores, the c-word and baby killers. \u2026 Jill Promoli, who lives outside Toronto, lost her son to flu. She believes the anti-vaxers are trying to silence the very people who can make the strongest argument for vaccinations: those whose children died of vaccine-preventable illnesses.\u201d -- The Atlantic, \u201cThe Fertility Doctor's Secret,\u201d by Sarah Zhang:\u00a0\u201cThe first Facebook message arrived when Heather Woock was packing for vacation, in August 2017. It was from a stranger claiming to be her half sibling. She assumed the message was some kind of scam; her parents had never told her she might have siblings. But the message contained one detail that spooked her. The sender mentioned a doctor, Donald Cline. Woock knew that name; her mother had gone to Cline for fertility treatments before she was born. ...\u00a0They had found her on Facebook, she realized, after searching for the username linked to her Ancestry.com account. ...\u00a0Apparently she did have relatives on Ancestry.com ... They said their parents had also been treated by Cline. They said that decades ago, without ever telling his patients, Cline had used his own sperm to impregnate women who came to him for artificial insemination.\u00a0According to her DNA, Woock, too, was one of his children.\u201d HOT ON THE LEFT: \u201cHouse committee passes Amendment 4 bill along party lines,\u201d from the Tampa Bay Times: \u201cA Florida House committee approved a bill addressing the rollout of Amendment 4 despite concerns that it would limit the number of former felons who could have their voting rights restored. Voting along party lines, Republicans advanced the measure, which would require felons pay back all court fees and costs before being eligible to vote, even if those costs are not handed down by a judge as part of the person\u2019s sentence.

Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) on Capitol Hill\u00a0on Jan. 19, 2018. (Oliver Contreras for The Washington Post)\u00a0 Responsibility for the nation\u2019s cybersecurity is spread piecemeal throughout the government without a single person or agency in charge. That creates dangerous gaps that U.S. adversaries could exploit to hack the government or critical infrastructure, two prominent Senate Republicans told me. \u00a0 Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson (Wis.) and Mike Rounds (S.D.), chair of the Armed Services Committee\u2019s cyber panel, are mulling how they might create a centralized government authority for cybersecurity issues. The goal would be an office that could make sure the Homeland Security, Defense and Justice departments are effectively sharing information and working toward common goals, the senators said. \u00a0\u00a0 For example, the Defense Department, which is authorized to conduct clandestine military activities in cyberspace, might not be as clued in as DHS is to how some of those activities could prompt retaliation against U.S. businesses. Rounds also noted that some parts of the government were concerned for several years\u00a0that Chinese telecom giant Huawei could use its position inside global telecommunications infrastructure to spy on behalf of the Chinese government -- but the U.S. did not act until recently. \u201cOur role is to make sure we don\u2019t miss the seams between the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security, between DoD and the intelligence community,\u201d Rounds told me. The senators don\u2019t have a firm proposal for what the office would look like and are in the very early planning stages, they both said. Examining the issue probably will be a major focus for the Homeland Security Committee this Congress, Johnson told me. He\u2019s also open to considering vesting the authority in an existing agency, such as DHS or DoD, he said. \u201cWe need someone in charge,\u201d Johnson repeated several times. While details are far from clear, any solution would have to reduce bureaucracy rather than increase it, Rounds said. He praised a recent White House memo that eased the process for the military to launch offensive hacks as an example of a sucessful effort to make government cyber policy more agile and responsive to the nation's needs. That move was paired with new legislation that explicitly defined the military's authority to launch offensive cyber operations.\u00a0 \u201cBefore we take any action,\u00a0we want to make sure we\u2019ve basically vetted the process out and tried to take the whole nation into account,\u201d Rounds told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve got several different concepts laid out but not one that I\u2019ve felt comfortable enough to move forward with yet.\u201d DHS currently has primary authority for civilian cybersecurity while the Pentagon manages the military side. A DHS official told me in an email that\u00a0the department's \"top priority is ensuring effective operational relationships with our interagency partners in support of the private sector.\" The idea of a new overarching cyber agency got mixed reviews from former cyber officials I spoke to. \u00a0 Frank Cilluffo, a former White House cybersecurity official, said that reorganizing\u00a0government cyber authorities would be a \u201cdifficult task but probably worth doing.\u201d There probably would be turf battles between agencies, he said, and conflicts about broader goals. But that would be outweighed if the change resulted in a government that\u2019s fully coordinated around securing the nation against cyberthreats and punishing adversaries that launch them, said Cilluffo,\u00a0now the director of the McCrary Institute for Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection at Auburn University. Cilluffo compared the shift to the reorganizing of the intelligence community after 9\/11, when the shock of a major attack forced agencies to break down information stovepipes and to work more closely together. The government also created a director of national intelligence in the wake of that attack.\u00a0 \u201cI do think you need a quarterback who can orchestrate some of these pieces, and an offensive coordinator and a defensive coordinator who can put together a full game plan,\u201d Cilluffo told me. Yet Phil Reitinger, a former DHS cyber official, warned that reorganizing government might be less effective than making sure the current system is working as well as it should. Creating a new agency without working out exactly what\u2019s wrong with the current system is \u201ca recipe for disaster,\u201d he said. If agencies aren\u2019t coordinating enough on cybersecurity issues, then maybe DHS or the White House should be in charge of fixing that rather than a newly created agency, suggested Reitinger, who now leads the Global Cyber Alliance, a public-private partnership focused on raising international cybersecurity standards. \u201cI worry that reorganization as a solution is magical thinking,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Sen.

The legislation would create an exchange program allowing cyber professionals from\u00a0the private sector and the academic world to do tours of duty of up to two years in the federal government. \u201cOur country\u2019s cybersecurity should be a top priority, but currently, our government needs additional cyber security experts to ensure we are not vulnerable to attacks from adversaries and cybercriminals,\u201d Klobuchar said in a statement.

(Robert F. Bukaty\/AP) U.S. Cyber Command sent a loud and clear message when it shut off the Internet at a Russian troll farm during the midterm elections: The United States won\u2019t be a punching bag in cyberspace, especially when the 2020 election rolls around. That operation, which was first reported by my colleague Ellen Nakashima on Tuesday, prevented the Internet Research Agency, which spread disinformation during the 2016 election, from mounting\u00a0similar efforts on Election Day 2018 and for several days after. Russian officials did not confirm the strike but said U.S. cyberattacks routinely target Russian organizations, according to the TASS state-run news service.\u00a0 The IRA strike\u00a0marked the first time since 2016 that U.S. officials have acknowledged \u2014 even anonymously \u2014 launching an offensive cyber operation against their Russian adversaries.\u00a0And the only other offensive cyber operation the U.S. has ever acknowledged on the record\u00a0targeted ISIS digital recruiting operations and happened during President Obama's term. While it was public knowledge that ramping up offensive strikes\u00a0in cyberspace is a central tenet of the Trump administration\u2019s new cyber strategy, taking\u00a0credit for a specific move against an adversary takes it up a notch. Former officials say credit-claiming\u00a0helps set a global precedent for what sort of actions cross a line of unacceptable behavior in cyberspace -- and sends a strong signal to other nations that they risk consequences if they follow suit.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s important for the U.S. government to be more open about the fact it has these capabilities and it has a doctrine about how it\u2019s going to incorporate them into its foreign policy and national security strategy,\u201d\u00a0Michael Daniel, a former White House cyber coordinator during the Obama administration, told me.\u00a0 If anything, the Trump administration should be more transparent about offensive cyber operations so U.S. adversaries aren\u2019t confused about what will prompt a U.S. response and what won\u2019t, said Daniel, president of the Cyber Threat Alliance, a cybersecurity information-sharing group. \u201cThis does not mean drawing lines of \u2018if you do X, we will immediately do Y,\u2019 but there should be broad statements about the principles we\u2019ll uphold,\u201d according to Daniel, who said he urged similar transparency during the Obama administration.\u00a0 The general idea behind the Trump administration\u2019s pivot to offense\u00a0as outlined by national security adviser John Bolton in September was that Russia, China, Iran and North Korea hacked U.S. targets with abandon under President Barack Obama because they didn\u2019t fear the United States would hack them back. By counter-striking in cyberspace at key points, the United States will make those nations more cautious, Bolton said. But just shutting down a Russian troll farm for a couple days may not be enough to convince Russia not to interfere in the 2020 presidential contest, former officials tell me. \u201cI think it was worth doing,\u201d said Joel Brenner, a former senior counsel at the National Security Agency. \u201cBut it\u2019s likely to have a very slight deterrent effect because I don\u2019t see any penalty that\u2019s being imposed.\u201d Brenner compared the IRA operation to police making criminals stay home and stop committing crimes for a few days rather than actually locking them up in jail. \u201cIs that going to stop them from trying again?\u201d he asked. Thomas Rid, a strategic studies professor at Johns Hopkins University, described the operation to my colleague Ellen as \u201cmore of a pinprick that is more annoying than deterring in the long run.\u201d Jim Lewis, a former State and Commerce Department cyber official, was more bullish on the IRA operation\u2019s deterrent effect on Russia, but warned it may take more such operations before Russia is convinced to steer clear of undermining the 2020 contest. \u201cOur opponents didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever do anything to them and they sort of had carte blanche to get away with murder [in cyberspace],\u201d said Lewis, who now leads the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank\u2019s technology policy program. \u201cYou need to show you\u2019re willing to use these capabilities and this does that.\u201d The IRA counterstrike may do less for the government's broader efforts to deter cyber aggression, Lewis notes. It sends no clear signal, for example, to the United States' other main cyber adversary, China, which engages in a hacking pattern far different from Russia's. That\u2019s because China\u2019s bad behavior in cyberspace looks very different from Russia\u2019s, which makes it tough to glean clear lessons from the Russia counterstrike. While Russia threatens destructive attacks against U.S. infrastructure and influence operations that undermine elections, China is focused on stealing U.S. companies\u2019 intellectual property and trade secrets. The United States is also more tightly bound to China through trade relationships, which means punching back in cyberspace could have damaging consequences in other realms. That said, the IRA operation could have a deterrent effect on the other main U.S. cyber adversaries, Iran and North Korea, whose bad behavior in cyberspace looks more similar to Russia's, Lewis\u00a0told me. \u201cIf our opponents think it\u2019s an open field, then there\u2019s nothing to stop them, and that\u2019s destabilizing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a way to draw boundaries, to increase stability. Hopefully by the time of 2020, it\u2019s taken hold.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 Robert L.

Cummings (D-Md.) on Friday said President Trump\u2019s lawyers gave shifting explanations to federal ethics officials about Trump\u2019s reimbursement of a payment Michael Cohen made to an adult-film actress before the 2016 election, calling on the White House to turn over documents related to the transaction. In a letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone, Cummings said documents his committee obtained from the federal Office of Government Ethics show that lawyers for Trump offered \u201cevolving stories\u201d about the president\u2019s payments to Cohen, his longtime personal attorney. OGE officials appeared skeptical of their explanations, Cummings wrote. The White House and the Office of Government Ethics did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cohen, who pleaded guilty last year to campaign-finance violations and lying to Congress, has admitted he paid $130,000 to actress Stormy Daniels in October 2016. Daniels says she had a sexual encounter with Trump years earlier and Cohen has said the payment was to buy her silence. Later, Cohen asked Trump\u2019s company for reimbursement \u2014 and the Trump Organization paid him a total of $420,000, according to court papers. Cohen said in court that he had made the payments \u201cin coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office.\u201d Trump initially said last year that he did not know about Cohen\u2019s payment to Daniels. But his attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani revealed in a television interview that Trump had reimbursed Cohen. The president then acknowledged that he paid Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop what Trump called \u201cfalse and extortionist accusations.\u201d In a footnote on his personal financial disclosure filed last May, Trump reported a reimbursement of up to $250,000 to Cohen. He said he was disclosing it \u201cin the interest of transparency,\u201d stressing that it was not required to be reported as a debt. At the time, Giuliani told The Washington Post that he had publicly discussed Trump\u2019s payments to Cohen because he knew the information would come out in the president\u2019s financial disclosure. \u201cI wanted it out there so it wasn\u2019t a big surprise,\u201d he said. In fact, a timeline released by Cummings Friday indicates that Giuliani\u2019s revelation prompted ethics officials days later to press the president\u2019s attorneys about Trump\u2019s payments to Cohen. The president\u2019s lawyers \u2014 who had repeatedly told ethics officials in the preceding months that Trump did not owe money to Cohen \u2014 then told OGE that the payments were legal fees that were not required to be reported. Giuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Stefan Passantino, a former deputy White House counsel who now works as an outside lawyer for the Trump Organization, declined to comment. Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, also declined to comment.  In letters to the White House and the Trump Organization, Cummings urged them to cooperate with the committee\u2019s investigation and turn over documents it has requested. He noted that the White House indicated it is \u201cprepared to consider\u201d allowing committee staff to review some material in person. Cummings said that was not good enough. \u201cYour offer does not obviate the need for the White House to fully comply with the committee\u2019s request,\u201d he wrote.","85":"D.C. Council member Jack Evans has repeatedly emailed business proposals to law firms that lobby District officials, offering his connections and influence amassed as the city\u2019s longest-serving lawmaker. In a January 2018 pitch to Nelson Mullins, a law firm that had lobbied his office on behalf of a client just months before, Evans said the firm should employ him because as an elected official and chairman of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, he could engage in \u201ccross-marketing my relationships and influence to Nelson Mullins clients.\u201d Using her government email account, Evans\u2019s chief of staff sent similar proposals on his behalf in 2015 to the firms Venable and K&L; Gates, as well as to Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, which hired him. Evans, a Democrat representing Ward 2, and his chief of staff, Schannette Grant, did not respond to requests for comment. The pitches \u2014 obtained by The Washington Post through a Freedom of Information Act request \u2014 show how one of the District\u2019s most powerful public officials sought simultaneously to work in the private sector on behalf of companies looking to navigate the landscape of local government. And the proposals come to light as federal prosecutors are scrutinizing Evans\u2019s business affairs. In September, a federal grand jury issued a subpoena to D.C. officials for documents relating to legislation Evans promoted in 2016 that would have benefited a digital-sign company, Digi Outdoor Media. Evans had received and has said he returned money and stock from the company. \u201cWhile I would not be able to directly lobby the District government, I could certainly use my knowledge of local government to strategize with someone looking to do business locally,\u201d Evans said in the 2015 pitch. D.C. law permits elected officials to hold jobs in the private sector. But of the 13 members of the D.C. Council, just one other, Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), reports significant and continuing outside income on required financial disclosures. Cheh is a constitutional-law professor at George Washington University. Throughout his 28-year tenure on the council, Evans has engaged in outside legal and consulting work. In required disclosures, he has listed law firms for which he has worked but has not named his clients. D.C. ethics rules require him to identify clients only if they have contracts with the District or stand to benefit from pending legislation. As chair of the committee on finance and revenue, Evans has significant sway over the city\u2019s tax policy, finances and tourism industry. As chairman of WMATA, Evans oversees contracting and policy for a regional transit agency with a $3\u00a0billion budget. From 2001 to 2015, Evans worked at the powerhouse law and lobby firm Patton Boggs, where his focus included \u201cgovernment and Congressional relations, business law and corporate securities,\u201d according to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He has said he earned $190,000 per year from the firm in outside income. He earns $140,161 annually as a D.C. Council member. Evans sent his 2018 proposal to Nelson Mullins lawyer Timothy Fitzgibbon, who did not respond to a request for comment. There is no indication that the firm hired or retained Evans. In the pitch, Evans remarked that the District\u2019s government \u201cis the flattest political organization in the country.\u201d \u201cThere are just 15 elected officials in the city: one mayor, 13 councilmembers, and one attorney general,\u201d Evans wrote. \u201cA contract, bill, or regulation can go from idea to consummation in a matter of months.\u201d Evans continued: \u201cDespite this fertile ground, no local firm has yet to establish itself as the \u2018Go-To\u2019 government relations firm. The opportunity to claim this mantle is clear.\u201d Among the recipients of Evans\u2019s 2015 pitch was John Ray, a former council member and a partner at Manatt. Ray or an associate had lobbied Evans on behalf of energy giant Exelon only months earlier. Ray did not respond a request for comment. That proposal included the District of Columbia in a list of potential clients Evans said he could help attract. The list also included businesses with which he had dealt as a council member, among them Xerox, Uber, Fort Myer Construction and the hotel company Marriott. \u201cI am looking to continue my law practice while continuing to serve on the City Council,\u201d Evans wrote. Evans began working for Manatt in October 2015. That month, his signature was first among those of seven council members who, under D.C. Council letterhead, urged the Public Service Commission to approve a merger between Exelon and Pepco. The letter did not disclose a relationship between Evans and Exelon\u2019s lobbying firm. A spokeswoman for Exelon declined to comment Friday. Evans was reelected to his latest four-year term in 2016. He stopped working at Manatt in October 2017, according to his financial disclosures. By that time, he had created his own firm, NSE Consulting, which was named in the grand jury subpoena in September seeking information relating to Evans and the digital-sign company.","86":"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos just announced she is backing Senate legislation that would create the first federally funded school tax credit, so it seems like a good time to see which states spend public money to send kids to private and religious schools \u2014 and how much. To be clear, the legislation has virtually no chance of passing Congress; Democrats control the House, and most of them wouldn\u2019t support it. A similar idea couldn\u2019t muster enough enthusiasm a few years ago when Republicans controlled the House and the Senate. It is worth noting that DeVos opposes federal involvement in education \u2014 she once said \u201cgovernment sucks\u201d \u2014 and she believes that choice programs, like all education, are best at the state and local level. She couldn\u2019t, of course, oppose a federal choice program. But she isn\u2019t likely to appreciate federal restrictions that would necessarily be attached to the money. Tax credits are just one of the programs that fall under the branch of the \u201cschool choice\u201d movement that seeks to use public money to send children to private and religious schools \u2014 even when those schools can legally discriminate against LBGTQ students and other groups of students. There are, however, differences in how the programs work throughout the country, structured according to the laws of each state. The issue is central to the national education debate. Supporters say families should have options for their children. Opponents say it is unconstitutional to use public funds for religious education and that these programs drain resources from public school districts that educate most of America\u2019s children. The Supreme Court is expected to soon get a case that addresses the constitutionality of voucher programs. Under tax credit scholarship programs, donors take tax deductions for contributions they make to a state-sanctioned entity that distributes those contributions to qualified students who then use the money for private and religious schools. There are, according to the pro-choice nonprofit group EdChoice, 23 tax-credit scholarship programs in 18 states: Alabama, Arizona (4), Florida (2), Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, New Hampshire, Nevada, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania (2), Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota and Virginia. EdChoice is an Indiana-based nonprofit with a mission to privatize the public education system through a universal voucher system. (You can learn about its philosophy in this 1995 op-ed written for The Washington Post by Milton Friedman, who funded the predecessor organization that became EdChoice. The headline: \u201cPublic schools: Make them private.\u201d) The legislation supported by DeVos \u2014 being introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) \u2014 would provide a 100 percent federal tax credit for donations by individuals or companies that help send children to private school. Spending on the program would be capped at $5 billion. Voucher programs give families a portion of the public funding that would be used for a child\u2019s education in a public school and allow them to use the money in the form of a voucher for tuition at private and religious schools. EdChoice says there are 25 voucher programs in 15 states: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana (2), Maine, Maryland, Mississippi (2), New Hampshire, North Carolina (2), Ohio (5), Oklahoma, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin (4). The nation\u2019s capital also has a program, and it is the only one funded by the federal government. Educational savings accounts are personal accounts created by a state for parents to use for a range of educational costs, including private school tuition and fees, private tutoring, online learning programs and other uses. The money comes from state education funds. EdChoice says five states offer such funds, which often are given to families by debit card. They are Arizona, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee. DeVos has made clear that her view of educational success by states is how much \u201cchoice\u201d parents are given. So which state spends the most on programs that use public money for private education? As it turns out, it isn\u2019t Michigan, the home state of billionaire DeVos. She spent decades there trying to expand choice, succeeding with charter schools but not voucherlike programs. The state that spends the most is one in which she maintains a vacation home. It\u2019s Florida, which became a school choice pioneer under Jeb Bush when he was governor from 1999 to 2007. DeVos and Bush have been school choice allies for years, and her department has hired key officials with links to Bush. She has repeatedly called Florida a national model for choice. According to EdChoice, Florida spends by far the most \u2014 in terms of percentage of budget and in dollars \u2014 on school choice. In its latest ranking, published in January, EdChoice said Florida spent $969.6 million on educational savings accounts, vouchers and tax credit programs in 2016, the latest available data. That was 3.69 percent of the state\u2019s combined program and public K-12 expenditures. EdChoice used state public expenditure data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2016 Public Elementary-Secondary Education Finance Data report. New Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) just announced a tax credit program that would boost that spending significantly if the legislature, as expected, passes it. Florida has been at the top of the list for a number of years. When looking at dollars spent, Ohio was second, spending $324.1 million, and Wisconsin was third, with $271.9 million. But Arizona was second in terms of percentage, at 2.83 percent of its total K-12 expenditures. Wisconsin was third, with 2.66 percent. Here\u2019s the top 10 in the EdChoice list, and you can see the entire thing here. The numbers in the parentheses after the state name indicate its ranking from the previous year. 1.

And we can add that one to the list of serious investigations President Trump has faced, including of himself, his campaign, his conduct as president, his business, his charity and his \u201cuniversity.\u201d Below, we break down the latest in each, along with how much trouble each could pose for Trump. The latest: Federal prosecutors in the Justice Department\u2019s Southern District of New York issued a wide-ranging subpoena Monday seeking documents related to spending and donations by the committee that put on Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration \u2014 including possible foreign contributions, which would be illegal. Trouble factor: This probe was first reported in December by the Wall Street Journal, but we didn\u2019t know much about it until Monday. The sweeping nature of the documents request suggests a serious criminal inquiry \u2014 including, according to The Washington Post\u2019s Rosalind S. Helderman and Michael Kranish, possible conspiracy to defraud the United States, mail fraud, false statements, wire fraud and money laundering. Notably, the inaugural committee\u2019s fundraising operation was headed by Rick Gates, a former deputy Trump campaign manager who has pleaded guilty in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Russia investigation and is cooperating as part of a deal. It\u2019s also notable that the subpoena specifically mentions a donor, Los Angeles venture capitalist Imaad Zuberi, which suggests there is a reason for that specific interest. The latest: Ten days ago, longtime Trump political adviser Roger Stone was indicted on a charge of obstructing an investigation of his contacts with WikiLeaks, which released Democratic emails hacked by Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. We also learned that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort allegedly lied about sending polling information and discussing a pro-Russian Ukraine \u201cpeace plan\u201d with a business associate linked to Russian intelligence in 2016. And in December, Michael Cohen, a former personal lawyer for Trump, pleaded guilty to lying about his efforts to secure a Trump Tower in Moscow well into the 2016 campaign \u2014 including obscuring his contacts with aides in the Kremlin. Trouble factor: None of these charges or plea deals \u2014 or any charges or plea deals in the Mueller investigation \u2014 has dealt with collusion or related crimes. But that doesn\u2019t mean Mueller isn\u2019t pursuing them. (Often prosecutors will charge small things before bigger things and keep evidence of larger crimes hidden.) And all three situations \u2014 and the fact that each man allegedly lied about election-year contacts related to Russia \u2014 suggest that this remains a significant area of interest for Mueller. We also don\u2019t know how much interest remains in the Trump Tower meeting Donald Trump Jr. set up with a Russian lawyer in 2016, but there is no indication that Mueller has interviewed Trump Jr., which some suggest could mean trouble for him. Politico has reported Trump Jr. telling friends that he\u2019s worried about being indicted. The latest: This investigation is more difficult to grasp, given we don\u2019t know what we see in public would be of interest to Mueller. BuzzFeed reported that Cohen has told investigators that Trump asked him to lie to Congress about Trump Tower Moscow, but Mueller\u2019s team took the unprecedented step of issuing a denial. Trump has suggested investigations of Cohen\u2019s family, leading to Cohen pulling out of public testimony and allegations of witness tampering. And there have been many other examples of Trump either applying pressure to or otherwise weighing in on key figures in the Russia inquiry, starting with former FBI director James B. Comey. Trouble factor: We simply have no idea, and it all depends on what the threshold is for obstruction of justice. Although any one action, such as firing Comey, may not rise to that level, there is a clear pattern of behavior possibly geared toward affecting the investigation. Also notably, William P. Barr, Trump\u2019s nominee to become attorney general, in his confirmation hearing affirmed statements made in a 2017 memo that a president can commit obstruction of justice just as anybody else can. The latest: In December, we learned that the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc., has been given immunity in SDNY\u2019s investigation of hush-money payments made on Trump\u2019s behalf of Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels, who said they had affairs with him. SDNY also made clear that AMI said the McDougal payment was intended \u201cto suppress [McDougal\u2019s] story so as to prevent it from influencing the election.\u201d That\u2019s key, because that\u2019s the threshold for these payments being considered campaign finance violations. That means now both Cohen and AMI have said these payments were about the campaign. Trouble factor: In his guilty plea last year, Cohen implicated Trump in those campaign finance violations. Now, more people are establishing these as crimes. That doesn\u2019t mean prosecutors regard Trump as having done anything illegal. Trump admits that he directed the payments but says he didn\u2019t direct Cohen to make them illegally. Cohen says Trump knew it would be illegal, but the question is whether he has proof and how much proof prosecutors require. The unknown levels of cooperation of both AMI head David Pecker and longtime Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg loom very large here. The latest: The Trump Organization is the common thread that could play in several of these investigations. But as for it specifically, attorneys general in Maryland and the District of Columbia have subpoenaed financial records and documents related to Trump\u2019s business as part of the lawsuit regarding whether it violates the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause. The new attorney general of New York, Letitia James, has also said she plans to open large inquiries into Trump\u2019s business practices, including a New York Times report that Trump\u2019s father, Fred Trump, passed hundreds of millions of dollars in wealth to his children through tax schemes. \u201cI will be shining a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings, and every dealing, demanding truthfulness at every turn,\u201d James said. Trouble factor: In this case, it\u2019s the states investigating Trump and the Justice Department that is defending Trump, particularly when it comes to the emoluments case. House Democrats are also promising to dig into all this. But beyond the alleged tax schemes \u2014 which are very possibly beyond the statute of limitations \u2014 we don\u2019t know a whole lot about alleged criminal activity. The latest: Trump agreed in December to shut down his charity after years of investigations \u2014 most notably by The Post\u2019s David A. Fahrenthold and the New York attorney general\u2019s office \u2014 of his use of it for personal and political purposes. Trouble factor: The settlement arose out of a lawsuit filed by then-New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood (whom James replaced). Underwood has urged the IRS and the Federal Election Commission to look into whether the charity broke tax laws. It\u2019s not clear whether they are investigating, but election law experts say there is cause. The latest: A federal judge in April finalized a $25 million settlement for thousands of students who claimed they were defrauded by Trump University, a for-profit real estate seminar Trump set up that was not accredited. Trouble factor: It doesn\u2019t appear as though Trump faces further legal exposure. A Florida lawyer who wanted to reject the settlement so Trump could be brought to trial was unable to get an appeals court to side with her.","88":"Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) has decided not to run for president, declining to join a crowded race that includes a half-dozen of his Senate colleagues. Merkley announced his decision to supporters Tuesday morning. Instead of vying for the White House, he will seek a third term in the Senate in 2020. \u201cI\u2019ve got this limited number of years of life on this planet \u2014 how can I have the biggest impact?\u201d Merkley said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been weighing. And I\u2019ve reached the conclusion that the biggest impact I can have is here in the Senate.\u201d The 62-year-old senator would have started the presidential contest as a long shot. Outside of his home state, he is not very well-known. He would have faced the daunting task of introducing himself to a broad audience in a crowded field featuring other candidates who have spent weeks or months campaigning. Merkley, who is one of the Senate\u2019s most liberal members, identified three \u201cmega crises\u201d he wants to help address: a \u201ccrisis of our democracy,\u201d rooted in voting and campaign finance laws; an \u201copportunity crisis\u201d for families to thrive; and \u201cclimate chaos.\u201d The Oregonian was the only senator to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 Democratic primary against Hillary Clinton, the eventual nominee. But Sanders will not automatically have his support this time, Merkley said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any plans to endorse anybody for a good length of time,\u201d he said. Merkley said he hopes to encourage the Democratic presidential field to take on the three crises he identified. Merkley will be heavily favored to retain his Senate seat in 2020. His is one of 12 seats Democrats are defending, compared with 22 for Republicans. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report has regarded the Oregon seat as solidly Democratic. The Oregon Democrat was first elected to the Senate in 2008 and reelected to a second term in 2014. Before joining Congress, he served in the Oregon legislature, climbing the ranks to become speaker of the state House in 2007. In the Senate, Merkley is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, a sweeping climate resolution championed by the left and strongly opposed by conservatives. He is also a co-sponsor of a bill to establish a Medicare-for-all system of health coverage. Merkley has been an outspoken opponent of the Trump administration\u2019s hard-line immigration and border security policies. He traveled to the border with Mexico throughout 2018, visiting detention facilities and reporting on his findings. The senator was an early opponent of migrant family separations at the border in 2018, setting off a national debate when he tried to visit a holding facility and was turned away \u2014 a trip he documented live on social media. Soon after, other lawmakers started traveling to the border. Later this month, he plans to visit the border area once again. Merkley was also active in opposing President Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court picks. In 2017, he staged a protest of now-Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, which attracted widespread attention. He took to the Senate floor for about 15 straight hours to speak out against Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, remaining in the chamber overnight to deliver his remarks. Merkley said the decision on the presidential race was \u201cthe most difficult decision I\u2019ve addressed in my life.\u201d","89":"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina \u2014 Argentina\u2019s soccer association announced Saturday that the national women\u2019s league will be granted professional status, marking a milestone in a country that is home to Lionel Messi and some of the world\u2019s greatest players but still views soccer as largely a men\u2019s game. At a press conference on the outskirts of the capital of Buenos Aires, the association said that each of the 16 clubs of the women\u2019s top division must now have at least eight professional contracts with female players. The contracts must also mirror those of the professional men\u2019s league. \u201cWhen we assumed responsibility, we said we were going to oversee inclusive soccer that is gender equal, and we are demonstrating that,\u201d said AFA President Claudio Tapia. Tapia said that the association will contribute 120,000 pesos (about $3,000) per month to each club to finance the contracts. Up until now, the women\u2019s game has been played by amateur athletes who have gotten little to no money for their work on the field. The national team\u2019s female players have also struggled financially and went on strike in 2017 after their stipends of about $10 went unpaid. With Saturday\u2019s announcement, professional female players will now receive a monthly minimum salary of about 15,000 pesos, or $365, which is equivalent to that earned by male players in the fourth division of Argentine soccer. Sergio Marchi, leader of the soccer players\u2019 union, held up a copy of a contract and said, \u201cWith this we are generating a legal framework and a way to be able to advance professionally. This is the base, it is the beginning. It is in each of us to develop it.\u201d The professionalization of the sport gained momentum this year when soccer player Macarena Sanchez was dismissed by the UAI Urquiza team, which is the current league champion in Argentina. She then decided to launch a legal complaint seeking compensation and professional status. Female soccer players around the world have recently embarked on similar quests. Earlier this month, the U.S. women\u2019s national soccer team sued the U.S. Soccer Federation for \u201cinstitutionalized gender discrimination\u201d that includes unequal pay with their counterparts on the men\u2019s national team. Tapia said that professional recognition in Argentina is just the tip of the iceberg, but some advances will largely depend on the commitment of clubs and their ability to generate sponsorships and television rights. Mariana Frambati, a forward for Banfield, called it a \u201chistoric day.\u201d \u201cThis will affect those who are younger, who can take this activity more seriously as a future, a job. So that generations to come can develop and play starting from when they are young,\u201d she said.","90":"Top Democrats in Congress want the FBI to investigate a Chinese American business executive accused of using her access to President Trump to facilitate opportunities for Chinese executives, activities that came to light after a Florida massage parlor she founded was linked to a sex trafficking and prostitution ring. In a letter to the heads of the FBI, national intelligence agencies and Secret Service, the top Intelligence and Judiciary committee Democrats in the Senate and House asked for investigations into \u201ccredible allegations of potential human trafficking, as well as unlawful foreign lobbying, campaign finance and other activities\u201d by Li \u201cCindy\u201d Yang, a naturalized U.S. citizen from China. Yang, a Republican donor, has made frequent visits to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club and attended the president\u2019s Super Bowl party this year, snapping a selfie with the president during the event. It is that level of contact \u2014 though it appears that Yang often had to pay her way into events \u2014 that has congressional investigators concerned that her activities \u201ccould permit adversary governments or their agents access to these same politicians to acquire potential material for blackmail or other even more nefarious purposes.\u201d They acknowledged, however, that Yang may not have had such compromising intentions and that her \u201cactivities may only be those of an unscrupulous actor allegedly selling access to politicians for profit.\u201d Evan W. Turk, an attorney for Yang, said a legal team has reviewed the allegations, which he described as \u201cpolitically driven.\u201d \u201cWe have seen the Democratic partisan letter and allegations. Our firm will represent our client and her interest as an American through any developments in this case. It seems [like] another politically driven expedition. We will be addressing these matters when appropriate,\u201d Turk said in a statement to The Washington Post. The FBI, the director of national intelligence, the Secret Service and the White House all declined to comment. The letter\u2019s authors requested a response by the close of business Thursday. The effort was endorsed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who in a joint statement Monday said \u201cthe facts in this situation are very concerning\u201d and urged the FBI \u201cto adhere to the joint bicameral requests .\u2009.\u2009. and start an investigation.\u201d Yang founded a chain of Florida spas and massage parlors, including Orchids of Asia, the establishment where New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was accused of soliciting prostitution in a recent sting. Kraft has pleaded not guilty. Although Yang has not been charged in that investigation \u2014 and sold the day spa in question six years ago, her lawyer said \u2014 the episode has increased scrutiny of her other businesses, at least one of which congressional investigators worry could pose national security concerns. Yang operates a company called GY US Investments, which offered prospective clients a chance to rub elbows with Trump and other powerful politicians through dinners, fundraisers and other events \u2014 including at Mar-a-Lago. In one instance in late 2017, the Miami Herald reported, Yang boasted of bringing a group of Chinese executives to a fundraiser in New York \u2014 which is legal as long as they were guests and didn\u2019t reimburse Yang for their entry. Democrats suspect, however, that they might have. In the Democrats\u2019 letter, Sens. Mark R. Warner (Va.) and Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) and Reps. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.) and Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.) asked whether Yang or others were \u201coffering foreigners access to the President, those close to him, or other senior officials in exchange for money\u201d \u2014 and if the Trump campaign was doing a thorough job to ensure that the funds weren\u2019t \u201cbeing contributed illicitly or through straw donors.\u201d They also asked whether Yang or her clients had violated foreign lobbying laws \u2014 and whether her actions had brought her to the attention of law enforcement, whether for her business ties, national security concerns or human trafficking.","91":"Ctrl + N Sen. Amy Klobuchar\u00a0(D-Minn.) at a rally announcing that\u00a0she is entering the race for president on Feb. 10\u00a0in Minneapolis. (Jim Mone\/AP) Amy Klobuchar has positioned herself as a strong critic\u00a0of Silicon Valley in Congress. As a 2020 presidential contender, she will take that message to the campaign trail.\u00a0 During a blustery snowstorm on Sunday afternoon, the senator from Minnesota told supporters at a rally announcing her candidacy that it\u2019s time for tougher Internet privacy laws -- and slammed\u00a0Big Tech for being too lax with its data practices.\u00a0 \u201cWe need to put some digital rules of the road into law when it comes to privacy,\u201d she said. \u201cFor too long the big tech companies have been telling you: \u2018Don\u2019t worry! We\u2019ve got your back!\u2019 while your identities in fact are being stolen and your data is mined.\u201d Klobuchar also pledged to guarantee net neutrality-- rules that say Internet providers can't block or slow down websites -- and promised to connect every American household to the Internet by 2022. Klobuchar\u2019s decision to make privacy and Internet connectivity a central focus of her campaign\u00a0could elevate tech policy issues during the Democratic primary. By touting these issues during her first major speech as a 2020 contender, Klobuchar is making a big bet that privacy and other digital concerns are increasingly important to American voters. It's especially striking since tech policy is not generally an issue that drives\u00a0voters\u2019 feet to the polls. In a\u00a0survey about voter priorities ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, Gallup listed health care, the economy and immigration as the top concerns among voters. Technology wasn\u2019t even included in the 12 issues on the list.\u00a0Yet if Klobuchar shows Democratic voters \u2014 especially key demographics like millennials\u00a0\u2014 are paying attention, other politicians may start to\u00a0prioritize\u00a0issues like privacy and net neutrality in campaigns. \u201cWay too many politicians have their heads stuck in the sand when it comes to the digital revolution,\u201d she said. \u201cHey guys, it\u2019s not just coming, it\u2019s here. And if you don\u2019t know the difference between a hack and Slack, it\u2019s time to pull off the digital highway.\u201d Advocates for consumer privacy welcomed Klobuchar's remarks, saying they're a preview of what's to come this election cycle.\u00a0 \u201cPrivacy, and more generally regulation of online services, will be top issues in the 2020 election,\u201d Marc Rotenberg, executive director and president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told me.\u00a0 Klobuchar's decision to focus on tech issues also caught the attention of many closely following the 2020 race on Twitter.\u00a0Rolling Stone Washington bureau chief Andy\u00a0Kroll said:\u00a0 Los Angeles\u00a0Times White House reporter Eli Stokols weighed in:\u00a0 Americans are eager for change in Silicon Valley-- even if that's not the top issue driving their votes. About half of Americans think technology companies should be regulated more than they are now, according to a study from the Pew Research Center published last year. Focusing on tech in in a campaign could be a\u00a0strategy that\u00a0particularly appeals to Democrats:\u00a057 percent of Democrats or Democratic-leaners told Pew that major tech companies should be regulated more. One way Klobuchar could drive her tech-focused pitch\u00a0with voters is by connecting it to her broader economic message. In doing so, she would create a stark contrast from President Trump, whose economic pitch has focused largely on reviving jobs from legacy industries\u00a0such as\u00a0manufacturing. And in another example, Trump\u00a0never said the word \"technology\" in his State of the Union address last week.\u00a0 In her speech, Klobuchar criticized Washington leaders for sitting on the sidelines as the economy changed and Americans confronted the \"disruptive nature of new technologies.\"\u00a0 \"For a moment, let's stop seeing those obstacles as obstacles on our path,\" Klobuchar said. \"Let's see those obstacles as our path.\"\u00a0 Klobuchar's focus on technology issues could be a strategic decision to highlight the tech-focused legislation she drafted as a senator -- and distinguish herself from other candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination. Klobuchar has been able to draft legislation on tech issues with Republicans.\u00a0\u00a0As she makes the case that she\u2019s a Midwestern centrist amid a field of progressives, her tech record shows she can work across the aisle. This year, she reintroduced a Internet privacy bill called the Social Media Privacy and Consumer Rights Act. Amid a broader push in Congress to pass privacy legislation by the end of this year, it\u2019s one of the few bipartisan proposals that has been introduced. She also worked with then-Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) to create legislation would force technology companies to be more transparent about who is buying political ads on their platforms. The bill, which was introduced in 2017, stalled in the Senate, but some technology companies like Facebook said they would support it under intense political pressure\u00a0, and the social network introduced new labels for political ads so users could see ad disclosures.\u00a0 She also was a key sponsor of the bipartisan Secure Elections Act, which aimed to secure the U.S. election system from cyber attacks. The bill gained steam this summer and appeared likely to pass, but it later stalled as negotiations broke down with the White House.\u00a0\u00a0 She's not the only one bringing tech policy chops to the race, though other Democratic candidates have so far not drilled in on tech policy the same way as Klobuchar in announcing their bids.\u00a0Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) was known for her record on \"revenge porn\" as a California attorney general and a career prosecutor. As a senator, she co-sponsored bipartisan legislation that would make extortion with\u00a0threats to publish explicit images online illegal.\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) record of targeting\u00a0powerful corporations could position her as a strong voice on tech policy in the 2020 race. She's said the country needs tougher rules to respond to the massive scale of technology companies like Amazon.\u00a0 Lesser-known candidates such as Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., former Maryland congressman John Delaney and business executive Andrew Yang also have tech experience. Buttigieg led his city through a major tech transformation since taking over in 2011, bringing startup opportunities to a town known for manufacturing. Delaney co-founded the House Artificial Intelligence Caucus and has made the future of work key to his campaign. Yang is a former entrepreneur, and he\u2019s campaigning on issues related to artificial intelligence. These candidates know it\u2019s no easy task to appeal to voters on tech issues. Buttigieg says it\u2019s all about making it personal and relatable to voters. \u201cWe need to make sure that these don\u2019t sound like abstract conversations,\u201d Buttigieg told me at a Technology 202 live event. \u201cPeople want to know about what\u2019s going to happen to me.\u201d BITS: Federal prosecutors are reviewing Amazon founder and\u00a0chief executive Jeffrey P.\u00a0Bezos's\u00a0accusations against the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company\u00a0American Media Inc., The Washington Post's\u00a0Devlin Barrett, Matt Zapotosky and Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reported. Prosecutors are seeking to determine whether AMI may have run afoul of a non-prosecution agreement signed in September as part of an investigation into\u00a0campaign finance violations by Michael Cohen, former personal lawyer for President Trump. Bezos also owns The Washington Post. Bezos\u00a0has accused the Enquirer\u00a0and AMI of seeking to extort and blackmail him. He said they threatened\u00a0to publish explicit photos of him unless he issued a statement saying that the tabloid's coverage of his relationship with\u00a0former TV anchor Lauren Sanchez was not politically motivated.\u00a0But an attorney for AMI chief executive\u00a0David J. Pecker said the National Enquirer didn't extort or blackmail Bezos, the Associated Press's Michael Balsamo reported. \u201cI think both Bezos and AMI had interests in resolving their interests,\u201d Elkan Abramowitz, an attorney\u00a0for Pecker, said on\u00a0ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d according to the AP.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely not a crime to ask somebody to simply tell the truth. Tell the truth that this was not politically motivated, and we will print no more stories.\u201d Sanchez\u2019s brother, Michael Sanchez, provided the intimate exchanges to the Enquirer,\u00a0the Daily Beast\u2019s Lachlan Markay reported. \u201cNo one who spoke to The Daily Beast implied that Michael Sanchez in any way hacked his sister\u2019s phone, and he has not been charged with any crime,\u201d Markay wrote. \u201cIn fact, three people familiar with the Bezos-funded probe told The Daily Beast in late January that it had found no evidence of a hack.\u201d\u00a0 \u2014 More news about the feud between Bezos and the Enquirer: NIBBLES:\u00a0Trump plans to sign an executive order today that would\u00a0launch a U.S. national strategy on artificial intelligence. The American AI Inititiative aims to accelerate U.S. leadership in developing artificial intelligence, largely through\u00a0encouraging AI research and development within the government.\u00a0Other countries, such as China, have coordinated national strategies on emerging technology, and the Trump administration is rolling out this executive order amid growing concerns about the threat China's increased investment in AI poses to the U.S. economy. \"The U.S. is the world leader in artificial intelligence,\" an administration official told reporters on a call Sunday. \"It is not surprising to us that the Chinese are interested in this particular domain and are spending and investing heavily.\"\u00a0 But as the U.S. confronts that heavy spending on AI in China, the order does not introduce any new funding for AI research. An administration official told reporters that's because it's the responsibility of Congress to appropriate funds. The order\u00a0does direct\u00a0federal agencies to prioritize AI research in their budgeting and also better track their spending on AI, which is not a category that is typically earmarked today.\u00a0 The order will also direct agencies to make data that could enable AI more available to researchers, and it aims to set AI governance standards within federal agencies to mainatain a \"safe and trustworthy\" introduction of new AI technologies, especially as there are privacy concerns about government using AI tools.\u00a0 BYTES: Amazon is reconsidering whether to open part\u00a0of its second headquarters in\u00a0New York City amid mounting opposition from activists and several politicians including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), The Post's\u00a0Robert McCartney, Jonathan O'Connell and Patricia Sullivan\u00a0reported, citing two people familiar with Amazon's thinking. Although\u00a0Amazon executives have explored possible alternatives, the company\u00a0hasn't drawn any specific plan to abandon the New York project\u00a0that is set to bring 25,000 jobs on a new campus in\u00a0Long Island City, which is part of Queens. The New York state Senate has nominated an opponent of the project, Sen. Michael N. Gianaris (D-Queens), to a state board where he could potentially veto\u00a0the deal for Amazon's New York campus\u00a0\u2014 the state's final approval is not excepted before next year.\u00a0\u201cThe question is whether it\u2019s worth it if the politicians in New York don\u2019t want the project, especially with how people in Virginia and Nashville have been so welcoming,\u201d a person familiar with Amazon\u2019s thinking told my colleagues. Amazon plans to open the other half of its second headquarters in Crystal City in\u00a0Virginia and a smaller operation in Nashville.

Lawmakers still split on border wall talks: What Trump has said about E-Verify:","92":"In their first month in charge, House Democrats have flipped the adage from a Democratic favorite, the late Mario Cuomo. They campaigned in prose and are governing in poetry. Throughout 2018, Democrats tried to be boring. Their candidates followed instructions from Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), then the minority leader, to avoid confrontations with President Trump. She urged them to focus on kitchen-table issues, such as the high cost of prescription drugs, and to never take the bait on Trump\u2019s favorite issue, the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The midterm elections validated that approach with a 40-seat gain and a return to the majority. But in the past month, since Pelosi formally reclaimed the speaker\u2019s gavel, House Democrats have dived deep into hand-to-hand combat with Trump. They fought on his turf, immigration, and refused to reopen portions of the government until he gave up on his demand for $5.7 billion in border wall funds. Pelosi tussled with Trump, undermined his manhood and postponed his State of the Union address. Meanwhile, the Democratic pocketbook agenda took a back seat. Yet the high-risk strategy paid off Friday when Trump bowed to political reality, signing legislation to reopen federal agencies with no guarantee of wall funding. And Democrats admit this was never the plan, but they scored a bigger early victory than they ever imagined possible. \u201cWho would plan for a shutdown? I don\u2019t know that anybody can plan much with what I would call a reckless and feckless president,\u201d House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) said Thursday, a day before Trump folded. Even Pelosi acknowledged Democrats lost some focus on plans to lower health-care costs and produce an infrastructure plan. \u201cWe are working on these initiatives. We hope that we can open the government so that we can fully concentrate in this way,\u201d she told reporters at her weekly Thursday briefing. Twelve years ago, when she first became speaker, Pelosi shepherded a rapid-fire succession of legislation through the House. Six bills, making up the \u201cSix for \u201906\u201d platform that helped Democrats win the majority in the 2006 midterms, passed in less than 100 hours of floor time. Almost a month into this new majority, Democrats have not yet finished passing each piece of their first major bill, H.R. 1, an ethics and campaign finance proposal. Aside from legislation to reopen the government, the House accomplishment list is pretty meager so far: condemning white supremacy after controversial comments from Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), trying to block withdrawal from NATO and forbid lifting sanctions on a Russian oligarch, and directing House counsel to defend the Affordable Care Act in federal lawsuits. Liberal activists expecting the House Judiciary Committee to come roaring out of the gate with Trump hearings will have to wait a bit. The new chairman, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), convened the panel\u2019s organizational meeting Thursday. Their first hearing will not come until Feb. 8, with acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker. Some committees did not receive their full slot of new members until late this past week. The shutdown did not cause all the delays. After the November elections, Pelosi first had to tamp down a rebellion from a couple dozen Democrats calling for new leadership, leaving minor suspense around the Jan. 3 speaker vote on the House floor. Only after she won did Democrats convene their steering panel to begin doling out assignments, starting with the most important committees and methodically working downward. This left committees not formally empaneled, unable to begin work on those 2018 agenda items. \u201cWe\u2019ll get there in due course but that\u2019s not the priority right now,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cGetting this government reopened is the priority.\u201d Some Democratic leaders worried how their class of more than 60 freshmen would handle the shutdown. Their campaigns had focused on getting results for voters, and here was a Trump-Pelosi standoff leaving some critical agencies dysfunctional as little to no negotiations occurred. But Trump and his lieutenants struggled with their messaging. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told an interviewer Thursday that he could not understand why furloughed workers had to go to food banks. \u201cFrankly, the shutdown is bringing out the issues that we campaigned on, which is Democrats, now in the majority, being the party of the people, the party of the worker,\u201d Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Mich.), who won a GOP seat outside Detroit, said in an interview Thursday off the House floor. \u201cWe\u2019re connected to middle-class America.\u201d Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), representing hundreds of thousands of Northern Virginia residents impacted by the shutdown, said that polling showing Trump was being blamed by wide margins provided the political backbone to know they could win. Even if it meant getting into a mud fight with the king of mud fights. In recent weeks, Pelosi called Trump\u2019s demand for the wall \u201ca manhood thing\u201d and accused the real estate heir of thinking unpaid federal workers could \u201cask their father for more money.\u201d This was everything Democrats tried to avoid last year. Over and over, Pelosi steered her charges away from engaging Trump, particularly on anything related to the highly charged immigration issue. Two weeks before the election, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) condemned Trump for trying to inflame voters with unfounded accusations that an asylum-seeking caravan in Mexico was filled with criminals. \u201cThe president is desperate to change the subject from health care to immigration,\u201d Pelosi and Schumer wrote. Pelosi mostly stuck to that script right through her valedictory address four weeks ago on the first day of the new Congress. She never mentioned Trump\u2019s name. Instead, she promised \u201ca Congress that delivers results for the people\u201dand called on lawmakers to be \u201cpioneers of the future.\u201d Later that day, she formally invited Trump to deliver the annual presidential address in the House. Within days, the script got torn up, Pelosi and Trump started slugging it out, and agenda planning went to meeting rooms in the Capitol basement or in office buildings across the street. Now, with a clear victory on Trump\u2019s signature issue, Democrats enter the next round of fights believing they are on higher ground. Stevens, the Michigan freshman, struggled to find her way around the Capitol on Thursday to find a meeting about the agenda. On Wednesday, she huddled with Democrats about education and infrastructure proposals. She plans to use the shutdown as a vehicle to explain to her constituents how Democrats care about their needs. \u201cI\u2019m happy to have that conversation,\u201d Stevens said.

Pell, the most senior Catholic to be convicted of child sex abuse, was sentenced Wednesday to six years in prison for molesting two choirboys in a Melbourne, Australia, cathedral more than 20 years ago. He was convicted by a unanimous jury verdict of orally raping a 13-year-old choirboy and indecently dealing with the boy and the boy\u2019s 13-year-old friend in the late 1990s, months after becoming archbishop of Melbourne. Pell was appointed Archbishop of Sydney in 2001, and Pope John Paul II made him a cardinal in 2003.

Francis removed Pell as a member of his informal Cabinet in October, shortly before he was convicted of the abuse.

(Manuel Balce Ceneta\/AP) The Trump administration is eagerly touting some progress in combating the nation\u2019s epidemic of drug abuse\u00a0on the heels of recent findings that its drug control office is falling down on the job. Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway and other White House officials held a press call yesterday to argue there are concrete results from significant steps taken by the administration and Congress in the year since President Trump laid out his plan to combat the opioid epidemic. \"In President Trump's first year in office, overdose deaths grew by 10 percent, having grown by 22 percent the year before,\" Conway told reporters. \"So the rate of death increased at a rate less than half of what had increased just the year before.\" Conway pointed to a sharp decline in prescriptions for opioid painkillers, stepped-up government efforts to reduce the flow of illegal fentanyl and increased availability of treatment beds through Medicaid waivers, per my colleague Lenny Bernstein, who was on the call. She also said 58 percent of young Americans and 1.4 billion viewers have seen ads highlighting the dangers of opioids. Officials also pointed to bills enacted by Congress to help children born addicted to opioids and beef up screening of mail coming into the country from abroad for illegal fentanyl. Most notably, lawmakers in October passed, and Trump signed, the wide-ranging SUPPORT Act that includes\u00a0measures to curb the worst drug epidemic in U.S. history \u2014 although critics said it was too little, too late and lacked a large infusion of new federal dollars for treatment. Conway, who coordinates the White House\u2019s anti-drug efforts, said the administration would \u201ccontinue to focus on implementing\u201d the law, which she called \u201cthe single most comprehensive piece of legislation on any one drug crisis in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d Yet there\u2019s little evidence that the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy \u2014\u00a0whose leaders have said they meet regularly with Conway \u2014\u00a0has done much on its own to combat the crisis. In a report issued earlier this month, the Government Accountability Office said ONDCP didn\u2019t lay out specific, measurable objectives in the strategic plan it released in January. In a House Oversight panel hearing on the same day, ONDCP's acting director, Jim Carroll, faced scathing questions about that GAO finding, reports of turnover within the office, and its apparent failure to implement several dozen recommendations from the president\u2019s opioids commission. Family and friends who have lost loved ones to OxyContin and opioid overdoses leave pill bottles in protest outside the headquarters of Purdue Pharma. (Jessica Hill\/AP) Furthermore, it\u2019s difficult to distinguish whether progress in combating addiction can be largely\u00a0credited to the Trump administration's\u00a0actions over the past year or from efforts that began before the president announced his\u00a0efforts. And provisional CDC data through August 2018 shows that the number of overdose deaths from all drugs remains stubbornly high. The 2018 total is likely to be close to the record of 70,237 set in 2017. But the administration is right in noting there are a few bright spots in the fight\u00a0against opioid abuse. For example, the number of opioid prescriptions has been falling since their\u00a0peak of more than 255 million in 2012, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sharpest one-year decline in that period was in 2017, when the number of prescriptions dropped from 214.8 million in 2016 to 191.2 million. Conway said 17 states have applied for waivers that allow Medicaid to fund more beds for opioid treatment in hospitals, and the administration continually encourages others to seek the same authority. Distribution of the overdose antidote naloxone\u00a0also has increased sharply in the past year, she said. Still only a small portion of the more than 2 million Americans with an opioid-use disorder receive the medically assisted treatment \u2014\u00a0methadone, buprenorphine and other drugs \u2014that offer them the best chance of recovery.

The drug needs to be administered intravenously for 60 continuous hours, and the manufacturer, Sage Therapeutics, said it would probably cost $20,000 to $35,000 for a course of treatment,\u00a0as our colleagues Laurie McGinley and Lenny Bernstein report.\u00a0The drug will have to be administered under the supervision of a health-care professional in a physician\u2019s office or clinic and under an FDA safety program linked to the approval. The disorder, which affects an estimated 400,000 women nationwide each year, is characterized by feelings of guilt, worthlessness or thoughts of suicide, and can impact a mother\u2019s ability to bond with her child. The newly approved medication, called brexanolone, will be marketed under the name Zulresso. Currently, women suffering from postpartum depression are treated with antidepressants and psychotherapy, which can take one to two months to take effect and may have only a small-to-moderate impact. Comparatively, the new treatment works quickly and lasts at least 30 days, based on clinical studies. Family and friends who have lost loved ones to OxyContin and opioid overdoses protest outside Purdue Pharma headquarters in Stamford, Conn.\u00a0 (Jessica Hill\/AP) OOF: The National Portrait Gallery in London has given up a donation from the prominent Sackler family, which\u00a0owns Purdue Pharma and has become increasingly linked to the ongoing opioid crisis in the United\u00a0 States. It\u2019s the first major art institution to make such a move, The Guardian\u2019s Nadeem Badshah and Joanna Walters report. A gallery spokesman\u00a0told the publication that it \u201cjointly agreed\u201d with the family's organization not to move forward with the 1-million-pound, or about $1.3 million, donation. Our Post colleague Peggy McGlone reported last month about numerous cultural institutions\u00a0dealing with backlash surrounding\u00a0funding from the family that has, for more than five decades, donated to museums around the world. \u201cWith some leading members of the Sackler family facing a growing number of lawsuits over their alleged role in the deadly US opioid crisis, the family \u2014 which vigorously denies the allegations \u2014\u00a0claimed the donation to the gallery\u2019s Inspiring People project had been dropped to avoid creating a \u2018distraction\u2019 for the gallery,\u201d Nadeem and Joanna write. \u201cBut while both parties insisted that the decision was mutual, it will be seen as a major blow to the family\u2019s status as leading philanthropists and evidence that a campaign against the Sacklers\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. has been effective.\u201d (iStock). OUCH: In 2015, New York passed one of the strongest laws in the nation to prevent surprise medical bills, and it\u2019s now at the center of national attention from lawmakers and health-policy experts who are zeroing in on the issue, Vox\u2019s Sarah Kliff reports. \u201cLast year, New Jersey passed a law modeled on New York\u2019s, and Congress is now eying the New York law as a promising base for national legislation,\u201d she writes. The law uses a unique process of arbitration, a negotiation process forcing\u00a0doctors and insurers to negotiate a price on a service, which is determined with the help of a neutral arbiter. The process can \u201cforce insurers and doctors to make honest guesses about what the price should be.\u201d Sarah detailed the experience of Claudia Knafo, a New Yorker and professional piano player who helped push for the bill after she was hit with a surprise $101,000 charge for a spinal surgery. \u201cNew York\u2019s law passed in 2015. It had the support of the emergency room doctors and the insurance plans, two lobbies that often find themselves at loggerheads in these type of debates,\u201d Sarah writes. \u201cNow when a New York doctor thinks a health plan has underpaid, this law will often prevent the doctor from turning to the patient for the additional money in the way Knafo\u2019s surgeon did. Under the baseball-style arbitration law, the doctor can go to the state and request an arbitration process. The state will bring in a neutral arbiter to pick one of two prices: what the doctor is charging or what the insurer is paying.\u201d Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar. (Alex Wong\/Getty Images) \u2014 Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar backed needle exchange during remarks at the National HIV Prevention Conference, saying it could help bring down the rate of new HIV infections for drug users. Azar acknowledged such support is a shift for a Republican administration, The Hill\u2019s Jessie Hellmann reports. \u201cSyringe services programs aren\u2019t necessarily the first thing that comes to mind when you think about a Republican Health secretary, but we\u2019re in a battle between sickness and health, between life and death,\u201d Azar said during his speech. \u201cThe public health evidence for targeted interventions here is strong, and supporting communities when they need to use these tools means fewer infections and healthier lives for our fellow Americans.\u201d But Azar added the administration is still opposed to safe injection sites, facilities that give drug users a space to use illicit drugs with clean instruments and under the supervision of trained health-care workers. He said such sites \u201craise entirely different legal concerns.\u201d \u2014 Outgoing FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb suggested the agency could remove pod-based nicotine products from the market temporarily as it continues efforts to try to curb youth vaping. At a Brookings Institution event in Washington, Gottlieb explained he had recently had a \u201cdifficult\u201d meeting with representatives of e-cigarette maker Juul Labs and Marlboro maker Altria Group, which has a nearly $13 billion stake in Juul, as Bloomberg\u2019s Anna Edney reports. Anna conducted the interview at the Brookings event. Gottlieb said his agency is \u201cis going to have to very carefully calculate its action against the entire category of pod-based products.\u201d \u201cAll the dramatic gains we\u2019ve made reducing smoking in this country, particularly among youth, will be reversed by these products,\u201d he added. \u201cThe FDA is concerned that Altria\u2019s decision to take a $12.8 billion stake in Juul contradicts commitments both companies previously made to address what health officials have called an epidemic of youth vaping,\u201d Anna reports. \u201cBoth companies have said their devices are intended for adults who are trying to quit smoking traditional cigarettes.\u201d \u201cI continue to have concerns that some of the activities they\u2019re taking in the market are not necessarily consistent with what they are telling us, but certainly not consistent with what we think the broader public health objectives should be,\u201d Gottlieb said at the event.

That\u00a0decision in August came soon after the German pharmaceutical giant completed its acquisition of Monsanto. This first phase of the trial focused on whether the company\u2019s weedkiller and active ingredient glyphosate causes cancer. Now, the jury will hear evidence and separately determine whether Bayer\u2019s Monsanto division is liable. \u201cBayer faces lawsuits in the U.S. from about 11,200 farmers, home gardeners and landscapers claiming its glyphosate-based herbicides cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other cancers,\u201d Sara and Ruth write. \u201cBayer said Tuesday that it is disappointed with the jury\u2019s decision but \u2018we continue to believe firmly that the science confirms that glyphosate-based herbicides do not cause cancer\u2019 and that the second phase of the trial \u201cwill show that Monsanto\u2019s conduct has been appropriate.\u2019\u201d","96":"WAITANGI, New Zealand \u2014 To many visitors to New Zealand, an excursion to Waitangi and its stunning surroundings is considered a must. The country\u2019s founding document was signed here in 1840, and a museum on the historic grounds draws 100,000 visitors a year. Its history may have turned Waitangi into one of the country\u2019s premier attractions, but its presence in travel guides has come at a cost. Only about 2,000 inhabitants live in the area, which also includes the nearby town of Paihia. At least once a year, during the national Waitangi bank holiday this Wednesday, more than 15 times as many domestic and foreign visitors will flock to the town. For years, residents living near New Zealand\u2019s top tourist attractions warned that the rising numbers of tourists were catching many towns or nature reserves largely unprepared. Now, the government has come up with a plan: a one-time tourist tax of about $25, which is due to be introduced later this year and will help finance new infrastructure projects and environmental preservation efforts. It\u2019s an approach that is gaining momentum elsewhere, too, as more countries and cities face growing tourism numbers. Between 2017 and 2018, global tourism arrivals increased by 6.8 percent, to 1.3 billion in total. Back in 2000, it was half that number. While the vast majority of cities and countries around the world still wish for more visitors, a small minority of the world\u2019s favorites are increasingly viewing them as a burden. Amsterdam, for instance, has struggled to come to terms with becoming a European party hub. It hiked its overnight room taxes from 6 to 7 percent late last year to balance out the growing costs of its new reputation. Similarly popular Barcelona recently saw anti-tourism protests by locals who instead demanded a higher refugee intake. Local officials there and in other major cities such as Paris and Berlin responded in recent years to those concerns by increasing room taxes for tourists, too \u2014 including for Airbnb and other online platforms. Scotland\u2019s Edinburgh is currently pondering whether it should follow suit. Outside Europe, authorities on the Indonesian island of Bali are having similar thoughts. Venice became the latest major city with specific plans for such taxes on Monday. Officials there said that a single-day entry fee to the historic center of about $3.40 per person may take effect as early as May, with plans to gradually increase the tax to up to $11 in coming years. \u201cWe have to tell the whole world how difficult it is to administer such a special place,\u201d Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said Monday. To Venice\u2019s local leadership, collecting an entry fee into a city avoids the detour via the national government in Rome, which would have to collect such taxes nationally and then distribute them locally. Whether New Zealand\u2019s national approach could even work in Europe remains questionable, anyway. Within much of the continent, national tourism taxes would make little sense because they would not apply to most visitors from within the European Union. Europe\u2019s borderless Schengen Zone ensures E.U. residents can travel between countries without restrictions, but the treaty says nothing about cities, which is why Venice and other tourist hot spots are taking matters into their own hands. Iceland, which is also located within the Schengen Zone, pondered introducing a New Zealand- or Venice-style tax two years ago, which would probably have mainly hit non-E.U. tourists. But after its devastating banking crisis in 2008, the country still depends heavily on tourism. Afraid of halting a trend that has seen visitor numbers quadruple since 2008, officials recently traveled to New Zealand to gather alternative ideas. Overnight room taxes, which are common across Europe, offer one revenue stream. In Iceland and New Zealand, authorities are now experimenting with the next step: how to spend the money. The obvious way is to improve the infrastructure, including widening roads, improving utilities and expanding hospitals to accommodate the increasing flow of people. One of their most pressing issues, both officials in Iceland and in New Zealand complain, is that online recommendations have turned insider tips into must-do bucket-list attractions. While Instagram shots take minutes to gain traction online, local infrastructure improvements can take years or decades. Educating tourists on how to behave or advertising alternative destinations could be an easy intermediate solution. But in a city like Venice, which floods at least once a year and is on almost every Europe traveler\u2019s mind, there\u2019s a limit to how much that infrastructure can still be improved. Besides its new planned tax, authorities there have found another solution: Whenever things become too messy, pedestrian gates around the historic center simply shut down \u2014 no matter how much you\u2019re willing to pay to get in.

(Carlo Allegri\/Reuters) There\u2019s no doubt members of Congress will aggressively grill pharmaceutical executives in today\u2019s landmark hearing on spiking drug prices in the United States. What will be\u00a0fascinating is how the drugmakers try to defend actions that many have called indefensible. \u201cThere is no story I think they can tell that would justify the price increases they\u2019ve been doing,\u201d said Gerard Anderson, professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University, who advised the Senate Finance Committee as its leaders organized the hearing. The seven executives on the panel \u2014 from Sanofi, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, AbbVie, Merck and Janssen (owned by Johnson & Johnson) \u2014 will probably recite common industry arguments. They\u2019ll point to the costs of research and development. They\u2019ll argue companies don\u2019t pocket all of a drug\u2019s list price because of\u00a0rebates they return to pharmacy middlemen. They\u2019ll blame these pharmacy benefit managers and insurers for not doing more to shelter customers from out-of-pocket costs. \u201cOn average, 40 percent of the list price of medicines is given as rebates or discounts to other entities in the supply chain,\u201d Holly Campbell, deputy vice president for public affairs at Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, wrote in an email to reporters yesterday. \u201cHealth insurers are shifting more costs onto patients through deductibles, increased use of coinsurance and the use of four or more tiers for prescription medicines.\u201d But it\u2019s one thing for the industry to defend large price tags attached to entirely new \u201cbreakthrough\u201d drugs, which cost companies many hundreds of millions of dollars to bring to market. It\u2019s another to defend seemingly arbitrary price hikes on drugs used for decades with little or no improvements to how these medicines work. Senators will probably\u00a0focus on these longstanding,\u00a0widely used drugs in their queries to the witnesses. Expect lots of questions about insulin, which is used by 7.4 million Americans with diabetes. Between 2001 and 2015, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi increased prices for their insulins Humalog, Novolog and Lantus by 585 percent, 87 percent and 77 percent, respectively. Director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and\u00a0Prescribing\u00a0at the\u00a0University of Pittsburgh: Prices for insulin and other injectable drugs have risen even faster than\u00a0for oral medicines. The costs of oral drugs increased 9.2 percent from 2008 to 2016 while the costs of injectable drugs grew 15.1 percent during the same time period, according to a study published last month in the journal Health Affairs. That same study found that decisions by the makers of brand-name drugs to raise prices are the primary reason for the increase in U.S. drug prices, not the\u00a0expensive new therapies or improvements in existing medications. For critics of the industry, the answer is simple: Drugmakers raise prices because there\u2019s no one stopping them. \u201cIt was the little drug companies that had one or two drugs,\u00a0and they raised the price dramatically,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThe investment bankers said to Pfizer, \u2018Well, if they can do it, why can\u2019t you?\u2019 \u201d Other players along the drug supply chain will be watching with delight today as the pharmaceutical industry gets its turn under the harsh Hill spotlight. They\u2019re not exactly getting a free pass \u2014 recall that last month the Trump administration angered pharmacy benefit managers (known as PBMs)\u00a0by proposing\u00a0to ban the rebates they get from drug companies \u2014 but for now, they\u2019re happy to be sitting on the sidelines. \u201cI think it will be really important for the CEO of Sanofi to explain what happened with insulin prices over the past decade,\u201d said Matt Eyles, president of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans. \u201cWhat is so fundamentally different today that enabled that price increase to transpire \u2014 I don\u2019t know that any of us have heard a great explanation from the industry as to why that happened.\u201d Shawn Martin, senior vice president for advocacy at the American Academy of Family Physicians, said he\u2019s also watching for drugmakers to be forced to explain massive cost spikes for drugs that were approved by the Food and Drug Administration decades ago. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the blockbuster or the orphan drugs for rare diseases,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt\u2019s the products that have three-, four-, five-decade life spans that have seen significant increases in costs.\u201d There\u2019s nothing the rest of the health-care industry \u2014 insurers, PBMs and providers \u2014 would like more than for drugmakers to be cornered on the issue of high list prices. List prices aren\u2019t typically the final prices paid by pharmacies and insurers to sell and cover a drug\u00a0when the complicated system of rebates and discounts is taken into account.\u00a0But players all along the supply chain have been blamed for creating the whole complicated system that allows drugmakers to push list prices ever higher. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see a lot of magician tricks to get away from the fact that they set the list price,\u201d said Erik Rasmussen, vice president of government affairs for the American Hospital Association. AHH: Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced he will file a lawsuit against the Trump administration's latest rule targeting groups like\u00a0Planned Parenthood.\u00a0 It\u2019s the first lawsuit in what is sure to be a slew of legal challenges from Democratic-led states over the final rule issued Friday by the administration to bar groups getting federal family planning funding from providing abortions or abortion referrals. The National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association announced a separate lawsuit yesterday over the same issue. The Washington state Democratic attorney general called the rule a \"transparent attack on Planned Parenthood\" and charged\u00a0it could limit access to medical care for low-income women in certain regions.\u00a0\u201cRural communities currently have a shortage of health care providers,\u201d Ferguson said\u00a0at a news conference \u201cThis rule will make the shortage even more acute.\u201d Ferguson said he would file the suit as soon as the rule is published to the federal register, the Seattle Times\u2019s David Gutman reports. \u201cWe will not allow the federal government to dictate what a provider can or cannot say to a patient,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThis case is about placing a political ideology, about placing politicians in the room\u00a0when doctors and patients are discussing health-care options. That is unacceptable.\u201d Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. (Toya Sarno Jordan\/Bloomberg News\/Getty Images) OOF: The Food and Drug Administration wants to take a closer look at whether prescription opioids are actually effective in alleviating chronic pain and will now require drugmakers to study their\u00a0effectiveness. There\u2019s little current conclusive and controlled research on opioid effectiveness, our\u00a0Post colleagues Lenny Bernstein and Laurie McGinley report. They write some studies suggest opioids can be ineffective for treating pain after 12 weeks, and experts warn about the risks of addiction with long-term use. \u201cWe are going to impose a mandate on existing products .\u2009.\u2009. to answer the question that people have been posing for years: whether you have declining efficacy, and whether that declining efficacy can lead to addiction,\u201d Gottlieb told our colleagues. \u201cThe FDA acquired the authority to demand the effectiveness research in a section of the Support for Patients and Communities Act, passed in October,\u201d Lenny and Laurie write. \u201cPreviously, Gottlieb said, the FDA could order only safety studies of drugs on the market, but the new power allows for effectiveness studies as well.\u201d But one longtime critic panned the move, saying the FDA has the research it needs to act.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what the FDA said to us in 2013,\u201d Andrew Kolodny, director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, told our colleagues. \"Five years later, we don\u2019t have the studies,\u00a0and another FDA commissioner says, \u2018We\u2019re going to do the studies.\u2019 \u201d OUCH: Vaccine critics are facing a backlash amid the resurgence of a measles outbreak across the nation. It's coming from lawmakers in the District of Columbia\u00a0who are investigating vaccine misinformation and the recent outbreaks, holding bipartisan hearings in the House and the Senate this week. It\u2019s also coming from the states, where lawmakers are introducing measures to make it more difficult for parents to avoid vaccinating their children, our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports. In\u00a0Washington state, even amid\u00a0some anti-vaccination sentiment there, two measures are moving with bipartisan support through the legislature to prohibit parents from using personal or philosophical exemptions to avoid immunizing their school-age children. \u201cIn Arizona, Iowa and Minnesota, lawmakers have for the first time introduced similar measures,\u201d Lena writes. \u201cIn Vermont, legislators are trying to do away with the state\u2019s religious exemption four years after eliminating the philosophical exemption. In New Jersey, where lawmakers have sought unsuccessfully to tighten religious exemptions, a bill to repeal it entirely was recently amended on the General Assembly floor.\u201d \u201c[T]here is a growing consensus for state authorities to make the bold move to require all children to be vaccinated, with the only exception being those who cannot be given the vaccine for medical reasons,\u201d Diane Peterson, of the Minnesota nonprofit Immunization Action Coalition, told Lena. \u2014 The Senate fell short of the votes needed to advance a bill to punish physicians who don\u2019t provide medical care to children born alive after an attempted abortion. In a final vote of 53 in favor and 44 opposed, all but three Democrats voted against a procedural motion on\u00a0the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, our Post colleagues Mike DeBonis and Felicia Sonmez report. The bill needed 60 votes to advance. The bill, written\u00a0by Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), sought to require doctors to \u201cexercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child\u201d as they would to \u201cany other child born alive at the same gestational age.\u201d \u201cI want to ask each and every one of my colleagues whether or not we\u2019re okay with infanticide,\u201d Sasse said on the Senate floor yesterday. \u201cAre we a country that protects babies that are alive, born outside the womb after having survived a botched abortion?\u201d Republicans tried to advance the measure after Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) defended a failed\u00a0bill that sought to loosen restrictions on\u00a0abortions late in pregnancy and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) signed a new law decriminalizing the death of a fetus if a pregnant woman is assaulted and making it easier to obtain a late-term abortion. Abortion rights supporters argued Sasse\u2019s bill is meant to \u201cdissuade doctors from performing late-term abortions in the first place.\u201d \u201cWe must call out today\u2019s vote for what it is: a direct attack on women\u2019s health and rights,\u201d Leana Wen, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. \u201cThis legislation is based on lies and a misinformation campaign, aimed at shaming women and criminalizing doctors for a practice that doesn\u2019t exist in medicine or reality.\u201d Republicans charged that by opposing\u00a0the bill, Democrats were implicitly condoning\u00a0 that infants born alive after attempted abortions shouldn't get medical care. This kind of procedure is relatively rare, however, and the GOP-led vote was\u00a0a political move designed to get Democrats on the record.

This week, House Democrats\u00a0are set to pass a bipartisan bill requiring federal background checks on all gun sales, Politico\u2019s John Bresnahan reports. They\u2019ve also scheduled a vote on a measure to\u00a0extend the federal background check deadline from three to 20 business days, which John writes is meant to \u201cclose the \u2018Charleston Loophole,\u2019 which allowed white supremacist Dylann Roof, who killed nine African-Americans at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, to buy a gun despite pending felony drug charges against him.\u201d The fates of these bills in the Republican-controlled Senate is questionable, and both the National Rifle Association and President Trump himself oppose them. But the quick movement on the legislation is notable following Democrats' campaign promises and victory in retaking control of the House, John writes. Still, divide remains. Just five House Republicans have backed the universal background checks bill.\u00a0 House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), who was injured in a shooting at a congressional baseball game in June 2017, is one of the lawwmakers against the bill. \u2014 Meanwhile in New York, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) attended the signing of a bill that will prevent people from buying or possessing firearms if they show signs of being a threat to themselves or others. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) signed the bill after the state legislature easily passed the measure last month. The Red Flag Bill is the first such measure in the nation to authorize family members, teachers and school officials\u00a0to seek court intervention to stop someone from possessing or owning a gun. \"Today New York is proud to pass the first-in-the-nation Red Flag Bill that empowers school teachers to do something when they believe something bad is going to happen,\u201d Cuomo said at the signing. \u201cWe are empowering teachers, not by giving them guns, like the president wants,\u00a0but by arming and empowering them with the law, so when a teacher or family member sees there is a problem, they can go to a judge and get a court-ordered evaluation.\u201d (iStock) \u2014 An overwhelming majority of American voters want Congress to address health-care costs, according to a new poll published by Morning Consult.

Members of the House Economic Development Legislative subcommittee voted Tuesday in favor of the Professional Sports Team Investment Act. The proposal would allow the NFL team to be eligible for tax credits and exemptions, incentives they would not have been eligible for under current laws. A Senate subcommittee passed their companion version of the bill Tuesday. The bill\u2019s author, House Majority Leader Gary Simrill, said the legislation is intended for all prospective professional teams to consider the Palmetto State as a viable location for their franchise. \u201cIt allows South Carolina to welcome pro sports teams to South Carolina, giving them basically what is afforded to other businesses when they bring investments to South Carolina, jobs to South Carolina,\u201d the Republican lawmaker said. \u201cThis just adds that to the list.\u201d The legislation comes after talks last week between South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, lawmakers and Panthers owner David Tepper.

Edward J. Markey\u00a0\u00a0(D-Mass.) hold a news conference on\u00a0the\u00a0Green New Deal\u00a0in February. (Reuters\/Jonathan Ernst) President Trump said\u00a0the Green New Deal will cost $100 trillion. But the Democratic authors of the sweeping climate change effort that also includes significant changes to the social safety net didn't estimate how much such an effort would cost American taxpayers. In fact, the president's $100 trillion figures\u00a0seems to have originated from one conservative's back-of-the-envelope calculations on Twitter. Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who is formerly an economist for the Senate Finance Committee and an adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s and Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaigns, said he has not been in contact with the White House about the math that gave rise to the exorbitant price tag. \u201cMaybe my tweet had more influence than I thought,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. But Trump's adoption of the $100 trillion figure -- as well as estimates\u00a0cited by other Republican policymakers -- shows the speed by which information\u00a0has\u00a0ricocheted around the conservative blogosphere as opponents\u00a0have made the Green New Deal a persistent punching bag in their rhetoric before any substantial policy discussions have occurred in Congress. \"They want to take away your car, reduce the value of your home, and put millions of Americans out of work, spend $100 trillion, which, by the way, there's no such thing as $100 trillion,\" Trump told rally-goers in El Paso, Tex. \"You have to spend $100 trillion.\" Apparently pleased with that line, Trump repeated the 12-digit figure during his keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland when attacking Democrats' \"new $100 trillion Green New Deal.\" According to conservatives, sometimes the total cost of the Green New Deal introduced last month by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0would be $93 trillion. Other times it is as high as $100 trillion, as Trump estimated last month. Shortly after the plan's release, Riedl estimated the plan's\u00a0cost\u00a0could run north of $100 trillion. And an official analysis from the American Action Forum implied to some conservatives a total cost of $93 trillion. In response, Democrats have dismissed those tallies as \u201cmisinformation\u201d funded by fossil-fuel interests, including the Kochs. Guaranteeing everyone a job could cost anywhere from $6.8 trillion to $44.6 trillion, the report said. A net-zero emissions transportation system would run from $1.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion. The report itself doesn't mention the number $93 trillion. But when the top of all the ranges of the report's six different categories are added together, that is the sum. With that, some Republicans suddenly had a figure to cite. \"At $93 trillion, the Green New Deal would cost more than the entire recorded spending of the U.S. since the Constitution went into effect in 1789,\" Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), for example, said last month on the Senate floor. Yet in the report itself, the authors concede is just \"an initial foray\" at estimating the actual cost of the Green New Deal. And doing that addition on the top ends of the ranges of the different categories \"doesn't convey the uncertainty,\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and former director of the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cIt took on a life of its own,\u201d he said in an interview. But what the think-tank report does do, Holtz-Eakin said, is express what he sees as the staggering order of magnitude of the cost of implementing the Democratic climate plan. \"Is it tens of millions of dollars, tens of billions of dollars or tens of trillions of dollars?\" he said. \"Clearly it's the latter.\" Yet given that math, PolitiFact rated the specific $93 trillion figure as \"false.\" Politico ended up dubbing it \"bogus.\" On Feb. 8, before the American Action Forum report came out,\u00a0Riedl tried tabulating the cost of the deal in a series of Twitter messages. He conceded he had \u201cNo idea\u201d how to determine the cost of some items, such as replacing gasoline-powered vehicles or making buildings more energy-efficient nationwide. But Riedl\u00a0said the total \u201cmust be heading towards $100 trillion.\u201d From there, that figure ricocheted around right-wing blogs like Townhall until Trump mentioned it in his Feb. 11 speech in Texas. But Dave Anderson, a policy and communications manager at the pro-renewables Energy and Policy Institute who has tracked the spread of that $100 trillion figure, said \u201cwe know that President Trump and his staff regularly watch the conservative media scene.\u201d Riedl added that while his impromptu\u00a0analysis is hardly \"a rock-solid score,\" it is still \"a fair ballpark estimate.\" \"Heading towards $100 trillion allows for a pretty broad range of figures,\" he added. Markey has criticized the numbers as \"misinformation\u201d meant to stymie climate-related legislation. \u201cIf the Republicans want to, they should set up a debate,\u201d Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.)\u00a0said\u00a0earlier this month on the Senate floor. \u201cAnd we can have it out here on whether or not the planet is dangerously warming, whether or not human activity is principally responsible and whether or not this body should take action.\u201d \u201cThat is what we should be debating out here this afternoon,\u201d he continued. \u201cNot a whole group of bogus facts produced by the Koch brothers, paid for by the Koch brothers, that are being repeated over and over again.\u201d The American Action Network, a sister organization of the American Action Forum that has funded it in the past, does not disclose its donors. But ProPublica has identified it has part of \"a tangle of nonprofits\" supported by the brothers \"all aimed at advancing conservative causes.\" The most costly supposed Green New Deal measure, according to both Riedl and American Action Forum, is providing \u00a0single-payer health care. But as a review of the American Action Forum report from\u00a0Markey\u2019s office points out, his resolution does not specifically call for that.\u00a0Its promise is more vague --\u00a0to\u00a0provide everyone with \u201chigh-quality health care.\u201d What\u2019s more, the American Action Forum analysis imagines the deal will seek to replace all commercial air travel with high-speed rail, which is again something not mentioned in the text of the resolution. Holtz-Eakin argues that to get to zero emissions in the transportation sector, the nation would indeed need to \u201cground the planes.\u201d Another, perhaps more important point of contention from\u00a0Markey: These are cost analyses, not cost-benefit analyses that take into account the jobs created or the health costs avoided by reducing fossil-fuel\u00a0emissions.

Cohen, who had been in a joint defense agreement with Trump, was squarely in investigators\u2019 crosshairs \u2014 with conflicting incentives for whether to keep secret what he knew about potential wrongdoing by the president. Cooperating with prosecutors might win their mercy, but doing so would not let Cohen avoid prison entirely. Sticking with the president might draw prosecutors\u2019 wrath, but Trump could reward him with a pardon. House and Senate investigators are keenly interested in discussions that took place in those tense months surrounding the raid. Cohen has privately claimed that a pardon was dangled to him by Trump\u2019s representatives, people familiar with the matter say \u2014 though he has been unspecific about the timing or substance of the talks. Two others familiar with the events said it was Stephen Ryan, Cohen\u2019s lawyer at the time, who raised the issue of a pardon. Within weeks of the raid, Ryan and Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, discussed the subject, people familiar with the matter said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a matter still being investigated. The Wall Street Journal first reported the conversation involving Giuliani. Ryan did not respond to requests for comment. Giuliani declined to say whether he had a conversation with Ryan or anyone else about a pardon for Cohen, but he said that throughout the investigations of Trump\u2019s campaign, the president has not considered pardons for Cohen or any former associate. \u201cI can\u2019t confirm or deny whether I had a conversation with any of the attorneys because it\u2019s attorney-client privilege, but what I can say is that I\u2019ve said the same thing to everyone, privately and publicly, which is that the president is not considering pardons at this time,\u201d Giuliani said. Giuliani added: \u201cThe president, as he has said, will not consider pardons during this time. It\u2019s not on his mind. He\u2019s not thinking about it. That doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have the legal authority to do it. But at this point, he\u2019s not thinking about it, and it\u2019s not on his mind.\u201d Although Trump has authority under the Constitution to pardon Cohen, doing so could be politically damaging. Lawmakers also are interested in exploring whether Cohen was offered a bargain tying his cooperation with law enforcement to a pardon \u2014 which could be illegal. In public testimony last week before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cohen asserted that federal prosecutors in Manhattan asked him not to discuss a conversation he had with the president or one of his agents after the FBI raided his home. It was not immediately clear, though, whether prosecutors\u2019 interest in the conversation is related to pardons. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office has declined to comment on Cohen\u2019s testimony. \u201cI do not believe that exercising the constitutional right alone can constitute obstruction,\u201d said Jacob Frenkel, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice at Dickinson Wright. \u201cOn the other hand, if the president were to bargain a pardon in exchange for any act that would obstruct the investigation, that would implicate the bribery and gratuities statute.\u201d Cohen told lawmakers that he had never asked for, nor would he accept, a pardon from Trump. If he were found to have sought a pardon, that could raise questions about the veracity of his testimony. Lanny J. Davis, a lawyer for Cohen, said, \u201cWe stand by the truth of Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony before the House Oversight Committee.\u201d Cohen ultimately left the joint defense agreement he had with Trump and pleaded guilty in August to several crimes, including violating campaign finance laws by arranging for the payment of hush money to women who alleged they had affairs with Trump. In his plea and in later court hearings, Cohen alleged that he worked in coordination with Trump to break the law. He also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the timing of discussions about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow, saying his aim was to be consistent with Trump\u2019s messaging on Russia. Cohen testified that the discussions ended in January 2016, when in fact, he now admits, they continued into June. A person familiar with the matter characterized the discussions about pardons involving Cohen \u2014 and Cohen\u2019s memory of them \u2014 as nebulous. Cohen has not alleged that he was offered an explicit quid pro quo that would tie a pardon to his cooperation with law enforcement, the person said. The person said Cohen felt that Trump\u2019s team was using innuendo and suggestion to imply there would be a benefit for his loyalty. \u201cIt was very vague,\u201d the person said. The topic of pardons came up when Cohen testified privately last week before the House and Senate Intelligence committees. Precisely what Cohen alleged there remains unclear. Davis has declined to discuss the closed-door session, though he said on MSNBC that Cohen discussed new, potentially \u201cgame-changing\u201d information and that it was about \u201clying and obstruction evidence.\u201d Cohen is scheduled to continue his closed-door testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday. The period after the April raid was particularly fraught for Cohen, who was feeling increasingly isolated from Trump and facing escalating legal and financial concerns. In June, a dispute erupted over his legal debts, which were being paid in part by the Trump Organization, people familiar with the matter said. The Trump Organization was not at the time paying for all of Cohen\u2019s expenses, but it was footing the bill for a costly review of the enormous cache of documents and audio and video recordings seized during the raid. The argument over legal bills burst into public when it was reported that Cohen would be parting from the Trump Organization\u2019s legal team, including Ryan, that had been representing him. At the time, Cohen told associates that he was feeling neglected by the president, despite his long-professed loyalty. The Washington Post reported in July 2017 that Trump had asked advisers about his power to pardon aides, family members and even himself in connection with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into whether his campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 election. In the wake of that report, Trump seemed to play down his consideration of that topic. \u201cWhile all agree the U.S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us,\u201d he wrote on Twitter at the time. Trump\u2019s other comments, though, have led his critics to worry he might offer pardons to those who remain loyal to him, while retaliating against those who don\u2019t. After Cohen pleaded guilty in August to various crimes and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors on the same day former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was found guilty after a weeks-long trial, Trump directly contrasted the two men and took a swipe at his own Justice Department, which handled their cases. \u201cI feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201c\u2009\u2018Justice\u2019 took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to \u2018break\u2019 \u2014 make up stories in order to get a \u2018deal.\u2019 Such respect for a brave man!\u201d A day later, The Post reported that Trump had recently asked his lawyers for advice on the possibility of pardoning Manafort.","101":"Why do so many American politicians, from state legislators and governors to members of Congress to presidents, express such passionate support for the State of Israel? Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) sparked a social media controversy Sunday night by asserting that the answer lies in campaign donations. Responding to a tweet by journalist Glenn Greenwald complaining about \u201chow much time US political leaders spend defending a foreign nation,\u201d Omar tweeted \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins, baby\u201d \u2014 a reference to a 1997 hit by rapper Puff Daddy. Challenged to explain by Batya Ungar-Sargon, opinion editor at Jewish publication the Forward, Omar answered \u201cAIPAC!\u201d Omar\u2019s tweet had similarities with classic anti-Semitism. Beliefs that Jews use wealth and control of the media to manipulate other nations dates to the Middle Ages and is a major theme of the infamous forgery \u201cThe Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\u201d In the United States, its prominent advocates included Henry Ford, who used his newspaper, the Dearborn Independent, to promote anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. It is not clear whether Omar intended to evoke these beliefs, although she did also claim in a 2012 tweet that \u201cIsrael has hypnotized the world.\u201d Intentions aside, her explanation of the so-called special relationship between the United States and the State of Israel is wrong. Much of Israel\u2019s influence is based on public support rather than elite attitudes. Furthermore, attitudes to Israel have been shaped far more fundamentally by internal debates among gentiles than the influence of Jewish organizations. Israel is popular with the U.S. public The most important reason public officials support Israel is that the public does. In fact, approval is at a 17-year high, with 74 percent of adults reporting a favorable opinion. Over time, that support has become increasingly concentrated among Republicans. However, majorities of Democrats and independents share their opinions. Public support for Israel is not a new phenomenon. Surveys conducted between 1947 and 1949 showed that nearly three times as many Americans sympathized with Jews over Arabs in the conflict in former Mandatory Palestine. No subsequent survey has ever found greater sympathy for Arabs or Palestinians than for the Jewish State. This popularity is rooted in part in debates among Christians American approval for Israel in the 20th\u00a0and 21st\u00a0centuries has deep historical roots in the Christian understanding of America. In my book, \u201cGod\u2019s Country: Christian Zionism in America,\u201d I show that leaders of Puritan New England predicted the demographic return and political revival of the Jewish people in the biblical promised land. For figures like John Cotton and Increase Mather, the inevitable \u201crestoration of the Jews\u201d was proof that God kept his covenants with chosen peoples, providing reason to expect the success of their own \u201cerrand into the wilderness.\u201d Puritan arguments about the restoration of Israel were based on Calvinist theology and \u201cJudeo-centric\u201d interpretations of biblical prophecy that were developed by English scholars in the early 17th\u00a0century. They were redeployed after the American Revolution, as Americans looked for precedents for a union of semi-independent communities under a single government. Combining prophetic hopes for Jewish restoration with republican political theory, ministers and scholars proposed that the biblical Hebrews were the best model for how a federally organized nation might work. It was possible to admire the \u201cHebrew republic\u201d as Thomas Paine did, without believing that the Jewish diaspora would return, or build a state. However, more theologically and politically conservative writers insisted that consolidation of the United States by the Constitution was a step toward the reestablishment of a Hebrew state in what Christians described as the Holy Land. \u201cWho knows but God has raised up these United States, in these latter days, for the very purpose of accomplishing his will in bringing his beloved people to their own land?\u201d asked Elias Boudinot, a former aide to Washington, member of the Continental Congress, and Federalist politician, in his 1814 book, \u201cThe Age of Revelation.\u201d American Christians expected that Jews would eventually convert to Christianity \u2014 a view Jews by definition reject. Yet 19th-century proto-Zionists like Boudinot argued that Jewish return would be accomplished through regular processes of international relations. In 1845, John Price Durbin, a Methodist who served as chaplain of the Senate and president of Dickinson College, insisted on \u201cthe undoubted fact of the restoration of a Jewish state in Palestine \u2026 by the operation of social and political causes\u201d rather than a miracle. Hopes for a political alliance between the United States and the people and land of Israel reached an early peak in 1891, when the evangelist William E. Blackstone presented a petition to President Benjamin Harrison calling for the establishment of a Jewish State in Ottoman Palestine. Four hundred thirteen \u201crepresentative\u201d Americans endorsed it, including Supreme Court Chief Justice Melville Fuller, future president William McKinley, titans of industry and finance like John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan, and the editors of dozens of major newspapers. Much has changed in the United States \u2014 and the Middle East \u2014 since 1891. But the list of signatories to the so-called Blackstone Memorial is not so different to the rolls of political, economic, and media luminaries who declare their support for Israel today. Nor is the favorable reception they receive in White House. Blackstone\u2019s meeting with Pres. Harrison was engineered by Harrison\u2019s own Secretary of State, James G. Blaine. History suggests that the United States\u2019 sustained and often enthusiastic support for Zionism and the State of Israel is not a product of Jewish influence. On the contrary, it is primarily the result of arguments and organization undertaken by, for, and among gentiles.

John Fry, an investigative analyst with the IRS in San Francisco, was charged with the unauthorized disclosure of suspicious-activity reports, or SARs. Such reports are meant to flag potentially unlawful financial conduct to government investigators but do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing. According to the court documents, unsealed in federal court in San Francisco, Fry is accused of sharing the reports\u2019 contents with Michael Avenatti, a lawyer who rose to national prominence representing adult-film actress Stormy Daniels in litigation arising from her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump more than a decade ago. Cohen pleaded guilty last year to arranging hush-money payments to Daniels and another woman who also alleged an affair with Trump. Fry\u2019s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Court records show he appeared briefly in court Thursday and was released on a $50,000 bond. Court records do not show whether a plea was entered. Avenatti, who made the information public by posting it on social media, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. He said on Twitter that he did nothing wrong. A lawyer for Cohen declined to comment. Fry\u2019s case is the second in recent months in which a government employee has been charged with disclosing suspicious-activity reports related to persons of interest in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation. Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. In October, the Justice Department charged a senior Treasury Department official with giving a journalist the details of SARs involving financial transactions connected to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and other associates of the president\u2019s. The new case cites reporting by The Washington Post and the New Yorker and alleges that Fry was the root source of information for those stories. Authorities say that on May 4, 2018, Fry used his access to a government database to look up five SARs on Cohen and called Avenatti \u201cimmediately after downloading\u201d the documents. A May 8 article published by The Post and based on information provided by Avenatti, traced the flows of money into and out of Essential Consultants, a limited-liability company Cohen used in part to arrange a hush-money payment for Daniels during the 2016 election campaign. That transaction led to Cohen\u2019s pleading guilty to the charge of violating campaign finance law. He also pleaded guilty to other crimes and is due to testify publicly to Congress next week before heading to prison in early March. Cohen is to appear for a private hearing Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee, his lawyer confirmed. He also is to provide public testimony Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee and then additional private testimony Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee. Four days after The Post\u2019s story was published in May, according to the criminal complaint, Fry allegedly placed a call to Ronan Farrow, a reporter for the New Yorker. Later that month, Farrow wrote a story about an unidentified law enforcement official who shared the SARs because he had grown alarmed after being unable to locate two such documents regarding Cohen in a government database. A New Yorker spokeswoman declined to comment. Within the Treasury Department, officials sometimes remove SARs related to high-profile or sensitive cases from the searchable databases to prevent officials without a direct role in particular cases from casually looking at the information, according to court documents. The criminal complaint alleges that Fry had no valid work-related reason to look at SARs involving Cohen. By conducting a search of Fry\u2019s phone, investigators obtained WhatsApp text messages between Fry and Farrow during the period in question, according to the criminal complaint. The charging document said that Fry confessed when confronted by federal agents in November. \u201cFry confessed to verbally providing SAR information to Avenatti. Fry also admitted that he sent Avenatti a screenshot of the narrative. Fry stated that Reporter-1 (Farrow) contacted him to verify the information supplied to Reporter-1 by Avenatti,\u201d the complaint said. After Fry was charged, Avenatti said on Twitter: \u201cNeither I nor R. Farrow did anything wrong or illegal with the financial info relating to Cohen\u2019s crimes... And if we did (we didn\u2019t), then every reporter in America would be jailed and unable to do their job.\u201d","103":"A record 7 million Americans are 90 days or more behind on their auto loan payments, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported Tuesday, even more than during the wake of the financial crisis. Economists warn that this is a red flag. Despite the strong economy and low unemployment rate, many Americans are struggling to pay their bills. \u201cThe substantial and growing number of distressed borrowers suggests that not all Americans have benefited from the strong labor market,\u201d economists at the New York Fed wrote in a blog post. A car loan is typically the first payment people make because a vehicle is critical to getting to work, and someone can live in a car if all else fails. When car loan delinquencies rise, it is usually a sign of significant duress among low-income and working-class Americans. \u201cYour car loan is your No. 1 priority in terms of payment,\u201d said Michael Taiano, a senior director at Fitch Ratings. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a car, you can\u2019t get back and forth to work in a lot of areas of the country. A car is usually a higher-priority payment than a home mortgage or rent.\u201d People who are three months or more behind on their car payments often lose their vehicle, making it even more difficult to get to work, the doctor\u2019s office or other critical places. The New York Fed said that there were over a million more \u201ctroubled borrowers\u201d at the end of 2018 than there were in 2010, when unemployment hit 10 percent and the auto loan delinquency rate peaked. Today, unemployment is 4 percent and job openings are at an all-time high, yet a significant number of people cannot pay their car loan. Most of the people who are behind on their bills have low credit scores and are under age 30, suggesting young people are having a difficult time paying for their cars and their student loans at the same time. Auto loans surged in the past several years as car sales skyrocketed, hitting a record high in 2016 of 17.5 million vehicles sold in the United States. Overall, many borrowers have strong credit scores and repay their loans on time, but defaults have been high among \u201csubprime\u201d borrowers with credit scores under 620 on an 850-point scale. The share of auto loan borrowers who were three months behind on their payments peaked at 5.3 percent in late 2010. The share is slightly lower now \u2014 4.5 percent \u2014 because the total number of borrowers has risen so much in the past several years. Still, economists are concerned because the number of people impacted is far greater now and the rate has been climbing steadily since 2016 even as more people found employment. Experts warn Americans to be careful where they get their auto loan. Traditional banks and credit unions have much smaller default rates than \u201cauto finance\u201d companies such as the \u201cbuy here, pay here\u201d places on some car lots. Fewer than 1 percent of auto loans issued by credit unions are 90 days or more late, compared with 6.5 percent of loans issued by auto finance companies. \u201cThe No. 1 piece of advice I have is to not get your financing from a car dealership,\u201d said Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah and former special adviser to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cShop separately for the vehicle and the financing. Go to a credit union or community bank to get a low-cost loan.\u201d Rates can vary substantially depending on a borrower\u2019s credit score and where they obtain a loan. A \u201cprime\u201d borrower with a credit score in the range of 661 to 780 can get an auto loan rate of about 4.5 to 6 percent, according to NerdWallet. In contrast, a subprime borrower is typically looking at rates between 14.5 and 20 percent. After the financial crisis, the government placed heavy restrictions on mortgages to make it harder to take out a home loan unless someone could clearly afford to make the monthly payments. But experts warn that there are far fewer restrictions on auto loans, meaning a consumer has to be savvier about what they are doing when they take out a loan. \"Predatory lending practices and a lack of real transportation options leave many households trapped in debt with few ways out,\u201d said Faye Park, president of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, which advocates for consumer protections. Repossessing a car is also a quick process thanks to technology and the laws in many states. Some cars are installed with devices that prevent the car from turning on if someone misses a payment and it has become easier to geo-locate a car to tow it away. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to repossess a vehicle than to foreclose on a home,\u201d Taiano said. He noted that non-prime and subprime auto loans increased from 28 percent of the market in 2009 to 39 percent in 2015, a reminder of how aggressively lenders went after borrowers who were on the margin of being able to pay. More lenders are giving people six or seven years to repay now vs. four of five years in the past, according to Experian, another tactic to try to make loans look affordable that might not otherwise be. While defaults on auto loans are a red flag, they are unlikely to take down the entire financial system as mortgages did in the lead-up to the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The total auto loan market is just over $1 trillion, far smaller than the $9 trillion home mortgage market. The amount of money people borrow to buy a car is also much smaller \u2014 typically under $35,000 \u2014 vs. a home loan, where people often borrow several hundred thousand dollars.

By that, he meant Virginia would gladly take all 50,000 high-paying jobs that Amazon once planned to split between Virginia and New York \u2014 until pushback from the left led the company to nix the Queens half of the deal. When he left office in January 2018, McAuliffe appeared to be well positioned for a White House run as a socially liberal, business-friendly Democrat from an important swing state. But 14 months later, it\u2019s unclear if there is room for McAuliffe, 62, in a party that seems to be pulling leftward. The expanding Democratic field includes contenders ranging from Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who want to raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for social programs, to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who wants national paid parental leave, to tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who supports a universal basic income. Complicating McAuliffe\u2019s deliberations \u2014 his self-imposed March 31 deadline for a decision is looming \u2014 is former vice president Joe Biden. A friend of 40 years, Biden would occupy the same center-left, establishment lane. If Biden gets in, McAuliffe would more than likely stay out, some friends say. \u201cThe only time you\u2019ll ever see the words \u2018deferential\u2019 and \u2018Terry McAuliffe\u2019 in the same sentence is [with regard to] Joe Biden,\u201d said one associate, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid about McAuliffe\u2019s private deliberations. But another person close to McAuliffe \u2014 who was in South Carolina on Tuesday for private meetings with Democratic legislators and other potential supporters \u2014 said the former governor has not ruled out running even if Biden gets in, noting that McAuliffe has executive experience that Biden lacks. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a factor,\u201d that person said of a potential Biden candidacy, \u201cbut it\u2019s not the deciding factor.\u201d On St. Patrick\u2019s Day, McAuliffe and his wife, Dorothy, were at the Dubliner, the iconic Irish bar in a hotel near the U.S. Capitol, when he teased the crowd. \u201cEverybody in this room, if I run for president, should vote for me for one reason,\u201d McAuliffe said, explaining how he helped the owner, Danny Coleman, save the bar from eviction 20 years ago. \u201cWe raised the money to buy this hotel and keep the Dubliner. So every time you drink, you drink to Terry McAuliffe. And it is time for an Irishman to be back in the White House.\u201d It was not clear which Irishman he meant. If Biden does run and McAuliffe does not, associates say, the former governor could serve as a highly visible surrogate \u2014 not just to help his friend but also to try to reel his party back from what he sees as a leftward drift endangering its chances to win back the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be impactful whether he gets in himself or whether he supports someone,\u201d said John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster associated with Biden. Left-wing resistance to McAuliffe has surprised some allies, who note that he went to bat for liberal social causes as he was luring business to his state. \u201cGovernor McAuliffe was the most progressive governor in Virginia history,\u201d said former chief of staff Paul Reagan, noting that McAuliffe removed the Confederate flag from license plates, restored voting rights to 173,000 ex-felons and expanded abortion rights and gay rights. McAuliffe made the case to the Republican-controlled legislature that Virginia needed to be friendly to women, LGBT people and racial minorities if it was going to attract investment. \u201cWe became open, welcoming,\u201d the Democrat said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d last month. \u201cThat\u2019s why we got Amazon.\u201d (Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) These days, McAuliffe argues the converse to liberals in his party: Democrats need to promote business \u2014 sometimes with economic incentives \u2014 to have the tax base to bankroll social programs. \u201cYou can talk about college for all or all these other things you want. What does it all take? It all takes money,\u201d McAuliffe said in an interview last week. \u201cWithout the economic engine, all the great ideas and plans for the future mean nothing. They\u2019re all talk.\u201d Raj Fernando, a Chicago entrepreneur and major donor to Hillary Clinton, said McAuliffe is the only Democrat he would be willing to back in a primary \u2014 precisely because the former governor is socially liberal and business friendly. \u201cTo make the world go round, you need jobs, you need money, you need tax revenue to pay for these things,\u201d he said. Even McAuliffe\u2019s harshest Republican critics acknowledged that he was a tireless promoter for Virginia, leading 35 foreign trade missions and attracting roughly $20\u00a0billion in capital investment and 207,000 new jobs. One company McAuliffe landed is CoStar Group. The D.C. real estate data firm was close to putting a large research and software development facility in North Carolina in 2016 when that state passed legislation known as HB2, dictating that transgender people use the bathroom corresponding with their sex at birth. \u201cThere was no way we were going to locate there when they were moving in that direction,\u201d said CoStar founder Andrew C. Florance. With an incentive package half the size of what North Carolina was dangling, McAuliffe lured the company to Richmond, where today it employs 700. \u201cWe\u2019ll generate roughly $50\u00a0million, $60\u00a0million in tax payments to Virginia, and they\u2019ll give us back $4\u00a0million or $6\u00a0million,\u201d Florance said, referring to incentives such as job training. \u201cI don\u2019t know how anybody can call it anything but a success story.\u201d But some on the Democratic Party\u2019s left call those incentives \u201ccorporate welfare.\u201d And they see McAuliffe as precisely the wrong face for the party, whether as a presidential nominee or surrogate. \u201cTerry McAuliffe represents the Democratic Party that catered to big donors and was about bundling [contributions] and maxing out,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a New York-based Democratic strategist. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren, called McAuliffe \u201ca consummate political insider\u201d who is \u201ccozy with big corporations.\u201d A number of Democratic presidential hopefuls say they won\u2019t take money from corporate political action committees or super PACS, including Sanders, Warren, Gillibrand, former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Tex.) and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). \u201cTo defeat Trump,\u201d Green said, \u201cwe need someone who voters see as authentically challenging corporate power and the political establishment.\u201d It\u2019s enough to make someone such as David Bossie, who once had a movie made about McAuliffe\u2019s sometimes-controversial business career titled \u201cFast Terry,\u201d sound almost like an admirer. \u201cTerry McAuliffe would give the field fits if he gets in, because he\u2019s very smart, very hard-working, and he would bring a depth and breadth to the field that is sorely lacking,\u201d said Bossie, president of Citizens United, a conservative advocacy group that won a 2010 Supreme Court ruling that allowed unlimited, and largely undisclosed, political spending by corporations and unions. He hastened to add: \u201cI\u2019m not being a fan here. I\u2019m being critical of the other candidates.\u201d \u201cDuring his governorship, I saw that he wanted Virginia open for business,\u201d said Bossie, who was Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 deputy campaign manager. \u201cThe Democratic Party seems to have lurched even further to the left in their blinding hatred of President Trump, and they\u2019re taking on unserious policy positions, as far as being against capitalism and for socialism, that will not sell well in a general election.\u201d Amy Walter, national editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said McAuliffe\u2019s long association with Bill and Hillary Clinton \u2014 he is a close friend and fundraiser \u2014 is a bigger political liability than his business-friendly approach. \u201cHe does have a good story to tell in Virginia,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question is whether that\u2019s enough for a primary electorate that is looking for the candidate who can beat Trump, which in many ways is the candidate who is not going to come with a lot of baggage. .\u2009.\u2009. Show me how you can beat Donald Trump when he runs an ad showing you hugging Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton? Tell me how you\u2019re going to fight the perception that you aren\u2019t simply part of the dreaded establishment and the swamp?\u201d Jesse Ferguson, deputy national press secretary for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, said Democrats of all stripes won primaries in last year\u2019s midterms. \u201cThe commonality was authenticity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when you look at 2020, you can win this primary from the left or the middle. If Terry McAuliffe tried to remake himself into a fire-breathing populist instead of a middle-class economics guy, no one would believe it.\u201d \u201cBut if he tries to run as a guy focused on middle-class economics, people have every reason to believe it because he\u2019s been doing it since he was doing driveway maintenance at age 14,\u201d Ferguson said, referring to McAuliffe\u2019s earliest entrepreneurial efforts. Democratic consultant Steve Elmendorf called McAuliffe \u201ctotally authentic.\u201d \u201cI think his personality and the way he carries himself, he\u2019s in a real position to be the counterpoint to Trump,\u201d Elmendorf said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s going to be more important than, \u2018Are you for Medicare-for-all or the Green New Deal?\u2019\u2009\u201d Former congressman Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) \u2014 who unsuccessfully ran for president twice, once with a youthful McAuliffe as his finance chairman \u2014 said McAuliffe has a good message for the party. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a place for him in the race if he decides to do it,\u201d said Gephardt, who served as minority and majority leader over a 28-year career in the House. \u201cHe did a great job as governor. Everything I\u2019ve seen and heard is A-plus. And his main emphasis was jobs, which always is a major issue in any campaign.\u201d Others see a tough climate for him. \u201cA few years ago, coming off of an incredibly successful governorship where he proved that he could be a leader of the commonwealth, he would be right at the top of just about anybody\u2019s list for president,\u201d said Todd Haymore, McAuliffe\u2019s former secretary of commerce and trade. \u201cBut now with the party seemingly moving further and further left .\u2009.\u2009. Terry McAuliffe could be the odd man out.\u201d","105":"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 The Washington Nationals made two tweaks to their baseball operations staff on Tuesday, promoting both Mike DeBartolo and Sam Mondry-Cohen to assistant general manager. DeBartolo spent the last three seasons as the Nationals\u2019 director of baseball operations. Mondry-Cohen was the organization\u2019s director of baseball research and development for the past four years. They will each remain focused in those areas, as their new titles suggest: assistant general manager, baseball operations for DeBartolo; assistant general manager, baseball research and development for Mondry-Cohen. The moves give General Manager Mike Rizzo five assistants, as DeBartolo and Mondry-Cohen join Doug Harris (player personnel), Kris Kline (scouting operations) and Ted Towne (finance). The Nationals had room to promote a new assistant general manager, or two, after Bob Miller did not have his contract renewed following last season. Miller was with the organization for the last three seasons, and first worked with Rizzo when they started with the Arizona Diamondbacks on the same day in 1998. Miller focused on contract negotiations and most notably discovered the loophole in MLB rules that allowed the Nationals to trade for Trea Turner just six months after the San Diego Padres drafted him as a player to be named later. While it\u2019s not a one-to-one replacement, DeBartolo now fills that role on Rizzo\u2019s staff. DeBartolo started with Washington in 2012, as a baseball operations department intern, and graduated from Columbia Business School a year later. He was a baseball operations analyst in 2014, manager of baseball research and development in 2015, then served as the director of operations from 2016 to now. His new position gives him a prominent role in 40-man roster decisions, from salary arbitration, contract extensions, free agency, trades and so on. Mondry-Cohen will \u201coversee the front office\u2019s analysis of baseball data and development of department wide baseball systems,\u201d according to a Nationals release. That will include the projection of player performance, strategic planning and the use of date to optimize on-field performance. Among Rizzo and the five assistant GMs, Mondry-Cohen has spent the most time in the analytics department. He joined the franchise as a baseball operations intern in 2009, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2010, worked four seasons as a baseball operations analyst, spent 2014 as the team\u2019s manager of baseball analytics and has since run that team.

The State Board of Elections \u2014 three Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 voted unanimously to call for a new election. It might have been the first recorded instance of a federal election being thrown out over fraud. But it wasn\u2019t the evidence of fraud that made it happen. It was a heart-wrenching drama between an evangelical minister, who badly wanted to serve in Congress, and his lawyer son, who came forward with evidence that contradicted his father\u2019s testimony. Republicans and Democrats agreed that something went right compared with how partisan conflict often plays out in the country\u2019s hyper-polarized political environment. But it almost didn\u2019t, despite voluminous evidence that a political operative had led an illegal scheme to tamper with absentee ballots on behalf of Republican Mark Harris of Charlotte. And that worries those who see a massive threat to the integrity of elections in what happened in the 9th District \u2014 and believe it could easily happen again if nothing is done to prevent it. \u201cWithout focused commitment by prosecutors and advocates, the stakes will remain unacceptably high,\u201d said Josh Lawson, the state board\u2019s general counsel. \u201cOur unanimous vote only begins to set things right.\u201d Harris took the stand Thursday, the fourth day of testimony before the elections board in a hearing to examine the evidence of fraud in the 9th District. It was clear that he intended to continue fighting for a seat in Congress. He had lost a close primary for the seat in 2016 and led the 2018 race by 905 votes over Democrat Dan McCready. Harris described the structure of his campaign and his relationship with the operative at the center of the investigation \u2014 a man named Leslie McCrae Dowless. And he denied, vehemently, that he knew anything about Dowless\u2019s alleged scheme to illegally collect, fill in, forge and submit mail-in ballots from voters in two rural North Carolina counties. The hearing had taken a dramatic turn the previous day, when Harris\u2019s 29-year-old son John, an assistant U.S. attorney in Raleigh, took the stand and described conversations and emails with his father in 2017 in which he warned the elder Harris against hiring Dowless. John Harris believed Dowless had broken the law in a previous election. Harris parried confidently about his son\u2019s testimony, explaining that he hadn\u2019t taken the advice seriously. \u201cMy son was still my son \u2014 27 years old,\u201d he said. What Harris did not say is that he had told another son, Matthew, on the eve of John\u2019s testimony that he did not think his emails with John would come up in the hearing. He did not know that John Harris had already turned over the emails. More important, it was a sign that his campaign may not have fully complied with the state board\u2019s subpoena for documents and communications related to Dowless. Lawson asked Harris whether he had told anyone this week that he did not expect his emails with his son to become public. \u201cI don\u2019t recall specifically saying that,\u201d Harris testified. Lawson asked twice more. The answer was the same. Other lawyers in the room perked up: Lawson\u2019s questions suggested Harris might have just lied under oath. When McCready\u2019s lawyer, Marc Elias, began questioning Harris, he quickly turned to the same question. That\u2019s when Harris\u2019s lawyer, David Freedman, stood up abruptly and stopped the proceedings. Freedman was required under legal ethics rules to inform the board that Harris might be lying. In a closed-door session with lawyers for all the parties, Freedman offered to return Harris to the stand to \u201ccorrect\u201d his testimony, according to three people with knowledge of the meeting. Everyone sensed an opportunity to bring the saga to an end. Harris faced potential legal jeopardy and a brutal cross-examination from Elias, a prominent and aggressive Democratic lawyer from Washington. The board\u2019s lawyers asked Elias whether he would let Harris go if Harris also agreed to say that a new election was warranted. Freedman mentioned Harris\u2019s health problems \u2014 he was still recovering from a serious infection that had led to sepsis and two strokes. Freedman added that Harris\u2019s medications had affected his memory on the stand. Lawson angrily replied that Harris could not blame his false statements on medication unless he provided a list of his medications with documentation of their side effects. He also demanded that Harris say the evidence of fraud presented this week had tainted the outcome in November. Freedman agreed. But it wasn\u2019t over yet. The five-member elections board still had to formally vote to call a new election, and even after that agreement was reached among the lawyers, the two Republicans on the board still weren\u2019t sure, said Stella Anderson, one of the Democratic board members. \u201cAll along, we knew one side of the argument would be that unless we could demonstrate that 905 votes were corrupt, then there\u2019s no issue here,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThat was definitely still the mind-set.\u201d One of those Republicans, David Black, remembers it differently. Black said there was a robust discussion about the seriousness of the decision to call a new election. \u201cBut when Josh came in and said this is what Harris is going to do, I thought, \u2018This is over.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The second Republican on the board, Ken Raymond, did not respond to a request for an interview. Under a provision in North Carolina election law, the board has the power to call for a new election even without reaching the threshold to alter the margin of victory. The provision is meant for circumstances where fraud is sufficiently problematic \u2014 for instance if a campaign or a public official is aware of it \u2014 to cast a general \u201ctaint\u201d on the integrity of the results. Black acknowledged that he had been reluctant to invoke that legal provision. His position changed when he learned that Harris would state that the results were tainted, he said. The board chairman, Bob Cordle, also a Democrat, argued that it was important to the integrity of the institution that the panel vote unanimously, Anderson said. Finally, Anderson said, the five members agreed to vote for a new election. The outcome is bittersweet for those who have been trying for years to call attention to election fraud in the 9th District, which runs along the South Carolina line from Charlotte to rural eastern North Carolina. The board\u2019s decision Thursday prompted widespread praise \u2014 and promises to take action. Robin Hayes, the chairman of the state GOP, and state Sen. Phil Berger (R), the president of the North Carolina Senate, said reforms to state election law are likely. Even President Trump weighed in, saying Friday: \u201cI condemn any kind of voter fraud at all, whether it\u2019s Democrat or Republican.\u201d But some who had pushed for a new election said it was the human drama of the Harris family, and not the facts of the case, that prompted the decision. The board had not even heard all the evidence or pieced it together before Thursday\u2019s drama unfolded. There was the way Harris structured his campaign so that Dowless, the operative, would be paid by a middleman consulting firm called Red Dome Group, preventing the payments from showing up on federal campaign reports. There was the lack of oversight by either Harris or Red Dome of Dowless\u2019s activities. Their accounting records show that he was paid for legal activities such as get-out-the-vote work and legal collection of absentee-ballot request forms. Demanding that he document his work would have revealed that he wasn\u2019t spending much of his time on those activities. There were suspected campaign finance violations by the Harris campaign that the board staff plans to forward to the Federal Election Commission. All of it added up to a worrisome scenario, Lawson and others said, that should never be allowed to take place in a congressional election. \u201cHad I had the opportunity to continue the cross-examination, and also put on further evidence, it would have become even clearer how deep the fraud scheme ran and the involvement of all the players,\u201d said Elias, McCready\u2019s lawyer. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s important that people not take Dr. Harris\u2019s statements on the stand as an act of graciousness. His statements were the actions of a desperate man who had been caught in a lie who was trying to figure out how to get out of that.\u201d Scrutiny of the fraud allegations is not over. On Saturday, Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman told The Washington Post that she plans within 30 days to begin presenting evidence regarding the 2016 and 2018 elections to a grand jury. There may have been no better illustration of Harris\u2019s plight than his abrupt departure from the hearing. After announcing his belief that a new election was in order, he stepped off the dais and walked out of the room with his wife, Beth. His lawyers, still in the midst of the proceeding, stayed behind \u2014 leaving the Harrises to fend off a phalanx of television cameras alone. His shoulders stooped and his head down, Harris, in footage captured by WBTV, walked about a half-block to a waiting car, climbed in and drove away.","107":"Joshua Matz and Larry Tribe, authors of \u201cTo End a Presidency: The Power of Impeachment,\u201d recently wrote: Over time, a focus on impeachment can flatten and distort our politics. Many of [President] Trump\u2019s worst policies can\u2019t properly be squeezed into an impeachment framework. The same might be said about many of Trump\u2019s scariest foreign-policy judgments and public statements. The Muslim ban, family separation, erratic negotiations with North Korea, and inaction on climate change\u2014these are abhorrent policies, but they are not impeachable offenses. When the only worthwhile end game is Trump\u2019s removal from office, justifiable outrage over these issues too quickly recedes into the background, even as we are treated to an endless diet of speculative headlines about Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s secret files. And if impeachment were to unfold, with the Senate almost certainly unable to reach a two-thirds majority for removal, what would all of this have accomplished? Perhaps equally alarming would be the reaction of a good 30 percent of the voters if Trump were removed. They\u2019d be convinced that the \u201cdeep state\u201d executed a coup. The anger, alienation and political fissures that would ensue would do huge damage to our already shaky democracy. We should also be realistic about the election calendar. Assuming Mueller would have to return a report, House hearings would need to be held, and then a vote on impeachment would follow in the committee and later the full House. Then we\u2019d go over to the Senate for a full trial. It\u2019s hard to imagine this wouldn\u2019t spill into calendar year 2020. Would we really prefer that excruciating process, when the presidential campaign, which would be fully underway, would allow voters to deliver their own verdict in 2020? Taking a step back, the focus on the Mueller report (even to the exclusion of all the other investigations) has distorted our evaluation of the president\u2019s conduct. The anticipation about the report \u2014 and each verdict or plea that precedes it \u2014 overshadow the president\u2019s abject ignorance, instability, dishonesty and incompetence. If the sole determination of a president\u2019s survival and reelection is \u201ccouldn\u2019t pin a high crime and misdemeanor on him,\u201d we\u2019re going to wind up with many more ignorant, unstable, dishonest and incompetent presidents. We\u2019ll have inadvertently made it easier for unfit presidents to avoid political consequences by confusing impeachment and removal with a political determination of the president\u2019s performance. There are two other key considerations here. First, the voters provided a check on Trump in the form of a Democratic House majority in 2018. However, a clear majority of voters said they were opposed to impeachment. They pretty clearly told us they want oversight, investigation and restraint but not removal \u2014 at least based on what they knew on Election Day. We diminish the importance of midterms and of Congress\u2019s normal oversight role by defaulting to impeachment as the only means of preventing damage to our constitutional system. We\u2019ve seen this play out in the fight over the emergency declaration, an assertion of brute power unsupported by facts or the Constitution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in remarks on Monday didn\u2019t call for impeachment. Rather, she said: I know that our Republican colleagues care about the Constitution of the United States. I know that they believe in the separation of powers. \u00a0I know that they don\u2019t want a President, Republican or Democrat, to usurp the powers of the institution in which we serve. I know that they are committed to strengthening the Congress of the United States, which is the institution we all serve, as part of the separation of powers, the checks and balances, the strengths we all bring in the People\u2019s House and in the Senate as well. \u00a0... This is a historic moment for our country. Perhaps it affords us the opportunity for all Americans to have civics lesson about the Constitution of the United States, the protections therein including freedom of the press which is our strength \u2014 the guardian of the gate of our democracy. There are few moments where there is a priceless opportunity for civic education without the potential that one side will be entirely vanquished (as with impeachment and removal). Undergoing some periodic refresher courses in separation of powers helps to ward off future power grabs and encourage devotion to the Constitution. Second, in all the talk of impeachment and possible indictment, we\u2019ve collectively gotten lost in the weeds. \u201cWell, it\u2019s maybe not really a criminal campaign finance violation.\u201d Stop! The president\u2019s payments to women to disguise alleged affairs and repeated lying to the American people are totally unacceptable. Such actions should be grounds in and of themselves for booting him out of office in 2020. Whether it\u2019s a criminal matter, and a serious enough criminal matter to warrant impeachment, misses the mark. Instead we should have the public debate as to whether someone of such sleazy character willing to perpetuate a lie has any business being in office. The conclusion should be a moral and political no-brainer; however, when we\u2019re obsessed with impeachment, we tend to avoid the debate as to the bare minimum standards we expect a president to uphold. The same default to legalisms is seen in the context of witness-tampering. (Hmmm, does falsely hinting about a White House taping system in advance of James Comey\u2019s testimony meet the letter of the criminal statue?) We see it play out in consideration of his \u201csimply\u201d lying to hide his ongoing deal for a Moscow Trump Tower from the voters. (Recall this apparently prompted him to act as Vladimir Putin\u2019s apologist and PR man.) Frankly, we shouldn\u2019t care if conducting business with a foe of the United States and lying about it to get elected are illegal; the actions are outrageous and a betrayal of his country. Instead of fodder for articles of impeachment, the particulars of Trump\u2019s egregious conduct should form the unassailable argument for Republicans to dump him as their nominee, and in the event they do not, for the rest of us, regardless of ideological differences with the other party, to vote Trump out. The lesson should be a party that enables and rationalizes such conduct loses power, maybe for a very long time. We want to know the facts about Trump\u2019s conduct, for with facts comes accountability for Trump and his enablers. Moreover, being president is not a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card; it is important to see the president held to the same criminal, legal standards as the rest of us and if warranted, indicted, tried and convicted after leaving office. For now, I agree Democratic presidential contenders should largely ignore Trump and focus on policy and their own qualifications. However, in the general election it is imperative that the nominee present the case to the jury \u2014 the American people \u2014 for Trump\u2019s removal. It\u2019s at the ballot box that we can vindicate the rule of law and reinforce democratic norms. Reducing the Trump fiasco to a binary choice between impeachment or his survival would relieve voters of the awesome responsibility of self-governance and deprive us of what is turning out to be the most magnificent and edifying seminar in American constitutional government one could ever hope to attend.

Mueller III isn\u2019t expected to submit his report to the Justice Department this week. That means the big news on that front will be Michael Cohen, who is expected to deliver \u201cscathing\u201d testimony about his former boss, President Trump. So with Cohen set to appear on Capitol Hill each of the next three days, here\u2019s a little primer. Cohen is testifying for three straight days, but only one of the hearings will be public. After testifying behind closed doors on Tuesday to the Senate Intelligence Committee, he has a public date Wednesday with the House Oversight and Governmental Reform Committee, and then will go back behind closed doors Thursday with the House Intelligence Committee. Cohen\u2019s testimony to all three committees has been delayed, with the stated reasons being threats from President Trump (who has alleged wrongdoing by Cohen\u2019s family members) and Cohen\u2019s recovery from shoulder surgery. Cohen will deliver his testimony a little more than two months before he is supposed to report for a three-year prison term for the nine counts he has pleaded guilty to. Cohen is the first member of Trump\u2019s inner circle to provide eyewitness testimony about alleged misdeeds by the president. While other former aides have flipped and spoken to prosecutors, Cohen has spoken publicly and indicated that he thinks it\u2019s his duty to atone for his own wrongdoing. And now that Democrats control the House, he has been given a platform. Even before testifying, Cohen has spoken out repeatedly about Trump, has helped prosecutors implicate him in campaign finance violations and has reached a key plea deal with Mueller in which he admitted to lying about the Trump Tower Moscow effort. Cohen is not just a former campaign aide, but also someone who had been around Trump years before by serving as his personal lawyer and \u201cfixer.\u201d In other words, he is someone who could speak to many different facets of Trump. That combination and Cohen\u2019s stated desire to hold Trump accountable makes him a one-of-a-kind witness. Although Cohen has spoken publicly, it has been infrequent, and we don\u2019t know what else he might be prepared to disclose or allege. Back when Cohen\u2019s testimony was first announced, I outlined five areas he could shed some light on. Here\u2019s a brief summary of each (and for those who want to go deeper, here are 20 more from The Post\u2019s Matt Zapotosky and Rosalind S. Helderman): Given Cohen is a figure in both the Mueller investigation and in the Southern District of New York\u2019s Trump-related probes, and that those probes are ongoing, he will be limited in certain ways. The Post\u2019s Karoun Demirjian and Zapotosky report that Cohen \u201cis expected to deliver specific and scathing testimony about his former boss\u2019s business interests in Russia and a scheme to buy the silence of adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\u201d They also say all questions about the Russia investigation will be handled in the private hearings Tuesday and Thursday. A source close to Cohen said he should be able to answer \u201call questions except subjects under SDNY investigation\u201d and \u201climited issues before special counsel.\u201d Parsing what is and isn\u2019t fair game as the hearings progress will be a subplot, in and of itself. Also keep in mind that, while he will be testifying behind closed doors on Tuesday and Thursday, those interviews could eventually be released, as other Intelligence Committee interviews have been.","109":"Top pharmaceutical executives lined up at a Senate hearing Tuesday and expressed deep compassion for patients suffering from disease. They decried high co-payments that shock consumers at the pharmacy counter. They denounced rebates they pay to insurance companies. But while they were eager to indict a system they said is badly broken, they declined to commit to lowering their own prices. The CEOs from Pfizer, Merck, Sanofi and others were subjected to a ritualistic grilling. But the executives  survived the three hours of questioning largely unscathed by deflecting blame for their list prices to insurance companies, despite an admonishment from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) that he would not stand for finger-pointing. The industry leaders said they are forced to set prices higher so they can pay big rebates to insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). They acknowledged that practice especially hurts consumers without insurance, who pay full list price at the pharmacy, as well as those with coverage whose co-payment is a percentage of the list price. They insisted they are not to blame for the pain. \u201cThe list price is actually working against the patient,\u2019\u2019 said Merck chief executive Kenneth C. Frazier, a stark acknowledgment that the industry\u2019s role in setting prices is hurting individuals. \u201cThe people who can least afford it are paying the most.\u2019\u2019 The answer, Frazier and the other executives said, is not government price controls on drug prices or Medicare negotiation of drug prices, but rather getting rid of rebates throughout the system. The Trump administration last month proposed eliminating rebates from certain Medicare and Medicaid programs. But the executives said that will not result in lower manufacturer list prices unless it is applied throughout the commercial insurance industry as well. Senators repeatedly took the executives to task for patent and pricing practices that seem designed to protect profits, despite enormous subsidies they receive from American taxpayers in the form of National Institutes of Health research, and research and development tax breaks. Under questioning, most of the executives said their companies did not use the Republicans\u2019 corporate tax cuts to lower prices. \u201cYou pharma executives are here because the way you do business is unacceptable and unsustainable,\u2019\u2019 the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Ron Wyden (Ore.), said in his opening statement. \u201cDrugmakers behave as if patients and taxpayers are unlocked ATMs full of cash to be extracted, and their shareholders are the customers they value above all else.\u2019\u2019 At the outset, Grassley set a tough tone. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the finger-pointing. Every link in the supply chain has gotten skilled at that,\u2019\u2019 Grassley said. \u201cBut like most Americans, I\u2019m sick and tired of the blame game. It\u2019s time for solutions.\u2019\u2019 He expressed dismay over arguments by drugmakers that the list prices are just starting points for negotiations with insurance companies and middlemen. That excuse leaves Medicare patients, consumers with high-deductible plans and taxpayers holding the bag for higher costs, Grassley said. \u201cWe cannot allow anyone to hide behind the current complexities to shield the true cost of drugs,\u2019\u2019 Grassley said. In addition to Pfizer, Merck and AbbVie, the top executives assembled before Grassley and other committee members represented AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit, and Sanofi. After the hearing, Grassley said he plans to convene another hearing to dig into insurance companies and their allied pharmacy benefit managers. Drug companies are on the defensive   after Democrats recaptured the House with arguments that health-care costs are out of control. President Trump has capitalized on popular anger over drug costs, giving prescription drug executives rare cause for worry in a capital where they typically win their lobbying battles. Grassley has said he opposes giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices, a move favored by Democrats. But he said he\u2019s hopeful of passing legislation that would require drug companies to sell samples of their products to generic manufacturers, and he wants to push another bill to curb \u201cpay for delay\u2019\u2019 deals that keep generics off the market even after brand patents have expired. AbbVie received some of the harshest scrutiny at Tuesday\u2019s hearing. Its drug Humira has remained the biggest-selling drug in the world with the help of legal strategies that have kept generic versions off the U.S. market. \u201cAbbVie protects the exclusivity of Humira like Gollum with his ring,\u2019\u2019 Wyden said. \u201cThick cobwebs of patents, legal tricks, and shadowy deals with other drugmakers, all to keep the cash flowing.\u2019\u2019 Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) expressed astonishment the company was able to extend market exclusivity on some uses of Humira until 2034, 31 years after its introduction. And Wyden forced AbbVie CEO Richard A. Gonzalez to acknowledge that the more than $10\u00a0million he received in bonuses over a multiyear span was based in part on Humira\u2019s sales performance. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) echoed the deep frustration she said she hears from residents in her home state, the first party primary state, where presidential candidates are already trooping to diners and general stores. \u201cRight now it is so convoluted and so not transparent that my constituents can\u2019t figure out what the price of their medications should be day-to-day,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI feel like I need a PhD in prescription drug pricing to figure out how this industry works.\u2019\u2019 But the baseline strategy for the assembled executives was pinning the blame for prices on insurance companies. Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla told the committee in his prepared testimony that insurance companies are not passing on the discounts from rebates to patients. \u201cNone of the close to $12 billion of rebates that Pfizer paid in 2018 found their way to American patients,\u2019\u2019 Bourla said. \u201cPfizer supports reforms that would create a system in which transparent, upfront discounts benefit patients at the pharmacy counter, rather than a system driven by rebates that are swallowed up by companies in the supply chain.\u2019\u2019 Bourla and other executives repeatedly said they favored \u201cvalue-based\u2019\u2019 reimbursement, under which drugmakers would get paid based on the number of strokes their medicines prevented or the number of cancer patients in full remission, \u201crather than the number of pills we sell,\u2019\u2019 Bourla said. \u201cIn such a system, if our medicines do not produce results, we would be paid less,\u2019\u2019 he said. The executives repeatedly emphasized the billions they spend on research and development of new drugs. Compared with other developed countries, Americans pay higher drug prices for brand prescriptions to support those discovery efforts, they said. Grassley\u2019s committee has begun an investigation of insulin prices, which put Sanofi chief executive Olivier Brandicourt under a particularly harsh spotlight. Insulin prices have generated intense outrage because the drug is many decades old and because Sanofi and two other manufacturers, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, have boosted prices simultaneously. In his written testimony, Brandicourt also shifted blame to the insurance reimbursement system. He differentiated between the \u201cnet price,\u201d after rebates paid to insurance companies and PBMs, and the list price. Sanofi is actually gaining less net revenue as its rebates to insurers grow, he said. The post-rebate \u201cnet price\u2019\u2019 of Sanofi insulin product Lantus has fallen more than 30\u00a0percent since 2012, Brandicourt said, while average out-of-pocket costs for patients with insurance have risen 60\u00a0percent. He cited Sanofi assistance programs that offer financial help to patients who cannot afford insulin. The debate continued to rage outside the hearing room, with drug companies attracting negative reaction from the insurance industry and consumer advocates. Matt Eyles, president and CEO of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, said he was encouraged by manufacturers\u2019 willingness to work on lower drug costs for patients. \u201cBut we still heard much more from Big Pharma about casting blame on others for high prices,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cDrugmakers alone set drug prices, they alone increase prices, and they alone could decide to reduce drug prices.\u2019\u2019","110":"So far, so good. President Trump has inflicted immense damage on the rule of law and on our democratic norms, but to date the system \u2014 Trump calls it the \u201cdeep state,\u201d the rest of us call it constitutional government \u2014 has held. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, despite threats, insults and president\u2019s refusal to sit for an interview, completed his work. He racked up 37 indictments, convictions or plea deals (nearly 200 charges) from three Russian companies and other individuals, including the president\u2019s former campaign chief, his former deputy campaign chief, his former national security adviser and his former personal lawyer. Mueller revealed in indictments a widespread Russian plot to interfere with our 2016 presidential election on behalf of Trump through social media, live events and hacking. We know that multiple members of the Trump campaign had contacts with Russians, that Trump lied about doing business with Russia (when in fact he pursued a lucrative deal in Russia while running for president), and that Trump (in public comments) and associates let it be known they\u2019d welcome the help of a hostile foreign power. Trump can holler all he wants, but we will never know if he could have won without the help of the Kremlin. We know Paul Manafort provided internal polling data to a Russian connected to Putin\u2019s intelligence operation. Thanks to Mueller, who referred part of his investigation to the Southern District of New York prosecutors, we also know of a conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws in order to hide from voters hush money to cover up Trump\u2019s extramarital affairs. We also know of Trump\u2019s pattern to discredit and dislodge the investigations into him and his associates by, among other things, pressuring then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to un-recuse himself, imploring his White House counsel to fire Mueller, firing FBI Director James B. Comey, publicly trashing the prosecution while Manafort\u2019s trial was ongoing, concocting false conspiracy theories (e.g., President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, the FBI misleading the FISA court), suggesting one of his potential allies take over the Southern District of New York prosecution from which he had already recused himself, drafting a misleading account of the Trump Tower meeting and refusing to sit for an interview with Mueller. Mueller did not indict the president in violation of current Justice Department guidelines, leak to the press or respond to Trump\u2019s outrageous attacks. Mueller\u2019s conduct exemplified honorable public service. His actions set an example for how prosecutors and other public servants should conduct themselves. Moreover, Mueller showed that an unhinged president could not stop an investigation into his wrongdoing. When Trump is long gone, what will be remembered is that neither Mueller, Sessions, Comey, Rod J. Rosenstein, William P. Barr, nor even the hapless Matthew G. Whitaker, allowed Trump to thwart the investigation. We have yet to find out whether Trump personally directed or had knowledge of his associates\u2019 contacts with Russia. We have yet to find out whether, but for Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president, Trump would have been charged with obstruction or other crimes. And we do not know whether Trump, his family or other associates will be charged with financial crimes arising out of the Southern District of New York\u2019s investigation. The country owes a deep debt of gratitude to Mueller and his team for their competence, professionalism and defense of the rule of law. Whatever the result of his report, we can say, well done, Mr. Mueller. Read more: Randall D. Eliason: Mueller\u2019s investigation is over. Americans should breathe a sigh of relief.

He was a 72-year-old white male moderate from a small town at a moment when Democrats were fixated on how they got whupped so badly in rural areas. Bill Clinton carried the Bluegrass State in 1996, but Hillary Clinton garnered less than 33 percent of the vote two decades later. Seated at a table in an old-fashioned diner, Beshear opened with a gaffe. \u201cI\u2019m a proud Democrat, but first and foremost, I\u2019m a proud Republican, and Democrat, and mostly, American,\u201d he said. Chuck and Nancy have picked another Southerner to deliver the 2019 response, but she\u2019s different in almost every way. And that reflects the mood of the moment in Democratic politics. Stacey Abrams, 45, last year became the first black woman ever nominated by a major party for governor. The former minority leader in the Georgia state House is unapologetically liberal, even though she\u2019s from a red state. While Beshear went to a state school, Abrams earned her law degree from Yale. Beshear has been married for 50 years and has two grown kids; Abrams, who is single, has never been married and has no children. He\u2019s mild-mannered; she\u2019s fiery. \u201cI plan to deliver a vision for prosperity and equality, where everyone in our nation has a voice and where each of those voices is heard,\u201d Abrams said in a statement. -- The shift from Steve to Stacey, with Joe Kennedy III in between, is a nod by party chieftains to what they perceive as growing grass-roots hunger for fresh faces of color who are young and female.  \u201cWe were sitting around thinking about this three weeks ago, and her name came up. Immediately, everyone in the room said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it,\u2019\u201d Schumer (D-N.Y.) told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \u201cShe\u2019s an amazing person with an amazing story.\u201d Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Abrams \u201cembodies the American Dream.\u201d \u201cHer electrifying message of courage, perseverance and hope reinvigorated our nation and our politics, and continues to inspire millions of Americans in every part of the country,\u201d the speaker said. -- Abrams has emerged as an avatar of the resistance movement. \u201cAbrams has refused to cede defeat in the governor\u2019s race since ending her campaign on Nov. 17 with a defiant speech blaming her loss on voting irregularities. She received 48.8 percent of the vote to Brian Kemp\u2019s 50.2 percent,\u201d Vanessa Williams noted in a feature story about her last week. \u201cInstead, Abrams announced a new organization, Fair Fight Georgia, focused on battling voter suppression. The group filed a federal lawsuit against state elections officials, alleging that they \u2018grossly mismanaged\u2019 the 2018 election and violated Georgians\u2019 constitutional and civil rights. State officials have until the end of the month to respond to the suit.\u201d -- 2018 was another Year of the Woman, and 2020 may be as well. Exit polls showed a historic gender gap, with women favoring Democrats by 19 points and men favoring Republicans by four points. The first three Democratic senators to launch presidential campaigns are female. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) toppled a white guy who was twice her age, and No. 4 in party leadership, in a Democratic primary last summer. Still only 29, AOC has emerged as the unofficial leader of a freshman class that includes 40 women. \u201cPicking a black woman to deliver this speech is a powerful statement about where the Democratic Party is and where the nation is,\u201d Democratic strategist Karine Jean-Pierre told Eugene Scott. \u201cThe contrast with Trump could not be more stark.\u201d -- One reason Schumer picked Abrams is that he wants her to run for Senate next year against Republican incumbent David Perdue. The minority leader made the case to Abrams during a meeting last month in Washington. If she got in, Democratic odds of winning control of the upper chamber would increase. At the very least, Republicans would be forced to spends tens of millions more to hold the seat than they would otherwise. Abrams says she will run for office again, but she\u2019s not sure which one. She\u2019s given herself until the end of March to decide about the Senate. If she doesn\u2019t do it, she\u2019d likely be on shortlists of vice-presidential picks in the summer of 2020. If a Democrat defeats Trump, she could be a prime candidate for a spot in anyone\u2019s Cabinet in 2021. She could also challenge the governor in a 2022 rematch. Last week, on MLK day, Abrams launched a statewide tour in Albany, Ga., to thank people who supported her in 2018. A poll released the Friday before last by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that 52 percent of registered Georgia voters view her favorably. Kemp\u2019s approval rating is only 37 percent. -- Trump claimed last fall that Abrams was \u201cnot qualified\u201d to lead a state, even though she has more governing experience than he did when he became president. The president also warned at a pre-election rally in Macon that Georgia would \u201cturn into Venezuela\u201d if she won. Responding to yesterday\u2019s announcement, the Republican National Committee called Abrams a loser who is in a \u201cnever-ending pursuit of the public limelight.\u201d RNC spokeswoman Ellie Hockenbury said in a statement: \u201cWhile Chuck Schumer may feel her agenda would be a good fit for national Democrats, it\u2019s worth remembering that it wasn\u2019t even a good fit for her fellow Georgians who rejected her bid for governor just last year.\u201d -- Abrams won\u2019t just be the first black woman to give the official State of the Union response, a tradition that began in 1966. She\u2019ll also be the first person to do so who does not currently hold elected office. Vox editor Ezra Klein observes that some of the biggest Democratic stars coming out of 2018 lost their races, including Abrams, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Andrew Gillum. -- Speaking on the Senate floor yesterday, Schumer also said that he read \u201cwith interest\u201d the Daily 202\u2019s coverage from the Koch network\u2019s \u201ctouchy-feely\u201d donor meeting. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not sort of just a fig leaf because they\u2019re getting such bad publicity and America is moving so far away from what they believe,\u201d the Democratic leader said. \u201cColor me skeptical,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe Koch brothers may sit out the presidential contest, as they did in 2016, but their political arm, Americans for Prosperity, continues to support candidates who are divisive, who do not bring us together. Some of the ads you see, the very candidates they support, are dividing us. You can\u2019t on the one hand say you want to bring us together and on the other use your political arm to tear us apart. \u2026 They support the kinds of judges who agree with them on all the corporate stuff, that don\u2019t want regulation and who are against voting rights. How does that bring us together?\u201d Koch network spokesman James Davis replies: \u201cPeople are tired of the politics of division. We are committed to uniting with anyone to do right, just like we did on criminal justice reform and Right to Try legislation. Let\u2019s come together on a solution for immigration.\u201d WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: A tour group from Trinity Presbyterian School in\u00a0Montgomery, Ala., tours the Lincoln Memorial on Tuesday afternoon. (Jonathan Newton\/The Washington Post) -- The government is operating on a three-hour delay because of\u00a0the wintry weather. Many of the D.C. region\u2019s schools are also opening late or closing their doors today. Here is the full list. -- The wind chill could dip below zero in Washington today. The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: \u201cThe truly bitter blast isn\u2019t here quite yet. But it\u2019s still a cold winter day with morning temperatures rising into and through the 20s \u2014 watch out for icy spots \u2014 and afternoon highs in the upper 20s to mid-30s. \u2026 Partly sunny morning skies turn mostly cloudy late morning into the afternoon, when a few snow showers could put down a quick coating in spots. \u2026 The bitter cold and dry air pour in as evening temperatures drop like a rock through the 20s and teens. Most spots should see lows in the single digits, maybe all the way down to near zero in our coldest north and west suburbs, and perhaps holding up near 10 degrees downtown.\u201d -- Meanwhile, the Midwest is facing a historically cold polar vortex that has already been blamed for one death in Minnesota. Katie Mettler, Christopher Ingraham, Samantha Schmidt and Angela Fritz report: \u201cIt has caused statewide declarations of emergency, school closures, Postal Service interruptions and 1,000 airline flight cancellations across the country. Wind chill estimates plummeted to minus-50 in the Dakotas and northern Minnesota on Tuesday morning, and that same, painfully frigid air is forecast to spread southeast into Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago and Detroit. Winds will make it feel like temperatures of minus-30 to minus-40 as far south as Illinois and northern Indiana; it is forecast to feel as low as minus-65 across the northern Great Lakes region.\u201d Jussie Smollett, a cast member in\u00a0\u201cEmpire,\u201d was attacked in a potential hate crime in Chicago. (Evan Agostini\/Invision\/AP) GET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b CARACAS ON THE BRINK: -- Venezuelan authorities froze the bank accounts of self-declared interim president Juan Guaid\u00f3 and sought to block him from leaving the country as President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro tries to quash the most legitimate threat yet to his power. Andreina Aponte, Rachelle Krygier and Anthony Faiola report: \u201cMaduro\u2019s chief prosecutor made the request, which was later ratified by the loyalist Supreme Court as a preventative measure pending a full investigation. The move stopped short of a detention order \u2014 something the Trump administration has strongly warned against. \u2026 Speaking at the opposition-led National Assembly, which he heads, Guaid\u00f3 responded to the move by dismissing it as \u2018nothing new under the sun.\u2019 He said it came from \u2018a regime that doesn\u2019t give answers to Venezuelans\u2019 and whose \u2018only answer is persecution and repression.\u2019 Guaid\u00f3 added: \u2018The world is clear on what\u2019s happening in Venezuela. \u2026\u00a0Let\u2019s not desist because of threats and persecution.\u2019 \u201cThe United States, which backs Guaid\u00f3 as the legitimate leader of Venezuela, pushed back hard against the chief prosecutor\u2019s effort. \u2018We denounce the illegitimate former Venezuelan Attorney General\u2019s threats against President Juan Guaido,\u2019 White House national security adviser John Bolton wrote on Twitter. \u2018Let me reiterate\u2014there will be serious consequences for those who attempt to subvert democracy and harm Guaido.\u2019\u201d -- Trump tweeted this morning: \u201cAmericans should not travel to Venezuela until further notice.\u201d\u00a0 -- Maduro is attempting to clamp down on the opposition by unleashing increasingly aggressive police tactics against dissidents. Mariana Zu\u00f1iga and Anthony Faiola report: \u201cAs the opposition campaign to oust him dramatically escalated, the warren-like streets of the Puerta Caracas slum filled with pot-banging, anti-government demonstrators. A culture center run by Maduro loyalists was burned down. Hungry, beaten-down residents felt a rush of hope. Then night fell, along with the boot steps of government forces. Maduro called the arsonists 'fascist criminals,' and residents in the western Caracas enclave paid the price. Mask-wearing special forces, locals said, swarmed the neighborhood last week, kicking in doors, rounding up young people and imposing an effective curfew. \u2026 Over the past week, similar operations have extended to at least five other rebellious slums across the capital, leaving 35 people dead \u2014 including victims as young as 16 \u2014 and more than 850 arrested.\u201d -- Critics of the Trump White House say Bolton\u2019s display of a note indicating the possible deployment of U.S. troops to Colombia is indicative of the administration\u2019s careless handling of sensitive matters. From David Nakamura: \u201cRevealing private notes, including [President George W.] Bush\u2019s request for\u00a0a \u2018bathroom break\u2019\u00a0at the United Nations in 2005, have bedeviled past presidents \u2014 but rarely with the frequency of the Trump White House. Obama\u2019s White House photographer, Pete Souza, occasionally posted photos of marked-up presidential addresses, but those were\u00a0carefully curated\u00a0to cast the president as a thoughtful writer and editor. Bolton\u2019s appearance in the briefing room \u2014 just days after\u00a0photographers snapped senior aide Stephen Miller\u2019s notes, including the underlined term \u2018Radical Democrats,\u2019 during a White House meeting \u2014 was something of a flashback to the earliest days of the administration.\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\u00a0meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang. (Valery Sharifulin\/AFP\/Getty Images) THERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Russia attempted to interfere last year in U.S.-North Korean nuclear negotiations by offering Pyongyang a nuclear power plant in exchange for destroying its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. John Hudson and Ellen Nakashima report: \u201cThe Russian offer, which intelligence officials became aware of in late 2018, marked a new attempt by Moscow to intervene in the high-stakes nuclear talks as it reasserts itself in a string of geopolitical flash points from the Middle East to South Asia to Latin America. It\u2019s unclear how [Trump] will view Moscow\u2019s proposal. For months, he has embraced an unorthodox approach to the negotiations, but his aides are likely to strenuously oppose any major Russian role in a final agreement.\u201d -- Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin for several minutes during November\u2019s G-20 summit without a note-taker or translator from the U.S. side, according to the Financial Times\u2019s James Politi, Demetri Sevastopulo and Henry Foy. \u201cThe discussions between the US and Russian presidents occurred at the 19th-century Col\u00f3n theatre in the Argentine capital, as world leaders and their spouses or guests were streaming out of the building. Mr Trump was accompanied by Melania Trump, his wife, but no staff, while Mr Putin was flanked by his translator. The four of them sat at a table and were among the last to leave. \u2026 Mr Trump\u2019s aides characterised the Putin encounter as one of several \u2018informal\u2019 conversations that Mr Trump had with his counterparts that evening. \u201cThe accounts of people familiar with the conversation said it appeared longer and more substantive than the White House has acknowledged. According to a Russian government official\u2019s account, the two leaders spoke for about 15 minutes about a number of foreign policy issues, including the Azov Sea incident\u00a0and the conflict in Syria. They also discussed when they could have a formal meeting, the official said.\u00a0Mr Trump explained that a full meeting with Mr Putin was impossible at the time, and the Russian leader responded by saying he \u2018was not in a hurry\u2019 and remained ready to meet when it suited Mr Trump best, the Russian official said.\u201d -- Moscow is advancing a plan to stop punishing officials for \u201cunavoidable\u201d bribes. The Moscow Times reports: \u201cPutin proposed the measure in an anti-corruption plan signed in June 2018 that called for legislation that would allow officials to escape prosecution for corruption under \u2018exceptional circumstances.\u2019 \u2026 The amendments drafted by the Justice Ministry seek to exempt officials from legal accountability when corruption is unavoidable. \u2018In certain circumstances, complying with restrictions and bans ... to prevent or settle conflicts of interests \u2026 is impossible for objective reasons,\u2019 the draft bill on the government's legal portal says.\u201d -- Split-screen: Leaders of the intelligence community, all appointed by Trump, said Russia and China represent two of the most significant national security threats during Senate testimony in which they repeatedly offered assessments starkly at odds with the president\u2019s public posturing. Shane Harris reports: \u201cThe two U.S. adversaries \u2018are more aligned than at any point since the mid-1950s,\u2019 Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats said in his prepared remarks before the Senate Intelligence Committee. ... The countries have expanded cooperation in the energy sector over the past half decade; influenced international bodies that set rules and standards, particularly around communications technology; and will collaborate on the shared goal of \u2018taking advantage of rising doubts in some places about the liberal democratic model,\u2019 Coats warned. CIA Director Gina Haspel, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray and other top officials joined Coats.\u201d (They were there to discuss the new National Intelligence Strategy, which I wrote about last week.) -- Here are five of the main issues where the intelligence community leaders broke with Trump: -- \u201cThe disconnect between [Trump] and the Republican establishment on foreign policy has rarely been as stark,\u201d the New York Times\u2019s Peter Baker notes. \u201cIn recent days, the president\u2019s own advisers and allies have been pushing back, challenging his view of the world and his prescription for its problems. The growing discontent among Republican national security hawks was most evident on Tuesday when [Mitch McConnell] effectively rebuked the president by introducing a measure denouncing \u2018a precipitous withdrawal\u2019\u00a0of American troops from Syria and Afghanistan.\u201d THE INVESTIGATIONS: -- Roger Stone pleaded not guilty to the charges laid out by special counsel Bob Mueller. Spencer S. Hsu, Ann E. Marimow and Devlin Barrett report: \u201cHe faces charges of lying, obstruction and witness tampering. Asked Tuesday whether he would consider pardoning Stone, [Trump] told The Washington Post, \u2018I have not given it any thought.\u2019 \u2026 As Stone walked into the courthouse Tuesday morning, some onlookers chanted \u2018lock him up!\u2019 while others screamed their support for him and the president. After he went inside the courthouse, some of those people engaged in profanity-laced arguments about the case. \u2026 In the courtroom Tuesday, prosecutors said the Stone case would be tried jointly by Mueller\u2019s office and the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and asked for no change to the terms of Stone\u2019s release set by a Florida judge Friday. \u2026 The judge agreed with those conditions and scheduled the next court hearing for Feb. 1.\u201d -- The Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s planned vote on William Barr\u2019s nomination as attorney general was delayed amid Democratic concerns about how he would handle the Mueller probe. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cThe delay, which is customary for high-profile nominations, is not expected to impede Barr\u2019s chances of being confirmed by the full Senate. But it is the latest reflection of the deep partisan tension surrounding Barr\u2019s nomination, most of which centers on Democrats\u2019 desire to protect Mueller\u2019s probe from being unduly constrained. The committee was scheduled to vote on 46 nominations on Tuesday, including Barr\u2019s, but decided to delay until Feb. 7.\u201d -- House Democrats raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest in Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u2019s decision to lift sanctions on the businesses of Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The New York Times\u2019s Kenneth P. Vogel reports: \u201cIn a letter to Mr. Mnuchin, two senior Democratic lawmakers said the Treasury secretary\u2019s connection to an entertainment business owned in part by [a billionaire Republican] donor, Len Blavatnik, a major investor in Mr. Deripaska\u2019s giant aluminum company, Rusal, was a potential conflict of interest. \u2026 Tony Sayegh, the Treasury Department\u2019s assistant secretary for public affairs, said that Mr. Mnuchin had \u2018no business relationship\u2019 with Mr. Blavatnik and that any implication of a conflict of interest or ethical problem was \u2018absurd.\u2019\u201d -- The Justice Department's inspector general wants to investigate Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta\u2019s role in securing a cushy plea deal for alleged serial sex offender Jeffrey Epstein while Acosta was serving as a federal prosecutor in Florida.\u00a0But he's currently barred from doing so. Bloomberg Law\u2019s Chris Opfer and Jaclyn Diaz report: \u201c\u2018Your letter raises important questions about the resolution of this case by department attorneys,\u2019 DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz said in a Jan. 29 letter to lawmakers. \u2018However, the OIG does not currently have jurisdiction over matters involving allegations of misconduct relating to DOJ attorneys\u2019 handling of litigation or legal decisions.\u2019 \u2026 Horowitz called on the Senate to take up a bill (H.R. 202) recently passed by the House. He said that legislation would give him the authority to investigate alleged prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d -- The first meeting of the new House Oversight Committee, which will oversee investigations of the Trump administration, featured fireworks between Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Bloomberg News\u2019s Billy House reports: \u201cMeadows and other Republicans were telling Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland that members should get more than three days\u2019 notice to attend questioning of witnesses by Democratic staff lawyers. Meadows said five days was better, particularly for lawmakers who live far from Washington. Ocasio-Cortez wasted no time in offering her first remarks on the committee. \u2018I don\u2019t believe we need five days\u2019 if lawmakers are doing their jobs, she responded. Meadows wasn\u2019t going to let that go. Formally directing his remarks to Cummings, he responded: \u2018Mr. Chairman, I can tell you on all of this at this particular point, we\u2019re all wanting to cooperate.\u2019 But he said, \u2018Sometimes our schedules, you know, we\u2019re not just sitting around eating bonbons, waiting for the call of anybody.\u2019 Ocasio-Cortez then asked Cummings whether Republicans gave members ample notice for such matters during the last congressional session, when they ran the committee. \u2018No,\u2019 said Cummings, of Maryland. \u2018OK, thank you,\u2019 said Ocasio-Cortez.\u201d THE IMMIGRATION WARS: -- The Trump Organization plans to verify\u00a0employees\u2019 immigration status following a Post report that one of the president\u2019s golf clubs hired undocumented immigrants for years. Jonathan O'Connell, Elise Viebeck and Tracy Jan report: \u201c\u2018We are instituting E-Verify on all of our properties as soon as possible,\u2019 Eric Trump, one of the president\u2019s sons and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said Tuesday, acknowledging that the company currently uses the program only at some locations. \u2026 The move is the first acknowledgment by the president\u2019s private business that it has failed to fully check the work status of all its employees, despite Trump\u2019s claims during the 2016 campaign that he used E-Verify across his properties. At the time, he called for the program to be mandatory for all employers. The decision by the Trump Organization is not likely to head off calls for an investigation by congressional Democrats, who on Tuesday began gathering signatures for a letter to FBI Director [Wray] seeking a probe into whether the president\u2019s company broke the law by hiring undocumented workers.\u201d -- The United States started instituting its new policy of forcing asylum seekers at the southern border to wait in Mexico as their cases are processed. Maya Averbuch and Kevin Sieff report: \u201cHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen planned to visit the San Ysidro port of entry later in the day to \u2018assess implementation\u2019 of the new approach, according to a DHS statement. \u2026 The return of [a] Honduran asylum seeker Tuesday appeared to be ad hoc; he was rushed to a van by a Mexican immigration agent with no formal announcement of when \u00adothers would follow. Rodulfo Figueroa, the national migration agency\u2019s representative in Tijuana, said no others would be released Tuesday.\u201d -- The Pentagon intends to send thousands more U.S. troops to the southern border. Dan Lamothe reports: \u201cActing defense secretary Patrick M. Shanahan told reporters at the Pentagon that the evolving mission will focus heavily on watching the border for potential threats. It will mark the latest shift in how active-duty troops are used on the border, and nudge the number from about 2,300 active-duty service members closer to a high-water mark of about 5,900 that were involved in November. An additional 2,300 national guardsmen also are deployed to the border mission.\u201d -- Following the shutdown, Democrats have taken a rare polling lead over Trump on border security. From Aaron Blake: \u201cA\u00a0new Quinnipiac University poll\u00a0finds Americans trust Democrats more than Trump on border security, 50 percent to 41 percent. That is up from a 49-to-44 Democratic advantage two weeks ago. Both findings are rare since the issue has almost always favored the GOP. As recently as November, a\u00a0Washington Post-ABC News poll found people favored Republicans to Democrats on the issue of border security by nearly the opposite margin, 49 to 39.\u201d A SECOND SHUTDOWN? -- Republican lawmakers proposed a debt-ceiling increase as one component of a possible deal in their frantic efforts to avoid another government shutdown. Robert Costa and Erica Werner report: \u201cThe latest idea to tack on an increase in the nation\u2019s borrowing limit to discussions over Trump\u2019s demand for $5.7 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall divided Republicans and was immediately rejected by Democrats, a less-than-promising development on the eve of congressional negotiators\u2019 first meeting. \u2018I don\u2019t want to sink the whole thing,\u2019 Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said when asked about the flurry of proposals by her colleagues. Still, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump ally, and others worked to nudge a bipartisan group of lawmakers toward including a debt-limit hike, hoping to avoid another shutdown in mid-February when funding expires as well as a market-rattling showdown over the nation\u2019s debt. \u2026 \u201cMost Republicans are now eager to avoid another shutdown, due to the political fallout they have endured in polls, which show a majority of Americans blaming Trump and the GOP for the standoff. [Mitch McConnell], who has been cautious, said Tuesday, \u2018I\u2019m for whatever works, which means avoiding a shutdown and avoiding the president feeling he should declare a national emergency.\u2019 \u2026 The suggestions \u2014 which also included spending restrictions and protections for young undocumented immigrants as part of a broader pact \u2014 complicated the path ahead for the committee of 17 lawmakers charged with coming up with a spending deal to stave off another shutdown Feb. 15.\u201d -- The lowest-paid government contractors are still feeling the impact\u00a0of the first shutdown. Danielle Paquette reports: \u201cUnlike the 800,000 career public servants who are slated to receive full back pay over the next week or so, the contractors who clean, guard, cook and shoulder other jobs at federal workplaces aren\u2019t legally guaranteed a single penny. They\u2019re also among the lowest-paid laborers in the government economy, generally earning between $450 and $650 weekly, union leaders say. \u2026 H\u00e9ctor Figueroa, president of 32BJ SEIU, a labor union that represents 170,000 service workers on the East Coast, said reopening the government is a temporary fix for people on such shaky ground.\u201d -- Officials at Mount Rainier National Park worked to cut through five weeks\u2019 worth of snow that built up during the shutdown. Lornet Turnbull reports: \u201cIt\u2019s likely to take at least two days to clear, leaving huge snowbanks around the perimeter. Road crews and other staff members at Mount Rainier National Park are scrambling to reopen this iconic volcanic mountain to the public, more than a month after the partial federal government shutdown cut off official access to some of its most popular wintertime activities. The park lost 10 percent of its working year, Superintendent Chip Jenkins laments. And while Paradise might begin welcoming visitors by next weekend, there is bigger concern about the long-term effect those lost days could have on the crucial summer season.\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti speaks during a news conference in Los Angeles. (Jae C. Hong\/AP) 2020 WATCH: -- Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that he would not seek the Democratic presidential nomination. The LA Times\u2019s Michael Finnegan and Dakota Smith report: \u201cAfter nearly two years of flirting with the idea that he could leap from City Hall to the world\u2019s most powerful job, the mild-mannered mayor reached a decision in keeping with his reputation for avoiding political risk. He also passed up a chance to run for governor last year when the odds seemed stacked against him. At a City Hall news conference, Garcetti said he decided over the last couple of weeks to stay put as mayor because he \u2018realized that this is what I am meant to do and this is where I want to be.\u2019\u201d -- One possible\u00a0beneficiary of Garcetti\u2019s decision: Sen. Kamala\u00a0Harris, who may now become the only high-profile presidential candidate from California. From the San Francisco Chronicle\u2019s Joe Garofoli: \u201cSince California\u2019s primary will be held on March 3, 2020 \u2014 far earlier in than in many past election cycles \u2014 it could have an outsized impact on whom the party\u2019s nominee will be. \u2018It\u2019s always easy to be the favorite daughter when there\u2019s no favorite son,\u2019 said Thad Kousser, a professor of political science at UC San Diego and author of \u2018The New Political Geography of California.\u2019 \u2018If I were Kamala, I\u2019d be giddy,\u2019 said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a retired professor of public policy communication at the University of Southern California. Among other things, \u2018Harris and Garcetti were hitting a lot of the same Democratic donors,\u2019 she said.\u201d -- Harris\u2019s acknowledgement that\u00a0Medicare-for-all would also mean private insurance for none underscores the risks for 2020 Democrats who have chosen to embrace it. Annie Linskey\u00a0reports on the fallout: \u201cIn a single flourish, Harris drew attention to the fact that the Medicare-for-all plans backed by 16 senators \u2014 including five potential candidates for the Democratic nomination \u2014 would in effect remove private health insurance from the estimated 251 million Americans who use it, broadly disrupting the industry and the way Americans experience the medical system. \u2026 \u201cCandidates can point to evidence that there\u2019s popular support for the idea. Fifty-six percent of respondents backed a Medicare-for-all plan, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey. \u2026 But enthusiasm for the idea plummets when respondents are told the plan would largely eliminate private health insurance companies: Only 37 percent favor eliminating private insurance. And nearly 70 percent of those surveyed in a Gallup report released in December said they think their health coverage is either \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018excellent.\u2019\u201d -- Harris\u2019s team tried to clean up the senator's comments. CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg, Tami Luhby and Maeve Reston report: \u201cA\u00a0Harris adviser on Tuesday signaled that the candidate would also be open to the more moderate health reform plans, which would preserve the industry, being floated by other congressional Democrats ...\u00a0Both the adviser and Harris national press secretary Ian Sams said her willingness to consider alternate routes to a single payer system should not cast doubt on her commitment to the policy.\u201d -- \u201cThe unique harm we cause when we dissect a powerful woman\u2019s love life,\u201d by Monica Hesse: \u201cThe candidate in question [Harris], whose past relationship with former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown was confirmed for the national media when Brown\u00a0published an op-ed: Yes, they\u2019d dated. And, yes, he \u2018may have influenced her career\u2019 by appointing her to two commissions. \u2026 The two things were separate, according to Brown. 1) They dated. 2) He helped her career. The latter didn\u2019t have anything to do with the former. Whether you believe that probably depends on whether you believe one can separate someone\u2019s professional qualifications from their dinner companionship. \u2026 [I]t\u2019s not that we don\u2019t talk about the sexual predilections of male candidates. But we do talk about them in a different way. We talk about men abusing power. We talk about women not even deserving power. The distinction matters, because the conversation isn\u2019t really about sex, it\u2019s about legitimacy.\u201d Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) greets supporters in Honolulu. (Marco Garcia\/AP) -- Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s presidential campaign has already spiraled out of control, and the vanity project now threatens to cost the Hawaii Democrat her House seat.\u00a0Politico\u2019s Daniel Strauss and Alex Thompson report: \u201cTwo-and-a-half weeks after she told CNN she had decided to run for the White House\u2014an announcement that even her own staff didn't know was coming, after weeks of debating the timing of the rollout\u2014the 37-year-old congresswoman has struggled to contain the chaos. Campaign manager Rania Batrice and Gabbard\u2019s consulting firm Revolution Messaging are set to depart after this weekend\u2019s official kickoff in Hawaii \u2026 Meanwhile, the congresswoman is under fire back home after picking a fight with Sen. Mazie Hirono (D), and a prominent Democratic state lawmaker is already challenging Gabbard in next year\u2019s congressional primary. That means she faces the possibility of losing the presidential race and her House seat as well.\u201d -- Howard Schultz is facing intense blowback over\u00a0his potential independent presidential campaign.\u00a0But the former Starbucks CEO has spent months preparing the unconventional bid. Michael Scherer reports: \u201c[Schultz deployed] more than six national polls and [laid] the groundwork for paid advertising that could debut in the next two months. The full reach of the project suggests that his stated goal of disrupting the U.S. political process is not likely to fade away anytime soon, despite enormous historical barriers to success and Democratic predictions that his entry in the race will help [Trump] get reelected. An early advertising effort, made possible by Schultz\u2019s net worth of about $3.4 billion, would be designed to help Schultz show early promise in national polls during his book tour, which he has described as a time to test the appeal of his ideas.\u201d -- Schultz further attracted Democratic\u00a0ire by belittling the policy positions of Elizabeth Warren, Harris and Ocasio-Cortez. John Wagner reports: \u201cDuring an interview Tuesday on NPR\u2019s \u2018Morning Edition,\u2019 Schultz, a billionaire, said that Warren\u2019s plan for a special 2 percent annual tax on Americans whose net worth exceeds $50 million is \u2018ridiculous.\u2019 \u2026 The exchange came just a few hours after Schultz called Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) \u2018a bit misinformed\u2019 and pushed back on her idea of a top marginal tax rate of 70 percent. \u2026 Schultz also knocked the views of a policy adviser to Ocasio-Cortez as \u2018un-American.\u2019\u201d Schultz also referred to Harris\u2019s comments on \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d as \u201cnot American.\u201d -- Former senator Jeff Flake ruled out a possible primary challenge against Trump in 2020. \u201cI have always said that I do hope that there is a Republican who challenges the president in the primary,\u201d Flake told \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d \u201cI still hope that somebody does, but that somebody won\u2019t be me. I will not be a candidate.\u201d (John Wagner) Cliff Sims, then director of White House Message Strategy, stands with Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer as they listen to President Trump speak on the South Lawn in June 2017. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais\/AP) WEST WING INTRIGUE: -- Trump lashed out against former White House aide Cliff Sims and may have inadvertently helped sell more copies of Sims\u2019s new book. CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter reports: \u201c\u2018A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories and fiction,\u2019 Trump said in his tweet. \u2026 At the time of the Tuesday morning tweet, \u2018Team of Vipers\u2019 was No. 12 on Amazon's best selling books list. The rankings are updated every hour. \u2018Vipers\u2019 has been moving up the list ever since, and as of Tuesday afternoon, it stands at No. 6. Of course, it's impossible to know how much of the sales momentum is due to Trump, and how much is due to other factors like Sims' TV appearances. \u2026 But Trump's post triggered a brand new news cycle about Sims' depictions of a distracted president and a distrustful inner circle of aides.\u201d -- Sims pushed back against claims he was fired from his role. The New York Times\u2019s Annie Karni and Maggie Haberman report: \u201cAnticipating pushback from the White House, he told George Stephanopoulos, the host [of \u2018Good Morning America\u2019], that he had brought his resignation letter along to prove it. White House aides have been telling reporters for weeks that Mr. Sims was fired, but did not want to comment about him on the record. A former official noted that Mr. Sims was \u2018instructed to leave due to a major security breach\u2019 \u2014 a reference to what Mr. Sims said was the time he recorded [Trump] in the White House on his government phone and then emailed those files to himself, but insisted that was not the reason he left.\u201d -- In an interview with the New Yorker, Sims said he was still \u201cproud\u201d of working for the Trump administration and seemed largely unfazed by Trump\u2019s most controversial positions. Of birtherism, Sims said, \u201cI think that\u2019s, like, a great example of a time where he does not step up to the plate and take on these race issues in an appropriate way, a helpful way for the country.\u201d When asked whether he would have left the administration during the implementation of migrant family separations, Sims replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. Maybe.\u201d He added when discussing the Charlottesville fallout, \u201cI really don\u2019t think there is a racist bone in [Trump\u2019s] body.\u201d (New Yorker) -- Chris Christie, who is on his own book tour, described Jared Kushner as the most influential person in the White House. \u201cHe's not the only person who [Trump] listens to, but I don't think anyone has more influence than Jared has,\u201d the former New Jersey governor told NPR.

But you should get to know him, because you\u2019re going to be hearing his name a lot in the near future. With more attention turning to President Trump\u2019s business and the legal problems it could cause him, Weisselberg will be at the center of the story. In fact, there is probably not a single person who knows more about the ethical transgressions, shady dealings and broken laws that President Trump has left in his wake.We know about Weisselberg\u2019s direct involvement in the coverup of Trump\u2019s alleged affair with Stormy Daniels, but what we still have to learn is what he can tell us about the rest of Trump\u2019s business practices \u2014 not just when it comes to his domestic dealings, but to his foreign dealings as well. Weisselberg is the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, giving him responsibility for all its finances. He has handled the president\u2019s money for Trump\u2019s entire professional life, since 1973, as Trump biographer Timothy O\u2019Brien has detailed.  There is virtually no one who seriously believes that Trump conducts his business in an aboveboard manner, and Weisselberg is almost certainly party to it all. Adam Davidson of the New Yorker puts it this way: \u201cJournalists who cover Trump\u2019s finances have heard, from source after source, some variation of \u2018I don\u2019t know, but Allen does\u2019 about questions regarding Trump\u2019s unorthodox accounting practices.\u201d Weisselberg was granted limited immunity by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York to testify to a grand jury in connection with its investigation of campaign finance violations related to the hush money paid in 2016 to Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. That scheme is part of the reason Cohen is headed to prison. This came up in dramatic fashion at Cohen\u2019s testimony Wednesday, when he explained that he and Weisselberg decided to disguise Trump\u2019s reimbursement of the Daniels hush money as legal services. Cohen would submit invoices and then be paid, so that it looked like a legitimate expense. That was itself fraudulent, but if Trump himself or the Trump Organization deducted those payments, that could also constitute tax fraud. Indeed, this constitutes another good reason to pursue Trump\u2019s tax returns. As for who signed the checks, \u201cIt would either be Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and\/or Allen Weisselberg \u2014 but always Allen Weisselberg on the check,\u201d Cohen said. He produced one such check for the committee, with signatures from Don Jr. and Weisselberg. Here\u2019s an exchange he had with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) that\u2019s worth highlighting: KHANNA: I just want the American public to understand the explosive nature of your testimony and this document. Are you telling us, Mr. Cohen, that the president directed transactions in conspiracy with Allen Weisselberg and his son, Donald Trump Jr. \u2026 as part of a criminal conspiracy of financial fraud, is that your testimony today? COHEN: Yes. KHANNA: And do you know if this criminal financial scheme that the president, Allen Weisselberg and Donald Trump Jr. are involved in is being investigated by the Southern District of New York? COHEN: I\u2019d rather not discuss that question because it could be part of an investigation that is currently ongoing. The hush money payments are their own somewhat self-contained scandal. But Cohen also testified that Trump engaged in all manner of shady gaming of his assets. Those actions could potentially be criminal, and as CFO, Weisselberg would have been directly involved in preparing the documents. Unlike almost anyone, he knows the true value of Trump\u2019s holdings. Indeed, Cohen flatly confirmed that Weisselberg is the go-to person on this sort of thing. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) asked Cohen who could shed light on Trump\u2019s history of gaming assets for both insurance and tax avoidance purposes. In both cases, Cohen\u2019s answer included the words: \u201cAllen Weisselberg.\u201d Weisselberg and the House Intelligence Committee And that\u2019s not all. The House Intelligence Committee plans to bring Weisselberg in to testify. What could Weisselberg provide when it comes to intelligence-related matters? Well, a Democratic aide familiar with committee chairman Rep. Adam B. Schiff\u2019s (D-Calif.) plans tells us that the answer to this question lies in points three and four of the document Schiff recently released that details questions he hopes to answer with his planned Russia investigation. Those read: (3) Whether any foreign actor has sought to compromise or holds leverage, financial or otherwise, over Donald Trump, his family, his business, or his associates; (4) Whether President Trump, his family, or his associates are or were at any time at heightened risk of, or vulnerable to, foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, or have sought to influence U.S. government policy in service of foreign interests; According to the aide, Schiff hopes to ask Weisselberg for information that sheds light on those questions. In other words, Schiff hopes Weisselberg will open a window on whether Trump\u2019s overseas dealings have created conflicts of interest or have made him or his family members vulnerable to foreign blackmail. \u201cThis suggests that Schiff believes that Weisselberg is well situated to have insights into the Trump Organization and Trump family\u2019s financial situation, and any foreign ties that would create improper leverage,\u201d former U.S. attorney Barb McQuade tells us. \u201cFor a prosecutor, Weisselberg is a dream witness. He\u2019s uniquely and perfectly positioned to have valuable information.\u201d When it comes to Allen Weisselberg, we have many more questions than answers. It\u2019s somewhat remarkable, given his central role in the Trump Organization, that we haven\u2019t been able to get those answers up until now. Weisselberg obviously would be prefer to stay silent and behind the scenes. But he won\u2019t be able to do that for much longer.","113":"NEW YORK \u2014 Lyft is growing quickly ahead of its initial public offering but continues to bleed money and may struggle to turn a profit as it tries to catch up to Uber in the booming ride-hailing market, according to a federal filing. The company released its financial details for the first time on Friday, giving the public a glimpse into its performance before deciding whether to buy into a transportation trend that has changed the way tens of millions of people get around. The unveiling came nearly three months after the San Francisco company filed confidential documents for its initial public offering of stock. Lyft reported $2.2 billion in revenue last year \u2014 more than double its $1.1 billion in revenue in 2017. That continued a growth trajectory that saw revenue more than triple in 2017 compared with 2016, when the company brought in $343.3 million. But Lyft is still losing money and its executives warned it may struggle to turn a profit, according to Friday\u2019s filing. The company lost $911 million last year, bringing its total losses to nearly $3 billion since 2012 while raking in $5.1 billion in venture capital. Its cash balance also is shrinking. Lyft had $517 million in cash and equivalents at the end of last year, about half of what it had at the end of 2017. The IPO will enable the company to raise more cash to finance its operations and expand while management tries to figure out way to turn a profit. The next step for Lyft will be to meet with potential investors during presentations known as a \u201croad show\u201d on Wall Street, then determine how much stock it will sell in the IPO and how much to demand for its shares. If all goes smoothly, Lyft\u2019s stock market debut will likely occur in late March or early April. Lyft has been in a race with Uber to be first to offer its stock to the public, and has positioned itself as the affable alternative to its larger and more ubiquitous rival. Uber, which struggled with public relations setbacks in the past, expects to file its IPO later this year. Together, the two could raise billions of dollars to fuel their expansions and give investors an opportunity to see how the companies plan to become sustainable. Lyft\u2019s filing says that its co-founders \u2014 CEO Logan Green, 35, and President John Zimmer, 34 \u2014 will keep significant control of the company after it goes public and \u201cwill be able to significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders,\u201d including the election of board members, a merger, asset sales or other major corporate transactions. The company\u2019s share of the U.S. ride-hailing market was 39 percent in December 2018, up from 22 percent in December 2016, according to the filing, which cited growth from new drivers and riders as well as increased ride frequency. It reported 30.7 million riders and 1.9 million drivers in more than 300 cities in 2018, and has given more than 1 billion rides since its inception in 2012, according to the filing. Lyft\u2019s market-share gains in recent years came at a time when Uber was dogged by reports that drivers accosted passengers and that the company allowed rampant sexual harassment internally \u2014 revelations that ultimately led its co-founder Travis Kalanick to resign. Uber has been working to repair its image under CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who tweeted congratulations to the Lyft team Friday, calling it \u201ca big moment for ridesharing!\u201d Lyft allowed customers to tip drivers earlier than Uber, building into its brand the sense that it treats drivers better than its main competitor. In its filing, Lyft said it will pay cash bonuses of $1,000 and $10,000 to drivers who meet certain criteria, and that drivers may use those bonuses to buy the company\u2019s shares. Bookings, a figure representing Lyft\u2019s fares after subtracting taxes, tolls and tips, have been rising dramatically \u2014 a trend that the company intends to underscore in its presentation to potential investors. Lyft\u2019s bookings surpassed $8 billion last year, 76 percent more than in 2017 and more than four times the number from 2016. The company\u2019s revenue of $2.2 billion last year represents Lyft\u2019s slice of the bookings. \u201cWe believe this is a key indicator of the utility of transportation solutions provided through our multimodal platform, as well as the scale and growth in our business,\u201d the company said in the filing. Lyft, known for the pink moustaches that used to adorn car grilles, was valued at just over $15 billion last year. In addition to ride-hailing, it offers shared car, bike and scooter rides. By being the first company in the ride-hailing category to go public, Lyft is likely to attract institutional investors who want to get in on the sector, said Rohit Kulkarni, senior vice president of research at Forge. Based on the figures in the filing, and assuming steady revenue growth of more than 50 percent in the next year, institutional investors are likely to value Lyft at $20 billion to $25 billion, he said. The next step is for Lyft managers to go on the road to woo investors, presenting details and fielding questions from potential buyers in hopes of drumming up interest. That will help the company determine the price of its shares when it goes public, likely in late March or early April. \u201cLyft has clearly demonstrated progress along its pathway to profitability ... but the key question is whether Lyft can accelerate its pathway to profitability,\u201d Kulkarni said. \u201cOn its upcoming roadshow, public equity investors would have a lot of tough questions for Lyft\u2019s management on this topic.\u201d In its risk assessments, Lyft outlined the difficulty of attracting and retaining drivers and riders \u201cin a cost-effective manner,\u201d complying with laws and regulations, and being able to manage growth and expand beyond the U.S. and part of Canada. The company conceded that it has lost money since it started in mid-2012 and its expenses are increasing as it launches new services. \u201cWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future,\u201d the company said. Lyft also said it faces intense competition and could lose market share to competitors. The company acknowledged the importance of developing autonomous vehicle technology on its own or with partners. Uber \u2014 as well as Waymo, General Motors and others \u2014 is working on self-driving vehicles, which they expect to enter the ride-hailing business. If they are able to do that, and Lyft is still relying on drivers, its cost of giving rides likely would be far higher. Despite competing with Lyft, General Motors and Alphabet \u2014 Waymo\u2019s parent company \u2014 each own more than 5 percent of Lyft\u2019s Class A common stock, according to the filing. ___ Krisher reported from Detroit and Liedtke reported from San Francisco. ___ This story has been corrected to read that Lyft\u2019s cash on hand in 2018 was $517 million, not $517,690.","114":"THE PROGNOSIS House Ways and Means Committee Chairman\u00a0Richard Neal (D-Mass.). (Jose Luis Magana\/AP) A crop of new health insurance plans enabled under regulations from the Trump administration appears more consumer-friendly and less like \u201cjunk\u201d insurance than Democrats originally\u00a0charged. Chambers of commerce and trade associations have launched more than two dozen of these \u201cassociation health plans\u201d in 13 states\u00a0in the seven months since the Labor Department finalized new rules making it easier for small businesses to band together to buy health coverage in the same way large employers do. And there are initial signs the plans are offering generous benefits and premiums lower than can be found in the Obamacare marketplaces. President Trump billed the\u00a0new rules\u00a0as one of several ways to provide consumers with cheaper coverage options than they could find in the Obamacare marketplaces, prompting complaints by Democrats that he was undermining consumer protections laid out in the Affordable Care Act. There\u2019s indeed plenty of evidence the administration is trying to weaken the\u00a0ACA, including the Justice Department\u2019s refusal to defend it in court. But when it comes to these new association health plans, they appear \u2014 at least so far \u2014 to offer benefits comparable to most workplace plans and haven't tried to discriminate against patients with preexisting conditions, according to an analysis released today by Kev Coleman, a former analyst at the insurance information website HealthPocket. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing skinny plans,\u201d said Coleman, who founded a\u00a0website\u00a0last year with information on association health plans. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the regular doctor care, we\u2019re seeing emergency room care, we\u2019re seeing mental health coverage.\u201d The farm cooperative Land O\u2019Lakes, which is expanding its association plan to farmers in Nebraska and Minnesota, has said its\u00a0premiums will cost 25 percent to 35 percent less than\u00a0plans sold on Nebraska\u2019s ACA marketplace. Every category of essential health benefits \u2014 which are required for marketplace plans \u2014 is covered, according to an analysis by Modern Healthcare. Several\u00a0business associations in Nevada have started offering association health plans to member companies. Enrollees in the plan offered by the Reno-Sparks Chamber of Commerce have cited lower deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. Two of Michigan\u2019s largest business associations are partnering to offer members association plans managed by BlueCross BlueShield of Michigan, some of which will cover essential health benefits and offer different premium and deductible levels. According to Coleman, who analyzed 28 association health plans operating under the new rules, a majority of the new association plans are being launched by regional chambers of commerce,\u00a0four\u00a0out of five are being managed by a third-party insurance company, and half the plans offer tax-free savings account options. Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.). (J. Scott Applewhite\/AP) The idea behind expanding association health plans was to make more widely available the type of coverage often offered to employees of big companies. Small businesses have typically struggled to provide affordable coverage for workers, given the small size of their risk pools. The new regulations allow small businesses, associations and self-employed individuals \u2014 including those operating in different industries \u2013 to band together to buy health coverage by pooling all of their employees together. The health consulting firm Avalere has estimated 3.2 million\u00a0people could eventually be covered by such plans, which have to comply with the same rules governing large employer plans.\u00a0 The association plans don\u2019t have to cover the essential health benefits required of plans purchased by individuals in the ACA marketplaces \u2014\u00a0something Democrats have been quick to note. Analysts have also warned that they'll cause marketplace premiums to increase by as much as 3.5 percent, by drawing healthy people away from Obamacare plans and into association coverage. But what\u2019s sometimes been lost in heated, politicized exchanges\u00a0is that the Labor Department did ban these plans from discriminating against patients with preexisting conditons.\u00a0That\u00a0perhaps reflects\u00a0a growing realization among Republicans that opposing these popular protections is a political loser. Democrats'\u00a0claims that association plans\u00a0constitute \u201cjunk\u201d insurance aren\u2019t necessarily true. That\u2019s because the\u00a0 plans are subject to the same requirements currently in place for large employer plans, including requirements to fully cover preventive care and bans on limiting annual and lifetime benefits. Republicans strove to highlight association health plans in a contentious Capitol Hill hearing Tuesday.\u00a0Ways and Means Democrats spent their time bashing GOP lawmakers for trying so long and hard to knock down the ACA and its protections for people with preexisting conditions. For their single witness, Republicans brought in Rob Robertson, chief administrator of the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation. The organization for farmers and ranchers is offering an association health plan it says will cost 25 percent less than plans currently offered in the state\u2019s individual market and will cover a broad range of benefits including prescription drugs, emergency room visits and prenatal and maternity care. The plan won\u2019t discriminate against people with preexisting conditions, Robertson said. That\u2019s now a point of emphasis for Republicans, who spent last year\u2019s midterm elections on the defensive\u00a0as Democrats accused them of abandoning people with serious medical conditions and drawing attention to a GOP-led state lawsuit against the ACA that could dismantle those protections. \u201cI say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, take \u2018yes\u2019 for an answer,\u201d Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) said. \u201cWe agree with you. This reform is good;\u00a0this reform will stay as the law of the land.\u201d But even if association health plans ultimately prove\u00a0successful \u2014 and it\u2019s too early to say for sure \u2014 Republicans face a harsh reality on health-care policy. After years of slamming the ACA but failing to come up with a viable alternative, they\u2019re now stuck in a defensive posture as energized Democrats leveraged the issue to their favor in 2018 and seek to do the same in 2020. \u201cThey get that preexisting conditions must be protected,\u201d Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.) said sarcastically\u00a0in remarks aimed at his colleagues on the other end of the dais. \u201cThey hear the message \u2014 it only took years;\u00a0it only took hundreds of millions of dollars of campaign commercials.\u201d House Budget Committee Chairman\u00a0John Yarmuth (D-Ky.). (Jacquelyn Martin\/AP) AHH: House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said the party will begin holding hearings in the spring on expanding Medicare\u00a0-- the\u00a0latest signal that Democratic lawmakers want to move forward with discussing\u00a0a national health-care program. In an interview with Reuters\u2019s\u00a0Yasmeen Abutaleb and Susan Cornwell, Yarmuth said a \u201cmajority\u201d in the party wants to \u201cdo something, some kind of Medicare expansion. I\u2019ve had a number of major corporate CEOS say to me we need to go to Medicare for All.\u201d Yarmuth cited\u00a0a goal of getting\u00a0some kind of legislation passed by the end of next year\u00a0and told Reuters it may be practical to pass a bill allowing people to join Medicare as early as age 50 or 55. The Health 202 wrote last week about the many varied\u00a0Medicare-for-All-style plans Democrats have proposed so far.\u00a0 The Food and Drug Administration campus in Silver Spring, Md. (Andrew Harnik\/AP) OOF: FDA inspectors found\u00a0a Mylan manufacturing plant\u00a0in West Virginia may have recorded that drugs passed tests even when they fell short of U.S. standards, during an inspection in November 2016,\u00a0Bloomberg News\u2019s Anna Edney wrote\u00a0in this\u00a0first in a series of four investigative pieces. \u201cThe inspectors also found bins full of shredded documents, including quality-control records, in parts of the factory where every piece of paper is supposed to be saved,\u201d Anna writes. \u201cA warning letter, the FDA\u2019s strongest rebuke, was drafted. It would mean the agency could refuse to consider any Mylan application for a new drug made at that plant until the company fixed things.\u201d But the FDA never sent Mylan a warning letter. By July 2017, agency\u00a0leaders had decided to leave the issue in Mylan\u2019s hands. \u201c[FDA Commissioner Scott] Gottlieb\u2019s actions on generic approvals have drawn praise from both parties in Congress,\u201d Anna reports. \u201cBut with Democrats having taken control of the House, members who oversee the FDA say they plan to examine a crucial public-health question posed by his efforts: Is the fast-tracking of those approvals coming at the expense of oversight that\u2019s supposed to ensure that drugs already on the market are safe and effective?\u201d A decline in inspections and a relaxing of penalties have raised quality concerns, Anna reports. While FDA\u00a0increased its generic drug approvals 94 percent in fiscal year 2018,\u00a0surveillance inspections done globally by the FDA\u2014meant to ensure existing drug-making plants meet U.S. standards\u2014 have fallen, she writes.\u00a0 Dr. Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood,\u00a0is photographed at the Baltimore City Health Department. (Marvin Joseph\/The Washington Post) OUCH: Planned Parenthood\u2019s new president Leana Wen is ready for a fight against the Trump administration, which is expected to soon announce a final Title X family-planning funding plan, our Post colleague Ariana Eunjung Cha reports.  The proposed plan announced in May would prohibit federal money from going to clinics that provide abortion services or referrals. The network of women\u2019s health and abortion\u00a0clinics serves about 41 percent of Title X patients, receiving about $60 million from the program, Ariana writes. In an interview with The Post, Wen said changes in the proposal \u201cwould compromise our ethical obligations,\" comparing abortion services to insulin for diabetics. \u201cI want people to think about what if this were any other aspect of medical care. Imagine if the Trump administration prevented people with diabetes from talking to their doctors about insulin,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cWhatever decisions are coming up have nothing to do with medicine and everything to do with politics.\u201d Wen pledged to try to get the expected new ruled\u00a0delayed, get lawmakers to reverse the changes\u00a0or take the issue to court. She\u00a0also noted the program serves mostly disadvantaged and minority women. \u201cThey are trying to prevent people who already have the greatest barrier\u201d from care, Wen said. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is joined at left by Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.),\u00a0the committee's ranking Democrat, at a hearing Tuesday on prescription drug prices. (J. Scott Applewhite\/AP) \u2014 Members of the\u00a0Senate Finance Committee debated\u00a0skyrocketing prescription drug prices in a\u00a0hearing\u00a0yesterday, vowing to summon pharmaceutical\u00a0executives before them in the future. Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley\u00a0(R-Iowa)\u00a0and ranking Democrat Ron Wyden\u00a0(Ore.)\u00a0noted in\u00a0opening statements they invited several pharmaceutical executives to testify before the panel, but\u00a0all but two declined. \"The companies that declined said they would be very happy to have discussions in private but not in public,\" Grassley said. \"That is not what I mean when I talk about transparency.\" \u201cThat ought to tell you something,\u201d Wyden said about the companies' refusal. \u201cEven the Big Tobacco companies were willing to come to Congress and testify, and they made a product that kills people. They all lied to me, but at least they showed up...The drugmakers are going to have to show up as well.\" \u2014 Discussion during the hearing largely revolved around ideas that have been floated before, such as\u00a0a potential change to the rebate structure, restructuring the 340B federal drug discount program (which requires drug companies to give discounts to hospitals serving\u00a0low-income people)\u00a0and allowing Medicare Part D to negotiate directly with drug companies -- one proposal that Grassley has said he doesn\u2019t want to pursue. Wyden said reforms are needed to Medicare Part D.\u00a0\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Medicare negotiating?\" Wyden asked. \"Private Part D plans negotiate with drugmakers \u2026 I don\u2019t see how Part D, as structured today, is going to protect the senior and the taxpayer.\u201d \u2014 When asked by Grassley to name one way to lower drug costs, former CBO Director Doug Holtz-Eakin\u00a0suggested changing the\u00a0340B drug program, which has grown far beyond its original scope. \u201cThe first thing to do is stop having policies that push up drug prices and one that comes to mind is the 340 B program,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a well-intentioned program that was intended to provide drugs at lower costs to needy patients. But it\u2019s not well-targeted on those patients right now, it\u2019s leading to higher drug costs, and I would encourage the committee to take a close look at reforming the 340B program.\u201d But Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) challenged Holtz-Eakin\u2019s remarks, saying she wanted to \u201cdisagree that 340B is the primary reason for higher prices. There\u2019s a whole lot of other reasons and that is not the primary reason.\u201d \u2014 There was also discussion around drug rebates, which the Department of Health and Human Services has\u00a0 targeted as a cause of high drug list prices. Peter Bach, director of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Center for Health Policy and Outcomes,\u00a0explained the current rebate structure allows higher list prices for drugs and higher rebates that \u201cpush more than the fair share to the patients that take expensive drugs,\u201d adding that those patients pay \u201cmore than the negotiated price.\u201d When Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) asked why an anti-kickback rule essentially barring rebates exists under the Social Security Act\u00a0but not for prescription drugs, there was laugher in the room when Holtz-Eakin said he \u201ccan\u2019t explain that and won\u2019t pretend to.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a transparent arrangement, and it does produce upward pressure on drug prices and the negotiation between the [pharmacy benefit managers]\u00a0and pharma in terms of the net cost,\" Cornyn said.\u00a0 Sen. Kamala Harris launches her campaign for preisdent at a rally in her hometown of Oakland, Calif. (REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage) \u2014 When Sen. Kamala Harris advocated at a CNN town hall this week for doing away with private health insurance to make way for Medicare-for-All, she\u00a0stepped into an area of specifics that made her vulnerable to criticism. Harris\u2019s suggestion that the United States should \u201cmove on\u201d from private health insurance, \u201cdrew attention to the fact that the Medicare-for-all plans backed by 16 senators \u2014 including five potential candidates for the Democratic nomination \u2014 would in effect remove private health insurance from the estimated 251 million Americans who use it, broadly disrupting the industry and the way Americans experience the medical system,\u201d our Post colleague Annie Linskey reports. There was a swift response from Republicans as well as from Howard Schultz, the billionaire coffee tycoon considering an independent presidential run. \u201cThat\u2019s not American,\u201d the former Starbucks chief executive, said on CBS News. \u201cWhat\u2019s next? What industry are we going to abolish next? The coffee industry?\u201d Annie compares the remarks in part to President Barack Obama, who was criticized for saying about the ACA before it was implemented: \u201cIf you like your health-care plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your health-care plan.\u201d \u201cOn the campaign trail, candidates often hear complaints from voters frustrated by rising drug prices, staggering and widely inconsistent medical bills, skyrocketing deductibles, unaffordable premiums, and difficult-to-conquer bureaucracies, creating pressure to offer a sweeping overhaul plan,\u201d Annie writes. \u201cBut the candidates\u2019 slogans inevitably prove difficult to implement. And often it\u2019s not exactly clear what those slogans meant to begin with.\u201d She adds experience suggests voters, \u201cdespite their complaints about the health system, often react negatively to proposals for sweeping change, possibly because of uncertainty about what would follow.\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. (Alex Wong\/Getty Images) \u2014 On the same day lawmakers were talking drug pricing on Capitol Hill, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called for pharmaceutical companies to bring down the cost of medications, criticizing the companies that \u201conce again announced large price increases\u201d at the beginning of the year.  Azar noted that a goal for the Trump administration is to bring down list prices altogether. \u201cDrug companies defend themselves by pointing out that these annual increases are on the \u2018list price\u2019 of drugs,\u201d he writes in a Stat op-ed. \u201cList prices are typically reduced by additional payments to middlemen such as pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers \u2026 But Americans know better, because increases in list prices hit their pocketbooks.\u201d Azar explicitly writes that \u201cthe definition of success for Americans and for President Trump will be lower list prices \u2014 not flat net prices or smaller and fewer list price increases.\u201d The inclusion suggests the administration is pushing back on pharmaceutical companies that have so far simply stalled price hikes, wrote Rachel Sachs, an associate professor of law at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis: Today The political pitfalls in the race to 2020","115":"For more than seven hours Wednesday, Michael Cohen unspooled a withering portrait of President Trump, painting his longtime patron as a liar and a fraud in starkly personal terms. He described how Trump ordered him to lie to the first lady about his relationship with an adult-film star and personally directed a hush-money scheme. He said Trump inflated his net worth to try to secure loans and to boost his status. He recounted how Trump made racist remarks, claiming he said at one point that African Americans were \u201ctoo stupid\u201d to vote for him. It was a stunning turn for a man who served as Trump\u2019s lawyer and all-purpose fixer for more than a decade, a role he once embraced with unapologetic ferocity \u2014 pledging to take a bullet on the mogul\u2019s behalf as evidence of his loyalty. On Wednesday, he was equally zealous about the president\u2019s failings. During occasionally emotional testimony before the House Oversight Committee, Cohen used his backstage view of Trump to level a broad attack against the president\u2019s character. \u201cSince taking office, he has become the worst version of himself,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cHe is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal.\u201d Cohen\u2019s depiction of himself as a credible witness was complicated by his own admitted criminal conduct and past lies \u2014 including false statements he made previously to Congress. Altogether, he has pleaded guilty to nine felonies, including tax evasion and campaign finance violations. In May, he is scheduled to begin serving a three-year prison sentence, the culmination of his dramatic fall from Trump intimate to outcast and felon. Throughout the day, Republicans members of the Oversight panel repeatedly used Cohen\u2019s lies to disparage him and challenge his veracity. \u201cCertainly it\u2019s the first time a convicted perjurer has been brought back to be a star witness in a hearing,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told Cohen, deriding him as a \u201ccheat\u201d and a \u201cfraudster\u201d who is about to go to prison. Referring to the Democrats, Jordan said, \u201cThey just want to use you, Mr. Cohen. You\u2019re their patsy today, Mr. Cohen.\u201d Cohen largely absorbed the assault without dissent, casting himself as a cautionary tale for other Trump allies. Asked during his testimony if White House staffers may end up in legal jeopardy because of their allegiance to the president, he replied, \u201cSadly, if they follow blindly like I have, the answer is yes.\u201d Cohen described a widespread culture of lying around Trump, as he sought to explain why he stayed by the president\u2019s side for so long. He described how their schemes evolved from \u201ctrivial\u201d to \u201csignificant and dangerous\u201d as Trump graduated from private businessman and television celebrity to the Republican presidential nominee. He portrayed himself as an unquestioning member of a cultlike following, saying he carried out the president\u2019s orders \u201cand concealed his illicit acts\u201d without hesi\u00adta\u00adtion because \u201cI was so mesmerized by Donald Trump that I was willing to do things for him that I knew were absolutely wrong.\u201d \u201cBeing around Mr. Trump was intoxicating,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWhen you were in his presence, you felt like you were involved in something greater than yourself \u2014 that you were somehow changing the world.\u201d Throughout the day, he offered an insider\u2019s unvarnished view of Trump, a perspective rarely seen by the public. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give you orders; he speaks in code,\u201d Cohen testified, seated alone at the witness table, his New York roots audible in his husky voice. \u201cAnd I understand the code because I\u2019ve been around him for a decade.\u201d He claimed Trump \u201cfrequently told me that his son Don Jr. had the worst judgment of anyone in the world.\u201d Branding the president a \u201cracist,\u201d Cohen recalled that Trump told him that \u201conly black people would live that way\u201d as they drove through a poor Chicago neighborhood. After slashing his own employees\u2019 salaries \u201cin half \u2014 including mine\u201d in 2008, Cohen said that Trump boasted about the $10\u00a0million tax refund he received from the Internal Revenue Service \u201cand said that he could not believe how stupid the government was for giving \u2018someone like him\u2019 that much money back.\u201d At another point, as reporters were asking about Trump obtaining a medical deferment to avoid military service in Vietnam, Cohen said Trump told him, \u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid? I wasn\u2019t going to Vietnam.\u2019\u00a0\u201d As for Trump\u2019s view of his chances as the 2016 presidential campaign unfolded, Cohen said, \u201cHe never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign \u2014 for him \u2014 was a marketing opportunity.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great,\u201d Cohen testified. \u201cMr. Trump would often say this campaign was going to be the \u2018greatest infomercial in political history.\u2019\u201d Cohen spent more than a decade championing his boss\u2019s brand and threatening potential foes that he would \u201ccome at you, grab you by the neck, and I\u2019m not going to let you go.\u201d Like Trump, who is from Queens, Cohen grew up on the edge of New York City, on Long Island, thirsting to conquer Manhattan, the epicenter of wealth, power and glamour. Before meeting Trump, Cohen became rich as a personal injury lawyer and various investments, including the taxi business. Cohen also invested in New York City real estate, paying millions for apartments in Trump properties, including Trump World Tower, where the developer, at the suggestion of Donald Trump Jr., drafted Cohen to beat back a 2006 revolt by the building\u2019s co-op board. The following year, Trump hired Cohen as his counsel. While trumpeting his boss\u2019s various projects, whether a proposed golf course in California or a possible 2012 presidential run, Cohen also found opportunities to promote his own ambitions. While helping to coordinate Trump\u2019s flirtation with a 2014 New York gubernatorial campaign, Cohen told Republican strategists he wanted to run for mayor. At one point, Cohen openly floated the idea of running on a statewide ticket as Trump\u2019s pick for lieutenant governor. The specter of Cohen talking up his own political aspirations while supposedly working on behalf of Trump rankled the billionaire\u2019s political advisers, some of whom said they began to question whether the attorney was as selfless as he proclaimed. Yet in his public statements, Cohen\u2019s fealty to his boss never wavered \u2014 that is, until July, several months after the FBI raided his residence and his office, when he declared that his \u201cfirst loyalty\u201d was to his family and country. \u201cOver the past year or so, I have done some real soul-searching,\u201d Cohen told the committee Wednesday in his opening remarks. \u201cFor those who question my motives for being here today, I understand. I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your \u2018fixer,\u2019 Mr. Trump.\u201d More than seven hours later, his eyes tired and face drawn, Cohen issued a last warning \u201cto those who support the president and his rhetoric as I once did.\u201d \u201cI pray the country doesn\u2019t make the same mistakes that I have made,\u201d he said, \u201cor pay the heavy price that my family and I are paying.\u201d","116":"THE PROGNOSIS President Trump sought to place the health care of Americans on center stage during his State of the Union address last night. But as on other issues, his record is decidedly mixed.  The president applauded the rollback of a key portion of the Affordable Care Act, which he has called a disaster. He called for protections for people with preexisting conditions, though his administration has worked against keeping them by trying to eliminate Obamacare. He pledged to bring down the price of prescription drugs and called for childhood cancer funding, earning some applause from Democrats. But Trump also called for halting the spread of HIV transmission before 2030 -- even though his previous budgets have proposed\u00a0slashing\u00a0money from government initiatives in that area. Democrats will deride his boasts about protecting preexisting conditions and\u00a0repealing the ACA's\u00a0penalty for lacking coverage. But Trump's\u00a0remarks about high drug prices are in a middle category:\u00a0It\u2019s an issue where there\u2019s room for bipartisan agreement but also partisan disputes over how far the government should go in regulating the pharmaceutical industry. It\u2019s been one year since Trump promised prescription drugs would become less expensive. Last night, he\u00a0tried to take a victory lap even though the policies his administration has proposed on the issue could take months or years to make a difference. \u201cAlready, as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut we must do more,\u201d the president added. \u201cIt is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.\u201d (Photo by Melina Mara\/The Washington Post) Over the past year, Trump has sought repeatedly\u00a0to take credit for bringing down pharmaceutical prices in the United States where they\u2019re higher than anywhere else. He\u2019s tweeted frequently about the issue \u2013 sometimes even trying to predict industry moves in advance \u2013 and last month hauled Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other top officials to the White House to express\u00a0frustration more progress wasn\u2019t being made. There\u2019s\u00a0truth to the drug price reductions Trump boasted about last night, although it's too early to claim his proposals have made the\u00a0difference. The consumer price index for prescription drugs fell by 0.6 percent in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As my colleague Glenn Kessler recently noted, that decline would be the first drop\u00a0in 46 years in the December-to-December timeframe (although there have been other 12-month periods with index declines). Trump\u2019s administration has certainly tried to look aggressive on the issue. The Food and Drug Administration says it has set a record for generic drug approvals. HHS has proposed requiring drugmakers to display prices in television ads, lowering some Medicare drug payments by pegging them to an international index and nixing secretive rebates exchanged between drug companies and pharmacy middlemen. These ideas \u2013 which haven\u2019t been finalized \u2013 could help move the needle. But they\u2019ll take time to put in place and the administration would need Congress to pass a bill in order to fully implement the international pricing index it has proposed for Medicare. Trump appeared to recognize that reality, asking Congress to pass such legislation. Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services: Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Ca.), who is running for her party's\u00a0presidential nomination: Here are the other health-care takeaways from Trump\u2019s address: 1. He asked Congress for funding to support the administration\u2019s new effort to end new HIV transmissions in a decade. \u201cTrump went beyond the promises of any of his predecessors since AIDS appeared as a deadly scourge nearly four decades ago,\u201d my colleague Amy Goldstein reports. \u201cHe announced a strategy to stop the spread of HIV by 2030 by concentrating as-yet unspecified resources on 48 counties and other \u2018hot spots\u2019 where half the nation\u2019s new infections occur. \u201cScientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTogether, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond.\u201d The new initiative will focus on 48 counties and seven states where new HIV infections are concentrated, Amy reports. \u201cTeams of HIV health workers \u2014 CDC employees or working through CDC grants \u2014 will fan out into such communities, trying to encourage residents at risk of HIV to get tested and to start preventive medicine or, if they test positive, to go on drug regimens to lessen their chances of getting sick or spreading the virus,\u201d she writes. Officials said the goal is to reduce new HIV infections by 75 percent within five years and 90 percent over the next decade. HHS Secretary Alex Azar: Catherine Rampell, an opinion columnist at The Post: Rep. Anthony Brown (D-Md.): 2. Trump also asked Congress for more money to combat childhood cancer. Trump told the story of 10-year-old Grace Eline, who was diagnosed with brain cancer last year and was a guest of First Lady Melania Trump. He said the budget request he\u2019ll present to Congress will request additional funding for childhood cancer research. \u201cMany childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMy budget will ask Congress for $500 million dollars over the next 10 years to fund this critical lifesaving research.\u201d 3. Trump said lawmakers should pass legislation prohibiting abortion midway through pregnancy. He denounced two controversial measures in New York and Virginia making it easier to obtain a late-term abortion. The Virginia measure, which has been tabled, would have allowed a single doctor to sign off on a third-trimester abortion instead of the three currently required and would have removed language requiring the danger to the mother be \u201csubstantial and irremediable.\u201d The new law in New York\u00a0allows women\u00a0to now get late-term abortions if their health \u2014 not only their life \u2014 is threatened. \u201cThere could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth.\u201d Trump slammed Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D), whose description of how the law might apply to a live birth prompted accusations from Republicans that he was implying infanticide. \u201cThese are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.\u201d The president asked lawmakers to pass a measure prohibiting abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy based on the idea that a fetus can feel pain beyond that point of development. The House has passed such legislation in the past, but it\u2019s always been blocked by Democrats in the Senate. \u201cLet us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0\u201cAnd let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: \u00a0all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of\u00a0God.\u201d Trump added that he\u2019ll again propose paid family leave in his budget, an idea he spent considerable time on in last year\u2019s State of the Union address. \u201cI am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave -- so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child,\u201d he said. New York Times reporter Emily Cochrane: Anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser: Anti-abortion rights group March for Life: Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen, a guest of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.): 4. Trump patted Congress on the back for ditching Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate penalty and for passing the \"Right to Try\" act and an opioids package. \u201cWe eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty -- and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed Right to Try,\u201d he said. \"Right to Try\" is a new law the president signed last year, which allows terminally ill patients access to drugs not fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration if they've exhausted all other treatment options. It's the only bill Trump mentioned in last year's State of the Union. Politico's Sarah Karlin-Smith: House Energy and Commerce ranking member Greg Walden (D-Ore.): 5. Trump gave a rah-rah for preexisting condition protections. \u201cThe next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs -- and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions,\u201d Trump said. But here\u2019s what Trump didn\u2019t mention: His administration is refusing to defend in court a challenge against the ACA which could dismantle its protections for patients with preexisting medical conditions. Jonathan Cohn, senior national correspondent for HuffPost: Rep. Ben Ray Lujan\u00a0(D-N.M.): Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.): President Trump, in front of Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) delivers his State of the Union address. (Toni L. Sandys\/The Washington Post) AHH: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she was disappointed the president did not discuss \u201cthe gun violence epidemic\u201d in his speech, even as he listed threats against the country. \u201cThe overwhelming reaction that I\u2019m receiving is that the president talked about security in so many different ways, and he totally ignored the gun violence epidemic in our country,\u201d she told reporters after the address, Roll Call\u2019s Katherine Tully-McManus reports. Pelosi\u2019s guests to the address included Mattie Scott, a California chapter president at the Brady Campaign \u00a0and Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed in last year\u2019s Parkland, Fla. shooting. \u201cThey were just so saddened by the fact that he made no pass at it, no acknowledgment of it, while representing that he was talking about keeping American people safe,\u201d Pelosi said. The president did make a reference to the October shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, though the mention was mostly in the context of anti-Semitism and to honor a first responder. OOF: A top policy aid to Pelosi reportedly met with top health-industry executives to express that Democratic Party leadership had reservations about the kind of universal health care plan some new members of the party are\u00a0pushing. The Pelosi aide, Wendell Primus, met with Blue Cross Blue Shield executives and outlined five concerns party leadership had with \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d the Intercept\u2019s Ryan Grim reports, citing sources familiar with the meeting. Their objections centered around\u00a0cost, stakeholder opposition and implementation issues.\u00a0Primus assured the executives in the early December meeting\u00a0that they would help the insurance industry bat down efforts for a single-payer health care plan, and insisted the party was more focused on tackling high drug prices, Ryan reports. Pelosi appears to remain\u00a0skeptical\u00a0as congressional Democrats have introduced a range of Medicare-for-all plans, without unifying support behind any one proposal or a deep\u00a0understanding of what all the proposals would encompass, as Health 202 wrote last month.\u00a0 For his part, Primus told Ryan he did not discuss a specific deal with insurers during the December meeting. And Pelosi spokesperson Henry Connelly\u00a0described the presentation as a \u201ca broad look at the health care environment and some of House Democrats\u2019 legislative priorities over the next two years in a period of GOP control of the Senate and White House.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not going to barter lower prescription drug costs for inaction in the rest of the health care industry,\u201d Connelly said. Supporters of a voter-approved measure to fully expand Medicaid in Utah rally at the state Capitol in Salt Lake Cityto urge\u00a0lawmakers not to change the law. (Rick Bowmer\/AP) OUCH: Just as a bill in Utah to limit voter-approved Medicaid expansion is moving quickly through the state legislature, lawmakers in Idaho are also working on a measure pushing back on expansion of the program. Three months after 61 percent of the state\u2019s voters approved Medicaid expansion, a group of 15 conservative state lawmakers in Idaho are working on a bill to add work requirements and monthly premiums for individuals eligible for the expanded program, Kaiser Health News\u2019s Phil Galewitz reports. Republicans in Idaho said the legislation is an effort to control spending. \u201cWe need to put some sideboards on the expansion,\u201d Idaho House majority caucus leader John Vander Woude said, adding voters didn\u2019t understand the cost associated with expansion when they voted for it at the ballot. He said the referendum voters approved \u201chad no financing to show what it would cost\u2026 the best way to implement this is do it in a cost-effective way to get the results we are looking for.\u201d Phil writes Jamila Michener, an assistant professor of government at Cornell University warned the actions coming out of Idaho and Utah \u201ccould chill other potential Medicaid expansion ballot referendums planned for 2020 in Florida and other states.\u201d Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) (Kristoffer Tripplaar\/For The Washington Post) \u2014 Republican leaders on the House Energy and Commerce Committee are asking their Democratic counterparts to hold a hearing on Medicare-for-all, anxious to highlight how expensive such a plan could be. Ranking member\u00a0Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and health subcommittee leader Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Tex.) wrote that Democrats should explain how they'd pay for dramatically expanding government-sponsored health coverage and whether that would upend the current system of private insurance. \u201cThe American people should hear how House Democrats expect to address the massive costs associated with Medicare-for-All,\u201d the pair wrote to Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.). \u201cWe have a responsibility to review any legislative proposal that is supported by so many members of the House majority, especially one that threatens to impact directly the lives of millions of Americans by upending how they receive their coverage.\u201d \u2014 Two of the seven\u00a0drug company\u00a0summoned by\u00a0Senate Finance\u00a0Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking member\u00a0Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to testify before Congress have agreed to send representatives to appear\u00a0before the panel, the committee said yesterday. Merck\u2019s chief executive Ken Frazier said he\u2019ll be one of the pharmaceutical leaders who will testify at a hearing set for Feb. 26, Reuters reports.

Cynthia Thielen told Lindsey, \u201cbut you have to take that first, strong step \u2014 and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Hawaii was the first state to ban smoking for people younger than 21. \u201cThe bill aims to raise the legal minimum age to purchase or possess cigarettes to 30 by next year; 40 by 2021; 50 by 2022; 60 by 2023 and 100 by 2024,\u201d Lindsey reports. \u201cThe timetable would allow the state to plan for a loss in cigarette-tax revenue, according to reports. The bill does not apply to cigars, chewing tobacco or e-cigarettes.\u201d \u201cBasically, we essentially have a group who are heavily addicted \u2014 in my view, enslaved by a ridiculously bad industry \u2014 which has enslaved them by designing a cigarette that is highly addictive, knowing that it highly lethal.

When senators return Monday night for a vote on a judicial nominee, it will be just their 50th roll call of the year, and with only a couple of other votes likely for the week, the Senate will hit the three-month mark of 2019 about 50 percent behind the pace that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) set in early 2017 after President Trump took office. The slow start is indicative of a broader problem for Trump, McConnell and Republicans, as they head into the 2020 election season with a policy agenda that is fairly timid and has so far been mostly invisible in the GOP-controlled Senate. The first few weeks of January and February dealt mostly with the leftover mess from last year, reopening portions of the federal government amid Trump\u2019s standoff with Democrats over border wall funding. In mid-February, the Senate approved a massive spending bill for agencies and bipartisan federal lands legislation, both holdovers from 2018. Ever since, the Senate has considered just three pieces of legislation consequential enough to merit a roll-call vote, and two of those came over Trump and McConnell\u2019s objections. Democrats and a small group of Republicans used parliamentary tactics to pass resolutions opposing the president\u2019s declaration of emergency powers in building the wall and another to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. Trump has vetoed the first resolution and is expected to veto the Yemen resolution if the House signs off on it. In the past five weeks, the only leadership-backed legislation to receive a vote came on a bill designed to divide Democrats after controversial comments from Virginia Democrats about an abortion bill in the commonwealth\u2019s legislature. It failed on a procedural vote. With Democrats taking over the House, McConnell lowered expectations for this year\u2019s legislative output and reset his key priority of confirming Trump\u2019s nominees to the federal courts. \u201cYou know what my top priority is, I\u2019ve made it very clear. It\u2019s the judiciary,\u201d McConnell told reporters the day after the midterm elections. He recited the record-setting pace of confirming appellate court judges and two Supreme Court justices. \u201cWe intend to keep confirming as many as we possibly can for as long as we\u2019re in a position to do it,\u201d he said. Other than that, McConnell predicted that they would work on \u201csomething on infrastructure\u201d and would consider Trump\u2019s push for lower costs for prescription drugs. So far, division runs deep on the focus of an infrastructure bill \u2014 mass transit or rural highways \u2014 and more so on how to fund it. The Senate Finance Committee has held hearings about prescription drugs, but the chairman, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) described his efforts as still in the \u201cfact-finding\u201d phase. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, is working on legislation that would update higher-education laws, as well as a bill to stabilize health-care costs. Those are, at least, months away from getting committee approval, let alone coming to the full Senate. It\u2019s unclear whether the Senate or House will consider full budget resolutions, as they must first reach agreement on the broader spending framework. A 2011 budget law would slash spending by nearly $100 billion next year, and a deal to avert that is not likely until the late summer or fall. McConnell\u2019s focus on judges will soon run into a problem of his own success: a lack of prominent positions to fill. The appeals court circuits, one step below the Supreme Court, are at the equivalent of full employment \u2014 there are just nine vacancies, out of more than 180 posts, and just three do not yet have a nominee in the pipeline. Within weeks, Republicans will run out of appellate judges to confirm. Hundreds of district court nominees and other less prominent sub-Cabinet executive branch posts await confirmation. McConnell, the self-described institutionalist, is poised to change the rules to a simple-majority vote, rather than the traditional two-thirds majority, that will speed up Senate procedures for approving those lower-level nominees. Democrats will charge hypocrisy, after McConnell blasted them for \u201cbreaking the rules\u201d in 2013 when they used the same maneuver. But the result is likely to just turn the Senate into an assembly line for confirming nominees that no one has ever heard of, not the type of moves that drive the political base the way Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation clash last fall boosted turnout in conservative states. Some GOP strategists are warning that Republicans need a broader agenda on domestic policy issues or else they will remain in the House minority and put their Senate majority in peril next year. \u201cThe ability of House and Senate Republicans to offer a positive agenda that addresses people\u2019s kitchen table priorities, from jobs, wages and now retirement fears to health care concerns, could well be the deciding factor in who controls the next Congress,\u201d David Winston, a Republican pollster who advises congressional GOP leaders, recently wrote. The Senate\u2019s lethargic kickoff only has one comparison this century, in 2011, when the reverse situation took place. Democrats lost the House in 2010 but held on to the Senate while Barack Obama was in the White House. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), then the Senate majority leader, slowed the Senate to a crawl. It only cast 46 votes in the first quarter of the year, well under the brisk pace Reid set to start the previous new Congresses in 2007 and 2009. Eventually Reid focused on so-called messaging bills, those that were designed to fail but also put GOP senators on the record on issues that might hurt their reelection prospects. Now, McConnell seems headed in the same direction. He will soon force a vote on the Green New Deal, the emerging proposal from liberal Democrats to combat climate change that has divided their party. McConnell is hoping this go-slow approach follows Reid\u2019s success, as Democrats gained Senate seats in the 2012 elections as Obama won reelection.

Valdis Dombrovskis, a European Commission vice president, said Wednesday that plans by the Greek government to provide protection for distressed mortgage holders are incomplete, despite weeks of negotiations between the government and leading banks aimed at coming up with a compromise. Following a decade of financial crisis and international bailouts, nearly half of Greece\u2019s property and business loans are non-performing or in arrears by more than three months, and the government is under pressure to help banks improve their balance sheets. Current mortgage protection rules, which shield distressed property owners from foreclosure, formally expire Thursday. \u201cWe fully share the objective of the Greek authorities to protect more vulnerable households,\u201d Dombrovskis said. \u201cHowever, currently, the legislative proposal has a large number of design and technical details which need to be settled so as to ensure that that scheme is generally temporary, properly targeted, can be operational in the near future, and improves the payment culture in Greece by not protecting strategic defaulters.\u201d Eurozone finance ministers will on March 11 decide whether Athens has met the criteria for the next round of debt relief. The measures under consideration include a freeze on low interest rates for bailout debt repayments as well as the payout of profits from Greek government bonds held by the European Central Bank. Dombrovskis made the comments after the European Commission issued a 49-page report on the progress of Greek reforms. It also expressed concerns over delayed administrative reforms, and an increase in hiring in the public sector, as well as a recent minimum wage increase that it said \u201cposes risks for employment growth and competitiveness.\u201d EU Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is due in Athens Thursday to discuss the results of the report. ___","119":"If you took a secret poll in the U.S. Senate as to whether the shutdown was a mistake, you\u2019d likely get 100 yes votes. Now at least two senators, senior ones at that, are suggesting we never make that mistake again.

And the level of real GDP in the first quarter of 2019 is expected to be reduced by 0.2 percent.1 (The effect on the annualized quarterly growth rate in those quarters will be larger.)\u201d Fed up with self-inflicted political and economic wounds, Sens.

Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Finance Committee, put out his own statement last Friday. \u201cJust common sense tells me we need to reopen government,\u201d said Grassley. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll tell you that I\u2019m embarrassed to even talk about it.

Europe\u2019s soccer body can ban clubs from its Champions League in the most serious cases of breaking \u201cFinancial Fair Play\u201d rules designed to control excessive spending on player transfers and wages. UEFA said Thursday its independent club finance panel is focusing on \u201cseveral alleged violations of FFP that were recently made public in various media outlets.\u201d Internal documents about Man City\u2019s business and emails between club executives have been published in the Football Leaks series led by Der Spiegel magazine. The revelations suggest Man City officials deceived UEFA over several years, including by disguising the source of revenue from overvalued sponsorships tied to the club\u2019s owners in Abu Dhabi. UEFA acted after the latest release last Friday included complete emails detailing how Abu Dhabi\u2019s owners secretly paid into inflated commercial deals. \u201cThe accusation of financial irregularities are entirely false,\u201d Man City said in a statement , adding it \u201cwelcomes the opening\u201d of the formal probe. \u201c(It\u2019s) an opportunity to bring to an end the speculation resulting from the illegal hacking and out of context publication of City emails,\u201d the English champion said. The club has not disputed authenticity of the documents since publication began in November. In one batch of communications between Man City officials, the club seemed ready to threaten to destroy UEFA with legal action before reaching a 2014 settlement agreement to close an investigation. Then, it forfeited 20 million euros ($22.8 million) to UEFA in Champions League prize money but continued to play in world soccer\u2019s most prestigious club competition. The Pep Guardiola-coached team is currently top of England\u2019s Premier League, seeking its fourth league title in the past eight seasons. The team hosts Schalke next week in the Champions League, holding a 3-2 lead from the first leg. UEFA has since 2011 monitored the accounts of all clubs which qualify to play in the Champions League and Europa League. It was launched as the flagship policy of UEFA\u2019s then-president Michel Platini, who criticized \u201cfinancial doping\u201d by some club owners after the global financial downturn a decade ago. Rules were drafted forcing clubs toward breaking even on their soccer-related income and spending to prevent clubs from becoming unsustainable. It also sought to control wealthy owners distorting the market in transfers and wages by driving up costs. The system includes assessing the fair market value of sponsor deals to prevent clubs evading limits on cash injections by owners. Critics of FFP say it protects historically successful clubs with global brands from challenges by ambitious newcomers. The biggest forfeits were paid in 2014 by Man City and Paris Saint-Germain, which were bought using sovereign wealth respectively by Abu Dhabi\u2019s ruling family in 2008 and Qatar\u2019s in 2011. UEFA gave no timetable for the case, stating it \u201cwill make no further comments on the matter while the investigation is ongoing.\u201d ___","121":"The FBI participated in a May surveillance operation of a GOP political operative at the center of an election fraud investigation in North Carolina, newly released court documents show, raising fresh questions about how long it has taken federal prosecutors to pursue the matter. Federal and state investigators observed Leslie McCrae Dowless meeting with people he hired to collect ballots ahead of last year\u2019s primary election in North Carolina\u2019s 9th\u00a0Congressional District, according to state search warrants released Wednesday. At the time, Dowless was working on behalf of Republican candidate Mark Harris, who went on to beat GOP incumbent Robert Pittenger by 828 votes. Dowless also worked for the Harris campaign in the fall, when Harris narrowly edged out Democrat Dan McCready in the unofficial results. State officials ordered a new election in the 9th District last month after concluding that Dowless orchestrated a \u201ccoordinated, unlawful, and substantially resourced\u201d scheme to collect, fill out, forge and in some cases discard absentee ballots on behalf of Harris. Separately, the Wake County district attorney\u2019s office in Raleigh last month charged Dowless and four others on felony counts, including possession of absentee ballots and obstruction of justice. Harris has denied knowledge of the scheme. He said last month he would not run in the special election scheduled for later this year. State elections officials have said they repeatedly warned federal prosecutors about the ballot irregularities in the 9th District during the past two years, but got little response. The first public sign of an active Justice Department investigation came this month, when a federal grand jury issued subpoenas in the case. Wake County search warrants released Wednesday in response to a request by a coalition of news organizations, including The Washington Post, show that the FBI was investigating Dowless last spring \u2014 before both the primary and general elections. In an interview, Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman said the FBI suspended its involvement in the probe because of Justice Department guidelines that caution against taking investigative steps close to an election. The joint FBI and state surveillance took place on May 3, 2018, documents show. The 9th\u00a0District primary was May 8 and the general election was Nov. 6. Freeman said she was not aware of the FBI resuming its activity until after the State Board of Elections called for a new election last month. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. FBI Special Agent James Kaylor, who documents show participated in the surveillance operation, did not respond to a request for comment. In the surveillance operation described in the search warrants, state and FBI investigators jointly watched Dowless meet with individuals and conduct transactions at a CashPoints automated teller machine at a convenience store in Bladen County, N.C. \u2014 the epicenter of the alleged fraud in the 9th\u00a0District, which stretches east from Charlotte along the South Carolina border. The individuals later told investigators Dowless had offered them money to collect ballots, according to the documents. State investigators cited that evidence when they asked a judge in December and January to authorize several search warrants, including one that sought Dowless\u2019s bank records to determine who he was paying and from what source of funding. Documents show that investigators are also seeking text messages and location data from Dowless\u2019s cellphone and bank records for Patriots for Progress, a political committee affiliated with Dowless that Harris paid when he hired the operative. State election officials said during a hearing last month that payment may have violated campaign finance law. It remains unknown if the office of U.S. Attorney Robert J. Higdon Jr. of the Eastern District of North Carolina is involved in the case. The federal subpoenas disclosed this week were sought by the Justice Department\u2019s Public Integrity Section in Washington. Complicating matters is the fact that one of Harris\u2019s sons, John, has been an assistant U.S. attorney in Higdon\u2019s office since the fall \u2014 though he did not work there at the time of the surveillance in May. Last month, John Harris testified at a state elections board hearing that he had warned his father that he believed Dowless employed illegal tactics to collect absentee ballots. Three individuals with knowledge of the investigation said John Harris could be called as a witness in the federal case. Also Wednesday, the State Board of Elections published its official order for a new election in the 9th District \u2014 including a description of all the evidence the board considered in concluding that fraud had tainted the result last year. Among the findings was expert analysis from two college professors who found that the proportion of absentee ballots requested but not returned was anomalously high in Bladen and Robeson, the two counties where Dowless worked. The analysis suggests that in addition to allegedly orchestrating the collection, filling out and forging of ballots in the 9th\u00a0District, Dowless may also have been responsible for discarding ballots. The board also found, contrary to claims by Republicans, that the number of absentee ballots affected by Dowless\u2019s operation exceeded the 905-vote margin between Harris and McCready. And the board rebuked the Harris campaign for failing to comply with a subpoena for all communications related to Dowless and absentee ballots \u2014 and promised further action. \u201cThis board cannot allow parties or their counsel to behave in this manner,\u201d the order states. An attorney for Harris declined to comment. An attorney for the Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The board could pursue an additional hearing on the lawyers\u2019 conduct or a complaint with the state bar. \u201cI think the board is signaling that it took this investigation seriously,\u201d said the board\u2019s general counsel, Josh Lawson. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to emphasize the absolute necessity for strong laws but also a system to enforce those laws. This is what an investigation into fraud should look like.\u201d","122":"With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0The white supremacist who live-streamed his Friday rampage at a New Zealand mosque posted a manifesto online that said the attack was partly inspired by Dylann Roof\u2019s 2015 massacre of nine black churchgoers in South Carolina, police said. Globalization has had positive impacts, but it\u2019s also empowered evildoers. Friday\u2019s terrorism underscores how much the contagion of white nationalism has spread internationally. Christchurch, New Zealand, is 8,545 miles from Charleston, S.C., but social media helps make the world more interconnected than ever. In this case, 21st-century technologies fostered kinship between people across borders and oceans over their shared hatred of Muslims and immigrants. At least 49 people are dead and an additional 48 patients are being treated at hospitals after two\u00a0mosques were hit during Friday prayers. Authorities say 41 were killed at the Al Noor Mosque across the street from a downtown park, and seven more were fatally shot at a suburban mosque in Linwood. The police announced that three people are in custody who they believe were involved in the violence. Police deactivated an improvised explosive device that was attached to one of the vehicles used by the suspects. Investigators have confirmed that the same man who streamed 17 minutes of footage of himself opening fire at the downtown mosque from a helmet camera also published a 74-page manifesto that mentioned Roof. \u201cIn the manifesto, the purported shooter identified himself as a 28-year-old white man born in Australia,\u201d Isaac Stanley-Becker.

Bass responded Thursday \u2026 that it was \u2018Afghan corruption and misuse of equipment, funds and other support provided by the American people\u2019 that dishonored the troops. \u2026 In a sharply worded statement, the State Department said Mohib had been \u2018summoned\u2019 to a meeting with U.S. Under Secretary for Political Affairs David Hale, who reminded him that \u2018attacks on Ambassador Khalilzad are attacks on the Department and only serve to hinder the bilateral relationship and the peace process. \u2026 The Afghan government has been excluded from talks between Khalilzad and Taliban representatives, who concluded a lengthy fifth round of negotiations Tuesday in Qatar.\u201d 5. Britain is as adrift as ever. Brexit is now delayed after the British Parliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s latest plan for leaving the E.U. \u201cNow Britain almost certainly will not leave the European Union in two weeks \u2014 unless E.U. leaders reject its request for an extension and it crashes out with no deal,\u201d William Booth, Karla Adam and Michael Birnbaum report. \u201cThe vote to delay Brexit passed 412 to 202. Also on Thursday, lawmakers voted against holding a second Brexit referendum, a complete do-over that could reverse the result of the historic June 2016 plebiscite. May is offering lawmakers a stark choice: support her now twice-rejected Brexit deal in a third \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 next week \u2026 or face the prospect of a Brexit delay that could stretch far into the future, perhaps a year or more. \u2026 European leaders will have to decide what to do with Britain when they gather for two days in Brussels starting next Thursday. They are divided over how much rope to give.\u201d \u201cBrexit will mark the end of Britain\u2019s role as a great power,\u201d Fareed Zakaria writes in his column for today\u2019s paper. 6. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is increasingly relying on motorcycle-riding paramilitary gangs to sow terror among anti-government protesters as he clings to power. He\u2019s publicly urging the\u00a0\u201ccolectivos\u201d to intensify their efforts, as the country teeters on the edge of economic collapse and a U.S.-backed opposition movement presses for his ouster. These government-backed thugs are nimble and committed \u2014 and have an extraordinary ability to sow terror. Mary Beth Sheridan and Mariana Zu\u00f1iga sketch this terrifying scene from Caracas: \u201cThe neighbors were fed up. For days, they\u2019d had no electricity or running water because of a massive national blackout. So \u2026 they piled logs and garbage into a makeshift barricade in their middle-class Caracas neighborhood and started yelling slogans against the government. Then came the motorcycles. There were at least 20 of them, their motors buzzing, driven by men with scarves over their faces \u2026 The demonstrators scattered. But as people in surrounding buildings started hurling bottles at the bikers, the men raised their weapons \u2014 pistols and rifles \u2014 and opened fire. No one was injured. But the neighbors were terrified. \u2018Now we can\u2019t even protest, because they\u2019ll shoot at us,\u2019 said Delia Arellano, 72.\u201d President Trump meets with Kim Jong Un in Hanoi last month. (Evan Vucci\/AP) 7. Foreign leaders are taking advantage of President Trump's proclivity for personal diplomacy to go around diplomatic and national security experts. \u201cKim Jong Un, Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin are among the heads of state who have cut out the middle layers of aides and agency officials to talk to Mr. Trump,\u201d the Wall Street Journal's Vivian Salama and Peter Nicholas report. \u201cMr. Trump has encouraged such approaches, but they have added a layer of ambiguity to foreign affairs. ...\u00a0 \u201cSome advisers worry that Mr. Trump, a foreign-policy novice when he became president, could overpromise where the U.S. isn\u2019t prepared to deliver, or fail to properly hold leaders accountable on issues with national security implications. ...\u00a0An official familiar with the inner workings of the White House said the president\u2019s advisers suspect that he regularly speaks with world leaders on his phone.\u00a0'We never know who he\u2019s talking to or what he\u2019s agreed to,' the official said. ...\u00a0Foreign officials have questioned whether conversations they have held with the president\u2019s cabinet were 'representative of reality,' a former U.S. official who served under the Trump administration said.\u201d\u00a0 8. Bigger picture: Autocracy is on the march and the strongmen are striking back. Brookings fellow Robert Kagan argues in a sobering new essay, which will run in the print edition of Sunday\u2019s newspaper, that the rise of authoritarianism poses an existential threat to the liberal democratic world. He calls it a profound ideological, as well as strategic, challenge that we have no idea how to confront. \u201cIt has returned armed with new and hitherto unimaginable tools of social control and disruption that are shoring up authoritarian rule at home, spreading it abroad and reaching into the very heart of liberal societies to undermine them from within,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe authoritarians now have regained their confidence and found their voice in a way they have not since 1942 and, just as was true in the decades before World War II, the most powerful anti-liberal regimes \u2018are no longer content simply to contain democracy,\u2019 as the editors of the Journal of Democracy observed in 2016. The regimes now want to \u2018roll it back by reversing advances dating from the time of the democratic surge.\u2019\u201d WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- French aviation experts began work Friday on the heavily damaged data and voice recorders from Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, while new revelations have suggested additional links with an earlier crash in Indonesia involving the same type of aircraft. Paul Schemm reports: \u201cThe two so-called \u2018black boxes\u2019 arrived at France\u2019s Bureau d\u2019Enqu\u00eates et d\u2019Analyses, which has extensive experience analyzing crashes, on Thursday. Germany had earlier turned down the opportunity to examine the recorders. The data extracted from the recorders will be used to reconstruct the six minute flight before the Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed into a farm field about 40 miles from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 passengers and crew, including the voice communication of the pilots and the readings of the various sensors. -- Ethiopian Airlines organized a memorial service Thursday at the crash site, where mourners filled the air with cries as bulldozers swept through debris. Paul was there: \u201cMost of the Ethio\u00adpian plane\u2019s pieces have been pushed into piles, but signs of the tragedy are still everywhere: a torn business card from Kenya, a headrest cover from the flight\u2019s Cloud 9 business class, a brochure for Parvati.org, whose director of strategic initiatives, Darcy Belanger, was on the flight to attend the environmental conference in Nairobi. \u2026 The plane plowed nose down into the earth, and much of the wreckage was buried at least 60 feet deep, said Zhang Jun, a construction engineer working at the site. \u2026 The issue of human remains was on the minds of many of the mourners as they plaintively asked how they could bury their dead.\u201d -- Domestic airfares in India have spiked sharply since the country grounded its Boeing 737 Max aircraft fleet. \u201cAn analysis by travel website Yatra.com showed an average fare hike of 65 percent on key routes compared to a year ago,\u201d Niha Masih reports from New Delhi.

(Moriah Balingit, Nick Anderson, Susan Svrluga and Devlin Barrett) Federal prosecutors brought terrorism and other serious charges against five people arrested last year on a New Mexico compound, alleging in a new indictment that the group was gathering weapons and training in their squalid quarters to kill FBI and military personnel. The case drew significant attention when the group was first arrested last year \u2014 in part because officials suggested they were Muslim \u201cextremists.\u201d (Matt Zapotosky) The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that the families of Sandy Hook victims can sue the gunmaker Remington over the 2012 mass shooting. Adam Lanza used the company\u2019s Bushmaster AR-15 rifle in the attack, and the families have argued that Remington negligently allowed civilians to use the weapon even though it was mainly intended for military and law enforcement purposes. (Fred Barbash) The Southern Poverty Law Center fired co-founder Morris Dees for unspecified reasons.

(Laurence I. Barrett) REPUBLICANS DIVIDED: -- Twelve GOP senators joined all their Democratic colleagues to pass a resolution disapproving Trump\u2019s \u201cemergency\u201d declaration, but the measure fell short of a veto-proof majority. Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and John Wagner report: \u201cThe disapproval resolution passed the House last month, so the 59-to-41 Senate vote will send the measure to the president\u2019s desk. Trump intends to use the first veto of his presidency to strike it down ...\u00a0In the end, only one Republican who is up for reelection next year \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine \u2014 voted for the disapproval resolution. In addition to Collins and [Rob Portman (Ohio)], the other GOP senators voting for the resolution were Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Roy Blunt (Mo.), Mike Lee (Utah), Jerry Moran (Kan.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rand Paul (Ky.), Mitt Romney (Utah), Marco Rubio (Fla.), Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) and Roger Wicker (Miss.).\u201d -- Some Republicans said Trump\u2019s strategy of framing the vote in personal terms, rather than providing a legal rationale for the declaration, may have prevented the White House from limiting the number of GOP defections. Seung Min Kim and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cTrump\u2019s personal pleas and pressure were among a series of missed opportunities and missteps by the White House that contributed to a defeat notably worse than the administration had hoped for, according to officials and lawmakers familiar with the efforts. \u2026 The administration, for example, failed to give opposing GOP senators legal opinions, project details and other information that they had requested about the national emergency, according to lawmakers and Capitol Hill aides. Vice President Pence was also unable or unwilling to make commitments on behalf of the president even while serving as Trump\u2019s main emissary to negotiate with Republicans, people familiar with the debate said.\u201d -- Spooked by the threat of a Trump-backed primary challenge, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) flip-flopped and decided to vote against the resolution after writing an op-ed explaining why he strongly supported it. Paul Kane writes. \u201cTillis\u2019s actions highlighted a hardening reality in Washington: Republicans who have real near-term political skin in the game are not willing to stand up to him. ...\u00a0Of the 22 Senate Republicans on the ballot in November 2020, Trump went 20 for 22 on the Yemen resolution and 21 for 22 on the border wall. Chief among those is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who pulled a slightly lower-profile version of Tillis\u2019s reversal. McConnell initially opposed the emergency declaration and privately warned Trump in a White House meeting that he would face a significant bloc of GOP defections. Like most Republicans facing a reelection in 2020, McConnell\u2019s most vulnerable election would come in a GOP primary, particularly if Trump does not vociferously support the 34-year veteran of the Senate. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to win reelection if you don\u2019t first win the GOP primary, so even Republicans who could face difficult general elections lined up behind Trump rather than risk his wrath. Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) voted to support Trump this week. ... Gardner simply kept his head down for weeks, avoiding a public position until Thursday.\u201d -- The Denver Post, which provided pivotal support for Gardner during the 2014 Senate race, said its endorsement was a mistake. From a blistering editorial in today\u2019s paper: \u201cWe believed he\u2019d be a statesman. \u2026 We see now that was a mistake \u2014 consider this our resolution of disapproval. Gardner has been too busy walking a political tight rope to be a leader. He has become precisely what we said in our endorsement he would not be: \u2018a political time-server interested only in professional security.\u2019 \u2026 We no longer know what principles guide the senator and regret giving him our support in a close race against Mark Udall.\u201d -- Meanwhile, Rep. Bob Bishop (R-Utah) joined the group of Republicans leveling hyperbolic attacks against the Green New Deal. He said the ideas within it are \u201ctantamount to genocide.\u201d It escalated from there.\u00a0Antonia Noori Farzan reports:\u00a0\u201cBishop argued that the plan had been formulated by people who \u2018judge distance not in miles but in subway stops,\u2019 an apparent reference to the resolution\u2019s House sponsor, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). \u2018The genesis of this concept is really coming from Easterners who live in an urban setting and have no view of what it\u2019s like in the rest of America,\u2019 he said. After the news conference was over, Axios reporter Amy Harder pointed out that the term \u2018genocide\u2019 refers to the deliberate mass murder of a particular national or ethnic group, and asked Bishop how the Green New Deal fit that definition. \u2018I\u2019m an ethnic,\u2019 Bishop said. \u2018I\u2019m a Westerner.\u2019 \u2018And you think the Green New Deal is going to kill you?\u2019 Harder asked. \u2018If you actually implement everything they want to,\u2019 Bishop replied. \u2018Killing would be positive.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 THERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- The House voted 420-0 to pass a resolution urging the Justice Department to publicly release all of special counsel Bob Mueller\u2019s report, but Trump allies blocked\u00a0it from getting an up-or-down\u00a0vote in the Senate. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cThe resolution by itself cannot force Attorney General William P. Barr to publish more of the report than he intends to \u2014 and that is why even some of the Republicans supporting it complained that the measure was a waste of time. \u2026 The resolution is not expected to get a vote in the GOP-led Senate, where Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) tried to arrange one Thursday, but he was foiled by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).\u201d -- A New York appellate court ruled that a defamation lawsuit against Trump by former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant Summer Zervos should be allowed to proceed.\u00a0She's one of more than a dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Felicia Sonmez and David A. Fahrenthold report: \u201cThe ruling, which Trump\u2019s lawyers plan to appeal, means that attorneys for Zervos may have the opportunity to question Trump under oath in the coming months. The current schedule sets a deadline of June 28 for depositions, with document and electronic discovery expected to be concluded by the end of July.\u201d -- Unsealed documents from a Russian businessman\u2019s libel lawsuit against BuzzFeed News have shed new light on how the DNC emails were hacked during the 2016 election. Rosalind S. Helderman, Tom Hamburger and Ellen Nakashima report: \u201cThe documents include a forensic analysis by a former top official in the FBI\u2019s cybercrime division, which concluded that a Web server company owned by a Russian Internet entrepreneur was used by Russian operatives to hack Democratic Party leaders. The Russian businessman, Aleksej Gubarev, has denied involvement in the hack, and his lawyers argued for months that the forensic analysis should be kept under seal and hidden from public view. \u2026 A federal judge sided with BuzzFeed in the libel suit in December. \u2026 Gubarev has appealed the decision, but in the meantime the New York Times asked that the judge unseal evidence that had been submitted in the case.\u201d -- The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee released the transcript from a closed-door interview with former FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok in which he argued that text messages he sent expressing disdain for Trump have been misconstrued to be more disparaging than intended. Karoun Demirjian, Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report: \u201cIn the June interview, Strzok also vehemently objected to the Justice Department inspector general\u2019s conclusion that he had prioritized the bureau\u2019s Trump investigation, which he led, over an investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, which he joined midstream. Strzok argued that he \u2018never took resources off one and put it onto the other\u2019 but that \u2018a hostile foreign power \u2026 seeking to clandestinely influence our presidential election\u2019 was a far graver threat than the charge that Clinton was mishandling classified information.\u201d\u00a0 -- Roger Stone\u2019s trial has been scheduled to start on Nov. 5. Spencer S. Hsu reports: \u201cU.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington said the trial would be expected to last at least two weeks on the accusations that Stone lied about his efforts to gather information about hacked Democratic Party emails during the 2016 presidential campaign.\u201d -- Facebook\u2019s top product executive is leaving the company, marking the social media giant\u2019s highest-level departure as it continues to grapple with the fallout of mishandling user data during the 2016 election. Elizabeth Dwoskin reports: \u201c[Chris] Cox\u2019s unexpected departure, which he and [Mark] Zuckerberg announced in separate Facebook posts Thursday, comes months after Cox was promoted in a major reorganization. In May, Cox was put in charge of Facebook\u2019s \u2018family of apps,\u2019 including Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Facebook itself \u2014 which together have over 2.7 billion users worldwide. These apps have been distinct until recently, when Zuckerberg announced plans to unify them with a new focus on privacy. \u2026 A person familiar with discussions at the company said Cox and [another departing executive] objected to unifying the apps.\u201d -- Related: Facebook blamed server issues for prolonged outages from Wednesday until Thursday afternoon on apps like Instagram and WhatsApp.\u00a0(Hamza Shaban) ALL THE PRESIDENT\u2019S MEN AND WOMEN: -- Trump drew criticism for hinting in an interview with Breitbart that his supporters could turn violent against his Democratic opponents if pushed too far. \u201cI can tell you, I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump \u2013 I have the tough people, but they don\u2019t play it tough until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut the left plays it cuter and tougher.\u201d (Aaron Blake) -- House Democrats believe Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross still isn\u2019t being honest about the origins of the citizenship question that the administration is trying to add to the 2020 Census. At the end of a 6 1\/2-hour hearing last night, Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) gave Ross until Tuesday to produce documents or face a subpoena. Tara Bahrampour reports: \u201cDemocrats focused on emails showing that Ross discussed adding the citizenship question with Trump administration officials early in 2017. In the emails, he expressed frustration that it was not happening quickly enough, and said he would discuss it with then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. When pressed about his emails, memos and related discussions, Ross frequently said that he didn\u2019t remember or the discussions were confidential. \u201cMembers of the House committee ... pointed to congressional hearings last spring at which he testified that his move to add the question came solely in response to a December 2017 request from the Justice Department. Litigation around the question later produced emails showing that Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, had been pushing for the question for months before that. \u2018You can\u2019t lie to Congress,\u2019 Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) said to Ross. \u2018Michael Cohen lied to Congress and now he\u2019s going to prison.\u2019\u201d -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would \u201cprotect\u201d Trump if House Democrats seek the president's tax returns. The AP\u2019s Marcy Gordon reports: \u201cAt a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, Mnuchin was asked whether he would meet a request for Trump\u2019s past tax returns. Chairman Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., is expected to formally ask for those as Democrats seek to shed light on Trump\u2019s financial dealings and potential conflicts of interest. \u2018We will examine the request and we will follow the law ... and we will protect the president as we would protect any taxpayer\u2019 regarding their right to privacy, Mnuchin said. \u2026 But Mnuchin did not specifically say he would turn them over.\u201d -- Former RNC finance chairman Steve Wynn met with Mnuchin and his team about a proposal that could reduce his personal tax burden months after he was forced to sell his stake in his casino empire amid sexual misconduct accusations. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Richard Rubin and Alexandra Berzon report: \u201cMr. Wynn met with senior Treasury officials on June 4 to discuss \u2018opportunity zones,\u2019 a break that was part of the 2017 Republican tax overhaul. The opportunity-zone program gives individuals a chance to defer and reduce capital-gains taxes if they make investments into low-income areas. Mr. Wynn \u2026 attended the meeting in the Treasury building with Daniel Kowalski, a counselor to [Mnuchin] who was helping write opportunity-zone regulations. Mr. Mnuchin stopped by the meeting to greet Mr. Wynn, according to a copy of the secretary\u2019s calendar that the department periodically releases.\u201d -- Mnuchin\u2019s work with the international film industry could pose conflict of interest concerns. The New York Times\u2019s Alan Rappeport and Ana Swanson report: \u201c[A]s Treasury secretary and one of the lead negotiators in trade talks with China, Mr. Mnuchin has been personally pushing Beijing to give the American film industry greater access to its markets \u2014 a change that could be highly lucrative to his former industry. While Mr. Mnuchin divested from his Hollywood film-financing firm after joining the Trump administration, he maintains ties to the industry through his wife, the actress and filmmaker Louise Linton. In 2017, Mr. Mnuchin sold his interest in the film production company StormChaser Partners to Ms. Linton, who at the time was his fianc\u00e9e.\u201d -- Former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who resigned after both of his ex-wives accused him of physical abuse, wrote an op-ed praising Trump\u2019s approach to China for today\u2019s Wall Street Journal. -- A\u00a0Miami prosecutor who helped Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta craft a lenient plea deal for alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was previously admonished for her handling of another child sexual abuse case. It turns out that Acosta was not only aware of the rebuke, but he even defended her. The Miami Herald\u2019s Julie K. Brown reports: \u201cThe prosecutor, A. Marie Villafa\u00f1a, was harshly rebuked by a federal judge in January 2007 for what he called her \u2018intentional and\/or serious lapse in judgment\u2019 when she failed to explicitly inform him that the defendant, a Texas man who traveled to Florida to have sex with a 14-year-old girl, had a prior history of predatory behavior with minors, court records show. Acosta, her boss at the time, not only knew about Villafa\u00f1a\u2019s breach, but records show that he subsequently defended it.\u201d Detained immigrant children line up in the cafeteria at the Karnes County Residential Center. (Eric Gay\/AP) THE IMMIGRATION WARS: -- ICE officials are considering phasing out family detention at the Karnes County Residential Center in Texas, a move that would lower the government\u2019s capacity to hold migrant parents with their children. Nick Miroff and Maria Sacchetti: \u201cICE would instead use the Karnes facility to house easier-to-deport single adults \u2026 The Karnes facility is one of two large family \u2018residential centers\u2019 ICE operates in South Texas, with a current detainee population of 528 adults and children. Families held there would be issued notices to appear in immigration court and would then be released into the U.S. interior, according to two officials with knowledge of the discussions. \u2026 The plan under discussion comes days after the Trump administration rolled out a budget proposal with the goal of expanding the number of family detention beds to 10,000.\u201d\u00a0 -- The Congressional Hispanic Caucus called for an investigation into the Trump Organization\u2019s use of undocumented labor, criticizing the Department of Homeland Security and calling on authorities to protect the fired workers from deportation. Joshua Partlow: \u201cRep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) and four other Democratic members of the caucus wrote a letter Tuesday to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray and to the acting inspector general of DHS. \u2018Many of the Trump Organization employees have stepped forward to recount how the Trump Organization setup a pipeline to systematically obtain cheap immigrant labor and hired undocumented immigrants,\u2019 the letter said. \u2018This is clear evidence that the hiring of undocumented immigrants was not a one-time oversight but that this was done methodically and with a deliberate violation of the law. \u2026 it is critical that the victims and witnesses of the alleged criminal and civil violations be protected as material witnesses. \u2026 Some of the Trump Organization employees have been interviewed by the New York and New Jersey attorneys general\u2019s offices in recent weeks, according to their attorney, Anibal Romero. But neither has announced a formal investigation of the company\u2019s hiring practices.\u201d -- Acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan appeared before Congress to make the case for a $750 billion defense budget, but he found himself under fire instead for the president\u2019s decision to divert money from the military budget to build his wall. Paul Sonne reports: \u201cShanahan, who is hoping to receive Trump\u2019s nomination to serve in his post on a permanent basis, sought to placate Democratic lawmakers who fumed at the Pentagon\u2019s failure to indicate what military construction projects could be delayed.\u201d\u00a0 -- The majority of people in 18 nations surveyed by the Pew Research Center believe that immigrants strengthen their countries, rather than burdening them, including in the United States. Emily Guskin reports: \u201cA median of 56 percent of people said immigrants were a strength to their country, while 38 percent said immigrants were a burden. In the United States, opinion didn\u2019t differ much from countries overall \u2026 Across the countries, 50 percent said immigrants are no more to blame for crime than other groups, while 37 percent said immigrants are more to blame for crime than others. Americans were more likely to say that immigrants were not more to blame for crime \u2026 Majorities in many of the countries studied thought immigrants in their countries illegally should be deported, including 7 of the 10 European Union countries surveyed. \u2026 Americans were more divided about deportation \u2014 opinions were about split in the U.S.\u201d\u00a0 -- A high school student duped the Texas\u00a0lieutenant governor, one of the state's most powerful Republicans,\u00a0into posing with a sign that said \u201cAbolish ICE.\u201d\u00a0The student and budding activist said he told Lt.

The former Texas congressman chatted with voters (in English and Spanish) and introduced himself to some who had never heard about him at all. Jenna Johnson and Matt Viser followed him around: \u201cThe day, launched by an early-morning video announcing his candidacy, was an effort to re-create the electricity of his recent run for the Senate, which made him a celebrity even as he narrowly lost. And it kicked off a test of whether the same freewheeling style can work amid the heightened pressures and scrutiny of a presidential campaign. \u2026 Throughout the day, O\u2019Rourke introduced himself as \u2018Beto from El Paso,\u2019 took questions and began collecting stories that he built into a campaign-speech-in-the-making, modifying it from stop to stop to mention those he had just met. \u2026 O\u2019Rourke said he plans to travel the country in the days ahead and will host a more official kickoff event in El Paso on March 30.\u201d -- O\u2019Rourke told Gayle King that voting in 2020 is the best way to \u201cresolve\u201d Trump in\u00a0his first interview\u00a0after announcing his campaign.\u00a0\u201cHow Congress chooses to address those set of facts and the findings which I believe [we] are soon to see from the Mueller report is up to them,\u201d O'Rourke told King. \u201cI think the American people are going to have a chance to decide this at the ballot box in November 2020, and perhaps that's the best way for us to resolve these outstanding questions.\u201d -- Important story: O\u2019Rourke\u2019s early political career depended on the financial backing not from liberal online donors but from wealthy conservative\u00a0executives. \u201cBorn into one politically potent family and married into another, he benefited repeatedly from his relationships with ... several nationally known Republican moneymen,\u201d\u00a0Michael Scherer reports. \u201cSeveral of El Paso\u2019s richest business moguls donated to and raised money for O\u2019Rourke\u2019 s city council campaigns, drawn to his support for a plan to redevelop El Paso\u2019s poorer neighborhoods. Some later backed a super PAC that would play a key role in helping him defeat an incumbent Democratic congressman. For his part, O\u2019Rourke worked on issues that had the potential to make money for some of his benefactors. His support as a council member for the redevelopment plan, which sparked controversy at the time because it involved relocating low-income residents, many of them Hispanic, coincided with property investments by some of his benefactors. \u2026 As a congressman, O\u2019Rourke supported a $2 billion military funding increase that benefited a company controlled by another major donor. That donor, real estate developer Woody Hunt, was friends with O\u2019Rourke\u2019s late father. Hunt also co-founded and funds an El Paso nonprofit organization that has employed O\u2019Rourke\u2019s wife since 2016.\u201d\u00a0 -- O\u2019Rourke\u2019s narrow Senate loss last year demonstrated how Texas is undergoing a political transformation, but it's more because of college-educated white voters than Hispanics. From the New York Times\u2019s Nate Cohn: \u201cMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s strong showing had essentially nothing to do with the initial vision of a Blue Texas powered by mobilizing the state\u2019s growing Hispanic population. The Texas electorate was only two points more Hispanic in 2018 than it was in 2012, but President Obama lost the state by 16 points in 2012, compared with Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s 2.6-point loss. \u2026 Instead, Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s improvement came almost exclusively from white voters, and particularly college-educated white voters. Whites probably gave him around 33 percent of their votes, up from a mere 22 percent for Mr. Obama in 2012.\u201d Rosario Dawson attends a Bernie Sanders rally in the Bronx in March 2016.

Bernie Sanders's\u00a0wife and his son, is shutting down amid growing criticism that the organization blurred the lines between the Sanders family, campaigning and fundraising. From the AP's Steve Peoples and Stephen Braun: \u201cJane Sanders said the institute will not accept more money so long as her husband is a presidential candidate. [Sanders' son David] Driscoll and the organization\u2019s two other employees would be laid off with no severance by the end of May, and its Burlington, Vermont, office would be closed, she said. Sanders said questions of nepotism have no merit because the senator himself played no role in the organization, which was led by an independent board of directors.\u201d -- Sen. Sanders (I-Vt.) pushed for the nationalization of most major U.S. industries in the 1970s, a far more radical position than he espouses now. CNN\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski and Nathan McDermott report: \u201cAfter moving to Vermont in 1968 several years after graduating college, Sanders became an active member of the left-wing Liberty Union Party. \u2026 Sanders and Liberty Union argued for nationalization of the energy industry, public ownership of banks, telephone, electric, and drug companies and of the major means of production such as factories and capital, as well as other proposals such as a 100% income tax on the highest income earners in America.\u201d -- One of the moms implicated in the college admissions scandal held a fundraiser for Sen.

Despite the early polling, they\u2019ve argued the increasingly left-leaning Democratic primary electorate won\u2019t settle on a 76-year-old white man already facing renewed scrutiny over his prior record on issues like criminal justice and race. \u2026 Some of Trump\u2019s advisers have even compared Biden to Jeb Bush.\u201d -- The Post created an interactive graphic to track where each of the 2020 Democrats stand on Medicare-for-all. -- New polling shows that most independent voters lean toward one of the two major political parties. From the Pew Research Center: \u201cAmong the public overall, 38% describe themselves as independents, while 31% are Democrats and 26% call themselves Republicans, according to Pew Research Center surveys conducted in 2018. \u2026 An overwhelming majority of independents (81%) continue to \u2018lean\u2019 toward either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party.

It\u2019s not illegal to drive with the mildest of buzzes, but if you get into an accident, that small amount of substance can get you into big trouble.\u00a0Ultimately, it\u2019s not always easy to figure out if a crime has been committed.

Unlike the messy Republican field of 2016 \u2014 which featured hordes of milquetoast party-liners and a few cringeworthy personalities alongside one outsize reality-show star \u2014 this year\u2019s Democratic field is generally fiery ideologists appealing to varying factions within the party.

Sun: \u201cThe White House\u2019s 2020 budget request \u2026 does propose an additional $291\u00a0million as a down payment for a\u00a0new HIV initiative. Yet the $4.7\u00a0trillion budget also calls for sharp spending reductions to Medicaid \u2026 Such a contradiction \u2014 giving while also taking away \u2014 runs through the budget arithmetic for many of the Trump administration\u2019s health-care priorities. In addition to combating HIV, the president has taken aim at childhood cancer and the opioid crisis, but his budget would undermine all those efforts by shrinking the health infrastructure that people struggling with those issues rely on while throttling back national cancer research spending.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT: \u201cDemocrats upset with Omar are seeking someone to primary her,\u201d from the Hill: \u201cSome Minnesota Democrats, aghast at controversial comments made by Rep.

Several party leaders said they have had discussions about finding a candidate to take on Omar, just two months into her first term in Congress. \u2026 Some Democrats are eyeing Bobby Joe Champion, a state senator who has served in the legislature for a decade.

These lawyers, many of whom have experience in sprawling investigations like this one, however, said that whatever happens, Mueller is likely to hew tightly to the letter of the law:\u00a0\u201cHe is by-the-book-Bob. So you want to start with the presumption that he will look at these regulations and follow them very literally and closely,\u201d said one former Justice Department prosecutor.\u00a0 Lawyers we talked to have a couple of reminders for breathless lawmakers, readers and us journalists: the whole report\u00a0may not be released publicly, and Mueller is unlikely to recommend charges against President Trump, regardless of what evidence he does or does not uncover. But the prosecutors told Power Up to expect a slew of subpoenas and potentially charged litigation that could make its way to the Supreme Court. Important: Trump and his allies have spent months calling the probe a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and trying to undermine the special counsel's work. But the investigation has so far led to criminal charges against 34 people (many of them Russians unlikely to be extradited) and six\u00a0advisers and Trump associates have pleaded guilty.\u00a0 Here's what the prosecutors told me to expect: 1. The Barr Factor: It's up to new Attorney General William Barr\u00a0to decide whether to release all, some or\u00a0none of the Mueller report.\u00a0 2. Expect a tug of war with Congress and Justice \u2014 and potentially the courts \u2014 regarding full access to\u00a0the report.\u00a0 3. Mueller is not likely to recommend criminal charges against Trump. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a crime or not is beside the point\u00a0because they\u2019re not going to\u00a0prosecute him anyway,\u201d a former prosecutor at the\u00a0DOJ told us of Trump.\u00a0 Mueller \u201cis a rules follower and he\u2019d be careful to refrain from doing or saying anything than operating outside of the prescribed legal scope of his authority,\u201d another former DOJ prosecutor us. \u201cAccording to people familiar with the special counsel\u2019s work, Mueller has envisioned it as an investigative assignment, not necessarily a prosecutorial one, and for that reason does not plan to keep the office running to see to the end all of the indictments it has filed,\u201d Devlin,\u00a0Josh\u00a0and Matt\u00a0report.\u00a0 4. There will be\u00a0a lot of loose ends. \u00a0And \"the end of the special counsel\u2019s probe would not mean the end of criminal investigations connected to the president,\" my\u00a0colleagues report. In other words:\u00a0\"It means the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end,\" former acting solicitor general Neal Katyal tweeted.  IN OTHER NEWS, A COHEN UPDATE: Michael Cohen, Trump's former fixer and longtime lawyer,\u00a0will testify publicly before the House Oversight Committee on Feb. 27 in a\u00a0blockbuster showdown featuring his long-term relationship with the president.

'LIES, RACISM, CHEATING':\u00a0That's just one of the explosive headlines that could emerge from President Trump's longtime fixer, Michael Cohen, when he launches his testimony tour on\u00a0Capitol Hill today. Cohen turned against Trump when he pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about the timeline of the possible Trump Tower project in Moscow. And he \u201cmade the extraordinary admission\u201d in August that Trump directed him to make payments to two women who alleged they had affairs with Trump to stop them from speaking before the 2016 election.

Cohen is expected to\u00a0\u201cdescribe to lawmakers what he views as Trump\u2019s 'lies, racism and cheating,'\u00a0both as president and in private business, and will describe 'personal, behind-the-scenes'\u00a0interactions he witnessed,\u201d\u00a0a person familiar with the matter told Matt and Roz.\u00a0 You read that right: The Wall Street Journal writes that Cohen is expected to accuse Trump of criminal conduct while he was in office and would\u00a0\u201cbe the first time Mr. Cohen alleges that Mr. Trump committed a crime while in office.\u201d The schedule: Cohen will start his week in\u00a0front of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, followed by a hearing before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday, ending with testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. Only Wednesday's hearing will be public, and will be starting just as Trump has wrapped his first day of meetings with North Korean Leader\u00a0Kim Jong Un in Vietnam.\u00a0 Expectations: Republicans will be working overtime to attack Cohen's credibility.

The sweep across eastern North Carolina was one of the most aggressive voting-fraud crackdowns by a Trump-appointed prosecutor \u2014 and also a deliberate choice that demonstrates where the administration\u2019s priorities stand. At the time of the arrests, an organized ballot-tampering effort that state officials had repeatedly warned about was allegedly gearing up in the same part of North Carolina. The operation burst into public view after Election Day in November when the state elections board, citing irregularities in the mail-in vote, refused to certify the results of the 9th Congressional District race. That seat remains unfilled while state officials investigate. The decision by U.S. Attorney Robert Higdon Jr. to focus his office\u2019s resources on the prosecution of noncitizens rather than the ballot-tampering allegations in Bladen County comes amid a broad push by President Trump and other Republicans to portray illegal voting as a widespread phenomenon that threatens the integrity of American elections. After the August arrests, Higdon issued subpoenas for millions of records of foreign-born voters from state and local agencies \u2014 a request North Carolina officials have said will consume an enormous amount of time and costs millions of dollars. In Texas last week, state officials announced that more than 50,000 noncitizens may have voted in state elections over a 22-year period, though they subsequently revised those numbers considerably. A Washington Post examination of the effort in North Carolina found a complicated portrait of who is voting illegally and why \u2014 and exposed systemic problems that allowed noncitizens to register and cast ballots, in some cases without knowing they were breaking the law. All but one of those arrested are legal residents of the United States, including a man from Italy who had passed the citizenship test but had not been sworn in. Four others said they had been urged to vote by campaign workers or election volunteers and did not realize they were breaking the law. So far, the voting-fraud prosecutions have netted minimal penalties: The five defendants who have been sentenced received minimal fines, mis\u00addemeanor convictions and no jail time. Still, those convicted said the experience sent a powerful message. \u201cI want to tell my people: Don\u2019t vote,\u201d Solano-Rodriguez said after he pleaded guilty in federal court in Raleigh on Jan.\u00a017 to a misdemeanor charge. He was fined $100. A legal resident of the United States who lives in Raleigh with his U.S.-born wife and three children and runs a successful landscaping business, he added: \u201cThey tell you, \u2018You can vote.\u2019 But don\u2019t do it.\u201d Immigrant advocates said the federal investigation in North Carolina has wasted tax dollars and targeted legal residents for offenses that are minor but could result in their deportation. One green-card holder from Mexico who was prosecuted for illegal voting by Higdon\u2019s office in an earlier case has been held at a detention center since his August sentencing. Higdon has declined repeated requests for comment. But in a statement announcing that sentencing, he said: \u201cThe right to vote is a precious privilege available only to citizens of the United States. When a noncitizen votes in a federal election it serves to dilute and devalue the vote of American citizens and places the decision-making authority of the American electorate in the hands of those who have no right to make those choices.\u201d Higdon spent nearly 24 years as a career federal prosecutor, serving at one point on the team that unsuccessfully prosecuted former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards for campaign finance crimes. In 2015, he joined a law firm in Raleigh. Rep. George Holding (R-N.C.), who served as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District before running for Congress in 2012, described Higdon as a \u201cconsummate, professional career prosecutor.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s in\u00adcred\u00adibly competent,\u201d Holding said in an interview. Following Trump\u2019s election, Higdon discussed the U.S. attorney job with staff members for North Carolina\u2019s two Republican senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis, as well as with Tillis directly, according to written testimony Higdon submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Tillis and Burr subsequently submitted his name for consideration, Higdon wrote. Neither senator\u2019s office responded to requests for comment. Trump nominated Higdon in August 2017. By that time, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had made clear one of his top priorities for the Justice Department: to prosecute immigration crimes. \u201cI ask that you increase your efforts in this area,\u201d Sessions wrote in an April 2017 memo to all federal prosecutors. At his October 2017 swearing-in ceremony, Higdon echoed Sessions, emphasizing the risk posed by undocumented immigrants. \u201cSome are here committing crimes among us now,\u201d he warned in his speech. As U.S. attorney, Higdon has been regarded as a by-the-book prosecutor \u2014 but also someone guided by what Washington wanted, according to lawyers who have worked with his office. \u201cHe would always say by name, \u2018President Trump and Attorney General Sessions have directed that we do X, Y and Z, and we\u2019re going to do that,\u2019\u200a\u201d said a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District who requested anonymity to describe internal discussions. \u201cAnd he would note that during meetings \u2014 how things are going to change in the office.\u201d By the time Higdon assumed his post,\u00a0the U.S. attorney\u2019s office had obtained information indicating that some noncitizens had voted in the previous election. A state audit released in April 2017, conducted by the State Board of Elections after Trump and other Republicans claimed that as many as 3\u00a0million ineligible voters had cast ballots the previous year, detailed a list of irregularities in the North Carolina vote \u2014 some more serious than others. The audit found that out of more than 4.5\u00a0million total ballots cast in 2016, more than 400 suspected felons and 41 noncitizens had voted improperly. The audit also found 34 cases in which voters flagged as non\u00adcitizens by local election officials were actually eligible voters. State officials also found two cases of voter impersonation and 24 cases of double-voting. And the audit flagged \u201cirregularities affecting absentee by-mail voting in Bladen County.\u201d It was one of several warnings that federal officials had received about ballot tampering in the 9th District, as The Post has previously reported. Former associates and voters told The Post that a GOP operative named Leslie McCrae Dowless paid workers in both 2016 and 2018 to collect mail-in ballots from voters, then turned in some of the ballots and\u00a0possibly discarded others. It is a felony under both North Carolina and federal law to tamper with another voter\u2019s ballot. \u00a0An attorney for Dowless has denied that he broke any laws, adding that \u201ccurrent ongoing investigations will prove the same.\u201d Frustrated state investigators said they saw little interest from Higdon\u2019s office in pursuing the case. \u201cHis office is extremely interested in noncitizens who vote and made a huge deal out of that and subpoenaed all kinds of documents, but he has no interest in this other matter? It\u2019s cherry-picking,\u201d said Marshall Tutor, an investigator for the state elections board who retired in March. The elections board has declined to certify the results in the 9th District while it continues to investigate the alleged irregularities. Republican Mark Harris leads Democrat Dan McCready by just 905 votes in the unofficial count. Harris had hired Dowless to run his absentee-ballot program. A hearing on the investigation is expected this month. The audit of the 2016 vote in North Carolina did lead to one known federal investigation, according to court records: the Eastern District\u2019s probe into voting by noncitizens. Most of the 20 arrested last August by federal agents were immigrants from Latin American or Caribbean countries, but noncitizens from Japan, South Korea, Germany, Poland, the Philippines, Italy and Nigeria were also charged in the operation. The Post interviewed multiple defendants, as well as defense attorneys representing those charged, and attended four sentencing hearings. \u201cIt was a nightmare that I will never get over,\u201d George recalled of the experience.\u00a0 George, who had been feeding her animals when she was arrested, was allowed to change her clothes before she was taken away, but only with a federal agent watching her, she said in an interview. All her neighbors saw the commotion, George, 70, recalled. She sat in the courthouse in Wilmington for the better part of the day without food or water. When her initial appearance finally came in the late afternoon, a magistrate postponed the proceedings for two weeks so the court could find a Korean interpreter. She was charged with voting in federal elections in 2008, 2010 and 2016.\u00a0She recalled that she voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. A housekeeper who met her American husband 20 years ago at the hospital where they both worked, George said she was encouraged to register to vote in 2008 by a member of her church. Public defender Sherri Alspaugh said George did not know she was breaking the law. When George presented her residency card, driver\u2019s license and Social Security card to register, the person processing her application accepted it, Alspaugh said during a court hearing last month. \u201cSo they see a green card and they say, \u2018That\u2019s fine, you can register\u2019?\u201d\u00a0U.S. District Judge Terrence W. Boyle asked Alspaugh. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Alspaugh replied. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing!\u201d\u00a0the judge said. George pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor count of \u201cvoting while alien.\u201d Boyle fined her $100. Fourteen of the defendants have required interpreters at multiple hearings, court records show. On Jan. 17, a Korean interpreter drove to Raleigh from Northern Virginia for George\u2019s third and final court appearance. Another defendant, Ni\u00adger\u00adian native Elizabeth Amachaghi, needed an interpreter in her native language, Ibo, to be flown to North Carolina from the West Coast, her attorney said. Interpreters in Japanese, Haitian Creole, Tagalog and Spanish have also been called in for court appearances, records show. One of the first to be sentenced was Italian immigrant Alessandro Cannizzaro, who has lived legally in the Raleigh area since 2000. Cannizzaro, who is married to a U.S. citizen and has two children, applied for citizenship in 2003. He passed the test but was told he had to come back to take the oath because the room was too full, according to a transcript of his October sentencing hearing. \u201cI called and called to check on it, and they said I had to wait,\u201d Cannizzaro said at the hearing last fall, according to a transcript. \u201cI never received any notification.\u201d When his family went to vote in the 2016 presidential election, \u201cI joined them to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cI never checked the status .\u2009.\u2009. so I\u2019m here today to take full responsibility.\u201d\u00a0 He pleaded guilty to voting while alien. Boyle fined him $200. Four more sentencings came before Boyle in his Raleigh courtroom over two days in mid-January, including that of Solano-Rodriguez \u2014 who never signed a voter-registration application at all, public defender James Todd said. His client was at work the day someone from a voter-registration drive showed up at his home to register a number of people attending a party there, Todd said. Solano-Rodriguez doesn\u2019t know how a form was filled out on his behalf, his lawyer added. When Solano-Rodriguez received a card from the Wake County Board of Elections indicating he was registered, he assumed he was supposed to vote, Todd said. At one point during George\u2019s sentencing hearing, Boyle chastised Assistant U.S. Attorney Sebastian Kielmanovich, who was representing Higdon\u2019s office in court that day. \u201cMaybe as much attention as is focused on illegal voting should be focused on management of elections so they are not encouraging people to vote who are not eligible to vote,\u201d the judge said. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Kielmanovich responded.\u00a0 Kielmanovich declined to comment to The Post. Most of the remaining defendants, many of whom could not be reached for comment, have pleaded guilty to misdemeanors and are awaiting sentencing. Two remaining defendants face felonies. One, an undocumented immigrant from the Dominican Republic, has pleaded guilty to assuming the identity of a legal resident, obtaining a passport and voting. The other, a native of Mexico, was charged with applying for citizenship after having voted improperly in a federal election. Numerous\u00a0studies\u00a0indicate that illegal voting is rare, making the recent prosecutions by Higdon\u2019s office unusual. Before those cases, only 40 noncitizens had been convicted of voting illegally since 1992, including two in North Carolina \u2014 one in 2003 and another in 2018, according to the conservative Heritage Foundation, which tracks voting fraud.\u00a0 David Iglesias, a former U.S. attorney in New Mexico under President George W. Bush, said the North Carolina number is \u201chuge\u201d when compared with historical patterns. Iglesias established a voter-fraud task force when he was a federal prosecutor, but he said he did not end up prosecuting anyone. \u201cThese cases are hard,\u201d said Iglesias, now a professor at Wheaton College in Illinois. \u201cThey are not serious cases in the bigger scheme of things. They\u2019re rare.\u201d However, other high-profile convictions of noncitizen voters are popping up elsewhere \u2014 driven in part, immigration advocates say, by Trump\u2019s rhetoric.\u00a0 In Texas last year, a jury\u00a0sentenced\u00a0Rosa Ortega, a permanent resident originally from Mexico, to eight years for voting illegally in state elections in 2012 and 2014 \u2014 including for Ken Paxton, the Republican attorney general who prosecuted her case. She is set to be deported after serving her time. The emphasis in North Carolina on voting by immigrants instead of the alleged ballot-tampering operation in the 9th District has drawn criticism from congressional Democrats.\u00a0 At a Senate confirmation hearing last month for attorney general nominee William P. Barr, Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), described Higdon\u2019s actions as \u201ca needle in the haystack effort to prosecute voting by non\u00adcitizens.\u201d\u00a0 She later told The Post that prosecutors should have been \u201clooking at the fraud that was right in front of their faces,\u201d referring to the alleged irregularities in the 9th District.\u00a0\u00a0 Barr responded in the hearing that, if confirmed, he would examine the merits of the investigation. Some conservatives have also urged a more evenhanded approach. Jay DeLancy, who leads the North Carolina-based Voter Integrity Project and advocates for stricter laws, such as voter ID requirements, said he supports prosecution of intentional voter misconduct, and he applauded Higdon for bringing the cases. But DeLancy also said the North Carolina prosecutions don\u2019t get at the real problem \u2014 what he described as lax voter registration procedures that make it too easy for ineligible voters to unintentionally break the law.\u00a0 \u201cThey are setting up a lot of noncitizens for failure,\u201d DeLancy said. \u201cThese are sympathetic \u00adcases.\u201d The focus on noncitizen voting in North Carolina did not end with the 20 charges that Higdon\u2019s office filed in August. About a week after the arrests, the Eastern District issued far-reaching subpoenas seeking more than 15\u00a0million voting records from the state Department of Motor Vehicles, the State Board of Elections and 44 county election boards within Higdon\u2019s jurisdiction in eastern North Carolina. Working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the subpoenas targeted all foreign-born North Carolinians who have tried to register to vote since 2010. State elections officials called it a vast and burdensome demand that would cost state and local governments millions of dollars \u2014 in addition to potentially chilling registration and participation among eligible voters. The state is fighting the subpoenas in court. \u201cCompiling records would have burdened state and county elections administration \u2014 commandeering staff-time for weeks,\u201d said Josh Lawson, general counsel for the State Board of Elections. Meanwhile, those prosecuted for noncitizen voting in the state are now at risk of being deported, even if they are here legally, immigration attorneys said. Among them is Roberto Hernandez-Cuarenta, a 57-year-old landscaper from Mexico who has lived in the United States legally since 1992. Charged in 2017, before Higdon took office, he pleaded no contest in August to two misdemeanor charges of illegal voting, two weeks before the 20 other voter-fraud arrests. His sentencing triggered deportation proceedings, and he has been held in an ICE detention center in Georgia since, according to his attorneys. Andrew McCoppin, Hernandez-Cuarenta\u2019s defense lawyer, said his client filled out a registration application at the state\u2019s motor vehicle department and was told when he went to the polls that he was registered to vote. Hernandez-Cuarenta also spent six months in county jail in 2009 and 2010 on misdemeanor charges of assault and resisting an officer, public records show.\u00a0 The detention center where he is being kept is roughly 600 miles from his wife of about 30 years, who is a U.S. citizen, said his immigration lawyer, Marty Rosenbluth. A preliminary hearing on his residency status is scheduled for Feb. 18.\u00a0 McCoppin believes his client\u2019s legal status may have expired since he has been in custody. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the government is expending resources on prosecuting long-term legal residents who didn\u2019t realize they couldn\u2019t vote and were voting because they felt pride in the U.S.,\u201d McCoppin said. \u201cDeporting them would be such a disproportionate penalty for a minor offense.\u201d","126":"President Trump on Monday will propose major spending cuts across a range of domestic government programs while seeking a large increase for the Pentagon, a budget plan that\u2019s already encountering withering opposition from Democrats who control the House, as well as some Republicans. The budget has little chance of becoming law because of bipartisan resistance to many of its elements, but it sets forth the White House\u2019s vision ahead of what is expected to be a fierce battle over government spending later this year. Even with deep spending cuts, the president\u2019s plan would not balance the budget until the mid-2030s, two people briefed on the plan said, falling short of the 10-year time frame that Republicans have sought for years. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plan ahead of its public release. Instead, Trump\u2019s advisers say the budget would balance after 15\u00a0years because they presume that economic growth will continue at high levels and bring in more revenue, a prediction that many economists have said is not possible. Still, the White House\u2019s new 15-year deficit target illustrates the fiscal constraints of an agenda that prioritizes tax cuts and increased defense spending while simultaneously protecting big-ticket items like Medicare from any major changes. The proposal is Trump\u2019s first comprehensive budget blueprint since Democrats took control of the House in January. Unlike in the past two years, White House officials say they plan to forcefully fight for the proposed cuts, hoping to draw a sharp contrast with Democrats on Capitol Hill. And the White House plans to expand its effort to cut anti-poverty programs. It will propose strict new work requirements for \u201cable-bodied\u201d Americans across a range of welfare programs, including health care, housing and nutrition assistance. Many Republicans have said these programs are bloated with waste and discourage people from returning to work. But Democrats have fiercely opposed such requirements in the past, saying they penalize the poor and strip benefits from those in need. Democrats \u2014 and even some Republicans \u2014 are already girding for battle with the Trump administration over many of the other proposed reductions, which they say are draconian and would severely restrict a range of government programs, from food assistance to foreign aid. \u201cClearly it\u2019s a nonstarter in the House,\u201d said Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), adding that Democrats have no plans to include the domestic spending cuts. \u201cObviously we\u2019re going to disregard it.\u201d Complicating matters for the White House, key Republicans this week signaled that parts of the budget plan would be met with a visceral reaction from both parties once it is formally presented. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to maintain a straight face with that kind of proposal,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a member of the House Appropriations Committee. Presidential budgets are routinely rebuffed by Capitol Hill, and Trump\u2019s previous efforts have been no exception. The White House has proposed cuts previously, but officials have backed down and agreed to bipartisan deals to increase spending. Administration officials are hoping to pivot to targeting spending this time around, particularly as the 2020 election nears and they try to draw Democrats into a debate about the size of government. \u201cTime and again, Congress has ignored presidential cost-saving recommendations and plowed ahead with irresponsible budgets that increase both spending and the size of government. This needs to stop,\u201d acting White House budget director Russell T. Vought wrote in a recent opinion piece. \u201cIt is time for Congress to join the president in his commitment to cutting spending.\u201d Lawmakers have funded the government through the end of September, but if the White House and Congress don\u2019t reach a new spending deal by that point, they could face another shutdown. Both parties are expected to spend the next few months detailing their proposals, and the White House will take the first step Monday. In his budget plan, Trump will propose major cuts to domestic and international programs that provide foreign aid, environmental protection and transportation, among other initiatives. Overall, the White House will seek a 5\u00a0percent reduction in spending for these programs compared with caps that were set to go into place next year. Spending for these programs must be approved by Congress each year, and many lawmakers see the proposed cuts as unlikely to get traction. \u201cCutting 5 percent of all the other programs? It\u2019d be hard. Plus you got the House, too,\u201d said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.). \u201cI think that\u2019d be a difficult task.\u201d The White House says cuts to these programs will help restrain overall spending levels, even though these programs represent a relatively small portion of the broader budget. Lawmakers eight years ago put in place budget caps on certain programs, but Congress has routinely raised those caps to prevent big cuts from going into effect. Trump will propose keeping the caps in place for the first time in his presidency, though he will also propose shifting close to $175\u00a0billion in defense and emergency money into another fund that does not face the same restrictions. A large portion would go into a fund known as Overseas Contingency Operations. The Obama administration also used this account for defense money, drawing complaints from lawmakers of both parties that the White House was relying on a budget gimmick, a point Cole repeated Friday. Yarmuth said moving such large sums into the overseas account was \u201cjust insane.\u201d He said he\u2019d warned White House budget director Mick Mulvaney against the approach, telling him, \u201cWe\u2019re going to kick your butt over this.\u201d Recent spending deals have involved Democrats accepting big Pentagon funding increases pushed by Republicans, in exchange for GOP support for comparable domestic investments. Lawmakers expect that they will ultimately reach an agreement along similar lines this time, too, which would amount to a bipartisan repudiation of the president\u2019s budget blueprint \u2014 although Democrats intend to push for even higher levels of nondefense domestic spending now that they control the House. White House officials plan to describe the president\u2019s upcoming budget as having three main elements. The first will be Trump\u2019s continued focus on border security and immigration enforcement, and he is expected to propose billions of dollars in additional spending on these initiatives, including more money for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Before Congress and the White House reached a spending deal in January, Trump led a 35-day government shutdown because Congress would not appropriate $5.7\u00a0billion for the construction of a wall. Eventually, he relented. And last month, Congress agreed to spend $1.375\u00a0billion to erect 55\u00a0miles of barriers along the Mexican border. Trump still aims to build a much more extensive series of barriers, and last month he took steps to redirect close to $7\u00a0billion in additional funding from other programs. The president reapportioned some of that money by declaring a national emergency  at the southern border, a move that infuriated many lawmakers in both parties. The House has passed a resolution that would overturn that declaration, and the Senate is set to take similar action, though Trump has the power to veto the measure and his critics lack the votes to override him. By signaling that border security will remain a major focus in the upcoming budget, White House officials show no sign of retreating from their clash with Congress over how this money should be used. Another element of the budget that White House officials plan to tout is reforms that they say are necessary to make the government more efficient and less duplicative. It could not be immediately learned what these changes would be. Finally, the plan is expected to lay out a new \u201cfiscal path\u201d for the country, a direction White House officials believe has been prompted by economic growth caused by the 2017 tax cut law and the elimination of numerous regulations. The plan will project that the economy will grow by roughly 3\u00a0percent a year, slightly higher than the level achieved in 2018 but much higher in the coming years than a range of economists have said is feasible. The Federal Reserve forecasts 2.3\u00a0percent growth for 2019. The White House budget will predict that faster economic growth will boost tax revenue past current projections, helping to reduce the deficit somewhat. White House officials say the deficit would be eliminated over 15\u00a0years if all of Trump\u2019s proposals were enacted. Trump\u2019s advisers said his first budget proposal, offered in 2017, would have eliminated the deficit within 10\u00a0years, but it was slammed by critics who decried its controversial accounting assumptions and rosy economic forecasts. The budget plan last year, like the new plan, also did not eliminate the deficit over 10\u00a0years, something that had long been a stated goal of conservatives in Congress. The federal government spends more than $4\u00a0trillion each year on a range of programs, and it will bring in slightly more than $3\u00a0trillion this year through taxes and other revenue. The gap between the two figures is called the deficit, which the government pays for with borrowed money by issuing debt. The government now has more than $22\u00a0trillion in debt, and the deficit is projected to run between $900\u00a0billion and $1\u00a0trillion in the coming years. To tackle the deficit, Republicans in the past have proposed cutting spending on large programs, such as Medicare, a health-care program for older Americans; food stamp benefits for the poor; and Medicaid, a health-care program for low-income people and those with disabilities. \u201cUntil you get serious about entitlement spending, there\u2019s just no way to balance,\u201d Cole said. Trump, however, has told aides that they cannot cut Medicare or Social Security spending in his budget because they are very popular with older Americans. That makes it much harder for his budget to constrain spending. Some Democrats have proposed reducing the deficit by raising taxes, both by reversing some tax cuts that were approved in 2017 and by adding taxes on \u00adupper-income households to finance new spending on health care, education and environmental programs.","127":"There were a lot of gasps and \u201cWow!\u201d exclamations when the U.S. Labor Department announced Friday that the economy added 304,000 jobs in January. It\u2019s a massive number of hires, and it occurred in a month when the federal government was partially shut down and hundreds of thousands of federal employees went without pay. Some of the best forecasters in the country had predicted job gains of about 170,000, a substantially lower figure. So how did this extremely good jobs report happen? Here\u2019s a brief rundown on how the shutdown did and did not affect the January unemployment report. 1. The shutdown had no impact on the 304,000 jobs number. This figure comes from a survey in which the Labor Department asks employers (both private sector and government) how many people were on the payroll for the pay period that includes Jan. 12. The furloughed federal workers were still on the payroll that day, even though they were not getting paid. The Labor Department still counted them as employed because the workers were going to be paid eventually. This whole process is known as the \u201cestablishment survey,\u201d and the Labor Department has used this methodology for previous shutdowns, which also showed no impact on monthly job gains. (Economist Martha Gimbel from Indeed.com wrote a great explainer of what happened during past shutdowns, including in 2013.) 2. The shutdown did affect the unemployment rate, which ticked up to 4 percent. The unemployment rate rose in January (up from 3.9 percent in December), and that\u2019s largely because of the shutdown. The Labor Department calculates the unemployment rate by using a different survey \u2014 known as the household survey \u2014 where they literally knock on the doors of some people\u2019s homes and ask how many adults are employed and how many are unemployed. Furloughed workers were supposed to be categorized as \u201cunemployed on temporary layoff,\u201d but the Labor Department has to use whatever language the person answering the door says. So some furloughed workers classified themselves as \u201cemployed\u201d while others said (correctly) that they were \u201cunemployed temporarily.\" The Labor Department said that some furloughed federal workers almost certainly misclassified themselves. The result is the unemployment rate probably should have been even higher \u2014 maybe 4.1 percent. \u201cIf the federal workers who were recorded as employed but absent from work had been classified as unemployed on temporary layoff, the overall unemployment rate would have been slightly higher than reported,\u201d the Labor Department wrote in a note at the bottom of the January jobs report. 3. The shutdown probably caused a jump in Americans working part time. Interestingly, there was a dramatic spike in the number of Americans working part-time jobs in January. This means they were working part time but wanted full-time work. The Labor Department reported that 490,000 more people were working part time in January but wanted full-time work, and the department noted that this \u201cmay reflect the impact of the partial federal government shutdown.\u201d This metric is closely watched as a sign of the health of the labor market, since people who want to work full time should be able to find jobs in such a \u201chot\u201d market. It is calculated from the household survey (the one where the Labor Department goes door-to-door). \u201cBlockbuster job number distorted by workers forced to accept part time employment to make ends meet during government shutdown. A whopping half million more people forced into part time instead of full time for economic reasons in January,\u201d tweeted Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. The takeaway: The shutdown had a real impact on 800,000 federal workers, and it did cause the unemployment rate to rise, but the economy still added 304,000 jobs because the private sector continues to hire at a strong pace (8,000 jobs came from the public sector, but the bulk came from private employers).","128":"In its annual report, the French Interior Ministry said last week that instances of anti-Semitic violence increased by 74 percent in 2018. On Tuesday, a Jewish cemetery was desecrated in the eastern French city of Quatzenheim, with swastikas scrawled on about 80 graves. \u201cAnti-Semitism is the opposite of what France is,\u201d Macron tweeted as he made his way to the site. Anti-Semitism has been a persistent problem in France, home to Europe\u2019s largest Jewish community. Since 2003, isolated instances of anti-Semitic violence in the country have claimed 12 lives. Successive governments have struggled to address the problem, especially as more and more French Jews have left the country for Israel. Macron\u2019s government is no exception: Despite any number of speeches and campaigns against anti-Semitism, the violence against Jews has continued. Earlier this month, a tree planted in memory of Ilan Halimi, a 23-year-old Jewish cellphone salesman murdered in 2006 by a group calling itself the \u201cgang of barbarians,\u201d was chopped down ahead of a ceremony planned to mark his death anniversary. Last week, \u201cJuden\u201d\u2014 the German word for Jew and a clear reference to Nazi anti-Semitism \u2014 was scrawled across the window of a Paris bagel shop. Swastikas were drawn on a mailbox that depicted the face of Simone Veil, a French Holocaust survivor, abortion rights advocate and national hero who died in 2017. Although authorities have not named suspects in these recent incidents, their coincidence with a weekend \u201cgilet jaune,\u201d or \u201cyellow vest,\u201d demonstration raised fears about the real motivations of a protest movement that regularly decries high finance, the media and Macron, who formerly worked at the investment bank Rothschild, a favorite target of anti-Semitic vitriol. In the past, a number of yellow vest protesters have been caught on camera making anti-Semitic gestures and saying that journalists \u201cwork for the Jews.\u201d In December, a small group of protesters harangued a Holocaust survivor on the Paris metro. This weekend, concerns about anti-Semitism within the yellow vest movement grew more acute after protesters surrounded prominent French Jewish intellectual Alain Finkielkraut as he got out of a taxi near his home in Paris on Saturday. \u201cDirty Zionist!\u201d the protesters yelled, in a scene that was caught on camera. \u201cGo back to Tel Aviv!\u201d Macron leaped to Finkielkraut\u2019s defense, writing on Twitter that the philosopher, whose parents were Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Poland and whose father survived Auschwitz, \u201cis not only an eminent man of letters but the symbol of what the republic allows everyone.\u201d \u201cThe anti-Semitic insults of which he was the object are the absolute negation of what we are and what makes us a great nation,\u201d Macron continued. \u201cWe will not tolerate them.\u201d Finkielkraut did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In Paris on Tuesday, thousands gathered in the symbolic Place de la Republique, many wielding signs that read \u201c\u00c7a Suffit!\u201d (\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d). \u201cI am not Jewish, not at all, but I\u2019m with them,\u201d said Blanca Blazic, 70, a retiree of Serbian origin who said she has lived in France for 55 years, having arrived from the former Yugoslavia. She said the number of anti-Semitic attacks today is the highest she has ever seen in France. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten worse. Granted, there was always anti-Semitism and there was always the occasional attack,\u201d Blazic said. \u201cBut now .\u2009.\u2009. We can\u2019t leave things the way they are.\u201d Some in the crowd noted with resignation the number of such demonstrations in the French capital in recent years, notably after the attack on the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket in January 2015 and after the killing of Mireille Knoll, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor, in March. For Bruno Turb\u00e9, an IT worker from the Paris suburbs, it was unclear what the latest march against anti-Semitism would accomplish, but he came anyway. \u201cIf we are numerous, it can at least shed some light on things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just do nothing.\u201d People also gathered in solidarity in the cities of Toulouse and Marseille in the south, as well as several other locations across the country.","129":"The federal budget deficit ballooned rapidly in the first four months of the fiscal year amid falling tax revenue and higher spending, the Treasury Department said Tuesday, posing a new challenge for the White House and Congress as they prepare for a number of budget battles. The deficit grew 77\u00a0percent in the first four months of fiscal 2019 compared with the same period one year before, Treasury said. The total deficit for the four-month period was $310\u00a0billion, Treasury said, up from $176\u00a0billion for the same period one year earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s big tax cuts combined with big increases in spending when they already had big deficits,\u201d said former Senate Budget Committee chairman Kent Conrad (D-N.D.). \u201cSo guess what, it\u2019s craziness!\u201d When Republicans seized control of the House of Representatives during the Obama administration, lawmakers and White House officials embarked on a number of strained negotiations to try to reduce the gap between spending and tax revenue. During the Trump administration, there have not been any similar discussions, and President Trump has largely enacted an agenda of tax cuts and spending increases that had grown the deficit markedly. Tax revenue for October 2018 through January 2019 fell $19\u00a0billion, or 2\u00a0percent, Treasury said. It noted a major reduction in corporate tax payments over the first four months of the fiscal year, falling close to 25\u00a0percent, or $17\u00a0billion. As part of the 2017 tax cut law, the tax rate paid by corporations was lowered from 35\u00a0percent to 21\u00a0percent. Spending, meanwhile, increased 9\u00a0percent over the same period. The biggest increases were for defense military programs, which saw a 12\u00a0percent increase, and Medicare, which saw a 16\u00a0percent increase. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that the deficit this year will reach close to $900\u00a0billion, because the government spends so much more money than it brings in through revenue. The White House next week is expected to propose a new budget plan for the fiscal year that begins in October, and Democrats are working on spending plans of their own. So far, there has been little effort to reconcile differences between both parties, and neither has shown much interest in addressing the widening budget deficit. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Tuesday acknowledged that national debt as a share of GDP has \u201cinched up a bit,\u201d but added in an interview on Fox News: \u201cWe are making an investment in America\u2019s future \u2026 and if that means we incur some additional debt in the short run, so be it.\u201d Kudlow said \u201cGrowth solves the problem,\u201d and predicted that the deficit-to-GDP ratio will come down with growth. \u201cThat will solve all of these problems and people will be very prosperous.\u201d The White House plan will propose cutting a number of domestic programs by at least 5\u00a0percent, including things like environmental protection, education and foreign aid, according to Trump administration officials who have previewed some of the plans. It will also propose adhering to caps on military and nonmilitary programs put in place several years ago, but it will simultaneously propose boosting defense spending in an uncapped program as a way to divert more money to the military. Fiscal conservatives have criticized this type of maneuver in past years, but White House acting budget director Russ Vought wrote in an editorial last week that it was the best option for diverting more money to the military. The ballooning deficit comes as interest rates are expected to begin rising, driving up the cost of borrowing money. The government is projected to spend $383\u00a0billion on interest payments for its debt this year, and that will rise to $581\u00a0billion in 2022, according to the CBO. There has been a total breakdown in Washington, however, over how to address the budget deficit. The White House has walled off popular programs Medicare and Social Security from any proposed cuts, with Trump saying it would be too politically unpopular to pursue changes to programs used by tens of millions of Americans. Democrats are also split over how to proceed. The ranks of fiscal hawks have dwindled, and a newer, vocal wing of the party has called for more deficit spending to finance social programs. Some in that wing argue the debt is less pressing than other social maladies, such as poverty or inadequate health coverage, while others argue the debt is of little consequence at all. Instead of trying to resolve their differences, the White House and some Democrats are seeking to make the 2020 elections a referendum on economic policy, suggesting neither side is looking to reach a compromise in the coming months. But the White House and Congress must reach an agreement on a new spending package by Sept.\u00a030, 2019, or they could face another government shutdown. Policymakers must also reach an agreement by this fall on raising or suspending the debt ceiling, as the government will no longer be able to borrow money to cover many payments if Congress doesn\u2019t act. Lawmakers have not begun debating how to deal with the debt ceiling at all, even though the last temporary suspension ended March\u00a01. The Treasury Department is now suspending certain payments and enacting delay tactics to allow it to continue funding operations to buy policymakers more time. During the tax cut debate in 2017, the White House promised that slashing tax rates would end up creating more revenue because it would allow the economy to grow at a faster clip. Economic growth did pick up in 2018, but Democrats have said the growth will be short-lived. So far, the growth has not come close to the levels needed to offset the $1.5\u00a0trillion in tax reductions that were part of the legislation. The federal government is now more than $22\u00a0trillion in debt, largely representing an accumulation of all the money it has borrowed to finance programs in past years. A deficit is the one-year gap between spending and revenue, and the debt is the total amount of money owed by the government. The U.S. economy is still the strongest in the world, and investors have retained a healthy appetite for U.S. government debt because the country has never defaulted on its obligations. But large debt levels have caused financial crises in a number of other countries and forced major economic changes that have led to recessions, a phenomenon that some have warned could happen in the United States if steps aren\u2019t taken. Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) was bemoaning debt levels Tuesday, a few hours before Treasury reported the big increase in the deficit. \u201cIf you take 22\u00a0trillion miles, total distance, you would fly from Earth to Pluto and back 3,081 times,\u201d Lankford said on the Senate floor. \u201cThis is a heavy debt.\u201d","130":"THE PROGNOSIS President Trump speaks\u00a0in the Roosevelt Room of the White House about lowering drug prices. (Susan Walsh\/AP) Capitol Hill Republicans\u00a0appear open to a surprisingly aggressive proposal from the Trump administration to lower Medicare payments by linking them to drug prices in other countries, even as some groups typically aligned with Republicans\u00a0blast the idea as government price-fixing. It wasn\u2019t at all clear how Republicans would respond to an idea to reduce drug prices laid out by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar in the fall, when he and President Trump suggested basing certain Medicare payments on an index of prices paid in other developed countries. While the idea \u2014 which HHS has yet to formally propose \u2014 doesn\u2019t go nearly far as the direct Medicare price negotiations Democrats want, it still smacks of more government involvement in determining what drugmakers can charge for their medications. That\u2019s an idea Republicans typically resist. Yet some leading GOP members, even if privately skeptical, are holding their fire\u00a0or even expressing cautious support. \u201cI do like it,\u201d Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told reporters yesterday. \u201cIf we compare our prices to a market basket of other rich nations \u2014 not Zimbabwe, but Germany \u2014 then you get a sense of reasonableness as to what the American taxpayer is paying.\u201d That sentiment from Cassidy, a conservative who has long characterized the Affordable Care Act as allowing government overreach, shows\u00a0the public pressure lawmakers are feeling to do something to lower prescription drug prices in the United States, which are unquestionably many times higher than in other countries. \u00a0 Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.)\u00a0speaks to reporters in\u00a0September\u00a02017 about his bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0(Andrew Harnik\/AP) The proposal for an international index doesn\u2019t go nearly as far as allowing the United States government to directly negotiate lower prices for Medicare\u2019s sweeping prescription drug program, an idea Trump pushed during his campaign but then backed away from. But other countries do set much lower prices for medicines,\u00a0and linking Medicare prices to their rates would, in a sense, allow the United States\u00a0to hitch a ride on the price-fixing wagon. A majority of voters appears to favor the idea of tying Medicare payments to lower prices in other countries. In a Kaiser Family Foundation poll released Friday, 74 percent of Democrats and 54 percent of Republicans expressed support for the idea. Azar\u2019s index idea tests Republicans on how far they\u2019re willing to go in enabling the federal government to determine prices for drugs paid through Medicare \u2014 a massive program that tends to set the tone for the nation\u2019s private plans. Republicans were muted in their response when Azar first laid out the idea of an index. Five months later, some are still cagey on how they feel about it. One key senator to watch is Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who heads the powerful Senate Finance Committee. So far, Grassley has said only that he\u2019s withholding judgment until after HHS actually proposes a rule. Senate Finance Committee Chairman\u00a0Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). (Jacquelyn Martin\/AP) \u201cI will answer the question the same way I\u2019ve tried to answer it for two months now,\u201d Grassley\u00a0recently\u00a0told reporters. \u201cThis proposal is out there for discussion. I\u2019m going to wait until the final product goes out under the administrative procedures act and comment at that point.\u201d Grassley even suggested Azar presented the idea as a way of getting the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s attention \u2014 but may not follow through with an actual proposal. \u201cThis is just my gut feeling \u2014 it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve heard from Azar \u2014 I think Azar\u2019s approach is to get people to the negotiating table,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cI would suggest to you there might be something that would negate the necessity for going ahead with new regulations.\u201d The index would apply only to drugs dispensed directly by doctors to Medicare patients \u2014 and HHS would need help from lawmakers to make it permanent. Without legislation passed by Congress, the agency could only implement the index as a five-year experiment and it would apply\u00a0to just half of Medicare\u2019s \u201cPart B\u201d doctors program. It\u2019s one of several ways the agency says it\u2019s trying to realign incentives all along the drug supply pipeline so that pharmaceutical makers lower list prices and pharmacies and insurers pass along more savings to patients. But it\u2019s also the idea that has raised the most ire among groups typically aligned with Republicans. U.S. Chamber of Commerce chief executive Tom Donohue has called the proposal \u201can assault on our free enterprise system.\u201d The Chamber is running cable, digital and print ads the first half of March urging the administration to abandon the idea, which it\u00a0characterizes as \u201cforeign price controls.\u201d Earlier this week, the FreedomWorks Foundation issued a report pushing back on the idea and charging the administration would be exceeding its legal authority. A pricing index \u201cassumes that governments have the ability to efficiently set prices for any good or service,\u201d Patrick Hedger, FreedomWorks policy director, said in a statement. \u201cGovernment price controls always result in inefficiencies because prices do nothing more than transmit information.\u201d Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), shown at a campaign event in Las Vegas on Sunday, is introducing legislation that would legalize marijuana and expunge the criminal records of people arrested for using the drug. (Ethan Miller\/Getty Images) AHH: Marijuana is getting some pot-sitive signals form 2020 presidential candidates. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is reintroducing his Marijuana Justice Act to legalize marijuana on the federal level and expunge convictions for marijuana possession. Four of his fellow Democratic presidential contenders will co-sponsor it. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.),\u00a0Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Kamala D. Harris (D-Ca.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also co-sponsored the bill when Booker first introduced it in 2017, but the measure was never brought up for a vote, our Post colleague David Weigel reports. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who is considering his own presidential run, and Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.), who could join the pack too, are also co-sponsors. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to simply decriminalize marijuana,\u201d Booker said in a statement announcing the new version of his bill. \u201cWe must expunge the records of those who have served their time. The end we seek is not just legalization, it\u2019s justice.\u201d \u201cAny of them would be the first nominee of a major political party to endorse the legalization of marijuana; Sanders, as a candidate in 2016, had called for the drug to be decriminalized,\u201d David writes. OOF: Amid an anti-vaccine movement and measles outbreak nationwide, an Arizona state lawmaker took to Facebook to criticize the state for\u00a0pushing vaccinations.\u00a0Republican State Rep. Kelly Townsend, a five-term state lawmaker who our Post colleague Timothy Bella writes is \u201cno stranger to making controversial and befuddling statements on social media,\u201d wrote this: \u201cDearest friends and people of Arizona, it seems we are prepared to give up our liberty, the very sovereignty of our body, because of measles,\u201d Townsend wrote. \u201cI read yesterday that the idea is being floated that if not enough people get vaccinated, then we are going to force them to. The idea that we force someone to give up their liberty for the sake of the collective is not based on American values but rather, Communist.\u201d A\u00a0state House committee recently advanced three bills that could make it easier to get exemptions from vaccination requirements. But Arizona Gov. Dough Ducey (R) has threatened to veto legislation that would mean fewer vaccinations. \"I'm pro vaccination. I'm anti-measles,\" Ducey told reporters this week, the AP reports. \"I'm not going to sign any law that doesn't' promote or extend vaccinations in the state of Arizona\u2026We want to see more of our kids being vaccinated rather than fewer.\" In an interview with The Post, Townsend acknowledged the studies supporting vaccines but defended her right to opt out of them. \u201cMy child is at risk from being injured from a vaccine and your child is potentially at risk if my son catches something,\" she told The Post. \"Whose child is more important?

The Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019, which passed on a 228 to 198 vote, looks to close what\u2019s known as the \u201cCharleston loophole,\u201d referring to the gunman behind the 2015 massacre\u00a0of nine black parishioners at a South Carolina church who was able to buy a gun after a three-day background check didn\u2019t turn up a prior conviction. Before the vote, House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), who led the effort behind the bill, delivered an impassioned floor speech referencing the shooting, our Post colleague Felicia Sonmez reports. \u201cThe members of this august body need to think a little bit about the value of those lives. Are they more valuable than the inconvenience a gun purchaser may have by having to wait 10 rather than three days to make a purchase?\u201d he said. The American Academy of Pediatrics praised the passage of the bill, calling gun violence a \u201cpublic health epidemic and must be addressed that way.\u201d \"On the heels of yesterday's passage of the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 \u2026 we are one step closer to making our communities safer for children and their families,\u201d Kyle Yasuda, AAP president, said in a statement. \u201cPediatricians applaud lawmakers for their bipartisan action, and now urge the U.S. Senate to follow suit without delay.\u201d But Trump has threatened to veto both bills, which have a low chance of advancing through the Republican-controlled Senate.

Congress can and should pursue such legislation,\u201d wrote the group of 16 organizations, including the Center for American Progress, Social Security Works, Families USA and the AFL-CIO. \u201cAlthough Medicare negotiation is a much-needed reform, it is not the only solution needed to reach most Americans. We need reforms that lower stratospheric launch prices for new drugs and prevent price gouging on existing drugs for all payers.\u201d The letter notes that private insurance covers 56 percent of the nation\u2019s population, calling for legislation to \u201clower prescription drug prices for seniors, middle-class families, and lower-income families, regardless of whether they are covered by Medicare, private insurance, or Medicaid.\u201d The Anthem\u00a0website is displayed. (Andrew Harrer\/Bloomberg News) \u2014 The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association issued a list of policy proposals intended to expand health-care coverage and reduce individual marketplace premiums. The group suggests its proposals could expand coverage to more than 4 million additional people and shrink premiums by a third.  BCBSA, whose insurers have been some of the most successful in Affordable Care Act marketplaces, suggests enhancing tax credits to make coverage cheaper by making sure no one pays more than 12 percent of their income on insurance, creating a federal funding system to support people with serious medical needs and expanding\u00a0outreach efforts. \u201cWe believe everyone should have access to coverage and care, no matter who you are or where you live,\u201d said Scott Serota, president and chief executive of the organization that represents the 36 locally owned and independently operated Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies. \u201cThe individual market is a critical source of coverage for people from all walks of life, and it should be strengthened to make coverage more affordable while protecting those with pre-existing conditions.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration campus in Silver Spring, Md.\u00a0(Andrew Harnik\/AP) \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning to Canadian drug company CanaRx about sending \u201cunapproved\u201d and \u201cmisbranded\u201d medications to the United States and warned U.S. consumers not to use drugs from the company.  \u201cThe FDA action comes amid a growing clamor over high drug prices in the United States\u00a0that includes a Senate hearing Tuesday at which top pharmaceutical executives were grilled about the costs,\u201d our Post colleagues Lenny Bernstein and Laurie McGinley report. Importing cheaper prescription drugs from Canada and other major countries has been floated as one way to bring down costs for American consumers, and our colleagues report that \u201cCongress has repeatedly approved legislation allowing drug importation over the last 20 years that has never been implemented.\u201d In an interview with The Post, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb insisted the move wasn\u2019t \u201ctimed with anything. This isn\u2019t politically motivated. This is our bread and butter. This is public health protection 101.\u201d But Lenny and Laurie write that Chicago-based attorney for CanaRx Joseph Morris expressed confusion about the move. \u201cWe have not had any prior warnings, threats, complaints or communications with the FDA at all,\u201d Morris said. \u201cThey seem to think we\u2019re an Internet pharmacy contracting with plan sponsors to supply medications.\u201d But he said the company only sells drugs \u2014 in their original packaging \u2014 made by brand-name companies such as Pfizer and Merck that are licensed by the FDA.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced Monday that she will not participate in a high-dollar fundraising program during her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, staking out a position that differentiates her from most other contenders in the field. \u201cCandidates spend too much time with wealthy donors, and I\u2019ve made a decision to change that,\u201d Warren wrote as the subject line in an email that went out to her supporters Monday morning explaining the decision. \u201cThat means no fancy receptions or big money fundraisers only with people who can write the big checks,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cIt means that wealthy donors won\u2019t be able to purchase better seats or one-on-one time with me at our events.\u201d If you are inclined to be cynical, you might surmise she is doing poorly with fundraising. Abandoning modest fundraising activities makes her shortcoming into a virtue, an attempt to level the playing field. There are several points worth underscoring. First, we are not talking about really big donors. The people Warren declines to cater to (literally, if one includes the canap\u00e9s served at soirees) are not millionaire-donors. She has already written off that sort of money by swearing off PAC money. These are the people who are limited to $2,800 per individual. That\u2019s nothing to sneeze at, but by the same token are we to believe a candidate can be bought or even influenced by $2,800? The problem, we thought, with the Citizens United ruling was PAC money from unknown sources; now we\u2019re to believe the problem extends to a professional able to donate $2,800. Second, since $2,800 donors don\u2019t seem worthy of suspicion, most if not all of the other candidates could well decide they\u2019ll be very happy, thank you, to continue catering to such donors. They very well may decide that donor events for hard money, limited and fully disclosed, are unobjectionable. Why should they turn up their noses at the additional dollars, not to mention the enthusiasm and commitment to their campaigns, that donor events can generate? If others decline to copy her, Warren will wind up poorer and only reinforce the impression, created in part by the DNA fiasco, that she\u2019s not the candidate with the best political skills to go up against the real target, President Trump. Third, Sanders (and maybe others) are raking it in thanks to small donations. That\u2019s the real issue: Why aren\u2019t these small donors coming to her instead of Sanders, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), etc.? If one looks at the early polling (which is not predictive, but reflective of this moment in time) and the money, one has to wonder if Warren hasn\u2019t yet found how to connect with voters, regardless of the level of giving. Rather than rely on a stunt, perhaps she needs to think more deeply whether she is really connecting with critical early state voters. Fourth, we have in the past made the case that money is overrated. If I\u2019m right and less money (or less wealthy donors) doesn\u2019t give candidates any advantage, it sort of defeats the crusade against Citizens United and PACs more generally. Why not let rich people and corporations waste their money? You only \u201cbuy\u201d candidates if your money is critical to their success. If it becomes apparent that their money is superfluous, the impression of great influence will fade. Finally, if you are concerned about polarization and extremism in politics, don\u2019t think that you\u2019ll improve matters by calling out larger donors. Sure, there are highly partisan donors (e.g. Tom Steyer on the left, Charles Koch on the right), but at least in this election cycle, the pressure (if any) from $2,800 donors and even from million-dollar PAC donors is in favor of electability. It\u2019s the $50-per-month super-engaged activists who may be pushing candidates to the left. It\u2019s the constant effort to keep those voters\/donors enraged and hyperventilating that may be the greatest threat to reasoned, moderate debate. Reliance on super-motivated small donors, one Democratic campaign veteran tells me, \u201cis sort of like the donor caucuses. Yes, you get something valuable (money\/delegates). But the process rewards moving left in dangerous ways.\u201d The veteran adds, \u201cThat\u2019s actually a huge and underreported dynamic of this campaign: The consultants are pushing them to take far lefty positions to generate clicks and online dollars.\u201d In short, it\u2019s unclear whether Warren\u2019s gambit will work \u2014 and if it does, if it perversely winds up proving that campaign finance reform is overrated. Rather, her new strategy might indicate a more fundamental problem with her campaign. In any event, don\u2019t imagine that the $2,800 donors are a problem of our political system; the radicalization and polarization of ordinary voters remain the biggest impediments to sensible, rational politics. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy remedy for that. (Maybe we should revive civic education and media literacy, or break the social media algorithms that promote confirmation bias.) Nixing cocktail parties and rubber-chicken dinners for upper-middle-class donors might ironically make things worse.

To save money, the nonprofit clinic, which relies on its patients\u2019 food-stamp money for funding, will ask patients to sit in diapers in which they have repeatedly urinated, sometimes for hours. The Casa Ismael clinic is short on funds in part because of cuts in food stamps that hit about 1.3\u00a0million residents of Puerto Rico this month \u2014 a new crisis for an island still struggling from the effects of Hurricane Maria in September 2017. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have the money right now,\u201d Izquierdo, 56, said in an interview in the clinic\u2019s sparse first-floor office, where a chunk of ceiling tiles remains missing since the hurricane. Izquierdo pulled out a chart with each patient\u2019s name, annotated with the cost of his adult diapers for the month. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard. It is so unfair. That cut is going to kill us.\u201d The federal government provided additional food-stamp aid to Puerto Rico after the hurricane, but Congress missed the deadline for reauthorization in March as it focused on other issues before leaving for a week-long recess. Federal lawmakers have also been stalled by the Trump administration, which has derided the extra aid as unnecessary. Now, about 43\u00a0percent of Puerto Rico\u2019s residents are grappling with a sudden cut to a benefit they rely on for groceries and other essentials. And while Congress may address this issue soon, the lapse underscores the broader vulnerability of Puerto Rico\u2019s economy, as well as key parts of its safety net, to the whims of an increasingly hostile federal government with which it has feuded over key priorities. Puerto Rico will again need the federal government\u2019s help to stave off drastic cuts to Medicaid, the health-care program for the poor and disabled, as well as for the disbursement of billions in hurricane relief aid that has not yet been turned over to the island. The island would not need Congress to step in to fund its food-stamp and Medicaid programs if it were a state. For states, the federal government has committed to funding those programs\u2019 needs, whatever the cost and without needing to take a vote. But Puerto Rico instead funds its programs through a block grant from the federal government, which needs to be regularly renewed, and also gives food-stamp benefits about 40\u00a0percent smaller than those of states. After initially vowing to reject the food-stamp funding, President Trump has agreed to the emergency request to help Senate Republicans pass a broader disaster-relief package, which may be taken up for a vote this week. But at an Oval Office meeting on Feb.\u00a022, Trump asked top advisers for ways to limit federal support from going to Puerto Rico, believing it is taking money that should be going to the mainland, according to senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details of the president\u2019s private remarks. The meeting \u2014 an afternoon session focused on Department of Housing and Urban Development grants \u2014 ended abruptly, and Trump has continued to ask aides how much money the island will get. Then, Trump said he wanted the money only to fortify the electric grid there. Trump has also privately signaled he will not approve any additional help for Puerto Rico beyond the food-stamp money, setting up a congressional showdown with Democrats who have pushed for more expansive help for the island. A senior administration official with direct knowledge of the meeting described Trump\u2019s stance: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want another single dollar going to the island.\u201d Puerto Rico\u2019s government first started cutting benefits for food-stamp beneficiaries by an average of 25\u00a0percent during the first week of March. By March 12, more than 670,000 people had received reduced monthly food-stamp payments. The cuts were in effect for the entire program by Friday. Congressional lawmakers knew of the deadlines for months. In January, House Democrats approved $600\u00a0million in additional food-stamp funding to finance the program until the fall, but the bill immediately stalled in the Senate, with the Trump administration releasing a letter calling the additional food-stamp aid \u201cexcessive and unnecessary.\u201d Multiple Senate Republicans, led by Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), have incorporated the $600\u00a0million for Puerto Rico in legislation aimed at helping farmers in states such as Georgia who have been hurt by other storms, in a bid for broader support for their bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was rumored to be considering a vote in the middle of March on that package, which if passed could have spared about half the program beneficiaries on the island from cuts. Instead, Congress spent the week consumed in a debate over a vote to disapprove of Trump\u2019s emergency declaration for a border wall. It adjourned for an additional week without resolving the emergency relief package. Congressional negotiators also remained divided on the exact contours of the funding bill, with Perdue\u2019s bill costing $13.5\u00a0billion and Senate Democrats seeking more than $14 billion, including some additional measures to help Puerto Rico that Senate Republicans do not expect Trump would support. Negotiations were continuing as of late Friday, but lawmakers are expected to vote to begin debate on the emergency aid package this week, according to congressional aides. The impasse comes amid a hardening opposition by the president against extending additional aid to Puerto Rico. Trump sees the island as fundamentally broken and has told advisers that no amount of money will ever fix its systemic problems. He describes in meetings that large swaths of the island never had power to begin with and that it is \u201cridiculous\u201d how much money is going to Puerto Rico in food-stamp aid, according to the senior official. He has occasionally groused about how ungrateful political officials in Puerto Rico were for the administration\u2019s help, the official said. Trump also read a Wall Street Journal report from October and became convinced that bondholders and others were profiting off federal government aid \u2014 and grew furious. (The report describes prices on Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds increasing after its governing fiscal board projected that disaster funding would boost the island\u2019s overall economic health.) Since then, aides have described a president who regularly brings up the island to make sure it is not getting too much money. Current and former officials say Trump often complains in meetings that Puerto Rico does not even know how to spend the money the island has been allocated. Additionally, Trump administration officials who defended the island \u2014 Tom Bossert, the former homeland security adviser, and Pam Patenaude, the former deputy HUD secretary \u2014 are no longer in the administration. Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, has also been critical of how the island has spent its money. The emergency food-stamp aid approved by Congress after Maria gave the Puerto Rican economy an immediate cash infusion, while also shielding the hurricane\u2019s victims from the rising cost of basic food staples and safe water. The Agranel supermarket group, for instance, has hired at least two employees \u2014 and often as many as seven \u2014 in each of its 37 stores since the hurricane, often in neighborhoods with very high rates of poverty and unemployment. \u201cIt helps not only these poor communities but injects the economy with money to start running. It helps the trucker who moves the food, the janitor who cleans the store, the guy who fixes the refrigerator where the food is stored,\u201d said Felix G. Aponte Lopez, a food supplier for Agranel. \u201cIt\u2019s had a very positive domino effect.\u201d But now that the additional food-stamp money has run out, Puerto Ricans see a familiar story in the unreliability of federal aid over which they have no control. \u201cThe problems of Puerto Rico have a root-cause problem attached to it: We don\u2019t have political power and are not treated as equal citizens,\u201d said Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, noting the island does not elect voting members of Congress (though it does elect a non-sitting member) or have a general-election vote in U.S. presidential races. \u201cMaria has crystallized and enhanced this sense of powerlessness.\u201d For Amadita Jimenez Gutierrez, 63, the food-stamp infusion meant a near doubling of her income, to about $200 a month. Although she has not been paying rent and fears eviction, the higher food-stamp benefit allowed her to cook more-healthful meals. But this month, Gutierrez\u2019s food-stamp benefit fell to about $115, while a small cash supplement under the program was also cut from about $40 to around $20. As she walks through an aisle full of cooking supplies, Gutierrez said, she will skip purchases of rice and beans this month, as well as detergent and cleaning supplies. \u201cWe will buy less and eat less,\u201d she said. Some Puerto Rico residents on food stamps will see a cash supplement that comes as part of the food-stamp cut to levels lower than before the hurricane, in part because the island\u2019s government expanded the program\u2019s eligibility after Congress appropriated the emergency aid without providing permanent funding. The cuts also come as Puerto Ricans continue to struggle with the fallout from the hurricane: Hundreds of thousands of people have moved to states, while others continue to spend their money on repairs and other damage caused by Maria. Luz Rivera Morales works full time as a nurse at Auxilio Mutuo, one of the best hospitals in Puerto Rico. She has two daughters, 8 and 5, the younger of whom requires expensive asthma medication. This month\u2019s food-stamp cut reduced Rivera Morales\u2019s benefit from $420 a month to $218. She plans on having to stop or restrict purchases for yogurt, meat and vegetables for her and her children. \u201cEverything goes up. Nothing goes down,\u201d Rivera Morales, 33, said in an interview from a San Juan office of the Families Department, which administers the food-stamp program. \u201cYes, I\u2019m very worried.\u201d Across the room from Rivera Morales sat Rafael Veles, 82, who had already been waiting for two hours to learn how severe his benefit cut will be. His wife of 56 years has Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Veles \u2014 her caretaker \u2014 fears the cut will put the adult diapers he buys, at $16 for each package, outside their budget. \u201cIt\u2019s too little for our expenses,\u201d Veles said. \u201cI have to change her diapers often, and the money is not enough to pay for the Pampers. Sometimes, I have to change her five times a day. It\u2019s not enough.\u201d Cecilia Estrada, 88, saw her benefit cut to around $100 a month from around $200. Estrada said she will buy the cheapest things possible. She is particularly worried about the cost of milk, at close to $5 a jug. \u201cI am buying only a few things, trying to make sure I don\u2019t spend more than I have,\u201d Estrada said while shuffling slowly through a Loiza supermarket in San Juan. Of the Puerto Ricans on the food-stamp program in February 2018, about 55\u00a0percent are children, elderly or disabled, according to the preliminary findings of a forthcoming research paper by Hector Cordero-Guzman, a professor at Baruch College, part of the City University of New York. Of the remaining 45\u00a0percent, about 42\u00a0percent were looking for work; 15 percent were working; and 17 percent were in school or had a family-related reason for not being able to work, according to Cordero-Guzman\u2019s research. In 2018, more than 200,000 Puerto Rico residents with disabilities relied on food stamps every month, according to Cordero-Guzman\u2019s research. Among them were the 11 men of the Casa Ismael HIV clinic in Toa Baja. Izquierdo\u2019s parents founded Casa Ismael after their son \u2014 Izquierdo\u2019s brother \u2014 died of HIV in Puerto Rico. Izquierdo, a professional accountant, decided to help her mother after the death of her father in 2016. Izquierdo tries to break up the monotony of life in the home with special meals on Fridays, including the occasional lasagna or a homemade pizza. She will sometimes use the food-stamp money to buy a birthday cake. On special occasions, she tries holding picnics outside, at least for the men who can take their wheelchairs down a rickety red ramp to the small backyard, which is still littered with debris from the hurricane. But the food-stamp cut reduced her budget by more than $1,000 every month. Earlier this month, Izquierdo went to Walgreens and charged three packs of Pampers to her credit card because they had run out completely. Izquierdo said she will continue to cook lasagna and throw birthday parties regardless of the food-stamp cuts. She has no idea how she will pay for them. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to have to find a way,\u201d she said.","133":"Brian Hooks, chairman of the Koch network, and Charles Koch, its main patron, speak to donors Saturday night during the Koch network seminar in Indian Wells, Calif. (Seminar Network) With Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \u2014 The donor network led by billionaire industrialist Charles Koch will launch a new organization next month to focus on changing K-12 education as we know it. The effort will begin as a pilot project focused on five states with a combined school-age population of 16 million kids, but officials said Monday that they aren\u2019t ready to identify them yet because they\u2019re still finalizing partnerships with some of the country\u2019s leading educational organizations. The still-unnamed entity purportedly plans to focus on three buckets: changing public policy to address \u201cthe root causes\u201d of failing schools, developing new technologies to promote individualized learning, and investing in teachers and classrooms. The announcement came Monday at the end of a three-day seminar where 634 donors who have each committed to contribute at least $100,000 annually to Koch-linked groups gathered under palm trees at a luxury resort in the Coachella Valley. The Koch team is modeling its amped-up education efforts on its successful overhaul of the criminal justice system, which began in friendly states before moving to the federal level. In that case, Koch World sought out unlikely allies and played the long game for years before any big legislation passed. In the past, most conversations about education at these twice-annual Koch confabs have quickly turned into bashing teachers unions. So it was notable when Brian Hooks, the chairman of the Koch network, went out of his way to praise teachers and acknowledge that many have been picketing recently. \u201cFor too long, this issue has been framed unnecessarily as us vs. them, public vs. private, teacher vs. student, parent vs. administrator,\u201d Hooks told a ballroom of donors. \u201cThe teachers who have expressed frustration in the past several months are good people. I mean, they\u2019re teachers. We all remember the positive impact that a teacher or several teachers have had on our lives. They\u2019re expressing legitimate concerns. But the current approach means that nobody wins, so they need better options.\u201d Hooks recognizes that many will question their motives, but he said the goal is to \u201creally shake things up\u201d by \u201ccoming alongside concerned teachers\u201d to \u201cfind a better way.\u201d Teachers union leaders, who are closely aligned with the Democratic Party, have accused the Koch groups of trying to undermine traditional public schools. Koch and his allies say the system is broken and requires wholesale changes. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has been a longtime ally of the network. \u201cThis is a tough one, no doubt,\u201d Hooks said. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge that a whole lot of people look at and say is impossible. But we see a tremendous opportunity to unite people to help ensure that every kid has the opportunity to succeed.\u201d Philanthropist Stacy Hock of Austin, a major Koch donor who has been funding education efforts at the state level in Texas for years, says that traditional forms of classroom instruction encourage \u201csoul-crushing\u201d conformity, and she has emerged as an outspoken advocate of \u201cpersonalized learning.\u201d \u201cFamilies are getting more and more comfortable with experimenting and taking risks,\u201d she said on the sidelines of the meeting. \u201cEducation should be getting way, way better and way, way cheaper, but the opposite is happening.\u201d Hock said the new Koch initiative, as it ramps up, will identify what\u2019s working at the local level and push for those things to be replicated elsewhere. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing all across the country are little flames,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t yet know is how to throw gasoline on all those flames.\u201d Thousands of teachers march in the rain through Los Angeles earlier this month while striking for smaller class sizes, better school funding formulas and higher teacher pay. (Frederic J. Brown\/AFP\/Getty Images) -- The network\u2019s pivot toward education is partly because a personal interest in the subject by Chase Koch, Charles\u2019s 41-year-old son. He is an executive in the family business who has been taking on a more prominent role inside the network his dad began convening in 2003. Chase\u2019s wife, Annie, a neonatal nurse by training, opened a private school in September called Wonder on the campus of Wichita State University. It\u2019s initially for elementary-age children, and the plan is to phase in middle and high school programs. There\u2019s lots of experimentation going on, with the goal of letting children pursue what interests them the most and not follow a strict curriculum. -- Previewing their K-12 push, Koch strategists pointed to research being conducted with their financial support by Ashley Berner at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Institute for Education Policy. Her main interest is expanding what she calls \u201ceducational pluralism,\u201d which is when the government funds all types of schools, including explicitly religious ones, but does not necessarily run them. \u201cBerner points to examples such as the Netherlands, which funds 36 different types of schools, from Islamic to Jewish Orthodox to socialist,\u201d the Charles Koch Foundation notes in a summary of her work. \u201cAlberta, Canada, funds homeschooling along with Inuit, Jewish, and secular schools. In Australia, the central government is the nation\u2019s top funder of independent schools. Other countries with plural school systems include Denmark, Finland, Germany, and Sweden.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the democratic norm around the world. In pluralism, choice and accountability are two sides of the same coin,\u201d said Berner, who wrote a book in 2017 called \u201cPluralism and American Public Education: No One Way to School.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start supporting politicians who are willing to make compromises. Americans are tired of the battles between charters and district schools; these take up too much energy and resources. A pluralistic system doesn\u2019t pit entire sectors against one another.\u201d -- Koch will continue to make heavy investments in higher education as well. The Charles Koch Foundation already provides financial support to more than 350 colleges and universities, which has generated controversy and pushback on many campuses. John Hardin, the director of university relations for the Koch Foundation, said the network\u2019s investments in education \u201claid the intellectual foundation\u201d to achieve the public policy changes the donors wanted on criminal justice. For example, the donors helped finance an Academy for Justice conference that convened 120 scholars on criminal justice to talk about their research. \u201cThis is how you get it done and change the paradigm,\u201d Hardin told donors during a presentation. \u201cThe Academy for Justice is changing the debate.\u201d\u00a0 A booklet provided to donors, which outlined some of the network\u2019s major investments, highlighted support for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, which produces research that is routinely cited by allies in government. \u201cMercatus scholars are re-shaping the field of regulatory economics and changing the debate over rightsizing the administrative state,\u201d the handbook noted. -- The Koch network is also setting its sights on publishers of pricey textbooks. The foundation, which is part of the network, is supporting OpenStax at Rice University, which produces books that are available for free online to students. Charles Koch put up the money for a series of textbooks about business, including ethics, entrepreneurship, principles of management and organizational behavior. David Harris, the editor in chief of the project, said in an interview that Koch gave his team full editorial independence, that the books are all peer-reviewed and that OpenStax receives financial support from liberal foundations, too, including the one funded by George Soros. About 30 free open-source texts are now available, and more are in the pipeline. -- The goal of all this investment is to change \u201cthe trajectory of the country.\u201d Kevin Gentry, a top Koch lieutenant who works for Koch Industries, told donors yesterday that they can have perhaps the greatest impact by focusing on civil society initiatives like these. \u201cThose of you have been coming to these meetings for a long time know we\u2019ve gone through a lot of ups and downs,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of times we would say, \u2018Okay, this was good, but were we really \u2026 changing the trajectory of the country?\u2019 \u2026 We feel like a couple of years ago we began to turn the corner, but now is the opportunity to scale.\u201d -- One reason the wealthy donors are so amenable to investing so much in education is alarm about the next generation. Recent polling shows younger people have a more favorable impression of socialism than capitalism. \u201cThe younger generation is less sympathetic and less understanding of limited government conservatism,\u201d said Art Pope of North Carolina, a fixture of Koch meetings. \u201cThey\u2019re more sympathetic or more willing to give not just social justice but outright socialism a chance. \u2026 It used to be you didn\u2019t have to have a serious conversation about socialism in American politics. Now you do. So what is the appeal of that? How do you message?\u201d -- Many progressives are dubious and skeptical of the Koch rebranding effort, which I wrote about in yesterday\u2019s Daily 202. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) wrote in: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced by the Koch network\u2019s new charm offensive; nor should your readers be. Until we know how much the Kochs, and the 634 other mega-donors who joined them, are spending on dark-money campaigns to block action on climate change, undermine public unions, confirm obedient judges, and cut their own taxes by billions of dollars, we should view their latest PR effort as more obfuscation. \u2026 If Charles Koch\u2019s top goal is \u2018uniting with people across the whole spectrum,\u2019 he should unite them around honest facts and science, not deceitful campaigns funded by dark money.\u201d -- While they may still share many of the same goals, especially when it comes to judges and regulations, there is mounting tension between the Koch network and the official GOP apparatus. My colleague Michelle Ye Hee Lee, who covers money in politics and has also been here for the donor meeting, scoops that the data firm aligned with the Republican National Committee does not plan to renew a data-sharing agreement with the Koch network for the 2020 cycle, after years of working in tandem to enrich voter files for GOP campaigns and state parties. Henry Barbour, the chairman of the RNC-backed firm Data Trust, said the split was prompted by the network\u2019s decision not to endorse President Trump for reelection in 2020 or to support Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) last fall. \u201cIn the past, [the Koch network\u2019s data operation] i360 was a consistent supporter of the Republican and conservative ecosystem, so we have worked with them to help win elections, but that has changed,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a path where we have an agreement with them in the 2020 election cycle.\u201d Casino mogul Steve Wynn speaks at a 2016 news conference in Medford, Mass. (Charles Krupa\/AP) GET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b New York Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s former chief of staff, who was forced to resign over sexual harassment allegations, was fired from his previous job for similar reasons. Kevin O\u2019Brien left his job as a senior adviser at the Democratic Governors Association after a woman accused him of sexual harassment and an investigation corroborated her claims. But a spokesman for de Blasio said the mayor did not know of the previous allegations against O\u2019Brien. (New York Times) Pacific Gas and Electric filed for bankruptcy protection as it faces billions of dollars in potential liabilities from the California wildfires. State authorities have determined that PG&E power lines were responsible for at least 18 wildfires that killed 22 people in October 2017, and the utility may still be declared liable for\u00a0November\u2019s devastating Camp Fire. (Wall Street Journal) Several prominent Democrats are forming a new group, the Democratic Majority for Israel, to support 2020 candidates with staunchly pro-Israel views. The group\u2019s formation comes as a number of high-profile\u00a0progressive lawmakers have voiced support for Palestinian rights. (New York Times) A polar vortex diving into the Midwest and Great Lakes will cause wind chills to drop to as low as minus-65. The National Weather Service in Chicago warned that the \u201clife-threatening extreme cold\u201d could cause \u201crapid onset of frostbite and hypothermia.\u201d The subfreezing temperatures are also expected to break numerous records across the region.

Apple said that it has identified a fix for the problem, which would be released as part of a software update later this week. (CNN) A woman in New York spent an entire weekend trapped in the elevator of her employers\u2019 townhouse. The home\u2019s owners spent the weekend away, so Marites Fortaliza was not discovered in the broken elevator until Monday morning. (New York Times) THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- The Justice Department charged the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei with fraud. Ellen Nakashima and Devlin Barrett report: \u201cA 13-count indictment filed in New York City against Huawei, two affiliates and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, details allegations of bank and wire fraud. The company also is charged with violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and conspiring to obstruct justice related to the investigation. Canadian officials arrested Meng on a U.S. warrant Dec. 1. She has since been released on bail, and her travel is confined to Vancouver and surrounding areas. Meng could face up to 30 years if found guilty on all counts. On Monday evening, the Canadian Justice Department confirmed it had received a formal request for Meng\u2019s extradition from the United States to stand trial. ... Beijing has pressured Canada to release Meng. \u2026 \u201cThe indictment threatened to further strain relations between Washington and Beijing as officials from both countries prepare for talks this week aimed at ending a months-long economic impasse that has contributed to huge swings in the stock market. Although [Trump] had suggested he was willing to help secure Meng\u2019s release if China met his demands for a trade deal, Justice and Commerce department officials insisted Meng\u2019s criminal case was a separate matter.\u201d -- The Trump administration announced sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s oil industry in an effort to force President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro out of power. Karen DeYoung, Steven Mufson and Anthony Faiola report: \u201cAny attempt to harm remaining U.S. diplomats in Venezuela, or violence against the newly recognized president, Juan Guaid\u00f3, \u2018will be met with a significant response,\u2019 White House national security adviser John Bolton said. He declined to define that response ... [Trump] \u2018has made it very clear \u2026\u00a0all options are on the table,\u2019 said Bolton, who announced the sanctions at a White House press briefing alongside Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. ... \u201cPentagon officials have indicated they have no orders to prepare for military action toward Venezuela. But by starving Maduro of a critical source of cash, the Trump administration has dramatically increased the pressure on his government. Maduro, responding in televised remarks to diplomats gathered in Caracas, said: \u2018Never before was there an open coup attempt led from Washington. Today John Bolton asked for a coup, a desperate blow. ... There\u2019s no limit to the extremist group that took over the White House. They\u2019re like the Ku Klux Klan.\u2019\u201d -- Writing\u00a0on Bolton\u2019s notepad\u00a0reading \u201c5,000 troops to Colombia\u201d during the briefing raised more questions about possible military intervention in Venezuela. From Eli Rosenberg and Dan Lamothe: Pentagon officials\u00a0\u201csaid that the Defense Department hadn\u2019t received any orders to this effect. Asked about the briefing pad, the White House pointed to statements made by [Trump] and Bolton in recent days that \u2018all options are on the table\u2019 regarding Venezuela. \u2026 If enacted, the troop movement would mark a major escalation of U.S. involvement in South America, though it is unclear what exactly the service members\u2019 roles would be.\u201d -- Advancing peace negotiations between U.S. and Taliban officials has\u00a0the potential to soon bring an end to America\u2019s longest war. Pamela Constable, Missy Ryan and Paul Sonne report: \u201cAfghan President Ashraf Ghani, speaking from his palace in Kabul, addressed what appeared to be a significant breakthrough in talks between American officials and Taliban representatives in Doha, Qatar, calling on insurgents to begin \u2018serious talks\u2019 with his government and embrace a \u2018speedy peace.\u2019 \u2026 But both U.S. and Afghan officials said several major issues remain to be resolved before a peace agreement can be reached, including U.S. demands for an extended cease-fire and the Afghan government\u2019s insistence on being included in talks about the Taliban\u2019s future role in government and society.\u201d THERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Acting attorney general Matt Whitaker said special counsel Bob Mueller\u2019s investigation is \u201cclose to being completed.\u201d Devlin Barrett reports: \u201cWhitaker made the comment during a news conference to announce indictments against [Huawei]. Asked about his view of the Mueller probe in light of critical comments he made while working as a television pundit in 2017, Whitaker said those statements were offered while he was a private citizen. \u2018I have been fully briefed on the investigation and I look forward to Director Mueller delivering the final report,\u2019 Whitaker said. \u2018I am comfortable that the decisions that were made are going to be reviewed. \u2026\u00a0Right now, you know, the investigation is, I think, close to being completed.\u2019 Whitaker\u2019s remarks, though brief, represent the most extensive comments on the subject by any senior law enforcement official in recent months. \u2026 Law enforcement officials, however, have said Mueller envisions eventually handing off prosecutorial work from his investigation to U.S. attorneys.\u201d -- But, but, but: An attorney for a former employee of Roger Stone said Mueller still wants his client\u2019s testimony, indicating the special counsel may be planning another indictment of Stone or others. CNN\u2019s Sara Murray and Katelyn Polantz report: Defense attorney Paul\u00a0Kamenar's client is Andrew\u00a0Miller, \u201ca former employee of Stone's whom Mueller subpoenaed in mid-2018 to testify to the grand jury. In a court hearing about Miller's testimony, a judge made clear that Mueller sought information Miller had about Stone's communications regarding Wikileaks\u00a0and Russian hackers around the time they disseminated damaging hacked Democratic emails. \u2026 Justice Department guidelines say that a grand jury can only hear evidence after a person is indicted only if the grand jury continues to work on new charges \u2014 either against that person or against additional planned defendants. In short, when a defendant like Stone is indicted, prosecutors must already have the evidence needed to take the case they open to trial. So Miller's testimony may relate to a still-unknown criminal case.\u201d -- Stone\u2019s former associate Jerome Corsi claimed Stone expressed hope the WikiLeaks email dumps during the 2016 campaign would coincide with news of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. Isaac Stanley-Becker reports: \u201c\u2018I had one call from Roger, as I recall it \u2014 Roger disputes this \u2014 on the day that WikiLeaks did begin in October dropping the final emails on John Podesta, in which Roger was essentially saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this timing issue because the Billy Bush tape is going to be released, and we\u2019d like to have Assange begin releasing emails now,\u2019\u2019 Corsi told MSNBC\u2019s Ari Melber on Monday evening. \u2026 Corsi acknowledged that he could not \u2018prove\u2019 that the longtime Republican operative and self-described \u2018dirty trickster\u2019 had taken steps to influence the timing of the email dump. Instead, he merely shared his recollection of their phone conversation.\u201d -- William Barr once again refused to guarantee that he would publicly release Mueller\u2019s report if confirmed as attorney general. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cBarr stressed that his \u2018goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law\u2019 in several of the answers he provided to [Judiciary Committee] senators, who challenged him to offer better assurances that he would release the report than he did during a confirmation hearing earlier this month. Democrats on the panel also failed to secure a firmer promise from Barr to alert them if Justice Department ethics officials advise him to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe, reserving the final decision for himself. \u2026 On Monday, Sens. Richard J. Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, introduced a bill to guarantee that every special-counsel report would be released directly to Congress and the public, effectively taking out the attorney general as middleman.\u201d -- Barr added in his written answers to the Senate that he has discussed the Mueller probe with Vice President Pence. The AP\u2019s Eric Tucker reports: Barr said\u00a0\u201cthat he and Pence have had occasional conversations since the spring of 2017 on matters including policy and personnel. Some of those conversations included \u2018general discussion of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation in which I gave my views on such matters as Bob Mueller\u2019s high integrity and various media reports.\u2019 \u2018In these conversations, I did not provide legal advice, nor, to the best of my recollection, did he provide confidential information,\u2019 Barr told Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat.\u201d -- Trump\u2019s former attorney\u00a0Michael Cohen has agreed to testify behind closed doors before the House Intelligence Committee as he shakes up his legal team. Matt Zapotosky reports: \u201cLanny J. Davis, one of Cohen\u2019s lawyers who also has served as his media representative, said in a statement that Cohen is bringing on Michael Monico and Barry Spevack \u2014 two veteran Chicago-based lawyers from the firm Monico and Spevack \u2014 to replace Guy Petrillo and Amy Lester, who had represented him as he went through proceedings in federal court in Manhattan. A person familiar with the matter said Cohen had fallen behind in his bills to Petrillo and Lester, although Davis disputed that this led to the change. \u2026 On Monday, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Cohen had agreed to appear voluntarily before the House Intelligence Committee on Feb. 8 for nonpublic testimony. He already had been issued a subpoena to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee, also a closed-door session, and is expected to do so Feb. 12, Davis has said.\u201d -- A federal judge delayed former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u2019s sentencing on tax and bank fraud convictions, citing his ongoing dispute with Mueller\u2019s team. From Rachel Weiner: \u201cManafort\u2019s sentencing hearing in federal court in Alexandria had been set for Feb. 8. A new date has not been scheduled. The postponement was sparked by allegations made by prosecutors in Manafort\u2019s related case in D.C. federal court, where the former Trump campaign chairman pleaded guilty to crimes related to his undisclosed lobbying work. The special counsel said Manafort lied repeatedly to the FBI and a grand jury after committing to offer truthful information. Manafort, 69, has maintained that he made honest mistakes and did his best to correct them.\u201d SHUTDOWN FALLOUT: -- Trump accepted an invitation from Nancy Pelosi to reschedule his State of the Union address for Feb. 5. Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201c\u2018We have a great story to tell and yet, great goals to achieve!\u2019 he said in the letter, which was released by the White House.\u201d -- While federal employees tried to get the government back up to speed, the possibility of another shutdown in three weeks hangs over every office. Lisa Rein, Tracy Jan and Kimberly Kindy report: \u201cIn airports, security lines were moving faster after five weeks of extended absences sidelined 10 percent of the nation\u2019s baggage screeners. National Park Service rangers assessed the damage from winter weather. The Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo prepared to reopen Tuesday. The shutdown cost the American economy about $3 billion, the Congressional Budget Office estimated Monday. As they returned to work, employees were concerned that they might not receive back pay for several weeks.\u201d -- \u201cIt was a routine day, except not,\u201d Dan Zak, Caitlin Gibson and Ben Terris report of government workers\u2019 first day back at the office. \u201cLaurel Bryant works at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, up in Silver Spring. The mood Monday was joyous, like a big family reunion \u2014 if your family had to suddenly drop everything and scatter for five weeks. Everyone\u2019s equipment had to be left behind, and passwords were forgotten, but the wizards from IT were circulating, checking in with everyone, asking if all was okay. Too many people were logging on at the same time to fill out their timecards, so the system kept crashing. \u2018I came back to 4,459 emails,\u2019 Bryant said. \u2018I\u2019m down to 4,222.\u2019 It was barely past 11 a.m. \u2018I\u2019ll get through it.\u2019\u201d THE IMMIGRATION WARS RAGE ON: -- Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) said Trump hopes to reach a \u201csimple\u201d\u00a0deal on the border wall rather than a broader immigration agreement before government funding once again lapses on Feb. 15. Seung Min Kim reports: Perdue,\u00a0\u201cwho lunched privately with the president Sunday at the White House, also indicated that Trump is prepared to act on his own should a new committee on Capitol Hill struggle to come up with an agreement on the wall that satisfies him. \u2026 \u2018He wants as simple of a solution as we can get,\u2019 Perdue said in an interview Monday. While the president would like a more sweeping immigration package at some point, Perdue said Trump acknowledges \u2018that\u2019s just not realistic in three weeks.\u2019 Perdue added that while Trump is \u2018hopeful\u2019 that a new bipartisan committee of 17 lawmakers can strike a deal on modest border security, \u2018at the end of the day, if in three weeks [there is no resolution], this president\u2019s ready to move.\u2019\u201d -- Trump's 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale is encouraging the president to stand by his demand for a border wall even if it means another shutdown. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash and Bridget Nolan report: \u201cAs part of his pitch, Parscale is presenting the President with internal data that shows voters in key swing areas believe a border wall or fence is needed. After the shutdown ended, Parscale commissioned a GOP firm to test the President's job performance and his border policies in 10 swing House districts where Democrats won in November. The chosen districts allow Parscale to show how staying the course could put pressure on House Democrats and [Pelosi] to break their so far steadfast opposition to funding a border wall.\u201d -- But Senate Republicans are voicing little desire for a second shutdown, per Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett, John Bresnahan and Sarah Ferris. \u201cThough House Republicans aren\u2019t ruling out supporting the president should he choose another confrontation over his border wall, the Republican Senate majority \u2014 which actually has governing power \u2014 has another view. \u2018I did not love the shutdown. I wouldn\u2019t think anybody would have another shutdown,\u2019 said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), one of the key negotiators trying to strike a deal on border security.\u201d -- Barr refused to answer whether he would defend Trump in court if he unilaterally declares\u00a0a national emergency as a pretext to fund the wall. From Politico\u2019s Marianne Levine: \u201c\u2018I have not examined the facts and circumstances pertaining to security on the southern border with this issue in mind, and therefore, I am not in a position to further comment on what would constitute a national emergency,\u2019 Barr wrote in response to a question from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) He added that if he is confirmed, he\u2019d ensure \u2018that the Department\u2019s advice on this subject is consistent with any applicable law.\u2019\u201d -- Senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller said, \u201cI would be happy if not a single refugee foot ever again touched American soil,\u201d according to former White House communications aide Cliff Sims\u2019s new book \u201cTeam of Vipers,\u201d which hits stores today. The Associated Press reports: \u201cSims writes that, any time a refugee or immigrant committed a \u2018gruesome\u2019 crime, Miller would walk over to the White House press office to demand that press releases be issued about the cases. Sims says Miller made the comment about refugees during a conversation the two were having about immigration. \u2026 Miller did not respond to an emailed request for comment. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said during a rare televised briefing Monday, \u2018I\u2019m not aware of any statement like that that Stephen Miller has ever made.\u2019\u201d Note: That is not a denial. -- Meanwhile, the Trump Winery in Virginia has again submitted a request to hire foreign guest workers. BuzzFeed News\u2019s Jeremy Singer-Vine, Ken Bensinger and Jessica Garrison report: \u201cTrump Winery, also known as Trump Vineyard Estates, LLC, is seeking the workers under the federal H-2 visa program, which allows US employers to hire foreign laborers on a temporary basis as long as no qualified US workers want the jobs. \u2026 Businesses owned by or bearing the name of Trump \u2026 have sought to hire more than 600 foreign guest workers since he launched his presidential campaign in June 2015. Many have worked as servers and house cleaners at Mar-a-Lago as well as at the president\u2019s various golf clubs.\u201d -- A comedian based in Portland, Ore., and originally from Libya\u00a0said Border Patrol agents forced him off a Greyhound bus in Washington state and accused him of presenting false identification when they asked him for proof of citizenship. \u201cI explained to them that I was granted asylum here in the United States, and that the work permit they currently hold and the license are impossible to get unless your presence here is legal,\u201d Mohanad Elshieky said in a Twitter thread that has gone viral. \u201cThey told me that I was lying and these could pretty much be falsified.\u201d (Luz Lazo) 2020 WATCH: -- A majority of Americans say they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d not vote for Trump if the election were held today as the Democratic primary race looks wide open, according to a fresh\u00a0Post-ABC poll. Michael Scherer and Scott Clement report: \u201cWhen asked whom they would support today for the Democratic presidential nomination, 56 percent of self-identified Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents did not offer a name. No candidate received double-digit support, with former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) leading the pack. The lack of commitment on the Democratic side comes as Trump appears vulnerable to defeat in a 2020 general election, and perhaps even to a challenge from within the Republican Party. A 56 percent majority of all Americans say they would \u2018definitely not vote for him\u2019 should Trump become the Republican nominee, while 14 percent say they would consider voting for him and 28 percent would definitely vote for him. Majorities of independents (59 percent), women (64 percent) and suburbanites (56 percent) rule out supporting Trump for a second term.\u201d -- Former Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz disputed the idea that his potential independent presidential campaign would guarantee Trump a second term. NPR\u2019s Jessica Taylor reports: \u201cSchultz pushed back on that concern, arguing that he could be successful where other independent candidates haven't been by appealing to an increasingly growing center and peeling off Democratic voters put off by the party's progressive leanings. \u2018I think lifelong Democrats and many, many more lifelong Republicans than Democrats realize are looking for a home,\u2019 Schultz said. \u2018If there is a choice between President Trump and a progressive liberal-minded person on the Democratic side, it would kill me to see President Trump be re-elected, and I believe that is what would take place.\u2019\u201d -- A heckler concerned about Schultz\u2019s presidential ambitions disrupted his book tour event in New York City. Before being escorted out by security, the heckler said, \u201cDon\u2019t help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire \u2026 Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter. Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.\u201d (ABC News) -- Schultz has hired two well-known political strategists from opposite parties to help him map out a run, according to CBS News\u2019s Ed O'Keefe and Camilo Montoya-Galvez. Steve Schmidt, \u201ca former top Republican strategist, helped run George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign and the failed 2008 presidential bid by GOP Arizona Senator John McCain. [Bill] Burton helped run Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and later served as deputy White House press secretary. In June 2018, Schmidt announced he was leaving the Republican Party, tweeting in June that it had become \u2018fully the party of Trump.\u2019 Schmidt has been long rumored as a potential Schultz aide, given that he has spoken out publicly about the potential openings for an independent candidate. Burton, who once considered running for Congress from Buffalo, is based in California and is leaving his role with the Democratic media strategy firm SKDKnickerbocker.\u201d -- Kamala Harris said she would support ending private insurance to enact Medicare-for-all.\u00a0CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby and Gregory Krieg report: \u201c\u2018We need to have Medicare-for-all,\u2019 Harris told a questioner in the audience [at her CNN town hall], noting it's something she feels \u2018very strongly\u2019 about. When pressed by CNN's Jake Tapper if that means eliminating private insurance, the senator answered affirmatively, saying she would be OK with cutting insurers out of the mix. She also accused them of thinking only of their bottom lines and of burdening Americans with paperwork and approval processes. \u2026 It was an answer that Republicans immediately jumped on. Michael Ahrens, rapid response director for the Republican National Committee, said on Twitter, \u2018Dems in 2019: If you like your plan, we're eliminating it.\u2019\u201d -- Harris could face hurdles trying to achieve the same level of support Barack Obama received from black voters during the 2008 Democratic primaries. The New York Times\u2019s Astead W. Herndon and Susan Chira report: \u201cIn many ways, she is well positioned: Ms. Harris is the most high-profile and politically connected black woman ever to run for president, and she can also draw on her powerful alumni networks from Howard University, one of the most prominent historically black colleges, and Alpha Kappa Alpha, the oldest black sorority. Yet interviews with more than 30 black voters and political leaders in early primary states like South Carolina and her home state, California, show that Ms. Harris faces challenges. She will have to persuade black activists skeptical of her record as a prosecutor; overcome sexism and a bias on the part of some voters that a female candidate cannot beat [Trump]; and work to gain broader support from black men, who generally expressed more wariness about Ms. Harris in interviews than black women.\u201d -- Joe Biden told a crowd in Florida he will \u201cmake the decision soon.\u201d From Politico\u2019s Marc Caputo: \u201cBiden made his remarks about his future plans during a question-and-answer portion of an event billed as \u2018An Evening with Vice President Joe Biden\u2019 at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts, which had so many people in attendance that Biden said even his daughter wondered about 2020. \u2018Dad, are we running?\u2019 Biden said she told him as they walked in. \u2018The answer,\u2019 Biden said to the crowd, \u2018is that I\u2019m running the traps on this. I don\u2019t want to make this a fool\u2019s errand. I\u2019m a lot closer than I was before Christmas and we\u2019ll make the decision soon.\u2019\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Trump attacked Sen.

Over lunch at New York\u2019s five-star Peninsula Hotel, the white-bearded visitor, who said his name was Michel Lambert, praised Mr. Scott-Railton\u2019s work and pried for details about Citizen Lab. Then \u2014 \u2018as I was finishing my cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e,\u2019 Mr. Scott-Railton said \u2014 a reporter and photographer from The Associated Press, alerted by Mr. Scott-Railton and lurking nearby, confronted the visitor, who bumped into chairs and circled the room while trying to flee. \u2026 The case of the bumbling spy is the latest episode involving undercover agents, working for private intelligence firms or other clients, who adopt false identities to dig up compromising information about or elicit embarrassing statements from their targets.\u201d -- \u201cLifestyle guru B.

Smith. Six years ago, she was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u2026 Not long after, B.\u2019s restaurants shuttered. Her appearances dried up. With Dan Gasby, her husband and business partner of more than two decades, she turned her efforts to speaking about Alzheimer\u2019s and advocating for research. Then, she didn\u2019t do much talking at all. \u2026 Dan had never been the type to bite his tongue, never bothered with niceties. At 64, he had a wife, and he had a girlfriend named Alex Lerner.

It included a somber image of a candle and a star-shaped yellow badge, the symbol the Nazis forced Jewish people to wear during the Holocaust to identify and psychologically isolate them. The GOP chapter then added its own note: \u2018Leftism kills,\u2019 the caption began. \u2018In memory of the 6 million Jews lost to Nazi hatred in the name of National Socialism. We will never forget.\u2019 Many decried the post as offensive and accused the group of politicizing one of history\u2019s greatest atrocities.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT: \u201c'No Reason For It Except to Intimidate': Chris Christie Rips Mueller for Ordering Stone Raid,\u201d from Fox News: \u201cFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Monday on \u2018Hannity\u2019 that though he has defended [Mueller] in the past, the raid on Roger Stone's home was indefensible. Christie said that, if the Mueller team knew Stone owned no weapons and had not posed a threat, then there was \u2018no reason\u2019 for the show of force Mueller ordered the FBI to display in Fort Lauderdale on Friday. \u2018There's no reason except to intimidate [Stone],\u2019 Christie, a Republican from Mendham, said. Christie, who noted he served for seven years as the federal prosecutor for the District of New Jersey, said the raid was an \u2018inappropriate use of prosecutorial authority\u2019 by Mueller.\u201d \u00a0 DAYBOOK: Trump has no events on his public schedule today.

From Peter Jamison: \u201cThe joint hearing by the council\u2019s health and judiciary committees served as a cathartic moment for advocates and medical professionals who bemoaned what they described as years of missed opportunities to save lives. \u2026 It was not immediately clear what new initiatives or legislation could emerge from the hearing, which ran uninterrupted for more than nine hours and touched on topics including the need for more street outreach to heroin users and the possibility of government-supervised sites where drug users can inject heroin.\u201d -- Republican leaders of the Virginia House of Delegates backed a plan to establish an independent redistricting commission. Gregory S. Schneider reports: \u201cThe plan rolled out Monday by Del. Mark L.

No. They didn\u2019t go to jail. They got a trillion-dollar bailout.\u201d  \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), in a speech in North Charleston, S.C., March 15, 2019 Sanders, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, includes a version of this line in his stump speeches \u2014 as part of a slew of statements that he says demonstrates how the system is rigged in favor of the rich and powerful. But his language is a bit slippery and exaggerated. Let\u2019s take a look. Notice how Sanders says \u201cnot one major Wall Street executive\u201d went to jail? That\u2019s because there was actually one Wall Street official who did go to jail: Kareem Serageldin, who was global head of structured credit at Credit Suisse Group and admitted trying to hide hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. We won\u2019t try to debate whether Serageldin was a \u201cmajor\u201d executive. Sanders\u2019s larger point is valid: According to the New York Times, almost 900 executives went to jail for the savings and loan scandal in the 1980s, compared with just one person in the 2008 financial crisis. Even the judge who sentenced Serageldin to 30 months in prison was troubled that his conduct was just \u201ca small piece of an overall evil climate within the bank and with many other banks.\u201d But did Wall Street get a $1 trillion bailout? That\u2019s a nice round number for rhetorical purposes, but it\u2019s not borne out by the facts. The core of the financial bailout was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which Congress passed in 2008 and was run by the Treasury Department. The limit for aid was originally set at $700 billion, but Congress in 2010 reduced it to $475 billion. ProPublica maintains a great tracker on TARP spending, and it shows that banks and other financial institutions received $245 billion, mostly to replenish capital. But many of those banks are not what one would consider \u201cWall Street.\u201d Many community banks and credit unions also received TARP funds. Looking just at the big Wall Street banks, we count $135 billion: Citigroup ($45 billion), Bank of America ($45 billion), JP Morgan Chase ($25 billion), Goldman Sachs ($10 billion) and Morgan Stanley ($10 billion). But we can take a more expansive definition and say every bank counts as Wall Street. So that\u2019s $245 billion. We can also include the U.S. government takeover of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ($191 billion), which help keep the housing market functioning. We could also add the U.S. government\u2019s purchase of much of American International Group ($67.8 billion), an insurance company central to many financial transactions, such as credit default swaps. That adds up to just over $500 billion \u2014 or half a trillion. But this is an expansive definition. The Congressional Budget Office, in a 2015 report, says support for financial institutions added up to $313 billion. So that\u2019s less than one-third of $1 trillion. TARP, after all, was not just for big banks. The automobile industry received nearly $80 billion. Adding in every possible loan and investment, including to automakers, gets you to about $632 billion, according to ProPublica. That\u2019s still not $1 trillion. It\u2019s worth remembering that while financial institutions were bailed out, so were the American people. If these banks and other financial institutions had collapsed, many companies would have soon followed, leading to massive layoffs. The collapse of AIG would have had global impact. Moreover, in the case of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG, shareholders were basically wiped out when the government took them over, so it\u2019s not as if the owners of all of the companies that received TARP funds or other government aid were \u201cbailed out.\u201d Moreover, the U.S. government was eventually repaid for the loans by many of the recipients and ended up earning, as of Feb. 25, a profit of more than $100 billion through dividends, interest and so forth, according to ProPublica. When we shared these numbers with Arianna Jones, a spokeswoman for the Sanders campaign, she responded: \u201cIf anything, Senator Sanders has underestimated the size of the post-crisis bailouts.\u201d She pointed to a number of articles and reports that the Federal Reserve made loans to financial firms totaling anywhere from $7.7 trillion to $29 trillion during the crisis. The wide range of these estimates suggests that they should be viewed with skepticism. The Federal Reserve at the time said the reports were \u201cwildly inaccurate.\u201d One problem is that the calculations appear to count every loan as a new loan, even if it was simply rolled over to a new period. One of the reports on the Federal Reserve that Jones shared, from the Government Accountability Office in 2011, stated: \u201cLoans outstanding for the emergency programs peaked at more than $1 trillion in late 2008.\u201d The Fed, which is not a federal agency, during the crisis created special lending facilities and had the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) extend credit to AIG. The special lending facilities were ended in 2010, and the loans were repaid, with huge profits being generated. \u201cThe emergency programs that have closed have not incurred losses and FRBNY does not project any losses on its outstanding loans,\u201d the GAO said. To some extent, there is a definitional issue about what one considers a bailout. The Fed loans were fully collateralized and were permitted under the Federal Reserve Act. The Fed aid was aimed mainly at keeping the financial markets operating. For instance, the commercial paper market \u2014 short-term loans essential to corporations for meeting liabilities such as workers\u2019 payroll \u2014 was believed to be basically frozen until the Fed acted. If that\u2019s the case, the entire U.S. economy would have ground to a halt without the Fed\u2019s intervention. Moreover, the Fed remits its excess profits to the U.S. Treasury, so all of the gains from the New York Fed\u2019s extraordinary facilities were paid to the U.S. government. Our colleague Allan Sloan has estimated that the Fed earned $132 billion in profit from 2007 to 2012 on the special lending facilities, which it, in turn, delivered to the U.S. government. \u201cAs far as Federal Reserve lending is concerned, I do not see how you can call it a bailout when loans were repaid with a profit,\u201d said James D. Hamilton, professor of economics at the University of California at San Diego. He said the cumulative total net gains to the U.S. Treasury from Federal Reserve operations from the first quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2017 came to $819 billion.  We will note that although the Sanders campaign pointed to these reports of the Fed lending trillions of dollars during the crisis, he does not make such claims in his speech. Sanders clearly wants to use a nice round number in his speeches \u2014 $1 trillion \u2014 when he complains about the leniency shown to Wall Street firms during the financial crisis. But it\u2019s really about one-third to one-half that number, even when you use generous definitions for \u201cWall Street.\u201d Whether the Fed efforts should be added to these numbers is a matter of debate. We would not include them \u2014 and apparently neither would Sanders. Otherwise, he would be claiming a $30 trillion bailout, not a $1 trillion bailout. Not only was Wall Street bailed out, but also the whole U.S. economy \u2014 at a profit of more than $200 billion for U.S. taxpayers. That point is frequently lost in the political discussion over whether the bailouts were worthwhile. We presume Sanders is not suggesting that the U.S. government should not have taken extraordinary actions to stabilize the financial markets. Still, a lot depends on how you crunch the numbers and what one includes as part of the bailout of \u201cWall Street.\u201d Sanders is also right that no major Wall Street official went to jail.

Mueller III that there was no coordination or conspiracy involving Trump campaign officials or associates and the Russians, despite myriad contacts that have been documented, was a sweet moment. He will not only savor the moment; he will stuff it down the throats of all those who claimed otherwise. The tweets in all caps began Sunday and will continue for months. For Democrats, the Mueller report turns upside down the politics of what lies ahead. From what seemed a position of strength, or at least the ability to stay on offense, they are now looking at the road ahead in a far more problematic position. The issue of impeachment was always in question, given House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s cautionary view. At this point, it is off the table. Beyond that are difficult questions about what investigations House Democrats should pursue and to what end. For nearly two years, Democrats have eagerly awaited the Mueller report, having already connected many of the dots of contacts between Trump associates and the Russians. Now that Mueller has finished his work with no additional indictments, with a finding of no collusion and a decision of no judgment on whether Trump obstructed justice, things have changed significantly. Democrats must now reckon with a far different set of political realities. In a four-page letter released Sunday, Attorney General William P. Barr outlined the broad conclusions of the Mueller report but provided only the barest of information about what is in the document. Many, many questions remain, and deservedly so. The most important of those is what Mueller found about possible obstruction of justice by Trump. The special counsel and his team punted on that question. According to Barr\u2019s letter, Mueller states that \u201cwhile this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u201d In their review of the evidence, Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein concluded that what Mueller presented did not meet the standards required to charge the president with obstruction. Others are likely to read the evidence another way, which is why Democrats are demanding that Barr release the full report, as well as the underlying evidence, as soon as possible. The details will be hugely important. Barr on Friday promised as much transparency as possible; on Sunday, he outlined some boundaries \u2014 grand jury testimony, for example \u2014 that could keep some of the evidence from public view. Democrats and Republicans have said that it is in the public interest for the full report to released, although it could be a while before that happens. But is the absence of a conclusion or recommendation about obstruction a gift for the Democrats or a trap? By declining to exonerate the president, Mueller has whetted the appetites of those who believe, based simply on what is already in the public domain, that Trump repeatedly sought to interfere with the special counsel\u2019s work. They are understandably eager to pursue this question, not only by demanding the full report, but by calling Barr and Mueller to testify. They will do this, however, with the issue clouded by partisanship. Some Democrats are claiming that Barr was not willing to charge Trump because he doesn\u2019t believe that a sitting president can be indicted. Barr wrote that his and Rosenstein\u2019s decision \u201cwas made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president.\u201d That won\u2019t satisfy those who think the president obstructed justice. But it is all that Trump\u2019s allies will need to argue against those who pursue an obstruction charge.","136":"Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort appeals for compassion to Judge T.S. Ellis III during his sentencing hearing on Thursday in\u00a0Alexandria, Va. (Courtroom sketch by Dana Verkouteren\/AP) With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort faced up to 24 years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines for the bank and tax fraud he was convicted of in Virginia, but U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis said that would be \u201cexcessive.\u201d Last night, Ellis sentenced Manafort to just under four years. Manafort, 69, sat in a wheelchair and wore a green jumpsuit as he pleaded for \u201ccompassion\u201d from Ellis, who is 78. The defendant thanked the judge for giving him a fair trial. \u201cTo say that I feel humiliated and ashamed would be a gross understatement,\u201d Manafort said. Ellis defended his decision by noting that Manafort has no prior convictions. \u201cHe\u2019s lived an otherwise blameless life,\u201d the judge said, adding that anyone who doesn\u2019t think the sentence is tough should \u201cgo and spend a day [or] a week in jail \u2026 He has to spend 47 months.\u201d Rachel Weiner, who has spent a lot of time watching Ellis as our beat reporter in his courthouse, said what surprised her the most was that the judge usually places a high degree of importance on a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. He even called out Manafort yesterday for not doing so, yet he didn't punish him for it. -- A chorus of Democratic presidential candidates quickly seized on the news to offer broader critiques of the justice system. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said the federal guidelines are \u201cthere for a reason\u201d and that the criminality Manafort was convicted of played out over several years. \u201cCrimes committed in an office building should be treated as seriously as crimes committed on a street corner,\u201d said Klobuchar, who was the district attorney for the county that includes Minneapolis before winning her seat in 2006. \u201cCan\u2019t have two systems of justice!\u201d Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he is \u201creally ticked off\u201d but no longer surprised by white-collar criminals getting treated better than the poor and people of color. \u201cYou can tell a lot about a country by who they incarcerate,\u201d Booker told Stephen Colbert in a taped interview that will air tonight on CBS. \u201cIn Russia, they incarcerate political opposition. In Turkey, they are actually incarcerating the media. \u2026 But in our country, we prey on the most vulnerable citizens in our nation: poor folks, mentally ill folks, addicted folks and overwhelmingly black and brown folks.\u201d Booker, the former mayor of Newark, lamented the costs of the war on drugs. \u201cThere are people from neighborhoods like mine in America who get convictions for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing,\u201d he said. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) pointed to the plight of a specific nonviolent drug offender:\u00a0 -- Criticizing Manafort\u2019s sentence, Monica Lewinsky said Ken Starr\u2019s team threatened her with 27 years in prison if she didn\u2019t flip on Bill Clinton: -- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who is too young to run for president but gets as much coverage as any of the candidates, said the case proves that justice isn\u2019t blind: -- \u201cManafort has already spent nine months in jail \u2014 meaning the sentence imposed Thursday could end in less than three years, with an additional reduction for good behavior. \u2026 But he still faces sentencing for related conspiracy charges in a case in D.C. federal court \u2014 in which he could receive an additional 10-year prison term,\u201d Weiner, Lynh Bui, Justin Jouvenal and Devlin Barrett report. The onetime GOP power broker will find out his fate in that case next Wednesday. The judge is Amy Berman Jackson. Appointed by Barack Obama, she\u2019s also presiding over Roger Stone\u2019s case. She has the discretion to decide whether the sentences will run simultaneously or back to back. This will make a big difference in how much time Manafort spends behind bars. Special counsel Bob Mueller wants to throw the book at Manafort after he allegedly reneged on a plea deal in the D.C. case. At yesterday\u2019s hearing, Manafort\u2019s attorneys said their client spent 50 hours in proffer sessions with Mueller\u2019s team for the D.C. case. Prosecutor Greg Andres replied that it was worthless. \u201cHe did not provide valuable cooperation,\u201d Andres said. \u201cHe lied.\u201d -- A string of defense attorneys, especially public defenders, pointed to much harsher sentences doled out to\u00a0people for non-white-collar crimes than what Manafort got from Ellis. Mueller\u2019s team laid out evidence during the Virginia trial that Manafort, by concealing $16 million in income, didn\u2019t pay $6 million he would have owed in federal taxes, among other crimes. \u201cScott Hechinger, a senior staff attorney at Brooklyn Defender Services, an organization that provides legal representation to defendants who cannot afford it, used one of his recent clients, who was just offered a 36-to-72-month sentence, as an example. The crime? Stealing $100-worth of quarters from a residential laundry room. Hechinger\u2019s client may wind up doing more time than Manafort, a man who defrauded the Internal Revenue Service out of $6 million,\u201d Reis Thebault and Michael Brice-Saddler report. \u201cHechinger listed a half dozen more examples. Among them were a Brooklyn teenager who got a 19-years-to-life sentence for burning a mattress in the hallway of his apartment building, resulting in the smoke-inhalation death of an officer who responded to the scene. He also cited the case of Cyrstal Mason, an ex-felon who was sent back to prison for five years after voting in the 2016 presidential election while on probation \u2014 an act she says she didn\u2019t know was illegal.\u201d Louis Laverone, an international financial crimes attorney, pointed to the case of a Turkish banker who was charged with participating in a multibillion-dollar scheme and violating U.S. economic sanctions. In that case, guidelines called for a possible 105-year sentence. He got 32 months. -- In years past, Ellis has complained about \u2013 but complied with \u2013 mandatory minimum sentences set by Congress. But there are no mandatory minimums for the crimes Manafort was convicted of. Last summer, Ellis sentenced a 37-year-old man to 40 years of hard time for dealing methamphetamine. \u201cI chafe a bit at that, but I follow the law,\u201d Ellis said when he handed down the sentence, per Politico\u2019s Josh Gerstein. \u201cIf I thought it was blatantly immoral, I\u2019d have to resign. It\u2019s wrong, but not immoral.\u201d -- The Atlantic\u2019s Frank Foer, who wrote a truly exceptional cover story about Manafort last year, upbraided the judge over his statement that the convict \u201chas lived an otherwise blameless life.\u201d \u201cIn an otherwise blameless life, he helped the Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos bolster his image in Washington after he assassinated his primary political opponent,\u201d Foer writes in a blog post that went up overnight. \u201cIn an otherwise blameless life, he worked to keep arms flowing to the Angolan generalissimo Jonas Savimbi, a monstrous leader bankrolled by the apartheid government in South Africa. \u2026 In otherwise blameless life, he produced a public-relations campaign to convince Washington that Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was acting within his democratic rights and duties when he imprisoned his most compelling rival for power. In an otherwise blameless life, he stood mute as Yanukovych\u2019s police killed 130 protesters in the Maidan. \u2026 \u201cIn an otherwise blameless life, he attempted to phone a potential witness in his trial, so that they could align their stories. \u2026 In an otherwise blameless life, he acted with impunity, as if the laws never applied to him. \u2026 And with Ellis\u2019s featherweight punishment, \u2026 Manafort managed to bring his life\u2019s project to a strange completion. He had devoted his career to normalizing corruption in Washington. By the time he was caught, his extraordinary avarice had become so commonplace that not even a federal judge could blame him for it.\u201d -- The Washington Post yesterday asked the federal court in D.C. to unseal records in Manafort\u2019s case. \u201cAt issue are redacted or sealed filings, sentencing memos, hearing transcripts and more than 800 pages of exhibits submitted after the special counsel\u2019s office alleged in November that Manafort voided his cooperation agreement,\u201d Richard Leiby reports. \u201cProsecutors submitted the materials to substantiate their allegations but did so under seal or with heavy redactions, arguing that information related to uncharged individuals or ongoing criminal investigations, including secret grand jury matters, should not become public.\u201d Statement from Post Executive Editor Martin Baron: \u201cThe long-standing principle of open criminal proceedings deserves to be sustained in this important case, especially considering that it comes in the context of an investigation into the integrity of a presidential election and relentless attacks on the investigation itself.\u201d Ivanka Trump and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross arrive in the State Dining Room at the White House on Wednesday for an event with President Trump. (Jabin Botsford\/The Washington Post) FOLLOW THE MONEY: -- Senior Democratic investigators are moving to open an oversight probe into whether Ivanka Trump has benefited personally from her position as a White House senior adviser, including through Chinese regulators\u2019 approval of trademarks for her apparel company. \u201cBut investigating Ivanka Trump is so politically sensitive that Democrats are proceeding with caution,\u201d Rachael Bade, Phil Rucker and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cIt is unclear even which House committee would take the lead; aides for several panels with jurisdiction suggested that other committees may be better suited to probing the president\u2019s eldest daughter. \u2026 (The president) has said privately he does not want his children testifying on Capitol Hill or providing documents to their investigations. \u2026\u00a0 \u201cLast May, China approved more than a half-dozen Ivanka trademarks around the time Trump shielded a major Chinese state-owned equipment company from U.S. sanctions. The year before, Ivanka\u2019s clothing line saw the same trademark boon the same day she dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. \u2026 Abbe Lowell, the attorney for Ivanka Trump, did not respond to a request for comment.\u201d Top Democrats said yesterday that Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, will not get special treatment. \u201cWhomever falls into that net, falls into that net,\u201d said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). \u201cThey are advisers to the president. They have security clearances. This is not their children at home.\u201d House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) added: \u201cThey have to be as accountable as everybody else. We\u2019ve got to do our job.\u201d -- A White House source reportedly leaked documents related to Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner\u2019s security clearance process to the House Oversight Committee.\u00a0(Axios) -- Michael Cohen sued the Trump Organization to cover millions of dollars in legal fees. Felicia Sonmez reports: The president's former fixer\u00a0\u201csaid in a lawsuit filed Thursday in New York that the Trump Organization had breached a July 2017 agreement under which it agreed to cover the costs Cohen incurred while participating in ongoing investigations into his work for the company. Cohen is seeking more than $1.9 million in attorneys\u2019 fees as well as an additional $1.9 million that he has been ordered to pay as part of his sentence for crimes he committed while working for Trump. \u2026 It alleges that after initially paying some of Cohen\u2019s legal fees, the Trump Organization stopped paying him in June 2018, once it \u2018became clear that Mr. Cohen would cooperate in ongoing investigations into his work\u2019 on behalf of the company and Trump.\u201d -- Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg is well known among his colleagues for being dependable to the point of dullness, but the congressional investigations could force him into the limelight.

(Wall Street Journal) A DIVIDED AMERICA:\u00a0 -- The House overwhelmingly passed a broad, watered-down \u201canti-hate\u201d resolution that was originally intended as a response to allegedly anti-Semitic comments from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) but that wound up not mentioning her. Mike DeBonis, Felicia Sonmez and John Wagner report: \u201cThe 407-to-23 vote capped days of frustration and anger over the comments by [Omar] that have overshadowed Democratic policies \u2014 both legislation and investigations\u00a0\u2014 and raised questions about whether [Pelosi] could keep her fractious caucus together.\u201d In the end, no Democrats opposed the measure\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including Omar \u2014\u00a0while all 23 \"nay\" votes were Republicans. -- House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) attracted controversy before the vote by claiming that Omar\u2019s experience with hate as a refugee was \u201cmore personal\u201d than that of the children of Holocaust survivors. Felicia Sonmez and Mike DeBonis report: \u201cIn the interview with the Hill, Clyburn said he had spoken at length with Omar, who was born in Somalia and fled with her family to a refu\u00adgee camp in Kenya where she lived for four years as a child. She \u2018is living through a lot of pain,\u2019 Clyburn told the newspaper, drawing a contrast between Omar\u2019s firsthand experience and the perspectives of those whose parents or grandparents survived the Holocaust or other historical atrocities. \u2018There are people who tell me, \u2018Well, my parents are Holocaust survivors.\u2019 \u2018My parents did this.\u2019 It\u2019s more personal with her,\u2019 Clyburn said in the interview.\u201d -- \u201cOnly one thing can save Trump now: Democrats,\u201d Dana Milbank writes of the whole ugly squabble. -- Two officials at ICE shared or approved of social media posts that spread false conspiracy theories about Omar.\u00a0BuzzFeed News\u2019s Hamed Aleaziz reports: \u201cA post shared on LinkedIn by senior ICE agent Leslie Derewonko and \u2018liked\u2019 by Jerry Templet, the second-in-command of Homeland Security Investigations in San Francisco, insinuated that [Omar] was a terrorist threat.

Scott Applewhite\/AP) JOE BIDEN\u2019S PAST WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT HIM IF HE RUNS: -- As the former vice president moves toward a campaign\u00a0announcement in early April, his long paper trail of comments on race and gender that put him deeply at odds with today's Democratic Party will enter heavier\u00a0circulation and could imperil his third try for the presidency.\u00a0Matt Viser has an important story in today's newspaper\u00a0about Biden's role, while a freshman senator from Delaware in the 1970s, as a leading opponent of school busing. He spoke out repeatedly and forcefully against sending white children to majority-black schools and black children to majority-white schools. Not only did Biden\u00a0play down the persistence of overt racism, in fact, but he also suggested the government should play only a limited role in integration. \u201cBiden, 76, declined to be interviewed for this article. But his spokesman, Bill Russo, said the former vice president still believes he was right to oppose busing,\u201d Matt reports. Keep that in mind as you read these quotes from the story: \u201cI do not buy the concept, popular in the \u201960s, which said, \u2018We have suppressed the black man for 300 years and the white man is now far ahead in the race for everything our society offers. In order to even the score, we must now give the black man a head start, or even hold the white man back, to even the race.\u2019 I don\u2019t buy that,\u201d\u00a0Biden told a Delaware-based weekly newspaper in 1975.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather. I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation. And I\u2019ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.\u201d -- In a 1993 speech, Biden warned of \u201cpredators on our streets\u201d who were \u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d\u00a0CNN\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski reports: \u201cBiden, then chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the comments on the Senate floor a day before a vote was scheduled on the Senate's version of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. \u2026 \u2018We have predators on our streets that society has in fact, in part because of its neglect, created,\u2019 said Biden, then a fourth-term senator from Delaware so committed to the bill that he has referred to it over the years as \u2018the Biden bill.\u2019 \u2018They are beyond the pale many of those people, beyond the pale,\u2019 Biden continued. \u2018And it's a sad commentary on society. We have no choice but to take them out of society.\u2019\u201d -- Hmmm: While Biden has bragged for at least a decade that his Senate colleagues derisively called him \u201cMiddle-Class Joe,\u201d there is no evidence that anyone has ever actually done so,\u00a0HuffPost\u2019s Arthur Delaney reports.\u00a0 -- Meanwhile, Wall Street executives are pinning their hopes on Biden after Michael Bloomberg said he won't run,\u00a0Vanity Fair\u2019s Tina Nguyen reports. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio)\u00a0visits Selma, Ala., last weekend. (Julie Bennett\/AP) 2020 WATCH: -- Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) announced that he won't run in 2020. David Weigel and Chelsea Janes report: \"Brown, who had never seriously considered a presidential bid until urged to do so after the 2016 election, found that he did not have the same investment in a run as other Democrats. He was also encouraged on hearing several rival candidates adopt his \u2018dignity of work\u2019 motto on the trail, seeing that as evidence that the party was not making the same blunders that it had ahead of Trump\u2019s win.\" -- The two biggest winners from Sherrod\u2019s decision not to run: Bernie Sanders and Chuck Schumer. -- Brown will continue to be a force in the Senate: The 66-year-old is the top Democrat on the Banking Committee. -- Former attorney general Eric Holder said the next Democratic president should \u201cseriously\u201d consider packing the Supreme Court. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Stein reports: \u201cThe comments came during a discussion Holder held with the Yale Law National Security Group. There was no recording of the event and only a snippet of what Holder said was tweeted out publicly. But a spokesman for Holder confirmed to The Daily Beast that he did embrace the idea of court-packing. \u2026 Holder\u2019s willingness to entertain the idea of court packing makes him one of the most senior Democratic officials to do so. To date, virtually all elected Democrats have either ignored the proposal or dismissed it out of hand. The one 2020 Democratic candidate who has said that court packing should be a consideration is South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\u201d -- Unlike many of her primary competitors, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D) has so far failed to pick up endorsements from her fellow New York lawmakers. The New York Times\u2019s Shane Goldmacher reports: \u201cNo one from New York\u2019s 21-member congressional delegation is yet backing her bid for president. And neither is New York\u2019s governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, or its other senator, Chuck Schumer, who as minority leader is staying neutral because numerous senators are in the race. \u2026 Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s missing support back home is revealing of both her New York relationships and how she has constructed her national profile, often by staying far from the state\u2019s notoriously fractious and rough-and-tumble fray. \u2026 It\u2019s not that Ms. Gillibrand and her aides have not been trying. This week, she invited the full New York delegation to her Washington home next Wednesday for drinks. It\u2019s just that no endorsements have materialized so far.\u201d -- Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) is positioning himself to launch a presidential campaign focused on criticizing Trump\u2019s national security agenda. The Atlantic\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere reports: \u201cMoulton told me he will run through VFW halls and college campuses, leaning in on a national-security focus which, even in a field this huge, he is all alone in focusing on\u2014a stance that not only differentiates him, but could eventually draw the others out on foreign affairs. \u2026 Moulton has set his timeline for making a final decision at two months, by about May. He hasn\u2019t started fundraising or hiring a staff. But he\u2019s acting as if he has already entered the race. On March 19 and 20, he\u2019ll be in South Carolina \u2026 and he has plans to visit the other early-primary states by the end of April.\u201d -- Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) wants to decriminalize sex work. BuzzFeed News\u2019s Dominic Holden reports: \u201cGabbard\u2019s embrace of the issue comes just days after Sen. Bernie Sanders was asked for his position and didn\u2019t have one. \u2018That\u2019s a good question, and I don\u2019t have an answer for that,\u2019 he told The Breakfast Club.\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) opposed a sex work decriminalization measure in 2008, but when asked by the Root last month whether\u00a0she supports decriminalization now she said \u201cI think so. I do.\u201d -- \u201cHoward Schultz has recruited at least three veteran House Republican staffers and consultants to join his presidential campaign-in-waiting,\u201d per the Hill\u2019s Scott Wong: \u201cThey include Brendon DelToro and Matt LoParco, who served as deputy political director and external affairs director, respectively, to former National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) Chairman Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) during the 2018 cycle. A third Schultz hire, GOP consultant Greg Strimple, founder of GS Strategy Group, has done polling and other consulting for the NRCC, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund. \u2026 In an interview, Stivers said former NRCC staffers are free to do what they want but called it \u2018frustrating\u2019 that some would choose to work for a man who is looking to oust Trump next year.\u201d -- Good history lesson: Trump has revived the old Republican jab of referring to the Democratic Party as the \u201cDemocrat Party.\u201d Paul Farhi reports: \u201cReferences to \u2018the Democrat Party\u2019 \u2014 and variants in which \u2018Democrat\u2019 is used as a modifier \u2014 have been around for decades, rising and falling over the years.\u00a0\u2026 According to the late New York Times political columnist and language aficionado\u00a0William Safire, Minnesota Gov.\u00a0Harold Stassen\u00a0(R) urged Republican nominee Wendell Wilkie to use the phrase during the 1940 presidential campaign. Stassen, who managed Wilkie\u2019s campaign, told Safire in 1984 that he did so to emphasize that the Democratic Party wasn\u2019t especially democratic \u2014 that it was controlled by party bosses and big-city political machines.\u201d -- Trump\u2019s CPAC speech revealed he will continue to focus on appealing to his base in 2020 at the expense of moderate voters, Ronald Brownstein writes for the Atlantic:\u00a0\u201cTrump may have synthesized the essence of his reelection strategy in just three words toward the back end of his two-hour harangue: \u2018I\u2019ll protect you.\u2019 \u2026 The comment underscored his determination to convince his followers of a two-stage proposition: First, that they are \u2018under siege,\u2019 as he put it, by an array of forces that he presented as either hostile to their interests or contemptuous of their values, and second, that only he can shield them from those threats. That dark and martial message shows that Trump continues to prioritize energizing his core supporters\u2014blue-collar, older, and nonurban whites uneasy about demographic, cultural, and economic change\u2014even at the price of further alienating voters dismayed or disgusted by his behavior as president.\u201d -- Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s team is already looking for possible staffers in New Hampshire, sources\u00a0told WMUR\u2019s John DiStaso.\u00a0People close to O\u2019Rourke have reportedly reached out to strategists in the Granite State as the former Texas congressman continues to hold off on a presidential campaign decision. THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- As its self-described caliphate falls,\u00a0the Islamic State is seeding sleeper cells across parts of Syria and Iraq for a future insurgency. Louisa Loveluck reports: \u201cConditions in Deir al-Zour province, where the Islamic State is mounting its final stand, remain unusually fertile for the militants. Clandestine cells are active in several areas, where shattered villages and vast tracts of desert are difficult to police, experts say. Across the porous border in Iraq, the central government has regained control over areas once occupied by the militants. But corruption and sectarian discrimination remain a problem, and the long-standing mistrust between residents and state security forces \u2014 which fueled local support for the Islamic State in the past \u2014 has not gone away.\u201d -- Fearing a darkening global economy\u00a0driven by a slowdown in China, plus Brexit and Trump\u2019s trade wars,\u00a0the \u00a0European Central Bank unveiled a new economic rescue package and cut its 2019 growth forecast by nearly one-third. The announcement sounded alarms about a looming global slowdown that caught many off guard. David J. Lynch reports: \u201c\u2018It\u2019s a highly significant move,\u2019 said Adam Tooze, a Columbia University historian and author of \u2018Crashed,\u2019 a history of recent financial crises. \u2026 Despite the accumulation of bad news, the global economy is still likely to grow this year. The bigger concern is that central banks like the ECB have little ammunition to fight a deeper downturn, whether triggered by events in Europe or elsewhere. \u2026 In the United States, the Fed\u2019s benchmark lending rate is less than one-half what it was on the eve of the global financial crisis. So Chair Jerome H. Powell would have little room to cut rates to spur growth if a recession occurs.\u201d -- A massive power outage has left much of Venezuela in the dark, shutting down the capital\u2019s metro and sending thousands of people into the streets as the South American nation remains in a political standoff.

But the latest statement is notable for its timing and forcefulness about the latest war games. \u2018It is a violent violation of the joint declarations and statements that North Korea reached with the U.S. and South Korea,\u2019 KCNA wrote. \u2026 Meanwhile, satellite images released Thursday showed North Korea appeared to have completed rebuilding work at a satellite rocket launchpad and engine test site.\u201d -- The U.S. is asking North Korea for access to a missile base that Pyongyang appears to be rehabilitating and that the U.S. once thought was shut down.\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u2019s Michael R.

Yet even at this early stage, it has sent shock waves through the departments of Defense and State, where officials fear it will be an especially large affront to stalwart U.S. allies in Asia and Europe already questioning the depth of Trump\u2019s commitment to them. \u2026 Critics argue that the demand also misreads the benefits that overseas troop deployments bring to the U.S.\" -- Former president Jimmy Carter, who once brokered a nuclear deal with Kim's grandfather, reportedly offered to visit North Korea to once again try to\u00a0break the nuclear stalemate. Politico\u2019s Carla Marinucci reports: \u201cCarter, now 94, no longer travels but told [Rep.

Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said the Pentagon is planning on diverting $1 billion in leftover funds from military pay and pension accounts to help pay for Trump's wall. The AP\u2019s Andrew Taylor and Lisa Mascaro report: \u201cDurbin said the funds are available because Army recruitment is down and a voluntary early military retirement program is being underutilized. \u2026 Durbin said, \u2018Imagine the Democrats making that proposal \u2014 that for whatever our project is, we\u2019re going to cut military pay and pensions.\u2019 \u2026 The Pentagon is planning to transfer money from various accounts into a fund dedicated to drug interdiction, with the money then slated to be redirected for border barriers and other purposes.\" -- Though the administration has yet to identify which specific military projects will be tapped to pay for the wall, the White House continues pressuring undecided Republicans to support the president\u2019s emergency declaration. Erica Werner and Seung Min Kim report: \u201cMany Senate Republicans say that they would like more information before they decide whether to vote to protect Trump\u2019s emergency declaration, such as ... whether a military project in their home state would be affected. \u2018I\u2019m not aware that anybody has seen it yet,\u2019 said Sen.

Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.) blasted him with an air horn. Darryl Fears reports: \u201cAs committee members engaged in a predictable debate along typical party lines \u2014 Republicans in support of testing and President Trump\u2019s energy agenda, Democrats against it \u2014 Cunningham reached for the air horn, put his finger on the button and turned to [the official Chris] Oliver. \u2018It\u2019s fair to say seismic air gun blasting is extremely loud and disruptive ... is that correct?\u2019 the congressman asked. \u2018I don\u2019t know exactly how loud it is. I actually never experienced it myself,\u2019 Oliver replied. So Cunningham gave Oliver a taste of the 120-decibel horn. \u2026 \u2018Was that disruptive?\u2019 Cunningham asked. \u2018It was irritating, but I didn\u2019t find it too disruptive,\u2019 Oliver said.\u201d -- Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) has immediately become a central figure in the debate over how to combat military sexual assault after disclosing her own rape and arguing that such cases should be kept in the chain of command. Paul Sonne and Seung Min Kim report: \u201cThe military justice system gives the commanders rather than outside prosecutors the power to decide how and whether to pursue a criminal case regarding sexual assault. Critics of that setup, including [Gillibrand], say victims don\u2019t trust the chain of command to deliver justice and often fear retaliation or bias. \u2026 Previous attempts by Gillibrand to change that system were met with opposition from members of her own party, including most prominently former senator Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) \u2026 While Gillibrand intends to reintroduce her legislation, McSally showed signs on Wednesday that she would take up McCaskill\u2019s mantle.\u201d -- Eric Murphy, a 36-year-old lawyer who repeatedly led proposals to make it harder for people to vote, was confirmed by the Senate to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. From the HuffPost\u2019s Jennifer Bendery: \u201cMurphy is perhaps best known for defending Ohio\u2019s notorious voter purge law before the Supreme Court in 2018, arguing that the state should be able to drop people from its voter rolls if they don\u2019t vote for six years and don\u2019t respond to a postcard asking them to confirm their address. \u2026 Murphy is the third of three U.S. circuit court nominees who Republicans confirmed this week. All three are young, right-wing ideologues who are members of the conservative Federalist Society, which has been driving Trump\u2019s judicial selection process by funneling anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ prospective nominees to the White House.\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said that Manafort's legal team appeared to be angling for a pardon despite his lenient sentence: From a member of the New York Times editorial board: From an MSNBC host: From a former federal and state prosecutor: From an Obama-era Justice Department spokesman: A House Republican mocked how expansive the anti-hate resolution became: The former U.N. ambassador and governor of South Carolina condemned the House majority whip's controversial comments before the vote: The House speaker's daughter highlighted the Republicans who voted against the resolution: Former KKK grand wizard David Duke endorsed Rep.

But deeper than trying to shore up shaky business models or outmoded canonical standards, his anxieties speak to something even platform agnostics like Soderbergh can understand.

Oval Office tapes from Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s presidency reveal him constantly wooing media types like columnist Mary McGrory. But he became deeply embittered when most coverage turned negative late in his presidency over Vietnam and urban rioting, and he launched a sarcastic Trump-style personal attack on Walter Lippmann, a columnist who turned critical despite constant behind-the-scenes wooing by LBJ. \u2026 Trump, on the other hand, seems interested in media figures precisely because of their immersion in the daily rumpus.\u201d HOT ON THE LEFT: \u201cU.S. Cancels Journalist\u2019s Award Over Her Criticism of Trump,\u201d from Foreign Policy: \u201cJessikka Aro, a Finnish investigative journalist, has faced down death threats and harassment over her work exposing Russia\u2019s propaganda machine long before the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. In January, the U.S. State Department took notice, telling Aro she would be honored with the prestigious International Women of Courage Award, to be presented in Washington by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Weeks later, the State Department rescinded the award offer. A State Department spokesperson said it was due to a \u2018regrettable error,\u2019 but Aro and U.S. officials familiar with the internal deliberations tell a different story.

Impeachment is a messy business with potentially more downside than upside. Even if Democrats removed Trump, they\u2019d still have a President Pence. And Pelosi (D-Calif.) has a ready-made argument for why impeachment is unnecessary: The voters can simply decide all this in a 2020 campaign that has already begun. It all makes complete sense. But practical political considerations are one thing; the standard that Pelosi set for impeachment is another. In describing her opposition to it to The Post\u2019s Joe Heim, she said this: ... Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there\u2019s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don\u2019t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he\u2019s just not worth it. Shortly after Pelosi made those comments, she got some backup from two key Democratic leaders, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.). Both run committees that are spearheading the House\u2019s investigations of Trump, and both echoed her standard for impeachment as being something that needs to be bipartisan. \u201cShe laid down a number of conditions \u2014 it has got to be bipartisan, the evidence has to be overwhelming \u2014 which is what I\u2019ve been saying,\u201d Nadler told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. Added Schiff: \u201cIf the evidence isn\u2019t sufficient to win bipartisan support for this, putting the country through a failed impeachment isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d But let\u2019s think about what that means, practically speaking: It means Democrats are effectively giving the Republican Party veto power over whether Trump should be impeached. They are saying that, even if the evidence is damning in their minds, unless Republicans agree, they shouldn\u2019t move forward. Their impeachment standard isn\u2019t so much the Constitution\u2019s \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d but rather \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors that Republicans agree upon.\u201d It\u2019s theoretically possible that something would emerge \u2014 either from these House investigations, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation or the Southern District of New York \u2014 that could build that bipartisan consensus. But Trump and his allies have built a firewall against all that. They have convinced a strong majority of the Republican Party (71 percent) that Mueller\u2019s investigation is a witch hunt. The Republican Party has largely shrugged off Trump being implicated in a bona fide crime \u2014 Michael Cohen\u2019s campaign finance violations. And the idea that Republicans will be swayed by Democrat-led investigations moving forward is pretty fanciful. Impeachment, it has often been said, is a political solution to presidential wrongdoing \u2014 not a legal one. The Constitution\u2019s standard for impeachment is very much open to interpretation, because \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d isn\u2019t defined. The public didn\u2019t want to remove Bill Clinton from office, even though he committed what Kenneth Starr determined to be 11 impeachable offenses, including lying under oath and obstruction of justice. Even a proven crime by Trump \u2014 or multiple ones \u2014 may not rise to the level of impeachment. But to leave that determination concerning a Republican president up to Republicans is to effectively cede the power Democrats won in the 2018 election to hold Trump accountable. \u201cYou don\u2019t impeach Trump for him, you impeach Trump for the Constitution,\u201d argued Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), who has already introduced articles of impeachment against Trump. The backlash to Pelosi\u2019s stance has thus far been limited. But what happens if evidence emerges that looks completely damning to the Democratic base \u2014 but not to Republicans? That\u2019s when Pelosi\u2019s extremely high standard for impeachment would really be tested.","138":"Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, mulling an independent bid for president, promotes his book during a recent appearance in New York. (Johannes Eisele\/AFP\/Getty Images) With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0In Dallas last night, Howard Schultz seized on fellow billionaire Michael Bloomberg\u2019s decision not to run for president as a fresh rationale for his own likely bid. The retired Starbucks CEO cited the former New York mayor\u2019s announcement as validation for his theory that the ideological gulf between the two major parties will be so wide in 2020 that an independent candidate like him just might be able to prevail. \u201cThe Democrats are pushing an agenda that is extremely so far left that, in my mind, it's very close to a socialistic agenda,\u201d Schultz said at Southern Methodist University. \u201cYou saw today that one of the great mayors in modern history \u2026 decided not to run for president. He looked at the Democratic platform and realized that, as a centrist, he probably could not get the nomination.\u201d -- Bloomberg came close to jumping in, by all accounts, but he concluded that his path to the Democratic nomination was too narrow to be worthwhile. \u201cI believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election. But I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field,\u201d he wrote in a column for his eponymous news site. His pro-business centrism \u2013 including opposition to stricter regulations of Wall Street and a stop-and-frisk approach to criminal justice \u2013 would certainly have caused him countless headaches in his quest to become the party\u2019s standard-bearer. \u201cSome have told me that to win the Democratic nomination, I would need to change my views to match the polls,\u201d Bloomberg wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s not who I am, nor do I think it\u2019s what voters want in a leader.\u201d -- Promoting his new book, \u201cFrom the Ground Up,\u201d on the college campus that houses George W. Bush\u2019s presidential library, Schultz was asked whether he worries about being a spoiler. It\u2019s a question he\u2019s grown accustomed to over the past six weeks. \u201cI think that same question could be asked of the Democratic Party if they put up a candidate that is emblematic of a level of socialism,\u201d the 65-year-old said. \u201cI think it's better than 50-50 odds that President Trump would get reelected. I don't think the American people want to embrace an economic environment in which socialism is going to rule the day.\u201d The crowd of about 1,000 people, including many students, applauded. \u201cHowever, however, however,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe other side of that is I do not believe that President Trump should be reelected. In fact, I believe he should be fired. My view is that there are millions of lifelong Republicans \u2013 based on the president's character and leadership qualities, or lack thereof \u2013 who would not go into the voting booth and vote for a Democrat resembling a socialist but might, just might, have an interest in a person who is independent and who is not beholden to either party.\u201d -- To make the case that his bid would not just peel votes from the Democratic nominee, Schultz promised he\u2019d aggressively compete for Texas \u2013 a state no Democrat has carried in a presidential election since Jimmy Carter. \u201cI think it's fair to say that if President Trump does not win the state of Texas, it's highly, highly unlikely that he could be reelected and get to 270\u201d electoral votes, Schultz said. \u201cTexas, for the first time perhaps since 1976, is a state where everyone's vote and everyone's voice would matter.\u201d He noted that his team has laid the groundwork so that his name can appear on the ballot in all 50 states. \u201cYou certainly have a great history here with Ross Perot,\u201d Schultz said, referring to the Dallas billionaire who ran for president in 1992 and 1996. \u201cFor the last 30-plus years in presidential politics \u2026 only eight to 10 battleground states really define the election. If I decide to run for president, all 50 states for the first time since Ross Perot will matter.\u201d Michael Bloomberg sits next to Joe Biden at John McCain's funeral last September at Washington National Cathedral. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais\/AP) -- Bloomberg bowed out yesterday with a plea for his adopted party not to lurch too far to the left. \u201cIt\u2019s essential that we nominate a Democrat who will be in the strongest position to defeat Donald Trump and bring our country back together,\u201d the 77-year-old wrote. \u201cWe cannot allow the primary process to drag the party to an extreme that would diminish our chances in the general election and translate into \u2018Four More Years.\u2019\u201d -- Joe Biden also loomed large in his thinking, and the former vice president\u2019s expected entry into the race was a key factor in Bloomberg\u2019s decision to sit it out. \u201cBloomberg\u2019s advisers concluded that he appealed to a similar set of primary voters,\u201d Michael Scherer reports from New York. Bloomberg\u2019s top domestic policy adviser, Bruce Reed, was formerly Biden\u2019s chief of staff. Biden\u2019s recent struggles to accommodate the restive liberal base of the Democratic Party reflect in miniature the challenges Bloomberg also would have faced. Under pressure from angry LGBT activists, the former vice president apologized last week after offhandedly saying that Vice President Pence is a decent guy. It foreshadowed the pressure moderates will face to pass new litmus tests that did not previously exist. Schultz didn\u2019t mention Pence, but he went out of his way at SMU to say how many Republicans he admires. \u201cI think there\u2019s great people on both sides of the aisle,\u201d he said last night. -- Running in the Democratic primary as a billionaire \u2013 something Biden doesn\u2019t have to worry about \u2013 would unquestionably be a liability in the current climate. Billionaire Tom Steyer, who is much more liberal than Bloomberg, opted not to run in January partly because he saw polling that showed his hedge fund background and wealth would dog him. Several of the Democratic candidates have made the corrosive influence of big money a centerpiece of their campaigns, especially Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. \u201cHe\u2019s old. He\u2019s white. He\u2019s a man. He\u2019s a billionaire. He\u2019s of Wall Street,\u201d a Bloomberg confidante who was involved in his deliberations told Politico last night. \u201cHow many strikes against him did he need? Mike Bloomberg wants to make a difference, not a spectacle.\u201d -- Being a billionaire still might hurt Schultz\u2019s independent bid, as well. He\u2019s trying to appeal to people who don\u2019t like Trump as a billionaire businessman with no prior governing experience. Schultz said he\u2019s focused on helping people living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to pay rising premiums for health insurance and burdened by college debt. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t agree with it, I understand why people are pushing a socialist agenda because there\u2019s a level of inequality in America that needs to be addressed,\u201d he said. Schultz noted that his first engagement with politics was attending a rally for John F. Kennedy with his mother in 1960. After JFK\u2019s assassination, he said Bobby Kennedy became his hero. \u201cI recently retraced his steps in the Appalachia mountains,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cI wanted to see what he saw. What I was really crushed by \u2013 crushed! \u2013 is that \u2026 nothing has changed. \u2026 The government of the United States of America has a moral obligation to solve these complex problems.\u201d David Schwartz\u00a0of Bellevue, Wash., joins a protest outside a book-promotion event held by Howard Schultz on Jan. 31. (Ted S. Warren\/AP) -- When Schultz first publicly expressed interest in running, Bloomberg acknowledged that he too considered independent bids in 2008 and 2016 but concluded that they didn\u2019t make sense. \u201cIn 2020, the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up reelecting the president,\u201d Bloomberg said in late January. \u201cGiven the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there is no way an independent can win. That is truer today than ever before.\u201d -- Schultz said he\u2019s faced more blowback than he anticipated when he first dipped his toe in the water, but he chalked it up to a Democratic establishment that\u2019s desperate to preserve its power. \u201cWe expected that we would get a level of pushback, perhaps not to the degree that it\u2019s occurred,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm threatening to some people.\u201d -- Tuesday was the first of five full days for Schultz in Texas, a swing that\u2019s designed to illustrate how he would not just pull votes from the Democratic nominee. He\u2019s giving a speech in Houston tonight at Rice University\u2019s James Baker Institute, named for George H.W. Bush\u2019s secretary of state. Tomorrow he hosts a veterans-focused town hall in San Antonio. He\u2019ll hold a roundtable discussion with women in Austin on Friday and stick around Saturday for the South by Southwest festival. Several Democratic presidential candidates will also appear this weekend, including Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg. -- A University of Texas-Texas Tribune poll published yesterday pegged Trump\u2019s approval rating at 49 percent among registered voters in the Lone Star State. Asked about 2020, 45 percent of respondents said they would \u201cdefinitely vote for someone else,\u201d while 39 percent said they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d vote to reelect Trump. Another 10 percent said they\u2019ll \u201cprobably\u201d vote for Trump, and 6 percent said they\u2019ll \u201cprobably\u201d vote for someone else. If you add in the leaners, that indicates Texas really could be in play. Bolstering Schultz\u2019s argument to some degree, only 24 percent of independents in the poll said they\u2019ll definitely vote for Trump, while 42 percent said they\u2019ll definitely vote against him. Among independent Texans, only 17 percent have favorable impressions of the Republican Party and 14 percent have favorable views of the Democratic Party. -- Two Democrats from Texas are also expected to run for president:\u00a0Former San Antonio mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro is already in the race, and former El Paso congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke is expected to announce soon. O\u2019Rourke lost by only 2.6 percentage points to Sen. Ted Cruz (R) last November. He\u2019s viewed favorably by 43 percent and unfavorably by 45 percent statewide. Even though Castro was HUD secretary, he\u2019s relatively unknown in his home state: 42 percent said they don\u2019t have any opinion of him, while 26 percent view him positively and 32 percent see him negatively. -- As he said he won\u2019t join the crowded field, Bloomberg pledged to stay engaged through 2020. After spending more than $100 million boosting Democrats in the midterms, advisers say he\u2019ll spend even more next year to defeat Trump, register new voters and mobilize people in swing states who stayed home in 2016. The former mayor will also focus on issues dear to his heart, especially gun violence and climate change. \u201cBloomberg has drafted, with former Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope, a preliminary policy proposal for what he considers a more achievable climate change plan than the Green New Deal, the proposal promoted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), which he believes cannot pass Congress,\u201d Scherer reports. \u201cPope said that Bloomberg intended to be \u2018the person who writes the playbook.\u2019 \u2026 Bloomberg plans to increase his investment in a philanthropic effort called Beyond Coal, which has worked to shutter coal-fired power plants in recent years, and to launch a new effort called Beyond Carbon, with the goal of largely eliminating the use of gas, oil and coal in the United States by 2050.\u201d When he took himself out of the running, Steyer likewise pledged to spend at least $40 million on his effort to impeach Trump and even more on his environmental activism. -- Forbes magazine published its annual list yesterday of the richest people in the world. Bloomberg is No. 9 with a net worth of $55.5 billion. Schultz is No. 617 with $3.6 billion. Trump is No. 715 with $3.1 billion. -- Unlike Trump, both Bloomberg and Schultz are self-made billionaires. Schultz grew up in public housing and said Jewish Family Services would regularly drop off food so that he wouldn\u2019t go hungry. He transformed Starbucks from a small Seattle chain into a global powerhouse with 30,000 stores in 77 countries. -- Also like Bloomberg, Schultz doesn\u2019t pretend to be an everyman. He said last night that his go-to order at Starbucks is a doppio espresso macchiato in the mornings and a French press of aged Sumatra during the day. He told the crowd that he diligently reads the print editions of three newspapers every morning: the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times. \u201cI don\u2019t watch a lot of TV,\u201d Schultz added. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not reading Twitter, especially given what they\u2019re saying about me.\u201d -- When a student asked whom he most admires, Schultz named Oprah Winfrey and Pope Francis. \u201cI was fortunate enough over the last few years to really get to know Oprah,\u201d he said. Schultz pointed out at the Methodist school that he is Jewish, but he said watching a video of the Catholic pope humbly \u201cwash the feet of a peasant woman\u201d moved him deeply. \u201cI would like to say there are people I admire currently in government, but I can\u2019t name too many,\u201d he said.

After both refused, Trump granted them their security clearances.\u201d\u00a0The reporting further challenges the first daughter\u2019s denials to ABC News last month that the president had \u201cno involvement\u201d\u00a0with her or Kushner\u2019s clearances. -- Stonewalling, the White House formally rebuffed a request by House Democrats for documents pertaining to its security clearance process. This increases the chances of a subpoena.\u00a0\u201cIn a letter to House Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), White House Counsel Pat A. Cipollone said the committee request for the information was \u2018without legal support, clearly premature, and suggests a breach of the constitutionally required accommodation process,\u201d\u2019 Rachael Bade reports.

Scott Applewhite\/AP) FRESH FALLOUT FROM MICHAEL COHEN\u2019S TESTIMONY: -- New York state regulators subpoenaed documents from the Trump Organization\u2019s insurance broker, Aon PLC, after the president's former attorney testified last week that the president exaggerated\u00a0his wealth to insurance companies. David A. Fahrenthold reports: \u201cA spokeswoman for Aon PLC, Trump\u2019s London-based broker, confirmed Tuesday that her company had received a subpoena from New York\u2019s Department of Financial Service. \u2026 That department can refer cases of insurance fraud to other agencies for prosecution. ... The scope of the inquiry and the department\u2019s focus is unclear.\u201d -- Cohen has claimed in private conversations that Trump\u2019s representatives raised with him the possibility of a pardon, but the president's allies insist it was Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Stephen Ryan, who broached the issue. Matt Zapotosky, Tom Hamburger and Philip Rucker report: \u201cLawmakers are interested in exploring whether Cohen was offered a bargain tying his cooperation with law enforcement to a pardon \u2014 which could be illegal. ... A person familiar with the matter characterized the discussions about pardons involving Cohen \u2014 and Cohen\u2019s memory of them \u2014 as nebulous. Cohen has not alleged that he was offered an explicit quid pro quo that would tie a pardon to his cooperation with law enforcement, the person said. The person said Cohen felt that Trump\u2019s team was using innuendo and suggestion to imply there would be a benefit for his loyalty. \" -- Cohen testified that Trump ordered him to threaten his high school, colleges\u00a0and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores.\u00a0Marc\u00a0Fisher has an incredible\u00a0story on how the president's high school transcript was hidden:\u00a0\u201cIn 2011, days after [Trump] challenged President Barack Obama\u00a0to \u2018show his records\u2019 to prove that he hadn\u2019t been a \u2018terrible student,\u2019 the headmaster at New York Military Academy got an order from his boss: Find Trump\u2019s academic records and help bury them. The superintendent of the private school \u2018came to me in a panic because he had been accosted by prominent, wealthy alumni of the school who were Mr. Trump\u2019s friends\u2019 and who wanted to keep his records secret, recalled Evan Jones, the headmaster at the time. \u2018He said, \u201cYou need to go grab that record and deliver it to me because I need to deliver it to them.\u201d\u2019\u00a0The superintendent, Jeffrey Coverdale, confirmed Monday that members of the school\u2019s board of trustees initially wanted him to hand over Trump\u2019s records to them, but Coverdale said he refused.\u201d\u00a0 Trump\u2019s relationship with NYMA is fraught:\u00a0In 2010, the school, then on the brink of closure because of financial problems, requested a $7 million donation from Trump, who refused. When school representatives reached out to Cohen with the same request, he \u201cdelivered the same message but in a less gracious manner. \u2018Cohen told us he would love to have enough money to buy the school so he could bulldoze it,\u2019\u201d a former classmate of Trump\u2019s said.\u00a0The academy closed in 2015 after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but it quickly reopened after a nonprofit entity led by a Chinese investor, Vincent Mo, bought it at a bankruptcy auction and said it would pay off the school\u2019s $16 million debt. -- Trump took the time to write a $35,000 hush-money check to Cohen at some point during a busy day on Oct. 18, 2017. The New York Times\u2019s Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman report: \u201cIt was one of 11 occasions that Mr. Trump or his trust cut such checks, six of which were provided this week to The New York Times. \u2026 The dates on the newly available checks shed light on the parallel lives Mr. Trump was living by this account \u2014 at once managing affairs of state while quietly paying the price of keeping his personal secrets out of the public eye. The president hosted a foreign leader in the Oval Office, then wrote a check. He haggled over legislation, then wrote a check. He traveled abroad, then wrote a check. On the same day he reportedly pressured the F.B.I. director [Jim Comey] to drop an investigation into a former aide, the president\u2019s trust issued a check to Mr. Cohen in furtherance of what federal prosecutors have called a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws at the direction of Mr. Trump.\u201d\u00a0 -- Sixty-four\u00a0percent of American voters believe Trump committed a crime before becoming president,\u00a0a new Quinnipiac poll shows.\u00a0Nearly half of Republicans say the president didn\u2019t commit any crimes before winning the election, but every other group polled believes (by wide margins) that Trump committed crimes before arriving at\u00a0the White House. U.S. voters are split 45 to 43 percent on whether the president has committed crimes since.\u00a0The majority of voters, however, believe that Congress should not begin impeachment proceedings against Trump.\u00a0Instead, 58 percent of voters say Congress has to do more to investigate Cohen\u2019s claims about the president\u2019s behavior. THE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS: -- House Democrats are expected to formally request 10 years of Trump\u2019s tax returns in the coming weeks. Damian Paletta and Erica Werner report: \u201cThe exact parameters of the request are still in flux, including whether to seek tax returns related to Trump\u2019s many business enterprises in addition to his personal returns. But Democrats led by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), along with congressional lawyers, are in the advanced stages of preparing the request. They\u2019re relying on a 1924 law that gives chairmen of House and Senate tax-writing committees broad powers to demand the tax returns of White House officials. They said they are being deliberate so as not to make a mistake that jeopardizes the investigation.\u201d -- Former senior Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo said he will not comply with requests from Congress. Rosalind S. Helderman and Rachael Bade report: \u201cCaputo told The Washington Post that he has already begun talking with four other Trump associates who received requests from the committee this week to begin a joint strategy of resisting requests for testimony. \u2018All four are reluctant to appear because they believe it\u2019s a perjury trap designed to move toward impeachment of the president,\u2019 he said.\u201d -- But Trump\u2019s friend and the chairman of the inaugural committee, Tom Barrack, said he will comply with the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s request for documents. CNBC\u2019s Brian Schwartz reports: \u201cBarrack, the founder of private equity real estate firm Colony Capital, has been asked to hand over documentation as it pertains to numerous issues involving the president, including foreign governments \u2018discussing, offering, or providing, or being solicited to discuss, offer, or provide, any present or emolument of any kind,\u2019 to Trump's inaugural committee.\u201d -- Speaking of the inauguration, the White House has repeatedly denied that Trump had any role in planning it. But some say that's not true, Bloomberg Businessweek\u2019s Caleb Melby reports: \u201cTrump registered his opinion on inaugural plans big and small, from allocation of broadcasting rights to procurement of tablecloths, according to three people familiar with the planning and the transition effort who requested anonymity to describe the decision-making process. \u2026 Barrack told staff that Trump wanted to know everything about the inauguration\u2019s finances, an admonition to keep budgets in check, two of the people said. Trump\u2019s interest in keeping tabs on spending was familiar to anyone who\u2019d worked on the campaign, according to the two sources. \u2026 Trump\u2019s involvement in inaugural planning started early. He wanted to give exclusive broadcasting rights to Fox News, with on-air talent that was broadly supportive of his candidacy, according to three people familiar with his thinking. But in a late November phone call with Trump, Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN, argued it would be a mistake to broadcast only to his most loyal supporters, these sources said.\u201d -- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) hired a veteran prosecutor who oversaw prosecutions of Russian organized crime networks during his 10 years in the office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cThe appointment of Daniel Goldman ... suggests that [Schiff] plans to scrutinize Trump\u2019s finances and foreign contacts as he investigates whether Trump colluded with foreign governments to sway the 2016 election.\u201d THE SPECIAL COUNSEL: -- Former White House lawyer Ty Cobb called special counsel Bob Mueller \u201can American hero.\u201d\u00a0\u201cHe is a very deliberate guy ... but he\u2019s also a class act. And a very justice-oriented person,\u201d Cobb told ABC News. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the investigation is a witch hunt. I wish it had happened on a quicker timetable. But it didn\u2019t.\u201d Cobb also criticized the strategy Trump and his legal team have taken since he left in May of last year, saying they have \u201cratcheted up the public\u2019s concerns about the investigation and its legitimacy.\u201d (John Wagner) -- Some elderly Trump critics say they are trying to live long enough to read the Mueller\u00a0report. NPR\u2019s Tim Mak reports: \u201cMitchell Tendler began to fade. He had outlived two implantable defibrillators and was on his third. \u2026 Doctors gave him some painkillers, and then he had a final thought. \u2018It just was quiet for a little while,\u2019 [his son] Walter Tendler recounted, \u2018and then he just sits up in bed halfway and looks at me and he goes, 'S***, I'm not going to see the Mueller report, am I?' And that was really the last coherent thing that he said.\u2019 \u2026 The story about the World War II vet's last words made its way by word of mouth to Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He tweeted it out without naming the family and was flooded by responses from Americans whose parents or grandparents had similar feelings about Mueller.\u201d -- The federal judge overseeing Roger Stone\u2019s criminal case, which was brought by Mueller,\u00a0warned that the president's longtime confidant\u00a0will be held responsible for any \u201ccosts or consequences\u201d stemming from his\u00a0book that may have violated his gag order. Spencer S. Hsu reports: \u201cThe new order by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson of Washington does not spell out consequences but bodes ill for the longtime friend of [Trump] and Republican operative, who asked the court for leeway late Friday regarding the \u2018imminent release\u2019 of a new version of his book about Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, retitled \u2018The Myth of Russian Collusion.\u2019 Jackson found that, in fact, Stone deliberately waited until after publication to disclose plans that had been underway for weeks, suggesting his defense was using her docket to gin up publicity for the book. \u2026 She ordered Stone\u2019s defense to explain by next Monday how he will come into compliance.\u201d -- Stone deleted two websites that may have run afoul of the gag order. CNBC\u2019s Dan Mangan and Kevin Breuninger report: \u201cOne, stonezone.com, was operating as of late Sunday, according to data from the internet archival service the Wayback Machine. \u2026 The other site, whoframedrogerstone.com, was operating as of Feb. 6, according to the Wayback Machine. \u2026 Another Stone website, stonecoldtruth.com, remained online Tuesday, as does stonedefensefund.com. Both of those active sites contain links for visitors to donate to his legal defense, as does Stone's active Facebook page. However, Stone has significantly changed the language on one of his remaining legal fundraising sites, apparently to comply with the gag order.\u201d -- Mueller's team disputed\u00a0Paul Manafort\u2019s claim\u00a0that he was charged with fraud only because of his relationship with the president.\u00a0Rachel Weiner reports: \u201cThe former Trump campaign chairman, who is set to be sentenced for bank and tax crimes in Alexandria federal court Thursday afternoon, made the claim in a court filing last week asking a judge for leniency. In his filing, Manafort emphasized he had spoken freely to the FBI in 2014 about his work for Russia-backed Ukrainian politicians. ... \u2018Manafort has his facts wrong: he was being investigated by prosecutors in this district and the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice prior to the May 2017 appointment of the Special Counsel,\u2019 prosecutors wrote.\" Reps.

The 46-year-old physician, millionaire and cancer survivor known for a self-assured, sometimes brash, manner lives in Westport, with his wife and three daughters \u2014\u00a09-year-old twins and a 5-year-old. \u2026 The resignation was not sought by the White House. A senior White House official said Gottlieb had spoken to [Trump], and that the president liked the FDA chief and did not want him to leave. \u2026 The resignation took some senior FDA officials by surprise, and came as Gottlieb\u2019s signature issue \u2013 youth vaping \u2013 is being reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget. The plan, detailed by Gottlieb last fall, would sharply restrict the sale of flavored e-cigarettes to curb a surge in underage vaping, which he argues could lead to a whole new generation addicted to nicotine.\u201d -- Trump is expected to nominate the U.S. attorney for D.C., Jessie Liu, as the associate attorney general, the No. 3 Justice position. Devlin Barrett and Spencer S.

(Daily Beast) FOLLOW THE MONEY: -- T-Mobile acknowledged in a letter to congressional Democrats that its patronage of Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel spiked after it announced its planned merger with Sprint. David A. Fahrenthold and Jonathan O'Connell report: \u201cBefore news of the megadeal between rival companies broke on April 29, 2018, the company said, only two top officials from T-Mobile had ever stayed at Trump\u2019s hotel, with one overnight stay each in August 2017. But the day after the merger\u2019s announcement, nine of T-Mobile\u2019s top executives were scheduled to check in, The Washington Post reported in January. \u2026 The company\u2019s boost in spending at the president\u2019s hotel as its megamerger is being considered by the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who say it shows that Trump is profiting from his office.\u201d -- Companies have been hesitant to cash in on Trump\u2019s mentions of them, reflecting how divisive the president can be for a corporate brand. Toluse Olorunnipa reports: \u201cThe companies behind some of the president\u2019s favorite products, including Sharpies, Big Macs and Diet Cokes, have kept him at arm\u2019s length, even as he has lavished them with public praise and highlighted their products in the White House. \u2026 In the past, consumer brands have been eager to highlight their proximity to presidents, whose endorsements are especially significant because they are presumed to have access to the best products, said Nick Powills, CEO and chief brand strategist of Chicago-based No Limit Agency. \u2026 Today, even businesses that once sought out the\u00a0Trump brand have acted to distance themselves from a president who is opposed by more than half the country in opinion polls.\u201d THE IMMIGRATION WARS: -- The White House is privately appealing to Republican senators to stand with Trump on his border wall plans as many GOP lawmakers are still deciding whether to back the president\u2019s emergency declaration.

Nick Miroff reports: \u201cLast month, the shortest of the year, was the busiest February at the border since 2007, officials said, with authorities detaining 76,103 migrants, up from 58,207 in January. The percentage of migrants who arrived as part of a family group also reached a new peak, with 40,325 parents and children taken into custody, a 67 percent leap from the previous month.\u201dThe growing numbers present a legal and medical challenge for the Department of Homeland Security, which is\u00a0facing a backlog of more than 800,000\u00a0cases in immigration courts and must provide medical care to families detained at the border. -- Immigration officials released 12 babies from ICE custody after complaints from advocacy organizations.

The status of the remaining four babies is unclear. \u2026 It's not clear why the number of detained babies spiked last week. Prior to their arrival, ICE had an \u2018unspoken rule\u2019 that mothers with young babies seeking asylum would bypass the usual detainment process,\u201d said Katy Murdza, the advocacy coordinator at the American Immigration Council's Dilley Pro Bono Project.

He then called for a spending freeze on Social Security in order to reduce the deficits that tax law helped to create. \u2026 The 1996 welfare reform vote divided the party \u2015 23 Senate Democrats voted against it and 23 voted for it, including Biden. \u2026 Biden also spent roughly a decade pursuing an overhaul of American bankruptcy law to discourage debt-strapped households from discharging their financial obligations in court.\u201d -- Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said she would decide her next political steps in the next month.

People have already taken to social media, using the hashtag #GOPTaxScam, to vent their anger. Many blame President Trump and the Republicans for shrinking refunds. Some on Twitter even said they wouldn\u2019t vote for Trump again after seeing their refunds slashed. The uproar follows the passage of a major overhaul to the tax code in December 2017, which was enacted with only Republican votes and is considered the biggest legislative achievement of Trump\u2019s first year. While the vast majority of Americans received a tax cut in 2018, refunds are a different matter. Some refunds have decreased because of changes in the law, such as a new limit on property and local income tax deductions, and some have decreased because of how the IRS has altered withholding in paychecks. John Prugh of Ewing Township, N.J., was irate when he completed his 2018 tax return this month and discovered his refund would be $3,000 less than what he received last year. Prugh considers himself \u201csolidly middle class.\u201d The 39-year-old is a manager at a Barnes & Noble bookstore, and his wife works for the state government. They have two children. Prugh said he had no reason to believe their tax situation would change this year because he and his wife have lived in the same house for years while their incomes have remained stable. \u201cIt totally feels like a scam,\u201d said Prugh, who did not vote for Trump. \u201cI did still get a small refund, but compared to what I was expecting from previous years, it was a shock.\u201d The average tax refund check is down 8 percent ($170) this year compared to last, the IRS reported Friday, and the number of people receiving a refund so far has dropped by almost a quarter. An IRS spokesman cautioned not to read too much into early data because it reflects only returns processed through Feb. 1, and the partial government shutdown caused delays in processing filings. Early data can shift a lot, tax experts say, but there\u2019s reason to believe frustrations could rise as more Americans complete their tax returns. The Government Accountability Office warned last summer that the number of tax filers who receive refunds was likely to drop for the 2018 tax year, while the number of filers who owe money would rise. The GAO pointed to an IRS estimate that about 4.6 million fewer filers would receive refunds this tax filing season. Another 4.6 million filers were likely to owe money who had not had that experience in the past. There is no estimate for how many people could still receive a refund but a smaller one than before. Many Americans may confuse their meager refunds as a sign that they paid more in taxes as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Generally, that is not true. According to the Tax Policy Center, 80 percent of filers received a tax cut, and about 5 percent wound up paying more in federal income taxes. The tax cuts showed up in fatter weekly or biweekly paychecks for most Americans, but few people noticed, according to polling. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between taxes and your refund,\u201d said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute. \u201cPeople generally got a piece of their tax cut last year gradually in the form of lower withholding on their paychecks.\u201d Many families received a tax cut, but their refunds are smaller this year because the IRS made major changes to the \u201cwithholding tables\u201d \u2014 the amount the federal government recommends taking out of your paycheck for federal income taxes \u2014 in the new tax law. The IRS attempted to set withholding levels so that more people would pay correct taxes, meaning they neither owe anything to the IRS at the end of the year nor receive a refund. \u201cGetting a tax refund means that you gave the government an interest-free loan because you overpaid your taxes,\u201d said Nicole Kaeding, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. Many Americans prefer refunds, even though personal finance experts say it\u2019s not a wise idea to get one. \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery why taxpayers seem to be comfortable \u2014 and even happy \u2014 with getting refund checks,\u201d Rosenberg said. The IRS encouraged Americans to review their withholding level last year, but few did. About 75 percent of filers received refunds in recent years. Many Americans appear to like getting a refund because they feel that if they received an extra $20 to $40 a week, they would spend it. But when they get a one-time refund of $1,000 to $2,000, they put it toward paying off credit card debt, paying down a mortgage or saving for retirement. \u201cI am really frustrated with my refund this year. I was expecting good chunk of change. I was going to put it toward buying a car,\u201d said Sal Ramirez, a 20-year-old packaging designer in San Gabriel Valley, Calif. He earns $45,000 and said he received a refund last year of more than $1,200 because he puts zero withholding on his W-4 form at work. Ramirez just got his refund from the IRS, and it\u2019s only $900 this year, almost certainly because of changes to the withholding tables. He figures he\u2019ll need to save a few more months for a car. The refund situation marks the latest potential trouble for Republicans over their tax bill. They argued it would be a political victory, but it has consistently polled poorly. Ramirez, who did not vote for Trump, couldn\u2019t remember whether his total tax bill went up or down. He was just focused on his refund. In New Jersey, Prugh appeared to be hit by both factors affecting refunds this year: His overall tax bill is higher, and his withholding looks to be a little lower. His family was affected by the new law\u2019s $10,000 cap on state and local taxes (i.e. property taxes and state and local income taxes). He said in the past he normally deducted about twice that amount. He also was hurt by the elimination of the option to deduct mileage for work. The higher standard deduction under the new law did not counterbalance losing other deductions. \u201cI did not vote for Trump,\u201d Prugh said. \u201cAs active as I got in the last election cycle and as active as I plan to be in 2020, this put more urgency behind it than almost any other thing that has happened.\u201d Read more: File your taxes soon \u2014 in case there\u2019s another government shutdown Republicans passed a major tax overhaul in December 2017.

Under two similar bills \u2014 one passed by the Utah state Senate on Monday and another on the floor of the state House today \u2014 Utah would ask the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for permission to do something completely new: accept the Affordable Care Act\u2019s offer of Medicaid expansion, but only for residents earning up to 100 percent of the federal poverty level, not 138 percent as envisioned by the health-care law. It\u2019s a bold and controversial move by the state\u2019s Republicans to water down, or even completely reverse, a ballot initiative accepting full Medicaid expansion that voters approved (albeit somewhat narrowly) in November. Medicaid expansion is a core way the ACA extended coverage to lower-income Americans, even though the Supreme Court later said states could opt out if they wished. \u201cIt\u2019s completely crazy and it\u2019s something voters are really angry about,\u201d said Colin Diersing, press secretary for the Fairness Project, a national group that seeks to advance welfare programs through ballot initiatives. The Utah legislation certainly hinges on a shaky assumption, as it\u2019s not at all certain that CMS will allow the state to expand Medicaid only partially. There\u2019s currently a heated debate within the agency over whether to allow partial expansion at all. CMS Administrator Seema Verma is reportedly in favor of the idea, while other officials have expressed concerns it would only motivate more GOP-led states to expand Medicaid \u2014 something many Republicans frown upon. The question cuts into a deeper issue around the Republican-led administration\u2019s approach to Medicaid, a state-federal program typically championed more by Democrats. Verma is allowing states to implement stricter requirements on the program\u2019s low-income enrollees, saying her aim is to help pull people out of poverty rather than have them rely on the program indefinitely. Her approach has highlighted stark\u00a0intraparty differences over what Medicaid should look like and how many people it should cover. As conservative health wonk Chris Jacobs wrote last month, CMS staffers have been feeling out conservatives on how they would respond were the agency to give permission for partial Medicaid expansion. Arkansas and Massachusetts have also asked the agency to go forward with partial expansion, so its decision will affect more states than just Utah. Paul Edwards, a deputy chief of staff to Utah Gov. Gary Herbert (R), told the New York Times that the governor and other state officials have been speaking with officials at the White House and CMS but that \u201cno one has put anything into writing.\u201d Utah Gov. Gary Herbert (R). (Rick Bowmer\/AP) But if CMS didn't\u00a0grant approval, Utah is poised to\u00a0either spike Medicaid expansion entirely or be forced to pay more for the new enrollees, depending on which bill Herbert might sign into law. Under the state Senate version, expansion would be canceled entirely without federal permission. Under the state House version, the state would still expand Medicaid but would cover more of the costs itself. That\u2019s because the federal government pays for 90 percent of the costs for people covered under expansion, but a much smaller share for the traditional Medicaid population. It\u2019s unclear at this point which version will win out. House lawmakers may work to amend their bill today, in hopes they could send it over to the Senate for passage and then straight on to the governor. Proponents of the effort also hope to achieve two-thirds support in both chambers because that would prohibit activists from passing a future ballot initiative undoing the state bill. The whole thing is creating a lot of uncertainty for the state\u2019s health department, which oversees the Medicaid program. The agency has been forced to follow multiple iterations of legislation as it moves through the state legislature and consider the different scenarios the bills lay out, all while preparing to implement full expansion by April 1 as required under the ballot initiative. Nathan Checketts, director of the Utah Department of Health's Medicaid division, told me he and his staff are in regular communication with CMS in preparation for full expansion. But they\u2019re also preparing to change plans quickly if needed. \u201cIt creates a lot of work on our side to be able to consider these multiple options,\u201d Checketts said. \u201cOur teams have been doing a lot of work over the last couple of months to consider these different options.\u201d AHH: The Supreme Court ruled 5-to-4 to block Louisiana from enforcing an abortion law requiring doctors to have hospital admitting privileges\u00a0that may leave\u00a0the state with a single doctor eligible to perform abortions.\u00a0Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joined the four liberal justices in granting a stay of the\u00a0lower court decision, our Post colleague Robert Barnes reports, adding the majority did not give a reason for its decision, which is customary. The law in question would require a doctor providing abortion services to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the procedure. \u201cThe court\u2019s most conservative members said they would have allowed Louisiana to begin the process of enforcing the law,\u201d Robert writes. The court found a similar Texas law unconstitutional in 2016. \u201cIn the court\u2019s 2016 decision, it said the admitting privileges requirement \u2018provides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an \u2018undue burden\u2019 on their constitutional right to do so,\u2019\u201d Robert reports. \u201cThe Whole Woman\u2019s Health decision was the court\u2019s most important one on abortion in a quarter-century.

(Jenn Ackerman for The Washington Post) OOF: Veterans are taking their own lives in parking lots of Veterans Affairs hospital facilities. The Department of Veterans Affairs says\u00a0there have been 19 suicides on VA campuses from October 2017 to November 2018, seven in parking lots, our Post colleague Emily Wax-Thibodeaux reports. \u201cWhile studies show that every suicide is highly complex \u2014 influenced by genetics, financial uncertainty, relationship loss and other factors \u2014 mental-health experts worry that veterans taking their lives on VA property has become a desperate form of protest against a system that some veterans feel hasn\u2019t helped them,\u201d Emily writes. Preventing suicides has been a top priority for the Trump administration, she reports. In a 2018 executive order, the president sought to make sure all veterans could receive mental-health services in the first year after returning from military service. A large majority \u2014 62 percent \u2014 of veterans depend on the VA hospital system, Emily adds. But that can mean dealing with the complicated bureaucracy that comes with it. Eric Caine, director of the Injury Control Research Center for Suicide Prevention at the University of Rochester, said veterans who take their own lives on VA campuses often want to send a message. Emily reports in a note left by 55-year-old Jim Turner, the most recent veteran to take his own life in a parking lot, he wrote: \u201cI bet if you look at the 22 suicides a day you will see VA screwed up in 90%.\u201d OUCH: John D. Dingell Jr., the longest-serving member of Congress in U.S. history, died at his home in Dearborn, Mich. yesterday. The Michigan Democrat was 92. \"He will be remembered for his decades of public service to the people of Southeast Michigan, his razor sharp wit, and a lifetime of dedication to improving the lives of all who walk this earth,\u201d Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), Dingell\u2019s wife and successor said in a statement. Dingell became chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee in 1981, and our Post colleague Emma Brown writes he used to define the committee's jurisdiction by pointing to a photograph of Earth taken from space. \u201cHe introduced legislation that created a Civil Rights Division in the Justice Department and became an indefatigable proponent of health-care reform, annually sponsoring the national health-care legislation that his father introduced in 1943,\u201d Emma writes. \u201cHe presided over the House when Medicare was passed in 1965, and lent the gavel he had used that day to then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who used it when the House passed the 2010 health-care overhaul.\u201d \u2014 President Trump received a standing ovation from religious leaders at the National Prayer Breakfast after he declared: \u201cAll children, born and unborn, are made in the holy image of God.\u201d \u201cEvery life is sacred, and every soul is a precious gift from heaven,\u201d Trump added. The remarks follow his comments during his State of the Union speech\u00a0criticizing recent legislative efforts in New York and Virginia to loosen restrictions on the procedure. The comments \u201chighlighted discomfort around the topic, including among some of the president\u2019s Democratic political adversaries,\u201d our\u00a0Post colleague Anne Gearan reports. But the president did not refer specifically to his SOTU remarks at the prayer breakfast,\u00a0she adds. \u00a0\"I will never let you down,\" Trump told the audience. \"As president I\u00a0will always cherish, honor and protect the believers who uplift our communities and sustain our nation.\u201d \u2014 Democratic lawmakers announced a bill that would authorize Medicare to negotiate drug prices and would take patent exclusivity away from drugmakers if\u00a0 companies refuse to negotiate. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) introduced the bill. Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Reps. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) are original co-sponsors of Senate and House versions of the legislation.\u00a0 \u201cWe know the power of the drug industry,\u201d Brown said at a news conference. \u201cWe know the White House looks like a retreat for pharmaceutical executives.\u201d But he said the bill would help lower drug prices for 45 million Americans \u201cbecause either drug companies play ball with the former CEO, the secretary of HHS \u2026 or we have a free-market alternative. It works for consumers, it works to make the drug industry actually more competitive.\u201d Doggett said in a statement that lawmakers were calling on \u201cPresident Trump to follow the advice of Candidate Trump,\u201d referring to Trump\u2019s previous support during his campaign for the government to negotiate lower drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries. The bill will face an uphill climb in the Republican-controlled Senate. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley\u00a0(R-Iowa) has expressed opposition to the government negotiating directly with drug companies. \"I don't want to mess with the government negotiating prices with the private sector,\" Grassley told reporters last month. \u2014 A\u00a0Health and Human Services official told members of Congress yesterday that\u00a0he warned three Trump officials about the potential health risks related to separating migrant children from their families at the U.S. border with Mexico.\u00a0During\u00a0testimony before the\u00a0House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee, career public health official Cmdr.\u00a0Jonathan White also said\u00a0no one at HHS would have ever supported such a policy. \"I do not believe that separation of children from their parents is in the best interest of the child,\" he said. \u201cNeither I nor any career person in (the Office of Refugee Resettlement) would ever have supported such a policy proposal.\u201d During the hearing, Democrats\u00a0grilled HHS officials on how many children were separated and how the agency was involved in the Trump administration's \"zero tolerancy\" policy.\u00a0 \u201cWe need to know what role HHS leaders played in formulating this policy, whether they made any effort to stop it and whether they raised any concerns about the harm it would do to the children who were separated,\" said subcommittee Chairwoman Diana DeGette (D-Colo). \"There is no evidence that HHS ever tried to stop this abhorrent policy,\u201d Xarelto, a popular blood thinner from Johnson & Johnson. (Janssen Pharmaceuticals\/AP) \u2014 Johnson & Johnson will be the first drugmaker to share the list price of its prescription drugs in television ads. The pharmaceutical company announced it will start with a commercial on its popular blood thinner, Xarelto, the Associated Press\u2019s Linda A.

The study published in the American Journal of Public Health found before the ACA went into effect, 65.5 percent of people in debt cited medical concerns contributing to bankruptcy, compared with 67.5 percent in the three years after the health care law was implemented. It found 530,000 families deal with bankruptcies related to illness or medical bills. Bankruptcy debtors said medical bills contributed to 58.5 percent of bankruptcies and income loss related to illness contributed to 44.3 percent of bankruptcies, the study found. \u201cThe ACA was a step forward, but 29 million remain uncovered, and the epidemic of under-insurance is out of control,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, a physician\u00a0and professor at CUNY\u2019s Hunter College. She called for a move toward a single-payer health care system that \u201cassures first-dollar coverage for everyone.\u201d Mounting scandals rock Virginia's Democratic Party:","143":"THE PROGNOSIS Partisan divisions could stymie\u00a0hopes of improving Obamacare or cracking down on high prescription drug prices. But there is a bipartisan effort underway in Congress to protect Americans who get surprise medical bills after an emergency department visit or a hospital stay. Democratic and Republican senators plan to propose legislation this month that would extend\u00a0protections to ensure patients with health insurance don\u2019t face surprise, often sizable medical bills after going to the hospital. These types of charges originate when a patient unexpectedly receives care from a doctor who is outside their plan\u2019s network \u2014 typically in an emergency department or over the course of an in-network hospital stay. The legislation \u2014 spearheaded by Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) \u2014 represents the culmination of two\u00a0efforts last fall to seek ways to mitigate surprise medical bills for people with coverage through their employers. Cassidy, along with Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.), released draft legislation in September. In October, Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) introduced similar legislation. Even when patients carefully select a hospital that is in network with their insurance plan \u2014 to pay lower in-network rates \u2014 they may still end up receiving care over a hospital\u00a0stay from a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist who isn't part of their insurance's coverage network. As a result, they\u2019ll receive higher bills reflecting out-of-network rates \u2014 charges that can amount to thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars. This is also a problem when patients are receiving emergency care and can\u2019t choose their physician. In a study by Yale University researchers, of more than 99 percent of emergency department visits that occurred at in-network facilities, 22 percent involved out-of-network doctors. The legislative proposals would ban insurers from charging patients higher costs after they unexpectedly see\u00a0an out-of-network provider and lay out a standard for determining how much insurers would owe providers in those situations. \u201cOur guiding principle is how do you hold the patient harmless,\u201d Cassidy told reporters last week. \u201cUnder the current system, the patient is an excuse for a business model \u2026 and the patient should be the center point.\u201d Cassidy and Bennet said they\u2019ve received more than two dozen letters from providers, insurers and other stakeholders, who they\u2019d invited to weigh in. They\u2019re working with Hassan to combine the two proposals into a single bill they hope to release by the end of March. \u201cI am pleased that we are all working together across party lines to draft a bill that will help end the absurd practice of surprise medical bills and take the patient out of the middle of these disputes,\u201d\u00a0Hassan said in a statement. The effort reflects a growing recognition that surprise medical bills are yet another consumer challenge when it comes to navigating the often-befuddling world of health insurance. In a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll, four in 10 respondents said they had a surprise bill from a doctor, hospital or lab in the past year. A number of states \u2014 including Arizona, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Oregon \u2014 have passed measures to protect consumers from these types of bills. But states can\u2019t regulate many health plans offered by large employers (called self-insured plans), so federal legislation would be needed to broadly apply the protections to the approximately 160 million Americans with employer-sponsored coverage. Unexpected medical costs top the list of concerns people have about things they might not be able to afford. Sixty-seven percent of respondents to the Kaiser\u00a0poll said they were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d worried about surprise medical bills, compared to just 41 percent who said they worried about affording their rent or mortgage. Stories about patients facing shockingly huge, unexpected medical bills have gone viral. In one case,\u00a0a Texas man with an Aetna insurance plan was billed\u00a0$108,951\u00a0for a four-day stay at an out-of-network hospital following a heart attack. In another case, a woman was charged $17,850 for a urine test because it was evaluated at a lab outside\u00a0her insurance network. President Trump recently addressed the situation at a January roundtable on health-care costs. \u201cPatients should know .\u2009.\u2009. the real price and what\u2019s going on with the real prices of procedures. Because they don\u2019t know,\u201d the president said. \u201cThey go in, they have a procedure, and then all of a sudden, they can\u2019t afford it. They had no idea it was so bad.\u201d It\u2019s important to understand that the legislation being worked on by Cassidy and others won\u2019t ensure patients never receive medical bills that might catch them unawares. Insurance plans often carry high deductibles people may not realize they must meet before their coverage fully kicks in. And if patients electively choose to visit a hospital or clinic that is out of network, insurers are fully within their right to charge higher cost-sharing for that care. It\u2019s the truly surprise medical bills that the lawmakers are going after \u2014 the bills patients can\u2019t avoid even after doing their due diligence. Cassidy said one of the tricky problems in writing the legislation is making sure it\u2019s fair to both insurers and doctors. That requires limiting how much physicians can charge for out-of-network care delivered under the circumstances the bill is trying to address, but also seeks to ensure\u00a0insurers\u00a0provide more generous coverage so patients don\u2019t get these kind of bills. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to come up with something which holds the patient harmless but is fair to both parties,\u201d Cassidy said. AHH: An 18-year-old who got vaccinated against the wishes of his anti-vaxx mother has been invited to speak before lawmakers who are examining what is causing outbreaks of preventable disease. Ethan Lindenberger from Ohio is set to testify Tuesday in front of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee alongside experts in the field. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to speaking in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Lindenberger said in a YouTube video over the weekend announcing his scheduled appearance. He also shared the news on Twitter: \u201cLindenberger\u2019s story has caught on amid a measles outbreak that has affected dozens of people in the United States, prompting increasing scrutiny of parents who do not get their children vaccinated,\u201d our Post colleague\u00a0Kayla Epstein writes. \u201cThe teenager said he lived for years without being vaccinated because of his mother\u2019s belief in vaccine conspiracies. So Lindenberger began to do his own homework, consulting scientific research and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u201d In the Pacific Northwest, 68 people have contracted measles amid the ongoing outbreak, according to the Associated Press. Meanwhile in the state of Washington, lawmakers want to pass a bill that would limit exemptions people could seek for vaccination requirements, but they face opposition from members of the anti-vaxx movement who believe vaccines lead to health conditions such as autism, Kayla writes.

There have been 888 people infected by the outbreak as of last week, and 557 who have died. CDC spokeswoman Kate Grusich did not confirm the plans to Stat, saying the agency doesn\u2019t confirm specific travel locations to \u201cprotect the safety of CDC staff, including leadership.\u201d The director-general of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is set to travel with Redfield, Helen reports. Last year, the agency withdrew workers from the region affected by the outbreak because of security concerns, and those concerns have continued, she adds, as \u201ctwo medical groups that were running the operations in the area decided to withdraw their personnel following attacks on Ebola treatment centers.\u201d \u201cSince this outbreak began, 168 CDC employees have been deployed to DRC, neighboring countries or to WHO headquarters, Grusich said,\u201d Helen writes. \u201cAnd other U.S.-based personnel have been working with the Congolese health ministry, providing guidance on matters such as case investigation, contact tracing, and community engagement.\u201d Heroin and drug paraphernalia at a home in Southeast Washington.

Insulin supplies are pictured in Manhattan. (REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri) \u2014 A bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration calling for a faster process for the approval of cheaper, generic insulin to help patients affected by the high cost of the life-saving treatment. \u201cTo help expedite approval in the short term of desperately needed lower-cost biosimilar or \u2018generic\u2019 insulin products, we urge FDA to quickly amend its recent guidance documents that pose unreasonable approval delays for insulin products that could help patients with diabetes,\u201d Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) wrote. \u201cWe recognize there are myriad reason for the significant insulin price increases, including limited competition, exploitation of the patent system, the opaque role of pharmacy benefit manager rebates, product improvements and variance over time, and lack of transparency,\u201d they write. \u201cHowever, it remains unacceptable that \u2014 nearly a century after insulin was first discovered \u2014 there are no approved, lower-cost insulin products that can be substituted at the pharmacy level.\u201d The lawmakers wrote the current regulatory process for approving biosimilar versions \u201cintroduces perverse incentives that could delay the introduction of low-cost insulin products into the market in the short-term, when they are needed most.\u201d \u2014The flu is still spreading throughout the United States this season.

This season, it seems to be hitting a plateau,\u201d Michelle writes. \u201cIn all, about one in every 20 doctor visits nationwide was because of flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough and a sore throat, according to a CDC weekly report known as the FluView. That\u2019s higher for this time of year than in any recent season except last year\u2019s epidemic, which killed almost 80,000 Americans.\u201d The head of the CDC\u2019s domestic influence surveillance team told Michelle the flu season could still continue for several weeks or months more.

(Zach Gibson\/Bloomberg) The partial government shutdown is over for now, but Silicon Valley companies planning initial public offerings still face uncertainty as the Securities and Exchange Commission begins to dig out of a backlog of filings. 2019 was\u00a0expected to be a banner year for technology IPOs, as household names such as\u00a0Uber, Lyft, Airbnb and Pinterest indicated they were readying themselves for public trading. Then the longest shutdown in government history ground SEC operations to a halt, preventing the agency from giving companies key feedback and approvals on their filings.\u00a0Employees and investors anxiously awaiting their paydays from these IPOs are at the mercy of the SEC, as it's generally considered\u00a0extraordinarily risky to move forward without the agency's feedback. The agency is back in action and says it\u2019s responding to the companies in the order they filed. But top lawyers tell me this situation\u00a0is unprecedented.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s lagged all deals because the SEC wasn\u2019t working,\u201d said Eric Jensen, a partner at the law firm Cooley, who works on IPOs. \u201cNo one has ever been through anything quite like this.\u201d It could only get worse if President Trump and Democrats are unable to reach a deal that would keep the government open past Feb. 15, the next government\u00a0funding lapse. Companies could see even more significant delays if the SEC closes shop again before it\u2019s able to catch up on the filings. Another shutdown could decimate consumer confidence and reverberate through the markets \u2014 creating a treacherous economic environment for companies seeking to go public. Many billion-dollar technology start-ups, often called \u201cunicorns,\u201d were trying to hit the public markets this year in a race against the threat of an economic downturn.\u00a0The U.S. economy is expected to lose $3 billion from the first shutdown, and credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Services\u00a0says if another occurs, it could have a more \"severe impact\" than the one that just ended, according to a report from\u00a0\u00a0Reuters.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the market, and that never bodes particularly well for IPOs,\u201d said David Lynn, a Morrison and Foerster partner who previously served as the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporate Finance chief counsel. Trump\u2019s comments on a potential repeat of the shutdown did little to assuage investors\u2019 concerns. He told the Wall Street Journal earlier this week that the chances of reaching an agreement to avert another shutdown were \u201cless than 50-50.\u201d Brad Svrluga, a co-founder of New York-based Primary Venture Partners, said on Twitter: As Svrluga pointed out, companies and venture capitalists are concerned that the longer they wait, market conditions could only get worse.\u00a0\u00a0Venky Ganesan, a partner at Menlo Ventures (a firm that invested in Uber), tells me venture capitals are still holding out hope they can take companies public this year -- and are proceeding as if everything is normal.\u00a0 \"There is always risk about us being in a similar situation 3 weeks from now but there is no way to handicap,\" Ganesan said. \"Best thing is to focus on the things we can control which is help our companies grow and for the companies who are ready, push them on the path to going public. \" Unicorns have for years opted to raise record-setting amounts of funding from venture capitalists rather than deal with the scrutiny and volatility of Wall Street. They carefully plotted their paths to the public markets, but they couldn't have anticipated the shutdown. If the shutdown is followed by an economic downturn, it could have serious consequences for a cohort of companies who thought 2019 was their year. \u201cIf the markets were to soften up in the next couple months or so, this could be a real problem for companies that could have gone out during this time period,\u201d said John M. Rafferty, a Morrison Foerster partner who advises companies on securities law. Absent a second shutdown or a major shift in the economy, the SEC shutdown could prove to be \u201ca blip on the radar\u201d for many companies. Lynn is optimistic that if it remains open, the SEC will be able to effectively reallocate resources and prioritize tasks to get through its backlog swiftly. But he said companies might have to get creative if a deal can't be reached, and if the country again\u00a0enters a prolonged government shutdown. Technology companies generally do not go public in January because of the way they report earnings, but some life sciences companies planning IPOs this month were exploring ways to do it without the SEC. Some companies such as Gossamer Bio considered using a workaround that involves altering language in an IPO filing that makes it automatically effective after 20 days, as the Wall Street Journal first reported. Lawyers tell me this move is risky because they could result in later regulatory challenges. The companies would also need to price their shares 20 days before trading, rather than the day before, which could be problematic if there are unanticipated economic problems during that time. Life sciences companies also tend to price more consistently than technology companies, Lynn tells me. \u201cIt might be more difficult for companies outside of life sciences to do this,\u201d Lynn said.

While veiled in secrecy, the outpost of about two dozen buildings and lookout towers illustrates how the footprint of Chinese hard power has been expanding alongside the country\u2019s swelling economic reach. Tajikistan \u2014 awash in Chinese investment \u2014 joins the list of Chinese military sites that includes Djibouti in the strategic Horn of Africa and man-made islands in the South China Sea, in the heart of Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s economic ambitions over the past seven years have brought a wave of major investment projects, from the resource-rich Caspian Sea to Cambodia\u2019s coastline. The modest facility in Tajikistan \u2014 which offers a springboard into Afghanistan\u2019s Wakhan Corridor a few miles away \u2014 has not been publicly acknowledged by any government. But its presence is rich in significance and symbolism. At a moment when the United States might consider a pact that would pull American troops out of Afghanistan, China appears to be tiptoeing into a volatile region critical to its security and its continental ambitions. Already, the retreat of old powers and arrival of the new are on display in Tajikistan, a tiny, impoverished country that served as a gateway into Afghanistan for U.S. units in the early phases of the 2001 invasion. During a recent trip along the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border, The Post saw one of the military compounds and encountered a group of uniformed Chinese troops shopping in a Tajik town, the nearest market to their base. They bore the collar insignia of a unit from Xinjiang, the Chinese territory where authorities have detained an estimated 1 million Uighurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic minority. The crackdowns against the Uighurs have been internationally condemned as a violation of human rights, but the Chinese government says they are part of a campaign to insulate its restive far west from Islamic extremism seeping in from Central Asia. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here three, four years,\u201d a soldier who gave his surname as Ma said in a brief conversation while his Chinese comrades, guided by a Tajik interpreter, bought snacks and topped up their mobile SIM cards in Murghab, a sprawl of low-rises about 85 miles north of the base. When asked whether his unit had intercepted anyone crossing from Afghanistan, Ma smiled. \u201cYou should be aware of our government\u2019s policies about secrecy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can say: It\u2019s been pretty quiet.\u201d Details about China\u2019s activities at the facilities, some of which bear the Chinese and Tajik emblems, are not made public. Also unclear are the arrangements over their funding, construction and ownership. Satellite imagery shows what appear to be two clusters of buildings, barracks and training grounds, about 10\u00a0miles apart near the mouth of the Wakhan Corridor, a narrow strip of territory in northeastern Afghanistan.\u00a0 The Post separately spoke to members of a German mountaineering expedition who said they were interrogated in 2016 by Chinese troops patrolling the Afghan corridor, near the settlement of Baza\u2019i Gonbad. Photos provided by Steffan Graupner, the expedition leader, showed Chinese mine-resistant armored vehicles and equipment embossed with the country\u2019s paramilitary logo. Taken together, the findings add weight to a growing number of reports that China, despite public denials, has been conducting security operations inside Afghanistan. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry declined to comment and directed questions to the Defense Ministry, which did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Tajikistan\u2019s Foreign Ministry said there are \u201cno People\u2019s Republic of China military bases on the territory of the Republic of Tajikistan,\u201d nor \u201cany talks whatsoever\u201d to establish one.\u00a0 Analysts say the Chinese encountered by The Post may be paramilitary units under the command of the central military leadership but technically distinct from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, China\u2019s main war-fighting force. U.S. officials say they are aware of the Chinese deployment but do not have a clear understanding of its operations. They say they do not object to the Chinese presence because the United States also believes that a porous \u00adAfghan-Tajik border could pose a security risk. China\u2019s encroachment into Afghanistan is \u201cfascinating but not surprising \u2014 and should be welcomed by Washington,\u201d said Ely Ratner, executive vice president at the Center for a New American Security, who was a deputy national security adviser to then-Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cWe can and should foist more responsibility for Afghanistan on China,\u201d Ratner said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want a target on their back, but they\u2019ve been free-riding on U.S. dollars and lives for security.\u201d Despite harboring concerns about militants in Afghanistan for decades, China has been loath to be seen as siding with any party in the conflict, much less to put boots on the ground. Instead, China\u2019s state-owned companies and banks have inked infrastructure deals, mining concessions and loans across Central and South Asia, the poor and turbulent belt that makes up its backyard. Its diplomats, who have robust ties with Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Taliban, have talked up China\u2019s role as a regional peace broker \u2014 never a peacekeeper. But China\u2019s global posture is changing under Xi, who has shed the country\u2019s long-standing isolationism and spoken loftily about restoring its great-power status. People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) strategists increasingly advocate for pushing beyond the Chinese mainland with deployments that follow in the wake of the country\u2019s expanding \u201chaiwailiyi,\u201d or interests abroad, said Andrew Scobell, a Chinese security expert at the Rand Corp. \u201cChina\u2019s peaceful rise has encountered a complicated and severe situation,\u201d Maj. Li Dong wrote in a 2016 journal article as part of a PLA assessment of China\u2019s overseas military strategy. He pinpointed the Central Asian frontier as one of three top flash points along with the Korean Peninsula and the East and South China seas. China\u2019s deployments abroad lack strength and \u201cflexibility,\u201d Li wrote. \u201cChina should push the construction of its overseas military presence gradually.\u201d In 2017, China unveiled a naval base in Djibouti that gave it a foothold in the Middle East and Africa. It steadily installed infrastructure \u2014 and later, weaponry \u2014 in the contested South China Sea. A recent Pentagon report predicted a PLA base could appear soon in Pakistan \u2014 a prospect China has denied. Beijing\u2019s moves have been similarly opaque in the rugged mountains spanning Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and China: the same chessboard where czarist Russia and the British Empire vied for influence 150 years ago. There will be \u201cno Chinese military personnel of any kind on Afghan soil at any time,\u201d Col. Wu Qian, the Defense Ministry\u2019s spokesman, told reporters in August. In private, the Chinese tell a slightly different story. In late 2017, the Development Research Center, an influential think tank under China\u2019s cabinet, invited a handful of Russian researchers to its central Beijing offices. In what was billed as a private seminar, the Chinese explained why China had a security presence in Tajikistan that extended into the Afghans\u2019 Wakhan Corridor, according to Alexander Gabuev of the Carnegie Moscow Center, a Russian participant.\u00a0 The Chinese researchers took pains to describe the outpost as built for training and logistical purposes \u2014 not a military occupation. They also sought to gauge Russia\u2019s reaction with questions: How would Moscow view China\u2019s move into its traditional sphere of influence? Would it be more palatable if China deployed private mercenaries instead of uniformed men? \u201cThey wanted to know what Russia\u2019s red lines were,\u201d said Gabuev, who has held similar conversations with scholars working under the Chinese intelligence agency. \u201cThey don\u2019t want Russia blindsided.\u201d In the 1990s, a Uighur separatist group, calling itself the East Turkestan Independence Movement, rose in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban and threatened attacks against China. Although Western officials and analysts question the ETIM\u2019s ability to carry out significant attacks, it heralded the beginning of an extremist threat facing China. Since 2014, hundreds, or most likely thousands, of Uighurs have left China for Syria, and Chinese officials, like their Western counterparts, have warned about the prospect of fighters there decamping for Central Asia as they lose territory. In 2016, the Chinese Embassy in Kyrgyzstan was targeted in a suicide bombing that Kyrgyz authorities attributed to the al-Nusra Front in Syria. To make the days-long overland journey across Tajikistan, from the capital, Dushanbe, to the remote canyon held by Chinese soldiers, is to witness a landscape altered by an even more irrepressible force than the troops: Chinese money. In the west, Chinese-built coal-fired plants loom over the skyline, providing electricity and heat to the capital\u2019s residents. In the east, Chinese-funded hospitals and schools rise from the hardscrabble countryside. In the south, Chinese-financed tracks circumvent a crucial Soviet-era railway that had been shut down by Tajikistan\u2019s neighbor, Uzbekistan. Stitching it all together are Chinese-bored tunnels and \u00adChinese-laid asphalt that cut hours off trips along the country\u2019s winding east-west highway. The projects reflect Tajikistan\u2019s strategic position in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, an ambitious infrastructure investment plan to pull the Eurasian land mass into its economic embrace. China, through a single state bank, held more than half of Tajikistan\u2019s external debt as of 2016, up from none in 2006, according to 2017 Tajik Finance Ministry data. In the soft-power stakes, the United States and Russia both appear to be losing relative ground to China, which provides scholarships for undergraduate Tajiks and military academy training for up-and-coming defense officials. Susan M. Elliott, former U.S. ambassador to Tajikistan, said China\u2019s generous aid and funding should be applauded but viewed with skepticism. In the past year, a handful of countries that have taken Chinese investments have reconsidered BRI deals amid allegations of corruption and low feasibility. \u201cIf someone\u2019s offering money to build roads and help put power lines up, it\u2019s hard to turn that down when you have no alternative,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThis is a strategic and important part of the world, and we need to continue our strong partnerships with Tajikistan and other countries in the region.\u201d In many ways, the shifting geopolitical currents play out on the windy streets of Murghab, established as an army outpost in the 1890s by Russian Cossacks.\u00a0 These days, it is Chinese troops who are dropping by in their unassuming minivans to pick up provisions. Aiperi Bainazarova, a part-time manager at the only hotel in town, said locals believed there were scores, maybe hundreds, of Chinese troops who stayed on base. They mostly come to town to buy phone credit. Sometimes they buy hundreds of kilograms of yak meat at the price of 30\u00a0somoni \u2014 about $3 \u2014 a kilo, she said. \u201cIt helps the economy,\u201d said Bainazarova, 21, an ethnic Kyrgyz who studied on a Chinese government scholarship in Shanghai. Despite the Chinese government\u2019s insistence on keeping things secret, its troops\u2019 periodic visits to Murghab\u2019s bazaar, a row of shipping containers converted into storefronts, are anything but. Safarmo Toshmamadov, a 53-year-old ethnic Pamir shopkeeper, said they have come to her for maybe three years. Some attempt a few words of Russian \u2014 although they always come accompanied by Tajik interpreters, she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think about them, and they don\u2019t bother us,\u201d Toshmamadov said, shrugging. \u201cThey buy my water and snacks. It\u2019s good.\u201d One afternoon outside Toshmamadov\u2019s store, a Post reporter saw Ma, the Chinese soldier, who was initially surprised to encounter another Chinese speaker. He spoke guardedly but affably about his deployment, which he explained was secret. \u201cYou should know our government\u2019s standard policies around revealing information,\u201d he said. \u201cSo don\u2019t tell your friends.\u201d When asked to pose for a photo together, Ma recoiled. \u201cRemember,\u201d he said, walking away. \u201cYou never saw us here.\u201d","146":"They worked to bring food to the hungry, medicine to the sick and clean water to people living in areas without it. Among the 157 people who died in the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jetliner Sunday were dozens of international aid workers hailing from several countries in Africa and around the globe. Described as dedicated and impassioned employees of nonprofit environmental, immigration and refugee organizations, they lost their lives alongside pastors, professors, ambassadors, police chiefs and respected writers and sports leaders. All were on board the Boeing 737 Max 8 jetliner when it crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, en route to Nairobi, Kenya. At least five Ethiopian nationals who worked for aid agencies died in the crash.

A family of six from Canada, African expatriates visiting families back home and tourists were also among the victims, who hailed from 35 countries. Kenya lost 32 people, more than any country. Relatives of 25 of the victims had been contacted, Transport Minister James Macharia said. \u201cThey are in shock like we are,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are grieving.\u201d Both Addis Ababa and Nairobi are major hubs for humanitarian workers, and some had been on their way to a large U.N. environmental conference set to begin Monday in Nairobi.

Bezos to determine if the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company may have violated the terms of a non-prosecution agreement struck over a hush money payment meant to help Donald Trump\u2019s chances in the 2016 election, according to people familiar with the matter. Bezos \u2014 the founder of Amazon, the world\u2019s richest man, and the owner of The Washington Post \u2014 on Thursday posted an extraordinary account accusing the Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc., of trying to extort him into issuing a public statement about the supermarket tabloid in exchange for the magazine not publishing embarrassing and sexually explicit photos of him. Bezos\u2019s post suggested that AMI\u2019s conduct, which he called \u201cextortion and blackmail,\u201d might be a violation of the non-prosecution agreement that the company signed with federal prosecutors in New York in September as part of the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into campaign finance violations by Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer. The deal requires AMI to \u201ccommit no crimes whatsoever\u201d for a period of three years; if AMI breaks the terms of the deal, it could be charged with campaign finance crimes. As part of the agreement, AMI admitted it paid former Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 before the 2016 election to silence her allegations about an affair with Trump. \u201cAssuming AMI\u2019s continued compliance with the agreement, the office has agreed not to prosecute AMI for its role in that payment,\u201d the prosecutors wrote in a letter spelling out the terms of the deal. Two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the review, said the office of the U.S. attorney in Manhattan is reviewing Bezos\u2019s accusations to determine whether AMI\u2019s conduct regarding his photographs amounts to a violation of the terms of that agreement. It\u2019s unclear how long such a review might take. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office declined to comment. American Media Inc. insisted Friday that it had not broken any laws but pledged to thoroughly investigate the extortion claims. \u201cAmerican Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos. Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him,\u201d said the statement from the board, which is chaired by AMI\u2019s chief executive, David J. Pecker. \u201cNonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary,\u201d the statement said. Bezos said Thursday that the Enquirer indicated it would publish the photos if he didn\u2019t back off an investigation of the tabloid. The battle between the business titan and the supermarket tabloid had been building since January, when the Enquirer notified Bezos that it intended to publish text messages revealing his relationship with former TV anchor Lauren Sanchez. About two days later, Bezos announced he was divorcing his wife, and the Enquirer\u2019s story appeared shortly after that announcement. Bezos also hired investigators to find out how AMI had obtained the texts. In a remarkable first-person post to the online publishing platform Medium, Bezos said AMI had recently threatened to publish salacious pictures unless he said publicly that he had no basis to suggest the Enquirer\u2019s coverage was politically motivated. To back up those accusations, Bezos shared emails he had received from one of AMI\u2019s lawyers, Jon Fine. In an email sent Wednesday, Fine wrote to offer terms of a proposed settlement \u2014 that the texts and photos would not be published as long as Bezos and his investigator issued a statement \u201caffirming that they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AM\u2019s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces, and an agreement that they will cease referring to such a possibility.\u201d Bezos also shared a letter sent a day earlier in which AMI \u201cemphatically rejects any assertion that its reporting was instigated, dictated or influenced in any manner by external forces, political or otherwise. Simply put, this was and is a news story. Yet it is our understanding that your client\u2019s representatives, including The Washington Post, continue to pursue and to disseminate these false and spurious allegations in a manner that is injurious to American Media and its executives.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if there were other messages sent by AMI, and Bezos did not publish the contents of any messages those working for him might have sent to AMI during that time period. Jay Carney, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for global corporate affairs, declined to comment Friday. Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in Chicago, said prosecutors would want to see the entire conversation between the two sides, but said AMI\u2019s demands could amount to a violation of the Hobbs Act, the federal law against extortion. \u201cYou can\u2019t use extortion to get anything of value from someone else, even if you feel that the thing you are getting is something to which you are legally entitled,\u201d Cotter said. As an example, Cotter said it would be extortion for an employee who is owed back pay to threaten to burn down his boss\u2019s house unless he is paid. Extortion is the wrongful use of force or fear \u2014 including fear of economic harm \u2014 to obtain something of value from another. Cotter said the threat in the Bezos matter could be economic harm to Bezos\u2019s business, while the thing of value demanded is a public statement absolving the Enquirer of political motives. \u201cUnder the law, it doesn\u2019t even matter whether AMI believes the statement they are using extortionate threats to obtain is true or not. Nor does it matter if the pictures are real,\u201d he said. The Bezos matter carries echoes from another long-ago FBI investigation, in which a New York Post freelance gossip writer came under scrutiny after billionaire Ron Burkle accused him of trying to extort money in exchange for gentler coverage. That 2006 case, which featured secretly recorded negotiations between the two sides, ultimately led to no charges being filed. The gossip writer accused Burkle of trying to entrap him because he was angry over what had been written. The Bezos accusations against AMI come at a vulnerable time for the firm, as the conditions of their non-prosecution agreement will last until at least September 2021. The conditions for that deal include a promise that the company will \u201ctruthfully and completely disclose all information\u201d requested by New York prosecutors. It also requires the company to make available any documents or witnesses that prosecutors request. On Friday, deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley said he was \u201cnot sure\u201d if the president is aware of Bezos\u2019s allegations. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get into a conversation about something between Jeff Bezos and a tabloid magazine,\u201d he said.","148":"Every school day, some 50 million students and 6 million adults go to nearly 100,000 public schools across the country, amounting to about 1 in 6 Americans.

Yet while research has shown that high-quality facilities have a positive effect on student achievement, and staff and teacher retention and student truancy rates, districts defer costs year after year. According to the National Council on School Facilities, the nation\u2019s PK-12 public school buildings are valued collectively at nearly $2 trillion, and the deferred investment in upkeep is estimated to be between $271 billion and $542 billion. That\u2019s more than a 2014 government report estimated. To be sure, billions have been spent in the past 25 years to improve schools. A 2016 report issued by the council, the 21st Century School Fund and the Center for Green Schools found that from 1994 to 2013, school districts \u201cworked hard\u201d to \u201coperate, maintain, modernize, and meet the enrollment growth of the nation\u2019s K\u201312 public schools.\u201d States and districts collectively spent $925 billion in 2014 dollars on maintenance and operations: daily cleaning, groundskeeping, maintenance, utilities and security of facilities. And states and districts invested $973 billion (in 2014 dollars) from capital budgets for new school construction and capital projects to improve existing schools. But the way schools are funded in this country, that report said, \u201cis inherently and persistently inequitable.\u201d The federal and state governments contribute to the operation of district schools, but local revenue provide much of it \u2014 and those are based on property taxes, meaning that wealthier communities have more to spend. State and federal funding doesn\u2019t make up for the difference. President Trump has talked about rebuilding the nation\u2019s sagging infrastructure, but it is anything but clear what such a program would look like, and whether schools would be part of it. This post looks at the problem and discusses a solution. It was written by Michael Addonizio, a professor of educational leadership and policy studies at Wayne State University and a member of Wayne State\u2019s Kaplan Collaborative for Urban Education. He served as assistant Michigan state superintendent for research and policy, and is an expert in education economics and public school finance. Addonizio has a master\u2019s of public policy degree from the University of Michigan and a PhD in economics from Michigan State University. This first appeared on the Conversation website, and The Washington Post was given permission to publish it. By Michael Addonizio  When I was asked to support a federal lawsuit that says Detroit\u2019s deteriorating schools were having a negative impact on students\u2019 ability to learn, the decision was a no-brainer. Detroit\u2019s schools are so old and raggedy that last year the city\u2019s schools chief, Nikolai Vitti, ordered the water shut off across the district due to lead and copper risks from antiquated plumbing. By mid-September, elevated levels of copper and lead were confirmed in 57 of 86 schools tested. Safe water isn\u2019t the only problem in Detroit schools. A 2018 assessment found that it would cost about $500 million to bring Detroit\u2019s schools into a state of repair \u2014 a figure that could grow to $1.4 billion if the school district waits another five years to address the problems. A school board official concluded that the district would have to \u201cpick and choose\u201d which repairs to make because there isn\u2019t enough money to make them all. Even though a federal judge tossed out the lawsuit that I supported, the judge recognized how the deteriorating state of Detroit\u2019s schools impact student learning. The central argument of the lawsuit is that children have a constitutional right to literacy, and that the state was violating that right by failing to provide enough resources for Detroit\u2019s school system. \u201cThe conditions and outcomes of Plaintiffs\u2019 schools, as alleged, are nothing short of devastating,\u201d U.S. District Judge Stephen J. Murphy III wrote. \u201cWhen a child who could be taught to read goes untaught, the child suffers a lasting injury \u2014 and so does society.\u201d But the judge found that the \u201cdeplorable and unsafe conditions\u201d that deny children access to literacy were not shown to stem from \u201cirrational\u201d decisions of the state. The case has been appealed to the U.S. 6th Circuit. Detroit\u2019s dilemma is not unique. Before I became a professor of educational leadership and policy, I served as assistant state superintendent for research and policy in the Michigan Department of Education. I know a thing or two about how poor school facilities can have an effect on student learning. One recent study, for instance, found that in schools without air conditioning, for every one Fahrenheit degree increase in school year temperature, the amount learned that year goes down by 1 percent. Crumbling schools can be found throughout the nation. These schools are disproportionately attended by low-income children of color. And it\u2019s been that way for a while. For instance, a 1996 report by the Government Accountability Office found that schools in \u201cunsatisfactory physical and environmental condition\u201d were \u201cconcentrated in central cities and serve large populations of poor or minority students.\u201d A 2014 Department of Education study found that it would cost about $197 billion to bring the nation\u2019s deteriorating public schools into good condition. The harshness of the conditions that have plagued the nation\u2019s schools was captured in a case known as Williams v. California, a class-action lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in 2000 on behalf of California\u2019s low-income students of color. \u201cThe school has no air conditioning. On hot days, classroom temperatures climb into the 90s,\u201d the lawsuit stated in reference to the grim conditions at Luther Burbank middle school in San Francisco. \u201cThe school heating system does not work well. In winter, children often wear coats, hats, and gloves during class to keep warm.\u201d A similar situation happened in Baltimore\u2019s public schools in January 2018, when the city\u2019s schools were closed after parents and educators complained that students were being exposed to frigid conditions that the local teachers union described as \u201cinhumane.\u201d A few years ago in the Yazoo County School District in Mississippi, the lights were so old at the high school that maintenance workers couldn\u2019t find replacement bulbs when the lights went out. In Philadelphia, the head of the teachers union recently described the current state of the city\u2019s schools as \u201cuntenable.\u201d \u201cFrom flaking lead paint, asbestos exposure, persistent rodent issues, the presence of mold, and even the lack of heat on bitterly cold days, educators and children in Philadelphia are learning and working in environmentally toxic facilities every day,\u201d Jerry Jordan, president of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers, wrote in a January op-ed. Indeed, miserable conditions like these are not only hard on the children. They seriously impair school districts\u2019 ability to retain their most valuable asset \u2014 their teachers. Teachers leave their jobs for a variety of reasons, but facility quality is a key factor. Addressing the infrastructure needs of America\u2019s public schools will be costly. However, continuing to ignore them would be even more costly. The educational impact of substandard facilities on students cannot be overstated. For example, at one elementary school in the Detroit \u201cright to literacy\u201d case that I supported, not a single sixth-grade student could read at a minimally proficient level. Perhaps poor facilities can\u2019t be blamed entirely for the low reading ability at this particular school \u2014 but those conditions are still a potential factor. Funding for public education, including school facilities, is primarily a state and local matter. But while most states have tried to help poor local districts with basic operating expenses \u2014 such as paying teachers and buying supplies and materials \u2014 state support for school infrastructure has been much less reliable. Local districts vary widely \u2014 usually along lines of race \u2014 in their ability to build or renovate schools. Property-poor districts, including most big city districts, are left behind. Congress now has an opportunity to address this problem. The House has begun hearings on the Rebuild America\u2019s School Act of 2019. Introduced by U.S. Rep. Robert C. \u201cBobby\u201d Scott, a Democrat from Virginia, the bill would invest $100 billion over 10 years in fixing America\u2019s public schools. Even for people who aren\u2019t convinced that federal money should be spent on fixing America\u2019s schools, there are other factors to consider when weighing the merits of the bill. For instance, the bill would create nearly 1.9 million jobs. This figure is based on an analysis that found 17,785 jobs are created for each $1 billion spent on construction. The estimate factors in an overall $107 billion investment when state and local resources are taken into account. The $100 billion investment would also stimulate property values in communities where schools would be fixed. For all those reasons and more, passage of this bill should be a no-brainer.","149":"Brexit and the second referendum This week, the British Parliament is due to hold a series of votes on Brexit \u2014 but few expect progress toward agreement. Britain is due to exit the European Union at the end of the month, but there is no sign of an agreement that could pass through Parliament before the deadline. This means politicians on all sides of the debate have been looking for a way to avoid the looming \u201chard exit,\u201d including the possibility of another referendum. The proposal for a second referendum became significantly more realistic when the Labour Party backed it in late February. Yet the politics are still difficult. Here is what is happening. There\u2019s support for a second referendum \u2014 but big problems, too Some polls show voters want a chance to vote again. However, a second referendum would be far from a panacea. Regardless whether a second vote endorsed remaining in the E.U. or an exit, it would be bitterly contested if it were close. It is not clear that opponents would see any outcome as legitimate. Another close vote to leave would not necessarily make it easier to figure out how to exit the E.U. A lot would depend on how the second vote was conducted, timed, organized and worded. Some object to a second vote on principle Brexiteers argue a second referendum is undemocratic. In 2017, Conservative and Labour members of Parliament ran for office on a promise to respect the outcome of the 2016 Brexit vote. Many would see a second referendum as a betrayal. The logic behind their position is the idea that referendums are supposed to reach a definitive decision. Although elections for representatives should be regularly repeated, giving voters opportunities to throw the bums out, popular votes should not. This would furthermore suggest a referendum on questions of national sovereignty should be binding and legitimate. The reason that such referendums are held is often because the question is too important or contested to be decided by delegates. Controversial outcomes follow from controversial questions. That elites don\u2019t like the outcome does not mean it is illegitimate. Once the sovereign status quo has been altered through a popular vote, it is uncommon for another to be organized. In some cases, there have been repeated referendums on sovereignty issues. Quebec\u2019s leader famously promised \u201c\u00c0 la prochaine fois!\u201d (until the next time!) in 1980 after losing a vote on the province\u2019s independence. Quebec did organize another vote in 1995. Puerto Rico has voted on its sovereign status five times since 1967. Votes that fail to alter the status quo may be rerun. This is often by design. Giving voters future opportunities to test whether there is still support for the Union in future referendums, for instance, is a feature of Northern Ireland\u2019s Good Friday Agreement. However, this is not the same as holding referendums until you get the right result. But some argue the Brexit referendum was illegitimate  Proponents of a second referendum argue the 2016 vote was not legitimate, that people voted without understanding the likely outcome, or both. They make a variety of different claims as to why these might be so. The Electoral Commission found that the Vote Leave campaign violated campaign finance laws. Brexit is endangering peace in Northern Ireland, a problem that received very little discussion in the run-up to the vote. Promises made by the Leave campaign haven\u2019t turned out as predicted. People voted to leave the E.U. in ignorance. Perhaps, it is only after negotiations with the E.U. on how to exit and the shape of the future relationship that U.K. voters could answer that frequently googled question: What is Brexit? From this perspective, referendums can be used to bridge a gap between complex, private negotiations and public decision-making. Peace processes and constitutional drafting often require controversial interlocking compromises that legislatures don\u2019t like to pass. If Parliament can\u2019t pass any plausible deal, a referendum on May\u2019s plan might be the only alternative to a hard exit. In peace processes, referendums held at various stages of negotiation can push the process along. While making peace with Algeria, France held popular votes on whether to negotiate and whether to accept the outcomes of talks. Under this logic, repeated referendums provide voters with the democratic ability to shape decisions and indeed change their minds as circumstances change. It would be hard to craft a new referendum There is controversy over whether the original Brexit vote was free and fair, but there would also be bitter debate over any new one. There is not enough time to hold a vote before March 29. There is not even enough time to organize a good referendum process if the E.U. granted May an extension on Article 50. Before one could start to organize a new vote, Parliament would have to pass new legislation and reach agreement on what question(s) to ask. It might be possible to include supermajority or turnout requirements for any second referendum, so that more than a simple majority would be needed to win the vote. If things went wrong, another campaign might lead to further polarization, attract foreign interference and further destabilize Britain\u2019s political parties. Even if some connect referendums like Brexit with the upsurge in populism, there is no necessary link. When direct democracy is well-managed, populism is, too, my research suggests. States like France and Italy have had long populist traditions and histories with direct democracy but are innovating new mechanisms of direct democracy while grappling with populism. In contrast, states with weaker traditions of direct democracy have experienced quicker growth in powerful populist politics. This suggests that the details of referendum organizing are important. If a second referendum is organized, campaigns aimed at increasing public understanding and a clear ballot question that will yield an unambiguous result may dampen contestation over the result, even if they are highly unlikely to eliminate it.

","150":"In this edition: Campaign cash pledges a-go-go, a bad poll for Anonymous Independent Candidate, and the reparations fight no Democrat wanted. I'm back from vacation and grateful the colleagues who filled in last week, but I'm glad I didn't have to watch Richard E. Grant lose the Oscar. This is The Trailer.  Tonight, I was so glad to talk to Beth, a small-dollar donor from Kentucky who chipped in $5. Beth told me all about why she and her son are in this fight, and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful. We\u2019re gonna build a country that lives up to its best values, and her grassroots donation is going to help make that happen. Thank you so much, Beth, and keep fighting! A post shared by  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethwarren) on Feb 25, 2019 at 8:27pm PST On Monday night, after Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)\u00a0announced that she would swear off high-dollar fundraising for her presidential campaign, her campaign tweeted a video that demonstrated why. The senator called a Kentucky-based donor named Beth Kamradt, who shook off her surprise\u00a0\u2014 \u201cOh, my God, you actually called!\u201d\u00a0\u2014 to\u00a0talk about her work on behalf of the homeless. \u201cThat's why we're in this fight,\u201d Warren said. You could be cynical about this.\u00a0Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had blown her away, on both first-day donation totals and on the total number of donors. For a few hours, instead of discussing how Sanders had raised $10 million faster than any presidential candidate in history, Washington was talking about Warren raising a new, higher standard for campaign money. And Sanders had already told supporters that he wasn't holding big fundraisers. Warren's call to Kamradt built on that; the hard-to-miss message was that the senator would be talking to ordinary people\u00a0while some, unnamed,\u00a0rival candidates kibitzed with the very rich. The night of Warren's phone call, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) was being grilled on Fox News about an upcoming\u00a0fundraiser hosted by Sally Susman, an executive at Pfizer.\u00a0 The 2020 Democrats are in an unusual place right now; to get to\u00a0a mega-costly general election, they need to win over primary voters who have grown angrier and angrier about money in politics. No party has really had to wrestle with that contradiction.\u00a0In 2007, Barack Obama matched Hillary Clinton's fundraising totals with help from wealthy bankers, to no apparent backlash. In 1968, Eugene McCarthy tapped just five megadonors to build his challenge to Lyndon Johnson, something that did not damage to his image as an insurgent. But today's Democrats, operating in the wreckage of the 2016 primaries, are considering at least half a dozen campaign money pledges\u00a0\u2014 and most candidates have agreed to them, happily.\u00a0A July 2016 poll, taken when Donald Trump was hammering Hillary Clinton as the tool of special interests, found that 78 percent of voters thought it was at least \u201csomewhat\u201d important to know how candidates were funding their campaigns. Here are the various ways Democrats are doing so, in ascending order of how much money it could cost them. No self-funding.\u00a0The easiest pledge for most candidates\u00a0to take is the one that has the least obvious appeal to voters. Warren, the first senator to enter the race, used her first high-profile interview to denounce self-funded campaigns. \u201cWe are going to link arms and we're going to [use] grass-roots funding,\u201d\u00a0she told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow. \u201cNo to the billionaires, whether they are self-funding or whether they're funding PACs.\u201d Warren, whose net worth is estimated at somewhere between $3.7 million and $10 million, has never self-funded any campaign, and would quickly go bankrupt if she tried to fund this one.\u00a0That's true for most of the Democrats running for president. And even the DNC's debate rules, which require candidates to prove \u201cgrass-roots\u201d support with at least 65,000 donors, are slanted against self-funding. (Candidates can skip that rule if they're consistently polling in the single digits, which the wealthiest candidates aren't doing right now.) But self-funders usually argue that the money gives them independence. While he held traditional donor events and raised millions from supporters, President Trump told plenty of audiences that he was self-funding his campaign. In that same\u00a02016 AP poll, 39 percent of voters said that they were more likely to support candidates who self-funded; just 7 percent said they were less likely. Pledge takers: Every\u00a0current or potential candidate\u00a0except Mike Bloomberg, who's one of the wealthiest people\u00a0in the world, and\u00a0John Delaney, who has said he'll dip into his own wealth, estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars,\u00a0to\u00a0keep his campaign running. No fossil fuel money. Look no further for an example of a pledge that doesn't cost much but is expensive when a Democrat seems to be breaking it. In 2016, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders swore off fossil fuel industry money, and the 2020 Democrats have done the same. The question: How do you define \u201cfossil fuel money\u201d?\u00a0Clinton received millions from lobbyists who had done at least some work for the industry, a point that Greenpeace used against her\u00a0\u2014 a campaign that led to a rare outburst from the candidate, after one activist confronted her\u00a0along\u00a0a rope line. \u201cI have money from people who work for fossil fuel companies,\u201d she said. \u201cI am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me.\u201d As far as the candidates are concerned, pledging no \u201cfossil fuel\u201d money means rejecting the industry's PACs. But green groups tend to call any donation from anyone affiliated with the industry a \u201cfossil fuel\u201d donation; Beto O'Rourke was shamed in 2018\u00a0and removed from a clean campaign list because he had several donors from the industry. That wasn't a sin in Texas before, but it is for Democrats now, one that draws no distinction between executives and custodians. Pledge takers: All of them, but Warren and Jay Inslee, the Washington governor who may enter the race,\u00a0have specifically signed a pledge backed by the Sunrise Movement and other green groups. No corporate PAC money.\u00a0This pledge caught fire in 2018, with dozens of successful House and Senate Democratic candidates telling voters they'd reject \u201ccorporate PACs,\u201d a pithy two-word phrase that contained so much that voters disliked. It was a relatively easy pledge to take, too; End Citizens United, a group that backed Democrats who took that pledge, estimated that swearing off the money cost candidates around 10 percent of what they might have otherwise raised. \u201cIn many cases, they can make this money up with a boost in grass-roots donors,\u201d said ECU's Adam Bozzi. \u201cIn other cases, it's worth the trust you build with voters.\u201d Taking this pledge hurts the 2020 candidates only marginally, and it doesn't stop them taking money from special-interest PACs so long as they're not directly\u00a0tied to corporate interests. Pledge takers: All of them. No super PAC. Invented after the Supreme Court's rules in the Citizens United and SpeechNow cases, super PACs became sources of endless money for the Democrats' 2012 and 2016 nominees, and for the party's candidates in House and Senate races in every election of this decade. But most 2020 Democrats are, like Sanders, swearing off. After 2018, when candidates who loudly denounced super PACs did well with small-dollar donors, Democrats have decided that the downsides of supportive outside organizations are greater than their advantages. That has put some Democrats in a tricky position. Several, such as Gillibrand and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), have made it known that they do not want super PACs set up on their behalf. But they are legally prohibited from telling organizers of those PACs what they can and can't do, leading to a\u00a0slightly Kafka-esque situation in which candidates, through the media, urge their wealthiest supporters to cool it. \u201cIt's really frustrating to me,\u201d Booker told reporters after his first 2020 campaign event in Mason City, Iowa. \u201cI don't think super PACs should be in this campaign for anybody, including Donald Trump.\u201d No high-dollar donor events or special treatment. That's the Warren pledge, which closely resembles how Sanders ran in 2020, with a twist\u00a0\u2014 no perks whatsoever for higher-dollar donors. Depending on how it's implemented, this could be the most far-reaching of any campaign money pledge. Some of Sanders's gripes about the DNC's handling of the 2016 primary dated back to a 2015 joint fundraising agreement that allowed candidates to partner with the party and collect larger individual donations. Only one candidate, Hillary Clinton, was in a position to take that deal. \u201cWho are the wealthy people Bernie was going to bring to a fundraiser?\u201d Sanders's 2016 campaign manager Jeff Weaver asked rhetorically when the deal was revealed in 2017.\u00a0 Pledge takers: Warren, though Sanders is abiding by the same basic rule. No wealthy donors. This may be the final frontier of campaign pledges, and so far, nobody has taken it. But on the left, especially after the \u201cno corporate PAC\u201d pledge took hold, some activists and writers began asking whether the wealthy still had too much influence. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to imagine lawmakers getting swayed by a pool of donors from a big bank or fracking company who give them $2,000 donations,\u201d Zaid Jilani wrote in a 2018 piece for The Intercept, focusing on Democrats who were raking it in from employees of unpopular industries. \u201cIt\u2019s less easy to imagine that if the politicians build a donor base of people throwing in relatively small amounts, that they\u2019d fall under pernicious influence.\u201d For 2020, individuals can give $2,800 per candidate for a primary limits for 2020 are $2,800 and the same amount again for the general. In every election cycle, individual donors end up becoming toxic for one reason or another; the best recent example was the late 2017 scramble by Democrats to give away donations from Harvey Weinstein. And there's no situation where a candidate wants to be talking about an individual donor; in that Fox interview, Gillibrand called Susman \u201ca dear friend who I've known for years and years, who believes in my platform,\u201d doing nothing to disarm the attacks on her \u201cpharma\u201d support. Pledge takers: Nobody. But we've got 11 months and a week to go before the Iowa caucuses, so who knows? And what comes after the primary? The next, harder question for Democrats is whether they would disarm the campaign finance system that's ready to work for the nominee, which includes a network of super PACs, a cash-starved DNC that is constantly arguing over donor purity rules, and large donors who will want Trump defeated. No candidate, so far, has said that they'd blow up that system while facing an incumbent Republican who has no problem whatsoever with high-dollar fundraisers. But for Democrats who remember Clinton suffering from the associations with her 2016 donor operation, the idea of the high ground, on an issue that a supermajority of voters say they care about, is tantalizing. 2020 general election (Wason Center, 1,001 likely voters) Democrat \u2014 48%Trump \u2014 37% Trump \u2014 34%Democrat \u2014 32%Independent \u2014 16% This is the first independent poll to repeat the results of\u00a0Howard Schultz's own polling: Most of the\u00a0voters willing to consider an independent candidate in 2020 would otherwise back a Democrat. Here, for every one Trump voter who might back an independent, there are five Democratic voters. No polling has found that an independent would be in the position to actually win the presidency, and Schultz's near-disastrous round of opening media coverage has made him one of the least-popular political figures in the country. One more caveat from The\u00a0Post's poll guru Scott Clement:\u00a0\"Voters are strategic, and those who strongly dislike Trump are likely to support the most viable candidate who is not Trump.\" Do you approve of the immigration emergency declaration? (Quinnipiac, 1,222 Texas voters) Approve \u2014 39%Disapprove \u2014 60% Neither senator from Texas has come out against the emergency declaration, but the only poll of the issue in their state puts support underwater\u00a0and support for a border wall split at 48-48. Just one age group supports the declaration\u00a0\u2014 voters over 65. One number circulating around Democrats today: A whopping 31 percent of Texas voters have no opinion of Sen. John Cornyn (R), who is up for reelection next year\u00a0and whom the party would like Beto O'Rourke to challenge. Name recognition in fast-growing states often works like this, as hundreds of thousands of new voters move in ahead of each cycle, and the incumbents who lose\u00a0\u2014 think of Florida's Bill Nelson\u00a0\u2014 can be slow to appreciate how little the recent arrivals know about them. It's Election Day, again, with millions of voters in two megacities picking leaders with very different\u00a0amounts of power. Chicago. Polls close at 7 p.m. local time in the race for mayor and city council; it's the first mayoral election here in 40 years with no incumbent or obvious front-runner. Polling and fundraising have sorted out three clear front-runners on the\u00a014-way ballot: former commerce secretary Bill Daley, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, and State Comptroller Susana Mendoza. Every serious candidate is a Democrat; the Republican-leaning Chicago Tribune has endorsed Daley. But the top two finishers will head to an April 2 runoff, unless one of them clears 50 percent of the vote. The record low for turnout, up to now, came when just\u00a0456,765 Chicagoans bothered to vote in the final reelection bid of then-Mayor Richard M. Daley (the brother of this year's candidate) 12 years ago. New York. The city will pick its next\u00a0public advocate,\u00a0an ill-defined but high-profile role that's a bit like\u00a0a local attorney general who can introduce\u00a0legislation. Seventeen candidates are on the ballot, and a simple plurality is enough to win, but there are no candidates listed as Republicans or Democrats; they had to gather signatures for their own, new ballot lines. Jumaane Williams, a city councilman who easily won the city in the 2018 primary for lieutenant governor, entered the race as a favorite; state legislator Mike Blake and former city council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, both seen as rising stars who are inevitably going to seek higher office, are seen as in the hunt, too. A win for\u00a0Eric Ulrich, the Common Sense candidate, would give Republicans their first foothold in the city since 2013; Ulrich has also said he'd use the platform to seek the mayor's office. Polls close at 9 p.m. local time. And in North Carolina .\u2009.\u2009.\u00a0We still don't have a date for the election in North Carolina's 9th District \u2014\u00a0that's pending another election board meeting \u2014\u00a0but we know that Mark Harris won't be running.

Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris stops in Ankeny, Iowa, on Saturday. (Daniel Acker\/Bloomberg) They won't admit it outright, but a lot of Democrats are scratching their heads about it. How did reparations for descendants of slaves, an issue that has been hotly debated for years and never gotten legislative momentum, crash into the 2020 storyline? One answer is that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) got asked about it on the Breakfast Club, a\u00a0radio show on which she's made several appearances,\u00a0and used the question to advance her idea of a new tax credit. Another is that\u00a0Astead W. Herndon, a New York Times reporter covering the race, posed the question to other Democrats, and they did not reject the idea of \"reparations.\" But this might be the most confusing issue of the young primary so far. In Democratic politics, the idea of reparations for slavery started with then-Rep. John Conyers's 1989 legislation to create a committee studying it. It has burbled up every few years since then, with no nationally ambitious Democrat endorsing it; it exploded again in 2014, when Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote an award-winning Atlantic essay making the case for reparations. Even that essay ended with an argument for more, well, argument, as Coates suggested that the Conyers bill should get some kind of hearing. \"No one can know what would come out of such a debate,\" he wrote. \"Perhaps no number can fully capture the multi-century plunder of black people in America. Perhaps the number is so large that it can\u2019t be imagined, let alone calculated and dispensed. But I believe that wrestling publicly with these questions matters as much as \u2014 if not more than \u2014 the specific answers that might be produced.\" How did several leading 2020 Democrats get walked into a debate over whether they may or may not support something that is nebulous even for its supporters? One reason is that the Obama years made Democrats less cautious about big ideas; after eight years of being called \"socialists\" for market-centered health-care ideas, many asked why they shouldn't just go for ideas that involve more government intervention. Another is that Harris, twice, has been asked about a politically risky topic\u00a0\u2014 before this, it was whether private insurance would still exist in a single-payer health-care system\u00a0\u2014 and embraced the most liberal framing of that topic before explaining how her own ideas would differ. Democrats are rushing to adopt big ideas, even if those ideas mean completely different things to different people. The annual Conservative Political Action Conference, which everyone ends up calling CPAC, starts tomorrow afternoon in the D.C. suburbs. Just like last year and the year before, the biggest media events will be speeches from the president and vice president; just like those years, the conference's official schedule is moving further toward the administration's own goals, with a widening eye on the 2020 reelection campaign. Thus, there'll be sitdowns with the chairwoman\u00a0of the Republican National Committee; victory tips from the NRSC and other campaign groups; and a plethora of panels attacking the new left \u2013 \"Why Anti-Zionism is a Form of Anti-Semitism and a Threat to National Security,\" \"Marketing Marxism: There's Nothing New about the Green New Deal\" and the abortion-centered \"Left for Dead: Are There No Limits to the Progressive War on Humanity?\" The more heterodox topics, mostly getting hashed out in breakout sessions, range from \"Why Conservatives Should Support Tribal Sovereignty\" to a Rick Santorum-led discussion on paid family leave. There are at least two planned panels on the \"China menace,\" including one with a focus on \"How China is Using 5G and AI to Take Over the World.\" That's the norm for CPAC\u00a0and the American Conservative Union, whose president, Matt Schlapp, is a veteran of George W. Bush's White House and\u00a0frequent TV supporter of the president. Even after a midterm that stopped the momentum of conservative legislation for the next two years, the schedule is oriented more toward what's working than\u00a0what's failed.\u00a0Schlapp's first appearance at the conference, for example, will be an interview with former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, who lost his bid for a third term but will discuss \"war stories\" in the \"fight for freedom.\" If you\u2019re looking for the next litmus test for 2020 Democrats, look to the courts. Activists in Washington and in early states are beginning to organize around a concise but radical campaign concept: adding four seats to the Supreme Court to allow a new Democratic president to create a liberal majority, enshrining and\u00a0advancing their goals. The Pack the Courts campaign, which until recently was known as the 1.21.21 Project, is publishing papers about the risk of a conservative court undermining liberal goals\u00a0and encouraging activists to get candidates on the record for court-packing. \u201cThe Supreme Court will block the entire progressive agenda, and 2020 candidates are starting to realize that they need to explain what they\u2019re going to do about that,\u201d Aaron Belkin, the group's executive director, said in the announcement. PTC's messaging is focused on \u201cdemocracy\u201d and on emphasizing decisions or looming decisions that could find the court dismantling popular legislation; its first public paper sketches out a scenario in which Washington, D.C., gets statehood\u00a0and the court overturns it, effectively wiping out two senators and a voting member of Congress. Embracing the \u201ccourt packing\u201d frame, which for many people conjures a failed effort 81 years ago to add more liberals to the court, was meant to heighten the sense of emergency. \u201cWe initially thought: Should we call this court expansion? Should we couch this in other terms? And we eventually thought, screw it, mask off,\u201d said Sean McElwee, a left-wing pollster and co-founder of the group. \u201cAbraham Lincoln added seats to the court to save the union, and I think we're working in that mold, to save the union from the increasingly radical Republican Party.\u201d \"Why Democrats are not afraid of gun control anymore,\u201d by Ronald Brownstein The short answer is \u201cpolls,\u201d but the long answer is a lot more interesting. \u201cI\u2019ve reported on Bernie Sanders for years. A free press won\u2019t give him what he wants,\u201d by Paul Heintz A looming question for the senator from Vermont is how front-runner status, which he's never had until now, will shape media coverage and decisions about what's news. This is a deep look at how he's grown frustrated for years about coverage that didn't convey\u00a0his priorities or his issues. .\u2009.\u2009. one day\u00a0until CPAC","151":"Akin to autocrats elsewhere, President Trump\u2019s tenure has been defined by corruption, nativist scare-mongering and assaults on democratic institutions, all with disturbing results. When it comes to presidential self-dealing, conflicts of interest, foreign influence-peddling (i.e., emoluments), misuse of charitable funds, self-enrichment and nepotism, Trump is in a class by himself. Adding to the investigation into campaign finance violations and state inquiries into the president\u2019s foundation, prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have begun to probe Trump\u2019s inauguration committee. The Post reports: \u201cA wide-ranging subpoena served on the inaugural committee Monday seeks an array of documents, including all information related to inaugural donors, vendors, contractors, bank accounts of the inaugural committee and any information related to foreign contributors to the committee. . . . The request for documents, first reported by ABC News, is a sign of another widening legal headache for Trump, whose business, personal charitable foundation and campaign are all under investigation by state and federal authorities.\" Perhaps we will learn more about what foreign entities (not to mention Federalist Society Executive Vice President Leonard Leo) expected for their donations. What\u2019s clear is that the inauguration committee was the beginning and not the end of transforming the Oval Office from the seat of executive power to the seat of a multi-faceted money-making machine for Trump and his family. Like right-wing nativist parties in Europe, the Republican Party has taken up anti-immigrant hysteria with a tenaciousness matched only by its dishonesty. At a time when illegal border crossings are at their lowest in decades, when U.S. cities benefit from a huge drop in violent crime and the most diverse generation in U.S. history has reached adulthood, Trump has championed white grievance. It served to lift him to the presidency and strengthen bonds with his white, less-educated and mostly male base. However, it\u2019s (sorry) hit a brick wall in the fight over his dreams of a magnificent border edifice, a lasting symbol of immigration exclusion. Trump\u2019s caravan demagoguing failed to deliver him midterm victories and, according to a raft of polling, has not swayed the electorate as a whole on the topic of a wall. (\u201cSixty percent of Americans oppose major new construction of walls along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 the goal behind President Donald Trump\u2019s budget showdown with Democratic leaders that led to a record 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government,\u201d a Gallup poll reports. Trump\u2019s anti-immigration stance more generally hasn\u2019t won many adherents either. A huge majority (81 percent) favors a path to citizenship for illegals \u201cif they meet certain requirements over a period of time\u201d while 61 percent \u201coppose deporting all illegal immigrants back to their home country.\u201d Moreover, \u201cSince Trump\u2019s election, the proportion of Americans wanting to increase immigration levels has grown \u2014 from 21% in June 2016 to a record-high 30% now.\u201d While Trumpian corruption and nativism have been met with legal and electoral opposition, his efforts to thwart democracy itself have sadly found more success and, worse, served as an inspiration to strongmen. In its latest report on declining democracy around the world, Freedom House finds: The 13 years of decline have touched all parts of the world and affected Free, Partly Free, and Not Free countries alike. Every region except Asia-Pacific has a lower average score for 2018 than it did in 2005, and even Asia declined when countries with less than 1 million people\u2014mostly small Pacific Island states\u2014are excluded. Not Free countries as a group suffered a more significant score drop than Free or Partly Free countries, which also declined. . . . The end of the Cold War facilitated a wave of democratization in the late 20th century, but a large share of countries that made progress during that time were unable to maintain it Most troubling, \u201cChallenges to American democracy are testing the stability of its constitutional system and threatening to undermine political rights and civil liberties worldwide. . . . While democracy in America remains robust by global standards, it has weakened significantly over the past eight years, and the current president\u2019s ongoing attacks on the rule of law, fact-based journalism, and other principles and norms of democracy threaten further decline.\u201d Freedom House further reports: Freedom House has tracked a slow overall decline in political rights and civil liberties in the United States for the past eight years, punctuated by an unusual three-point drop for developments in 2017. Prominent concerns have included Russian interference in US elections, domestic attempts to manipulate the electoral system, executive and legislative dysfunction, conflicts of interest and lack of transparency, and pressure on judicial independence and the rule of law. . . . The score for equal treatment before the law declined due to government policies and actions that improperly restricted the legal rights of asylum seekers, signs of discrimination in the acceptance of refugees for resettlement, and excessively harsh or haphazard immigration enforcement policies that resulted in the separation of children from adult family members, among other problematic outcomes. To put that in perspective the organization\u2019s rating for the United States (86 out of 100) puts it on a par with Belize, Croatia, Greece, Latvia, and Mongolia. In short, Trump\u2019s financial improprieties and xenophobic scare tactics are being checked, but his attacks on the foundations of our democracy have not been disabled \u2014 far from it. The midterm elections took a step in the right direction by re-establishing congressional oversight, but the erosion of the rule of law, efforts to delegitimize independent sources of information and ongoing accretion of executive power increase. It\u2019s not until he has been removed by the ballot or otherwise and repairs to the institutions of democracy are made that we should rest easy. Until then, Freedom House\u2019s admonition should guide Americans and other freedom-loving people: Those committed to human rights and democratic governance should not limit themselves to a wary defense of the status quo. Instead we should throw ourselves into projects intended to renew national and international orders, to make protections for human dignity even more just and more comprehensive, including for workers whose lives are disrupted by technological and economic change. Democracy requires continuous effort to thrive, and a constant willingness to broaden and deepen the application of its principles. The future of democracy depends on our ability to show that it is more than a set of bare-minimum defenses against the worst abuses of tyrants\u2014it is a guarantee of the freedom to choose and live out one\u2019s own destiny. We must demonstrate that the full promise of democracy can be realized, and recognize that no one else will do it for us. Bluntly put, we cannot wait until the 2020 elections to thwart Trump\u2019s assault on democracy. The effort to sow the seeds for a democratic revival should begin now.

Here\u2019s a damage report.","152":"THE PROGNOSIS (Jim Watson\/AFP\/Getty Images) A coalition formed by former Obama administration officials to fight Obamacare repeal efforts is urging House Democrats to take a pragmatic approach to\u00a0health care in the new Congress, rather than pushing for a more sweeping\u00a0plan such as Medicare-for-all. Protect Our Care says a poll it commissioned and is releasing today shows Democrats will please more voters if they focus on legislation to ease steep costs for health insurance and prescription drugs versus trying to overhaul the\u00a0insurance system. Moderates and liberal Democrats\u00a0are diverging over this very question, as they try to figure out how to wield their new powers in Congress and what agenda to lay out in the 2020 elections. The poll was conducted among 1,002 voters nationwide between Jan. 8 and 11. While Americans are curious about what a Medicare-for-all-type approach might look like, they\u2019re a lot more concerned with improving the coverage they already have, Protect Our Care leaders Leslie Dach and Brad Woodhouse wrote in a memo provided to Health 202. \u201cOur polling \u2026 shows that voters, including many Republicans and Independents, are open to a conversation about both Medicare-for-all and expanding the Affordable Care Act with significant new public options (e.g. Medicare\/Medicaid buy in),\u201d the memo says.\u00a0 \u201cHowever, when it comes to priorities for this year, voters \u2014 including progressive Democrats \u2014 clearly prioritize the agenda described above,\u201d the memo continues, referring to a list of incremental measures such as limiting surprise medical bills or requiring drug companies to justify big price hikes to the government. It looks so far like Democrats \u2014 and Republicans, for that matter \u2014 are heeding the advice from the coalition, which spent heavily in the midterm elections to pressure Republicans over their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and includes top liberal advocacy groups such as Families USA and the Center for American Progress. Two top congressional committees \u2014 House Oversight and Senate Finance \u2014 have scheduled simultaneous hearings Tuesday\u00a0on the high cost of prescription drugs. Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) have both vowed to make health-care costs a\u00a0priority this year. Both panels will include\u00a0parents of patients with Type 1 diabetes who will speak about the especially massive price hikes for insulin. Antroinette Worsham, who will testify before Oversight, had a daughter with diabetes who died after rationing her insulin because she couldn\u2019t afford the medication. \"What we're trying\u00a0to do is get some sound action and truly reduce drug prices,\" Cummings told me. There\u2019s lots of excitement among health-care advocates about these hearings, as numerous polls have shown the high cost of drugs is a top concern for American voters. In Protect Our Care\u2019s new survey, which was conducted by Democratic polling firm Hart Research, most respondents chose \u201creducing health insurance premiums\u201d and \u201ccracking down on excessive drug prices\u201d as their top two health-care priorities for the new Congress. The survey also indicated Democratic voters are more interested in shoring up existing health-care law than passing a new law. Sixty-eight percent said lawmakers should improve or expand current law to cover more people, while 29 percent said they should pass a new law such as Medicare-for-all to provide universal coverage. Dach acknowledged there\u2019s \u201ca conversation to be had\u201d around the broader goal of expanding coverage to all Americans through a massive expansion of Medicare or Medicaid. That conversation should begin, he told me, but it shouldn\u2019t distract Democrats from taking on issues right\u00a0 in front of them \u2014 especially considering that House Democrats will have to work with the GOP-led Senate and the White House to actually write any new laws. \u201cIf you want to build the political support for [Medicare-for-all], politically this is a time for conversation and education on those issues,\u201d Dach said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a time where those things are going to pass.\u00a0This is going to take time.\u201d Protect Our Care has distributed a guide to lawmakers\u00a0advising\u00a0them to become the \u201cHealth Care Congress\u201d by working on several key goals such as countering the Trump administration\u2019s moves to undermine the ACA, strengthening Medicare and Medicaid and striving to lower health-care costs. The guide suggests some policies Republicans would almost certainly balk at, such as\u00a0allowing the government to negotiate lower prices for Medicare drugs and rolling back the administration\u2019s expansion of leaner coverage options. But considering Republicans control the Senate and the White House, a key question is whether Democrats will play ball on policies that could get bipartisan support\u00a0for the purpose of getting something done. Given the\u00a0public concern about health-care costs, the issue could finally be in a sweet spot where\u00a0members of both parties find it in their political interests to tackle. \"I'll tell you I told Secretary Azar\u00a0that all of us in government,\u00a0including\u00a0 [President] Trump, need to get something done,\" Cummings said, referring to a recent meeting between him and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal workers will return to the jobs today after the president signed a bill to reopen the government for three weeks.\u00a0It may take weeks or months for operations to return to normal after the 35-day partial shutdown,\u00a0our Post colleagues Juliet Eilperin, Lisa Rein and Sarah Kaplan report. The first order of business for the furloughed\u00a0workers \"will be simple office tasks, like new passwords for computers,\u201d they write. \u201cTimecards will need filling out, so payroll staffs know who was furloughed, worked without pay, called in sick, earned overtime or a combination.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration will start accepting new drug and medical device applications, now that\u00a0the agency can resume collecting\u00a0new user fees to pay for the applications.\u00a0But officials warn\u00a0it could take up to a year to finally catch up with backlogged work, our colleague Laurie McGinley reports. \u2014 For some federal workers, their missed paychecks may have future repercussions. Scores of government employees who went without pay also struggled to make child-support payments\u00a0usually withdrawn directly from their paychecks, our Post colleague Samantha Schmidt reports. Still, even with the government at least temporarily reopening, workers may not receive a paycheck for days, Samantha writes, meaning workers and their children and former spouses who rely on child-support payments will still feel the squeeze. \u201cFamily law experts said there could be ripple effects after the shutdown for non-custodial parents who already missed a child-support payment, making them vulnerable to administrative sanctions or even contempt of court,\u201d Samantha writes. \u201cFurloughed parents obligated by the state to pay child support could face back payments and administrative sanctions for missing a child support payment during the shutdown. Depending on the state, parents could theoretically lose their driver\u2019s licenses or professional licenses. Eventually some of these cases could find their way to the court for failure to pay child support on a timely basis.\u201d But Samantha writes in some areas, officials are planning\u00a0to limit or suspend enforcement in \u201ccases in which people fall behind in payments because of the shutdown and urged federal workers to contact the local office to arrange payment plans as soon as they return to work after the shutdown.\u201d \u00a0\u2014 The\u00a0Blue Cross and Blue Shield Federal Employee Program announced it would donate $1 million to help federal employees who went unpaid during the shutdown. In addition, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, the company serving the Washington area, is pledging $1 million to the Federal Employee Education and Assistance Fund and $500,000 in donations to regional food banks and human service organizations. The donations are\u00a0meant to offer cash grants and no-interest loans to help workers who were furloughed. The D.C. Diaper Bank joins others around the country in providing diapers, wipes and feminine supply products to furloughed government workers in Washington. (Marvin Joseph\/The Washington Post) \u2014 Even with the shutdown at least temporarily over, some employees are still struggling to pay for life\u2019s basic necessities, including diapers, tampons, pads and adult incontinence products, our Post colleague Katie Zezima reports. Diapers alone can cost a family $70 to $80 a month, according to the National Diaper Bank Network. \u201cAt least 20 diaper banks across the country have provided diapers, feminine and incontinence products, formula and more to federal employees during the shutdown and in the few days since Congress and President Trump agreed to reopen the government,\u201d she writes. \u201cDiaper banks started to receive calls for help in mid-January, and the entreaties became more and more desperate the longer the shutdown went on, according to organization officials.\u201d Those calls continued even as the government is set to reopen, Katie writes, \u00a0and groups plan to\u00a0hand out products throughout the week while federal workers wait to finally get a paycheck. \u2014 Our colleagues Aaron C. Davis and Neena Satija write of contracting firm Unispec Enterprises, whose employees\u2019 health insurance remains in limbo even as federal offices reopen, an example that\u00a0\u201creflects the razor-thin profit margin and unsettled nature of business for government contracting firms and their employees.\u201d \u201cUnlike the 800,000 career federal employees who have been promised full back pay in coming days, government contractors \u2014 who are thought to number in the millions \u2014 have no legal claim to the five weeks of lost wages,\u201d they write. Federal contractor Janice Morgan, who works for Unispec, had her insurance coverage\u00a0canceled during the shutdown, and she worried when she wasn\u2019t able to fill the prescription for the $7,600- per month medication for her husband who has multiple sclerosis. Wesley McClure, Unispec\u2019s founder and president, told the Post that\u00a0before the shutdown, he hadn't missed a payroll or had to terminate insurance for his employees in 15 years. \u201cIt feels like we are still hostages,\u201d Morgan told our colleagues. \u201cI\u2019m just so happy to be going back to work and to be able to get on with our lives because I need our health insurance to fill these prescriptions. But who knows if this will all happen again in three weeks.\u201d (iStock) AHH: Politico\u2019s Sarah Karlin-Smith reports from a small hilltop village in Butaro, Rwanda, where she writes about the University of Global Health Equity that aims to be a model for equitable health care by training doctors to reach people in places without access to pricey resources and technology. Butaro is \u201clifetimes away from the bustling cities that medical schools and their students gravitate toward \u2014 and hardly seems a place that would hold lessons for rich countries awash in high-tech medicine like the United States,\u201d Sarah writes. \u201cThat\u2019s precisely why the university\u2019s founders picked Butaro. Most people in the world live in rural areas like this, eking out a living on meager sums. To bring them health care, the medical school staff here believe, you have to go where they are, immerse yourself in their lives.\u201d The program will merge public-health training with traditional medical school teachings to train health-care professionals who can care for patients properly even if they don\u2019t have water or electricity. The new university is also uniquely set in the poorest area of a nation still working to rebuild after a genocide and civil war in 1994. \u201cThe 100-day bloodbath killed about 1 million people and devastated the country's health infrastructure, leaving Rwanda with the lowest life expectancy in the world,\u201d Sarah writes. \u201cThe university embodies the global community\u2019s renewed commitment to Rwanda, after it failed to intervene against the genocide.\u201d (iStock) OOF: Some nonprofit hospitals are\u00a0looking to patients for donations, using software and interactions with patients to determine\u00a0potential large donors, Kaiser Health News\u2019s Phil Galewitz reports. The software checks to see if patients have contributed to charities or to political campaigns, and some hospitals train doctors and nurses to have patients who express\u00a0gratitude for their care contacted by hospital fundraisers. \u201cThose who seem promising targets for fundraising may receive a visit from a hospital executive in their rooms, as well as extra amenities like a bathrobe or a nicer waiting area for their families,\u201d Phil writes. And despite concerns about such programs, they are becoming more common. A 2016 survey by consulting firm Advisory Board found out of 108 hospitals, 68 had so-called \u201cgrateful patient programs.\u201d \u201cA 2013 change in federal health privacy law made it easier for hospitals to target their patients for donations,\u201d Phil writes. \u201cIt enabled hospital records departments to share with staff fundraisers some personal details of patients, including their health insurance status, the department treating them, the name of their physician and the outcome of their care.\u201d Bill Littlejohn, chief executive officer of the San Diego-based Sharp HealthCare system\u2019s fundraising foundation, told Phil the practice of having doctors speak with select patients about their experience led to 20 percent of patient donations there. OUCH: Federal\u00a0regulators\u00a0identified a cancer-causing contaminant that tainted millions of bottles of a commonly used blood pressure and heart failure drug. Agency officials have said\u00a01 to 2 million people may have taken the tainted medicines. The generic medication has been recalled by drug companies over the past seven months, our Post colleague Carolyn Y. Johnson reports. The FDA announced the contaminant in the drugs was a \u201cchemical byproduct of the process used to synthesize the active ingredient in the drugs, which include valsartan, losartan and irbesartan,\u201d Carolyn writes. Patients who took the medication may have been exposed to trace amounts of the carcinogen for at least four years,\u00a0after a shift in how the drug\u2019s active ingredient was manufactured. The FDA said the byproducts would not have been detected in routine inspections. But David Light, chief executive of Valisure, an online pharmacy that chemically validates drugs before sending them to consumers, told Carolyn: \u201cThe manufacturers know, or should have known, about the contamination. Common precision tools exist to analyze these contaminants, and there are standard procedures for getting rid of them.\u201d In a statement, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Director Janet Woodcock said the officials are \u201cmaking important strides at understanding how these impurities occurred, mitigating the risk to patients and learning what steps need to be taken to prevent this from occurring again in the future \u2026 While the total exposure to these impurities for most patients was small, we are deeply concerned that patients were exposed to this impurity in the first place and that the presence of nitrosamines went undetected for a period of time.\u201d Today Coming up Watch House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signing a bill to temporarily end the government shutdown: 'Hope for the best': Federal workers relieved but uncertain as shutdown temporarily ends:","153":"Congressional Democrats are likely to request 10 years of President Trump\u2019s tax returns in coming weeks, tailoring their inquiry in a way they hope will survive a court battle, according to lawmakers and others involved in the discussions. The exact parameters of the request are still in flux, including whether to seek tax returns related to Trump\u2019s many business enterprises in addition to his personal returns. But Democrats led by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), along with congressional lawyers, are in the advanced stages of preparing the request. They\u2019re relying on a 1924 law that gives chairmen of House and Senate tax-writing committees broad powers to demand the tax returns of White House officials. They said they are being deliberate so as not to make a mistake that jeopardizes the investigation. \u201cIf we had done this a month and a half ago, we would not be prepared, we would be falling on our face, and we\u2019d be looking at the rationale for what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.), who along with other Democrats has pushed for congressional action to get at the tax returns practically since Trump took office. \u201cWould I have liked it to go faster? I started two years ago. Yes, of course.\u201d Pascrell, a member of Neal\u2019s committee, would not give an estimate for when the inquiry could come, but he said he is advocating for a sweeping request for records, including personal and business tax filings, in search of a comprehensive view of Trump\u2019s compliance with the law. As House Democrats begin to roll out probes of the Trump administration on multiple fronts, some lawmakers say Trump\u2019s tax returns could contain information critical to many of their inquiries and, as such, could become the linchpin of their oversight responsibilities and the focus of one of the most important court fights they will wage. Trump has made clear to associates that he has no plans to allow Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to turn over his personal tax records, according to three people who have been briefed on the discussions and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, said it was premature for the president and his legal team to decide how to respond to a request for his tax returns until one is formally made. But he warned House Democrats against overreach and \u201ccreating a circus.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t say yet\u201d what the president and his lawyers would do, Giuliani said. \u201cYou face it when it becomes an issue, and that would deserve a lot of legal consideration.\u201d The 1924 law does not appear to give Mnuchin much flexibility to deny a congressional request \u2014 it says he \u201cshall\u201d turn over the records. But if he refused, Democrats would probably try to compel Mnuchin to comply by filing a lawsuit in federal court. That could drag the process out for months or more than a year, which could be one of Trump\u2019s primary legal strategies, particularly if he thinks Republicans might retake control of the House of Representatives in the 2020 elections. \u201cWhat the president will do is: He will, first of all, respond grudgingly and slowly. They will then negotiate,\u201d said former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). \u201cThey will be subpoenaed. They will take that all the way to the Supreme Court.\u201d George Yin, a former chief of staff for Congress\u2019s Joint Committee on Taxation, said there is no precedent for a treasury secretary to refuse to comply with a congressional request for tax returns, but if the matter goes to court, Democrats could be forced to prove that the inquiry is part of Congress\u2019s \u201clawmaking function or its oversight responsibilities.\u201d Congressional leaders have never used the 1924 law to seek the tax returns of a sitting U.S. president, but no president in recent history has refused to voluntarily disclose his tax returns. House Democrats included a new requirement for presidential candidates to release 10 years\u2019 worth of personal tax returns in legislation on campaign finance and government ethics that they plan to pass this week, although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has made clear he won\u2019t take up the bill. During the 2016 campaign, Trump gave a variety of reasons that he would not release his tax returns. One of the most prominent was his claim that the returns were being audited by the Internal Revenue Service and that he would release them when that process was over. He repeated that claim in November, after Democrats won the midterm elections. \u201cNobody turns over a return when it\u2019s under audit,\u201d he said during a news conference. But that characterization came into question last week, when Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, told a House committee that his understanding was that Trump didn\u2019t release his tax returns for a much different reason. \u201cWhat he didn\u2019t want is to have an entire group of think tanks that are tax experts run through his tax return and start ripping it to pieces, and then he\u2019ll end up in an audit, and he\u2019ll ultimately have taxable consequences, penalties and so on,\u201d Cohen said, adding, \u201cI presume that he is not under audit.\u201d In 2017, Mnuchin told a congressional committee that he didn\u2019t know whether Trump\u2019s tax returns were being audited, because \u201cI don\u2019t have access to that, that\u2019s within the IRS. I don\u2019t have access to specific taxpayer-level information.\u201d Steve Moore, who was an economic adviser to Trump during the 2016 campaign, said he advised Trump to \u201cnever, ever, ever, ever release his tax returns.\u201d Moore said Democrats tried to make an issue of Trump\u2019s refusal to release the returns during the campaign, but Trump\u2019s victory in the election should serve as validation that voters aren\u2019t particularly interested in what the returns say. \u201cIt would be a total abuse of power and a violation of Donald Trump\u2019s right of privacy,\u201d Moore said. Democrats have said they want to review Trump\u2019s tax returns to see whether there is evidence of conflicts of interest, inappropriate business relationships or improper influence by foreign governments. They\u2019re also looking to understand the precise impact of the 2017 tax cuts on his personal finances, as well as whether he used inappropriate or illegal tax schemes in the past. \u201cThere\u2019s always a legitimate reason to look at your president\u2019s tax returns,\u201d said Janice Mays, a managing director of PwC who spent 40 years on the House Ways and Means Committee as a Democratic aide. Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.), another member of the Ways and Means Committee, said Democrats must move as quickly as possible because he believes it will take a long time to review the tax returns once they are provided. \u201cIf the desire is to get this information and have it be properly analyzed, it\u2019s essential action be taken immediately,\u201d he said in an interview. Neal\u2019s office declined to comment. Ashley Etienne, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), said Ways and Means is consulting with other committees to make sure House lawmakers \u201cpresent the strongest possible case.\u201d But Gingrich said he believes the inquiry is part of a desperate attempt by Democrats to try to bring Trump down after previous efforts and investigations failed. He said Democrats are trying to throw the \u201ckitchen sink\u201d at the White House because they have been unable to prove that Trump colluded with the Russian government in the run-up to the 2016 election, among other things. Gingrich said that even if Democrats were able to obtain the documents, they would be required under law to keep them confidential, something he believes would prove impossible for Democrats to do. \u201cIs there anybody in Washington who believes it will not be leaked?\u201d he said. House Democrats could vote to publicly release the records, but that could force them to explain what the precise legislative purpose would be for such a move. Mnuchin has said he would review any congressional inquiry regarding tax returns but has not committed to turning over any records. He could be pressed to explain his rationale as soon as next week, though, when he\u2019s expected to testify before Neal\u2019s committee. A Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday suggested that a majority of Americans think that Trump should release his tax returns and that Congress should investigate the matter if he doesn\u2019t provide the records.","154":"Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, is scheduled to testify before three congressional committees this week \u2014 two in private and one in a potentially explosive public hearing. Cohen once proudly considered himself Trump\u2019s fixer, and there are few people closer to the president than he once was. He is expected to describe to lawmakers what he views as Trump\u2019s \u201clies, racism and cheating,\u201d both as president and in private business, and will describe \u201cpersonal, behind-the-scenes\u201d interactions he witnessed, a person familiar with the matter said. Cohen pleaded guilty last year to multiple crimes, including arranging hush-money payments to women who alleged affairs with Trump, and lying to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow. He is supposed to begin serving a three-year prison sentence in May. He will testify Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee and Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee \u2014 though only the oversight hearing is public. In a statement Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called Cohen a \u201cdisgraced felon,\u201d noting his past lies to lawmakers. \u201cSadly,\u201d the statement says, \u201che will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same. It\u2019s laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.\u201d In his testimony, Cohen is expected to detail his motives for having helped Trump and for now coming clean, the person familiar with the matter said. He will offer \u201cvery specific details\u201d \u2014 some of which have not yet been made public \u2014 about arranging the hush-money payments at Trump\u2019s direction, the person said. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to describe the expected testimony. Cohen also is expected to \u201cprovide more detail about his lies to Congress\u201d and address in some capacity a BuzzFeed News report asserting he told special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s office that the president directed him to lie, the person said. The special counsel has disputed that report, though Cohen has not said anything about it publicly. Cohen is expected to present records of Trump\u2019s finances and recall alleged instances \u201cwhere Trump used high numbers for his purposes, such as getting on the top 10 wealthiest people on the Forbes list, and low numbers, when it came time to paying real estate taxes,\u201d the person said. Cohen\u2019s allies hope he could become this generation\u2019s John Dean \u2014 President Richard Nixon\u2019s White House counsel who famously testified to the Senate about Nixon\u2019s involvement in the Watergate scandal that ultimately led him to resign. Whether Cohen\u2019s testimony will be as impactful depends on the questions he is asked, the new facts he is able to present \u2014 and the evidence he has to back up his assertions. Here are 20 questions lawmakers could ask Cohen that might shed new light on the investigations swirling around Trump. 1. You pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow. In a memo for your sentencing, your attorney wrote, \u201cFurthermore, in the weeks during which his then-counsel prepared his written response to the congressional Committees, Michael remained in close and regular contact with White House-based staff and legal counsel to Client-1.\u201d (Client-1 refers to Trump.) Who are the \u201cWhite House-based staff and legal counsel to Client-1\u201d that you remained in contact with, and what instruction did they give you about your testimony?  Though Cohen has already admitted to lying to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project in an effort to diminish the ongoing inquiries into Trump\u2019s possible ties with Russia, it remains unknown if others in Trump\u2019s orbit knew he planned to do so or, worse, directed him to do so. Cohen\u2019s defense attorney offered only this tantalizing hint during the sentencing process about Cohen\u2019s contact with \u201cWhite House-based staff and legal counsel to Client-1.\u201d Cohen could say who those people are, what they knew and when they knew it \u2014 which could have significant implications for them. 2. BuzzFeed News reported that Trump directed you to lie to Congress, and that you told the special counsel as much. Describe any conversation you and Trump had about your testimony. Did he direct you to lie, and did you tell that to the special counsel\u2019s office?  If Cohen were to testify that Trump explicitly directed him to lie to Congress, that would implicate the president in a plot to obstruct justice. At the same time, however, it would raise doubts about the credibility of the special counsel\u2019s office \u2014 which has disputed that is the account Cohen gave them. At the very least, Cohen could help clear up the mystery surrounding the controversial BuzzFeed report and detail what interactions, if any, he had with Trump about his testimony. Cohen\u2019s lawyer has written previously the lie \u201csprung regrettably from Michael\u2019s effort, as a loyal ally and then-champion of Client-1, to support and advance Client-1\u2019s political messaging.\u201d But was Cohen lying merely because he knew what Trump wanted, or because Trump told him to do so? 3. Do you believe Trump obstructed any investigation, and do you have evidence to prove that?  Particularly key would be whether Cohen has evidence that hasn\u2019t been made public yet. 4. Were you ever offered a pardon in exchange for being silent?  If Trump dangled a pardon to dissuade Cohen from cooperating with law enforcement, that could constitute obstruction of justice. 5. Can you provide more information about the frequency and substance of your conversations with Trump about the Trump Tower Moscow project after January 2016?  These conversations are important because Trump repeatedly said he had no business dealings in Russia. He tweeted in July 2016, \u201cFor the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia,\u201d and told reporters in January 2017 that he had no deals there because he had \u201cstayed away.\u201d Cohen\u2019s describing his knowledge of a Trump Tower Moscow project could further expose those claims as false. Cohen has admitted he lied to Congress when he told lawmakers discussions about the project ceased after January 2016. 6. Can you provide any further information about the frequency and substance of your discussions with Trump family members regarding the Trump Tower Moscow project?  In his plea, Cohen admitted that he briefed Trump family members about the project, but no other details were offered. 7. What campaign official did you talk to about possible travel to Russia?  Cohen\u2019s plea says he \u201casked a senior campaign official about potential business travel to Russia,\u201d but it does not say who that official is. 8. Please describe any contact you had with the Russian government about Trump Tower Moscow or other topics during the 2016 campaign. Cohen has described some limited interaction he had with the Russian government about the Trump Tower Moscow project, but this would give him an opportunity to offer more detail on it and other interactions. 9. You have repeatedly denied the allegation contained in the so-called \u201cSteele dossier\u201d that you traveled to Prague during the campaign to meet with Russian operatives. Here today, under oath: Did you or anyone else associated with Donald Trump travel to Europe during the campaign to meet with anyone associated with the Russian government or acting on its behalf? Cohen has repeatedly and publicly denied this claim, which appears in the controversial dossier that levels lurid allegations against Trump, but his doing so under oath would be notable. Cohen, more than most, knows the consequences of lying under oath. 10. To your knowledge, was President Trump ever informed by his son Donald Trump Jr. or anyone else before his son took a meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016? Trump has repeatedly said he did not know that his son met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya during the campaign, and any information Cohen has to contradict the president\u2019s assertion would be significant. 11. Do you believe that President Trump or anyone associated with his campaign coordinated with a Russian effort to interfere in the U.S. election? Cohen has previously insisted he is unaware of any evidence the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia. Any suggestion to the contrary now would be a bombshell. 12. According to court documents, two Trump Organization executives were involved in 2017 with approving your reimbursement for money paid to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. The two executives agreed to describe monthly payments to you as legal services, the documents say, though you were no longer working for the company as a lawyer. Who were those two executives, and do you have reason to believe they knew at the time that that description was not accurate? Court documents do not name the executives. Their knowing the description was inaccurate might connect them to the wrongdoing to which Cohen already has pleaded guilty. 13. How many times did you discuss payments to Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels with President Trump before and after the 2016 election? Describe each of those conversations to the best of your memory.  McDougal, a former Playboy model, and Daniels each alleged affairs with Trump \u2014 which Trump denies. By answering this question, Cohen would be connecting the president in more detail to his own wrongdoing, as he has admitted the payments violated campaign finance law. 14. Did you ever discuss payments to McDougal and Daniels with other members of the Trump family? With other campaign officials? Describe those conversations. Answering this question would connect Trump\u2019s family members to the crimes to which Cohen has pleaded guilty. 15. According to AMI\u2019s non-prosecution agreement, you met with AMI publisher David Pecker and a member of the Trump campaign in August 2015 to discuss how AMI could assist the campaign by buying and burying negative stories about President Trump\u2019s relationships with women. Was the campaign member President Trump? Please describe what occurred at that meeting. AMI is the parent company of the National Enquirer, and signed a non-prosecution agreement to avoid being charged in connection with the crimes to which Cohen has pleaded guilty. Cohen would be implicating Trump in connection with that wrongdoing if he places Trump at this meeting and describes any role he played. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Trump was at the meeting. 16. AMI\u2019s agreement with the government also indicates that David Pecker agreed at that meeting to keep you apprised of any such stories when they arose. Please describe each instance you can recall where Pecker reached out to discuss a possible negative story regarding President Trump?  Are you aware of other instances during the campaign when you helped arrange for people with potentially negative information to be paid for their silence? Please describe any such instances. Cohen pleaded guilty in connection with making hush payments to two women, but having worked for years as Trump\u2019s fixer, it is possible he is aware of other stories Trump wanted kept out of the media. 17. What role, if any, did you play in the March 2016 AMI stories alleging, without evidence, that Sen. Ted Cruz had engaged in extramarital affairs? How about in the AMI story that suggested Senator Cruz\u2019s father could have played a role in assassinating President John F. Kennedy? These are two specific stories that targeted a Trump political opponent. 18. Stormy Daniels has said that in 2011, when In Touch magazine was preparing to publish a story about her alleged affair with Donald Trump, a man threatened her and her infant daughter in a parking lot in Las Vegas. Do you believe that episode occurred, and were you involved in any way? A lawyer for Daniels has alleged this episode occurred and even released a sketch of a possible suspect, though law enforcement has never accused anyone of a crime in connection with the claim. Cohen has previously denied any knowledge of this alleged episode. 19. In January 2018, you produced a letter purportedly from Daniels, denying an affair with the president. Did you discuss that statement with the president before writing and releasing it? As with many of the questions above, Cohen\u2019s answer would speak to Trump\u2019s possible involvement in trying to downplay or dispute allegations of marital infidelity. 20. You have admitted that you lied the last time you testified before Congress, and you will be going to prison for that. Why should we believe you now? Republicans are likely to raise significant concerns about Cohen\u2019s credibility, with good reason. For his explosive assertions to stick, he will need to produce evidence that supports what he says.","155":"Ctrl + N The Pentagon building on\u00a0Dec. 26, 2011. (AFP photo staff\/AFP\/Getty Images) The Pentagon is committing to prioritize ethics and safety as it ramps up its use of artificial intelligence.\u00a0 It's a pledge that\u00a0could ease some of the concerns tech workers at Silicon Valley companies\u00a0have raised about building powerful AI tools for warfare.\u00a0 As the Pentagon on Tuesday\u00a0laid out its first AI strategy\u00a0yesterday to counter a surge of investment in the technology by China and Russia, it promised\u00a0to work with industry leaders to \"advance AI ethics and safety in the military context.\" The Pentagon also promised to \"articulate its vision and guiding principles for using AI in a lawful and ethical manner to promote our values.\" The decision to make this a core part of its strategy indicates the\u00a0Pentagon has taken notice of the\u00a0warnings that top technologists like Elon Musk have made for years\u00a0about the dangers of building AI weapons that humans can't fully control -- and\u00a0Google\u2019s high-profile decision to pull out of a drone software contract with the military last year after employees raised ethical concerns. Researchers concerned about the threat of AI weapons are welcoming the commitment \u2014 but with caution. \u201cIt's encouraging that the Pentagon's says it will articulate its vision for using AI ethically and safely, but the crux is what they'll actually articulate,\u201d\u00a0said Max Tegmark, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and president of the Future of Life Institute, which conducts AI safety research. \u201cIf they come out and say, \u2018We'll never build lethal autonomous weapons without meaningful human control,\u2019 they'll have an easier time recruiting top U.S. AI researchers than if they merely say \u2018that's classified.\u2019\u201d The Pentagon is under pressure to be more transparent as it increasingly courts top AI researchers in the technology industry and academic community.\u00a0The Google decision put a fine point\u00a0on\u00a0the broad gulf between the military and Silicon Valley \u2014 and it's become a matter of national security for the Pentagon to bridge that divide. Experts warn a 21st century \u201carms race\u201d against China to lead the world in AI is underway, and the government will need cooperation from top private sector talent to maintain its competitive edge. \u201cChina has a clear and open strategy to be the world leader in AI,\u201d said Peter W. Singer, a strategist at the New America think tank. \u201cThey also are creating and enforcing the kind of corporate partnerships between business and government that frankly aren't possible here.\u201d\u00a0China exerts more influence over how much top technology companies like Baidu or Huawei cooperate with the government on its AI strategy than the U.S. does over businesses like Google.\u00a0 The Pentagon's\u00a0strategy indicates that the Defense Department plans to do more to foster a better relationship with the tech industry. The\u00a0Pentagon will focus on enhancing its partnerships with industry, seeking \u201cbold new AI initiatives with large industrial partners, small start-ups, and venture capital firms,\u201d the report said. The Pentagon also said it would remove crucial administrative hurdles to make it\u00a0easier for industry to engage with the military. Engaging with Silicon Valley on ethics and safety could be key to the success of any new AI initiatives. In its strategy, the Pentagon committed to invest in AI systems that minimize bias \u2014a key concern industry is also grappling with as it invests heavily in the technology. And\u00a0the Defense Innovation Board, the Pentagon's key liaison to the technology industry, previously said it would develop AI ethics recommendations for the Defense Department this year. The Pentagon released its strategy just a day after President Trump signed an executive order that aims to accelerate U.S. leadership in developing AI, largely through prioritizing AI research and development within the government. China has a had coordinated national strategy on AI for years, and the executive order and the Pentagon\u2019s strategy appear to be the U.S. response.\u00a0 The Pentagon won't be the only agency that has to consider ethical questions as the Trump administration calls for all government agencies to prioritize AI. Given the high-stakes risks involved in how AI should be used by the military, the Pentagon may be forced to stay \u201ca step ahead of the game\u201d and engage in critical discussions about ethics with the tech industry early, said Jennifer Pahlka, the executive director of the nonprofit Code for America, which aims to bring digital services to government. She wants to see more open dialogue between the government and the technology industry about the tough questions that arise as AI is increasingly adopted.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s critical to the future of the country that folks with very different perspectives talk more openly,\u201d she told me. T-Mobile CEO John Legere (L) and Sprint Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure are sworn in before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights hearing. \/ AFP PHOTO \/ MANDEL NGANMANDEL NGAN\/AFP\/Getty Images BITS: T-Mobile and Sprint executives are testifying on the Hill today to defend their proposed merger, my colleague Brian Fung writes this morning. At the hearing, executives will face a grilling on whether the deal \"will hurt competition, raise prices and harm economically struggling Americans,\" Brian writes.\u00a0 \"The hearing by a key congressional panel also marks the first opportunity for lawmakers to personally confront John Legere, T-Mobile\u2019s chief executive, over revelations that he and other company executives have been frequent guests at President Trump\u2019s hotel in the District,\" Brian said.\u00a0 The hearing in front of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce comes as Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and eight other Senate Democrats said they want the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department to reject the merger between T-Mobile and Sprint. In separate\u00a0letters to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and\u00a0Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, the senators said the merger would probably\u00a0\u201craise prices for consumers, harm workers, stifle competition, exacerbate the digital divide, and undermine innovation.\u201d \u201cThis merger will turn the clock back, returning Americans to the dark days of heavily consolidated markets and less competition, with all of the resulting harms,\u201d the senators said.\u00a0\u201cOur enforcement officials are the last line of defense preventing reconsolidation of our telecommunications markets at the expense of American consumers.\u201d Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in Paris on May 23, 2018.

Facebook users have to be approved before they can join those groups on the social network \u2014\u00a0one of them, called\u00a0Stop Mandatory Vaccination, has more than 150,000 authorized members. Some groups also claim that\u00a0options such as taking high doses of vitamin C are a safer alternative to\u00a0vaccines. The spread of such anti-vaccination\u00a0messaging comes as Washington state last month declared a state of emergency due to a measles outbreak, Pilkington and Glenza noted. \u201cParents deserve the truth,\u201d\u00a0Wendy Sue Swanson, who is spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics and has met with Facebook to\u00a0bring up her worries about anti-vaccination\u00a0messages on the platform, told the Guardian.\u00a0\u201cIf they are being served up something that is not true it will likely increase their levels of anxiety and fear and potentially change their uptake of vaccines, which is dangerous.\u201d Apple chief executive Tim Cook in Cupertino, Calif., on\u00a0Sept. 12, 2018. (Marcio Jose Sanchez\/AP) BYTES: Some major news publishers are balking at the financial terms of a news subscription service described as a\u00a0\u201cNetflix for news\u201d that Apple plans to launch this year, the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Benjamin Mullin, Lukas I. Alpert and Tripp Mickle reported. The Washington Post and the New York Times haven't yet agreed to be part of the service partly because of the terms while the Journal has had productive exchanges\u00a0with the tech company but has concerns too, per the Journal. Apple would plan to keep roughly half of the subscription revenue from that service\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which would be incorporated as a paid option in the Apple News app\u00a0\u2014 and publishers probably would not be able to access data about subscribers. \u201cDigital subscriptions are powering growth at big publishers including the Times, whose basic monthly subscription costs $15, the Post, which charges $10, and the Journal, which charges $39,\u201d the Journal reported.\u00a0\u201cSome of those companies are skeptical about giving up too much control to Apple or cannibalizing their existing subscriptions to sign up lower-revenue Apple users, according to people familiar with the matter.\u201d A protest in defense of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in New York\u00a0on Sept. 9, 2017.

Some agencies worry that explosives could be hidden\u00a0inside drones.\u00a0\u201cThe regulation, which was posted Tuesday on a preview website for the Federal Register and takes effect Feb. 23, is part of an effort to bring more oversight to the rapidly growing hobby and commercial drone industry,\u201d Bloomberg News reported. \u2014 A poll found that a majority\u00a0of voters in New York state and New York City support a deal for Amazon to\u00a0open part of its second headquarters in the Queens neighborhood of Long Island City, the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Jimmy Vielkind reported.

In March 2019, Trudeau is mired in scandal after demoting his attorney general when she refused to interfere in the prosecution of a Canadian engineering firm accused of bribing Libyan officials. On Feb. 12, Jody Wilson-Raybould \u2014 whom Trudeau had demoted to minister of veterans affairs \u2014 resigned from Trudeau\u2019s cabinet. On Monday, Trudeau\u2019s troubles grew deeper when another government minister, Jane Philpott, also resigned, citing ethical concerns over Trudeau\u2019s behavior. What\u2019s going on?  Let\u2019s start from the beginning. SNC-Lavalin, the Montreal-based firm at the center of the controversy, is an engineering firm with 50,000 employees worldwide. From 2001 to 2011, the firm allegedly paid the regime of Moammar Gaddafi tens of millions of dollars in bribes. In February, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police formally charged SNC-Lavalin and two subsidiaries with violating the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act. A conviction would leave SNC-Lavalin ineligible to bid on Canadian government contracts for a decade, which could bankrupt the firm. In a separate case, a former SNC-Lavalin vice president pleaded guilty to skirting election finance rules: at issue was $97,000 in SNC-Lavalin-directed illegal campaign contributions to the Liberal Party between 2004 and 2011. Trudeau became Liberal Party leader in 2013. What does Trudeau think about this? Here\u2019s the problem. The government slipped a provision into the 2018 budget that would allow firms accused of paying bribes to enter into deferred prosecution agreements, sparing them from the 10-year ban on government contracting. But the director of public prosecutions, a nonpartisan civil servant, determined in September 2018 that SNC-Lavalin didn\u2019t meet the criteria set out in the new law and refused to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement. It was then that Trudeau and his staff began twisting the attorney general\u2019s arm. Who is Jody Wilson-Raybould?  As attorney general, Wilson-Raybould had the authority to overrule the director of public prosecutions and offer SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement. After studying the case, Wilson-Raybould agreed that SNC-Lavalin wasn\u2019t eligible for an agreement. Wilson-Raybould says this is when Trudeau and his aides wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. Hand-picked by Trudeau to be his minister of justice and attorney general, Wilson-Raybould is the first Indigenous woman to hold the office. Her presence in the cabinet became an emblem of Trudeau\u2019s pledge of reconciliation with Canada\u2019s First Nations \u2014 as well as a confirmation of Trudeau\u2019s strong commitment to a gender-balanced cabinet. But what did Trudeau and his team do? Wilson-Raybould says Trudeau and 10 high-ranking government officials \u2014 including Principal Secretary Gerry Butts, Chief of Staff Katie Telford, Minister of Finance Bill Morneau and the country\u2019s highest-ranking civil servant, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick \u2014 pressured her last fall to take into account the partisan ramifications of her decision. Legal experts argue this runs clearly against Canada\u2019s \u201cconstitutional convention\u201d that the attorney general has an independent role. Testifying before the House of Commons justice committee on Feb. 27, Wilson-Raybould said she had a meeting with Trudeau and Wernick: \u201c[Wernick] said, \u2018They will likely be moving [their offices from Montreal] to London if [you do not halt the prosecution], and there is an election in Quebec soon.\u2019 At that point, the prime minister jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that \u2018I am an MP in Quebec \u2014 the member for Papineau.\u2019 \u201d She reported on another meeting, where Butts and Telford told Wilson-Raybould\u2019s chief of staff that \u201cthere is no solution here that does not involve some interference\u201d and that they \u201cdon\u2019t want to debate legalities any more.\u201d Wilson-Raybould would not budge, and on Jan. 14 Trudeau fired her as minister of justice and attorney general and demoted her to minister for veterans affairs. What\u2019s the political fallout for the Trudeau government?  Trudeau relied on his image as an honest, upbeat and feminist politician to win office in 2015. After Wilson-Raybould\u2019s testimony last week, some pundits believe the political damage is severe, perhaps beyond repair. Since the Globe and Mail broke the story in early February, the Trudeau team has clumsily tried to explain it away, first arguing they hadn\u2019t directed her to make any particular decision, then that they hadn\u2019t pressured her, then that they hadn\u2019t improperly pressured her. Three weeks ago, Trudeau claimed to still have Wilson-Raybould\u2019s support, saying, \u201cHer presence in cabinet should actually speak for itself.\u201d The next day, Wilson-Raybould resigned. Anonymous sources then tried to smear her as a pushy woman who was difficult to work with. That backfired spectacularly, with feminists and Indigenous leaders rallying to Wilson-Raybould\u2019s side. Now Trudeau\u2019s team says he wanted her to consider the jobs that would be lost if SNC-Lavalin were found guilty. And what about the next election? Canadians will go to the polls in October, and what once looked like an assured Liberal victory is now in doubt. Liberal Party poll numbers have fallen by three percentage points, and the opposition Conservative Party is now in first place. If an election were held last week, the poll numbers suggest the Conservatives would have won 153 seats in the House of Commons to the Liberals\u2019 152 seats, with third parties holding the balance of power. The Liberal caucus appears divided between those who applauded Wilson-Raybould for, as they see it, speaking truth to power and those who are furious that their reelection chances now seem at risk. Meanwhile, Gerry Butts, Trudeau\u2019s principal secretary and the architect of his rise to power, had to resign, following the allegations of improper pressure on the attorney general. Could this get any worse? Jane Philpott, another member of Trudeau\u2019s cabinet and a close friend of Wilson-Raybould, resigned Monday, saying that she has lost confidence in the prime minister. She wrote: \u201cI must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities, constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one\u2019s principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.\u201d Cabinet ministers have resigned in the past over differences in politics and policy. Here\u2019s what\u2019s different: There is no precedent in Canada for a prime minister to lose a minister who believes the prime minister\u2019s actions are unethical. Justin Trudeau has just lost two. Tyler Kustra is a visiting fellow at Harvard University and a former economic adviser to the Parliament of Canada.","157":"Michael Cohen\u2019s date with the House Oversight Committee began with a big bang. His opening statement contained most of the day\u2019s major revelations. This was probably inevitable, given that Cohen isn\u2019t your average witness: He was there to get some things off his chest. But that doesn\u2019t mean the hearing didn\u2019t produce some big moments, and perhaps more important, it offered multiple avenues for further inquiry and discovery. Here are a few takeaways. Cohen gave key claims and documents that will birth all kinds of new targets for reporters and, potentially, investigators. But most of his most important contentions require explanation and inquiry. His statement that he heard a phone conversation in which President Trump spoke to Roger Stone about a looming WikiLeaks documents dump before it landed? We still need to know exactly where Stone allegedly got that information and whether it actually came from WikiLeaks. The scene he painted of Donald Trump Jr. whispering to his father, \u201cThe meeting is all set,\u201d around the time of the Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer? Trump\u2019s knowing about the meeting would be significant, but that\u2019s hardly conclusive on the basis of what Cohen says. Cohen\u2019s statement that Trump\u2019s lawyers altered his testimony about the timeline of the Trump Tower Moscow deal? It\u2019s important to know in what way \u2014 and whether they were acting at Trump\u2019s direction. Cohen suggesting Trump inflated his assets while applying for a loan from Deutsche Bank to buy the National Football League\u2019s Buffalo Bills? There are many ins and outs there. The big takeaway here, as it has been in much of the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, is that there is a lot that we don\u2019t know, and it might have been investigated far more than we\u2019re aware. Speaking of which, in one exchange with Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), Cohen hinted at another investigation involving Trump. And he said it involved Trump allegedly breaking the law. \u201cIs there any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven\u2019t yet discussed today?\u201d Krishnamoorthi asked. Cohen responded: \u201cYes, and again, those are part of the investigation that\u2019s currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York.\u201d This would seem to be separate from the campaign finance violations to which Cohen has pleaded guilty (and in which he implicated Trump) and which had already been chewed over in the hearing. It also would not seem to be the SDNY\u2019s probing of the Trump inaugural committee, which had also been broached. And it would be separate from anything having to do with the Mueller investigation, which is not being handled by the SDNY. The most tantalizing prospect is that it might have something to do with the Trump Organization, but we have no idea. If Cohen was there to take down Trump at all costs, as Republicans warned he was, he sure passed on a few opportunities. He contradicted a BuzzFeed News report that Trump had directed him to lie to Congress, saying the direction had been more implicit than explicit. And he shot down a McClatchy report alleging that he went to Prague in 2016 to coordinate with Russians about the election, a key claim in the Steele dossier. But it wasn\u2019t just that. At one point, he was asked about an alleged tape of Trump in an elevator in which Trump hit Melania Trump. Cohen said he had tried to establish whether it existed and found that it didn\u2019t. He said, too, that whatever he thought of Trump, that kind of behavior wasn\u2019t in his repertoire. \u201cMr. Trump would never,\u201d Cohen said. He also disputed another allegation, for which a former Trump employee was paid $15,000, that Trump had fathered a child outside of marriage. There were two exchanges in which Cohen seemed to contradict the public record, and where he might have to explain how his statements are consistent with the facts. He was asked on multiple occasions whether he had sought to work in the White House, and he denied it. \u201cI did not want to go the White House,\u201d he claimed. This is at odds with reporting, including by The Washington Post and the New York Times, indicating that Cohen had sought jobs at the White House but failed to land any. The Post reported that he had been in the mix for White House counsel and had even promoted himself as a possible chief of staff. Cohen seemed to acknowledge at another point that this had at least been run up the flagpole and that it was decided that he would be forfeiting his attorney-client privilege with Trump. \u201cI brought a lawyer in who produced a memo as to why I should not go in because there would be no attorney-client privilege,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in order to handle some of the matters that I talked about in my opening, that it would be best suited for me not to go in.\u201d Another discrepancy involves Prague. He has denied the claim, and here he did so again, this time under oath. But he went even further, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve never been to Prague. I\u2019ve never been to the Czech Republic.\u201d Except he told Mother Jones\u2019s David Corn in 2016, \u201cI haven\u2019t been to Prague in 14 years. I was in Prague for one afternoon 14 years ago.\u201d And he told the Wall Street Journal he was in Prague in 2001, so around the same time. Did he mean he was only there briefly? Is that the same as never having been there? Expect to hear more about this. Update: The Post reports that Cohen also said in a January 2017 interview that he had been to Prague around 2002 but that he drove through the city and did not stop. One of the sad truths about these hearings is that, even for the members who are there to elicit information (rather than grandstand), most of them aren\u2019t very good at it. And that\u2019s especially the case when you only have five minutes to get something out of a witness. Enter the chamber\u2019s much-discussed youngest new member, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). The 29-year old\u2019s questioning was low-key, but it actually unearthed new information. She followed up on others\u2019 questions (a novel concept!) about topics including the ways in which Trump\u2019s inflation of his wealth could be criminal. And she got Cohen to name three Trump Organization executives who would seem to be likely candidates for subpoenas on that point: OCASIO-CORTEZ: Did the president ever provide inflated assets to an insurance company? COHEN: Yes.  OCASIO-CORTEZ: Who else knows the president did this?  COHEN: Allen Weisselberg, Ron Lieberman and Matthew Calamari. Simple but effective. She also got Cohen to name people who might know about a potential treasure trove of information about stories the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company bought the rights to kill them to help Trump. And she laid a predicate for House Democrats to try to get Trump\u2019s tax returns, by asking Cohen whether they would be helpful when it comes to him inflating his assets. Cohen said they would be, and that they could be found at the Trump Organization. All of this could turn out to be useful for Democrats moving forward.","158":"Nearly four decades ago, Donald Trump deceived me into including him on the first Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. He claimed a net worth of $100 million but was actually worth less than a tenth of that. Last week, President Trump declared a national state of emergency to bypass the constitutional budgeting powers of Congress and divert money to build a wall on the border with Mexico. What do these acts have in common? Only that they are the first and latest entries on the continuum of cons that have defined Trump\u2019s success. A real estate insider told me back in the 1980s that Trump\u2019s win-at-all-costs father, Fred, \u201cloves a crook and he loves a showman.\u201d Donald Trump has built his extraordinary career by exhibiting the characteristics of both. He is a self-promoter willing to lie, swindle and destroy to advance his insatiable self-interest. I am not the first journalist to observe that for Trump, the \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d has been the art of the con. But as the first journalist to enable the consummate con man\u2019s career-boosting deceptions, I have a completist\u2019s view of the pernicious racket that is his playbook. Here, in roughly chronological order, are the six essential cons around which Trump has built and sustained his success: Con No. 1: To borrow billions, Trump lies to inflate his net worth. As Trump\u2019s power has grown, his lies have become bolder and more apparent. Early in his career, however, when Trump first conned me into putting him on the Forbes 400 list and then deceived financial institutions to loan him billions of dollars based upon a vastly exaggerated net worth, his deceptions were more elaborate and difficult to track. As recounted in The Washington Post last year, Trump fed me carefully crafted false information for years. This included two long phone interviews in which Trump pretended to be a nonexistent assistant named John Barron, as well as his having his notorious fixer Roy Cohn call me at Forbes in 1982 and 1983 to lie on his behalf. Trump was consistent in maintaining the lies he told Forbes: that he controlled his father\u2019s assets, that his family owned 25,000 apartments (they owned less than half that number), and that his projects had less debt and far more profits than they actually did \u2014 all facts and figures that were hard to challenge. Anyone who listens to the two 40-minute telephone recordings I made in 1984 of the man who Trump\u2019s secretary said was the Trump Organization\u2019s \u201cVP of Finance John Barron\u201d can easily recognize Trump\u2019s thinly disguised voice. Some critics wondered how stupid I had been not to have seen through this ruse. Yet even the most seasoned journalist could not have imagined a prominent figure doing what nobody had, as far as I am aware, dared to do before or since: impersonate a nonexistent spokesman on the phone to national media. The failure of our imagination to respond to Trump remains true to this day. It is not that we underestimate his capacity as a businessman, candidate or president of the United States. It is that we cannot imagine \u2014 and are unprepared to respond to \u2014 anyone who lies and cons as shamelessly and effectively as he does. Trevor Noah of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d framed Trump\u2019s Forbes 400 scam as his \u201corigin lie,\u201d the foundation he built his entire career on. That\u2019s because, as Tim O\u2019Brien wrote in his book \u201cTrumpNation\u201d: \u201cThe more often Forbes mentioned him, the more credible Donald\u2019s claim to vast wealth became. \u2026 The more credible his claim to vast wealth became, the easier it was for him to get on the Forbes 400 \u2014 which became the standard that other media, and apparently some of the country\u2019s biggest banks, used when judging Donald\u2019s riches.\u201d It is hard to imagine that financial institutions would extend $3 billion in loans to Trump\u2019s Atlantic City and New York real estate projects based on his inflated asset statements and Forbes 400 listing without insisting on audited financial statements that demonstrated exactly how much cumulative debt he was on the hook for. Yet during the eight years after he first conned his way onto the list, this appears to be exactly what happened. As with all great con men, Trump is as skilled in the art of deception as he is in the art of promotion. He made certain that nobody could definitively counter his inflated-wealth con by ensuring that a comprehensive balance sheet was never created. As The Post\u2019s Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher wrote in their book \u201cTrump Revealed,\u201d Trump, in 1990, brought in Steve Bollenbach as chief financial officer to respond to lender concerns about his crippling debt. They report: \u201cWhen Bollenbach began delving into the organization\u2019s finances, he got a surprise. The small staff on the twenty-sixth floor of Trump Tower included three accountants. Each knew about pieces of the fraying empire \u2014 the casinos, for instance, or the condos. But no one knew the overall picture; there were no consolidated financial reports.\u201d This was deliberate. And despite multiple bankruptcies, Trump\u2019s inflated-worth ruse remained at the center of his image as a successful businessman, a billionaire able to play the part of a brilliant tycoon on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d reality show and capable of licensing his name for millions of dollars. Although Trump has threatened to sue reporters many times, the only time he followed through with a libel suit was in 2006, after O\u2019Brien, in \u201cTrumpNation,\u201d reported that three experts close to Trump believed his true net worth to be between $150 million and $250 million \u2014 far from the $6 billion he claimed he was worth at the time. Trump lost the suit, appealed the ruling, then lost the appeal in 2011. This was the same year he again demonstrated how important his illusory billionaire status was to him. As noted in \u201cTrump Revealed,\u201d while cooperating with a Comedy Central \u201croast\u201d of him, Trump insisted that the show\u2019s comedians agree to keep only one subject off-limits. \u201cDon\u2019t say I have less money than I say I do,\u201d Trump insisted, according to comedian Anthony Jeselnik. \u201cMake fun of my kids, do whatever you want. Just don\u2019t say that I don\u2019t have that much money.\u201d Con No. 2: To avoid taxes, Trump lies to deflate his net worth. The only people Trump ever wanted to convince that he had less money than he did were those who worked for the Internal Revenue Service. And somehow, despite his inflated public claims of income and valuations, he managed to do just that. Last year, the New York Times published the results of a painstakingly researched investigation into Trump\u2019s tax dodges. The article stated: \u201cPresident Trump participated in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud, that greatly increased the fortune he received from his parents \u2026 He and his siblings set up a sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents \u2026 He also helped formulate a strategy to undervalue his parents\u2019 real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns, sharply reducing the tax bill when those properties were transferred to him and his siblings. \u2026 The president\u2019s parents, Fred and Mary Trump, transferred well over $1 billion in wealth to their children, which could have produced a tax bill of at least $550 million under the 55 percent tax rate then imposed on gifts and inheritances.\u201d Instead, the Times reported, \u201cthe Trumps paid a total of $52.2 million, or about 5 percent.\u201d Virtually every aspect of the Trump family empire operated like a tax evasion scheme. According to the Times, over the years, 295 separate revenue streams were created for Fred Trump to evade gift and income taxes while directing money to his children. Donald Trump not only managed to deflate the value of his family\u2019s assets for tax purposes, but in a con that probably goes unrivaled in American tax-dodging history, from at least 1996 onward, he reportedly erased personal income taxes he would have otherwise paid from profitable ventures like his \u201cApprentice\u201d TV show. How? He used the whopping $916 million loss of the money that had come from the lenders who had backed his casinos. Over the next 15 years, Trump was able to pay no income taxes on this loss of $916 million in other people\u2019s money. But Trump has not been content with schemes to avoid federal government and state tax collectors. The undervaluation con continues full throttle as he evades local real estate taxes on his golf courses. As The Post pointed out in an investigation in 2016, Trump\u2019s attorneys audaciously deflate the value of his many golf courses to minimize local taxes. In his financial disclosures for the Trump National Golf Course Westchester, The Post reported, \u201cTrump valued the course at more than $50 million. But last year, his attorneys filed papers with the state declaring the \u2018full market value\u2019 of the course was far lower: about $1.4 million.\u201d Trump has also been the king of tax-break litigation, suing the city of New York time and time again to take advantage of tax abatements that were never meant to apply to the type of luxury developments he built. Veteran New York Times real estate reporter Charles Bagli added up the staggering value of these tax dodges in a Times investigation titled, \u201cA Trump Empire Built on Inside Connections and $885 Million in Tax Breaks.\u201d During a 2016 presidential debate, when challenged by Hillary Clinton to explain why he refused to disclose his taxes and why he paid no taxes on hundreds of millions in income, Trump replied, \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d Con No. 3: To be a winner, Trump makes losers of those he does business with. To make every business deal with him sound sweeter than it was, Trump marketed his name as synonymous with gold-plated luxury. But few of his deals had happy endings. His narcissistic need to be a winner every time meant that there were losers every time. This included just about anyone who made the mistake of signing a contract to lend or partner or supply goods or services to him. After stiffing his partners and lenders in Atlantic City in 1991 by declaring bankruptcy and forcing them to write down billions of dollars in losses, Trump soon retook control of the properties by creating a public casino company in 1995 and selling the stock to suckers attracted to his name. According to a MarketWatch columnist, \u201cDonald Trump was a stock market disaster,\u201d with Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts racking up more than $1 billion in losses during his 13 years as chairman, while its stock fell from a high of $35 to just 17 cents. But despite making losers of the poor saps who invested with him, Trump emerged a winner, soaking the bankrupted public company for what Fortune magazine estimated was $82 million in compensation. Trump has bragged: \u201cDoes anyone know more about litigation than Trump? I\u2019m like a PhD in litigation.\u201d Unlike all the other things Trump says he knows more about than anybody, this one has a morsel of truth to it. While most Americans expect to do what they promise in a signed contract, Trump sees contracts as mere jumping-off points for \u201cnegotiation.\u201d Knowing that litigation is costly and can drag on for years, Trump\u2019s business modus operandi for stiffed contractors has been, \u201cYou can negotiate with my lawyers for a settlement or sue me and see how long that takes!\u201d An analysis by USA Today published in June 2016 found that during the previous 30 years, Trump and his businesses have been involved in 3,500 state and federal legal cases. Understanding special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation and Trump\u2019s long relationship with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia begins with recognizing that Trump has among the worst reputations of any businessperson in America. As investigative journalist Craig Unger explained in \u201cHouse of Trump, House of Putin,\u201d after burning so many major financial institutions by losing more than $3 billion in Atlantic City and overpriced New York properties, Putin\u2019s \u201coligarchs and Mafia kingpins\u201d were some of the only investors willing to do business with Trump, through untraceable offshore entities. Unger wrote that Trump\u2019s real estate was \u201cused as a vehicle that likely served to launder enormous amounts of money \u2014 perhaps billions of dollars \u2014 for the Russian Mafia for more than three decades.\u201d It is no coincidence that the only major financial institution willing to provide Trump with significant funding after his bankruptcies has been Deutsche Bank, which itself has been the source of fines and investigations related to billions of dollars in transactions by money-laundering clients, including Russian oligarchs. Russian oligarchs were not the only money launderers to fund Trump\u2019s properties. Global Witness, a nonprofit watchdog organization, headlined a scathing expos\u00e9 a few years ago: \u201cNarco-a-Lago: Money laundering at the Trump Ocean Club in Panama.\u201d The report found that many of the presold apartments in the 70-floor Panama City tower were funded by money launderers, including Colombian cocaine cartel members. Reuters reported that, \u201cBy the time the Trump Ocean Club project was complete in 2011, many investors had withdrawn and lost their deposits rather than stump up the 70 percent balance. Bondholders lost, too \u2026 There was one person who still profited: Donald Trump. Court records \u2026 indicate Trump \u2026 earned between $30 million and $50 million from lending his name to the project.\u201d Con No. 4: To win in politics, Trump makes voters believe that his presidency benefits them. One of the great mysteries of Trump\u2019s ascension to power is his support among working-class Americans. He is far from being a person who mingles with the masses. Trump\u2019s social and professional activities have been limited to those who are superwealthy, famous or influential. To the extent that he has interacted with common Americans, it has been as a commercial icon: He sells them chances to lose money at his casinos\u2019 slot machines; he grants them admission to real estate society through the scam that was Trump University; he offers them armchair viewing of crass demonstrations of cruel power in \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d As part of candidate Trump\u2019s campaign to attract working-class Americans to vote against their economic self-interest, Trump bragged that he was \u201cvery highly educated \u2026 I have the best words,\u201d while continually railing against those he calls \u201cthe three most dangerous voices in America: academic elites, political elites and media elites.\u201d He is easily the most successful anti-government populist to have been born with a silver spoon in his mouth. It is no coincidence that at the same time, he is a prolific liar. Accepting Trump\u2019s endless deceits have become articles of faith to any number of the 64 million Americans who, in 2016, were led to believe that his election would benefit them and their families. That Trump frequently lies about something he himself has been recorded saying in the recent past makes no difference to his base. Although the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d prosperity he promises is available only for those who are part of the club of ultrawealthy elites on whose behalf he legislates, Trump supporters willfully listen only to their leader\u2019s words instead of his actions in office. As Trump\u2019s supporters march toward an illusory future with their hate-mongering leader, they remain oblivious to the trillions of dollars that Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the top 1 percent and their corporations will add to the federal debt, or to the forecasts of diminished spending on programs that help most working and middle-class Americans. Trump told a Missouri audience in November 2017 that his tax bill was created to help the middle class and that it \u201cis going to cost me a fortune, this thing, believe me.\u201d In reality, most of the long-term tax savings will go to major corporations and the superwealthy. According to a Forbes estimate, Trump could personally save $11 million annually. Yet his base of working- and middle-class supporters remains blind to the fact that Trump is making America great for himself and not them. That Trump\u2019s lies are believed by so many is a testament to his manipulative mastery of the art of the con. In supporting his wall on the border with Mexico, Trump says that more than 3,000 terrorists were apprehended at the southern border. Yet our government\u2019s own statistics show that the number was zero. Zero! Trump promised that Mexicans would pay for the wall again and again, then denied that he had ever said it and shut down the federal government because Congress refused to pay for it. Trump has even scammed his followers out of core Judeo-Christian values such as compassion. Thousands of children will suffer lifelong trauma because they are being separated from their parents as a result of Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d border policy. When I asked a white, 82-year-old Trump-supporting Floridian grandmother how she supported this policy given her Christian faith, her face seethed with anger: \u201cIt\u2019s their parents\u2019 fault for bringing them!\u201d Scapegoating foreigners for political gain is as old and tragically effective a tactic as appealing to racism. It is the same hatemongering tune that stirs disempowered working-class white people to blame African Americans for their economic challenges. As President Lyndon Johnson said to his young aide Bill Moyers in 1960: \u201cIf you can convince the lowest white man he\u2019s better than the best colored man, he won\u2019t notice you\u2019re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he\u2019ll empty his pockets for you.\u201d Con No. 5: To avoid accountability, Trump makes the media, and truth, the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d  Truth is the greatest threat to Donald Trump. He despises the transparency and accountability that flows from a free press. He continually attacks the media as \u201cthe enemy of the people,\u201d despite increasing violence against journalists by some of his supporters, repeating the phrase in a Wednesday tweet in reference to the Times. Gabriel Sherman, national affairs editor at New York magazine, described Trump\u2019s use of this term as \u201cfull-on dictator speak.\u201d For opponents of Joseph Stalin, being branded an enemy of the people was a death sentence. In Nazi Germany, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels also favored the term, arguing in 1941 that \u201ceach Jew is a sworn enemy of the German people.\u201d In an interview on Sept. 6, 2018, Trump responded to a critical Times editorial by stating, \u201cThe Times should never have done that, because really what they\u2019ve done is, virtually, you know it\u2019s treason.\u201d Trump regularly insults or threatens to sue journalists who refuse to act as stenographers for his lies. \u201cIt\u2019s frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write. And people should look into it,\u201d he said, referring to NBC News on Oct. 11, 2017. \u201cNetwork news,\u201d he tweeted that day, \u201chas become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked.\u201d This prompted Sen. John McCain to note that the comment was \u201chow dictators get started.\u201d Repeat a lie often enough, the saying goes, and it takes root as the truth. The Post has documented (and updates each day) every \u201cfalse or merely misleading\u201d claim that Trump has made since his election, and found that the president has lied more than 8,700 times. The rate of reckless falsehoods uttered per day has accelerated with his time in office \u2014 and with the convictions of his associates stemming from the Mueller investigation. With the help of Fox News, Trump\u2019s relentless deceptions have been successful in attracting and maintaining his core supporters. Trump boasted about the power of the deception of his Fox News-misinformed supporter base when he said, on the campaign trail, \u201cI love the poorly educated,\u201d and also, famously, \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn\u2019t lose voters.\u201d In his cautionary short handbook, \u201cOn Tyranny: Twenty Lessons From the Twentieth Century,\u201d Yale history professor Timothy Snyder identifies core components of fascism that are echoed in Trump\u2019s ability to win and sustain the support of his political base. Snyder reflects on the extraordinary diaries of Victor Klemperer, a professor who survived Hitler and lived to write the tale. \u201cOnce truth had become oracular rather than factual, evidence was irrelevant,\u201d Snyder wrote. \u201cAt the end of the war, a worker told Klemperer that \u2018understanding is useless, you have to have faith. I believe in the Fuhrer.\u2019 \u201d Post columnist Greg Sargent believes that Trump\u2019s war on the truth is worse than simple self-aggrandizement. \u201cWhen Trump insists on his own invented \u2018facts,\u2019 \u201d Sargent wrote, \u201che makes reality-based political dialogue impossible. His utter disregard for truth is a subversion of our democracy and a dereliction of his duty as president.\u201d \u201cFascists,\u201d Snyder writes, \u201cdespised the small truths of daily existence, loved slogans that resonated like a new religion, and preferred creative myths to history or journalism. They used new media, which at the time was radio, to create a drumbeat of propaganda that aroused feelings before people had time to ascertain facts. And now, as then, many people confused faith in a hugely flawed leader with the truth about the world we all share. \u2026 Post-truth is pre-fascism.\u201d Con No. 6: To stoke fear, Trump recasts perpetrators as victims. As president, Trump\u2019s primary governance strategy relies on the same deceptive manipulation of human fear that brought him victory as a candidate. He has proved himself masterful at playing the white Christian male grievance card. Whether it is the foreigners streaming across the border to take American jobs, the dark-skinned urbanites coming for rural Americans\u2019 guns or empowered women upending patriarchal traditions, Trump and his Fox News echo chamber let white Christians know that they are being victimized and that far worse will follow if they do not fight for their right to oppress others. A few months before the 2016 election, Molly Ball published an extraordinary article in the Atlantic predicting how Trump could use fear to win. \u201cRatcheting up fear,\u201d Ball wrote, \u201chelps Trump. \u2026 The fear reaction is a universal one to which everyone is susceptible \u2026 fear makes them cower from the unfamiliar and seek refuge and comfort. Trump channels people\u2019s anger, but he salves their fear with promises of protection, toughness, strength. It is a feedback loop: He stirs up people\u2019s latent fears, then offers himself as the only solution.\u201d Ball quoted a top Republican admaker who explained: \u201cFear is the simplest emotion to tweak in a campaign ad. You associate your opponent with terror, with fear, with crime, with causing pain and uncertainty.\u201d Trump\u2019s argument for building the wall with Mexico, even at the cost of the largest-ever abuse of the doctrine of eminent domain to seize private property, has no basis in rational analysis. All it has going for it is the con man\u2019s relentless playing of the fear card. \u201cThe Democrats,\u201d Trump warned last October, \u201cwill open our borders to deadly drugs and ruthless gangs. The Democrats \u2014 and I say this \u2014 and I've dealt with it \u2014 the Democrats are the party of crime.\u201d Nazi leader Hermann G\u00f6ring once said: \u201cThe people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.\u201d Blaming the victim also works for sexual assault. At least 22 women have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Trump has denied every accusation, proclaiming that these \u201cfalse allegations\u201d were made by \u201cwomen who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me.\u201d At a 2016 campaign rally, he told his supporters who the real victim was. \u201cEvery woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTotal fabrication. The events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.\u201d When it came time to rescue his controversial choice of Brett M. Kavanaugh as Supreme Court justice, Trump repeated the perpetrator-as-victim strategy that had worked so well for him. Bill Shine, Trump\u2019s recently hired deputy chief of staff for communications, was just the right man for the job. Until being forced out of Fox News in 2017, Shine was the right-hand man of Fox CEO and alleged sexual predator Roger Ailes. There, as Vox observed, Shine was \u201ca man with 20 years of experience enabling and covering up rampant sexual harassment, assault, and abuse.\u201d After coaching sessions orchestrated by the White House, Kavanaugh appeared in an exclusive interview on Fox News arguing what the writer Jacob Weindling of Paste termed \u201cthe Bill O\u2019Reilly defense,\u201d the \u201cstandard Fox News sexual harassment playbook of denying everything while painting yourself as the victim.\u201d By the time Kavanaugh faced Christine Blasey Ford, who had accused him of sexual assault while they were in high school, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was arguing that her testimony was part of a \u201cshameless smear campaign\u201d by Democrats to destroy an innocent man\u2019s life. White Christian men are not the only victims in Trump\u2019s imaginary world. America itself is being victimized \u2014 though not by the usual suspects. For more than 60 years, Republican Party voters and their leaders have been the most outspoken enemies of totalitarian Russia, denouncing nuclear disarmament while fanning the fires of murderous foreign wars to stop the expansion of Soviet influence. Now, quite suddenly, Trump has recast Putin, the most ruthless dictator to control Russia since the dark days of Stalin, into America\u2019s friend, while denouncing NATO allies as freeloaders and America\u2019s CIA and FBI as \u201cdeep state\u201d enemies of the American people. Given Russia\u2019s role in propping up his candidacy and real estate empire, it is easy to understand why Trump has done everything in his power to support Putin\u2019s efforts to weaken the NATO alliance. What is tougher to understand are the self-identified conservatives and patriots who suddenly reversed a lifetime of political beliefs to suit the worldview of their corrupt leader. In George Orwell\u2019s dystopian classic \u201c1984,\u201d the empire of Oceania is in an endless war with Eurasia. Then, without notice, in the middle of \u201cHate Week,\u201d the all-powerful Party decides to join with its longtime enemy and be at war with Eastasia, its longtime ally. Once Big Brother makes known its decision, it becomes treason to disagree \u2014 or even to recall the past. Trump\u2019s seemingly limitless power over his core supporters allows him to justify even the most reprehensible behavior and manipulate their fear as he transforms friends into enemies and compassion into hatred. This power is as ominous as Big Brother\u2019s. Fear of a fascist future is what led me to write my new dystopian novel, \u201cAmerica 2034: Utopia Rising,\u201d a spinoff of \u201c1984\u201d set in Trump\u2019s nightmarish fifth term as President for Life. The story opens by describing how Trump declares his second state of emergency the day before the 2020 election, ordering a communications blackout to take control of polling places nationwide. This cautionary tale reflects what I fear may be Trump\u2019s seventh, and most far-reaching, scam: conning Americans out of our democracy.","159":"With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0The most consequential news from the opening statement that Michael Cohen plans to deliver before a House committee today stems from serious allegations about what President Trump knew and when he knew it. The president\u2019s longtime lawyer makes these three explosive charges in his prepared testimony: -- The sound bite of Cohen calling Trump \u201ca racist, a conman and a cheat\u201d will also certainly get lots of play on cable news, but that sounds like sour grapes from a disgruntled ex-employee who is heading to prison for his misdeeds. -- But Cohen\u2019s 20-page opening statement, in which he reflects on a decade in Trump\u2019s inner circle, is perhaps most captivating for the portrait he paints of the man who now leads the country and his methods. In short, Trump\u2019s longtime consigliere, who for years proudly played the role of his enforcer before getting into legal trouble, likens his old boss to a mobster. \u201cMr. Trump called me a \u2018rat\u2019 for choosing to tell the truth \u2014 much like a mobster would do when one of his men decides to cooperate with the government,\u201d Cohen plans to testify. He will open and close his testimony by expressing fear for his safety. \u201cI have asked this committee to ensure that my family be protected from presidential threats,\u201d he plans to say. In and of itself, that\u2019s a remarkable statement \u2014 perhaps unprecedented \u2014 for a witness appearing on Capitol Hill. -- Cohen describes two episodes that, in his telling, sound like they could be in a Hollywood movie about the mob: 1. \u201cI lied to Congress about when Mr. Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016. That was false. Our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign. Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That\u2019s not how he operates. In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me \u2018There\u2019s no business in Russia\u2019 and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie. There were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa caucus in January 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me \u2018How\u2019s it going in Russia?\u2019 \u2014 referring to the Moscow Tower project.\u201d 2. \u201cNothing went on in Trump world, especially the campaign, without Mr. Trump\u2019s knowledge and approval,\u201d Cohen plans to say. That\u2019s why he believes Trump probably knew in advance about the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with the Russians in which the president\u2019s son thought he could get dirt on Hillary Clinton. \u201cI remember being in the room with Mr. Trump, probably in early June 2016, when something peculiar happened,\u201d Cohen will recall. \u201cDon Jr. came into the room and walked behind his father\u2019s desk \u2014 which in itself was unusual. People didn\u2019t just walk behind Mr. Trump\u2019s desk to talk to him. I recalled Don Jr. leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying, \u2018The meeting is all set.\u2019 I remember Mr. Trump saying, \u2018Ok good. Let me know.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s all about family. \u201cWhat struck me as I looked back and thought about that exchange between Don Jr. and his father was, first, that Mr. Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr. had the worst judgment of anyone in the world,\u201d Cohen plans to say. \u201cAnd, also, that Don Jr. would never set up any meeting of any significance alone \u2014 and certainly not without checking with his father.\u201d Former FBI director James Comey answers questions from reporters after finishing his testimony in December before the House Judiciary and House Oversight and Reform committees on Capitol Hill. (Michael Reynolds\/EPA-EFE\/Shutterstock) -- Cohen is not the first person who has dealt with Trump to liken him to a mobster. Fired FBI director Jim Comey wrote last year in his memoir, \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d that dealing with the president gave him \u201cflashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the Mob. The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and above the truth.\u201d According to Comey\u2019s contemporaneous notes, Trump told him: \u201cI need loyalty. I expect loyalty.\u201d In his book, Comey wrote that \u201cthe demand was like Sammy the Bull\u2019s Cosa Nostra induction ceremony.\u201d Andrew McCabe, who replaced Comey as acting director and was later fired as well, has also likened Trump's style to a mafioso\u2019s as he\u2019s promoted his new book, \u201cThe Threat,\u201d this month. \u201cThat kind of overwhelming or overriding focus on loyalty and sorting everybody out immediately\u2014like you're either with us or you're against us,\u201d he said. -- \u201cAn affinity for mobsters and their rhetoric has been a consistent thread through Trump\u2019s adult life,\u201d Trump biographer Marc Fisher observed in a piece for the Sunday Outlook section last November. \u201cFrom his early professional mentor, the New York lawyer and power broker Roy Cohn, to his many years of dealing with mob-connected union and construction industry bosses, Trump has formed close alliances with renegades and rogues who sometimes ended up on the wrong side of the law. He\u2019s long learned from and looked up to tough, street-smart guys who didn\u2019t mind breaking some rules to get things done. Trump also admires mobsters\u2019 no-nonsense language and bias for action; he cites \u2018The Godfather\u2019 and \u2018Goodfellas\u2019 among his favorite movies. \u2026 \u201cTrump\u2019s work as a developer put him in close touch with mobsters from the very start. Early on, he believed that politics and real estate were dirty businesses, riddled with corruption, and he resolved to master the game. On his first building project in Manhattan, the 1970s rehab of the Grand Hyatt New York, Trump hired a notorious demolition company partly owned by a Philadelphia mobster, as well as a concrete firm run by a man later convicted of being part of a mob-run cartel, and a carpentry company controlled by the Genovese organized-crime family. He used some of the same contractors that his father, real estate developer Fred Trump, had employed, including S&A Concrete, which worked on Trump Tower and was owned in part by Anthony \u2018Fat Tony\u2019 Salerno, who ran the Genovese mob. \u201cIn 1981, as he made his first move into casino gambling, New Jersey\u2019s gaming regulators concluded that Trump had been in contact with organized-crime figures. Two men \u2014 Daniel Sullivan, a former truck driver and Teamster, and Kenny Shapiro, an ex-scrap-metal dealer and real estate developer \u2014 played vital roles in finding and acquiring the land on which Trump would build his first casino hotel, Trump Plaza. Sullivan and Shapiro were mob associates.\u201d -- When Cohen agreed to cooperate with prosecutors last August, Trump attacked him on Fox News. \u201cI know all about flipping,\u201d the president said. \u201cFor 30, 40 years, I\u2019ve been watching flippers. Everything\u2019s wonderful, and then they get 10 years in jail and they flip on whoever the next highest one is, or as high as you can go.\u201d Before Paul Manafort took a plea deal, which prosecutors say he later broke, Trump praised his former campaign chairman for fighting the charges in court. \u201cHe refused to \u2018break,\u2019\u201d the president tweeted. -- In the testimony he plans to deliver today, Cohen recalls how he became \u201cintoxicated\u201d by Trump and fell deeper under his spell. \u201cIt monopolized my life,\u201d Cohen will say. \u201cLying for Mr. Trump was normalized, and no one around him questioned it. I knew early on in my work for Mr. Trump that he would direct me to lie to further his business interests. I am ashamed to say, that when it was for a real estate mogul in the private sector, I considered it trivial.\u201d -- Notably, Cohen still refers to Trump \u2014 for whom he once said he\u2019d take a bullet for \u2014 with the honorific. \u201cMr. Trump is an enigma,\u201d Cohen will say. \u201cHe is complicated, as am I. He has both good and bad, as do we all. He is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal.\u201d -- Tweeting from Vietnam overnight before his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump attacked Cohen: \u201cWhite House officials had hoped Trump would not become distracted overseas by the spectacle of his former attorney and fixer testifying publicly for the first time. But the president\u2019s mind, no matter where he is, often is on domestic issues and his political standing, current and former advisers said,\u201d Phil Rucker and Josh Dawsey report. -- Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani also broadly dismissed Cohen\u2019s claims as false: -- To be sure, Cohen certainly has a credibility problem. He was formally disbarred yesterday in New York, in fact, and not all the criminal conduct he pleaded guilty to relates to his work for the Trump Organization. \u201cFor those who question my motives for being here today, I understand,\u201d he will say. \u201cI have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man.\u201d -- But, but, but: He\u2019s bringing receipts. Cohen says he will show the committee a copy of a $35,000 check, signed by the president in August 2017, from Trump's personal bank account that he says was meant as a reimbursement for his payment to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. He says this was one of 11 installments. \u201cThe president of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws,\u201d Cohen plans to say. Cohen also provided copies of Trump financial statements from 2011 to 2013 that he provided to Deutsche Bank, letters he says he wrote \u201cat Mr. Trump\u2019s direction\u201d that threatened his high school, colleges and the College Board not to release his grades or SAT scores, as well as a copy of an article with Trump\u2019s handwriting related to the auction of a portrait of himself. \u201cHe arranged for the bidder ahead of time and then reimbursed the bidder from the account of his non-profit charitable foundation, with the picture now hanging in one of his country clubs,\u201d Cohen will testify. -- Separate from the thicket of legal issues, Cohen will\u00a0make other incendiary allegations that could cause political fallout. Consider these two quotes from the prepared testimony: 1. \u201cHe once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn\u2019t a \u2018shithole.\u2019 This was when Barack Obama was president \u2026 While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. And he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.\u201d 2. \u201cMr. Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft. Mr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. \u2026 He finished the conversation with the following comment: \u2018You think I\u2019m stupid, I wasn\u2019t going to Vietnam.\u2019\u201d Michael Cohen leaves the Capitol last night after a closed-door Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. (Manuel Balce Ceneta\/AP) -- The hearing of the House Oversight Committee starts at 10 a.m. Eastern in the Rayburn House Office Building. We\u2019ll have a live stream on our home page. Read Cohen\u2019s prepared testimony here. -- House Democrats are quietly working behind the scenes to keep a simmering turf war from erupting before the cameras. Rachael Bade and Karoun Demirjian call it an early test of whether Dems can pursue complex and crisscrossing probes of the Trump administration without turning on one another: \u201cSeveral Oversight Committee members are balking at terms the panel chairmen agreed to, dictating that all Russia matters will be addressed by the Intelligence Committee alone. The disagreement flared up during a late-night strategy session Monday, when some senior Oversight Committee lawmakers said they wanted to ask Cohen about Trump Organization connections with Russian oligarchs and Russia finances. The Intelligence Committee is scheduled to question Cohen behind closed doors on Thursday.\u201d Democrats also don\u2019t want to do anything to mess up Mueller\u2019s probe. -- Perjury trap? CNN reported in November that Trump told Bob Mueller in answers to questions from the special counsel that Stone did not tell him about WikiLeaks and that he was not told about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting ahead of time. -- Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) suggested\u00a0\u2014 without evidence \u2014 that Cohen engaged in affairs with \u201cgirlfriends,\u201d something he said might prompt the former Trump lawyer's wife to cheat on him while he's in prison. Gaetz later deleted the tweet\u00a0and apologized, but not before he\u00a0defended it on the House floor.\u00a0Rachael Bade\u00a0reports:\u00a0\u201cThe comment elicited instant pushback from House Democrats, who accused Gaetz of trying to intimidate their star witness.\u00a0...\u00a0Reached by phone Tuesday evening, Gaetz said the tweet 'speaks for itself.' He would not say whether Republicans on the oversight committee intended to use this allegation during Wednesday\u2019s hearing; Gaetz is not a member of the committee, but he is close with Republicans who are, including ranking member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).\" Here's the deleted tweet: -- At least one Democratic lawmaker called for the Ethics Committee to investigate Gaetz for witness intimidation. \u201cThis is grossly unethical and probably illegal,\u201d\u00a0Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) wrote on Twitter.\u00a0Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi stopped short of backing an investigation, but she warned \u201call members to be mindful\u201d about their comments. Gaetz responded to Pelosi's statement: WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Escalation: Pakistan says it shot down two Indian aircraft inside its airspace and launched strikes on Indian-controlled Kashmir. Joanna Slater and Paul Schemm report from New Delhi:\u00a0\u201cThe operation came one day after India sent jets into Pakistani territory for the first time since 1971 and marked a further escalation in tension between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Ministry released a statement saying that its aircraft carried out strikes across the Line of Control, the unofficial border that divides the Himalayan region of Kashmir. The purpose was \u2018to demonstrate our right, will and capability for self-defense,\u2019 it said.\u201d Lori Lightfoot is one of the two\u00a0Chicago mayoral candidates headed to a runoff election. (Tyler LaRiviere\/Chicago Sun-Times\/AP) -- The next mayor of Chicago will be a black woman.

(Taylor Telford) THE IMMIGRATION WARS: -- The House passed a resolution to overturn Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration at the southern border but fell short of the two-thirds majority that would be necessary to overcome the president\u2019s certain veto. Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim, Paul Kane and John Wagner report: \u201cThe 245-to-182 tally was mostly along party lines, with 13 Republicans defecting to side with Democrats on a vote that effectively became a test of GOP loyalty to Trump. Despite their frequent complaints of executive overreach during the Obama administration, most Republicans fell in line with Trump\u2019s decision to try to circumvent Congress to get billions of dollars for his border wall. \u2026 Democrats argued that Trump\u2019s claim of a crisis at the border was baseless and that he was embarking on the road to dictatorship by unilaterally declaring an emergency to try to get money from U.S. taxpayers to fulfill an unpopular campaign promise.\u201d Mitch McConnell said the Senate would vote on the resolution before the chamber\u2019s next recess, which begins March 18. Several GOP senators voiced concerns about the declaration during a closed-door lunch yesterday with the vice president: \u201cOne of those senators was Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who questioned a Justice Department attorney present about how a future Democratic president might be able to use similar emergency powers, according to an official briefed on the meeting \u2026 After attending the lunch with Pence, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he, too, was still evaluating the resolution, but he voiced deep concern about Trump\u2019s decision to declare an emergency. \u2026 Senators said they had a \u2018serious\u2019 discussion with Pence, during which the vice president focused on trying to explain the rationale for the emergency declaration and mollify concerns among rank-and-file Republicans that the reprogramming of funds could hurt their local military installations.\u201d Reminder: Only four Republican votes would be needed to pass the resolution, assuming all of their Democratic colleagues back it. But 19 GOP defections would be necessary to override a Trump veto, which is not going to happen. \u201cOf the 13 House Republicans who opposed Trump, four are conservatives with strong libertarian leanings: Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.), Dusty Johnson (S.D.), Thomas Massie (Ky.) and F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (Wis.). The other nine are more-moderate Republicans, and some represent swing districts where Trump is not popular: Reps. Jamie Herrera Beutler (Wash.), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Mike Gallagher (Wis.), Will Hurd (Tex.), Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), Francis Rooney (Fla.), Greg Walden (Ore.), Fred Upton (Mich.) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), a former member of House GOP leadership.\u201d -- Air Force Gen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, the top U.S. general for homeland defense, told Senators he sees no military threat coming from the border with Mexico. Instead, he said he is focused on the \u201cvery real\u201d threats coming from Russia and China. (Time) -- House Democrats held two hearings casting a fresh spotlight on the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy. Nick Miroff, Maria Sacchetti and Felicia Sonmez report: \u201cSeveral Trump officials acknowledged to the House Judiciary Committee that they did not speak up to supervisors or attempt to stop the implementation of the family separations at the border, despite warnings it probably would traumatize children. Facing aggressive and sometimes angry questions from Democrats, the officials who formulated and carried out the separation system recognized communication failures among their agencies, but defended their actions as an attempt to uphold immigration laws. At another hearing on \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 Tuesday, the House Oversight Committee voted to subpoena records from the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services for documents related to the policy.\u201d -- Internal HHS documents reveal that the agency received more than 4,500 complaints of sexual abuse against unaccompanied minors in custody between 2014 and 2018. In addition,1,303 complaints were reported to the Justice Department during that same time frame, per\u00a0CNN\u2019s Sophie Tatum. Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) said the documents \u201cdemonstrate over the past three years, there have been 154 staff on unaccompanied minor ...\u00a0allegations of sexual assault.\u201d\u00a0He noted that \"this works out on average to one sexual assault by HHS staff on unaccompanied minor per week.\" -- The Wisconsin National Guard is looking into ways\u00a0to potentially punish a\u00a0congressman from Illinois who criticized Gov.

(National Post)  THE SECOND SUMMIT: -- Hours before the summit began, Trump called Kim his \u201cfriend.\u201d\u00a0David Nakamura and Simon Denyer report: \u201cWhite House aides have said the president is determined to sell Kim on a vision of modernization and present him with a choice between continued global isolation and burgeoning economic growth if he gives up the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\u201d -- Walter Pincus notes that Trump appears, ironically, to have taken a more conciliatory tone toward Kim even as North Korea has come meaningfully closer to full nuclear capability than when he was threatening to rain down \u201cfire and fury.\u201d\u00a0In his column for Cipher Brief, Pincus observes that the contours of the tentative deal that the Trump administration is negotiating with Kim \u201csounds very much like\u201d the ill-fated 1994 framework that Bill Clinton agreed to with Kim Jong Il: \u201cKim and his representatives have been offering up Yongbyon in private conversations since last June\u2019s US-North Korea summit. \u2026 In short, dismantling Yongbyon facilities, should that happen, would not close down North Korean production of weapons-grade fissile materials. \u2026 Like his father before him, Kim Jong-un has paused to see what he can get from the U.S. and its allies, based on the substantial advances he has made in becoming a world nuclear player.\u201d --\u00a0Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov inserted himself into the nuclear talks between the U.S. and North Korea as Russia tries to carve itself a bigger role in the negotiations. John Hudson reports:\u00a0\u201cGiven its proximity to North Korea and the need to cooperate over sanctions, Russia has been a natural player in denuclearization talks for previous U.S. presidents, but Trump\u2019s warm rhetoric to Moscow and the country\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election on Trump\u2019s behalf have raised concerns in Washington about any role for the Kremlin in the high-stakes negotiations.\u00a0Analysts have said Russia\u2019s interest stems from its desire to build an energy link between Siberia and the Far East by using North Korea as an energy foothold.\u201d -- Some experts on North Korea are coming around to Trump\u2019s negotiating style. Simon Denyer reports: \u201cTrump\u2019s Democratic foes \u2014 and some Republican hawks \u2014 see dangerous signs of a president without much grasp of foreign policy who could be played by North Koreans. Even Trump\u2019s own intelligence chief, Daniel Coats, testified last month that Kim isn\u2019t likely to give up his nuclear weapons. But there are others \u2014 with deeper knowledge into North Korea than most \u2014 who say Trump\u2019s approach is the best game in town at the moment. They see his willingness to rip up the foreign policy rule book on a gut instinct might \u2014 just might \u2014 be an advantage.\u201d -- The White House\u2019s silence on human rights issues going into the meeting is worrying advocates. Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady reports: \u201cHuman rights concerns may have been shelved out of fears that they would derail nuclear diplomacy. In November,\u00a0the Associated Press reported\u00a0that North Korea accused Washington of \u2018stoking confrontation\u2019 between the two countries when it called for the U.N. Security Council to meet on the subject of human rights abuses.\u201d -- The summit represents one of the greatest tests yet for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has worked to turn Trump\u2019s opinions on foreign policy into a more consistent \u201cdoctrine.\u201d\u00a0Mattathias Schwartz profiles the former congressman for the New York Times Magazine: Tad Devine, then-chief strategist for Bernie Sanders, on the trail in April 2016. (Mary Altaffer\/AP) 2020 WATCH:\u00a0 -- A big shake-up: Bernie Sanders severed ties with a trio of political consultants who were key players in his 2016 campaign. Sean Sullivan and Matt Viser report: \u201cTad Devine, Julian Mulvey and Mark Longabaugh, partners in a high-profile Washington consulting firm, issued a statement Tuesday saying they would not be working for Sanders. They suggested their strategic approach had diverged from that of the Vermont independent. \u2026 According to one person familiar with the conversations, the consultants reached their decision late last week, but they held off on the announcement to avoid upstaging Sanders\u2019s town hall Monday. ... Still, questions remain about the specific nature of the disagreement and how welcomed the consultants were in a campaign that is different from last time.\u201d -- Joe Biden said last night that he has not\u00a0made a final decision about the race\u00a0but that his\u00a0family fully backs a campaign. He\u00a0sounded as if\u00a0he's leaning toward a third run for president. From the AP's Steve Peoples and\u00a0Thomas Beaumont: \"'There\u2019s a consensus,' Biden told an excited crowd during an appearance at the University of Delaware. 'The most important people in my life want me to run.' ... The 76-year-old lifelong politician conceded he may not be popular enough to win over the Democratic Party of 2020. ...\u00a0He gave no firm timeline for an announcement. Last year, he said he planned to make a decision in January, but he had spoken little of presidential politics until Tuesday, instead focusing on foreign policy issues.\u201d Biden acknowledged some of his challenges during the appearance: He lamented how a race against Trump would descend into the gutter, discussed how much campaigns have changed to become more digital and wondered aloud whether he\u2019ll be able to raise the money that\u2019s necessary. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to be a fool\u2019s errand,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cI want to make sure that if we do this, and we\u2019re very close to getting to a decision, that I am fully prepared to do it.\u201d -- In an interview with the Root, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said she is open to decriminalizing sex work, called Trump a \"racist\" and appeared to water down her declaration of support for reparations. From the Root\u2019s Terrell Jermaine Starr: \u201cHarris told The Root that she supports reparations for black people, but that is not precisely what she told The Grio\u2019s Natasha Alford after we spoke with her. For reparations, Harris said she supports the Lift Act, which would provide a tax credit for all families making up to $100,000. When Alford followed up by saying that\u2019s a default benefit to black people but isn\u2019t exactly reparations, Harris [said] \u2026 \u2018Any policy that will benefit black people, will benefit all of society. Let\u2019s be clear about that. ... So, I\u2019m not gonna sit here and say I\u2019m going to do something that only benefits black people. No. because whatever benefits that black family will benefit that community and society as a whole and the country.\u2019\u201d -- Is Harris ready for prime time? From musing about ending private health insurance to her wishy-washiness on reparations,\u00a0there are mounting concerns among Democratic elites about whether she'll hold up under the spotlight of growing national scrutiny.\u00a0The New York Times\u2019s Jonathan Martin looks at her strong start \u2014\u00a0but also her stumbles: \u201cIn this environment, it is perhaps not surprising that Ms. Harris\u2019s first response on private health care echoed as loudly as it did. It was not just because of the implications for the nearly 60 percent of Americans who receive employer-based insurance \u2014 it was also because she made her remarks on live national television. \u2026 In other instances, she appears uneasy committing to a policy at all, perhaps sensing a political hazard. On Saturday, for example, an Iowan asked Ms. Harris if she would favor eliminating the filibuster if Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress and the presidency, to more easily push through the party\u2019s agenda. \u2026 She initially joked that she wanted to change the subject, twice allowed that she was 'conflicted' and did not offer a direct answer.\u201d\u00a0 -- Several Democratic candidates \u2014\u00a0including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) \u2014\u00a0are emphasizing their experiences as mothers. \u201cAnd in doing so, experts say, they are breaking with long-held perceptions of the past that discouraged women in politics from talking about their roles in the home,\u201d Samantha Schmidt reports. \u201cExperts say the shift is part of a broader groundswell of support for women\u2019s issues, building on the women\u2019s marches, the #MeToo movement and particularly the record number of women elected to Congress. \u2026 Gillibrand and Warren in particular have made their experiences as mothers defining themes in the first few weeks of their campaigns, working to connect with a vast segment of voters and push for policies like paid leave, affordable child care and universal pre-k.\u201d -- More than 100 House Democrats are readying a new Medicare-for-all\u00a0plan as the 2020 Democrats continue feuding over their party\u2019s health-care platform. Jeff Stein reports: \u201cRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, is expected to release legislation Wednesday that incorporates key policy demands of single-payer activists, aiming to overhaul the U.S. health-care system even faster and more dramatically than legislation proposed in 2017 by [Sanders]. Jayapal\u2019s Medicare-for-all would move every American onto one government insurer in two years, while providing everyone with medical, vision, dental and long-term care at no cost. \u2026 The bill has 106 co-sponsors but essentially no chance of passing the House or Republican-controlled Senate this term. \u2026 The plan is, in a number of ways, more aggressive than the Sanders plan co-sponsored by more than a dozen Democratic senators.\u201d -- Free-college proposals have also become a staple of Democratic platforms for 2020. The Atlantic\u2019s Adam Harris reports: \u201cFor Democratic candidates now, the question is not so much whether to support a plan to make college more affordable, but what the right approach is for doing so. The details\u2014whether there is an income cap for eligibility; whether the government covers tuition costs up front before grants; whether there are merit or GPA requirements\u2014will determine who will benefit the most, and who will pay for such a plan.\u201d -- In an op-ed for The Post, journalist Paul Heintz, a political editor for the Vermont newsweekly Seven Days who has covered Bernie for years, said he believes a free press won\u2019t give the senator what he wants: \u201cAt a 1985 forum on the media, the late Vermont political columnist Peter Freyne complained to Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, that he had reneged on his promise to hold regular press conferences, pointing out that \u2018When asked a question you don\u2019t want to answer, you leave the room.\u2019 Sanders\u2019s response? An ad hominem: \u2018Peter, you are basically a gossip columnist.\u2019 Decades later, Sanders hasn\u2019t changed. During my time covering him \u2026 the senator has refused to answer questions I\u2019ve posed on topics ranging from gun rights to the Syrian civil war to drone strikes on American citizens \u2014 hardly \u2018political gossip.\u2019 Sanders has always preferred to bypass the news media in order to stay on his chosen message. That\u2019s why he hosted his own cable access show as mayor, his own talk radio show as a member of the House and his own podcast and social media empire as a senator.\u201d -- Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) is taunting Roy Moore into running against him in 2020. \u201cLet's just do it again,\u201d the senator said in response to Moore\u2019s claims that the 2017 election was \u201cstolen\u201d from him. From Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett: \u201cMoore has not directly ruled out a run against Jones for the seat previously held by Jeff Sessions, which is up for grabs in 2020. He told Al.com that he's focusing on clearing his name rather than \u2018thinking about the future\u2019 and if he decides to run he'll \u2018let it be known.\u2019 \u2026 Democrats would be giddy to face Moore again in what's sure to be the toughest race for them in the country next year. Jones said he doesn't have a \u2018preferred opponent\u2019 but made clear that Moore shouldn't be discounted.\u201d -- Despite what his inner circle claims, Republican hard-liner and failed Kansas gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach does not have the White House\u2019s blessing for a Senate run or a Cabinet position. McClatchy\u2019s Franco Ordo\u00f1ez and Bryan Lowry report: \u201cWhite House officials have grown frustrated enough with the narrative being pushed by the Kobach camp that a senior administration official took the rare step of trying to squash the speculation. \u2018Kris is not under consideration for a Cabinet position,\u2019 a senior White House official told McClatchy. \u2026 The soon-to-be open Senate seat [in Kansas] is more important to Trump than any personal debt the president might feel toward the former Kansas secretary of state for his work in the 2016 campaign. Trump was unimpressed with Kobach\u2019s 2018 campaign and he is not convinced that putting Kobach atop the Kansas ticket again is a winning strategy for the GOP.\u201d -- Democratic governors looking to hop on the 2020 train\u00a0face a pretty major hurdle: fundraising.\u00a0From the AP's Bran Slodysko: \u201cThe coming months will likely be an uphill battle for the governors. Though they have resumes full of executive experience, standing out could be difficult in a crowded Democratic field that already includes high-wattage names ...\u00a0Without that name recognition, attracting small, online contributions, such as the ones fueling Sanders\u2019 candidacy, could be difficult as could convincing big donors to invest.\" Nigerias\u00a0president, Muhammadu Buhari, was reelected for a second term. (Ben Curtis\/AP) THE NEW WORLD ORDER:\u00a0 -- Muhammadu Buhari was reelected as Nigeria's president in a vote marred by violence and delays.\u00a0Max Bearak reports: \u201cBuhari, 76, is a former military general who briefly held power in 1984 and 1985 following a coup. He is seen by his supporters as relatively untainted by the corruption that plagues politics in Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\u201d -- Venezuelans are beginning to worry that the opposition and its leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, are running out of steam against President\u00a0Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\u00a0Anthony Faiola and Dylan Baddour report: \u201cAs opposition leaders held a flurry of phone calls and meetings Tuesday to assess their options, the most pressing question was whether Guaid\u00f3 would be able to reenter Venezuela after leaving it over the weekend for Colombia to lead the aid effort and meet with regional leaders. Guaid\u00f3 will seek to reenter Venezuela within 72 hours, opposition officials said. ... The movement he almost single-handedly energized is confronting disappointment and deflated expectations \u2014 and is divided over whether to stay the course of peaceful disobedience or take the fight to Maduro through armed resistance.\u201d -- Iranian President Hassan Rouhani refused to accept his top diplomat's abrupt resignation.\u00a0Erin Cunningham reports:\u00a0Mohammad Javad Zarif \u201csubmitted his resignation late Monday in a shock decision he said was made to 'defend the integrity' of the Foreign Ministry. ...\u00a0The announcement Tuesday that Rouhani, a relative moderate and pragmatist, had not accepted Zarif\u2019s resignation added to a day of high drama and political intrigue in the Iranian capital as officials urged Zarif to stay on as foreign minister.\u00a0Zarif\u2019s political allies in Iran mobilized Tuesday to prevent his resignation, and more than 150 parliamentarians signed a letter calling on Rouhani to keep Zarif, state media outlets reported.\u201d\u00a0 -- The Taliban\u2019s rigid ideology appears to have changed little, particularly around gender roles, as peace talks with U.S. officials continue.\u00a0CNN\u2019s Clarissa Ward, Najibullah Quraishi and Salma Abdelaziz spent\u00a036 hours with the militant group and described visiting a local religious school: \u201cWe see dozens of children -- boys and girls -- poring over their Qurans, reciting verses as they rock back and forth. Most of the girls are between 8 and 10, and several tell us they can read. \u2026 It doesn\u2019t take long for this carefully crafted illusion of gender equality to be shattered. [Their teacher] adds that once the girls hit puberty, they can no longer be educated in the same school as boys, because there might be contact between the sexes. That means there need to be separate schools for the girls. So far, those don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s the same excuse that the Taliban used two decades ago to deprive millions of girls of education.\u201d -- Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley was nominated to Boeing's board of directors.\u00a0Haley is expected to help guide the company in the global aerospace market and might be approved to join the board in April.

Her approval rating has risen eight points since November, and now sits higher than it has been in more than a decade. ...\u00a0She welcomed Rolling Stone staff writer Tessa Stuart and the magazine\u2019s founder, Jann S. Wenner, into the speaker\u2019s office, where there are frescoes on the ceiling, oil paintings of the San Francisco Bay and the California coastline, and an expansive view of the Washington Monument. She wore a long, thin gold pin, with a tiny eagle perched on top. It was a mace: the ancient Roman symbol of power. Technically, it\u2019s a bludgeon \u2014 the person who wields the bludgeon holds the power. After retreating from a 35-day standoff with her over funding for his border wall, President Trump seemed well aware who wielded the bludgeon in their relationship, at least for the moment.\u201d\u00a0 -- \u201cAngela Davis is beloved, detested, misunderstood.

(The bill would close what's called \u201cthe gun show loophole\u201d by including such venues, which are now exempt, in the requirement for background checks on all guns sold through licensed dealers.) But the Democratic consensus also reflects a larger shift in the party whose implications extend far beyond issues relating to guns. \u2026 The willingness, even eagerness, of most House Democrats to embrace new gun control measures highlights how the party's evolution into a metropolitan-based coalition is shifting its incentives -- and reconfiguring its central fault line.\u201d HOT ON THE LEFT: \u201c\u2018Where are the Obamas?\u2019: Paintings of Barack and Michelle brought a million more people to Portrait Gallery,\u201d from Peggy McGlone: \u201cJustin Philip was back in line for the second time that day, waiting for another chance to snap a selfie with Kehinde Wiley\u2019s portrait of Barack Obama. \u2018It\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m here,\u2019 the New York resident said of his visit to Washington\u2019s National Portrait Gallery, where the paintings of the former president and first lady Michelle Obama, by Amy Sherald, have drawn millions of visitors in the year since they were unveiled. \u2026 The Obama portraits have catapulted the Smithsonian museum to the top tier of the city\u2019s attractions by dramatically increasing attendance.

A House Ways and Means Committee panel brought in several experts in tax law to discuss the impact of a provision in Democrats\u2019 anti-corruption bill that would compel presidential candidates to release 10 years of tax returns within 30 days of receiving their party\u2019s nomination. The provision would apply to Trump, but Republicans oppose the measure and are expected to have the votes to block it in the Senate. \u201cWe will examine a topic of great interest to the American people: We will review whether a president, vice president, [or other candidates for office] .\u2009.\u2009. should be required by law to make their tax returns available to the public,\u201d said Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), chair of the oversight subcommittee conducting Thursday\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe will ask the question: Does the public have a need to know that a person seeking the highest office in our country obeys tax law?\u201d The subcommittee was not expected to take action Thursday to specifically seek Trump\u2019s tax returns, but the hearing was part of its broader push to lay the groundwork for a potential request, with lawmakers expected to ask about their authority to request the records. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said Democrats must proceed with caution in seeking Trump\u2019s returns, noting the need to be precise in crafting the request of the Treasury Department. \u201cWe have to be very, very careful as we go forward,\" Pelosi told reporters on Thursday. \u201c .\u2009.\u2009. In terms of the tax issue, it\u2019s not a question of just sending a letter. You have to do it in a very careful way, and the chairman of the committee will be doing that.\u201d Republicans have castigated attempts to examine Trump\u2019s personal records as \u201cpresidential harassment,\u201d with Trump taking to Twitter repeatedly to claim they were going \u201cnuts\u201d with investigations. At his State of the Union address, Trump slammed Democrats for their investigations, which are being led by multiple committees and extend beyond the scope of his tax returns. \u201cAn economic miracle is taking place in the United States \u2014 and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.\u201d Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, said Congress is barred from releasing tax returns for political purposes. \u201cSuch an abuse of power would open up Pandora\u2019s box that would be tough to get a lid back on. It would set a very dangerous precedent. And the question is, \u2018Where does it end?,\u2019\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWhat about the tax returns of the speaker? Members of Congress? Federal employees? Or, for that matter, any political donors? There is no end in sight for those whose tax information may be in jeopardy.\u201d Trump has said he cannot release his returns because he is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. He has also said his returns are \u201cextremely complex\u201d and that there is \u201cnothing to learn\u201d from them, according to Bloomberg. Every president has released at least one year of annual tax returns since the 1970s. Trump\u2019s tax returns have been the subject of intense speculation in American politics since he refused to release them during the 2016 presidential campaign. A 1924 law gives authority to the chair of the Ways and Means Committee, the chair of the Senate Finance Committee and the chair of the Joint Committee on Taxation to request in writing taxpayer information from the Treasury Department. Four Trump administration sources have told Politico that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin could block the tax returns\u2019 release on the grounds that Democrats would be unable to prevent them from leaking, which would be a felony. A coalition of three liberal groups \u2014 the Tax March, Indivisible, and Stand Up America \u2014 wrote Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), the Ways and Means chairman, last month to push him to \u201cimmediately\u201d obtain Trump\u2019s tax returns, according to Roll Call. The committee\u2019s work has been delayed by the longest-ever government shutdown, which ground much of Congress\u2019s committee work to a halt. \u201cWe need to see them,\u201d said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a liberal member of Congress, adding she understood the request had to be carefully crafted. \u201cWe need to get that as soon as possible now that we have the opportunity to do it, and it ought to be at the top of the list. I think it will reveal a lot.\u201d Mike DeBonis contributed to this report.","161":"A day after President Trump declared a national emergency \u2014 in an attempt to circumvent Congress and redirect taxpayer money to fund 230 miles of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 the designation has been beset with political and legal challenges. Democrats painted Trump\u2019s declaration as evidence of a rogue president who has finally gone too far, and they vowed to stop him. While some Republicans said they supported Trump, others expressed disapproval, fearing the move would set an undesired precedent or deprive other projects of necessary funds. Even in his declaration, Trump said he expected to be sued and anticipated the Supreme Court would ultimately decide the case. Still, in a freewheeling news conference Friday, he attempted to justify the executive action in hopes of fulfilling a campaign promise that has eluded him for two years. Hours later, Trump flew to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, and was spotted at his West Palm Beach golf club Saturday morning. By Saturday, the national emergency declaration had triggered at least one protest in New York, with various groups promising to hold more across the country on Presidents\u2019 Day. Also on Saturday, acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan said Saturday he would soon start to examine projects that could be delayed or canceled to free up funds for border activities. Speaking to reporters at the close of his first overseas tour since becoming Pentagon chief last month, Shanahan said the military\u2019s Joint Staff had been conducting a \u201cmission analysis\u201d on ways to deal with drugs and migrants at the border. \u201cBased on that, we can do an assessment of what would be appropriate,\u201d he said. Shanahan said the department had been preparing for weeks for a potential emergency declaration. A defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning, said the military\u2019s analysis included an assessment of where border barriers would be most effective in consideration of national security. Shanahan said he had leeway to determine a final figure from available funds that would be used for border-related activities \u2014 $3.6 billion from designated military construction funds. He said service secretaries would be involved in identifying affected projects. \u201cAll of this money has been assigned for different purposes, so it comes down to: What are you going to trade off?\u201d he said. The defense official said it was possible though unclear whether the Pentagon would devote its entire military construction pool of $3.6 billion to the border. Shanahan said certain projects would not be considered, including military housing. \u201cWe are following the law, using the rules,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not bending the rules.\u201d  Trump\u2019s announcement capped a frenetic two-month period that included the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, at 35 days; the reemergence of Democrats as a political force; and a Republican Party caught between taking signals from Trump and bucking his unconventional impulses. It also begins a new phase of his presidency that will test the separation of powers, as he sidesteps Congress despite Republicans urging restraint. During his 50-minute, meandering news conference in the Rose Garden, Trump offered little empirical evidence to back up his assertion that there is a crisis on the border that requires an extraordinary response. Instead, he invoked hyperbolic, campaign-style rhetoric about lawlessness that he said only walls could suitably address. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs,\u201d he said. He used the word \u201cinvasion\u201d seven times. He later said the emergency declaration wasn\u2019t urgent but rather expedient, as it would help him build a wall more quickly than Congress would allow. \u201cI could do the wall over a longer period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to do this, but I\u2019d rather do it much faster.\u201d   The legal challenges came almost immediately. On Friday, the advocacy group Public Citizen filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington, seeking to block Trump\u2019s declaration on behalf of three Texas landowners and an environmental group. \u201cWe just sued Trump over his fake national emergency,\u201d the group stated. \u201cIf Trump gets away with this, there\u2019s no telling what the next concocted \u2018emergency\u2019 will be, who will be targeted and what emergency powers will be claimed.\u201d  Another advocacy group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, sued the Department of Justice Friday for failing to provide documents \u2014 including legal opinions and communications \u2014 related to the president\u2019s decision to declare a national emergency. \u201cAmericans deserve to know the true basis for President Trump\u2019s unprecedented decision to enact emergency powers to pay for a border wall,\u201d the group\u2019s executive director, Noah Bookbinder, said in a statement. \u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s inadequate response raises major questions about whether even the president\u2019s own administration believes there is a legal basis for him to bypass the constitutional authority granted to Congress to appropriate funds.\u201d  On Saturday evening, the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, filed another lawsuit in federal court, saying the president has failed to identify a legal authority to take such an action, \u201cand Congress has not enacted any emergency legislation even remotely related to border wall construction, and thus the president\u2019s reallocation of funds is unlawful.\u201d  California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, said he planned to work with other states to take legal action against the White House. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was preparing a lawsuit for early next week, arguing that Trump cannot legally redirect taxpayer money during an \u201cemergency\u201d unless it\u2019s for military construction projects that support the armed forces. Trump also faces political pushback, including from members of his party. Democrats and several Republicans predicted a two-pronged response to the declaration: one, having Congress vote to reject it in the coming weeks, and two, suing Trump \u2014 or at least aiding other parties that attempt to intervene. \u201cThe president\u2019s actions clearly violate the Congress\u2019s exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \u201cThe Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.\u201d  Most notably, Pelosi and Schumer said, \u201cWe call upon our Republican colleagues to join us to defend the Constitution.\u201d    Pelosi\u2019s office is in the process of amassing a list of nearly 400 projects nationwide that could be jeopardized by the diversion of funds to construct a border wall, the Hill reported. Republicans are divided over Trump\u2019s declaration, with many unnerved by what they see as an executive power grab, while others are unwilling to challenge the president ahead of 2020 presidential and congressional elections.  Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who faces a reelection race next year, suggested it would be hypocritical for Republicans to support the emergency declaration after criticizing President Barack Obama for \u201cexecutive overreach.\u201d He warned that future Democratic presidents might follow Trump\u2019s precedent. Tillis described a future \u201cPresident Bernie Sanders declaring a national emergency to implement the radical Green New Deal\u201d or a \u201cPresident Elizabeth Warren declaring a national emergency to shut down banks and take over the nation\u2019s financial institutions.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t believe in situational principles,\u201d he said. Other Republicans lodged an even more straightforward objection: Declaring a national emergency might prompt Trump to shift funds from other desperately needed projects. Rep. Mac Thornberry (Tex.), the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, warned against tapping Defense Department and military construction accounts to build the wall. \u201cDoing so would have detrimental consequences for our troops,\u201d he said in a Thursday statement. \u201cAnd it would undercut one of the most significant accomplishments of the last two years \u2014 beginning to repair and rebuild our military. I hope that the president will pursue other options.\u201d  The issue was more than a constitutional discussion for Republicans. Democrats signaled that they would proceed with a privileged resolution of disapproval that would force GOP lawmakers to vote for Trump\u2019s wall or oppose his emergency claim \u2014 with certain political repercussions. By Friday afternoon, Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) said he had gathered more than 60 co-sponsors for the resolution. Such a measure would pass in the Democratic-controlled House, and more than enough Republicans could break ranks to ensure its Senate passage. But Trump is certain to veto the resolution, and Congress probably couldn\u2019t muster enough votes to override a veto. Democratic legislative staffers huddled on Capitol Hill at 2 p.m. Friday, shortly after the White House issued its proclamation. According to a senior Democratic aide, no decisions have been made on how Congress will proceed with a formal measure of disapproval, but House and Senate leaders are expected to move carefully to win over as many Republicans as possible.    White House officials want to approve projects and reallocate money as quickly as possible, but no timeline has been given. Part of their strategy is to try to use eminent domain to seize private property along the border, particularly in Texas, where they want to install parts of the barrier. Other parts of the approach are equally unclear. White House officials have not said, for example, how they plan to solicit bids on the projects or what process they will follow.  Trump has long asserted that the United States is full of rapists, murderers and other violent criminals who enter illegally from Mexico, and he has pledged to address the situation by building a wall. Government data, though, shows that attempted border crossings remain near 40-year lows and that drug traffickers primarily attempt to smuggle hard narcotics through ports of entry, not through gaps between border barriers, as Trump has suggested. The biggest challenge on the border in recent years has been a surge of families seeking to cross into the United States and claim asylum, overwhelming border agents and U.S. facilities. White House officials plan to use $8 billion to build fencing that they believe will block or discourage a wide range of immigrants. Of that money, $1.375 billion was approved by Congress on Thursday, and it can be used for 55 miles of \u201cpedestrian fencing\u201d in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. The White House plans to use $600 million from the Treasury Department\u2019s forfeiture funds account, which contains money seized by the federal government from a range of illicit activities. An additional $2.5 billion would be redirected from a Pentagon program for countering drug activities, and a final $3.6 billion would be moved from military construction accounts. It\u2019s that final pot of money that White House officials said required the national emergency declaration, as the White House is generally barred from moving money from one account to another without congressional approval. Trump promised during the 2016 campaign to build a border wall and have Mexico finance it. Since becoming president, he has insisted instead the money should come from U.S. taxpayers. White House officials said that more than 50 national emergencies have been declared since the 1970s, attempting to rebut concerns that Trump was outside his authority in taking this step. \u201cThis is authority given to the president in law already,\u201d said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if he just didn\u2019t get what he wanted, so he\u2019s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money.\u201d  But some presidential historians said Trump\u2019s move was unusual, in part because he stopped short of describing how it would ameliorate a situation that he hasn\u2019t precisely defined. White House officials on Friday wouldn\u2019t disclose where the border barriers would be placed. Presidents have taken extraordinary steps before, at times invoking crises facing the United States. Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus during the Civil War in 1861, making it easier to arrest someone without bringing the individual before a judge. President Harry Truman tried to nationalize the steel industry in the 1950s amid tensions brought by the Korean War; he was rebuked by the Supreme Court. Presidential scholars said Trump\u2019s move on Friday, though extreme in its rhetoric, will be viewed much differently, even if he attempts to use the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to buttress his case. That\u2019s because Trump isn\u2019t responding to a crisis that\u2019s evident to the American people but is instead taking action after Congress rejected his funding request for the past two years. \u201cIt shrinks the importance of Congress even more,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian. \u201cIt is a wild-eyed imperial presidency.\u201d     Devlin Barrett, Josh Dawsey, Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and Rachael Bade contributed to this report.

In Trump\u2019s annual budget request to Congress, he will request $5\u00a0billion in funding for the Department of Homeland Security to continue building sections of a wall, three people briefed on the request said. He will request an additional $3.6\u00a0billion for the Defense Department\u2019s military construction budget to erect more sections of a wall. The people describing the request spoke on the condition of anonymity because the budget proposal had not been made public, but a top White House official acknowledged the \u00adrequest \u00adin an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Reuters first reported the $8.6\u00a0billion figure. Asked whether Trump\u2019s request signals that a new budget fight is coming, Larry Kudlow, the White House\u2019s top economic adviser, said, \u201cI suppose there will be. I would just say that the whole issue of the wall, of border security, is of paramount importance. We have a crisis down there. I think the president has made that case very effectively.\u201d Top Democrats reacted swiftly to reports that Trump was seeking more money for the wall, reflecting how they are girding for the fight and betting that public sentiment is on their side. Rep. Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.), who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said the request was \u201cnot even worth the paper it\u2019s written on.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) added that Trump caused a government shutdown in December because he defied Congress and demanded a wall. They said lawmakers were prepared to block his demand this time as well. \u201cThe same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cWe hope he learned his lesson.\u201d The request will come as part of a broader proposal to cut $2.7 trillion in spending over 10 years for programs including welfare assistance, environmental protection and foreign aid. At the same time, Trump will seek to boost the military\u2019s budget from $716\u00a0billion to $750\u00a0billion next year. The contrast is meant to bring into sharper focus the White House\u2019s priorities heading into budget negotiations this summer, even if many lawmakers have declared the proposals dead on arrival. The wall demands will attract a particular focus because of Trump\u2019s willingness to amplify the immigration debate into a political brawl. He led a government shutdown in December that lasted for 35 days because Congress would not appropriate $5.7\u00a0billion to build sections of his long-promised wall. Eventually, Trump relented and reopened the government. A few weeks later, Congress agreed to provide $1.375\u00a0billion to finance 55 miles of barrier on the border in Texas. To extract more funds, Trump last month declared a national emergency and said he would redirect more than $6.7\u00a0billion from other programs to build more sections of the wall. The emergency declaration unsettled many lawmakers, including some of his key allies in the Senate. A number of Republican Senators have said they oppose Trump\u2019s attempt to move money without congressional approval, and the chamber is set to pass a measure to overturn the declaration in the coming days, which the president is expected to veto. Even with the stiff congressional opposition, Trump\u2019s new budget request shows he plans to continue fighting on the issue in the coming months. Congress and the White House must agree on a new budget deal by the end of September. They also must pass a measure to raise the debt ceiling in September or October, or they will risk having the government fall behind on its obligations, which could rattle the economy and financial markets. House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said the request is \u201ca shot across the bow.\u201d By signaling Monday that he wants billions in additional border wall funding to be part of any deal, Trump is sending a message to lawmakers about his budget priorities. The number of people crossing illegally into the United States from Mexico had fallen in recent years, but there has been a sharp increase in recent months. The number taken into custody along the border rose 31 percent last month in large part because of a wave of families trying to enter the United States from Central America. One senior administration official said the $8.6\u00a0billion in additional funding, combined with the money Trump is attempting to redirect with his national emergency declaration, would allow the White House to complete at least 722 miles of barriers \u2014 a figure that has long been a White House goal. White House officials say there are already 122 miles of barriers that have been completed or are under construction. Some of those barriers replace fences that had previously existed, and Democrats have routinely said Trump is claiming credit for building walls that don\u2019t exist or that are far from being completed. During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised repeatedly to build a wall along the Mexican border. He also said Mexico would pay for it, though the Mexican government has repeatedly refused to finance the project. Since becoming president, Trump has changed his description of how the wall would be financed, at first saying Mexico would eventually pay the U.S. government back and later scrapping any mention of Mexico sending money to the United States. Instead, he has insisted that the money come from U.S. taxpayers, arguing that criminals, terrorists and drugs are flooding into the United States from across the southern border. His top advisers have not provided information to back up many of those assertions, but Kudlow said Sunday that Trump planned to keep fighting. \u201cHe\u2019s going to stay with his wall, and he\u2019s going to stay with the border security theme,\u201d Kudlow said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s essential.\u201d Pelosi and Schumer said Sunday the money would be better spent on projects like education and workforce development, among other things. The $8.6 billion request would represent less than 0.5\u00a0percent of the White House budget plan, which will eclipse $4 trillion. The proposal would, among other things, cut more than $1.1\u00a0trillion from Medicaid and other health-care programs over the next decade by turning over more control to states, according to a summary reviewed by The Washington Post. Medicaid is a health-care program for low-income and disabled Americans, run jointly by states and the federal government. Some Republicans and the White House have repeatedly proposed slashing its benefits, alleging it is wasteful, while many Democrats and a number of Republicans have sought to expand the program as a way to provide more benefits for the poor. The White House\u2019s new budget plan would also cut $327\u00a0billion from other welfare programs, including those that provide food and housing assistance, in part by imposing mandatory work requirements for certain recipients. It would cut an additional $207\u00a0billion by making changes to student loan programs over 10 years and $200\u00a0billion more by changing federal retirement programs and making major changes to the U.S. Postal Service. The budget would call for severe reductions at a number of federal agencies. It will propose a 12\u00a0percent cut at the Education Department, a 12\u00a0percent cut at the Department of Health and Human Services, an 11\u00a0percent cut at the Interior Department, a 23\u00a0percent cut at the State Department, a 32\u00a0percent cut at the Environmental Protection Agency and a 22\u00a0percent cut at the Transportation Department, according to the summary. Almost all of the proposals would require congressional approval, and lawmakers have dismissed cuts of a similar size in Trump\u2019s past budgets. Many Democratic leaders have said they will oppose the sweep of the White House\u2019s proposed cuts, though administration officials have signaled they plan to fight over the budget much harder this year, saying it provides a sharp contrast between Democrats and Republicans heading into the final year of Trump\u2019s first term. Even with the proposed cuts, the White House plan does not project eliminating the budget deficit until the mid-2030s. This is in part because Trump has instructed aides not to pursue any structural changes to Medicare, the health-care program for millions of older Americans.","163":"THE PROGNOSIS President Trump gestures as he finishes his 2018\u00a0State of the Union address in the House chamber of the U.S. Capitol. (Win McNamee\/Pool\/AP) Call it a bipartisan gesture or clever politics. But President Trump is expected to embrace in tonight\u2019s State of the Union address an issue near and dear to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.): halting the spread\u00a0of HIV. The president plans to propose a \u00a0goal of halting new transmissions of the AIDS virus by 2030 by providing more funding for treatment and prevention, a plan advocates say has been worked on for months by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the president is expected to lay out broad goals during his speech to Congress, more details could come Wednesday morning from Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at HHS who has been closely involved in the effort. Giroir is scheduled to deliver a keynote address to the American Public Health Association. HHS is expected to roll out the plans within days, my colleagues Lenny Bernstein, Lena Sun and Amy Goldstein report. At this juncture, it\u2019s certainly difficult to imagine Pelosi and Trump joining hands on anything of significance, after unprecedented partisan rancor that left the government partially shuttered for weeks and delayed the address itself. The two exchanged barbs during the shutdown, with the speaker seeking to display her control over the House by uninviting the president to give his annual address and Trump denying her the use of military aircraft for a\u00a0trip to Afghanistan. Pelosi\u2019s response to an HIV plan could also be tempered by the array of actions the Trump administration has taken to peel away the Affordable Care Act, including refusing to defend it in court. And responding to HIV\u00a0is just one of several health-related topics the president could bring up tonight \u2014\u00a0including the high cost of prescription drugs, surprise medical bills and paid family leave. But it\u2019s one that could still win him some applause from Pelosi and her Democratic Caucus. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). (Paul Morigi\/Getty Images) Combating the spread of the virus was a top priority for Pelosi when she joined Congress in 1987, representing a district that was being ravaged by the disease. As a House freshman, she focused her first-ever floor speech on the topic, saying Congress must \u201ctake leadership of course on the crisis of AIDS.\u201d She has testified on AIDS funding before congressional committees and worked with the George W. Bush administration to ramp up global funding to comnbat the disease. The patient community is already responding favorably to reports of Trump's\u00a0plan. Greg Millett, director of public policy for the American Foundation for AIDS Research, told Lenny, Lena\u00a0and Amy\u00a0that\u00a0the initial plan may focus on wiping out HIV transmission in 46 U.S. counties responsible for about half of all new HIV cases in the United States, based on information he has seen. \u201cI think it\u2019s definitely possible to end HIV transmission in specific places in the United States,\u201d Millett said. \u201cAnd the reason I say that is that we\u2019re already on a trajectory to do that.\u201d \u201cIt sounds like a bold initiative,\u201d Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute and co-chair of the Presidential\u00a0Advisory Council on HIV\/AIDS, told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to end HIV by 2030, this is how it\u2019s going to be done \u2014 through increased treatment and increased prevention.\u201d Here are some other health-care policies Trump could touch on tonight: 1. Surprise medical bills. Many Americans report difficulties in understanding upfront how much their care will cost. It\u2019s common for patients to undergo a surgery or outpatient procedure they think is fully covered under their insurance\u00a0plan, only to later receive a hefty bill because one or more of their providers were out of network. This issue has caught the attention of members of Congress from both parties. The American College of Emergency Physicians recently released a six-point plan to counteract the problem, and Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) have introduced legislation to stop unexpected charges. \u201c[People] go in, they have a procedure, and then all of a sudden they can't afford it;\u00a0they had no idea it was so bad,\u201d Trump said at a patient roundtable in January. \u201cWe're going to stop all of it, and it's very important to me.\u201d 2. The high cost of U.S. drugs. On Thursday,\u00a0HHS\u00a0proposed banning drug rebates paid to pharmacy middlemen that Trump has often blamed for high drug prices. It\u2019s the latest in a series of agency actions taken by the administration over the past year to tamp down drug costs. There\u2019s a good chance of hearing more tonight from Trump, who has been eager to tout successes in this area. \u201cIt\u2019s like Nixon going to China, in my world, for the president to take on drug pricing out there,\u201d Bill Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told reporters yesterday. 3. Abortion. Antiabortion advocates have pressed Trump to highlight recent state bills in New York and Virginia that would have lifted some limits on late-term abortions. The Virginia measure, which has been tabled, would have allowed a single doctor to sign off on a third-trimester abortion instead of the three currently required and would have removed language requiring the danger to the mother be \u201csubstantial and irremediable.\u201d The new law in New York allows women to now get late-term abortions if their health \u2014 not only their life \u2014 is threatened. Abortion foes, who say Trump has been a strong ally for them, want the president to highlight not just abortion-rights legislation but also renewed efforts by Democrats to remove the federal Hyde restrictions on when taxpayer dollars may be used for abortions. \u201cI think it is a good opportunity to highlight true extremism on the issue,\u201d said Tom McClusky, a lobbyist for March for Life. \u201cWhat is in the Democratic platform and in these bills is the very definition of extremism.\u201d 4. Paid family leave. Trump called for paid family leave in his State of the Union address last year. Since then, his daughter Ivanka\u00a0has worked with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on a bill allowing new parents to secure\u00a0paid leave by drawing from their Social Security benefits. Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) has worked on similar legislation in the House. Supporters of a voter-approved measure to fully expand Medicaid in Utah rally at the state Capitol in Salt Lake Cityto urge\u00a0lawmakers not to change the law. (Rick Bowmer\/AP) AHH: The Utah state Senate has passed a bill limiting the Medicaid expansion voters approved three months ago.\u00a0Voters had approved\u00a0Proposition 3\u00a0to expand Medicaid to low-income Utahns earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty rate. But in\u00a0a 22-to-7 vote, state senators passed a Republican-backed bill \u201csending to the House a replacement Medicaid expansion plan that initially costs considerably more money to cover fewer people than the voter-approved Proposition 3,\u201d the Salt Lake Tribune\u2019s Benjamin Wood reports. This bill instead\u00a0expands\u00a0coverage to residents earning up to 100 percent of the poverty rate but repeals the Medicaid expansion if the state doesn't obtain a waiver from the federal government. State lawmakers are hotly debating whether permission will be granted by\u00a0the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which hasn't yet approved a partial Medicaid expansion. The plan will also cost more to implement, at least initially. \u201cSenate leaders last week acknowledged that their plan would initially be more expensive to implement than Proposition 3,\u201d Benjamin writes. \u201cBut those costs would ultimately drop, they argued, once the federal government signs off on the state\u2019s changes and agrees to pay 90 percent of Utah\u2019s Medicaid costs.\u201d The bill goes next to the Utah House, where leaders have expressed support for replacing Prop 3. Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of The Fairness Project, which helped fund\u00a0expansion efforts in multiple states called the bill \"a slap in the face to Utahns who voted for full Medicaid expansion in their state...Utahns voted for more healthcare and more tax dollars brought home.\" People stand in line to\u00a0recharge Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits or apply for new benefits in 2017 at the Taylor Street Service Center in Washington. (Jason Andrew for The Washington Post) OUCH: There are 13 million people living in poverty in the United States who get no help from food stamps or other nutrition programs, child-care assistance, subsidized housing, or cash benefits, our Post colleague Tracy Jan reports, citing a new Urban Institute analysis.  That\u2019s a quarter of people living in poverty, with incomes less than $25,100 a year for a family of four, who are disconnected from the reach of social safety net programs, she writes. And among families of four making less than $13,000 a year, almost a third receive no such benefits. \u201cBlack Americans are most likely to receive assistance, with 85 percent of those in poverty receiving at least one form of aid,\u201d Tracy writes. \u201cHispanics and Asians are least likely, with 66 and 67 percent, respectively. Among whites, 70 percent receive at least one benefit.\u201d She adds research suggests there are many reasons some groups may receive more help than others, and studies have shown \u201clower-income white families have more resources to fall back on than lower-income nonwhite families.\u201d OOF: Senate Finance Committee Chairman\u00a0Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and the committee's top Democrat Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), have called on the executives of seven major pharmaceutical companies to testify before the panel at a hearing later this month.  The committee announced its second drug pricing hearing of the new Congress will be held on Feb. 26. At its first hearing last week, the pair expressed disappointment that many drug company executives had declined their invitations to testify. \u201cThe drugmakers are going to have to show up,\u201d Wyden said last week. \u201cThe companies that declined said they would discuss their ideas in private, but not in public,\u201d Grassley\u00a0said during the hearing. \u201cThat is not what I mean when I talk about transparency.\u201d The senators said Monday they invited AbbVie, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Pfizer and Sanofi to testify. \u201cPharmaceutical companies receive billions of dollars a year from federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid,\u201d Grassley and Wyden said in a statement. \u201cThis is an opportunity for companies that produce life-saving treatments to explain how they price these treatments and whether the status quo is acceptable. Patients and taxpayers deserve to hear from leaders in the industry about what\u2019s behind this unsustainable trend and what can be done to lower costs.\u201d President Trump speaks during his 2018 State of the Union address. (Brendan Smialowski\/AFP\/Getty Images) \u2014 The White House released a list of 13 guests invited\u00a0by President Trump and first lady Melania Trump to attend the State of the Union. Among the list is Matthew Charles, the first prisoner released as a result of the First Step Act, the bipartisan criminal-justice-reform bill the president signed into law in December. Charles was released after spending 35 years in prison for selling crack cocaine, the White House said. The White House also invited Ashley Evans, a woman who has struggled with opioid and substance abuse and later this month will celebrate more than a year in recovery. \u2014 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has invited\u00a0the activist who\u00a0confronted then-Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) about his support for the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Ana Maria Archila and another woman blocked the doors of an elevator on Capitol Hill to grill Flake about his support for Kavanaugh amid several allegations of sexual misconduct. \u201cThe women described themselves as survivors of sexual assault and tearfully urged Flake to reconsider his position,\u201d our colleague Elise Viebeck writes. \u201cThe encounter was carried live on CNN and became an iconic moment in the national controversy over Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination.\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), right, talks with Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam. (Mark Humphrey\/AP) \u2014 Today the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on how primary care affects health costs and outcomes. Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) will stress the importance of promoting overall patient wellness, keeping patients out of the emergency room and allowing patients to compare costs, in remarks shared in advance with The Health 202.\u00a0 \u201cI believe we can empower primary care doctors, nurse practitioners, and physicians assistants to go even a step further. Even if information on the cost and quality of health care is easily accessible, patients still have trouble comparing different health care options,\u201d Alexander is expected to say.\u00a0\u201cFor example, earlier this year, hospitals began to post their prices online, as required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, but to the average consumer, this information has proved to be incomprehensible.\u201d Live stream and witnesses here. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). (Win McNamee\/Getty Images) \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is calling on drugmaker Catalyst Pharmaceuticals to explain why it set a price of $375,000 a year for medication that\u2019s been available to patients free for years.  Sanders wrote\u00a0a\u00a0letter regarding the drug, Firdapse, used to treat rare autoimmune disorder Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). The Vermont senator called on the company to explain the financial and nonfinancial factors in\u00a0the decision to set the annual list price at $375,000, the average and median amount patients will pay for the drug out-of-pocket, and an estimate of how many patients will suffer or die as a result of the\u00a0list price. \"Until now, patients have been able to access an unapproved version of this drug for free through a Food and Drug Administration compassionate use program,\" Sanders writes to Catalyst chief executive Patrick J. McEnany. \u201cCatalyst\u2019s decision to set the annual price at $375,000 is not only a blatant fleeing of American taxpayers, but it is also an immoral exploitation of patients who need this medication,\u201d he added. \u201cI am profoundly concerned that Catalyst\u2019s actions will cause patients to suffer or die.\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. (Alex Brandon\/AP) \u2014 In remarks at a health-care conference, HHS Secretary Alex Azar suggested hospitals can do more to help patients understand the list price information they are now required to make available online.  As of the beginning of the year, a new policy requires all hospitals to post their list prices online in a move by the Trump administration to increase price transparency. But industry experts\u00a0warn the posted list prices won\u2019t necessarily help patients understand\u00a0their out-of-pocket costs.\u00a0 Azar seemed to dismiss those concerns, Modern Healthcare\u2019s Robert King reports.\u00a0\"To the extent that hospital list prices aren't useful information to the patients they serve, well, hospitals are the ones in the best position to do something about that,\" Azar said. A one-month dosage of hormonal birth control pills. (Rich Pedroncelli\/AP) \u2014 There was a rush of women seeking long-acting reversible birth control following\u00a0the 2016 presidential election, a new study has found. \u00a0 \u201cThe study, which only looked at women enrolled in commercial health insurance, found a 21.6 percent increase in the insertion rates of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods among women ages 18-45 in the 30 days after President Trump was elected,\u201d the New York Times\u2019s Christina Caron reports.\u00a0\u201cWhen the researchers examined the 30 days before and after the election, and compared it to the same time period in 2015, they found that an additional 2.1 IUDs or implants inserted per 100,000 women per day were associated with the election.\u201d The study's authors suggest\u00a0the increase could be related to\u00a0concerns about whether the Affordable Care Act, which requires insurers to cover 18 types of contraception, would be repealed during the Trump administration.\u00a0 Christina points out, however, the motivation of the women who acquired the implants was not part of the survey. But here\u2019s how lead study author and Harvard Medical School assistant professor of medicine Lydia Pace put it: \u201cWas there something else that happened that could account for that rise? Not that I know of.\u201d Today From The Post's Fact Checker: What Trump did and didn't get done from his 2018 State of the Union proposals:\u00a0 Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) denied\u00a0a sexual assault allegation from 2004 raised in an online report:","164":"On Election Day 2016, Los Angeles venture capitalist and Democratic donor Imaad Zuberi took to Facebook to tout his proximity to the person he thought would be ascending to the White House. \u201cThe next president of the United States of America Hillary Clinton,\u201d Zuberi wrote next to a photo of himself with a beaming Hillary Clinton, whose presidential bid he had backed with more than $600,000. When she lost to Donald Trump, he rapidly adjusted. In December, Zuberi stopped by the president-elect\u2019s offices at Trump Tower in New York in the company of a delegation of Qatari dignitaries. The following month, he donated $900,000 to the president\u2019s inaugural committee and $100,000 to help pay off lingering debt from the 2016 Republican National Convention. In February 2017, he posted a photo of himself at a restaurant near Mar-a-Lago with then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Zuberi\u2019s rapid transformation from one of Clinton\u2019s biggest fundraisers into a major Trump booster has drawn the attention of federal prosecutors in New York, who have homed in on the investor as part of a probe into the president\u2019s inaugural committee. A sweeping subpoena served on the committee this week seeks a wide range of information, including any documents related to foreign contributors. Separately, the subpoena specifically sought all communications related to Zuberi and his firm, Avenue Ventures. The exact nature of prosecutors\u2019 interest in Zuberi is unclear. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment. The inquiry has put a spotlight on a prolific donor with extensive foreign ties \u2014 particularly in the Middle East \u2014 who has doled out millions to politicians over the past 15 years, according to campaign finance records. Zuberi, who has plastered his Facebook page with pictures of himself with major political figures such as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, largely backed candidates on the left before Trump\u2019s election. With his wife, Willa Rao, he donated more than $2\u00a0million to Democratic candidates and committees between 2004 and 2016, sums that put him in the upper echelon of fundraisers for Obama and Hillary Clinton. Since Trump\u2019s election, the couple\u2019s giving has flipped: They have contributed $1.78\u00a0million to Republicans and just $206,000 to Democrats, records show. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the only person in the Hillary world and the Obama world to be in both of them and then move as quickly to Trump,\u201d said one Democratic fundraiser who knows Zuberi and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation. \u201cIt does make you wonder why he would do that and what he was trying to show.\u201d In an interview, Zuberi said he does not know why prosecutors would be interested in his interactions with Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. He said he has had no contact with authorities, adding that he was surprised to learn in news reports that his name was in the subpoena. Zuberi said he has always supported politicians in both parties, with an emphasis on candidates who he believes will boost the economy and support American exports. \u201cI\u2019m not giving based on party,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m giving based on people.\u201d But Zuberi was candid about his view that he sees a history of political giving as a way for those without powerful connections to open doors, saying that some day he may want to be an ambassador or receive a government appointment. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you pick up the phone or you pick up your checkbook and just start doing it two weeks before. You have to build a track record, right?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not coming from a political family like the Kennedys or the Kerry family, where just my name will open doors. I have to give donations.\u201d Among those whom he has supported is Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who received nearly $30,000 in donations from Zuberi and his wife between 2013 and 2017, campaign finance records show. Zuberi posted a photo on Facebook of himself with Engel and President Obama in August 2016. Tim Mulvey, an aide to Engel, said that Zuberi asked Engel in 2017 to meet with the Qatari foreign minister \u2014 a request that coincided with a similar request from the Qatari Embassy in Washington. Engel met with the foreign minister in November 2017, Mulvey said. \u201cSuch requests and meetings are routine for members of the Foreign Affairs Committee,\u201d he said. Steve Rabinowitz, a spokesman for Zuberi, said the investor has no recollection of requesting such a meeting. \u201cAround what looks like the time of this meeting, Imaad was seeking lots of connections for the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar,\u201d he said, noting that the Qatari foreign minister is the head of the fund. \u201cHe has no recollection of this particular request but made other requests like it, but never of a government official.\u201d Zuberi\u2019s decision to support Trump came quickly after the election, and he said he initially offered to donate $250,000 to the 2017 inaugural committee. But Zuberi said he was told the sum would not get him tickets to all the receptions, balls and other events, which he said he was eager to attend, in part so he could network with the new president\u2019s New York real estate associates. He agreed to increase his donation to $1\u00a0million, with $900,000 for the inaugural committee and $100,000 for the convention fund. \u201cSlowly, I was encouraged into giving, or driven into giving more,\u201d he said. Only American citizens or legal permanent residents are permitted to contribute to a presidential inaugural committee. Federal prosecutors, including special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, have been exploring for months whether foreign money was routed through U.S. citizens into efforts to support Trump. Zuberi noted that he has ties with business and political leaders in many countries but said he did not serve as a straw donor. \u201cIt\u2019s not foreign money. It\u2019s my money,\u201d he said. Zuberi, 48, was born in Pakistan and migrated with his parents to the United States when he was 3 years old, eventually becoming a naturalized citizen. He grew up in Albany, N.Y., where he said he became interested in politics by the time he was in his early teens. He moved to Los Angeles to attend the University of Southern California, where he said he was both an undergraduate and graduate student. In 1996, he served in the U.S. Army for about six months before being honorably discharged because of a knee injury, according to Rabinowitz. Zuberi said he got his start in business working for the Transamerica insurance company in locations such as Japan, Dubai, Hong Kong and Singapore. He eventually set up Avenue Ventures, a firm specializing in venture capital, private equity and other investments. According to a biography provided by his spokesman, Zuberi has \u201cclosed over $55\u00a0billion in transactions\u201d at the company. Zuberi said that most of the firm\u2019s clients \u2014 whom he declined to name \u2014 are from California, while others are abroad, including a number in Bahrain and other nations in the Persian Gulf region. Zuberi \u201chas deep contacts in the Middle East and on the [Indian] subcontinent and apparently used these contacts to work business deals in the United States and in the Middle East, according to what he described,\u201d said retired Gen. Wesley Clark, the former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and a 2004 Democratic presidential candidate. Zuberi\u2019s company hired Clark to help restructure a bankrupt hotel in Bahrain in 2013. Zuberi also serves as an economic adviser to the Chinese government, according to his biography. And in 2015 he registered as a lobbyist for the government of Sri Lanka \u2014 a role that drew scrutiny from the Justice Department, which investigated whether his work violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act, Foreign Policy magazine reported that year. No public action was taken. Zuberi said that as far as he knew, nothing came of the matter. At the time, Zuberi was emerging as a major fundraiser for Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. Internal campaign memos released by WikiLeaks show that Clinton staffers noted the Foreign Policy piece as a possible red flag in a memo prepared for campaign chairman John Podesta before he was set to meet with Zuberi in September 2015 to thank him for his support. Podesta did not respond to a request for comment. Zuberi said he ended up at the Trump Tower one day in December 2016 by happenstance. That morning, he said, he met with a delegation from Qatar to discuss a possible investment in a new real estate fund in New York he was trying to launch. Learning that the group was headed to meet with Trump aides, Zuberi said he offered to walk with them to the meeting and ended up riding with them in the elevator at Trump Tower before leaving the group. On the elevator, Rabinowitz said Zuberi ran into incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn and took a selfie with him in an encounter that lasted seconds. Zuberi then took the elevator back to the lobby and left the building, he said. The Qataris subsequently met with Flynn and Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon. \u201cI met nobody,\u201d Zuberi said. \u201cI was an insignificant person there.\u201d In the days following the Trump Tower meeting, Zuberi indicated on Facebook that he visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Zuberi said that during Trump\u2019s inauguration, he spoke with Trump\u2019s then-personal attorney Michael Cohen about potentially investing in the same real estate fund he had pitched to the Qataris. But he said that the idea for the fund fizzled and that no money changed hands.","165":"THE PROGNOSIS Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D). (Don Ryan\/AP) States that expanded their Medicaid health insurance programs are hunting for ways to fund the new enrollees in 2020\u00a0as they face a final drop in federal contributions. The federal government will still cover the bulk of the costs of care for the roughly 13 million Americans newly eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which allowed states to expand the program to people earning somewhat above the federal poverty level. But the gradually decreasing federal contribution \u2014\u00a0originally set at 100 percent but reduced to 90 percent starting next year \u2014 has left some states with budget holes to fill. Yesterday, the Oregon House approved a measure backed by Gov. Kate Brown (D) to help fund the state\u2019s Medicaid program, which faces a $950 million shortfall. The bill would extend new taxes on hospitals and insurance plans for an additional six years, which some lawmakers say will give them more time to come up with long-term health-care dollars. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R)\u00a0signed legislation over the summer earmarking 5 percent of new profits from the sale of liquor for Medicaid expansion, so no direct taxpayer dollars would need to be redirected. Around the same time, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D)\u00a0approved two new taxes paid by hospitals to fund that state\u2019s new expanded Medicaid program. California, Louisiana, Arizona, Colorado, Indiana and Minnesota have also implemented higher taxes either on health providers or insurers, or on the sale of alcohol or cigarettes, according to a tally by Governing Magazine. North Dakota cut payment rates to Medicaid providers. Several states, including Kentucky and Arkansas, have pursued charging premiums and implementing\u00a0work requirements to make up shortfalls. Many other states are paying for expansion out of their general fund revenue. \"We kinda had several groups,\" said John Hicks, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers.\u00a0\"States who didn\u2019t do anything special\u00a0on the revenue side, states who combined their regular funds with some new funds and some states \u2014\u00a0I think of Indiana \u2014 where no state general funds are devoted to Medicaid\u00a0expansion.\"\u00a0 New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu. (Elizabeth Frantz\/Concord Monitor\/AP) Republican governors in the 14 holdout states that have refused to expand Medicaid have faced criticism for leaving so much federal money on the table \u2014 an offer so generous that writers of the ACA never considered states would want to opt out. And some policy experts have found that a number of states actually experienced a reduction in overall state expenditures\u00a0because having more residents able to access timely, affordable care eases the\u00a0need for other social safety net programs. \u201cThe strong balance of objective evidence indicates that actual costs to states so far from expanding Medicaid are negligible or minor, and that states across the political spectrum do not regret their decisions to expand Medicaid,\u201d wrote Mark Hall, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Yet the Medicaid program overall consumes the single largest portion of state budgets, accounting for 29 percent of their total spending on average, according to NASBO. States spent $10.3 billion on expansion in the 2018 fiscal year, up from $6.7 billion the year prior. Hicks told me the budget outlook for many states improved significantly last year with the economic recovery. He stressed that states are keeping their eyes \u201cwide open\u201d on potential future fiscal pressures of adding more people to the health insurance program. \u201cIt\u2019s a higher [Medicaid] population than previously,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like having more schoolchildren in the future, you\u2019ve got that same risk as to if a recession or an economic downturn hits.\u201d Underscoring future concerns around Medicaid spending, officials\u00a0for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released projections yesterday that Medicaid spending growth will average 6 percent annually over the next seven years as more aged and disabled enrollees enter the program. They also predicted Medicaid spending growth will accelerate this year \u2014 the first time since major parts of the ACA went into effect in 2014. That\u2019s due to\u00a0steps by Idaho, Maine, Nebraska, Utah and Virginia to expand Medicaid for the first time. (iStock) AHH: National projections\u00a0from CMS\u2019s Office of the Actuary also predict\u00a0health-care expenditures nationwide will increase by an average of 5.5 percent annually between 2018 and 2027, as our Post colleague Amy Goldstein writes. By 2027, the United States is expected to spend $5.96 trillion on health care, totaling 19.4 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. By that year, federal, state and local governments will be paying 47 percent of the nation's health-care costs, up from 45 percent currently. Without changes to federal health policy, the nation's\u00a0uninsured rate is expected to remain steady at around 10 percent. \"Aging baby boomers will consume an ever-larger share of the nation\u2019s health-care spending over the coming decade, regardless of the success of Democrats running for president with ambitious plans to broaden Medicare,\" Amy writes. \"The number of people covered through Medicare \u2014 and spending on the federal insurance program for older and disabled Americans \u2014 is expected to grow more rapidly than private insurance or Medicaid, eating up a larger chunk of health spending, according to a yearly forecast of U.S. health-care expenditures released Wednesday,\" she explains. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie. (Leah Millis\/Reuters) OOF: More than two dozen veterans' advocacy groups want Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie to stop GI Bill benefits from going to predatory colleges.\u00a0They point to an\u00a0audit that found negligent oversight could mean $2.3 billion in tuition benefits end up going to predatory schools in the next five years, our Post colleague Danielle Douglas-Gabriel reports. \u201cEducation funding earned by men and women who serve in the U.S. military has become a stable source of revenue for many colleges,\u201d Danielle writes. \u201cBut advocates say that some schools \u2014 especially for-profit colleges \u2014 have failed to provide high-quality education and that the federal government has shirked its responsibility to act.\u201d The VA can cut off these benefits to schools that employ deceptive marketing. The December audit from VA\u2019s inspector general \u201cfound millions of dollars going to for-profit colleges that violated VA standards by making misleading claims about their accreditation status or student outcomes.\u201d \"The aggressive recruiting practices of some for-profit colleges have been well-documented,\" Danielle writes. \"A 2012 Senate investigation found evidence of schools deploying teams at veterans hospitals and wounded-warrior centers to enroll students. Some recruiters misled or lied to veterans in telling them that their military benefits cover the full cost of tuition.\" Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. (Drew Angerer\/Getty Images) OUCH: Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the federal government may need to intervene if states continue to allow vaccine exemptions.  Referring to a recent measles outbreak\u00a0in the United States, Gottlieb told CNN that \u201csome states are engaging in such wide exemptions that they're creating the opportunity for outbreaks on a scale that is going to have national implications.\u201d He added that if \u201ccertain states continue down the path that they're on, I think they're going to force the hand of the federal health agencies.\u201d \u201cThe commissioner was vague on when he thought the federal government should take action and what exactly that action should be,\u201d CNN\u2019s Elizabeth Cohen and John Bonifield write. \u201cHe said he hoped that the measles outbreak would make state officials realize that they needed to get stricter on exemptions.\u201d \u2014\u00a0 The United States of Care, a group founded by Andy Slavitt, CMS acting administrator under President Obama,\u00a0launched a website and blueprint for implementing\u00a0a Medicaid buy-in program. Such a Medicaid-style plan has been touted\u00a0by Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who reintroduced a measure last week to let states sell government-backed Medicaid plans on their individual insurance marketplaces. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who has emerged as a centrist candidate among the growing list of Democratic presidential hopefuls, said during a CNN town hall this week that she\u00a0prefers a Medicaid-type plan to the more ambitious Medicare-for-all program touted by some of her 2020 rivals. \u201cHealth care costs are reaching a crisis point, and today too many Americans still don\u2019t have an affordable option for health insurance,\u201d Schatz said in a statement about the group\u2019s new playbook. \u201cA Medicaid public option will let states unlock the program for anyone who wants it, giving more people a high-quality, low-cost choice when purchasing health insurance. By providing a roadmap to success, United States of Care is empowering states to take bold action on health care.\u201d The group said the new site, MedicaidBuyIn.com, can provide a resource for policymakers and industry leaders who want to better understand the approach. \u00a0 Insulin supplies. (Carlo Allegri\/Reuters) \u2014 Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) introduced a bill that would allow patients to import insulin from Canada and other countries as a way to address skyrocketing costs of the life-saving diabetes treatment. \u201cPrices for insulin have gone through the roof and are hammering diabetes patients who cannot live without this life-saving medicine yet cannot afford to pay for it,\" Welch said\u00a0while\u00a0introducing the bill. \"This commonsense legislation bypasses Big Pharma's pricing monopoly by making available to patients safe, lower-cost insulin.\u201d Patients would still need a prescription to acquire the medication and could still be eligible for insurance coverage. The bill would allow patients, pharmacists and wholesalers to import cheaper insulin from Canada for two years and then would expand to other countries after that, mandating that the Food and Drug Administration certify and inspect all foreign exporters of insulin. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. (Ricardo Ramirez Buxeda\/Orlando Sentinel via AP) \u2014 Meanwhile, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) announced he wants to allow the state to import cheaper medications from Canada as a way to lower health-care costs.\u00a0 He said during a news conference at a retirement community that Trump\u00a0supports the idea. The governor plans to ask state lawmakers to pass a bill to\u00a0authorize such imports,\u00a0the Miami Herald's\u00a0Emily L. Mahoney and Elizabeth Koh report. After that, the federal government will still need to give approval, which hasn't happened since a law mandating the process passed in 2003.\u00a0 \"Once we get this in place, U.S. citizens will be able to have access to more affordable drugs,\" DeSantis said. He added: \"I want you to know I spoke personally to President Trump both Sunday and Monday about this...He\u2019s not only supportive, he\u2019s enthusiastic.\u201d \"DeSantis said this program would make Florida the first state to take advantage of a provision of the federal Medicare Modernization Act,\" they write. \"Until now, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has 'continually refused' to authorize states to bring in drugs from Canada, but President Donald Trump has assured him that will change, DeSantis said.\" \u2014 AIDS United has launched a six-figure ad campaign that calls on the Trump administration to follow through on Trump's State of the Union pledge to end HIV transmissions by 2030 by withdrawing the proposed Medicare Part D rule. The organization argues the rule would limit patient access to life-saving HIV treatment. The proposed change to Medicare\u2019s prescription drug benefit could allow Part D insurance plans to refuse to cover some drugs that are in six \"protected classes\" that until now were required to be covered comprehensively. The categories\u00a0include\u00a0HIV\/AIDS patients. \u201cWe are encouraged by the President's call to end HIV transmissions by 2030; however, this goal is achievable only with hard work and the appropriate investment of resources,\u201d Jesse Milan Jr., AIDS United president and chief executive,\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cWe urge Secretary Azar and President Trump to honor their new commitment by addressing all issues related to HIV prevention, care, and treatment.

Guaid\u00f3 declared himself interim president, calling for new elections \u2014 and quickly garnered the support of the United States, Canada, most of the European Union and a dozen Latin American nations. Absent from that list are two countries with major financial interests in Venezuela: China and Russia. It has been a tale of two creditors, each with a concentrated financial exposure to Venezuela yet distinct foreign policy aims. Our research, reflected in two recently published Wilson Center reports, examines these differences in Chinese-Venezuelan and Russian-Venezuelan economic relations. Here\u2019s what you need to know: 1. For China, oil ties mean Beijing has to be pragmatic about nonintervention.  On the eve of the global financial crisis, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and President Hu Jintao laid the foundations of the China-Venezuela state-to-state relationship when they crafted their first loans-for-oil deals in 2007. Ch\u00e1vez was able to court a creditor to help expand the Venezuelan state. For Beijing, Venezuela\u2019s abundant natural resources and energy supplies could help China secure long-term access to these vital national assets. By 2014, China\u2019s main policy bank, the China Development Bank (CDB), had provided the Venezuelan government with more than $30 billion in new oil-backed loans. They had mainly supported investment in the energy and mining sectors, including power stations, oil refineries and pipelines. However, the initial discretionary nature of these policy bank loans also meant that Venezuela used the proceeds for infrastructure projects in a variety of other sectors, including agriculture, telecommunications, housing and forestry. China\u2019s policy banks hoped to avoid the failings of other creditors in Latin America by circumventing the need for policy conditionality with commercial conditions. Beijing used loans-for-oil deals, wagering that the production capacity of Venezuela\u2019s state oil company (PDVSA) was a sufficient guarantee for debt repayment. This was a miscalculation. China overestimated Venezuela\u2019s ability to sustain oil production and, hence, economic activity, but also its ability to successfully manage several commercial projects that were spread across broad sectors of the economy. China thus paid a high cost when Venezuela fell into arrears on its oil collateral and failed to finance transportation projects in 2014 amid the country\u2019s worsening economic crisis and historic oil sector collapse. As Venezuela\u2019s economy worsened, China grew cautious With China\u2019s loans tied to oil production, China\u2019s policy banks were compelled to lend defensively \u2014 rolling over about $9 billion of existing bilateral funds \u2014 in the hope of boosting Venezuela crude output and recovering their oil collateral. But Beijing also grew reluctant to extend any new financial arrangements, as China became more circumspect about Maduro\u2019s ability to manage the economy. At its peak, between 2010 and 2013, Venezuela accounted for an average of 64 percent of China\u2019s new approved lines of credit to Latin America. But from 2014 to 2017, Venezuela represented 18 percent of China\u2019s total new lines of credit to the region. China\u2019s strategy revolves around a pragmatic commitment to \u201cnonintervention,\u201d protecting its considerable financial commitments by hedging politically as well as commercially. Chinese leaders courted Venezuela\u2019s opposition leaders during the 2012 presidential and the 2015 parliamentary elections. Guaid\u00f3 representatives reportedly met with Chinese officials last week to discuss Venezuela\u2019s $20 billion outstanding debt to China. Guaid\u00f3 has sought to build on this diplomatic momentum, saying that China\u2019s \u201csupport will be very important in boosting our country\u2019s economy and future development.\u201d In Beijing, a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seemed to reciprocate, saying, \u201cNo matter how the situation evolves, China-Venezuela cooperation should not be undermined.\u201d 2. Russia is looking to boost both its geopolitical and economic capital Beginning in 2015, as China grew more cautious and concerned about its exposure in Venezuela, Russia provided about $6.5 billion in new funds through its state-owned enterprise, Rosneft, to Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company. Previously, the cornerstone of the Russia-Venezuelan relationship had been military ties, with Venezuela buying more than $4 billion in Russian arms and military equipment. By financially backing the Maduro regime, Russia seized an opportunity to signal its return to the global and hemispheric stage with a symbolic move in Venezuela, a country in close U.S. proximity. Moscow also demonstrated to its hemispheric allies, such as Cuba and Nicaragua, that it could both exercise Latin American influence and challenge U.S. geopolitical interests. In the wake of Guaid\u00f3\u2019s political ascension, Russia drafted a U.N. resolution expressing \u201cits concerns over threats to use force\u201d against Venezuela. Russia fired a rhetorical shot across the U.S.\u2019s foreign policy bow, warning that \u201cthe cynical, overt interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state\u201d must stop. Venezuela\u2019s military, an ongoing supporter of the Maduro regime, has relied on Russia for military equipment \u2014 circumventing U.S. sanctions. Russia\u2019s motivations were largely political The guiding principles of Russia\u2019s involvement in the oil and gas sectors are also mostly political rather than commercial. In a recent Wilson Center report, analyst Vladimir Rouvinski suggests that Russian political elites \u201csincerely believe there is an opportunity to improve the situation sometime in the future with Chavistas still in control of Venezuela.\u201d Russia\u2019s state-owned enterprises emerged as key investors at a time when the Maduro government found it increasingly difficult to secure new credit from anywhere, including China. Rosneft and Gazprom, Russia\u2019s energy giants, provided valued short-term financing to Venezuela\u2019s crumbling oil-state company (PDVSA). In exchange, PDVSA provided 49.9 percent of its total shares from its U.S. subsidiary, Citgo, as collateral to Rosneft to guarantee future payments. Furthermore, Rosneft has increased in equity stake in the Orinoco\u2019s heavy oil belt joint venture and has also received access to the largest gas reserves in Venezuela. But Moscow appears to be learning from China\u2019s Venezuelan hedge by diversifying its strategic hand beyond the geopolitical card. Facing mounting financial arrears, vulnerable supply chains, U.S. court battles over Citgo shares used as loan collateral, and U.S. sanctions on the Rosneft CEO, there are limits to how far Rosneft can extend its financial exposure in Venezuela. Rosneft is Russia\u2019s largest oil producer and second-largest gas-producing firm \u2014 this means Russia has to protect the company\u2019s commercial interests. Recently, Russia appears to be counterbalancing the tough geopolitical rhetoric with a softer push, saying, \u201cThe only way out of this crisis is for the government and opposition to sit down for negotiations.\u201d Notwithstanding ongoing uncertainty regarding Venezuela\u2019s political future, it is clear that both China and Russia plan to be a part of Venezuela\u2019s economic future.

On \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday night, Schultz expressed his frustration with the state of the two major parties and explained he is considering running as an independent next year. The reaction to Schultz\u2019s entry, meanwhile, has been decidedly lukewarm, if not hostile. At his first campaign event on Monday evening, a heckler shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire,\u201d adding an expletive for emphasis. While the debate over Schultz \u2019s possible impact on the 2020 election will continue to rage in coming weeks, more important right now \u2014 with a man who has a big ego and a big wallet already in the White House \u2014 is to explain what accounts for the growing number of American chief executives who say they can make what seems to them to be a lateral move to chief executive of the U.S. government. The phenomenon has become very real in the past few years. While Ross Perot was considered a curiosity when he ran as an independent in 1992 and 1996, brand-name business figures no longer seem unusual in presidential politics. In this election cycle alone, Schultz, Michael Bloomberg, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Steyer, Mark Zuckerberg and Mark Cuban have all been floated as potential challengers to Trump. Name recognition, an apparent record of success in business and personal resources were enough for Trump, these candidates seem to say, so why wouldn\u2019t it be enough for them? Trump spent $66.1 million of his own money on his 2016 campaign. For billionaires with a bigger bottom line and a larger sense of themselves, such a price seems a bargain too good to ignore. But while we only now have a plague of big-ego billionaires in politics, the conditions that gave rise to the trend date back to the 1970s. In the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, many voters soured on \u201cexperienced\u201d politicians who had betrayed their trust. Liberal Democrats felt President Lyndon B. Johnson had done them wrong when he channeled his political capital away from domestic reform and into a disastrous war in Vietnam. Republicans were likewise devastated when they learned about the ugly underbelly of presidential power as a result of Watergate. During the next four decades, the \u201coutsider\u201d became the most sought-after identity for presidential candidates. Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter led the way in 1976 when he made his weak ties to Washington a claim to fame. As his opponents in the Democratic primary boasted of their decades of experience in Washington, and President Gerald Ford campaigned from the Rose Garden, Carter boasted to voters that he was one of them. With Carter\u2019s victory, the message was clear: Being an outsider was in. Originally, the outsider label was used to burnish the candidacies of leaders who, like Carter, had led governments at the state level: California\u2019s Ronald Reagan, Arkansas\u2019 Bill Clinton, Texas\u2019s George W. Bush. But in recent decades, when even state-level leaders seem tainted by politics as usual, the outsider status has been embraced by those who are truly outside politics, like former pro wrestler Jesse Ventura or film star Arnold Schwarzenegger, who both won races for governor. In a conservative era that celebrates the virtues of free markets and private enterprise, who could be a better outsider than the business executive turned candidate? The rising tide of wealthy candidates is also a direct result of an important Supreme Court decision. Two years after Congress reformed the campaign finance system in response to the revelations of Watergate, the Supreme Court undid some of the changes in the 1976 ruling in Buckley v. Valeo. The Court maintained some of the new limits on campaign spending, primarily for those who accepted public funds, but it also ruled that candidates had the right to spend unlimited amounts of their own money on their own campaigns. The decision gave wealthy candidates a tremendous advantage: They could spend as much of their own fortunes, as they wanted as long as they didn\u2019t accept any public funds. Self-funded campaigns had the ironic consequence of letting wealthy elites present themselves as populist champions. In 1988, for instance, Democratic businessman Herbert Kohl ran for a Senate seat in Wisconsin with a motto that promised he would be beholden only to the voters: \u201cNobody\u2019s Senator but yours.\u201d Numerous governors such as David Walters in Oklahoma and Kirk Fordice in Mississippi likewise came to office directly from the boardroom. In 2019, when the cost of campaigns has reached astronomical levels, extremely rich business leaders \u2014 who have thrived in the era of growing inequality \u2014 want to be part of the political action. The phenomenon has also been fueled by the new media ecosystem that started to take form in the 1970s. Cable television transformed the news business in significant ways, first with the launch of the original Cable News Network (CNN) in 1980 and the dawn of 24-hour-a-day news cycles and, later, with the rise of staunchly partisan news networks like Fox News, which began in 1996. At the same time, the Internet produced an endless number of sites devoted to coverage of Washington as well as new forms of social media like Facebook (2004) and Twitter (2006) that offered an incessant feed of political news. In short order, a political-media news complex took form that churned out election-related news 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. The result has been an ongoing search for content. Producers, reporters, editors and bloggers all need breaking news to keep the attention of their audiences. This creates a ready-made platform for high-profile business executives who merely say about entering a presidential election. Rich celebrities and whether they might run for office make for good cable segments: Will they run? How would they do? What factors might go into their decision? (Never mind whether they\u2019re actually even serious about pursuing it.) Ross Perot was one of the first to discover the opportunities the new media landscape created. He announced his candidacy during an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cLarry King Live,\u201d then promoted his policies with half-hour paid advertisements on television. The cost of such ads \u2014 estimated at the time as between $150,000 to $700,000 each \u2014 made them prohibitive for most candidates, but Perot\u2019s fortune allowed him to use them to reach as many as 16.5 million viewers at a time. We have created these opportunities at the expense of a value once considered essential in elections: political experience. We have thrown out the idea that having worked in government and demonstrated one\u2019s qualifications in a lower-level elected office is one of the best measures to see how a person will handle the awesome responsibilities that come with the Oval Office. We have confused wealth and fame in the private sector with the qualifications that are needed for those who hold public office. Perhaps the experience the nation is now having with the first wealthy business outsider to win the presidency will cause voters \u2014 and would-be candidates \u2014 to rethink the idea that anyone who has the means to run for office should do so.

There was a close, controversial election, full of rancor and anger. There were a lot of wealthy men talking about \u201cthe people\u201d and their \u201cwill.\u201d There were targeted advertising campaigns, stolen data and fake social media accounts. But now, with only a few days left until Britain is due to face the consequences of that vote, the Brexit story suddenly looks even more familiar: One of its protagonists turns out to have much deeper Russian business connections than previously suspected. He also tried to conceal them. Some of it, he says, comes from an insurance company he owns. Some comes, supposedly, from \u201cdiamond mines.\u201d All of it is spread among dozens of companies based in Gibraltar, the British Virgin Islands and the Isle of Man, according to documents revealed in the Panama Papers, among other things, as well as Britain. Although he has testified that none of the money used in funding the campaign came from foreign sources \u2014 which would be illegal \u2014 the British electoral commission found his stories suspicious enough to ask the National Crime Agency to investigate. Banks also seems to have been very friendly with some foreigners who also believed that Brexit was in their national interest. Last summer, the Guardian reported that the Russian ambassador to Britain had offered him a tantalizing and peculiarly lucrative investment in Russian gold mines; Banks declared categorically that he would never invest in Russia: \u201cNo. Flat. Zero. Nothing,\u201d he replied when asked directly by Channel 4\u00a0News. This  week the broadcaster\u2019s reporters alleged that a finance company substantially owned by Banks did pursue the deal \u2014 and even identified a shell company, based in Sweden, that could be used to pursue it. Because Banks still denies that the deal happened, and because the story is so hard to follow further, we won\u2019t know the truth before March 29, when Britain is scheduled to leave the E.U. But even if this story won\u2019t delay Brexit, it does firmly locate the referendum within a larger context. The truth is that Britain has become a place where untransparent money, from unknown sources, is widely accepted with a complacent shrug. London is the world capital of offshore banking, home to the most sophisticated accountants and lawyers; a third of British billionaires have availed themselves of those services and moved their money beyond the reach of the state, according to a report Thursday in the Times of London. Many of them nevertheless continue to make donations to British political parties, and many continue to lobby to keep the rules that favor them exactly as they are. As a result, the British political class does not have the willpower to force them to bring their money home. The British state does not have the legal tools to force Banks to show where his cash came from. The British media continue to investigate, but if anyone were trying to influence the British referendum campaign from outside the country \u2014 beyond the social media manipulation that is now de rigueur in almost every election \u2014 it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll never know. And here\u2019s the final irony: If Brexit was the creation, in part, of this new world of offshore money and political influence campaigns, Brexit may well ensure that it continues unrestricted. The E.U. is probably the only power in Europe \u2014 maybe even the only one in the world \u2014 with the regulatory strength to change the culture of tax avoidance. And since 2016, it has been slowly enacting rules designed to do exactly that. Britain, once it leaves the E.U., may well be exempt. British industry might suffer after Brexit, and British power will be reduced. But the gray zone \u2014 where politics meets money, where foreign money can become domestic, where assets can be hidden and connections concealed \u2014 will survive. Perhaps that was the point all along. Read more from Anne Applebaum\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook. Read more: Robert J.

Cohen also mentioned a whole bunch of people who would have evidence of Trump\u2019s alleged crimes and lies, The list includes Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump, Jr. and Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. The Post reports that Democrats have every intention of following up on Cohen\u2019s leads: A House Intelligence Committee aide said that the panel anticipates bringing in for an interview Allen Weisselberg, Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer, but did not name a date for when they planned to make that happen. And House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings said Thursday that any person Cohen named during public testimony the day before will \u201chave a good chance of hearing from us\u201d for \u201cat least an interview.\u201d \u201cAll you have to do is follow the transcript,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said. \u201cIf there were names that were mentioned, or records that were mentioned during the hearing, we want to take a look at all of that. .\u2009.\u2009. We\u2019ll go through, we\u2019ll figure out who we want to talk to, and we\u2019ll bring them in.\u201d And the Judiciary Committee also may get into the act. If this reminds you of the Senate Watergate hearings before the House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearings, you are not alone. It was in the former that we learned about a cast of characters and groups (the plumbers, CREEP), heard from former White House lawyer John Dean and watched Sen. Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) ask the iconic question, \u201cWhat did the president know, and when did he know it?\u201d That played on TV from February 1973 through June 1974 \u2014 just about the same period of time between now and the 2020 election. If you thought Cohen had a lot to say, wait for Weisselberg \u2014 who has been charged with no crime for the Republicans to holler about \u2014 to take the House members through checks, financial statements, phone conversations and the rest detailing Trump\u2019s finances. Judging from Cohen\u2019s testimony, it does not seem as though the Southern District of New York prosecutors have much of a problem with the House plowing over some of the same ground they have covered. In other words, way before moving on to consider the possibility of impeachment, there will be months of hearings laying out in public potential Trump crimes and assembling a list of Trump\u2019s lies. None of this, or very little, may touch on the Russia probe and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s final report. This, by the way, is why Trump and his cronies were so upset when Cohen\u2019s office and home were raided. No wonder Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is in no rush to move to impeachment. \u201cImpeachment is a divisive issue,\u201d she warned at her Thursday news conference. Why bother with something that will raise hackles and in all likelihood amount to nothing, given the Senate will not agree to remove Trump? Instead, Democrats can have a year or more of hearings to inform the voters what kind of character Trump is \u2014 while litigation on foreign emoluments, for example, delves into his foreign holdings and liabilities. Remember, provided that no statute of limitations has run out, federal and state crimes (for which a presidential pardon is unavailable) can be pursued after Trump leaves office. (State prosecutors, by the way, aren\u2019t bound by Justice Department guidelines on the indictment of a sitting president and could try indicting him for state crimes while Trump is in office.) There is no Justice Department guideline preventing prosecution of an entity such as the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign. So there could be some criminal cases filed before the election involving Trump. If Trump hasn\u2019t fled the scene with a Pence pardon in hand by the time he reaches the 2020 election, we may barely remember a time he was fixated on Mueller. Instead, voters may have been overwhelmed with a record of misdeeds and lies, which, if known at the time Trump ran in 2016, would have prevented him from getting elected in the first place. It will be clear for all but the Trump dead-enders that he has repeatedly lied to the American people. (Forget about state and federal authorities.) And we know from the Cohen hearing how much Republican congressmen hate liars. Democrats may be entirely content to let all of this unfold, leaving Trump and the GOP mortally wounded but not yet expired on Election Day 2020. It\u2019s all upside and no downside for Democrats to proceed this way, especially if they manage to keep moving forward substantive, popular legislation \u2014 including background checks, lowering prescription drug costs and school construction \u2014 as Pelosi detailed Thursday. Somehow, I don\u2019t imagine Pelosi is going to get sidetracked with impeachment proceedings, She\u2019s having too much fun winning. Read more: Randall D.

Mueller III to rescue them from their approaching train wreck. And they should be honest with themselves (if not the rest of us): They are heading for a political derailment if things go on as they have been. What\u2019s the jam? Republicans have a presidential incumbent whose most recent polls put him in the mid-30s. Even worse, the intensity of the opposition to him is off the charts. The Post-ABC poll tells us: A 56 percent majority of all Americans say they would \u201cdefinitely not vote for him\u201d should Trump become the Republican nominee, while 14 percent say they would consider voting for him and 28 percent would definitely vote for him. Majorities of independents (59 percent), women (64 percent) and suburbanites (56 percent) rule out supporting Trump for a second term. Across six polls during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, between 41 percent and 46 percent said they would \u201cdefinitely not vote for him.\u201d That includes an October 2011 poll in which Obama\u2019s approval rating sank to 42 percent, with disapproval at 54 percent. Obama won reelection in 2012 with 51 percent of the popular vote compared with Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s 47 percent. The depth and breadth of animosity are unlikely to dissipate even in the best of economic times. Should the economy stall out, as many economists expect will happen by 2020, even those Republicans in the \u201cBut taxes . . .\u201d or \u201cBut Gorsuch .\u2009.\u2009.\" camp may see the handwriting on the wall. Moreover, it\u2019s not like Republicans are all that jazzed about him. Sure, when a pollster asks Republicans if they approve of Trump\u2019s performance, a strong majority say they do, but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t recognize his unelectability in a year. To the contrary, in the Post-ABC poll already 32 percent of Republicans\/Lean Republicans would like the party to nominate someone else next year. But Republicans' prospects for an alternate nominee are sparse. Former senator Jeff Flake of Arizona says he\u2019s not running. The best shot for a Trump alternative at this stages is Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a representative of the shrinking sane wing of the GOP. (He, by the way, is smart to consider a run: If the bottom drops out of Trump\u2019s support, he might be the only available lifeboat.) And that\u2019s where we come back to Mueller. Regardless of the inappropriate comments of acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker (whose meandering, nervous remarks at a Monday news conference suggested Mueller was nearing the end of his investigation), we have no idea how far along Mueller really is. We don\u2019t know if Whitaker (drenched in sweat and looking entirely uncomfortable in his role) was telling the truth, which part of the investigation (or all of it) might be wrapping up, and what \u201cclose to being completed\u201d really means. Whenever the report does come out, Mueller is unlikely to indict a sitting president given current Justice Department rules. Unless Mueller has Trump dead to rights on collusion (or the Southern District of New York has him on conspiracy to commit fraud and\/or violate campaign finance laws), a jaw-dropping obstruction case would be needed for Republican senators to abandon Trump. They may do so (in part because Trump is a weight around the necks of Senate incumbents), but no one \u2014 especially not GOP primary voters \u2014 should count on a knockout blow that would absolve them of the choice in the primary between a wounded Trump and some as-yet-unknown challenger. Flash forward to the primaries. On one side, in a wide open race with no obvious front-runner, 20 Democrats will be electrifying Democrats, boosting turnout and creating a tough, moving target for the Republican opposition machine. (Which of the 20 should it focus on? Do Republican smears even matter?) On the other side, in all likelihood you have a wounded president, growing unease among the base, a less-than-ideal economic record and \u2014 if Republicans are lucky \u2014 a decent challenger or two who will pound away at Trump\u2019s faults. This sure doesn\u2019t look like 1984 or 1996 or even 2004 when an incumbent president had a clear advantage. No, 2020 may look a lot like 1976 \u2014 or, worse for the GOP, 1976 with Nixon still in the White House. As I said, Republicans should be very, very nervous.

The mounting worries prompted the bank to cut its growth forecast for 2019 by nearly one-third to just above 1 percent. ECB President Mario Draghi also said he would maintain rock-bottom interest rates through the end of this year, several months longer than previously planned, and funnel more credit to banks in hopes of spurring business lending. The move came less than three months after European authorities said the 19-nation euro zone economy no longer needed unusual help, capping  more than a decade-long $3 trillion stimulus following the global financial crisis. Thursday\u2019s about-face sounded alarms about a global slowdown that caught officials off guard. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly significant move,\u201d said Adam Tooze, a Columbia University historian and author of \u201cCrashed,\u201d a history of recent financial crises. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to the anemic quality of Europe\u2019s recovery and the [failures] of the ECB that we\u2019ve had to go through this roller coaster.\u201d For now, the United States remains an island of relative stability, though Federal Reserve officials in recent days have voiced concerns that the economic expansion could be fraying. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 200 points or nearly 1\u00a0percent on the European announcement. Despite the accumulation of bad news, the global economy is still likely to grow this year. The bigger concern is that central banks like the ECB have little ammunition to fight a deeper downturn, whether triggered by events in Europe or elsewhere. European interest rates are already negative, meaning that banks actually pay authorities in Frankfurt to hold their deposits. In the United States, the Fed\u2019s benchmark lending rate is less than one-half what it was on the eve of the global financial crisis. So Chair Jerome H. Powell would have little room to cut rates to spur growth if a recession occurs. \u201cWhat\u2019s scary is this is the ECB signaling they are running out of ammo,\u201d said Adam Posen, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. \u201cIf we overshoot into a genuine recession, that\u2019s why I get genuinely freaked out.\u201d If that happens, European monetary authorities will have the greatest difficulty. The Federal Reserve and the People\u2019s Bank of China are in relatively better shape, he added. Fed officials have changed their thinking about how high interest rates should be when the economy is purring at an ideal pace, one that doesn\u2019t need to be accelerated or cooled down. Before the financial crisis, the\u00a0Fed believed that inflation-adjusted \u201cneutral\u201d rate was 3 percent. Today, it\u2019s probably around 1\u00a0percent. The likelihood that rates will often be lower than in the past \u2014 even when the economy is growing at its potential \u2014 \u201climits the amount of space available for cutting the federal fund rate to buffer the economy from adverse developments,\u201d Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors, said Thursday in a speech at Princeton University. If needed, the Fed could resume its bond purchases, known as quantitative easing. Along with such monetary tools, the United States could raise spending or cut taxes to fight rising unemployment. The Trump administration already cut taxes by $1.5 trillion in 2017, helping drive the national debt to nearly $22\u00a0trillion. So far, even as the public debt swells, financial markets have been willing to lend the government as much as it wants. Borrowing costs, measured by the 2.6\u00a0percent yield on the 10-year Treasury security, are less than one-half the 50-year average. Investors may not remain so sanguine indefinitely. For now, the economy is humming. Job growth in the United States remains robust, with employers hiring nearly 240,000 workers each month over the past year. Small businesses broke a 45-year-old record for job creation in February, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Brainard cited recent statistics on retail sales, consumer confidence and residential construction that suggested a \u201csoftening\u201d of economic activity. The economy in the first quarter has all but stalled, growing at an annual rate of just 0.5 percent, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s GDPNow forecast. Weakness abroad reverberates in the United States through lower orders for American exports and financial market volatility, she added. More than 40 percent of sales by companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, a key stock market benchmark, come from overseas. \u201cWe are more vulnerable than what people are suggesting,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank. Indeed, in Paris on Wednesday, Laurence Boone, chief economist for the 36-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, gave a downbeat assessment of the global outlook before cutting her forecasts for the global economy and every advanced nation. \u201cIt does not look very good,\u201d Boone said. \u201cGlobal growth looked really good in 2017 but it has slowed markedly since then.\u201d Her formal presentation carried a stark warning: \u201cVulnerabilities in China, Europe and financial markets could derail the global economy.\u201d Tensions from the trade war between the United States and China, along with uncertainty over the U.K.\u2019s planned Brexit, have sapped consumer and business confidence. China, where government leaders have been trying to wean the economy from its addiction to debt-fueled growth, also is slowing more sharply than had been anticipated. In the fourth quarter, world trade volume fell by 0.9 percent, its worst performance since 2009, according to the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis. The ECB\u2019s actions indicate that the authorities expect economic weakness to persist for at least a year, according to Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cThey\u2019re a little bit more worried than Dr. Draghi has let on,\u201d Weinberg told clients on a Thursday webinar. The global downturn reflects a buildup in business inventories and should be \u201cshort and shallow,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cAll recessions do not have to result in a financial crisis.\u201d Still, Dan Alpert, managing partner of Westwood Capital, said Europe\u2019s weakness will inevitably spill over into the United States and China. As the euro weakens, European customers won\u2019t be able to afford as many American or Chinese exports. \u201cThis is no way to run a global economy,\u201d Alpert said.","172":"In this edition: How Trump is painting Democrats, the emergency declaration and 2020, and how this time is different for Bernie Sanders. It's hard to believe some senators in the Democratic caucus aren't running, and this is The Trailer. PresidentTrump speaks about the crisis in Venezuela during a visit to Florida International University in Miami on Monday. (Kevin Lamarque\/Reuters) MIAMI\u00a0\u2014 It was a billed as an official event for President Trump to lay out his vision for addressing the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. But Trump\u2019s visit to Miami on Monday doubled as an unofficial campaign rally, complete with MAGA caps, \u201cTiny Dancer\u201d intro music, and a distinct message for domestic voters in the nation\u2019s largest swing state: Socialism is a failed system, and he is fighting those who want to bring it to the United States. \u201cSocialism is not about justice, it's not about equality, it's not about lifting up the poor,\u201d Trump said in a message that resonated among the mostly Hispanic crowd of Venezuelan American and Cuban American supporters. \u201cSocialism is about one thing only: power for the ruling class.\u00a0And the more power they get, the more they crave. They want to run health care, run transportation and finance, run energy, education \u2014 run everything.\u201d As Trump\u2019s reelection campaign gears up, he is on a mission to brand Democrats as socialists hellbent on turning the United States into Venezuela. The president is taking every opportunity he has \u2014 from official events to campaign messaging to Twitter \u2014 to label Democrats as far-left radicals with bankruptcy-inducing policy ideas.\u00a0With his approval ratings stubbornly stuck underwater, and with no signs he plans to pivot to the center, Trump\u2019s only path to reelection is to make his potential opponents seem as extreme and unfavorable as possible, said Amy Walter, national editor of the Cook Political Report. \u201cThe swing voters are not with him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe and his campaign will work to make the Democrat [nominee]\u00a0so unappealing that voters will have to make the best-worst choice.\u201d Trump\u2019s team has openly admitted that it hopes to tarnish Democrats during the primary process before candidates can define themselves. While Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who announced on Tuesday his run for president, is the only Democrat who calls himself a democratic socialist, most of the candidates running for office reflect the leftward shift of the party in recent years. Trump, who likes to give his foes nicknames and has attacked several Democratic contenders by name, will lead the charge, said Raj Shah, a former White House spokesman who is\u00a0advising the campaign. A top goal for 2019 will be using Trump\u2019s bully pulpit and campaign surrogates to define Democrats early, \u201cwhen these candidates are out there trying to define themselves,\u201d Shah said. He mentioned issues such as\u00a0the Green New Deal, Medicare-for-all and proposals for tax hikes on the wealthy as top targets to exploit. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an increasing number of\u00a070-30, or 80-20\u00a0issues, where the energy on the left is in one place but the mainstream of the country is in a different place,\u201d he said, referring to policies that he believes are disliked by 70 or 80 percent of the public. ``The president and the campaign are going to focus on exploiting those gaps.\u201d It\u2019s not clear how effective that strategy will be in 2020, as polls show growing public support for policies such as\u00a0Medicare-for-all and higher taxes on top earners. The president has told advisers that he wants his 2020 campaign to be about the wall, foreign policy and trade \u2014\u00a0themes he rode to an unexpected victory in 2016 but used with little effect during the 2018 midterms. His advisers believe that he can re-create the magic of 2016 in part by making his Democratic opponents so unappealing to voters that the eventual nominee comes out of the primaries bruised and fighting off low favorability ratings. Trump's campaign\u00a0Tuesday announced a handful of new hires who have\u00a0begun working on that goal. Kayleigh McEnany will serve as national press secretary, Marc Lotter will be the director of strategic communications and Tim Murtaugh will be the communications director, campaign manager Brad Parscale said Tuesday. \u201cTogether, we will spread the President\u2019s message far and wide and hold Democrat presidential candidates accountable for their extreme agenda,\u201d he said in a statement. McEnany and Lotter each have been pushing the \u201csocialist\u201d message for months, with more than 100 tweets between the two of them linking Democrats to socialism. \u201cDemocrats embrace socialism, but voters are sure to choose the Party of Lincoln over the Party of Lenin!,\u201d McEnany, a former Republican National Committee spokeswoman, tweeted in July. \u201cDemocrats are running FULL SPRINT toward socialism,\u201d Lotter, a former spokesman for Vice President Pence, tweeted Feb. 8, tagging one of the president\u2019s favorite channels. \u201cWill discuss tonight at 8:30p with @trish_regan on @FoxBusiness.\u201d The campaign\u2019s staffing announcement came one hour after self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders announced he was running in the Democratic presidential primary. Asked about Sanders on Tuesday, Trump held his fire, even complimenting the senator from Vermont on his trade policies. \u201cPersonally, I think he missed his time,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cBut I wish Bernie well.\" An August Gallup poll showed Democrats view socialism more positively than capitalism, a dynamic that Democratic 2020 contenders are navigating as Trump lobs barbs. But so far, Sanders is the only candidate embracing the label. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) told reporters in New Hampshire over the weekend that she is \u201cnot a democratic socialist.\u201d And during a CNN town hall Monday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)\u00a0distanced herself from some of the Democrats\u2019 most far-reaching policies, including Medicare-for-all (\u201csomething we can look to for the future\u201d) and the Green New Deal (\u201can aspiration\u201d and \u201csomething we need to move toward\u201d). The nuance in positions among the Democratic primary contenders probably won\u2019t be a factor in the Trumpworld messaging, as both the president and the campaign have sought to paint Democrats with a broad brush. \u201cBernie Sanders has already won the debate in the Democrat primary, because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism,\u201d McEnany said Tuesday in her first statement as press secretary. \u201cTo those who would try to impose socialism on the United States, we again deliver a very simple message: America will never be a socialist country,\u201d Trump said Monday in Miami, echoing a message from his State of the Union address this\u00a0month. Seeming to speak specifically to the issue of \u201cdemocratic socialism,\u201d Trump added: \u201cAll of us here today know that there is nothing less democratic than socialism. Everywhere and anywhere it appears, socialism advances under the banner of progress, but in the end it delivers only corruption, exploitation and decay.\u201d Ostensibly, Trump was in Miami to call for Venezuela\u2019s President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to step down peacefully as the Venezuelan people suffer from food shortages and hyperinflation. And while Trump\u2019s official remarks didn\u2019t mention any specific 2020 candidates \u2014 he didn\u2019t even mention the word \u201cDemocrats\u201d \u2014 the partisan strategy at play was unmistakable. Several elected Democrats in Miami support the White House\u2019s efforts to oust Maduro and back national congress leader Juan Guaid\u00f3. They were not invited to the event. Does President Trump declaring a national emergency to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border make you more likely or less likely to vote for him for reelection in 2020?

Eleven percent of Republicans say the emergency declaration makes them less likely to vote for Trump; so do 55 percent of independents. As Aaron Blake points out here, white men without a college education supported Trump in 2016 71 to 23 percent, but 47 percent said they're less likely to support him because of the declaration.

Roberts Jr. is not, as many conservatives believe, some kind of traitor to their cause, an unreliable ally who will stab them in the back whenever he gets the chance. In his own way, he\u2019s as devoted to the fortunes of the Republican Party as any of the other conservative justices. But unlike Samuel A. Alito Jr. (generally recognized as the most partisan judge on the court) or Brett M. Kavanaugh (who will almost certainly challenge Alito for that distinction), Roberts is playing a longer game. He\u2019s trying to save the GOP from itself. Let\u2019s begin with the decision on abortion, where Roberts sided with the four liberal justices to prevent a Louisiana \u201cTRAP\u201d (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers) law from taking effect before the court hears a challenge to it. The Louisiana law was almost identical to a Texas law the court struck down before Justice Anthony M. Kennedy retired. Thus, the four justices who dissented in the Louisiana case were saying not just that the previous decision should be overturned, but that the precedent itself is utterly meaningless and can be ignored even before they overturn it, if the law in question has the salutary effect of making it impossible for women to exercise their reproductive rights (that\u2019s not how they put it, of course, but that\u2019s the essence of their position). Pro-lifers were naturally outraged. But their anger at Roberts is completely misplaced. Roberts is no less committed than ever to seeing abortion rights eliminated. But he seems to want to do it carefully, in a way that minimizes the inevitable backlash against the Republican Party. Roberts, one must understand, voted to uphold the Texas TRAP law in the original case. Which means he will almost certainly vote to uphold the Louisiana law once the court hears it in full. But he doesn\u2019t want to just jump into it, as the other four justices on the right did, without making it seem like they\u2019ve considered the issue carefully. Had Roberts sided with the other conservatives, \u201cit would have been a signal to Republican judges throughout the country that the Supreme Court may not enforce decisions that the GOP disagrees with,\u201d as Ian Millhiser put it. If they\u2019re going to eventually uphold the Louisiana law anyway, it\u2019s much better not to be so obvious that they\u2019re just out to destroy abortion rights wherever they can. And when they do uphold the Louisiana law after a full hearing, that\u2019s what Roberts will accomplish. Rather than repealing Roe v. Wade outright, it\u2019s probably the best way for conservatives to achieve their goal of getting something identical to a repeal while avoiding at least some of the ensuing controversy. That\u2019s because as it stands now, state laws are not allowed to place an \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman\u2019s right to choose, putting so many obstacles in her path that it becomes difficult or impossible for her to exercise her rights. Increasing that burden is what conservative states have been doing for years, requiring things like waiting periods and forced ultrasounds, or imposing so many unnecessary regulations on providers that almost no one can meet them, leaving states with only a tiny number of providers. As a result of TRAP laws, there are now multiple states with only a single abortion provider. But if the Supreme Court were to overturn its ruling on the Texas law and validate the Louisiana law, it would have effectively overturned Roe v. Wade, yet in a way that won\u2019t produce screaming headlines reading \u201cRoe Overturned!\u201d The ruling would instead be a green light to Republican-run states that the court will judge virtually no burden to be \u201cundue.\u201d The conservative states that would outlaw abortion if Roe fell will then simply pass TRAP laws so onerous that nearly every abortion provider in those states will be forced out of business. The effect \u2014 abortion legal in Democratic-run states and essentially illegal in Republican-run states \u2014 will be the same. If your goal was to destroy Roe and to minimize the backlash Republicans will suffer at the polls, that\u2019s how you\u2019d do it. And Roberts is smart enough to know that with polls showing almost two-thirds of Americans against Roe being overturned, that backlash could be enormous. So on issues like that one, Roberts will tread carefully, trying to accomplish conservative goals while protecting the Republican Party from the consequences of its worst instincts. The same is true of the Affordable Care Act, where Roberts declined to join the conservatives in striking down the entire law, instead crafting a compromise that upheld most of it while allowing states to opt out of the Medicaid expansion (thereby denying health coverage to millions of poor Americans). Had the whole law been struck down, the consequences could have been cataclysmic, among other things making the arrival of universal, government-guaranteed health care much more likely. As a comparison, let\u2019s look at the other case the Supreme Court handed down on Thursday, which concerneda Muslim death-row inmate in Alabama who requested to have an imam present at his execution. The state denied his request, telling him that he could have a Christian chaplain or no one. This is not even a close call; you could look far and wide and not find a clearer and more egregious violation of the establishment clause of the Constitution. But John Roberts, along with Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil M. Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh, ruled that the inmate had waited too long (five whole days) to file his claim, and therefore he can be executed without a representative of his faith in attendance. These two cases are about very different subjects, but there's something else important that distinguishes them: The religious freedom case is unlikely to get much attention. That's in part because the plaintiff is unsympathetic, but also because the only people criticizing the decision will be legal scholars and the occasional liberal pundit. There will be no organized outcry from those on the right who claim to believe deeply in religious freedom, because what those people actually believe in is a sectarian version of religious \"freedom\" that actually means little more than that special privileges should be granted to conservative Christians. Roberts has been there for them in that quest, in cases, such as Hobby Lobby, that carved out areas where Christians need not follow laws they find displeasing. And let\u2019s not forget all the other times Roberts has joined with his conservative colleagues to accomplish right-wing goals. He eviscerated campaign finance law in Citizens United. He created for the first time an individual right to own guns in District of Columbia v. Heller. He gutted the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder. In short, you could argue that John Roberts is actually the most loyal Republican on the Supreme Court; it\u2019s just that unlike, say, Alito, he knows when the GOP has gone too far out on a limb and needs to be carefully reined back in for its own good. And that\u2019s what he\u2019ll keep doing.","174":"Only one year ago, adult-film actress Stormy Daniels had just begun a public fight to escape the constraints of an agreement she signed in October 2016 preventing her from discussing her relationship with President Trump. It was Daniels against an array of powerful people: The president of the United States, his pit bull personal attorney Michael Cohen, his personal legal team and, indirectly, the publisher of one of America\u2019s best-known tabloid magazines. Since then, the balance of power has shifted. Daniels\u2019s representation of what happened and the context for it has been embraced by her former opponents save one: Trump himself. This isn\u2019t simply political scorekeeping. The timing of the agreement reached with Daniels has long raised the question of motivation: Was it an effort to bury her allegations about a one-night stand with the president in order to keep it from influencing the election? If so, Cohen\u2019s involvement, as a representative of Trump and agent of the Trump campaign, would make the payment a violation of campaign finance law, according to experts who\u2019ve spoken with The Post. As of Monday morning, everyone involved in the payment except Trump now says that that\u2019s exactly why the payment was made. At the time, Daniels\u2019s attorney was a man named Keith Davidson. According to a court filing from last August, someone working for Daniels contacted the parent company of the National Enquirer, American Media Inc., to see whether they\u2019d be interested in buying Daniels\u2019s story about her encounter with Trump in 2006. AMI\u2019s CEO, David Pecker, and an editor contacted Cohen, with whom they had worked two months earlier to bury another such allegation involving a woman named Karen McDougal. Cohen contacted Davidson \u2014 who\u2019d also represented McDougal. The \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape had come out the day before the outreach to AMI. ABC News spoke with Davidson about the deal. \u201cThe \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape was the motivating factor in this case actually resolving,\u201d Davidson says. \u201cIt defeats the argument that this was done for purely personal reasons, and that this was in fact done for political reasons. Because after the \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape that something like this could be the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201d \u201cDo you think if Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal were not silenced with hush payments, Donald Trump would have won the election?\u201d he was later asked. \u201cI have no idea. I have no idea,\u201d Davidson replied. Asked if that thought ever kept him up at night, he said, \u201cA little bit, yes.\u201d The important part, though, is his assertion that the payment to Daniels \u201cwas in fact done for political reasons.\u201d Here\u2019s the legal problem. Candidates are bound by limits on what they can raise to spend on their campaigns and where that money can come from. They also have to then report what was raised and spent. Those rules come with constraints on agreements they can make with outside parties; after all, if you could only raise money from particular people but you could also tell outside groups to spent $100 million targeting voters in Arizona, there wouldn\u2019t be much point in having a fundraising limit. Cohen made the payment of $130,000 to Daniels with his own money, making it, according to those involved, just such a workaround. The money was off the books but meant to influence the election. Ironically, had Trump simply paid the $130,000 himself and included it in the money he was giving to his own campaign and then reported the payment, there would have been no legal violation. But that isn\u2019t what happened. Last August, Cohen admitted guilt in two campaign finance violations related to the Daniels and McDougal payments. The Daniels payment resulted in a charge of making an excessive campaign contribution, since the $130,000 he spent was more than the $2,700 he was allowed to give to the campaign. The McDougal payment was slightly different: He admitted to causing an unlawful corporate contribution, because he\u2019d worked to get AMI to buy her story and then never run it. Cohen himself has repeatedly admitted guilt \u2014 and that the payment was campaign-related. He did so in court when offering his guilty pleas, twice stating under oath that he had acted \u201cin coordination with, and at the direction of, a candidate for federal office ... to keep an individual with information that would be harmful to the candidate and to the campaign from publicly disclosing this information.\u201d There was only one candidate for whom he worked, but Cohen put a fine point on it during his congressional testimony last month. \u201c[L]ast fall I pled guilty in federal court to felonies for the benefit of, at the direction of and in coordination with Individual number one,\u201d as court documents identified the candidate. \u201cAnd for the record,\u201d Cohen said, \u201cindividual number one is President Donald J. Trump.\u201d AMI is also on record as stating that the payment to McDougal was made in order to influence the election. In order to avoid criminal charges stemming from its role in the hush-money payments, it reached an agreement with federal prosecutors. \u201cAs a part of the agreement, AMI admitted that it made the $150,000 payment in concert with a candidate\u2019s presidential campaign, and to ensure that the woman did not publicize damaging allegations about the candidate before the 2016 presidential election,\u201d read a news release from the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. \u201cAMI further admitted that its principal purpose in making the payment was to suppress the woman\u2019s story so as to prevent it from influencing the election.\u201d According to reporting from the Wall Street Journal (which first broke the Daniels story), AMI and Pecker later decided against seeking reimbursement for its payment to McDougal because attorneys indicated that it would further open them up to culpability for campaign finance violations. That repayment was the subject of an audio recording between Trump and Cohen in which, while discussing the campaign broadly, they agree that Trump should own the rights to McDougal\u2019s story lest Pecker get \u201chit by a truck\u201d and a new head at the National Enquirer decide to run the story. The AMI agreement with the government even hints at a meeting in August 2015 during which Cohen and another campaign official were told that the company would help bury negative stories. Daniels\u2019s attorney, Michael Avenatti, told CBS News\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last year that the payment from Trump was meant to influence the election, an assertion that at the time put him and his client ahead of the curve in making that charge. Since, nearly every other party involved has concurred that the Daniels payment and the McDougal payment were meant to protect Trump\u2019s election chances. Regardless of how you view Cohen\u2019s credibility \u2014 last year, he admitted to lying under oath to Congress \u2014 defenders of Trump are left arguing either that he, Davidson and AMI are all lying, or that campaign finance laws don\u2019t actually explicitly forbid the payments, a claim with which legal experts who\u2019ve spoke with The Post disagree. The alternative is that Trump is misrepresenting his role in the payments.","175":"Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the new U.S. measures blocking all U.S. revenue from Venezuela\u2019s national oil company were the latest example of Washington using economic sanctions to further U.S. commercial interests. The Kremlin has leveled similar criticism against U.S. sanctions on Russia and Iran.\u00a0 \u201cYou know the consistent attitude of Moscow toward such actions, which our American colleagues are taking more and more frequently,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cWe believe that in most cases, this is an instance of unfair competition.\u201d Maduro is a key ally of Russia in Venezuela, giving Moscow a geopolitical foothold a three-hour flight from Miami. Russia has extended billions of dollars in loans to Venezuela and in December dispatched nuclear-capable bombers to the country in a show of force.\u00a0 But it is far from clear that Russia\u2019s influence in the country will be enough to keep Maduro in power. Russian officials have continued to insist that Maduro is Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president and offered to mediate, along with Iran, among \u201cresponsible political forces\u201d in the country. But they have not offered details about any specific new help that Russia would be willing to provide to Maduro. Instead, Russia\u2019s Finance Ministry acknowledged Tuesday that Venezuela\u2019s loan repayments to Moscow may run into some head winds. Deputy Russian Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said it is not clear whether a $100\u00a0million payment due from Venezuela in March will arrive on time.\u00a0 \u201cThere will probably be some problems,\u201d Storchak told reporters, according to the Interfax news agency. \u201cIt\u2019ll all depend on the army, on the servicemen, how loyal they prove to be.\u201d","176":"Actors Bill Hader and Ben Stiller made guest appearances on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d during the weekend, parodying Michael Cohen\u2019s seven-hour testimony on Capitol Hill, which consumed the attention of Washington and the media. The cast started the show with a reenactment of Cohen\u2019s opening statement Wednesday to the House Oversight and Reform Committee, in which the former attorney and fixer for President Trump declared that Trump \u201cis a racist, he is a con man, and he is a cheat.\u201d \u201cI want this to stay professional,\u201d SNL\u2019s Kenan Thompson, who portrayed Chairman Elijah E.

Mediapart refused the search on the grounds that the officers did not have a warrant, and it complained that the attempt was a politically motivated effort to uncover its sources. \u201cThis raid is at once illegal and violent,\u201d Mediapart editor Edwy Plenel said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s an abuse of power, which violates the liberty of the press.\u201d The Paris prosecutor is an executive appointee and ultimately answers to the president. Macron picked the new prosecutor, R\u00e9my Heitz, in October. Heitz\u2019s office did not respond to request for comment. The Elysee Palace declined to comment on \u201can ongoing investigation.\u201d Advocates of independent media offered their support. \u201cIt is vital for a free press that journalists be able to protect confidential sources,\u201d Robert Mahoney, the deputy executive director of Committee to Protect Journalists, said in a statement. \u201cPublic prosecutors have no business poking around in newsrooms.\u201d Christophe Deloire, secretary general of Paris-based Reporters Without Borders, tweeted: \u201cSuch an attempt to undermine sources\u2019 secrecy by prosecutors accompanied by police officers is an unacceptable pressure on investigative journalism. Stop violations of freedom of the press!\u201d Mediapart last week published the results of a multi-month investigation into the \u201cBenalla affair\u201d \u2014 a political controversy that has been a recurring problem for Macron. Alexandre Benalla, one of the president\u2019s confidants and bodyguards, was caught on camera in May beating two labor protesters while impersonating a police officer. Macron didn\u2019t fire Benalla until the summer, after the controversy erupted, and explanations from the Elysee Palace shifted considerably, prompting a parliamentary inquiry into a possible coverup. Macron\u2019s government survived two separate votes of no confidence in July, but the Benalla episode dealt a devastating blow to Macron\u2019s approval ratings, which have yet to fully recover. The Mediapart report brought new headaches for the president in the form of previously undisclosed recordings purportedly of Benalla and Vincent Crase, a former head of security for Macron\u2019s party, La R\u00e9publique en Marche. \u201cSo the \u2018boss\u2019 is supporting us?\u201d the man identified as Crase asks on the tape. \u201cAh, well, he\u2019s doing more than supporting us,\u201d the person identified as Benalla replies. \u201cHe\u2019s like a madman. [.\u2009.\u2009. ] And he said just like that, he said, he told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to eat them alive. You\u2019re stronger than them.\u2019\u2009\u201d In Mediapart\u2019s telling, this was further evidence of a coverup by Macron. \u201cHe\u2019s been covering for Benalla from the beginning, it\u2019s very simple,\u201d Plenel told The Washington Post. \u201cHe\u2019s protecting him.\u201d The Mediapart investigation further suggested that Benalla and Crase violated judicial orders by meeting after they were formally placed under investigation. The investigation also reported that Benalla was \u201cpersonally involved\u201d during his time at the Elysee with the negotiation of a security contract with a Russian oligarch linked to Vladimir Putin. The confrontation between Mediapart and prosecutors brought to a boiling point long-simmering tensions between the media and the Macron administration. The French president has given few news conferences and has granted interviews only rarely. He moved the press room out of the Elysee Palace. He accused the media of not looking for the truth in the Benalla affair, and he signed a law against fake news \u2014 a move many journalists decried as dangerous for free speech. The relationship between the media and those in power in France is complicated, though. Journalists often allow government and nongovernment sources to review quotes before publication, and newspapers and magazines accept hundreds of millions of euros in government subsidies every year. (Digital-only Mediapart is funded by subscriptions.) \u201cThey can criticize the government, of course, but there is still a space of complicity with the institutions,\u201d said Daniel Schneidermann, a French media analyst and a columnist for Lib\u00e9ration. \u201cThe French press respect French institutions. They can be very violent against a particular government or law, etcetera, but there is a general accord with the institutions.\u201d Le Monde editor J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fenoglio dismissed concerns about state support \u2014 which has existed in various forms, on and off, for centuries and, in its postwar iteration, stems from the idea that a healthy democracy should encourage a diversity of opinion. Most government subsidies today come in the form of discounted postal rates for distributing print copies to subscribers, Fenoglio said. Le Monde also received 2.6 million euros, about $2.9 million, in direct aid in 2016, a stipend used for digital development, among other things. \u201cI know that seen from overseas, this can seem a little strange,\u201d Fenoglio said. \u201cIt\u2019s a French particularity. But to say it\u2019s a threat to the liberty of the press? .\u2009.\u2009. It has no impact whatsoever on the right to inform.\u201d It was Le Monde that broke the Benalla story last July. Macron perhaps assumed too much complicity when last week he suggested to a small coterie of journalists invited for coffee at the Elysee that the state \u201cfinance structures that assure neutrality.\u201d He was widely condemned by French media. \u201cIt\u2019s a little sad,\u201d Fenoglio said. \u201cThis kind of false vision of journalism at the head of state.\u201d","178":"France moved Wednesday to impose a 3 percent tax on Google, Apple, Facebook and other tech giants in a bid to advance an international agreement to clamp down on corporate tax avoidance. The proposed levy would affect Web companies that bring in more than \u20ac750 million ($848 million) in global revenue and \u20ac25 million ($28 million) in French receipts, and it would be applied only on domestic sales. More than two dozen companies meet that threshold, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said during a news conference in Paris, according to the Associated Press. Most are U.S.-based, though some large European and Chinese firms also would be compelled to pay. The tax will raise an estimated \u20ac500 million euros ($566 million) a year, Le Maire said. The French proposal, like others from European nations, comes amid broader efforts to modernize the international tax system. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is developing a plan to close global tax loopholes that allow billions of dollars to escape government coffers. Critics say that tech giants generate enormous wealth, but are not appropriately taxed where they do business. \u201cThese giants have created much value and they have created many jobs, and I will never denounce their success,\u201d Le Maire said, according to Bloomberg. \u201cBut we must fight against the distortions that these giants have created, especially on tax optimizations and on the dominant positions many have created. We must create taxation for the 21st century.\u201d Le Maire cited EU figures that show major tech companies pay, on average, 14 percent less tax than other European companies, according to the AP report. He said the tax would exclude transactions that involve the direct sale of products online but would mostly target firms that use data to sell digital advertising. The French parliament is expected to pass the tax proposal later this year. The cost to individual American tech companies could be significant, especially if other nations follow suit or the European Union establishes its own bloc-wide tax on tech firms. Facebook, for instance, does not break down revenue by country, but it took in nearly $14 billion in Europe last year. According to the company\u2019s earnings reports, Facebook paid an effective tax rate of 12.75 percent, on average, in 2018. Facebook said in a statement that it pays all taxes required by law wherever it operates. \u201cWe hope that the OECD will finish its work and create a clear, sustainable global agreement on tax,\u201d the company said. Google said it pays the vast majority of its corporate income tax in the U.S., noting in a statement Wednesday that it has paid a global effective tax rate of 23 percent for the past 10 years. \u201cWe always pay all of the taxes due and comply with the tax laws in every country we operate in around the world,\u201d Google said. Apple and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","179":"One of the most famous and insightful lines Donald Trump offered on the campaign trail in 2016 came during a stop in Iowa, shortly before that state\u2019s caucuses. \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and wouldn\u2019t lose any voters, okay?\u201d Trump said, mimicking firing a gun with his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, incredible.\u201d  It was a comment about the robustness of his base of support, and it repeatedly has been demonstrated to be true. But we\u2019d like to now introduce a corollary that is also true: Trump could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and few of his voters would consider the ensuing murder trial legitimate. Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law Lara Trump appeared on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News Channel talk show on Thursday, where she and the host discussed the newly robust House investigations of Trump\u2019s campaign and businesses. \u201cI think that Democrats right now are showing how scared they are with the fact that [special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s] report is probably going to be released soon, because they are frantic to find something else to throw at the president, to throw at anybody close to him,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he saw those 81 subpoenas last week. So ridiculous. And just \u2014 I mean \u2014 people should be shocked and appalled by this in our country. This is not how it\u2019s supposed to work. Just because you\u2019re still upset over an election that happened 2\u00bd years ago, you should not be allowed to try and ruin people\u2019s lives like this.\u201d  She\u2019s referring to 81 letters requesting more information that were sent to people and entities associated with the president in some way. (They were not subpoenas.) But notice how she contextualizes it: It\u2019s a desperate move to whip up a fake controversy targeting her father-in-law. The Mueller inquiry is biased, the argument goes, and with its conclusion, more biased investigations are needed. President Trump, of course, tweeted her comments. Lara Trump is not an impartial observer here, both as a relative of Trump\u2019s and as an adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign. But it\u2019s clear that her sentiment is shared. In December, Quinnipiac University found only 12 percent of Republicans thought the investigation of possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia was legitimate. Trump has been deliberate from the outset of the Mueller investigation in trying to establish its illegitimacy and partisan bias. Polling from HuffPost and YouGov shows that, over the past year, views of Mueller\u2019s efforts have remained static by party and by 2016 vote. It\u2019s an investigation that is most publicly associated with Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2014 an inquiry that began in 2017 by then-Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, a Trump appointee. This idea that investigations of Trump are illegitimate extends beyond those centered on the president. When the Manhattan district attorney announced 16 new indictments against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on Wednesday, a Republican consultant who spoke with the New York Times made clear how it would be framed. \u201cAny and every action even perceived to be a threat against him or his presidency will be framed as political retribution and an effort to undermine his 2016 victory,\u201d he said \u2014 echoing Lara Trump\u2019s later interview. Trump has been pitching this product since his first month in office. Manafort and Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen admitted to criminal acts, but Trump supporters either note those charges weren\u2019t related to Trump or, in the case of the campaign-finance charges admitted to by Cohen, they weren\u2019t actual crimes. Everything is trumped up and illegitimate until it isn\u2019t, at which point it\u2019s moved to an arm\u2019s length. One wonders what might break this spell. What might emerge from the House investigations that would be so damning as to give even Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters pause? There may be nothing at all, of course, but this is a president who was sued for fraud in connection with his real estate \u201cuniversity\u201d and whose machinations surrounding his nonprofit foundation were well known before the election. He was on tape bragging about groping women and then insisted that allegations he had groped specific women were all lies \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t seem to have done much to dent his popularity in some quarters. But what if it has shown that he committed insurance fraud, as Cohen intimated during congressional testimony? What if he actually did directly collude with an agent of Russia, the main qualifier identified by Trump fans as demonstrating collusion in an informal survey we conducted. Or something else? It would be an interesting political experiment if Trump were to shoot someone dead, how his base might respond to what happened next. We would nonetheless prefer he not undertake it. What Trump was saying when he made that \u201cFifth Avenue\u201d comment wasn\u2019t just that his base was loyal. It was that he could hold their loyalty. It\u2019s hard to believe that only 12 percent of Republicans would view the Russia investigation as illegitimate if Trump hadn\u2019t been constantly harping on about its illegitimacy.","180":"Since President Trump\u2019s May announcement that the United States will pull out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, Europe has been stuck in the middle of the diplomatic dispute between Washington and Tehran, with European firms facing U.S. sanctions if they maintain business links with Iran. Now, a Trump administration policy shift over a 1996 U.S. law on Cuba threatens to put European business interests at the heart of another geopolitical dispute. A section of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (Libertad) Act allows Cuban Americans and other U.S. citizens to sue entities that use property confiscated by the Cuban government after the 1959 Cuban revolution. Every president since the law\u2019s passage has suspended that section \u2014 Title III \u2014 in large part because it could have international repercussions. Continuing to suspend Title III helped \u201cminimize diplomatic friction with Europe in particular,\u201d said Peter Harrell, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. What would it mean if U.S. law allowed American citizens to take European companies to court? We may be about to find out. On Tuesday, the administration decided it would only partially suspend Title III. Effective March 19, U.S. citizens and companies that lay claim to Cuban property will be allowed to sue Cuban entities. The administration will continue to block lawsuits against foreign firms for now. But that decision, it said, will be reevaluated after 30 days. The Trump administration\u2019s handling of the matter suggests that there is a \u201cpretty decent likelihood that they\u2019re going to allow lawsuits against foreign firms,\u201d or at least those foreign firms partnering with Cuban entities in Cuba, eventually, Harrell said. An example, he said, could be a European hotel company partnering with a Cuban one, or \u201ca European port operator that was involved in a cruise terminal in Cuba where the terminal was on expropriated property.\u201d These moves could have a big effect on business in Cuba. \u201cIf the Trump administration opened up lawsuits on foreign companies doing business with the Cuba restricted list, [it\u2019s] hard to see the European companies kind of wanting to continue that business,\u201d said Harrell, who was deputy assistant secretary of state for counter threat finance and sanctions in the Obama administration. The Trump administration\u2019s decision to break with precedent is \u201clargely a function of who has access to the president,\u201d said Michael Dobson, of counsel in Morrison & Foerster\u2019s National Security practice group. That includes, in particular, national security adviser John Bolton. \u201cIf it causes non-U.S. companies to second-guess their activities or add an additional risk premium to existing ventures or upcoming ventures \u2014 that seems part of a general pressure campaign aimed at what Ambassador Bolton called the \u2018troika of tyranny,\u2019 \u201d said Dobson, a reference to Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. But Europeans \u2014 many of whom joined the United States in recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as interim president of Venezuela after he declared himself the rightful head of the crisis-hit country in late January \u2014 may not appreciate that, yet again, the United States has decided to tell other countries where they can do business. Part of the reason that Title III was suspended was that \u201cthe threat of these lawsuits has historically been extremely unpopular in Europe,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cMuch like the Trump administration is doing with secondary sanctions with Iran today \u2014 Europeans saw this as an affront to their sovereignty.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty on-the-rocks relationship between the U.S. and Europe,\u201d Harrell said. If the Trump administration goes forward with this, Harrell added, \u201cit\u2019s going to be another irritant.\u201d Read more: Cuba moves toward officially recognizing private property, foreign investment Visual story: Castro\u2019s rule through the years Castro rule in Cuba ends as Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel confirmed in leadership change","181":"An advocacy group asking members of Congress to support impeachment of President Trump has landed its first two recruits: Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). The group, which bills itself as By the People, announced Tuesday that the freshman lawmakers \u2014 both of whom have been at the center of controversies during their short tenure on Capitol Hill \u2014 are the \u201cbrave first\u201d members of Congress to sign its pledge. There has been little doubt about Tlaib\u2019s position on the issue since her first day on the job, when she famously proclaimed at a reception her desire to \u201cimpeach the motherf-----.\u201d After several days of national attention for her profane description of the president, Tlaib said she was sorry to have created a distraction but would never apologize for being \u201cpassionate and upset.\u201d In a statement released by By the People on Tuesday, Tlaib referred to Trump as \u201cIndividual 1,\u201d referencing his moniker in a federal indictment of his former personal attorney Michael Cohen for campaign finance violations, among other crimes. \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure to support this pledge to impeach Donald Trump,\u201d Tlaib said in the statement, which her office authenticated. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for us to show people, especially families in my district, that they are being put first \u2014 and that we\u2019re going to hold everyone accountable to the law, including the President of the United States.\u201d A spokesman for Omar also confirmed her signing of the pledge. Omar made national headlines this month after her suggestion on Twitter that Israel\u2019s allies in U.S. politics were motivated by money rather than principle. She later apologized. Democratic House leaders have cautioned against calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment before special counsel Robert S. Mueller III submits a report on his investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. Mueller is also examining whether Trump sought to obstruct the probe. Alexandra Flores-Quilty, a spokeswoman for By the People, said the group plans to continue asking members of Congress \u201cto show moral leadership\u201d by signing its pledge. Among those considering the pledge, she said, is Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), who introduced impeachment articles against Trump shortly after the new Congress convened in January. \u201cWe can let the Trump administration continue to corrupt our government and endanger our lives \u2014 or we can join together to remove Trump from office and make our government work for all of us,\u201d Flores-Quilty said in a statement. \u201cWe the people have the power and the responsibility to impeach Trump. And now everyone who calls this country home can track where their members of Congress stand.\u201d","182":"We do not know the underlying contents or even the barest conclusions of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s final report as of this writing. The range of outcomes for President Trump run from a declaration by Mueller that \u201cthe only thing preventing an indictment of the president was the Justice Department guideline\u201d to \u201cI found no evidence of a criminal violation by President Trump.\u201d Much has been written about the Democrats\u2019 dilemma once the report\u2019s contents are known. Will their base demand impeachment hearings? What\u2019s the point of impeaching if the Senate won\u2019t act? However, let\u2019s say for the sake of argument that the report shows: 1.) Trump hired multiple campaign officials who had, collectively, more than 100 contacts with Russians and solicited a hostile foreign power\u2019s help in winning the presidency; 2.) Trump lied repeatedly about his pursuit of a business deal with a hostile foreign power while running for president; and 3.) Trump took a slew of actions (from misleading the public to seeking leniency for Michael Flynn to intimidating witnesses in plain sight) that, if committed by anyone other than the president, would be grounds for indictment. Do the Republicans plan on running in 2020 under the banner: Leave the Russian patsy in power \u2014 or What\u2019s a little obstruction between friends? If so, they will have to defend not simply Trump\u2019s criminal innocence but also his fitness to serve after committing all of the above. They\u2019ll have to explain why none of that rises to the level of \u201chigh Crimes and Misdemeanor,\u201d and why the country should allow him to continue as the chief executive charged with enforcement of the nation\u2019s laws and the Constitution. Even in the best-case scenario for Trump, the facts we know about already are damning; in a world without a political party reduced to know-nothing cultists, they would be disqualifying for office. That\u2019s not all. Maybe before the 2020 election we\u2019ll learn the results of the Southern District of New York investigation(s) on allegations of conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws, defraud banks and cheat on taxes, and other possible crimes. Are Republicans going to back a president who\u2019s found responsible for any or all or those, or, if the investigation is not complete, back a president who, in his second term, could be found to have committed multiple financial crimes? What\u2019s the defense? Hey, everyone pays off mistresses and files false campaign finance statements! What gets lost in the discussion of impeachment vs. indictment and the presence or absence of a felony is the reaffirmation that Trump\u2019s conduct \u2014 be it lying about his Russian business interests or trying to decapitate investigations \u2014 is in no sense acceptable for someone sworn to \u201ctake care\u201d that the laws are enforced. He\u2019s a menace to the presidency and to the rule of law and patently unfit to hold presidential powers. The Fox News hosts and their zombie audience will deny this, but what about \u201crespectable\" Republicans who like the tax cuts and judges but find most everything else objectionable? I suppose they could descend further into intellectual hackery and support reelection, but you\u2019d think they\u2019d at least consider looking for a nominee without an ocean liner full of baggage. As for potential GOP primary challengers, now is the time, not to wait for polls but to make the case that, even if not indictable or impeachable, Trump in no shape or form should be entrusted with another four years in office.

The public\u2019s cautiousness extends to its expectations for the forthcoming report from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who has been examining ties between Russia and Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. Half of Americans report they have \u201cjust some\u201d confidence or none at all that the Mueller report will be fair and evenhanded, and 43\u00a0percent say they have at least a good amount of confidence in its fairness. [Read full poll results  | How the poll was conducted ] The survey was conducted Monday to Thursday, the day before Mueller\u2019s team unveiled criminal charges against longtime Trump friend Roger Stone, accusing the political operative of lying, obstruction and witness tampering. The poll results underscore the complex calculation ahead for Democrats and their new House leader, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), as they balance calls from core supporters to aggressively investigate and possibly even impeach Trump against the potential political backlash from other voters. The impeachment question has gained attention in the days since the Democrats\u2019 House majority was sworn in, with party leaders insisting they will wait to consider their options until after Mueller finishes his work and Trump declaring, \u201cYou can\u2019t impeach somebody that\u2019s doing a great job.\u201d Six in 10 adults support the party using its congressional authority to obtain and release Trump\u2019s tax returns, the survey shows. Similar majorities support Democrats investigating suspected financial ties between Trump and foreign governments, the president\u2019s relationship and communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as possible collusion in the 2016 campaign. And yet a 46\u00a0percent plurality suspect Democrats will \u201cgo too far\u201d in their inquiries of Trump, while just over one-third think they will handle it about right. Meanwhile, public support for impeachment has dropped in recent months, the poll shows. In the August Post-ABC poll, conducted immediately after Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance and other charges and personally implicated Trump in some of his acts, 49\u00a0percent said Congress should begin impeachment proceedings that could lead to Trump being removed from office, while 46\u00a0percent said Congress should not. In the new survey, a smaller 40\u00a0percent support impeachment proceedings, while a 55\u00a0percent majority oppose them. Partisans have long held sharply different views of Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, but the new Post-ABC poll shows many Democrats are uncertain about the special counsel\u2019s final report. Just over 6\u00a0in\u00a010 Democrats say they are confident the report will be fair and evenhanded, while slightly more than 3\u00a0in\u00a010 report \u201cjust some\u201d confidence or less. Among self-identified independents, 40\u00a0percent are confident Mueller\u2019s final report will be fair, while 53\u00a0percent express less faith. Confidence drops to 22\u00a0percent among Republicans. It is not clear whether the public\u2019s wariness toward Mueller\u2019s forthcoming report reflects skepticism in the special counsel himself, anticipation of its findings or the nature of its release. A poll this month by the Pew Research Center found 55\u00a0percent of adults saying they are \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d confident Mueller is conducting a fair investigation, attitudes consistent with surveys since late 2017. The timeline for Mueller finishing his report is unknown, and it is uncertain how much of the report will be made public. Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee, William P. Barr, told senators during his confirmation hearing earlier this month that he would release a summary of the report but that he did not know \u201cwhat will be release-able\u201d given department regulations. In Congress, the poll shows House Democrats garner majority support from fellow partisans and independents for investigating possible collusion with Russia in 2016, as well as suspected financial ties between Trump and foreign governments. Roughly 8\u00a0in\u00a010 Democrats and about 6\u00a0in\u00a010 independents support Democrats probing Trump\u2019s relationship with Putin, which has come under increased scrutiny following a Washington Post report that Trump concealed details of their face-to-face meetings. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans oppose Democrats investigating possible collusion, while nearly two-thirds oppose investigating Trump\u2019s relationship with Putin and suspected financial ties with foreign governments. Roughly one-third of Republicans, however, support investigations on these latter issues. Trump\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns in line with the tradition of modern presidential candidates was widely unpopular during the 2016 presidential campaign, and the Post-ABC poll shows support for Democrats enforcing that norm. By 60\u00a0percent to 35 percent, more say Democrats should use their congressional authority to obtain and release Trump\u2019s tax returns. In their first week in control of the House, Democrats unveiled a bill requiring presidential candidates to release 10\u00a0years of tax returns and mandating more transparency for inaugural and transition committees, a law that would apply to Trump in a reelection run. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the idea was effectively dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled chamber. Democrats may have difficulty balancing pressure for aggressive investigations and perhaps impeachment of Trump from their party\u2019s base with the need to avoid alienating independent voters ahead of the 2020 presidential election. A 64 percent majority of Democrats support Congress beginning impeachment proceedings against Trump \u2014 55\u00a0percent support this \u201cstrongly.\u201d Among political independents, a 45\u00a0percent plurality think Democrats will go too far investigating Trump, more than the 34\u00a0percent who think they will handle this about right, and 18\u00a0percent believe they will not go far enough. The Post-ABC poll was conducted by telephone Jan. 21-24 among a random national sample of 1,001 adults, with 65\u00a0percent reached on cellphones and 35\u00a0percent on landlines. Overall results have a 3.5-percentage-point margin of sampling error for the full sample.","184":"Liberal Democrats have been talking about a Green New Deal for months now, and on Thursday morning, they unveiled its first iteration, a resolution introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (Mass.). The resolution, which you can read here, isn\u2019t a detailed piece of legislation. Instead, it\u2019s a statement of intent, explaining the justification and goals of a massive infrastructure program to transition to a sustainable future. This is at once incredibly ambitious and politically practical, in that its advocates seem to have in their minds a long-term plan to get it accomplished. Don\u2019t be surprised if in short order it becomes one of the defining pieces of the Democratic agenda, both in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail. Since Democrats have control of only one house of Congress, the course that Green New Deal advocates are following is to begin by articulating the need and establishing the framework of a plan. That gives Democrats something to get behind and drives a discussion, putting the issue on the agenda for the next couple of years. If they succeed, when it becomes actually possible to pass such a plan and have it signed by a Democratic president \u2014 2021 at the earliest \u2014 the question will no longer be whether we need a Green New Deal, but what it should and shouldn\u2019t include. That\u2019s the idea, anyway. If you want a point-by-point examination of the proposal, I\u2019d suggest this analysis from David Roberts of Vox, but here\u2019s the synopsis from Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s website: The Green New Deal is a 10-year plan to create a greenhouse gas neutral society that creates unprecedented levels of prosperity and wealth for all while ensuring economic and environmental justice and security. The Green New Deal achieves this through a World War 2 scale mobilization that focuses the robust and creative economic engine of the United States on reversing climate change by fully rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, restoring our natural ecosystems, dramatically expanding renewable power generation, overhauling our entire transportation system, upgrading all our buildings, jumpstarting US clean manufacturing, transforming US agriculture, and putting our nation\u2019s people to work doing what they do best: making the impossible possible. Whenever Democrats offer a major policy proposal, the immediate response from both Republicans and journalists is \u201cHow will you pay for it?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez was asked that question in an interview that aired on NPR on Thursday morning, and she was happy to say that yes, government is going to spend money on these projects: We have tried their approach for 40 years. For 40 years, we tried to let the private sector take care of it. The said \u201cWe got this. We can do this. The forces of the market are going to force us to innovate.\u201d Except for the fact that there\u2019s a little thing in economics called externalities. And what means is that a corporation can dump pollution in the river and they don\u2019t have to pay for it, and taxpayers have to pay for cleaning up our air, cleaning up our water, and saving the planet. And so we\u2019ve already been paying the costs, except we have not been getting any of the benefit. And so what we\u2019re here to say is that government is not just for cleaning up other people\u2019s mess, but it\u2019s also for building solutions in places where the private sector will not. This is perhaps the most important feature of this proposal: In both its content and the way its advocates are selling it, it\u2019s meant to change the way we think about government projects. You can see why this would make Republicans nervous, beyond the fact that they don\u2019t particularly care about climate change and don\u2019t like government to do much of anything affirmative. They have managed to shape the debate on government spending in an extraordinary way, in that the things they want to spend money on, like tax breaks for the wealthy or wars or enormous military budgets, are almost never questioned in the same way. When Republicans say \"We need to spend three-quarters of a trillion dollars on the military next year,\" reporters don't pepper them with questions about how it'll be paid for. It's just accepted that it's worthwhile, and therefore deficit spending is an appropriate way to finance whatever taxes don't cover. Ocasio-Cortez and others are making the same argument about green infrastructure, as well as things such as expanding health coverage: It\u2019s worthwhile, and if deficit spending is what\u2019s required to pay for it, that\u2019s fine. Up until now, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have been tiptoeing around the idea of a Green New Deal, saying that they support it in theory but they want to see the details before endorsing anything. Now there\u2019s something for them to grab on to, and so they\u2019ll have to make a decision. My guess is that nearly all of them will in fact endorse it. It leaves enough room to say that they\u2019ll adjust the particulars once they\u2019re president, while also giving them a quick and easy way to signal to primary voters not only that they\u2019re serious about climate change but also that they\u2019re willing to think big and bold. And it\u2019s almost impossible to overstate how important that is for members of the Democratic base right now. They\u2019re tired of timid technocrats who want to take existing policy and make a nip here and a tuck there. They want not only ambitious proposals but also candidates who don\u2019t accept how Republicans have shaped the debate in ways that are so familiar we barely notice them. Endorsing the Green New Deal will allow the candidates to say: That\u2019s the kind of president I\u2019ll be. And if the eventual nominee becomes president, she\u2019ll have no choice but to follow through.

Only President Trump could use his encounter with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un to reinforce some of the worst things his former lawyer Michael Cohen said about him in congressional testimony Wednesday. Nothing Trump does should surprise us anymore, yet it was still shocking that the man who holds an office once associated with the words \u201cleader of the free world\u201d would refer to a murderous dictator as \u201cmy friend.\u201d It\u2019s clear by now that Trump feels closest to autocrats and is uneasy with truly democratic leaders, as Germany\u2019s Chancellor Angela Merkel, among others, has learned. The president\u2019s apparatchiks also gave us an instructive hint as to what an unrestrained Trump might do to the free press. They excluded White House reporters Jonathan Lemire of the Associated Press and Jeff Mason of Reuters from the press pool covering the dinner between Trump and Kim for daring to ask inconvenient questions of our country\u2019s elected leader. This wasn\u2019t the work of Kim or Vietnam\u2019s authoritarian government. It was the imperious action of a man who wishes he could live without the accountability that free government imposes. It was an appropriate prelude to the attempt of Republicans on the House Oversight Committee \u2014 from the moment the committee\u2019s chairman, Rep.\u2009Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), gaveled Wednesday\u2019s hearing to order \u2014 to use procedural maneuvers to block Cohen\u2019s testimony. The Democratic majority swept the GOP motion aside, signaling the end to an unaccountable Trump presidency. \u201cThe days of this committee protecting the president at all costs are over,\u201d Cummings declared. The GOP Congress\u2019s obsequiousness toward Trump has been costly to the country. And it\u2019s no wonder the president\u2019s apologists sought to keep Cohen from speaking to a national audience. His testimony was damaging to Trump both personally \u2014 \u201cHe is a racist. He is a con man. He is a cheat.\u201d \u2014 and legally, because it opened new avenues of inquiry. Cohen alleged that Trump was informed by his longtime friend Roger Stone of a WikiLeaks dump of emails that could harm Hillary Clinton. This was not dispositive about whether Trump directly colluded with Russia \u2014 Cohen was careful about this in replying to Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who was badly hurt by the stolen emails. But as The Post\u2019s Philip Bump noted, Cohen\u2019s testimony means that \u201cthe distance between the candidate and Russia\u2019s interference efforts is much shorter than realized.\u201d Cohen also testified that Trump, as president, continued to reimburse him for the costs of hush-money payments to two women who said they had affairs with Trump. This moves the issue of whether Trump broke campaign finance laws into the White House itself. And Cohen said Trump \u201cknew of and directed\u201d negotiations over building a Trump Tower in Moscow throughout the campaign, further enmeshing the president with Russian interests \u2014 and with efforts to mislead voters in 2016 about his Russian ties. These and other Cohen claims and revelations underscore how much time has been lost because Republicans ignored their obligation to get to the bottom of the many allegations enveloping Trump. Their past evasions are of a piece with the convoluted intellectual somersaults they are now performing to protect him. The utter irresponsibility of the House over the past two years \u2014 the Senate Intelligence Committee was far more diligent, though still cautious \u2014 meant that public accountability was largely confined to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe and journalistic investigations. Having successfully prevented Congress from acting forcefully, the Trump camp is now saying that if Mueller does not find utterly devastating smoking-gun evidence of collusion, Democrats who control the House should shelve all further inquiries and move on. What\u2019s forgotten is the profound difference between the Trump case and the Watergate experience. Congressional hearings into President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s behavior were held simultaneously with a special prosecutor\u2019s investigations. What brought Nixon down were the tapes of his White House conversations orchestrating the coverup. And we learned of the tapes when his aide Alexander Butterfield revealed their existence, first to Senate staffers and then at an open hearing. Congress, not the special prosecutor, forced Nixon to resign. Their fear that this might happen again is why House Republicans worked so hard to delegitimize Wednesday\u2019s hearing. They and Trump would prefer Congress (and the media) to leave us in the dark. Fortunately, we do not live in North Korea. Read more from E.J.

We got a peek on Wednesday of the extent of possible financial crimes including bank and insurance fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy to violate campaign finance law.

(On the latter, Cummings sent out a letter demanding the White House comply with a request for information relating to security clearance procedures. which they\u2019ve be trying to get a hold of for a couple of years. The highlight of the week may have been his concluding remarks at the Cohen hearing: For all that we can say, well done, Mr. Chairman.","188":"Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former fixer and personal lawyer, concluded a day of testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday in front of the House Oversight Committee. Some highlights of his testimony: \u25cfCohen alleged that Trump knew in advance that the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks planned to publish hacked Democratic National Committee emails. \u25cfHe sparred aggressively with GOP lawmakers, who questioned his credibility and motives for coming forward. \u25cfHe detailed how deeply and personally involved Trump was in the scheme to pay off an adult-film actress who alleged that she had an affair with Trump. \u25cf He described how he, like many in Trump\u2019s orbit, had long sought to protect the president, but made clear: \u201cI am not protecting Mr. Trump anymore.\u201d \u25cf He suggested that federal prosecutors are investigating unspecified criminal allegations involving the president that have not been made public. [Read Cohen\u2019s opening statement and see the documents he presented to Congress.] 5:30 : Cummings: Cohen wants to \u2018make sure our democracy stays intact\u2019 In extemporaneous and occasionally rousing final remarks, Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) sought to portray Cohen\u2019s path to redemption as one the country should follow. \u201cIf we as a nation did not give people an opportunity after they made mistakes to change their lives, a whole lot of people would not do very well,\u201d Cummings said. Rebutting Republicans\u2019 attempts to portray Cohen as a deceitful opportunist, Cummings said that the former fixer had been trying to send a message when he testified about the president\u2019s alleged misdeeds. \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re crying out .\u2009.\u2009. for us getting back to normal,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cIt sounds to me like you want to make sure our democracy stays intact.\u201d Cohen sat silently while appearing to wipe away tears. As Cummings concluded his remarks and adjourned the hearing, cheers rose.  5:25: Jordan: Cohen was lying then, and he\u2019s lying now In his concluding remarks, Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), the ranking Republican, reminded the committee that \u201cMr. Cohen has been dishonest in the past,\u201d then accused him of misleading the committee in his testimony Wednesday. \u201cThere are things he said today .\u2009.\u2009. that just don\u2019t add up,\u201d Jordan said, before launching into a litany of what he claimed were erroneous or incomplete statements Cohen had made. Among them, Jordan said, were Cohen\u2019s claims that he never defrauded a bank; that he said he had no contact with foreign entities (though Cohen says he answered accurately on the committee\u2019s disclosure form); that he didn\u2019t set up a self-promotional Twitter account; and that he never wanted a job in the Trump administration. Jordan also said Cohen had violated his duty as Trump\u2019s lawyer by never considering whether paying off women was appropriate. Jordan again blasted Cummings for bringing Cohen to testify instead of focusing on other oversight matters. 5:17: Cohen fears Trump will not relinquish power peacefully if he loses in 2020 Cohen concluded his public testimony with perhaps his harshest comments of the day about the man he once served loyally, asserting that he fears what could happen in 2020 should Trump lose his bid for reelection. \u201cMy loyalty to Mr. Trump has cost me everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not sit back, say nothing and allow him to do the same to the country.\u201d \u201cGiven my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power, and this is why I agreed to appear before you today,\u201d he said. He concluded with biting remarks addressed directly at Trump himself. \u201cWe honor our veterans, even in the rain,\u201d he said, a reference to Trump\u2019s decision to cancel a planned trip to a cemetery while visiting France because rain grounded his helicopter. \u201cYou don\u2019t use the power of your bully pulpit to destroy the credibility of those who speak out against you,\u201d he said. \u201cThis behavior is churlish. It denigrates the office of president of the United States and it is simply un-American. \u201cI pray the country does not make the same mistakes I have made,\u201d he said. 5:10: Charges of racism hit close to home as Trump dispute gets personal The final questions in Cohen\u2019s hearing devolved into a passionate argument that had almost nothing to do with the witness, after two Democratic freshmen \u2014 Reps. Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) \u2014 said that just because Trump might have a black friend didn\u2019t mean that he wasn\u2019t a racist. (Cohen agreed.) The statements harked back to a moment from earlier in the hearing, when Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) had Department of Housing and Urban Development employee Lynne Patton, who is black, stand behind him as he challenged Cohen\u2019s characterization of Trump as someone who freely expressed racist sentiments. Tlaib made the direct connection, opining that it \u201cis alone racist in itself \u2026 to use a black woman as a prop\u201d to disprove Cohen\u2019s statements. A red-faced Meadows immediately objected to what he interpreted as Tlaib calling him a racist, demanding that Tlaib\u2019s comments be removed from the record of the hearing \u2014 and accusing her of being the racist in the room. \u201cIt\u2019s racist to suggest that I asked her to come in for that reason,\u201d Meadows said. But Tlaib defended her comments, telling the panel that she was criticizing the act as racist, not Meadows as a person \u2014 and apologizing if it sounded different. Cummings reminded people that he is the son of former sharecroppers in settling the spat. \u201cI can see and feel your pain,\u201d he said to Meadows \u2014 who, he told the assembled audience, is one of his best friends. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think Ms. Tlaib intends to cause you that kind of pain and that kind of frustration.\u201d 4:56 p.m.: AOC focuses on Trump\u2019s tendency to falsely state assets Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has had her shot at Cohen. She spent her time focused on Cohen\u2019s testimony that Trump would falsely inflate the value of his assets in settings where he could gain financial or reputational advantage \u2014 and then deflate them in other instances for the same reason. For instance, Cohen told Ocasio-Cortez that Trump submitted \u201cinflated\u201d assets to insurance companies at times. In other instances, Trump has down played the value of his golf courses to local tax officials, in an effort to get tax breaks. 4:49 p.m.:  Cohen guesses Trump lied about his tax returns being under audit Trump told the public that an ongoing audit prevented him from releasing his tax returns during the 2016 campaign. But his former lawyer said that the reason Trump didn\u2019t want to release his tax returns is because he was afraid of an audit \u2014 and doubts the one Trump referenced ever existed. \u201cWhat he didn\u2019t want was to have an entire group of think tanks that are tax experts run through his tax return and start ripping it to pieces,\u201d Cohen said Trump told him. \u201cThen he\u2019ll end up in an audit and he\u2019ll ultimately have taxable consequences, penalties, and so on.\u201d When Trump said an audit was preventing him from releasing his tax returns, Cohen asked Trump for a copy, he said \u2014 but he \u201cwas never able to obtain one.\u201d \u201cI presume that he was not under audit,\u201d Cohen said. 4:40 p.m. : President\u2019s son involved with adult actress reimbursements Under questioning by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Cohen said that Trump, his son, Donald Trump Jr., and Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg were aware that the payments to Stormy Daniels were being made to keep her affair with Trump from becoming public. Cohen has already implicated Trump in his plea deal with prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. \u201cThere are three other people who were equally involved in this conspiracy?\u201d Khanna asked? \u201cYes,\u201d Cohen replied. Khanna called the transaction a \u201cscheme\u201d that constitutes \u201cfinancial fraud,\u201d and is separate from any potential wrongdoing Mueller is investigating. Khanna asked whether the transaction was being investigated by the Southern District, but Cohen declined to answer, saying \u201cit could be part of an investigation that\u2019s currently ongoing.\u201d Khanna also noted that the payments to Cohen were made from a Trump trust, which Cohen confirmed. Asked whether he knew why he was being paid out of a trust, as opposed to the company\u2019s accounts, Cohen said he didn\u2019t know. \u201cI was just happy to get the check.\u201d 4:32 p.m.: Testimony resumes, as committee clears up foreign disclosure issue After a lengthy afternoon break, Cohen has resumed his blockbuster testimony to the House Oversight Committee. The committee began with an issue that Republicans had pressed earlier in the day \u2014 whether Cohen had properly disclosed to the committee contracts he has held with foreign companies. After consulting with his lawyers, Cohen told the committee that he did not believe he was required to disclose his contracts with any foreign businesses, because a disclosure form he received asked for money from foreign governments. Cohen said he was willing to disclose his contact with a bank in Kazakhstan, which he argued was not a government entity though it is majority-owned by the Kazakh government. Jordan, the ranking Republican, said Cohen should also disclose his work for a Korean entity. Cummings, the committee chairman, said he would work with Cohen on making the disclosures and that they were not \u201can unreasonable request.\u201d 3:37 p.m.: Trump campaign spokeswoman blasts Cohen Trump remains in Vietnam and hasn\u2019t responded to Cohen\u2019s testimony aside from a morning tweet. His 2020 campaign spokeswoman, though, blasted Cohen\u2019s credibility in a statement Wednesday afternoon. \u201cMichael Cohen is a felon, a disbarred lawyer, and a convicted perjurer, who lied to both Congress and the Special Counsel in a \u2018deliberate and premeditated\u2019 fashion according to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office,\u201d the spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany, wrote. \u201cNow he offers what he says is evidence, but the only support for that is his own testimony, which has proved before to be worthless. As noted by the Southern District of New York, Cohen\u2019s wide array of crimes were \u2018marked by a pattern of deception that permeated his professional life\u2019 and his \u2018instinct to blame others is strong.\u2019 Prosecutors said his actions were to ensure that he would \u2018profit personally, build his own power, and enhance his level of influence.\u2019 This is the same Michael Cohen who has admitted that he lied to Congress previously. Why did they even bother to swear him in this time?\u201d 3:31 p.m.: Assange lawyer denies that Roger Stone had call with WikiLeaks founder Cohen alleged in his opening statement that he listened in on a call in July 2016 in which Roger Stone claimed to Trump he had talked with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and he thus knew the organization was about to release a batch of emails. Barry Pollack, a lawyer for Assange, denied that Stone had such a call with Assange. \u201cRoger Stone did not have the telephone call Michael Cohen described Stone claiming to have had with Julian Assange,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cIt is ironic that while Stone and Cohen have both been charged with lying, and the public tries to untangle those lies, Mr. Assange apparently faces criminal charges in the Eastern District of Virginia for his role in publishing truthful information.\u201d 2:34 p.m.: Cohen says he felt Trump was threatening him  Cohen delayed his appearance before the Oversight Committee for almost a month because he felt Trump was threatening him \u2014 but it\u2019s Trump\u2019s army of loyal followers he appears to fear most. Trump could do \u201ca lot\u201d to hurt him, Cohen told Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.). \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just him, it\u2019s those people.\u201d The people Cohen was referring to are, in his own words, the \u201c60-plus million people that follow [Trump] on social media,\u201d who often heed what Trump says. Some of those followers, Cohen said, have sent him messages over various social platform threatening him and his children \u2014 messages he said he has turned over to the Secret Service. Cohen recalled Trump\u2019s statement \u201cthat he can walk down Fifth Avenue, shoot someone and get away with it\u201d \u2014 noting that after Trump started calling him a \u201crat,\u201d he took those to heart. \u201cI don\u2019t walk with my wife to go to a restaurant or go somewhere. I don\u2019t walk with my children, I make them go before me,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cNever in my life did I think Mr. Trump would do something so disgraceful,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cHe\u2019s attacking them because he knows I care about my family.\u201d 2:25 p.m.: Cohen: Trump made me lie to Melania about Stormy payments Cohen testified that Trump called on him to not only lie to the American public about campaign-time hush payments to adult-film star Stormy Daniels \u2014 but also his wife, Melania. During a back-and-forth with Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.), Cohen said Trump phoned him one day when he was in the car with a friend and then handed the phone to his wife so he would deny the allegations and the hush payments. \u201cNot only did I lie to the American people, I lied to the first lady,\u201d Cohen said. Steube used his time to call into question Cohen\u2019s claim that Trump knew about and reimbursed him to buy the silence of women alleging sexual relationships with Trump during the 2016 election. \u201cThere is absolutely no proof that those payments were for those specific purposes. Is that correct?\u201d Steube asked. Cohen seemed annoyed, noting that he had presented the panel with two of the 11 checks Trump wrote to reimburse him. \u201cDo you have any proof?\u201d Steube asked. \u201cJust the payments,\u201d Cohen responded. \u201cSo, no email?\u201d the Republican pressed. \u201cMr. Trump doesn\u2019t have email!\u201d Cohen said. \u201cNo text message?\u201d Steube continued. \u201cMr. Trump doesn\u2019t text,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that anybody out there thinks that I just decided to pay $130,000\u201d for nothing, Cohen said. But his last response put the entire line of questioning to rest: Trump\u2019s attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani himself had come out to say Trump reimbursed Cohen for the hush payments, Cohen said. 2:15 p.m.: Cohen claims he talked to Corey Lewandowski about \u2018business travel to Russia\u2019 When Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about his pursuit of a possible Trump Tower Project in Russia during the campaign, court documents contained an interesting revelation. Cohen, the documents said, was said to have discussed business travel to Russia with a senior campaign official. The official, though, was not identified, nor were there enough clues to effectively identify the person. Until Wednesday. Under questioning from Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.), Cohen said the official was Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s then-campaign manager. Cohen said he and Lewandowski discussed what dates Trump might have available \u2014 though the trip never came to fruition, because Cohen could not actually get ownership of a piece of property in Russia. At the time of Cohen\u2019s plea, Lewandowski denied he was the official referred to in court records. \u201c100% not true,\u201d he said in a text message. He did not immediately return another message Wednesday. 2:10 p.m.: Cohen: \u201cI\u2019ve never been to Prague\u201d Cohen killed the Prague Saga \u2014 again. The president\u2019s former lawyer said under oath that he has never visited the Czech Republic, a revelation that calls into question the veracity of a salacious document alleging that Russians were blackmailing Trump. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) used the tail-end of his five minutes to ask Cohen about an allegation in the \u201cdossier\u201d complied by ex-British spy Christopher Steele that he\u2019d visited Prague during in the summer of 2016 to meet with Kremlin officials. According to the document, Cohen was there to discuss a payment to the hackers who breached the Democratic National Committee. But Cohen said that wasn\u2019t possible. Why? Because, \u201cI\u2019ve never been to Prague.\u201d Norman did not follow up on his answer. Cohen\u2019s statement also calls into question reports that seemed to substantiate the Prague claim in the dossier. McClatchy reported last year that the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had proof that Cohen was in Prague that summer and that it had phone records substantiating his presence. 2:01 p.m.: Cohen says he is not aware of a Trump \u2018love child\u2019 Cohen mentioned earlier during the day how American Media Inc. chief executive David Pecker paid off more people than just Stormy Daniels. The Daniels episode, he told Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), was \u201cdifferent than other times\u201d \u2014 which is why he took the matter straight to Trump. But there were other circumstances, Cohen said, when Pecker would make \u201ccatch and kill\u201d transactions to silence stories that might hurt Trump, and \u201cnot all of them had to do with women.\u201d Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) asked for examples. Cohen gave him a juicy one: a $15,000 payment to find out if an elevator operator knew anything about a story that Trump had a love child with an employee. Cohen said he didn\u2019t. But, he said, Pecker had buried plenty of other stories that could look bad for the president if they ever emerged. \u201cWhen David [Pecker] was looking to become CEO of Time magazine, we were concerned about the treasure trove of documents\u201d he might leave behind, Cohen said. Cohen said, too, that he was not aware of any Trump \u201clove child,\u201d though he said that Pecker paid $15,000 to a former Trump employee who claimed he had such knowledge, again, for the purpose of killing the story. 2 p.m.: Cohen says he does not believe Trump mistreated wife or long rumored tape exists Various news outlets have reported that in October 2016, a secret auction was held to purchase a tape that was said to contain footage of Trump striking or otherwise hurting his wife Melania in an elevator. Cohen told the committee that he was aware of rumors of the tape but did not believe it has ever existed. What\u2019s more, he said he does not believe Trump ever hit or mistreated his wife. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about that tape for years,\u201d he said, in response to questions from Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.). \u201cI don\u2019t believe that auction was real, and I don\u2019t believe that Mr. Trump ever struck Mrs. Trump. Ever.\u201d Cohen said that he was aware of four or five people who tried to buy the rumored tape, he said the purposes of burying it so it would not become public. None were ever able to locate the tape, leading him to believe it did not exist. 1:56 p.m.: Trump knew DNC email dump was coming, even if he didn\u2019t know what it would do Cohen related a meeting he had with Trump in mid-July 2016, in which Roger Stone told Trump over speakerphone that he \u201cjust got off the phone with Julian Assange, and in a couple of days there\u2019s going to be a massive dump of emails that\u2019s going to significantly hurt the Clinton campaign.\u201d Cohen said he wasn\u2019t sure if Trump knew the substance of what those emails would say. He added that Trump\u2019s longtime secretary, Rhona Graff, would have also been aware of the call, as she transferred it back to Trump\u2019s office. Cohen guessed the meeting took place on July 18 or 19 \u2014 the first tranche of emails released by the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks would come out just a few days later. 1:50 p.m.: Did Cohen actually want a White House job? The question has been kicking around the committee hearing room a few times Wednesday, as Cohen has said repeatedly that he never wanted a job in the administration, and was content to just serve as Trump\u2019s lawyer. The problem is, federal prosecutors thought otherwise \u2014 and those words are emblazoned on a display board prominently featured on the Republican side of the dais. \u201c[Cohen] expected to be given a prominent role and title in the new administration. When that did not materialize, Cohen found a way to monetize his relationship with the president,\u201d the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York is quoted as saying. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) asked Cohen repeatedly if he was accusing the U.S. attorney of lying. Cohen said no \u2014 but also insisted that the statement was \u201cnot accurate.\u201d \u201cI did not want the role in the new administration,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI got exactly the role that I wanted. There is no shame in being personal attorney to the president.\u201d 1:40 p.m.: Cohen on Trump: \u201cHe speaks in code, and I understand the code\u201d Cohen has testified that while Trump never directed him to lie to Congress about a potential Trump Tower Moscow during the 2016, he made his desires known through hints. Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) asked Cohen to elaborate more on these hints that Trump would give, seeking to shed light on how Trump gives orders without saying the words specifically. Cohen said Trump likes to give orders by making a sweeping claim \u2014 then asking a question that\u2019s not really a question, per se. Cohen likened it to a powerful individual pointing to his tie and claiming it\u2019s \u201cthe nicest looking tie!\u201d\u2014then asking a subordinate if he or she agrees. Similarly, Cohen has testified that while the two were in frequent contact about the prospect of a Trump Tower Moscow during the campaign, Trump would at times look at him and say something along the lines of, \u201cThere is no Moscow project.\u201d Cohen said he took that as a sign to lie to the public and to Congress about Trump\u2019s business interests in Russia during the campaign. \u201cHe speaks in a code, and I understand the code,\u201d Cohen said. 1:35 p.m.: Cohen: Trump was in on the hush-payment lie  Cohen testified that the president personally called him to make sure he continued to lie about hush payments made to women alleging sexual relationships with him during the 2016 presidential campaign. Rep. Katie Hill, a freshman Democrat from California, used her time to ask Cohen about Trump\u2019s role overseeing his former lawyer\u2019s lies to the public about the payments. When news first broke about the payments, Cohen lied to the public, saying he used his own personal funds and that \u201cneither the Trump Organization nor Trump Campaign were party to the transaction.\u201d \u201cWas that statement false?\u201d Hill asked. Cohen said no \u2014 \u201cbecause I personally left out Trump individually from that statement.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what was discussed to do between myself, Mr. Trump and Allen Weisselberg,\u201d the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, Cohen said. Cohen also said Trump called him during an interview with a reporter making sure that he continued the misleading claim. 1:30 p.m.: Did Cohen lie again? Republican lawmakers, led by Meadows, charged Cohen with intentionally omitting foreign contracts he has held in the past two years from a \u201ctruth in testimony\u201d form he filled out before Wednesday\u2019s hearing \u2014 something, that if true, would count as another lie to Congress. But there\u2019s a dispute about whether the GOP actually read the questions right. The short, two-page form \u2014 a copy of Cohen\u2019s was provided to The Washington Post \u2014 shows that he wrote \u201cN\/A\u201d in two places asking him to disclose contracts with foreign entities. Yet according to his own testimony, Cohen has held foreign contracts within the past two years. Meadows lept on this discrepancy, demanding Cohen explain why he had appeared to lie to Congress yet again. Cohen claimed he hadn\u2019t, promising to consult with his lawyer and amend the form if he made a mistake. For a hearing in which the central theme has been Cohen\u2019s credibility, the omission would have been an example of the point the GOP has been making: Once a liar, always a liar, and his testimony against Trump should not be trusted. But Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) pointed out, the form has a footnote: For witnesses not representing a government, the foreign contracts and payments that must be disclosed are those \u201coriginating with a foreign government.\u201d Cohen maintains his foreign contracts did not involve foreign governments. 1:24 p.m.: Felix Sater takes center stage Rep. Harley Rouda Jr. (D-Calif.) used his time to press Cohen about Trump\u2019s relationship with Felix Sater, a former Trump business associate who had deals to build Trump Soho in New York, as well as to attempt to build in Fort Lauderdale, Moscow and elsewhere. Sater also worked with Cohen during the presidential campaign to pursue a Trump Tower in Moscow. [Former Mafia-linked figure describes association with Trump] In sworn testimony in a 2013 deposition, Trump had testified that he wouldn\u2019t recognize Sater if the two were in the same room. But Cohen testified that Sater was a business partner and had been given both a Trump business card and an office in the Trump Organization\u2019s suite. These details had been known previously, but Cohen was able to offer a personal touch: He testified that he was quite familiar with Sater\u2019s office, since he took over the same space after Sater vacated it. Rouda referred to Sater repeatedly as a \u201cconvicted Russian mobster.\u201d Sater immigrated to the United States from Soviet Russia as a child. In 1998, he was convicted of taking part in a stock pump-and-dump fraud that used members of the Italian mob as muscle. He was spared prison time and prosecutors kept his plea deal under seal for years while he assisted the government and provided information on issues related to organized crime and national security. When information about his involvement in the scheme became public, Trump sought to distance himself from his onetime partner, including in the 2013 deposition. Asked by Rouda if Trump was being misleading in the deposition or, \u201cat worst, lying under oath,\u201d Cohen responded simply, \u201cyes.\u201d 1:20 p.m.: Cohen says Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow edited congressional testimony later found to be false Cohen asserted Wednesday that Jay Sekulow, Trump\u2019s lawyer, edited the congressional testimony to Congress that he would later admit was false \u2014 implying that Sekulow might have, in part, caused it to be wrong. Cohen confirmed to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) that Sekulow was the lawyer he alleged previously had edited his congressional testimony, and he confirmed, importantly, one of the changes had to do with \u201cthe length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive.\u201d Cohen has admitted he lied about the project, telling lawmakers discussions about it ended by January 2016, when in fact they continued into the summer \u2014 the heart of the presidential campaign. \u201cThere were several changes that were made, including, how we were going to handle that message,\u201d Cohen said when asked about Sekulow\u2019s edits. \u201cWhich was \u2014 the message of course being the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive.\u201d \u201cThat was one of the changes?\u201d Raskin said. \u201cYes,\u201d Cohen responded. In response to questions later from Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), Cohen said he electronically circulated his written testimony before speaking to Congress previously to a group of lawyers for the president and others because he was part of a joint defense agreement. He said the testimony was reviewed, for instance, by a Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner. Asked, however, to cite specific edits made to the document by Sekulow, he said he could not cite any without reviewing the document. 1:15 p.m.: Trump\u2019s implicit message: No Russia, no collusion \u2014 and make sure prosecutors know Cohen was asked to describe whether the president gave any orders during a May 2017 meeting held the day after special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was appointed. During the meeting with Cohen and Jay Sekulow, Cohen recalled Trump saying things like \u201cit\u2019s all a witch hunt and this stuff has to end.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019d been saying that to me more many, many months,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I knew exactly what he wanted me to say.\u201d In the months that followed, Cohen would be called in to speak with lawmakers \u2014 to whom he lied about Trump business dealings in Russia \u2014 and eventually, prosecutors, who would charge him for those lies, and financial crimes. He pleaded guilty in December and is expected to begin a three-year prison sentence in May. Cohen also recalled how Trump had told him: \u201cMichael, there\u2019s no collusion, there\u2019s no Russia, there\u2019s no involvement, no interference.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the message, the stay on point, that\u2019s the party line that he created,\u201d Cohen explained. \u201cThat\u2019s the message that he wanted to reinforce.\u201d 1 p.m.: Cohen sidesteps question about last conversation with Trump, cites ongoing criminal probe Cohen suggested federal prosecutors in New York are investigating some unspecified crime involving Trump, declining to answer questions about his last conversation with the president because of a request that he not discuss an ongoing inquiry. Oversight Committee member Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) pressed Cohen on his final conversations with the Trump. The last time they spoke, Cohen said, occurred about two months after the FBI raided his home and office last April \u2014 but he could not disclose what was said, he continued. \u201cUnfortunately, this topic is actually something that is being investigated right now by the Southern District of New York, and I\u2019ve been asked by them not to discuss, and not to talk about these issues,\u201d Cohen said. Krishnamoorthi followed up: \u201cIs there any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven\u2019t yet discussed today?\u201d \u201cYes, and again, those are part of the investigation that is currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York,\u201d Cohen responded. The testimony is an ominous sign for Trump, signaling potential continued law enforcement interest in him or those around him. The Southern District had investigated hush-money payments made to women alleging sexual relationships with Trump during the campaign, and Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations regarding these transactions. But Cohen has talked in detail about that case, so he is probably referring to something else. Federal prosecutors in New York did, though, recently issue a sweeping request for documents related to donations and spending by Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. 12:50 p.m. Republicans hone in Cohen\u2019s legal advice to the president Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has honed in one of Trump\u2019s best defenses to the allegation that he participated in an illegal campaign finance scheme: Wasn\u2019t Trump just following the advice of his lawyer, Michael Cohen? Trump\u2019s defenders have insisted that, despite Cohen\u2019s plea deal, it would be very hard to bring criminal charges over the payments against Trump in part because he was being advised by a lawyer. Massie asked Cohen if a lawyer has an ethical obligation to provide good legal advice. Cohen agreed that he does. \u201cI believe so,\u201d Cohen responded. He referenced Cohen\u2019s written testimony, in which he said he paid the money to Daniels without considering whether it was the right thing to do. \u201cIs that being a good lawyer? To not even consider whether it\u2019s legal or not?\u201d Cohen maintained that he was looking to protect Trump and knew what Trump wanted because he had been dealing with threats from Daniels to go public that dated to 2011. 12:40 p.m.: Cohen provides a date for claim Stone told Trump he was in contact with Assange In his written testimony, Cohen merely said that he heard Stone tell Trump he had been in contact with WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange in July 2016, shortly before the publication of stolen emails by WikiLeaks. Pressed to provide an exact date in oral testimony, he told lawmakers that he believed the conversation occurred on either July 18 or 19, likely the second day. That would place it three days before WikiLeaks published internal Democratic Party emails on July 22. Massie noted that Assange had claimed publicly in June that he had damaging material about Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you have fake news. I\u2019m saying you have old news,\u201d he said. (He did not address Cohen\u2019s assertion that he heard Stone claim had been in personal contact with Assange.) 12:30 p.m.: \u2018We are not the fact-checkers for BuzzFeed.\u2019 Back from a break in the hearing, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) opened his questions by zeroing in on a disputed BuzzFeed News article that alleges Cohen had told the special counsel that Trump directed him to lie to Congress. Jordan noted that Cohen\u2019s attorney, Lanny Davis, had said in the wake of that report he could not confirm or deny it \u2014 though the special counsel\u2019s office would soon come out say it was wrong. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he deny the BuzzFeed story?\u201d Jordan asked of Davis. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t think it was his responsibility to do that,\u201d Cohen responded. \u201cWe are not the fact-checkers for BuzzFeed.\u201d In his opening statement, Cohen had said Trump did not tell him to lie to Congress, though he intuited that is what Trump wanted. Jordan, though, did not press into the substance of what discussions, if any, Cohen and Trump might have had about his testimony. Instead, he seemed to batter Davis for not knocking down the story, and noted that the special counsel had. \u201cThe special counsel said \u2014 something they\u2019ve never done \u2014 they said that story was false,\u201d Jordan said, after he and Cohen repeatedly interrupted the other. \u201cMy response, the president has told something over 9,000 lies to date, do I ask Mr. Davis or Mr. [Michael] Monico, do I go on television to correct his mistakes?\u201d Cohen responded. Monico is another of Cohen\u2019s lawyers. After Cohen\u2019s opening statement, BuzzFeed reiterated through a spokesman that it stands by its story. 12:25 p.m.: Cohen won\u2019t rule out movie or book deal, or political office in New York Under questioning from Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), Cohen declined to rule out that he would one day pursue a book or movie deal, or run for political office in New York. Foxx was trying to press Cohen on the idea that he was motivated to testify to remain in the public eye, which Cohen disputed. But under more specific questioning, Cohen declined to commit that he would not pursue public activities in the future. \u201cCan you commit under oath that you will not, that you have not, and will not pursue a book deal,\u201d Foxx asked. And I would not do that, no,\u201d Cohen responded. He also declined to commit that he would not pursue a political office in New York. 12:15 p.m.: Cohen: I\u2019m responsible for your silliness Cohen has said he was motivated to turn on Trump and change previous testimony to Congress because he was distressed by Trump\u2019s reaction to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville and his interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki. Most of all, Cohen said, he was moved by what he called \u201cwatching the daily destruction of our civility to each other.\u201d He noted the Republicans displaying a sign calling him a \u201cliar, liar\u201d and called it \u201cunbecoming\u201d of Congress \u2014 behavior he said has been influenced by Trump\u2019s discourse. \u201c \u201cI\u2019m responsible for your silliness because I did the same things that you\u2019re doing now,\u201d he said. \u201cI protected Mr. Trump for 10 years.\u201d He passionately argued that others who surround the president should learn from his example. \u201cLook at what\u2019s happened to me. I had a wonderful life .\u2009.\u2009. And I\u2019ve lost it all,\u201d he said. As a pre-lunch final offering, he offered a vivid and devastating portrait of what it was like to work for the Trump Organization: \u201cEverybody\u2019s job at the Trump Organization is to protect Mr. Trump. Every day most of us knew we were coming and we were going to lie for him about something. That became the norm.\u201d 12:10 p.m.: \u2018Liar Liar Pants On Fire\u2019 Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) jeered the traditional schoolyard chant of \u201cliar, liar pants on fire\u201d at Cohen Wednesday, in what was likely the simplest iteration of a refrain Oversight Committee Republicans have been repeating all day: that Cohen\u2019s testimony cannot be trusted. Oh, and he also had a \u201cLiar Liar Pants on Fire\u201d sign, with Cohen\u2019s face on it, for effect. \u201cYou\u2019re a pathological liar. You don\u2019t know truth from falsehood,\u201d Gosar charged, suggesting that if Cohen had been worth anything as a lawyer, he should know he had a \u201cduty of loyalty\u201d and \u201cduty of confidentiality\u201d to his client \u2014 in this case, Trump. \u201cHow can anybody listen to this pathological person?\u201d Gosar asked. In the moments that followed, Gosar and Cohen fell into a classic \u201cyes it is\u201d \u2014 \u201cno it\u2019s not\u201d spat, debating whether Cohen was testifying negatively about Trump simply to make a deal with federal prosecutors and reduce his jail time. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how my appearance today is providing substantial information that the Southern District can use for the creation of a case,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cLiar, liar, pants on fire,\u201d Gosar concluded. \u201cNo one should ever listen to you and give you credibility.\u201d 12:09 p.m.: Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump were briefed on Trump Tower Moscow discussions, Cohen says Cohen said Wednesday that while he pursued a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow as Trump was running for president, he briefed the president\u2019s children, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, on several occasions, as well as Trump himself. In naming Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., Cohen was clearing up a mystery in court records filed as part of his plea \u2014 which noted he had briefed Trump family members about the project but did not identify them by name. Cohen said he briefed the Trump children about 10 times, as well as reporting back to Trump every time he had a discussion about the project. \u201cAfter each communication that I had, I would report back to him,\u201d Cohen said. Trump has claimed in the past he had no business involvement in Russia; Cohen\u2019s testimony takes direct aim at that. Cohen himself has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the matter, and he said Wednesday he did so \u201cin furtherance of my protection of Mr. Trump.\u201d \u201cI am not protecting Mr. Trump anymore,\u201d he said. 12:06 p.m.: Cohen\u2019s lawyer Lanny Davis is working free Republicans continue to press an allegation that Wednesday\u2019s hearing has been orchestrated by former Clinton operative Lanny Davis, who is working as an attorney for Cohen. In response to questions from Rep. Jody Hice (R-Georgia), Cohen testified that he reached out to Davis to represent him, not the other way around. Cohen said that Davis is not currently being paid for his work. 12:04 p.m.: Cohen: No proof Trump is a racist  Cohen said he doesn\u2019t have proof that Trump is a racist, telling Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) that while he has \u201cmaybe 100\u201d secret recordings of Trump talking, none of them include comments he\u2019s made about black individuals. Meadows, a close ally to president Trump, pressed Cohen for evidence of his allegation that Trump was racist. Cohen in his opening statement said Trump \u201conce asked me if I could name a country that was run by a black person that wasn\u2019t a \u2018s----hole,\u2019\u201d and he said Trump \u201ctold me black people would never vote for him because they were too \u2018stupid.\u2019\u201d Meadows pointed to his guest at the hearing, Trump associate Lynne Patton, to counter that assertion. Patton, who is black and who stood behind Meadows as he spoke, submitted a comment for the record saying Trump is not racist. \u201cYou made some very demanding comments about the president that Ms. Patton doesn\u2019t agree with,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cShe says there is no way she would work with an individual who is racist.\u201d He added his own take, too: \u201cI\u2019ve talked to the president more than 300 times. I have not heard a racist comment from the president.\u201d Meadows also pressed Cohen about consulting contracts Cohen signed after Trump became president, when Cohen collected more than $4 million to advise major companies. Wasn\u2019t Cohen selling access to Trump, Meadows asked? Cohen insisted that he was paid to advise on the \u201cenigma\u201d of Donald Trump. \u201cNot something that\u2019s unusual in Washington,\u201d he said. He said that he was, for instance, paid $1.2 million by the drug company Novartis and agreed he spoke to company executives no more than six times. But Cohen insisted he did not lobby for his massive fees, an important assertion for the former lawyer since he never registered to lobby on their behalf. 11:55 a.m.: Behind the scenes of the Trump response to the \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape In October 2016, Cohen said he received in a phone call from Trump adviser Hope Hicks while he was traveling in London, asking for his help. News was about to break that the president had been caught on video saying obscene things about what famous people could do to women. Hicks, Cohen testified, asked him if he could call reporters he knew. \u201cWe want you to just spin this,\u201d she said, according to Cohen. Cohen offered the behind-the-scenes interactions of Trump advisers about the now infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in response to questions from Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D. C.). He said the campaign was particularly worried about the tape because Trump around the same time was facing allegations that he engaged in extramarital affairs, which he was hoping to pay to keep quiet. \u201cI was concerned about it, but more importantly, Mr. Trump was concerned about it,\u201d Cohen said. Norton pressed aggressively on whether Trump\u2019s concern was because of the election, and Cohen said it was. That is important because Cohen has pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations in connections to the payments to the women, which might have been legal if they were merely to shield Trump from personal embarrassment. Cohen has alleged he arranged the payments at Trump\u2019s direction. 11:50 a.m.: \u2018Shame on you, Mr. Jordan\u2019 Cohen joined the select ranks of witnesses who have erupted at Jordan, the committee\u2019s ranking Republican, during their testimony, after Jordan accused him of disputing federal prosecutors\u2019 determination that he is a liar. \u201cShame on you, Mr. Jordan,\u201d Cohen said, warning Jordan against casting aspersions on him. \u201cI made mistakes, I own them, and I didn\u2019t fight with the Southern District of New York \u2026 what I did do is I pled guilty and I am going to be going to prison.\u201d \u201cI took responsibility \u2026 I take responsibility for my mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cI am remorseful, I am going to prison.\u201d The retort came on the heels of an exchange with Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), who challenged his characterization of Trump. \u201cYou called Trump a cheat. What would you call yourself?\u201d Comer asked Cohen. \u201cA fool,\u201d he answered. 11:48 a.m.: Cohen says National Enquirer \u2018Catch and Kill\u2019 for Trump began before 2007 In response to questions from Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), Cohen has explained how \u201ccatch and kill\u201d worked, the practice by which David Pecker, the head of AMI, which publishes the National Enquirer, would agree to help Trump by buying negative stories about him and then never have the magazine write about them. Cohen explained that he was involved with \u201cseveral\u201d such episodes. So far, only one has been made public. As part of Cohen\u2019s plea, he agreed that he worked with Pecker to have AMI purchase the rights to model Karen McDougal\u2019s story that she had an affair with Trump. The tabloid outlet never ran her story. Cohen did not outline other such episodes with which he was involved but noted that Pecker\u2019s practice of buying and burying negative stories about Trump began even before Cohen was hired to work for the Trump Organization in 2007. Maloney asked Cohen whether there were other women who had made claims similar to McDougal\u2019s and Daniels\u2019s. Cohen replied that he could not recall but noted, \u201cit\u2019s certainly the two that we know about.\u201d Cohen described an ongoing conversation about how Trump should repay him for the hush money he paid to Daniels. Could the business let Cohen throw a party at a Trump Organization facility? Did Cohen know someone who wanted free membership to a Trump golf club? Finally, he explained, with time running out before Daniels sold her story to an outlet that would publicize it, he said the decision was made to simply repay Cohen the money. 11:34 a.m.: Cohen: Trump is capable of colluding to win Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.), who chaired the Democratic National Committee when it was hacked by the Russians during the 2016 election, pressed Cohen on whether Trump was capable of \u201ccolluding\u201d with Russia to win the 2016 election. Cohen said, \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 though he initially hesitated, noting that answering such a question would be pure speculation on his part. \u201cI\u2019d rather not answer that question,\u201d he initially said, but later agreed: \u201cTrump\u2019s desire to win would have him work with anyone.\u201d Cohen was unable to answer the Florida Democrat\u2019s question about whether Trump knew about the DNC hacking before it happened. But he confirmed that Trump\u2019s children likely also knew about the Trump Organization\u2019s attempt to build a Trump tower in Moscow during the 2016 election. \u201cThe company was involved \u2026 which meant the family was involved,\u201d he said. Wasserman Schultz continued: \u201cIs it possible the whole family is conflicted or compromised with a foreign adversary in the months before the election?\u201d Cohen answered yes. Wasserman Schultz, who resigned her DNC position following the hacking and release of internal emails, asked Cohen if he thought Trump was so desperate to win that he would collude and coordinate with Russia or a foreign power. \u201cIt calls on so much speculation \u2026\u201d he trailed off. \u201cMr. Trump, he\u2019s all about winning and will do what is necessary to win.\u201d He continued: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the word \u2018colluding.\u2019 Was there something odd about the back-and-forth praise with President [Vladimir] Putin? Yes. But I\u2019m not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion. I was not part of the campaign. I don\u2019t know the other conversations Trump had with other individuals.\u201d 11:30 a.m.: Cohen says he has been offered book and TV deals, and even a movie option He\u2019s been offered book deals, TV deals, even a movie option, Cohen said Wednesday \u2014 but he\u2019s taken none of them, yet. \u201cI don\u2019t expect I\u2019m going to have a source of income when I\u2019m in federal penitentiary,\u201d Cohen told Rep. Mark E. Green (R-Tenn.), a first-term congressman who was tapped as the first rank-and-file GOP member of the panel to get to ask questions. Green only addressed two questions to Cohen, about his expected sources of income and who had paid for him to come testify to Congress. Cohen said he paid his own way. For the rest of the time, Green delivered a soliloquy about Cohen\u2019s questionable credibility, scoffing at panel Democrats for picking a \u201cstar witness\u201d who had committed basically every infraction he was accusing Trump of orchestrating. As Green excoriated Cohen, \u201cnone other than a scorned man\u201d who, he said, had lied about everything from his finances to the birth of his child, he never looked at him, delivering his comments to wall cameras at the back of the room. As Cohen listened, his blank look eventually gave way to an entertained smile. 11:28 a.m. Cohen alleges Trump inflated assets Cohen provided to Congress three documents called \u201cstatements of financial condition,\u201d which he said Trump had prepared to show potential lenders that he was worthy of a loan. Cohen said that these three statements \u2014 from 2011, 2012 and 2013 \u2014 were shown to Deutsche Bank, as Trump sought a loan to purchase the Buffalo Bills football team. Trump, in the end, did not buy the team. These statements were not rigorously audited financial documents. Instead, they amounted to Trump\u2019s own estimates about what he was worth and what he owed. Trump himself was the main source of the data. But the 2013 statement showed something remarkable. That year, Trump rapidly increased his own estimate of his net worth \u2014 from $4.6 billion to $8.6 billion. The reason was not a new building or a big business success by Trump. Instead, Trump simply assigned a massive dollar value \u2014 $4 billion \u2014 to his own brand, and then counted that brand among his assets, as if it was a building or a golf course. The result was that his net worth nearly doubled. In his statement, Cohen said that these statements were part of a pattern of Trump exaggerating his net worth, when it benefited him. \u201cIt was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes,\u201d Cohen said. 11:20 a.m.: \u2018You didn\u2019t get brought to the dance\u2019 Jordan, the panel\u2019s ranking Republican, made clear in his first exchange with Cohen what Republicans line of attack will be at the hearing: Cohen is a disgruntled employee, upset that he couldn\u2019t get a job in the Trump White House. Jordan opened his questioning of Cohen by walking the president\u2019s former personal lawyer through a litany of wrongdoing \u2014 including tax and bank fraud \u2014 to which he has pleaded guilty, but has nothing to do with Trump. He highlighted a Twitter account that he said Cohen had created, \u201cWomen For Cohen,\u201d that seemed to promote Cohen\u2019s personal brand. \u201cWas that done to protect the president?\u201d Jordan sneered. Cohen asserted a woman at an outside firm, RedFinch, had created the account to help blow off steam during the heart of the high-stakes presidential campaign. \u201cWe were having fun,\u201d Cohen said. Jordan then turned to his main line of attack. \u201cYou worked for [Trump] for 10 years, Mr. Cohen. How long did you work in the White House?\u201d Jordan asked. \u201cI never worked in the White House,\u201d Cohen responded. \u201cThat\u2019s the point, Mr. Cohen, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jordan asked. \u201cYou wanted to work in the White House. You didn\u2019t get brought to the dance.\u201d Cohen insisted he was offered White House jobs, and said he could tell a story of Trump \u201creaming out\u201d chief of staff Reince Priebus because Trump wanted him to work in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office. \u201cMr. Jordan, all I wanted was what I got, to be personal attorney to the president,\u201d Cohen said. 11:18 a.m.: Cohen says Trump approved hush money payments as president, but as a fake retainer Cohen said \u201cthere is no doubt\u201d in his mind that Trump was acutely aware that Daniels, the adult-film actress, was being paid to keep silent about an alleged affair she had with the president, payments orchestrated through Cohen. He brought check images with him to show how and when Trump incrementally reimbursed him for the $130,000 payment to Daniels \u2014 showing that Trump was intimately involved with the scheme, even while president. One check for $35,000, dated March 17, 2017, was issued from a trust account belonging to Trump, and signed by his son, Trump, Jr. Another check, dated Aug. 1, 2017, was from Trump\u2019s personal account \u2014 and signed by the president himself. Cohen conceded that Trump Jr. might have had only \u201ccursory information,\u201d about what was afoot, though Trump and the COO of the Trump organization were intimately involved. Cohen said the payments were made directly because they were \u201cdeclaratively a retainer for services that would be provided for the year of 2017.\u201d But \u201cthere is no retainer agreement,\u201d he noted. 11:06 a.m.: Cohen is officially no longer a lawyer Cohen officially lost his law license on Tuesday, he told the Oversight Committee \u2014 just over two months before he is due to report to prison for having lied to Congress. Cohen brought up the fact that he will not be allowed to practice law, when asked by Chairman Cummings if he understood how serious his admission was that he lied to Congress \u2014 especially as a lawyer. Cohen said yes \u2014 even though he is no longer a lawyer. Cohen\u2019s credibility is at issue during the hearing, as Republicans have sought to cast him as a thorough liar whose testimony cannot be trusted. Cohen has apologized \u2014 again on Wednesday \u2014 for lying to Congress, stating his latest testimony is an effort to correct the record and set things right. 10:55 a.m.: Lots of spectators, but no protesters  Cohen is the biggest name and closest affiliate of Trump\u2019s to appear before Congress since lawmakers started investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, and the crowds around Capitol Hill on Wednesday reflected the sensational nature of the hearing. Hundreds upon hundreds of would-be spectators lined the snaking halls of the Rayburn House Office Building \u2014 and were disappointed to be turned away as the committee gaveled in the start of the session. Among them were throngs of several dozen television camera crews. Even in the room, where things were supposed to be organized, dozens of photographers filled the space between Cohen and the lawmakers \u2014 whose staffers also jammed themselves into every extra space along the side walls to watch the proceedings. One thing noticeably missing? Protesters. The familiar sight outside high-profile congressional hearings and the court proceedings of Trump\u2019s affiliates was noticeably absent Wednesday. Outside a side entrance to the building, only one brightly dressed character held a sign for the line of spectators to view \u2014 and all it said was, \u201cThis is a sign.\u201d And inside the room, no one interrupted the proceedings \u2014 well, no one in the audience at least. 10:52 a.m.: The president\u2019s son responds Trump Jr. has offered his first response to Cohen\u2019s testimony on Twitter. He has not addressed any of Cohen\u2019s direct accusations, including Cohen\u2019s claim that he signed one of the checks to Cohen reimbursing him for his payments to Daniels. Instead, Trump Jr. brought the snark, tweeting, \u201cThis sounds like a breakup letter .\u2009.\u2009. and I\u2019m keeping your sweatshirt.\u201d 10:50 a.m.: Did Trump Jr. tell his father about the famous Trump Tower meeting? Trump and his son, Trump Jr., have repeatedly said that the latter never told his father that he accepted a meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016, after he was informed that she would bring dirt about Clinton. Cohen\u2019s testimony provides tantalizing hints of the possibility both have been lying \u2014 but nothing exactly definitive. Cohen recounted a conversation he alleges he observed \u201cprobably in early June 2016.\u201d He said that he was in Trump\u2019s office when Trump Jr. came in and walked behind his father\u2019s desk. Cohen said this was notable because people rarely walked behind Trump\u2019s desk. He testified that he heard Trump Jr. lean down and whisper to his father, \u201cThe meeting is all set.\u201d He alleged that Trump responded, \u201cOkay good \u2026 let me know.\u201d Cohen testified that when news of the meeting broke in 2017, he remembered the incident and decided it was likely a reference to the Trump Tower meeting. Bitingly, he added that he believed this was likely the case because \u201cMr. Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr. had the worst judgment of anyone in the world. And also, that Don Jr. would never set up any meeting of any significance alone and certainly not without checking with his father.\u201d Cohen\u2019s testimony finally provides a direct account from Trump\u2019s former lawyer of what he claims he knows \u2014 and doesn\u2019t know \u2014 about Trump\u2019s knowledge of the meeting. This became a major issue this summer, when CNN reported that Cohen had told investigators that he had evidence Trump Jr. informed his father of the meeting. Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Lanny Davis, was later identified as the source of that information. But Davis was forced to later revise his claims and said he\u2019d gotten things wrong about what Cohen knew. \u201cIt\u2019s a major mistake for which I am 100 percent sorry. Period. I never should have done it unless I was certain and could prove it,\u201d he told NBC News. 10:45 a.m.: Trump exaggerated his financial position, according to Cohen documents and testimony From 2011 to 2013, Trump exaggerated his financial position and the value of the properties he owned to obtain financing from lenders including Deutsche Bank, according to testimony and documents submitted to Congress by Cohen. The \u201cstatements of financial condition\u201d for Trump that Cohen submitted to Congress depict Trump as having between $170 million and $346 million in cash and marketable securities on hand. Trump attempted to use the documents to try to obtain a Deutsche loan to purchase the Buffalo Bills, Cohen said in his testimony, and to improve his ranking among lists of wealthy Americans. \u201cIt was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes,\u201d Cohen said. 10:40 a.m.: Cohen releases threatening letter to Fordham University Among the documents Cohen has provided to the committee is a letter to the president of Fordham University in New York, where Trump studied for two years before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania. In the letter, dated May 5, 2015 \u2014 about a month before Trump declared his candidacy for president \u2014 Cohen noted that media outlets had been asking for the release of Trump\u2019s college records. Cohen wrote to the university president that federal law requires the permission of a former student before the release of college records \u2014 and made clear that Trump\u2019s permission would not be forthcoming. Releasing the records, Cohen wrote, would open the school \u201cto both criminal and civil liability and damages including, among other things, substantial fines, penalties and even the potential loss of government aid and other funding.\u201d \u201cThe criminality will lead to jail time,\u201d Cohen went on to threaten, adding, \u201cWe will hold your institution liable to the fullest extent of the law including damages and criminality.\u201d He concluded by asking that the university contact him to confirm that Trump\u2019s records had been \u201cpermanently sealed.\u201d In his opening remarks, Cohen told the committee that he was instructed to write the letter to Fordham and Trump\u2019s other educational institutions by Trump. And he will note the irony: Trump was secretly instructing Cohen to bully and threaten people to ensure Trump\u2019s records, after engaging in a years-long campaign to press President Barack Obama to release documents about his background, including college transcripts. 10:30 a.m.: Cohen has begun reading from his prepared statement Cohen has begun reading from his prepared statement. You can read it in full here. 10:25 a.m.: Initial Republican salvo: Lanny Davis\u2019s orchestrated dishonesty Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the ranking Republican on the Oversight Committee, has opened with a fiery start. He called Cohen a \u201cfraudster, a liar and, in two months, a federal inmate\u201d and suggested history will look unkindly on Democrats\u2019 decision to hold their first oversight public hearing after taking over control of Congress in January with Cohen. Jordan asserted that the hearing may be the first time in history that a person convicted of lying to Congress, as Cohen was in November, has appeared before Congress again so quickly to once again offer testimony. And he alleged that the hearing \u2014 its timing, its topics, its audience \u2014 had all been orchestrated by Lanny Davis, a longtime friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton and now a lawyer for Cohen. Jordan told Cohen that he was acting as Democrats\u2019 \u201cpatsy\u201d at the hearing. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to find somebody somewhere to say some thing to remove the president from office,\u201d he said, before adding wryly, \u201cActually, they didn\u2019t find him. Lanny Davis did.\u201d Davis is seated directly behind Cohen, just over his right shoulder. 10:23 a.m.: Cummings warns Cohen: Lie and I will refer you to DOJ In fiery opening remarks, Chairman Cummings warned Cohen not to lie to committee members, or Cummings would refer him to federal law enforcement. \u201cI have made it abundantly clear to Mr. Cohen that if he comes here today and he does not tell us the truth, I will be the first one to refer those untruthful statements to DOJ,\u201d Cummings said, using an abbreviation for the Justice Department. He added later: \u201cHe does have a lot to lose if he lies.\u201d The warning is notable because Cohen already has been convicted of lying to Congress, and even Democrats concede there are questions about his credibility. But Cohen came to the hearing Wednesday armed with evidence to support some of his testimony, and Cummings said the testimony he will present is \u201cdeeply disturbing and it should be troubling to all Americans.\u201d \u201cWe will all have to make our own evaluation of the evidence, and Mr. Cohen\u2019s own credibility,\u201d Cummings said. 10:08 a.m.: Stone denies Cohen allegation that he talked with Trump about WikiLeaks July release Roger Stone, responding to Cohen\u2019s allegation that he talked with Trump in July 2016 about WikiLeaks releasing hacked Democratic emails, said in a text Wednesday: \u201cMr. Cohen\u2019s statement is not true.\u201d The denial could make the situation one of a he said-he said, as a person familiar with Cohen\u2019s testimony said Cohen does not have evidence, such as contemporaneous memorandums, to record the conversation he alleges to have heard between Stone and Trump. In November, Stone told The Washington Post that he had never spoken about WikiLeaks with Trump. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t come up,\u201d Stone told The Post. \u201cI am able to say we never discussed WikiLeaks. I\u2019m not sure what I would have said to him anyway because it\u2019s all speculation .\u2009.\u2009. I just didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not.\u201d 10:03 a.m.: The hearing is underway Cummings, the chair of the Oversight Committee, opened the hearing shortly after 10 a.m. Rep. Mark Meadows (R- N.C.) quickly asked for the hearing to be put off, because members had not been given the evidence Cohen presents in a timely fashion. 9:52 a.m.:  Despite written Cohen testimony, BuzzFeed stands by its story As noted in an earlier item, Cohen addressed in his written testimony an allegation by BuzzFeed News that he told the special counsel\u2019s office that Trump had directed him to lie to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow. Cohen seemed to dispute the reporting, saying in his written testimony, \u201cMr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That\u2019s not how he operates.\u201d But he also suggested he intuited what Trump wanted him to do, based on conversations they had during the campaign about the Trump Tower project. \u201cTo be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project,\u201d Cohen said in the prepared testimony. \u201cAnd so I lied about it, too \u2014 because Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress.\u201d In a statement Wednesday, BuzzFeed continued to stand by its story. \u201cMichael Cohen\u2019s public testimony reaffirms what he claimed in private to investigators, as we reported last month: President Trump directed him to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow in the heat of the 2016 campaign,\u201d spokesman Matt Mittenthal said. This post has been updated to correct the spelling of Matt Mittenthal\u2019s name.  9:18 a.m.: Evidence of yet another portrait Trump bought of himself According to written testimony distributed in advance, Cohen will allege that Trump asked him to arrange for purchase of a large portrait of Trump himself for $60,000 \u2014 and that Trump then repaid the bidder with money from Trump\u2019s own charitable foundation. Trump kept the art for himself. The Washington Post has previously reported about two portraits of himself that Trump bought with money from his charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation. This appears to be a third. Cohen\u2019s description matches news reports about a 2013 art auction in New York\u2019s Hamptons, in which a Trump friend named Stewart Rahr bought a nine-foot-tall portrait of Trump from artist William Quigley. The Hamptons news site Dan\u2019s Papers quoted Quigley then as saying the payment was $67,000, and that he picked the check up from Trump himself. If Cohen\u2019s account is true, the payment to Rahr was not mentioned in the Trump Foundation\u2019s IRS filings for 2013. Those filings show only a $60,000 payment from the Trump Foundation, but that was listed as going to the American Cancer Society. Rahr, Quigley and the American Cancer Society all declined to comment while The Post was reporting on Trump\u2019s charitable giving in 2016. The New York attorney general last year sued Trump and his foundation, alleging the charity engaged in \u201cpersistently illegal conduct.\u201d Among the allegations: Trump used charity funds to pay for two other portraits of himself. Tax law prohibits charity leaders from using nonprofit assets to buy things for themselves. In December 2018, Trump agreed that charity would be shut down. 8 a.m.: Cohen alleges Trump knew in advance of WikiLeaks email dump  Potentially the most explosive allegation that Cohen is expected to make is that Trump knew in advance of WikiLeaks\u2019s July 2016 release of DNC emails. According to Cohen\u2019s written testimony, he will say \u201che had just gotten off the phone with [WikiLeaks founder] Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201d It was in those days that WikiLeaks released a batch of DNC emails. Trump has previously denied talking about WikiLeaks with Roger Stone. \u201cMr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of \u2018wouldn\u2019t that be great,\u2019\u201d Cohen will say, according to his written remarks. Mueller has investigated extensively Stone\u2019s dealings, or attempted dealings, with WikiLeaks, and at Cohen\u2019s sentencing hearing, Jeannie Rhee, part of Mueller\u2019s prosecution team, told the judge that Cohen had provided \u201ccredible and reliable information about core Russia-related issues under investigation.\u201d The revelation Wednesday may offer a glimpse into what he might have shared with the special counsel. While Mueller\u2019s prosecutors have charged Stone with lying to Congress about his efforts to reach WikiLeaks, they have not alleged he criminally conspired with the group or with Russia to influence the outcome of the election. In June 2016, Julian Assange had talked publicly about having acquired damaging information on Hillary Clinton. WikiLeaks and Assange have said they never communicated with Stone, though during the campaign, Stone privately told associates that he was in contact with Assange, and that WikiLeaks had material that would be damaging to Clinton. In August 2016, he also boasted publicly of having communicated with Assange and \u2014 perhaps most notably \u2014 tweeted on Aug. 21: \u201cTrust me, it will soon the Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel.\u201d Six weeks later, WikiLeaks began posting another set of stolen emails from the account of Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta. A person familiar with Cohen\u2019s testimony said Cohen does not have evidence, such as contemporaneous memos, to support the assertion he will make about the phone call between Stone and Trump. In response to the testimony, WikiLeaks tweeted that the group \u201chad already publicly announced its pending publications and has always denied speaking to Roger Stone.\u201d 7:45 a.m. A check signed by Trump, and another signed by his son People familiar with Cohen\u2019s testimony had in recent days touted that he would release evidence connecting Trump to possible criminal conduct while in office. His written testimony makes clear what that evidence is. Cohen will provide a copy of a $35,000 check that he says was personally signed by Trump on Aug. 1, 2017, to reimburse him for paying off Stormy Daniels, an adult-film actress who had alleged having an affair with Trump. Cohen has admitted that \u2014 at Trump\u2019s direction \u2014 he paid the woman $130,000 in the waning days of the campaign so she would keep quiet about the affair, a payment that violated campaign finance laws. According to his written testimony, Cohen will effectively use the check to allege that the criminal wrongdoing in which he has implicated the president continued even after Trump took office. \u201cI am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank account on August 1, 2017 \u2014 when he was President of the United States \u2014 pursuant to the coverup, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me \u2014 the word used by Mr. Trump\u2019s TV lawyer \u2014 for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf. This $35,000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year \u2014 while he was President,\u201d Cohen will say, according to his written remarks. Cohen will also display a second $35,000 check, dated March 17, 2017, this one signed by Donald Trump Jr. and Trump organization chief operating officer Allen Weisselberg, a person familiar with his testimony said. The check offers the first evidence that the president\u2019s son may also have been involved with the reimbursement scheme. Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer, has previously acknowledged Trump reimbursed Cohen for the payments, though he has disputed the president violated campaign finance laws. He has also said, though, that he did not know when the president learned the nature of the payment to Daniels and that he only learned the full details after law enforcement raided Cohen\u2019s home in April. While it already had been clear that Cohen was implicating Trump in the campaign finance violations to which he pleaded guilty, his assertion that Trump was involved in a \u201ccoverup\u201d while president \u2014 backed by a check with Trump\u2019s writing on it \u2014 will be notable. Cohen will also allege that in February 2017, one month into his presidency, Trump assured him in the Oval Office that the reimbursement checks were on their way. 7:30 a.m.: \u2018He is a racist, he is a con man, he is a cheat\u2019 One of the notable aspects of Cohen\u2019s testimony is the extent to which he will air what he says are the president\u2019s personal and moral failings. According to his written remarks, he will call the president a \u201cracist,\u201d a \u201ccon man\u201d and a \u201ccheat,\u201d and describe personal anecdotes to back up his assertions. \u201cWhile we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way,\u201d Cohen will say, according to his written testimony. \u201cAnd, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.\u201d Cohen already had detailed those anecdotes in an interview with Vanity Fair in November, though his describing them again in a public setting could be politically damaging for the president. He will also allege other, petty actions he says the president took, including directing him \u201cto threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores.\u201d 7:15 a.m.: On the eve of the hearing, a personal attack In a sign of just how nasty the hearing will become, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) tweeted a lurid attack on Cohen on Tuesday alleging \u2014 without providing evidence \u2014 that he had affairs. \u201cDo your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she\u2019ll remain faithful when you\u2019re in prison. She\u2019s about to learn a lot...\u201d Gaetz tweeted. Trump and his defenders have relentlessly attacked Cohen ever since he agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with law enforcement, with the president even suggesting that Cohen\u2019s own father-in-law should be investigated. But even in that context, Gaetz\u2019s tweet was remarkably personal, foreshadowing what is likely be several days of blistering attacks on Cohen\u2019s credibility. Before the night was out, he would apologize in a second tweet. \u201cWhile it is important 2 create context around the testimony of liars like Michael Cohen, it was NOT my intent to threaten, as some believe I did. I\u2019m deleting the tweet & I should have chosen words that better showed my intent. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he wrote. Lanny J. Davis, an attorney for Cohen, said of Gaetz\u2019s comment: \u201cWe will not respond to Mr. Gaetz\u2019s despicable lies and personal smears, except to say we trust that his colleagues in the House, both Republicans and Democrats, will repudiate his words and his conduct. I also trust that his constituents will not appreciate that their congressman has set a new low \u2014 which in today\u2019s political culture is hard to imagine as possible.\u201d Earlier in the day, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had said in a statement, \u201cDisgraced felon Michael Cohen is going to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements. Sadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same. It\u2019s laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.\u201d 7 a.m.: What will Cohen say about the contentious BuzzFeed story?  Last month, BuzzFeed News leveled the explosive allegation that Cohen had claimed the president directed him to lie to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow, and that he had told the special counsel as much. The special counsel\u2019s office soon disputed that report. But Cohen had never addressed it publicly \u2014 until now. According to his written testimony, Cohen will tell lawmakers, \u201cMr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That\u2019s not how he operates.\u201d That would seem to refute BuzzFeed\u2019s report, which alleged \u201cthe president personally instructed him to lie \u2014 by claiming that negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did \u2014 to obscure Trump\u2019s involvement.\u201d The testimony is not totally surprising. If Cohen said BuzzFeed was right, that would raise significant questions about the credibility of the special counsel\u2019s office, which issued a rare public statement taking aim at the news outlet\u2019s reporting. Cohen will offer, according to his written testimony, that he felt Trump was sending him an implicit message he should lie \u2014 though he seemed to intuit that message from interactions he had with Trump many months before he testified, while Trump was still a candidate and the Trump Tower Moscow project was still being pursued. \u201cTo be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project. And so I lied about it, too \u2014 because Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress.\u201d That should be little solace to BuzzFeed, as it was all mostly public at the time it published its story. In court documents, Cohen\u2019s lawyers had said previously his lies \u201csprung regrettably from Michael\u2019s effort, as a loyal ally and then-champion\u201d of Trump. They also noted when he prepared his testimony, he was \u201cin close and regular contact with White House-based staff and legal counsel\u201d to Trump. 6:45 a.m.: Cohen will present Trump financial records Cohen is expected to present to lawmakers some Trump financial records \u2014 including three years of financial statements, from 2011-2013, which he gave to Deutsche Bank, according to his written testimony. He will allege that Trump \u201cinflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.\u201d That testimony could be particularly grating for the president, who has bristled in particular at the notion that his and his family\u2019s finances might be subjected to congressional or law enforcement scrutiny.","189":"The man who once derived his identity from making President Trump\u2019s problems go away turned on his former boss in stunning fashion Wednesday, alleging to Congress that Trump manipulated financial records, paid to cover up extramarital affairs and reacted with glee upon learning the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy organization would release emails damaging to his political opponent. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former fixer and personal lawyer, cast the president as a mendacious and petty racist who enlisted those around him to propagate a culture of deceit, in business, during his campaign and after winning the White House. In testimony before the House Oversight Committee, Cohen revealed how, in his view, Trump broke the law even as president, and he suggested ominously that federal prosecutors remain interested in a case involving the president. \u201cIs there any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven\u2019t yet discussed today?\u201d Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) asked. \u201cYes, and again, those are part of the investigation that\u2019s currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York,\u201d Cohen responded. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan declined to comment. Cohen hinted repeatedly at possible legal jeopardy for the president, saying he was willing to tell all now out of fear that if Trump were to lose the 2020 election, \u201cthere will never be a peaceful transition of power.\u201d \u201cMy loyalty to Mr. Trump has cost me everything,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI will not sit back, say nothing and allow him to do the same to the country.\u201d Some of Cohen\u2019s claims were backed by evidence, while others will hinge on his admittedly poor track record for reliability. Cohen is facing a three-year prison sentence that is scheduled to begin in May, in part for having lied previously to Congress. The president and his Republican allies sought to portray Cohen as a fabulist, disgruntled because Trump wouldn\u2019t give him a job in the White House and now hoping to get rich with a possible movie or book deal arising from specious claims about the president and those closest to him. \u201cYou\u2019re a pathological liar. You don\u2019t know truth from falsehood,\u201d said Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.), who also jeered Cohen with the schoolyard chant \u201cliar, liar pants on fire.\u201d \u201cNo one should ever listen to you and give you credibility,\u201d he added.","190":"Jeffrey P. Bezos has long guarded his personal privacy and that of his businesses with vehemence. Amazon kept major initiatives, such as the Kindle e-reader, secret for years. His space venture, Blue Origin, once had a rocket crash but didn\u2019t report the mishap for days. Visitors to the space company\u2019s headquarters have been routinely asked to sign nondisclosure agreements, even if just visiting for a holiday party. This quest for privacy imploded in recent weeks as Bezos, the world\u2019s wealthiest man and the owner of The Washington Post, faced perhaps the most personal crisis of his career. The National Enquirer published a series of stories, including intimate texts and photos, about his extramarital relationship with a former TV anchor, prompting Bezos and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie Bezos, to announce their planned divorce over Twitter. Then, according to a blog post Bezos published Thursday, the tabloid threatened to blackmail him with additional photographs of Bezos and the woman he was dating. He responded in the blog post by including copies of Enquirer emails detailing the alleged threat. The move revealed graphic descriptions of what the images showed. The\u00a0Enquirer on Friday said it had only been engaged in \u201cgood faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him\u201d and would investigate the claims by Bezos before taking \u201cwhatever appropriate action is necessary.\u201d The blog post Thursday night startled many in the technology industry and beyond, quickly spreading to internal online forums at Amazon, the company he founded in 1994 and for which he remains chief executive, board chairman and the largest shareholder. But some longtime associates and observers also considered his confrontation with the Enquirer to be a classic Bezos move. As Amazon\u2019s CEO, he has relished the chance to rewrite the script when it came to managing public relations. Perhaps even more so, he has thrived on seeking to vanquish rivals, whether they be corporate behemoths such as Walmart or upstarts such as Diapers.com. With the Enquirer, Bezos has twice seized the initiative by essentially scooping the tabloid, revealing news of his divorce and of the additional pictures before its reporters could. Even as the controversy has grown, Bezos has been spotted in public settings looking jovial, as he did when he appeared briefly on national television during the Super Bowl, standing and chatting near NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. He appeared last month at the annual dinner of the Alfalfa Club in Washington, a black-tie event that attracts some of the city\u2019s biggest names. \u201cHe is playing his hand as well as he can, given what has been made public,\u201d said Shel Kaphan, the first Amazon employee after Bezos and his wife. The \u201cdamage is done and I think he probably calculates correctly that it isn\u2019t going to get measurably worse for him if the photos come out.\u201d Kaphan added, \u201cIt would be very typical of Jeff to strategically weigh his options in a detached way and pick the one that would leave him in the best position or minimize further damage to him.\u201d Bezos, who declined an interview request made through Amazon officials Friday, typically is described as cerebral, ruthless and relentless as a businessman, with a particular ability to focus on long-term goals in the face of short-term pain. Bezos and his company have faced multiple controversies during his public life. In Amazon\u2019s early years, it faced skepticism over whether the company could ever turn a profit and survive. But he relentlessly focused on underpricing competitors and other customer innovations, earning the trust of investors that one day Amazon would make money. In 2015, when the New York Times published a detailed investigation describing a \u201cbruising\u201d workplace culture at Amazon, the company responded with a 1,300-word blog post detailing what the company argued were flaws in the story\u2019s reporting. Jay Carney, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for global corporate affairs and former press secretary to President Barack Obama, titled the response, \u201cWhat The New York Times Didn\u2019t Tell You,\u201d and engaged in an tit-for-tat exchange with the Times\u2019s executive editor over the coverage. In more recent years, as lawmakers have raised questions about whether Amazon was compensating its workers enough and other aspects of its business model, the company made announcements of plans to hire 100,000 new workers and, later, to introduce a $15 minimum wage. Amazon spent $14 million on lobbying last year, a record for the company. Bezos in recent years has raised his public profile. He bought The Post and the biggest home in Washington, and has appeared at entertainment award shows and high-profile rocket launches. He even drew attention for a more muscular physique and more refined wardrobe than earlier in his life. His ownership of The Post has led to clashes with candidate and now President Trump, who has argued that the Amazon founder bought The Post to advance his financial interests. When Trump was a candidate in December 2015 and criticized Bezos in several tweets, he replied on Twitter. \u201cFinally trashed by @realDonaldTrump. Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. #sendDonaldtospace.\u201d He largely has avoided further clashes with Trump, though he has said it is wrong of elected officials \u201cto demonize the media.\u201d Trump has from time to time continued to criticize Bezos. After the Enquirer published its article on Bezos\u2019s expected divorce, Trump tweeted, \u201cSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better & more responsible hands!\u201d In publicly challenging the Enquirer, Bezos gambled in a way that\u2019s rare in a corporate world where the more common approach could be to protect valuable businesses from controversies before they might spread in unpredictable ways. The stakes are particularly high for a man who has drawn the ire of an aggressive publisher that thrives on controversy and whose chief executive is David J. Pecker, a longtime friend of Trump. Pecker has received immunity from prosecution as part of the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into campaign finance violations by Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. Bezos wrote in the post on Medium, a self-publishing site, \u201cIf in my position I can\u2019t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?\u201d The accusations about the Enquirer\u2019s reporting came at a critical time for Bezos\u2019s empire, which increasingly has sought to work with the federal government. Amazon Web Services, which holds a $600 million cloud computing contract from the CIA, is vying for a $10 billion contract to build a cloud computing system for the Pentagon. Late last year, Blue Origin won its first major government contract, a $500 million deal from the Air Force to help develop its New Glenn rocket. \u201cAs a billionaire, he can afford to take the risk to respond this way,\u201d said Jim Lukaszewski, a crisis consultant based in Minneapolis. \u201cHe skipped all the steps that get people in trouble .\u2009.\u2009. This neutralizes the power of this predator.\u201d Bezos, who bought The Post in 2013 for $250 million, said in his online post Thursday that owning the news organization is \u201ca complexifier\u201d in his decisions about how to respond to political and other pressure. At a technology conference in 2016, he said that he admired Katharine Graham, the Post\u2019s late publisher who supported the newsroom\u2019s Watergate coverage even when a Nixon associate threatened that she was \u201cgonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer\u201d if a particular story was published. \u201cWith Kay Graham as my role model, I\u2019m very willing to let any of my body parts go through a big, fat ringer if need be,\u201d Bezos said at the conference. However this clash with the Enquirer turns out, it has revealed elements of Bezos\u2019s personality not widely known before, including a degree of personal indiscretion that has surprised longtime associates and observers. Bezos and his romantic partner, former TV anchorwoman Lauren Sanchez, appeared together in public, including at the Golden Globe Awards, before he publicly announced an end to his marriage to MacKenzie Bezos, a fiction writer who helped him found Amazon. The couple have four children together. While extramarital affairs are hardly novel, some Bezos watchers expressed surprise that he would send provocative text messages given the ease of copying and sharing them with others. Bezos amassed a fortune of more than $125 billion running a technology company at a time when such breaches of personal privacy were becoming routine. Bezos long has preached within Amazon that personal actions by employees \u2014 and there is no more visible one than Bezos \u2014 can reflect poorly on a company, said his biographer Brad Stone, author of \u201cThe Everything Store.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s kind of inexplicable considering his messages inside the company,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThis was somebody who has been careful and strategic about every move in his personal and professional life over 50-plus years.\u201d Once the affair was exposed, Bezos\u2019s response comes right out of the playbook of his longtime security consultant, Gavin de Becker. In \u201cThe Gift of Fear,\u201d he wrote that \u201cextortion is a crime of opportunity, usually committed by amateurs.\u201d De Becker added that when someone threatens to reveal marital infidelity, the best response is to say, \u201cHold on a moment, let me get my wife on the line and you can tell her right now.\u201d The immediate pain, he wrote, is better than a prolonged period of blackmail during which the damaging information may ultimately be revealed anyway. For much of his career, Bezos personally avoided the limelight, and the penchant for secrecy extended to his company and to his philanthropic endeavors. Until 2018, when he announced a $2 billion commitment to support preschoolers and the homeless, he had said very little about what he planned to do with his fortune. Bezos also is known for staying silent on quarterly earnings calls with analysts and investors, and the company has banned recording, typing and photography at its shareholder meetings. Reporters at such meetings were allowed only to take handwritten notes. \u201cI never think of us as secretive,\u201d Bezos once said at a meeting in response to questions about these practices. \u201cWe\u2019re just quiet. .\u2009.\u2009. We talk when we have something to say.\u201d Blue Origin, his space company, also has kept a low profile, even though space is one of his main passions and now comprises, as he has said, \u201cthe most important work I\u2019m doing.\u201d That included not revealing a 2011 crash until urged to by NASA, which had begun to worry about conspiracy theories spreading among those who noticed that something had gone awry. In the early 2000s, Bezos started quietly acquiring hundreds of thousands of acres in West Texas, where Blue Origin now launches its New Shepard rocket. He purchased the land under corporate entities named for explorers. There was Joliet Holdings and Cabot Enterprises, the James Cook and William Clark Limited Partnerships and Coronado Ventures. All were linked to a firm with a Seattle post office called Zefram LLC, named for Zefram Cochrane, a character in the Star Trek franchise. As he was scouting the land, a helicopter carrying Bezos crash-landed in a creek, flooding the cabin with water before he and others could escape. Later, he would say that \u201cit was harrowing. We were very lucky. I can\u2019t believe we all walked away from it.\u201d At the time, Amazon downplayed the crash, saying only that Bezos \u201cis fine. We\u2019re business as usual.\u201d","191":"It is a narrative ripped from a Hollywood script, and, fittingly, it includes actors. The 50 people charged Tuesday in a far-reaching college admissions conspiracy include the man who coached members of former president Barack Obama\u2019s family in tennis; an investor who founded a social impact fund with Bono; a bourbon distillery owner who is married to a former football player; and a former Harvard tennis player. The wealthy parents charged in the conspiracy to get their children into elite schools were more than just the 1 percent. They had connections at the highest levels, and when the ordinary benefits of extreme wealth failed to shape their children into elite college material, prosecutors said, they turned to William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, the man authorities say presided over a scheme to facilitate cheating on admission tests and bribery of college coaches to help children of wealthy parents get into prestigious universities. Here are some of the people charged Tuesday. After the University of Rhode Island hired him as head coach of the women\u2019s tennis team in 2018, Ernst was touted on the university\u2019s website as a New England Tennis Hall of Famer with 12 successful years coaching men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis at Georgetown University. Authorities said he made $950,000 promoting several students as potential tennis recruits for Georgetown \u2014 when they were not tennis players of that caliber. Linda Acciardo, a spokeswoman for the University of Rhode Island, said in a statement that the school had placed Ernst on administrative leave Tuesday after learning of the charges he is facing. He has not been involved in the recruitment of any current players, she wrote, nor in the signing of recruits. Ernst did not respond to messages seeking comment Tuesday. Rollice Ernst, his mother, said her son had enjoyed coaching Michelle and Malia Obama. (A spokeswoman for Michelle Obama did not respond to a message seeking comment.) Gordon Ernst played hockey and tennis at Brown University, Rollice Ernst said, graduating in 1990 after a semester off in Canada. The family didn\u2019t worry much about his or his brother\u2019s acceptance at Brown because Rollice Ernst\u2019s father was a graduate in 1949 and a big fundraiser and booster for the university, so she hoped their academic and athletic abilities would allow them to attend. She has been proud of him, she said: \u201cI still am.\u201d Rollice Ernst was reading about the case Tuesday, she said. \u201cThese colleges, they do whatever they want. They have so many slots that they give coaches, a certain number of slots they give coaches so they can recruit . .\u2009.\u2009. As soon as you put money into the equation, they get upset, apparently.\u201d When he left Georgetown, his lawyer assured him he did nothing illegal or immoral, Rollice Ernst said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see; you never know how these things turn out.\u201d When Palatella contacted Singer asking for help getting her son into the University of Southern California, she first asked whether she could just write a check for a generous donation, according to the criminal complaint. Singer provided her a price list but added it would not be enough: The best way to guarantee the boy\u2019s admission was to bribe a coach so the son could pose as a football recruit. That wouldn\u2019t have been all that far-fetched: Palatella\u2019s husband, Lou Palatella, is a former San Francisco 49er. He is not charged in the case. Later, Palatella allegedly told Singer that she and her husband \u201claugh every day\u201d over the scheme to get their son into USC. Palatella, of Hillsborough, Calif., is the owner of a craft bourbon distillery in Bardstown, Ky., outside Louisville. Palatella could not be reached for comment.   McGlashan might have been unknown to the public at large, but the people he worked with \u2014 Bono, Laurene Powell Jobs and Netflix founder Reed Hastings \u2014 are well known. The Silicon Valley investor worked with the trio and several others to create the Rise Fund, a social impact fund that has invested in educational and personal finance technology. He is also a senior manager at a global private equity firm and serves on the boards of several recognized brands, including e.l.f. cosmetics and Fender, the guitar maker, according to his biography on the website of the nonprofit Endeavor Global, where he is a board member. According to law enforcement, McGlashan conspired with Singer to get his son into USC by having him apply as a football recruit \u2014 even though McGlashan\u2019s son attended a high school without a football team. According to the criminal complaint, Singer told McGlashan that he would portray McGlashan\u2019s son as a kicker \u2014 since kickers sometimes get recruited from special camps outside their schools. McGlashan apparently laughed, according to the criminal complaint, which included a portion of their phone-tapped conversation. \u201cHe does have really strong legs,\u201d McGlashan said. McGlashan himself is the product of elite schools, receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree from Yale University and his MBA from Stanford. McGlashan could not be reached for comment.   When Singer wanted to deliver top test scores for the children of his clients, according to the criminal complaint, he brought in Riddell, who was then in charge of preparing students for college entrance exams at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla. Singer would arrange for Riddell, a 2004 graduate of Harvard, to take the tests for students with the aspiration but not the scores to gain admission to top schools. Riddell consistently delivered high scores. IMG Academy is a boarding school founded by a sports marketing firm that prepares elite athletes for top college programs or careers as professional athletes. The academy took Riddell\u2019s biography off its website. Before it was removed, it said the former college tennis player had helped \u201cthousands of students in gaining admissions to top American universities such as Stanford, Duke, Columbia, Dartmouth [and] University of Chicago.\u201d Neither Riddell nor IMG Academy could be reached for comment. There\u2019s a reason \u201cAunt Becky\u201d trended worldwide on Twitter for hours Tuesday \u2014 Loughlin\u2019s alleged crimes couldn\u2019t be more opposite from Becky Katsopolis, the wholesome role she played on ABC\u2019s 1990s sitcom \u201cFull House,\u201d as the wife of John Stamos\u2019s Uncle Jesse. Loughlin went on to have small roles on TV shows through the years, and was a series regular on CW dramas such as \u201cSummerland\u201d and \u201c90210.\u201d She found her niche starring in Hallmark Channel\u2019s \u201cGarage Sale Mystery\u201d movie franchise, for which she was executive producer, and has appeared in the channel\u2019s holiday movies from \u201cEvery Christmas Has a Story\u201d to \u201cNorthpole: Open for Christmas.\u201d She has been married to designer Mossimo Giannulli, who also was charged, since 1997. The Oscar-nominated Huffman\u2019s first breakout role was in Aaron Sorkin\u2019s dramedy \u201cSports Night\u201d in the late 1990s, in which she played an executive producer on a sports talk show. But she didn\u2019t become a true household name until 2004 with a starring role on ABC\u2019s \u201cDesperate Housewives,\u201d the network\u2019s massive hit centered on suburban women with many dark secrets. Huffman earned much critical acclaim for her role as Lynette, the former corporate executive turned stay-at-home mom to four kids, and she won the Emmy for lead actress in a comedy in 2005. About that time, her fame spiked further when she was nominated for an Academy Award for \u201cTransamerica,\u201d in which she starred as a transgender woman who discovered she has a long-lost son. She has been married since 1997 to actor William H. Macy, who was listed as \u201cspouse\u201d in the criminal complaint but not charged. Fashion designer Giannulli is best known for his first name, as the Mossimo clothing line is well known to shoppers at Target, where it was one of the store\u2019s most popular exclusive brands for years. (The store announced it was parting ways with the brand in 2017.)Giannulli, a California native, started the company as a beachwear line in 1987. He later expanded into casual wear and accessories, and the company became worth millions. Singer, 58, of Newport Beach, Calif., is described by authorities as the chief orchestrator of the alleged scams. Singer agreed to plea guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other counts in exchange for his cooperation with the investigation. He authored a 2014 book called \u201cGetting In: Gaining Admission to Your College of Choice,\u201d and is described on a promotional website as founder of a college counseling business called The Key. Using that business and a related foundation, authorities say, Singer persuaded parents to participate in schemes including cheating on the SAT and ACT and bribing college athletics coaches to designate applicants as recruited athletes so they would have a stronger chance of admission. Singer is identified in a criminal complaint as Cooperating Witness One, or CW-1. \u201cI can guarantee her a score,\u201d CW-1 tells a parent asking about college admission tests. The price: $75,000. Buckingham, 50, of Beverly Hills, Calif., is the founder and chief executive officer of Trendera, a marketing firm specializing in trend forecasting, brand strategy and generational research, according to the company website. It touts her as \u201cone of the foremost experts on Generations X, Y and Z.\u201d Buckingham did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Buckingham is also an author, whose books include \u201cThe Modern Girl\u2019s Guide to Sticky Situations.\u201d Federal authorities allege she paid $50,000 to have someone take the ACT on her son\u2019s behalf last year, sending a sample of his handwriting. In an excerpt of a wiretapped phone conversation, according to court documents, she said, \u201cYeah. I know this is craziness, I know it is. And then I need you to get him into USC, and then I need you to cure cancer and [make peace] in the Middle East.\u201d Vandemoer, 41, of Stanford, Calif., was in his 11th season as Stanford University\u2019s head sailing coach. Along with his many sailing victories, he had previously won an award for \u201crescuing many dinghy sailors that were caught in the vicious winds of a Chicago cold front,\u201d according to the university\u2019s website. Court documents include Singer telling a parent, \u201cSo I had a conversation with the Stanford sailing coach and, so I just gave the Stanford sailing coach [$]160,000 for his program and while we were having that conversation I said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m hoping that this 160 that I\u2019m helping you with helps secure a spot for next year. Can I be guaranteed a spot for next year?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u201d Vandemoer could not immediately be reached for comment, and his attorney, Robert Fisher, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. In a message to the campus, Stanford University\u2019s president, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, and provost, Persis Drell, called the allegations \u201cappalling.\u201d The coach was fired Tuesday morning, and pleaded guilty later that day in federal court to a racketeering count, the school officials noted. Investigators identified two prospective students who were potentially involved in the case, but neither wound up enrolling at Stanford, according to the school; one was denied admission, and another did not complete the application. The university has no information from the Justice Department investigation that the conduct involves anyone else at the school but said it will conduct an internal review to confirm that, according to a university statement. School officials also wrote that they will ensure Stanford does not benefit from the money given to the sailing program as part of the scheme, and are working with the government to redirect the money to an entity unaffiliated with the school.

Ross \u2014 one of the wealthiest members of President Trump\u2019s Cabinet \u2014 did not sell stock he held in a bank despite reporting otherwise, said Emory Rounds, director of the Office of Government Ethics. \u201cTherefore, OGE is declining to certify Secretary Ross\u2019s 2018 financial disclosure report,\u201d Rounds wrote in a letter dated Feb. 15, \u201cbecause that report was not accurate and he was not in compliance with his ethics agreement at the time of the report.\u201d Observers called the move highly unusual, and one told CNN that the office\u2019s decision amounted to \u201ca pretty giant red flag.\u201d Richard Painter, an ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, told the outlet that he has never seen a Cabinet member\u2019s disclosure form rejected in this way. In a statement Tuesday, Ross said he mistakenly believed he had sold the assets in question \u2014 100 shares of BankUnited stock \u2014 in May 2017. When he realized his error, he said, he sold the stock and disclosed the sale in October 2018. The shares, Ross said, were worth $3,700, an amount that federal regulations deem \u201cbelow the threshold of a possible conflict of interest.\u201d (According to a Bloomberg News report, that threshold is $15,000 for publicly traded securities.) \u201cTherefore, even if a BankUnited matter had come before the Department while I owned the shares \u2014 and I have not been made aware of any such matter \u2014 I would not have been disqualified from working on it,\u201d Ross said. He called the inaccuracy \u201cthe only known error in my annual report.\u201d In his letter, Rounds said his office had warned Ross before over his \u201cfailure to comply with his ethics compliance agreements\u201d and cautioned that \u201ceven inadvertent errors could undermine the public\u2019s trust in the Secretary and his Department\u2019s overall ethics program.\u201d Ross has repeatedly faced scrutiny over his investments, as lawmakers and outside groups have called for investigations into his finances. In 2018, Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, asked then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to review Ross\u2019s disclosures for \u201cpotential criminal violations.\u201d Ethics experts have said that, wrongdoing or not, government officials must avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. \u201cThe American people have entrusted @SecretaryRoss with power and authority so he can ensure the welfare of the American economy,\u201d tweeted Delaney Marsco, a lawyer with Campaign Legal Center, a public interest group. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have to wonder if he\u2019s making decisions for the benefit of the public or for his own pocketbook.\u201d Read more: White House says it will seek return of billions in federal funds for California rail line Racist comments cost Steve King his House committee roles.

Some described the prosecution as proof the church is no longer above the law, while others suspect Cardinal George Pell has been made a scapegoat for the church\u2019s sins. Pope Francis\u2019 former finance minister, who had been described as the third-highest ranking Catholic in the Vatican, has spent two weeks in a Melbourne remand jail cell since a sentencing hearing in the Victoria state County Court on Feb. 27 in which his lawyers conceded the 77-year-old must spend time behind bars. Pell had been convicted in December of orally raping a 13-year-old choirboy and indecently dealing with the boy and the boy\u2019s 13-year-old friend in the late 1990s, months after Pell became archbishop of Melbourne and initiated a compensation scheme for victims of clergy sexual abuse. A court order had prohibited media from reporting on the verdict until two weeks ago, when prosecutors abandoned a second trial on charges that Pell had groped two boys in a public swimming pool in the 1970s. Chief Judge Peter Kidd will sentence Pell on five convictions, each carrying a potential 10-year maximum sentence. Most of the sentences for each conviction are likely to be served concurrently. Pell\u2019s sentence will also reflect court standards of two decades ago, when his crimes were committed. In those days, judges placed less weight on the damage done to children by sexual abuse. In an unusual move for an Australian court that acknowledges intense international interest in the case, the judge will allow his sentencing remarks to be broadcast on live television. After centuries of impunity, cardinals from Australia to Chile and points in between are facing justice in both the Vatican and government courts for their own sexual misdeeds or for having shielded abusers under their watch. Last week, France\u2019s senior Catholic cleric, Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, was convicted of failing to report a known pedophile priest to police. He was given a six-month suspended sentence. Francis last month defrocked the onetime leader of the American church after an internal investigation determined Cardinal Theodore McCarrick sexually molested children and adult men. It was the first time a cardinal had been defrocked over the child abuse scandal. Pell has denied any wrongdoing and will appeal his convictions at the Victoria Court of Appeal on June 5. His lawyers canceled an application to keep him free on bail before then. The appeal grounds include that the \u201cverdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported\u201d by the evidence of more than 20 witnesses who testified, including clerics, choristers and altar servers. \u201cIt was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of the complainant alone,\u201d the filings said. That view has been expressed in some sections of the media. \u201cPell was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt on the uncorroborated evidence of one witness, without forensic evidence, a pattern of behavior or a confession,\u201d veteran crime reporter John Silvester wrote in Melbourne\u2019s The Age newspaper. \u201cPell has become a lightning rod on the worldwide storm of anger at a systemic cover-up of priestly abuses. But that doesn\u2019t make him a child molester,\u201d Silvester added. An Australian academic who wrote an opinion piece describing Pell\u2019s \u201caccusers\u201d as \u201cwicked\u201d last week apologized for the article, which was published in a Catholic monthly newspaper that was later pulled by the church. \u201cPell is a tough man and he will, by the grace of God, survive the wickedness of his accusers and the silence of many who should defend him but won\u2019t,\u201d Tasmania University think-tank director David Daintree wrote in the Tasmania-based Catholic Standard newspaper. In his written apology issued by the Hobart Archdiocese, Daintree said, \u201cIt was never my intention to cast doubt on survivors.\u201d Sky News Live, an Australian cable and satellite television station, protected advertisers\u2019 reputations by removing all ads from prominent conservative commentator Andrew Bolt\u2019s nightly program after he flagged he would be venting his own misgivings about the verdict. \u201cPell could well be an innocent man who is being made to pay for the sins of his church and made to pay after an astonishing campaign of media vilification,\u201d Bolt said. The judge, prosecutor and defense lawyer repeatedly told both Pell\u2019s juries that they must not make Pell a scapegoat for the church. The first trial ended in a deadlocked jury and the second jury delivered unanimous guilty verdicts. Judge Kidd told the sentencing hearing last month, \u201cThe Catholic Church is not on trial ... I\u2019m imposing sentence on Cardinal Pell for what he did.\u201d Pell is guilty as charged in the eyes of many who have been quick to distance themselves from the cardinal since the convictions were made public. Melbourne\u2019s Richmond Football Club quickly dropped Pell as the Australian Rules Football team\u2019s honorary ambassador. Pell was contracted to the club as a budding professional footballer in 1959 before he joined the priesthood. St. Patrick\u2019s College, the prestigious Catholic school where Pell was educated in his hometown of Ballarat, announced that a building named after him would be renamed and Pell would be removed from the school honor board. \u201cThe jury\u2019s verdict demonstrates that Cardinal Pell\u2019s behaviors have not met the standards we expect of those we honor as role models for the young men we educate,\u201d headmaster John Crowley said. But the Australian Catholic University said its Pell Center at its Ballarat campus would not be renamed until the appeal process was completed, angering academic staff. The university\u2019s president, Greg Craven, and former Prime Minister John Howard are among 10 prominent Australians whose character references were submitted to Judge Kidd to take into consideration when deciding an appropriate sentence. Sydney Archbishop Anthony Fisher told a congregation on the first Sunday after the convictions were made public that they should withhold judgment on Pell until the appeal. \u201cIf we are too quick to judge, we can end up joining the demonizers or the apologists, those baying for blood or those in denial,\u201d Fisher said. Fisher, a former lawyer, holds the church post in Australia\u2019s largest city that Pell held before he was elevated to the Vatican. In the Vatican, Pell is facing a church investigation that could lead to his removal from the priesthood. When Australian Archbishop Philip Wilson last year became the most senior Catholic cleric ever found guilty of covering up child sex abuse, he initially refused to resign pending an appeal. But Wilson quit two months later after then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called on Pope Francis to fire him. Wilson\u2019s conviction was eventually quashed on appeal in December, but he has not been reinstated to his former role. Current Prime Minister Scott Morrison is willing to hold off acting on Pell until his appeal is settled. A petition with more than 130,000 signatures has called for Pell to be stripped of an Australian honor awarded in 2005 for his service to the church, education and social justice. \u201cI was appalled and shocked,\u201d Morrison said of the convictions. \u201cI think any Australian would be to read of those events, but it shows that no one is above the law in this country.\u201d","194":"THE PROGNOSIS Sen.

(Jim Young\/Getty Images) Drug company executives indicated last week they would be willing to slash their prices if they no longer were forced to pay middlemen the kind of discounts that many blame for driving up the cost of prescription drugs for consumers. Now, a first-term Republican senator is trying to turn that pledge into a reality with a new bill banning the practice of \"rebates\" in which drugmakers pay middlemen in the confusing drug-pricing chain to make sure their drugs are covered by insurers.\u00a0Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) this week\u00a0introduced a measure to end rebates negotiated between drugmakers and\u00a0pharmacy benefit managers\u00a0in transactions conducted in\u00a0the private sector.  The proposal\u00a0would do for private health\u00a0plans\u00a0what the Trump administration has already proposed doing for\u00a0government-sponsored health plans as the president has publicly taken aim at drug prices, to mixed results so far. The Health and Human Services Department in January\u00a0announced draft rules\u00a0allowing drug companies to offer discounted prices directly to consumers, aiming to stop the controversial rebate practice.\u00a0But those rules would apply only to Medicare drug plans and Medicaid managed-care plans. Braun\u2019s bill would ban rebates in\u00a0all private plans, including employer-sponsored ones. When the administration's proposal was announced, HHS Secretary Alex Azar encouraged lawmakers to \u201cget to work on extending this proposal to the commercial market, too.\u201d Here, Braun has done just that. \u201cIn an effort to lower drug prices, President Trump\u2019s HHS is exposing the hidden system of kickbacks to middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs),\u201d Braun said in a statement to The Health 202. \u201cI believe Secretary Azar will support this basic measure that amplifies his efforts to provide greater drug price transparency.\u201d\u00a0 Braun told reporters he believes drug companies will get on board with his plan because they know the rebate system \"doesn't make sense.\"\u00a0 During last week\u2019s testimony by drug executives\u00a0before the Senate Finance Committee, Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa)\u00a0asked whether their companies would lower prices if the Trump rule applying to public-sector plans is ultimately implemented.\u00a0\u00a0 The executives were reluctant to make firm commitments, but some signaled they would be willing to lower prices if rebates were banned in the private sector, too. \u201cIf the rebates were removed from the commercial sector as well, we would definitely reduce our list prices,\u201d AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot told Grassley. In a statement to The Health 202, the company reiterated Soriot\u2019s remarks, saying that if rebates for both private and public plans were eliminated, \u201cwe are prepared to reduce list prices by an equivalent amount of rebates less appropriate market based fees to those in the supply chain.\u00a0This would reduce overall costs to patients and the government.\" Merck head Kenneth Frazier told lawmakers he would \u201cexpect our prices would go down if we changed the system again, on the commercial side as well as the Medicare side.\u201d During the hearing, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u00a0chief executive Giovanni Caforio said he shared the same position. After\u00a0a follow-up question, Bristol-Myers Squibb said it remains \u201ccommitted to working with Congress and the Administration on reforming the rebate system with a focus on what is best for patients.\u201d After the\u00a0hearing,\u00a0Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the committee's ranking Democrat,\u00a0called on the seven drug executives to answer in writing whether they would commit to lowering list prices if rebates went down. \u201cBig Pharma is eager to point the finger at the middlemen, and now is their chance to follow through on their promises to be a part of the solution,\u201d Wyden said in a statement last week. David Mitchell, president and founder of Patients for Affordable Drugs, was skeptical, however.\u00a0He said while Braun\u2019s bill is a step in the right direction, without specific provisions to require list price reductions, \u201cwe cannot trust the drug companies to voluntarily lower list prices.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s say a drug is $100 and a rebate is $30. If rebates go away, first we have to compel the drug companies to bring the price to $70, then we have to make sure they don\u2019t start raising prices again willy-nilly,\u201d Mitchell told me.\u00a0 And the much-villainized middlemen, a trade group for the PBMs, said it would work with lawmakers but pointed the finger at those who pay them the rebates to begin with: drug companies. \"[T]he legislation appears to do absolutely nothing to address the root cause of the problem: high list prices that only the drug manufacturers have the power to set,\"\u00a0J.C. Scott, president of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, told The Health 202 in a statement. \"Despite drug manufacturers\u2019 rhetoric, their pricing strategies are unrelated to the rebates they negotiate with PBMs.\" Mitchell said the bill still\u00a0highlights the \u201cbipartisan energy\u201d around addressing skyrocketing drug costs. And Rachel Sachs, an associate professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis, said the GOP senator's proposal puts the onus on drug companies to act. Drug companies have been \u201cvery successful in demonizing PBMs over the last few years,\u201d she told me. \u201cNow that it looks like Congress is thinking about giving the pharmaceutical industry what they have asked for on PBMs, the pharmaceutical industry needs to step up to the plate and make serious concessions, or they may face more extreme reactions from Congress.\u201d Braun\u00a0said his bill, dubbed the Drug Price Transparency Act can start to bring transparency to an industry that has \u201cgiven us a system that is as broken as one can be.\u201d \u201cThis bill doesn\u2019t outlaw PBMs.\u00a0It doesn\u2019t even outlaw rebates. What it\u2019s going to do is shed light on the process so they\u2019re not going to be able to get by with the argument that there\u2019s room for a whole other layer of a middleman,\u201d Braun said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need it.\" Food and Drug Commissioner Scott Gottlieb\u00a0is stepping down after nearly two years leading the agency's response to a host of public health challenges. (J. Scott Applewhite\/AP) AHH: Food and Drug Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who spearheaded a crackdown on including youth vaping and\u00a0opioid addiction, is resigning from his post\u00a0and will leave the Trump administration in about a month.  Gottlieb said the decision was made to spend more time with his family, who still live\u00a0in Connecticut, our Post colleagues Laurie McGinley, Lenny Bernstein and Josh Dawsey report. Gottlieb\u00a0has been commuting back and forth weekly from Washington to his Westport home. \u201cThe resignation was not sought by the White House,\u201d our colleagues write. \u201cA senior White House official said Gottlieb had spoken to President Trump, and that the president liked the FDA chief and did not want him to leave. While Gottlieb had some policy disagreements with the White House, he is well respected, and could even be asked to take another post, said two officials.\u201d \u201cIt was a very hard decision,\u201d Gottlieb told our colleagues. \u201cThis is the best job I will ever have. I\u2019m leaving because I need to spend time with my family. I get home late Friday, work on weekends and come back to Washington on Sunday. I did the job 100 percent.\" Trump tweeted about his outgoing FDA commissioner yesterday: Gottlieb\u2019s resignation was a surprise to some top officials at the agency. And it comes as the issue of youth vaping, which he has aimed to tackle, is being reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget. \u201cThe blueprint is expected to move forward, but Gottlieb\u2019s departure could throw into question other controversial tobacco initiatives he championed that have not yet emerged from the FDA, including proposals to ban menthol cigarettes and to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes to \u2018minimally addictive\u2019 levels,\u201d our colleagues write. An HHS spokeswoman told The Post there is no information yet on who would take over the post on either an acting or permanent basis. From Gottlieb:\u00a0 From Sachs:\u00a0 Sen.\u00a0Dick Durbin\u00a0(D-Ill.): Farzad Mostashari, a former health information chief during the Obama administration: OOF: During a Senate hearing during in which witnesses calling for a national campaign to counter the anti-vaccine movement amid a measles outbreak, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he doesn\u2019t believe the government should require people to get vaccinated.  The Kentucky Republican and physician has made similar comments before, our Post colleague Felicia Sonmez reports, ahead of his unsuccessful bid for president in 2016. But Paul\u00a0was the only lawmaker to strike a defiant tone during Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cIt is wrong to say that there are no risks to vaccines. Even the government admits that children are sometimes injured by vaccines .\u2009.\u2009. I still don\u2019t favor giving up on liberty for a false sense of security,\u201d he said. He acknowledged unvaccinated people could spread diseases\u00a0but claimed \u201cthere doesn\u2019t seem to be enough evidence of this happening to be reported as a statistic.\u201d Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who is also a physician, rebutted his colleague\u2019s comments. \u201cLet me give some color to what Sen. Paul said,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cYou may or may not know that I\u2019m a physician. And I\u2019ve seen people who have not been vaccinated, who require liver transplantation because they were not ... Or ended up with terrible diseases if for no other reason that they didn\u2019t understand vaccination was important.\u201d Cassidy said there should be repercussions for parents who don\u2019t follow state vaccination requirements for their school-aged children. Our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports, the 18-year-old Ohio high school student who got a vaccination after challenging his mother\u2019s anti-vaxx stance \u201cattracted the most attention.\u201d Ethan Lindenberger said his mother depended on false information from anti-vaccine groups rather than from health officials. \u201cThese sources that spread misinformation should be the primary concern of the American public,\u201d he said during the hearing, calling on health officials to use personal stories as a way to stop the spread of inaccurate messaging. \u201cWhen you convince parents, not that information is incorrect, but that their children are at risk, that\u2019s a much more substantial way to get people to change their minds.\u201d OUCH: The Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the American Medical Association have filed a lawsuit challenging a new federal rule that looks to block clinics from referring low-income women for abortions. In a Tuesday filing in the U.S. District Court in Oregon, the groups argued the Trump administration\u2019s rule would \u201cviolate patients\u2019 rights, force doctors to withhold information and harm the 4 million patients who rely on the Title X program for their health care,\u201d our Post colleague Ariana Eunjung Chat reports. The rule could shift tens of millions of dollars away from organizations such as Planned Parenthood and toward faith-based and antiabortion clinics. One day earlier, California and a separate group of 20 states announced suits on similar grounds, Ariana adds. \u201cBecause of the administration\u2019s overreach and interference in health-care decision-making, physicians will be prohibited from having open, frank conversations with their patients about all their health care options,\u201d AMA President Barbara L. McAneny said in a statement. Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen called the rule \u201cunethical, illegal and dangerous.\u201d Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), chair of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations: \u2014 In the biggest advance for depression in years, the FDA approved a new antidepressant meant for people with intractable depression who don\u2019t\u00a0respond to other treatments. The novel treatment, a nasal spray called esketamine, is derived from an old anesthetic, ketamine, which was once popular as a\u00a0party drug called Special K, our Post colleagues Laurie and Carolyn Y. Johnson report. The new antidepressant \u201chas been eagerly anticipated by psychiatrists and patient groups as a powerful new tool to fight intractable depression\u201d our colleagues write. \u201cThe spray acts within hours, rather than weeks or months as is typical for current antidepressants, and could offer a lifeline to about 5 million people in the United States with major depressive disorder who haven\u2019t been helped by current treatments. That accounts for about one in three people with depression.\u201d The drug will include a black box warning, which is the most severe safety warning the agency issues. The warning will \u201ccaution users they could experience sedation and problems with attention, judgment and thinking, and that there\u2019s potential for abuse and suicidal thoughts,\u201d Carolyn and Laurie write. \u201cPeople who take esketamine will have to be monitored for at least two hours after receiving a dose to guard against some of these side effects.\u201d \u201cThere are risks associated with the drug, but I think the benefits here probably outweigh those,\u201d said Lee Hoffer, a medical anthropologist at Case Western Reserve University who was a member of the FDA advisory panel that recommended the drug\u2019s approval. Today President Trump signs executive order to address veteran suicide:","195":"With Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0During his State of the Union on Jan. 30, 1974, seven months before he resigned, Richard Nixon appealed to Congress to stop probing him and his reelection campaign. \u201cI believe the time has come to bring that investigation and the other investigations of this matter to an end,\u201d he said. \u201cOne year of Watergate is enough.\u201d Forty-five years later, speaking on Tuesday night from the same spot, President Trump warned House Democrats in ominous terms against using their new subpoena power to investigate him. \u201cAn economic miracle is taking place in the United States \u2014 and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations,\u201d Trump said, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi over his left shoulder. \u201cIf there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. \u2026 We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.\u201d What the president presented, of course, is a false choice. The economy boomed in the late 1990s during a period of peace and prosperity as House Republicans investigated, and impeached, Bill Clinton. Trump didn\u2019t seem too worried about the impact of his birther crusade on the nation\u2019s health when Barack Obama was president. When they had gavels during the Obama years, House Republicans believed they had a constitutional imperative to conduct vigorous oversight of the executive branch. Many headlines this morning, just as in the previous two years, emphasize Trump\u2019s plea for both parties to come together. But the president\u2019s call for an end to the \u201cpolitical stalemate\u201d last night sounded hollow to Democrats just eight weeks after he declared that he would be \u201cproud\u201d to shut down the government to get a border wall. This brinkmanship led to the longest partial government shutdown in American history and continues to create uncertainty as a new funding deadline looms on Feb. 15. -- Teleprompter Trump never lasts. Twitter Trump always returns. The president erratically jumped between the discordant roles of unifier and disrupter. There weren\u2019t great signposts or transitions between topics, which often made the 82-minute address sound as though it had been written by committee. (There can be no doubt, though, that Stephen Miller was the main author.) \u201cJust eight hours earlier, Trump trashed Democrats \u2014 as well as ... John McCain \u2014 at a freewheeling lunch with television news anchors,\u201d Phil Rucker and Toluse Olorunnipa report. \u201cThe president remarked that the late senator\u2019s final book, a capstone to his life in public service, \u2018bombed.\u2019 He assailed Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) as a \u2018nasty son of a bitch,\u2019 ridiculed former vice president Joe Biden as \u2018dumb\u2019 for his history of gaffes, and accused Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) of \u2018choking like a dog\u2019 at a news conference where he denied being in a racist photo on his medical school yearbook page.\u201d -- Looking to 2020, Trump is again singing his greatest hits from 2016. He\u2019s like a band that struggles to play new material because the fans always want to hear the classics. He opened with paeans to unity and harked back to inspiring examples of American greatness, but he got elected promising disruption. The meat of the speech was devoted to the issues that animated his upset victory in the GOP primaries and then over Hillary Clinton. And he kept going back to the set that worked: protectionism, nativism and isolationism. His calls for rebuilding infrastructure and lowering prescription drug prices were also staples of his stump speech as a candidate. Trump is ever mindful of delivering for his base. He mentioned early on that he\u2019s delivered for \u201cthe blue-collar workers\u201d who supported him. Referring to NAFTA as a \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d he name-checked the 2020 battlegrounds of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania that will likely determine whether he secures a second term. He contrasted \u201cthe working class\u201d and \u201cthe political class.\u201d -- The president who spoke of \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in his inaugural address showed again that his brand will always be \u201ccrisis.\u201d  Trump did not declare a national emergency to allow for the unilateral, and possibly unlawful, construction of the wall he has promised Mexico would pay for. But he kept the door open to it, as he employed characteristically dark rhetoric to announce that he\u2019s deployed more troops to stop the \u201conslaught\u201d from a caravan of migrants. Our graphics team visualized the words Trump used last night that no president has ever before uttered during a State of the Union. Among them: bloodthirsty, sadistic, venomous and chilling. \u201cThe lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all Americans,\u201d Trump declared. \u201cWe have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.\u201d -- The speech \u201conce again was chock-full of stretched facts and dubious figures,\u201d write fact-checkers Glenn Kessler, Sal Rizzo and Meg Kelly. \u201cMany of these claims have been fact-checked repeatedly, yet the president persists in using them.\u201d Their story identifies 30 comments that weren\u2019t correct, and many relate to immigration: \u201cBy any available measure, there is no new security crisis at the border. \u2026 Apprehensions of people trying to cross the southern border peaked most recently at 1.6 million in 2000 and have been in decline since, falling to just under 400,000 in fiscal 2018. The decline is partly because of technology upgrades; tougher penalties in the wake of the 9\/11 terrorist attacks; a decline in migration rates from Mexico; and a sharp increase in the number of Border Patrol officers. \u2026 \u201cTrump exaggerates the link between immigration and crime; almost all research shows legal and illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population. \u2026 The consensus among economic research studies is that the impact of immigration is primarily a net positive for the U.S. economy and to workers overall, especially over the long term.\u201d -- \u201cTrump\u2019s comments on illegal immigration elicited groans, leading Pelosi to raise her hand in an attempt to quiet her members. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a former Somali refugee, listened while holding her head in her hands,\u201d Elise Viebeck and Paul Kane note. -- Like other presidents who have faced divided government, including Nixon, Trump has devoted more attention to foreign policy as his term has gone on. Obama did the same thing in 2011 after Republicans won the House. There\u2019s less room for big domestic policy gains, so the focus becomes more international. He touted negotiations with the Taliban to seek a peaceful settlement that would allow the United States to withdraw from Afghanistan. Imagine how apoplectic certain conservatives would have been if Obama had spoken to Congress about opening a dialogue with the Taliban. He also announced that he will have a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam on Feb. 27 and 28. \u201cIf I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea,\u201d Trump said, dubiously. \u201cMuch work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.\u201d -- Trump also sought to juice his standing with social conservatives by talking in stark terms about abortion. He no longer has a looming Supreme Court vacancy to keep evangelicals in line. Instead, he called for new national restrictions on women\u2019s reproductive rights during the third trimester. -- The moment that will wind up being remembered most vividly years from now came when Trump engaged with the dozens of Democratic congresswomen who were wearing white. \u201cAll Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before,\u201d the president said, \u201cand exactly one century after the Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.\u201d Wearing white, the color of the suffragists, the new female members high-fived one another and started a chant of \u201cU-S-A.\u201d If you were making a documentary about female candidates in 2018, it would be a fitting final scene as the credits roll. -- Hey, big spender: Trump didn\u2019t even make a rhetorical nod to the need for fiscal responsibility. The ballooning national debt will be a core element of Trump\u2019s legacy. It\u2019s a story line that, at least for now, continues to be under-covered. But Trump did not mention the deficit or the debt once. When the president previewed the speech for a group of supporters on Monday night, one of his allies asked whether he would discuss the deficit. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney interjected. \u201cNobody cares,\u201d Mulvaney said, per ABC News. Instead, Trump called for major new spending to eradicate HIV and develop new cancer treatments for children. Those are laudable goals, for sure, but he never talked about how he\u2019s going to pay for them. Instead, he boasted about cutting taxes, which has reduced revenue and forced the Treasury to essentially borrow more money from places like China. All of it will need to be paid back \u2014 with interest. Trump also indirectly warned that the United States might engage in a costly nuclear buildup after withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia. \u201cPerhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can\u2019t \u2014 in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far,\u201d Trump said, not giving a price tag. Unlike previous Republican presidents, Trump neglected to mention entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Other big issues Trump didn\u2019t touch included climate change, transgender rights, gun control, voting rights, forcible family separations and Puerto Rican hurricane recovery. -- But instant polls conducted after the speech showed that a significant majority of viewers approved of Trump\u2019s address. A CBS News poll found 76 percent of Americans who tuned in approved of what they saw, compared with 24 percent who disapproved. A CNN-SSRS poll showed the audience skewed Republican, with the viewership representing the most partisan tilt in any similar CNN instant poll dating to 2001. \u201cViewers were roughly 17 points more likely than the general public to identify as Republicans, and were largely fans of the President,\u201d CNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta reports. \u201cIn pre-speech surveys, 61% of speech-watchers said they approved of the job he was doing as President, compared with 40% in CNN's latest representative survey of all American adults.\u201d -- More WaPo team coverage: -- Commentary from the opinion page: WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- The Post has uncovered a 1986 registration card for the State Bar of Texas showing that Elizabeth Warren listed herself as \u201cAmerican Indian.\u201d\u00a0In an interview,\u00a0the Democratic senator said she apologizes for ever identifying as Native American. Annie Linskey and Amy Gardner report: \u201cHer comments more fully explain the regret she expressed last week to the chief of the Cherokee Nation, the first time she\u2019s said she was sorry for claiming American Indian heritage. \u2026 But as Warren undergoes increased scrutiny as a presidential candidate, additional documents could surface to keep the issue alive. Using an open records request during a general inquiry, for example, The Post obtained Warren\u2019s registration card for the State Bar of Texas, providing a previously undisclosed example of Warren identifying as an \u2018American Indian.\u2019 Warren filled out the card by hand in neat blue ink and signed it. Dated April 1986, it is the first document to surface showing Warren making the claim in her own handwriting. Her office didn\u2019t dispute its authenticity.\u201d Billionaire Joe Ricketts, whose family owns the Chicago Cubs, apologized for exchanging racist emails. (Nati Harnik\/AP) GET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b Neomi Rao testifies during a Senate Judiciary confirmation hearing. (Zach Gibson\/Getty Images) THE #METOO MOVEMENT: -- Neomi Rao, Trump\u2019s nominee to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the second-most-powerful court in the country, addressed her controversial writings on date rape during her confirmation hearing. Ann E. Marimow reports: \u201cShe also encountered resistance Tuesday from Republican Sen. Joni Ernst (Iowa), who recently disclosed that she had been sexually assaulted while in college. Rao\u2019s writings from the 1990s on date rape \u2018do give me pause,\u2019 Ernst said during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. The senator said she is concerned about the message Rao\u2019s columns send to young women \u2018about who is to blame\u2019 and has not decided whether to back Rao\u2019s nomination. \u2018I really want to know more,\u2019 Ernst said in an interview. Rao told senators that she cringes \u2018at some of the language I used\u2019 in columns she wrote as an undergraduate at Yale. \u2018I like to think I\u2019ve matured as a thinker, writer and a person,\u2019 she said. And Rao emphasized that \u2018nobody should blame the victim.\u2019\u201d -- Pope Francis confirmed that some Catholic clergy members sexually abused nuns. Max J. Rosenthal and Michelle Boorstein report: \u201c\u2018It\u2019s not that everyone does this, but there have been priests and bishops who have,\u2019 Francis told reporters aboard the papal plane on Tuesday ... Francis is due to host a gathering of bishops and cardinals in two weeks to address the broader global issue of clergy sexual abuse \u2014 including, largely for the first time, of adult victims and accountability for those at the top of the church who mismanage and cover it up.\u201d -- Two women accused the former president of Costa Rica, Nobel laureate \u00d3scar Arias S\u00e1nchez, of sexual misconduct. Kevin Sieff reports: \u201cThe allegation was reported Tuesday by Semanario Universidad, a local newspaper, and the New York Times. In interviews with both publications, the accuser explained that, at one of her meetings with Arias, he approached her from behind, touched her breasts and penetrated her with his fingers. She filed a criminal complaint against Arias this week. In a second allegation, Emma Daly, the head of communications at Human Rights Watch, told The Washington Post in an interview Tuesday that Arias groped her in 1990, when she was a reporter covering Central America and while he was still president.\u201d -- The D.C. private school St. Albans has launched an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct perpetrated by former\u00a0teachers. Justin Wm. Moyer reports: \u201cSt. Albans School in Northwest Washington announced in a letter to the school community this week that it will launch the investigation after \u2018firsthand accounts of inappropriate behavior and sexual misconduct by former St. Albans teachers.\u2019 The letter indicated there is no evidence of recent misconduct at the prestigious all-boys school. In August, The Washington Post reported allegations that teacher Vaughn Keith sexually abused a student at Key School, in Annapolis, in the 1970s and was fired for alleged sexual misconduct. Keith went on to teach Latin and classical history at St. Albans for six years in the 1980s.\u201d -- A Kansas judge sparked outrage after he described two sexual abuse victims in their early teens as \u201can aggressor\u201d in their assaults. Kristine Phillips reports: \u201c\u2018I do find that the victims in this case are more of an aggressor than a participant in the criminal conduct,\u2019 Leavenworth County District Judge Michael Gibbens said during a recent sentencing hearing just outside of Kansas City, Kan. \u2026 The defendant is Raymond Soden, a 67-year-old man who was arrested last year after, prosecutors said, he used social media to solicit sex from the minors. Soden reached a deal with the Leavenworth County Attorney\u2019s Office, and in December, was sentenced to five years in prison \u2014 about eight years short of the minimum punishment recommended in the state\u2019s sentencing guidelines.\u201d THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Federal prosecutors are seeking interviews with Trump Organization executives. CNN\u2019s Erica Orden and Cristina Alesci report: \u201cTrump and his legal team have long harbored concerns that investigations by New York federal prosecutors -- which could last throughout his presidency -- may ultimately pose more danger to him, his family and his allies than the inquiry by special counsel Robert Mueller, according to people close to Trump. Prosecutors' recent interest in executives at Trump's family company may intensify those fears. The specific inquiry or topics of interest by prosecutors in any interviews with Trump Organization executives wasn't immediately clear.\u201d -- A 1995 video surfaced showing Trump talking with Moscow officials about a possible building project in the city. The Independent\u2019s Chris Riotta reports: \u201cThe video, allegedly aired by Russian state television in 1995, shows the US president meeting with members of the former mayor\u2019s administration. \u2018Trump was in Moscow,\u2019 Yury Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow from 1992 through 2010, told the Interfax news agency. \u2018He had contacts\u2026on matters related to the construction of the Okhotny Ryad underground mall on Manezh Square.\u2019 \u2026 Mr Trump\u2019s reported meeting with Moscow officials in 1995 and the newly-unearthed footage does not show any clear wrongdoing on the part of the president. It does, however, refute the notion that he had zero dealings in Russia before assuming the White House in 2016 \u2014 a frequent claim made by Mr Trump and his inner circle.\u201d -- BuzzFeed News obtained a set of internal documents outlining how talks about a Trump Tower Moscow occurred as Trump praised Vladimir Putin on the campaign trail:\u00a0\u201cAs Trump went from rally to rally, vociferously denying any dealings in Russia, his representatives, Michael Cohen and his associate Felix Sater, worked with Trump Organization lawyers and even Ivanka Trump to push forward negotiations to build a 100-story edifice just miles from the Kremlin. The fixers believed they needed Putin\u2019s support to pull off the lucrative deal, and they planned to use Trump\u2019s public praise for him to help secure it. At the same time, they plotted to persuade Putin to openly declare his support for Trump\u2019s candidacy. \u2018If he says it we own this election,\u2019 Sater wrote to Cohen.\u201d -- Firms recruited by Paul Manafort are being investigated by federal prosecutors over foreign payments. The New York Times\u2019s Kenneth P. Vogel reports: \u201cThe previously unreported interviews about the flow of the money are among the latest developments in the investigation of key figures who worked at the three firms \u2014 Mercury Public Affairs, the Podesta Group and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Prosecutors have focused on the role of Skadden Arps\u2019s lead partner on the account, the former Obama White House counsel Gregory B. Craig, in arranging financing and media coverage for his firms\u2019 work, the people familiar with the questioning said. And the prosecutors, they said, have also been asking about the extent to which the lead partners on the accounts for Mercury and Podesta \u2014 Vin Weber, a former Republican member of Congress, and the Democratic fund-raiser Tony Podesta \u2014 were involved in orchestrating their firms\u2019 day-to-day lobbying and public relations on the account.\u201d -- A memo surfaced showing how the company owned by Tom Barrack, the president\u2019s inaugural chair, aimed to exploit his connections to the Trump administration. Justin Elliott and Ilya Marritz report for ProPublica: \u201cThe memo outlines a \u2018strategic plan\u2019 for Colony, which now has $44 billion under management, to ramp up its operations in Washington and open an office there. It envisions \u2018setting up roundtables between Ambassadors and members of the Administration to cultivate relationships\u2019 in areas including infrastructure and plans to \u2018tie into international bilateral meetings already occurring with key members of the Trump Administration.\u2019 \u2026 Barrack\u2019s company should do all this while keeping a low profile, seeking to build a \u2018subtle brand,\u2019 the memo says.\u201d -- House Democrats will ramp up their investigations into Trump\u2019s alleged Russia ties this week. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cThe House Intelligence Committee is expected to vote Wednesday to provide [Mueller] with all interview transcripts from its Republican-led probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \u2026 On Friday, [Michael Cohen], who already pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, is due to provide private testimony before the panel. \u2026 And the House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hear public testimony Friday from acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker as part of its probe of circumstances surrounding Mueller\u2019s investigation.\u201d -- Stormy Daniels dropped her defamation claim against Michael Cohen. Mark Berman reports: \u201cDistrict Judge S. James Otero, in a ruling issued Monday, allowed Daniels to amend her complaint to drop the allegation against Cohen. Otero wrote that he was dismissing the defamation claim \u2018with prejudice,\u2019 adding that this meant Daniels \u2018cannot simply re-litigate the defamation cause of action.\u2019\u201d -- The National Enquirer\u2019s reporting on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s affair has led some to speculate it was a political hit job, given the president\u2019s criticism of the Post owner and the tabloid\u2019s connections to the Trump campaign. Marc Fisher, Manuel Roig-Franzia and Sarah Ellison report: \u201cThe saga might have been easily dismissed as little more than tabloid fare, but it has taken on a more serious cast in recent days. A volley of charges and countercharges about how and why the Enquirer launched its investigation has emerged for several reasons, including the history of the Enquirer, which has acknowledged taking actions during the last presidential campaign that benefited Trump politically. Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly lodged attacks on The Post\u2019s coverage of him and on Bezos, who bought the news company in 2013. And Bezos, the head of a retail giant that is famously loath to comment to the media, has authorized his security chief to speak about his investigation. \u201cBezos\u2019s longtime private security consultant, Gavin de Becker, has concluded that the billionaire was not hacked. Rather, de Becker said in an interview, the Enquirer\u2019s scoop about Bezos\u2019s relationship with former TV anchor Lauren Sanchez began with a \u2018politically motivated\u2019 leak meant to embarrass the owner of The Post \u2014 an effort potentially involving several important figures in Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. As the Daily Beast first reported last week, de Becker has publicly named only one subject of his investigation, Michael Sanchez, Lauren\u2019s brother and a pro-Trump Hollywood talent manager who is also an acquaintance of provocative Trump backers Roger Stone and Carter Page.\u201d Republican lawmakers watch Trump deliver the State of the Union. (Jonathan Newton\/The Washington Post) THE IMMIGRATION WARS: -- Senate Republicans indicated they might agree to less border wall money than Trump wants but also signaled uncertainty about where Trump stands. Erica Werner and Robert Costa report: \u201cSen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of the bipartisan committee of House-Senate negotiators that is working on writing a border security bill, said both sides have moved off their initial positions. In the case of Republicans, that was the $5.7 billion Trump has been demanding for his wall \u2014 while Democrats\u2019 starting point in the negotiations was to offer no money for physical barriers on the border. Blunt said Tuesday that $5.7 billion \u2018is not a magic number, that\u2019s for sure.\u2019 Asked whether that was Trump\u2019s view as well, Blunt said: \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know about that. I think at the end of the day it would be, if we can write this the right way.\u2019\u201d -- New Mexico\u2019s governor ordered the state\u2019s National Guard to withdraw most of its troops from the southern border. Robert Moore reports: Gov. Michelle\u00a0Lujan Grisham, \u201ca Democrat who took office last month after serving six years in the U.S. House, made the announcement shortly before [Trump\u2019s] State of the Union address, in which he spoke of a \u2018tremendous onslaught\u2019 at the southern border. Lujan Grisham said she would keep some New Mexico Guardsmen in the southwest corner of the state, which has seen a huge influx of Central American families in recent months. But she said she rejected \u2018the federal contention that there exists an overwhelming national security crisis at the southern border, along which are some of the safest communities in the country.\u2019\u201d -- San Diego\u2019s Republican mayor announced an initiative to help welcome immigrants to the city. The AP\u2019s Julie Watson reports: \u201cEconomic growth is tied to immigrants, with one in four people in San Diego foreign-born, Mayor Kevin Faulconer said at a news conference, surrounded by civic and business leaders, including former Republican mayor Jerry Sanders, who heads the Chamber of Commerce. \u2018San Diego is proud to be a destination for immigrants in search of an opportunity,\u2019 Faulconer said, adding that immigrants from around the globe \u2018define who we are as a region.\u2019 The announcement came less than a week after San Diego County decided to provide a building to shelter asylum seekers after they are released from detention.\u201d -- A senior Customs and Border Protection official apologized after an agent at a passport control checkpoint grilled a BuzzFeed News reporter about the outlet\u2019s Michael Cohen story. BuzzFeed's Ellie Hall reports: \u201c\u2018On behalf of the agency, I would like to extend our apologies to Mr. David Mack for the inappropriate remarks made to him during his CBP processing upon his arrival to the United States,\u2019 CBP Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs Andrew Meehan said \u2026 Mack, BuzzFeed News' deputy breaking news director, landed at JFK Airport Sunday night after a brief trip to the United Kingdom to renew his US work visa. \u2026 Mack said that the [CBP] agent saw BuzzFeed listed as his employer on his visa and began to ask him questions about the outlet's reporting\u201d on\u00a0Mueller's investigation. Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke sits for an interview with Oprah Winfrey\u00a0on Tuesday in New York. (Kathy Willens\/AP) 2020 WATCH:  -- Beto O\u2019Rourke said during an interview with Oprah Winfrey that he was leaning toward a presidential bid and would make a final decision by the end of the month. Matt Viser reports: \u201cIn a theater in Times Square \u2014 and sandwiched in a program that started with actor Michael B. Jordan and ended with actor-director Bradley Cooper \u2014 the former Texas congressman outlined the case for a Democratic candidate who could knit together a divided country and dropped hint after hint that he believes that candidate should be him. \u2018I have been thinking about running for president,\u2019 he said, to a large round of applause. \u2026 \u2018I\u2019ve got to tell you. You can tell. I\u2019m so excited at the prospect of being able to play that role.\u2019\u201d -- Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) will make an announcement Sunday about her 2020 plans in Minnesota.

Klobuchar is taking other steps that look like setup for a presidential campaign: She is scheduled to travel to Iowa later this month, where she will headline the Ankeny Area Democrats Winter Banquet, and her team is exploring events elsewhere in the first caucus state that are likely to be added to that itinerary.\u201d -- Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) acknowledged in an interview that he has a girlfriend, but he is not naming her.\u00a0Helena Andrews-Dyer reports: \u201c\u2018I got a boo,\u2019 Booker declared on the national radio show \u2018The Breakfast Club\u2019 in a wide-ranging interview.\u00a0\u2026 Booker, 49, who has often remained somewhat tight-lipped about his love life, never mentioned his new girlfriend by name but did make clear that the two are an established item.\u201d -- Rep.

Finally a candidate who will actually put America First rather than Israel First!\u201d (The Hill) -- Howard Schultz will deliver what aides are billing as a major policy speech tomorrow to outline his vision for an independent presidential campaign. Michael Scherer reports: \u201cSchultz has yet to commit to a presidential campaign, and he has dismissed claims that he would be a spoiler, saying he will not do anything to help reelect Trump. In the meantime, his advisers have also argued that the controversy and media coverage over his potential run will ultimately help him deliver his message to the American people.\u201d -- Schultz\u2019s investment in a for-profit college could become a political liability for him if he runs for president. Politico\u2019s Christopher Cadelago reports: Schultz\u00a0\u201cinvested millions of dollars and personally owned stock in Capella University, a troubled for-profit college that overcharged the federal student loan program hundreds of thousands of dollars, records show. \u2026 The Office of the Inspector General in a 2008 audit found it overcharged the student aid program by $588,000 for the school years between 2002 and 2005 \u2014 and recommended that Federal Student Aid officials require the university to return the improperly retained funds.\u201d -- Former Massachusetts governor\u00a0William Weld changed his party registration back to Republican as he considers a primary challenge against Trump. The AP reports: \u201cWeld served as a Republican governor from 1991 until 1997. He later became a Libertarian and ran for vice president on a ticket with former New Mexico Gov.

He added that Kansas has a late filing deadline and that \u2018there\u2019s no urgency for him to make that decision.\u2019 \u2026 But Trump recently dismissed the notion that Pompeo would leave his post to run for Senate. \u2018I asked him the question the other day. He says he\u2019s absolutely not leaving,\u2019 Trump said in an interview on CBS\u2019s \u2018Face the Nation\u2019 that aired Sunday.\u201d THE LATEST FROM RICHMOND: -- Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, who built his political career on his honesty and authenticity, was shocked by the immediate calls from Democratic allies for his resignation after a racist photo was discovered on his medical school yearbook page. Gregory S. Schneider and Laura Vozzella have a behind-the-scenes look at the chaos engulfing Richmond: \u201cMost of his staff was gone for the night as [Northam] and his wife, Pam, worked the phones in the Executive Mansion. They called friends back in Norfolk, old classmates from his medical school, looking for answers about the racist photo that had emerged from his 1984 yearbook. When advisers showed up the next morning to what they thought would be the task of helping Northam resign, the near-sleepless governor had a surprise. \u201cThis isn\u2019t me,\u201d he told them Saturday, according to one adviser. \u2026 That set what was already a crisis into uncharted waters, as Northam staged a national news conference and defied calls to step down from virtually the entire political establishment. \u2026 \u201cBut his assumption that allies would give him the benefit of the doubt contributed to Northam\u2019s poor handling of the crisis over the photo, according to people close to the governor. And his shock at being so quickly discarded by the party has made it harder for Northam to accept the calls to resign, the people said. Over the past several days, he has even toyed with the idea of leaving the Democratic Party and governing as an independent \u2014 a sign of the degree that he is isolated from every political ally, from his state party and from the national party.\u201d -- Northam has started signaling to his few remaining allies that he thinks he can remain in office, according to the New York Times\u2019s Alan Blinder, Jonathan Martin and Trip Gabriel. \u201cThe governor, whose power has been on the verge of collapse since the photograph surfaced on Friday, intends to hire a private investigator to examine the circumstances of the picture, according to a Democrat familiar with his plans. \u2026 And Mr. Northam\u2019s supporters have begun to express increased confidence that he will hold on to his job, despite a national onslaught of condemnation, in part because the Republicans who control the General Assembly have demonstrated little urgency toward seeking his ouster.\u201d -- Democratic leaders are struggling with how to respond to a sexual assault allegation against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who would become governor if Northam resigns. From Jenna Portnoy, Laura Vozzella and Antonio Olivo: \u201cAlthough Democrats at the state and national level have been quick to say women should be believed and that all allegations should be investigated, they say they are resisting a rush to judgment. Unlike claims of assault against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, former senator Al Franken (D-Minn.), former congressman John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and others, Virginia Democrats privately note the accuser in the Fairfax case has not yet offered evidence she says corroborates her claim. The dilemma shows the trouble they have enforcing a policy of zero tolerance.\u201d -- If both Northam and Fairfax resign, Attorney General Mark Herring (D) would become governor, Larry J. Sabato and Kyle Kondik of U-Va.\u2019s Center for Politics note. \u201cIn the immediate aftermath of the Northam bombshell and Fairfax\u2019s seemingly likely ascension to the governorship, we thought back to Herring\u2019s decision to defer to Northam in advance of the 2017 election \u2026 With Fairfax potentially becoming governor, Herring \u2014 who previously announced his intention to seek the governorship in 2021 \u2014 could have been effectively blocked. Yet as of now, Herring is only one of the three elected Democratic statewide officeholders without a cloud over his head.\u201d Sabato and Kondik add that Northam\u2019s continued presence in the governor\u2019s mansion could have a detrimental effect on Democrats\u2019 efforts to retake control of Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates or Senate next year: \u201cRepublicans are hanging on to very slim majorities in the state House of Delegates (51-49) and state Senate (21-19). \u2026 Democrats seemed like favorites to win both chambers \u2026 particularly because a new state House of Delegates map imposed by judicial order will improve Democratic odds in that chamber. \u2026 But one could imagine the opposite happening, particularly if Northam hangs around and depresses Democrats, or the Fairfax allegations continue to churn.\u201d Gen. Joseph Votel, the commander of U.S. Central Command, testifies yesterday before the Senate Armed Services Committee. (Andrew Harnik\/AP) THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- The Senate passed its Middle East policy bill that includes a rebuke of Trump\u2019s plans to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cThe measure combines several legislative efforts that have been percolating through Congress in recent years, including an increase in sanctions against anyone who supports the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an extension of support to Jordanian security forces helping to combat the Islamic State and other threats to regional stability, and an authorization of security assistance to Israel. It also includes a politically controversial measure to bolster state and local laws to limit the reach of a global anti-Israel boycott campaign protesting the occupation of Palestinian territories \u2014 a provision that could spark challenges in the House, where some of the party\u2019s newest members are opposed to efforts seeking to limit criticism of Israel.\u201d -- The top U.S. general in the Middle East told a Senate panel he \u201cwas not consulted\u201d about Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria. The Daily Beast\u2019s Spencer Ackerman reports: Gen. Joseph Votel\u00a0\u201cwill next month step down from U.S. Central Command, where he has been in charge of the war against the Islamic State since 2016. He told [the Senate Armed Services Committee] that withdrawal will occur in a \u2018deliberate and coordinated manner,\u2019 with its details still under development. Votel also agreed with Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) that withdrawal from Syria will reduce some of the military pressure on ISIS, which he described as a \u2018resilient network.\u2019\u201d -- Saudi Arabia has transferred weapons sold to it by the United States to al-Qaeda-linked fighters and Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen. CNN\u2019s Nima Elbagir, Salma Abdelaziz, Mohamed Abo El Gheit and Laura Smith-Spark report: \u201cSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, its main partner in the war, have used the US-manufactured weapons as a form of currency to buy the loyalties of militias or tribes, bolster chosen armed actors, and influence the complex political landscape, according to local commanders on the ground and analysts \u2026 By handing off this military equipment to third parties, the Saudi-led coalition is breaking the terms of its arms sales with the US, according to the Department of Defense. After CNN presented its findings, a US defense official confirmed there was an ongoing investigation into the issue.\u201d -- John Cantlie, a British journalist abducted by the Islamic State six years ago, is believed to still be alive. The New York Times\u2019s Rukmini Callimachi, David D. Kirkpatrick and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a report: \u201cMr. Cantlie has been seen in several propaganda videos made by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, but the last one was released more than two years ago. On Tuesday, Ben Wallace, Britain\u2019s minister for security, told journalists at a Home Office briefing that Mr. Cantlie was thought to be alive, though he did not disclose how the government might have knowledge of his condition.\u201d Trump speaks during a meeting to discuss fighting human trafficking on the southern border.

Toluse Olorunnipa reports: \u201cInterviews with historians and a review of the schedules of recent former presidents released through their presidential libraries highlight the degree to which Trump\u2019s sparse official schedule appears to be an anomaly. \u2026 Most former presidents reported starting their mornings in the Oval Office, and adhering to a packed and highly regimented daily schedule that included briefings, ceremonial events, and meetings and phone calls with lawmakers and foreign leaders.\u201d -- Mick Mulvaney invited a bipartisan group of lawmakers to Camp David. Politico\u2019s John Bresnahan and Jake Sherman report: \u201cIt's the second time in recent weeks that Mulvaney has invited lawmakers to Camp David, although this is the first session that includes Democrats, according to administration officials. \u2026 Trump is not planning to attend the get-together.\u201d -- A new report found that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019s home state of Michigan ranks last in total education revenue growth between 1995 and 2015. Valerie Strauss reports: \u201cThe Michigan State University study, titled \u2018Michigan School Finance at the Crossroads: A Quarter Century of State Control,\u2019 offers a comprehensive look at school funding in the state since the 1994 passage of a law known as Proposal A, which largely shifted funding from local school districts to the state. According to the report, total K-12 education funding declined by 30 percent between 2002 and 2015, with 74 percent of that drop caused by declining state support for schools.\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: A senior adviser to Trump's reelection bid sparked outrage by suggesting female Democratic lawmakers' choice to wear white at the State of the Union was connected to the KKK: The color was actually a tribute to suffragists: The outspoken pro-Trump president of Liberty University, Jerry Falwell's son, made this sweeping statement about the speech: The freshman House Democrat who replaced Beto O'Rourke accused Trump of lying about her Texas district: The mayor of San Juan expressed frustration with the lack of reference to Puerto Rico: The moderator of \u201cMeet the Press\u201d highlighted something Trump neglected to mention in his speech: A New York Times reporter shared an image of lawmakers' reactions to Trump's comment on late-term abortions: The Onion poked fun at Democrats' choice of speaker to deliver the response: This 2016 tweet from Tulsi Gabbard recirculated after David Duke endorsed her 2020 bid: Al Franken appeared at a D.C. book event: The president's daughter and adviser reacted to an art exhibit featuring her likeness: A bipartisan pair of senators went to a spin class together: And spring training is just around the corner: GOOD READS: -- Bloomberg News, \u201cInside Wisconsin\u2019s Disastrous $4.5 Billion Deal With Foxconn,\u201d by Austin Carr: \u201cInterviews with 49 people familiar with Foxconn\u2019s Wisconsin project, including more than a dozen current and former employees close to its efforts there, show how hollow the boosters\u2019 assurances have been all along. While Foxconn for months declined requests to interview executives, insiders describe a chaotic environment with ever-changing goals far different from what Trump and others promised. \u2026 The only consistency, many of these people say, lay in how obvious it was that Wisconsin struck a weak deal.\u201d -- \u201cPope Francis just made history by visiting the Arabian Peninsula. But was he a pawn?\u201d by Dalia Hatuqa: \u201cReligious history was made this week on the Arabian Peninsula, with Pope Francis becoming the first pontiff to visit the region. \u2026 Yet to many Muslims like me, the famously humble and open pope may have allowed himself to be a pawn as his Gulf interlocutors use him to bolster their facade as a tolerant, liberal society while suppressing diversity and freedom and waging war in Yemen.\u201d HOT ON THE LEFT: \u201cTrump\u2019s travel to Mar-a-Lago alone probably cost taxpayers more than $64 million,\u201d from Philip Bump: \u201cOn Tuesday, [the Government Accountability Office] released a report looking only at Trump\u2019s first four trips to Mar-a-Lago as president: on Feb. 3-6; Feb. 10-12; Feb. 17-20; and March 3-5, 2017. The total? Just under $14 million, for an average cost of $3.4 million per trip. That includes about $8.5 million spent by the Defense Department and $5 million by the Department of Homeland Security. It also includes about $60,000 paid directly to Mar-a-Lago itself, $24,000 of which was for lodging for Defense Department personnel and $36,000 for operational space used by DHS. \u2026 If we, therefore, assume a blanket average of $3.4 million per trip, regardless of duration, the total the government has spent on Trump\u2019s trips to the resort tops $64 million.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT: A group of Trump\u2019s allies traveled to the southern border to explore the idea of privately funding a border wall.

Lang reports: \u201cWhen the District approved a budget last year allocating $1.5 million to buy the parcel of land from Metro and establish an official dog park, many thought their work was done. Then the \u2018for sale\u2019 sign went up. As the city now prepares to offer $2.1 million to acquire \u2014 and \u2018save\u2019 \u2014 the park, critics have questioned the wisdom of funneling millions into a neighborhood dog run, rather than using the money to address citywide issues, such as affordable housing.\u201d VIDEOS OF THE DAY: Late-night hosts made jokes\u00a0about Trump's State of the Union: Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) gave a speech\u00a0posted to her Facebook page before Trump's address: Ralph Northam's medical school reacted to the racist picture included on his 1984 yearbook page: And a dinosaur with spines along its back was discovered in Patagonia:","196":"With little public fanfare, U.S.\u00a0Cyber Command, the military\u2019s new center for combating electronic attacks against the United States, has launched operations to deter and disrupt Russians who have been interfering with the U.S. political system. Like other U.S. cyberwar activities, the disruption effort against Russia is cloaked in secrecy. But it appears to involve, in part, a warning to suspected Russian hackers that echoes a menacing phrase that\u2019s a staple of many fictional crime and spy thrillers: \u201cWe know where you live.\u201d Beginning last fall, before the midterm elections, Cyber Command began directly contacting Russians who were linked to operations, such the Internet Research Agency, that allegedly helped coordinate Moscow\u2019s campaign to subvert the 2016 presidential election. The apparent aim was to put people on notice that their covers had been blown, and that their ability to work and travel freely might be affected. U.S. officials believe the disruption effort has frazzled some of the Russian targets and may have deterred some interference during the midterms. The operation was first reported by the New York Times on Oct. 23, and additional details have emerged from public and private sources. One unlikely public confirmation of the warning campaign came from Yevgeny Zubarev, the director of the St.\u00a0Petersburg-based Federal News Agency . Justice Department prosecutors have alleged that Zubarev\u2019s information website, known by the acronym FAN, was part of the same covert-action network as the Internet Research Agency. \u201cThe United States Cyber Command writes to me to say that what I am doing is wrong, that their job is to fight trolls,\u201d Zubarev told the Daily Beast in December. \u201cWe are defending the motherland on the information fronts.\u201d But he denied he was involved with any alleged \u201ctroll farm.\u201d A catalogue of potential Russian operatives, who might be targets of similar Cyber Command warnings, came in an indictment unsealed in October describing a Russian bookkeeper\u2019s role in managing a \u201cconspiracy .\u2009.\u2009. to sow division and discord in the U.S. political system.\u201d A dozen fronts for this alleged political-interference operation, including FAN, are cited in the indictment, along with 14\u00a0companies that maintained bank accounts to finance operations. Prosecutors alleged that the bookkeeper prepared \u201chundreds of financial vouchers, budgets, and payment requests,\u201d and the indictment listed precise figures from a series of monthly budgets from February 2017 to July 2018. This was the covert world\u2019s version of a \u201cgotcha.\u201d The implication was that U.S.\u00a0intelligence had the names, dates, Web addresses and other details of anyone touched by the bookkeeper\u2019s electronic connections. Some of these operatives and contractors may have been among those pinged by Cyber Command. The message, in part, was that their ability to operate in secret had vanished. This tactic of outing Russian cyberoperatives may have a \u201cdeterrent effect,\u201d argues Thomas Rid, a Johns Hopkins University professor and author of the forthcoming book \u201cActive Measures: A History of Disinformation.\u201d He explained during an interview:  \u201cWe know from history that when intelligence officers who have prized secrecy their entire careers are exposed, it is a punch in the gut.\u201d Cyber Command\u2019s doctrine in more aggressively targeting Russian manipulation was outlined by Gen. Paul Nakasone, the unit\u2019s commander, in the current issue of Joint Force Quarterly.  He said that past efforts to combat adversaries who penetrated U.S. networks or Internet sites \u201chave not worked,\u201d and that the United States instead needed to take the offensive and \u201cpersistently engage\u201d these adversaries through what he called \u201cdefending forward.\u201d Describing the activities of the Russia Small Group, a joint intelligence community effort to combat Russian interference in the 2018 midterm elections, Nakasone explained: \u201cWe are in constant contact with our adversaries in cyberspace. .\u2009.\u2009. How do we warn, how do we influence our adversaries, how do we position ourselves in case we have to achieve outcomes in the future?\u201d The direct messaging to Russian operatives was part of that warning effort. In combating Russian information operations last year, Cyber Command and the National Security Agency are said to have furnished information they had obtained about Russian trolling and passed it to the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, which then warned social media platforms and other organizations to counter the threats. Facebook, Twitter and other companies have recently announced steps to curtail foreign manipulation through fake accounts, but they\u2019ve said little about how they obtained their evidence. Nakasone\u2019s new doctrine moves the United States closer to Russia\u2019s approach of treating cyberspace as part of a continuum of warfare. Rather than a binary on\/off switch, conflict is now seen as something closer to a rheostat, which can be dialed up or down as conditions require. In the cyberwar ladder of escalation, operations range from \u201cshaping the battlespace\u201d in preparation for conflict (zero), to deterring (one), seizing the initiative (two), dominating the adversary (three) and transitioning back to normal activities (four). In combating Russian election interference, Cyber Command evidently restricted its operations to phases one and two. Nakasone has likened his \u201cdefend forward\u201d approach to the way Navy ships operate at sea, rather than staying in port, or the way Air Force planes patrol the skies, instead of remaining at airfields. Nakasone warned that, rather than hoping to deter cyber adversaries through the threat of retaliation, \u201cwe will operate continuously to present our decision-makers with up-to-date options.\u201d One cyber expert bluntly explained the strategy this way: \u201cWe\u2019d rather kill the archer than dodge arrows.\u201d We\u2019ve repeated so often that a new age of warfare is dawning, with cyber and other forms of high-tech conflict, that it\u2019s easy to miss the importance of this inflection point. A foreign adversary conspired to undermine the American political system. The United States has responded, after initial uncertainty, by taking its cyberdefense into the heart of the adversary\u2019s networks of covert manipulation. Now that the battle has been joined, the world will be living in a contested information space, indefinitely.

Now that we've got a\u00a0(potentially brief) respite from the partial\u00a0government shutdown:\u00a0tips, recipes, comments? Reach out and sign up. Thanks for waking up with us.\u00a0 HOW TO LOSE FRIENDS AND ALIENATE PEOPLE (IN 18 DAYS): Have another government shutdown. Which is something President Trump hasn't ruled out. Yet again. But there are other options: 1. A deal is hashed out: A gang of 17 Republicans and Democrats from the House and Senate\u00a0Appropriations panels\u00a0has been charged with the uphill\u00a0task of negotiating an agreement to prevent another shutdown by Feb. 15. Despite the formal \u201creset\u201d button hit Friday to resume talking under less dysfunctional conditions, Democrats and Republicans seemed to retreat to their previous positions.\u00a0Trump himself\u00a0told the Wall Street Journal's Peter Nicholas and Kristina Peterson\u00a0he thought the committee's chances of successfully negotiating an agreement were\u00a0\u201cless than 50-50.\u201d\u00a0 2. Trump declares a national emergency:\u00a0\u201cThe president\u2019s commitment is to defend the nation, and he will do it either with or without Congress,\u201d Trump's Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d The Post's Bob Costa and Felicia Sonmez report that Trump told advisers over the weekend that declaring a national emergency \u201cmay be his best option as he scrambles to assert himself in a divided government and secure wall funding, according to four people involved in the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.\u201d 3. Fund the government without\u00a0the wall: This seems pretty\u00a0unlikely given how central Trump's wall is to his\u00a0identity \u2014 and capitulating\u00a0on his most prominent campaign promise would not bode well for burgeoning 2020 reelection efforts.\u00a0But we suppose it's\u00a0always possible\u00a0Trump could\u00a0go silently\u00a0into the night, to the choir of gloating Democrats,\u00a0as he did this past\u00a0Friday by finally agreeing to reopen the government. After following him down the last shutdown rabbit hole, congressional Republicans, fearing more backlash, are unlikely to do the same again. However, take a glance at Trump's latest tweets and it looks like another cave is unlikely.\u00a0And it's\u00a0sentiments like the below from\u00a0Ken Blackwell of the Family Research Council that are preventing\u00a0Trump from giving up:\u00a0 \u201cI think that if he gets movement and he gets a reasonable construction schedule on a good portion of the 230 miles, that his base will be right back and be totally engaged,\u201d Blackwell told Seung Min and Sean.\u00a0He added: \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t get any movement and he doesn\u2019t pull the trigger [on an emergency declaration], then the base will be frustrated. You will start to see some serious deterioration of support.\u201d\u00a0 4. We head into another shutdown: After a painful 35 days that left 800,000 federal employees without paychecks, most lawmakers agreed that legislation needs to be passed ASAP to outlaw\u00a0shutdowns, stopping them\u00a0from being used as a negotiating tactic. Both Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Portman (R-Ohio) have introduced anti-shutdown legislation.\u00a0 \u201cShutting down the government should be as off limits in budget negotiations as chemical warfare is in real warfare,\u201d Sen.\u00a0Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) told the New York Times's Carl Hulse.\u00a0 A Wall Street Journal \/ NBC News poll released yesterday that was\u00a0conducted at the tail end of the government shutdown:\u00a0 PRESS PLAY:\u00a0Democrats finally have their chance to introduce and debate\u00a0some of their legislative priorities\u00a0now that the government has\u00a0reopened. The New York Times's Nick Fandos has a super helpful\u00a0rundown of their priorities:\u00a0 Wage gap bill: \u201cLeading Democrats also plan to reintroduce a marquee bill to close the pay gap between men and women that they have fought to enact for years.\u201d BDS movement bill: \u201cIn the Senate, Republicans will try to push through a bipartisan Middle East policy bill that includes a disputed provision targeting the movement to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel. With the measure, Republicans will test for fractures in the resurgent Democratic Party, where Palestinian rights activists have found new voices in House freshmen such as Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.\u201d SOTU: \u201cMs. Pelosi and Mr. Trump also are likely to renew discussion in the coming days about a date to reschedule the president\u2019s State of the Union address, which was previously scheduled for Tuesday and became a casualty of the shutdown.\u201d\u00a0 Prescription drugs:\u00a0\u201cAnd Sen\u00a0Charles E.

Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra announced Tuesday that the government purchased 12.68 percent of shares in Air France-KLM S.A. The Dutch state already owns a 5.9-percent stake in KLM, the national airline of the Netherlands. Hoekstra said the holding company shares will allow the government to exert greater sway in strategic decisions about the alliance. The announcement comes a week after Air France and KLM reached a compromise on tightening ties between the two airlines after fears of a power struggle alarmed the Dutch government, airline employees and shareholders. Hoekstra said the government spent 680 million euros ($775 million) and plans to build up its stake to around 14 percent, almost equal to the French government\u2019s stake of 14.3 percent. \u201cThis shows our commitment to KLM and to the entire group,\u201d Hoekstra said. \u201cWe are convinced that this company can and must perform better in Europe. But that needs to go hand-in-hand with protecting Dutch and French interests.\u201d KLM\u2019s success is closely intertwined with that of Schiphol Airport on the edge of Amsterdam; together, they generate tens of thousands of jobs and billions of euros in revenue. The airline has had layoff and cost cuts but is more profitable than Air France, which has faced extended labor disputes in recent years. Air France-KLM CEO Benjamin Smith met Dutch government ministers in The Hague earlier this month to discuss the airlines\u2019 future. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte declined at the time to give details from the discussion, but he stressed what was at stake. \u201cIt is unbelievably important for the Dutch economy that KLM functions well,\u201d he said.","199":"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s government on Tuesday proposed increases in spending on public servants and incentives to boost agriculture and fisheries in a new national budget, which opposition lawmakers criticized as an attempt to attract voters ahead of a presidential election this year. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the basic salaries of public sector employees will increase by 107 percent from 2016 to 2020, and the government has allocated 40 billion rupees ($222 million) in the budget to pay the increased amount. They will also receive an allowance of 2,500 rupees ($14) starting July 1. The 3.15 trillion rupee ($17.5 billion) budget covers only eight months because of a political crisis that erupted last October, forcing the adoption of a four-month stopgap funding measure to avert a government shutdown. Presenting the budget in Parliament, Samaraweera also announced a decision to increase allowances for the military and police, concessionary loans targeting young people to build an entrepreneurial society, and incentives, loans and state assistance for agriculture and fisheries. Funds were also allocated for poverty alleviation and to build reservoirs and canals. To help pay for the increased expenditures, Samaraweera announced higher taxes on cigarettes, liquor and vehicles and increased casino fees. Opposition lawmaker Chandima Weerakkody said the budget is designed to win votes in the election. \u201cThey have presented this budget targeting the presidential election which is to be held within the next few months. They are trying to deceive the public for their political gains. The government will not be able to implement these proposals because they don\u2019t have money,\u201d he said. Parliamentary elections are to be held next year. The budget proposals come as Sri Lanka struggles to repay $5.9 billion in foreign loans this year, of which 40 percent needs to be serviced during the first three months. The country used its reserves to repay a $1 billion sovereign bond loan in January.\u00a0 Sri Lanka\u2019s annual budget is usually presented in November, but was delayed by the political crisis. The upheaval occurred after President Maithripala Sirisena abruptly fired Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and replaced him with former strongman President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Sirisena later dissolved Parliament and called for new elections. However, Rajapaksa could not achieve a majority in Parliament and Wickremesinghe maintained his sacking was illegal, saying he still controlled a majority in the 225-member house. A subsequent Supreme Court ruling declared that Sirisena\u2019s dissolution of Parliament was illegal. Sirisena was forced to reappoint Wickremesinghe as prime minister. In December, Samaraweera presented a stopgap measure of 1.77 trillion rupees ($9.39 billion) to cover government expenditures over the first four months of 2019, which Parliament approved, averting a possible government shutdown on Jan. 1. Last week, the IMF said it has agreed to extend a $1.5 billion loan program for Sri Lanka for an additional year. It had been due to release an instalment in October when the political crisis hit and the program was temporary suspended.","200":"It\u2019s a national humiliation,\u00a0pretty much everyone agrees.

On Thursday, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) wrote to Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) to complain about what he termed \u201cextremely unfair and unsupported accusations\u201d included in a letter Cummings sent to the White House Counsel\u2019s Office late Friday. In that letter, Cummings said that lawyers for President Trump \u201cmay have provided false information\u201d to federal ethics officials about the president\u2019s reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former personal attorney, for payments Cohen had made to an adult film actress. The Republicans complained Thursday that Cummings had misinterpreted documents he obtained from the Office of Government Ethics and, as a result, unfairly accused the lawyers of misrepresenting facts about the Cohen payments. Cohen, who pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance violations and lying to Congress, has admitted he paid $130,000 to actress Stormy Daniels in October 2016. Daniels said she had a sexual encounter with Trump years earlier, and Cohen has said the payment was to buy her silence. After making the payment, Cohen has said he asked Trump\u2019s company for reimbursement. Cohen said in court that he had made the payments \u201cin coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office.\u201d Trump initially said he did not know about the payments. Later, however, his attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani revealed that Trump had in fact reimbursed Cohen. In a footnote on his personal financial disclosure filed in May, Trump reported a reimbursement to Cohen. His lawyers said he was disclosing it \u201cin the interest of transparency\u201d and stressed it was not required to be reported as debt. \u201cThese Republican letters seem to be attacking the very concept of congressional oversight,\u201d said Aryele Bradford, spokeswoman for the majority on the House Oversight Committee. \u201cCongress\u2019s job under the constitution is to seek and defend the truth, and be an independent check on the executive branch \u2014 not to act as the president\u2019s defense counsel.\u201d An OGE official declined to comment. The Jordan letter did not address the president\u2019s changing stories about the payments. Instead, it attacked Cummings\u2019s conclusions about the role of the lawyers representing the president \u2014 specifically, Stefan Passantino, a former deputy in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office who now works as an outside lawyer for the Trump Organization. Citing their own research, the Republican Congress members wrote that Passantino was simply seeking clarification of OGE disclosure regulations during a conversation with OGE experts, and not offering an explanation about the payments. The GOP letter said that \u201cit is simply irresponsible to conclude that Passantino made false statements to OGE\u201d and that Cummings had \u201cbesmirched the reputation\u201d of Passantino and a private-sector lawyer representing Trump, Sheri Dillon. The Republicans said that Cummings \u201crelied only on cherrypicked passages of incomplete, one-sided handwritten notes.\u201d In his letter, Cummings cited documents from OGE stating that Trump attorneys offered \u201cevolving stories\u201d on the payments to Cohen. The Republicans also wrote to the director of OGE questioning their response to Cummings\u2019s request for information on this matter. They wrote that the nature of the response could have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on government lawyers seeking answers from OGE in the future. The complaint is the second in two days lodged by the Republicans on the committee. On Thursday, they noted that Cummings had not included them in drafting or researching an explosive report examining the proposed sale of nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia, a controversial topic within the administration and on Capitol Hill. The letter sent Thursday by Jordan and the second-ranking Republican on the committee, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), reminded Cummings that he had promised greater comity. Cummings\u2019s behavior in this case \u201cis not the fair oversight process you promised for the committee,\u201d they wrote.","202":"MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Cardinal George Pell\u2019s trial on child abuse charges is probably the highest profile criminal case ever shrouded in secrecy by an Australian suppression order. The ban on media reporting of his trial in any format accessible from Australia accentuated the free-speech arguments against such court orders that are commonplace in every Australian state and in Britain. The order also highlighted the difficulty in enforcing such an order in the digital world and in an historic case against Pope Francis\u2019 finance minister that carries global ramifications. The point of suppressing news of the August-September trial, which ended in a deadlocked jury, and his retrial in November and December was to keep 12 Melbourne jurors in Pell\u2019s next trial in the dark. Prosecutors and defense lawyers agreed that knowledge Pell had previously been accused of child sex offenses could color the jurors\u2019 judgment when they heard another child abuse case against him in a second trial in April. But prosecutor Fran Dalziel told the Victoria state County Court on Tuesday that charges alleging Pell indecently assaulted two boys aged 9 or 10 and 11 or 12 as a young priest in the late 1970s in a public pool in his hometown of Ballarat had been dropped. His lawyer Robert Richter initially wanted an opportunity to ask an appeal court to issue its own suppression order in case Pell\u2019s convictions were overturned and he faced a retrial. An appeal of his convictions was filed last week. Dalziel objected, saying Pell \u201cwas not a special case.\u201d Richter eventually withdrew his application to prevent the suppression order being lifted. Breaching a suppression order could result in a prison sentence for the guilty reporter and a fine for a media company that has assets in Australia that put it within reach of the law. Journalists and media organizations beyond Australian shores are unaffected, even if the reporting is visible on the internet from Australia. The U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment would prevent such censorship in the United States. But many lawyers argue that suppression orders are preferable to an alternative exercised in many countries, closed courts. Concerns are mounting in Australia that the courts have got the balance wrong between ensuring fair trials and the public\u2019s right to know. That balance could also be shifting away from open courts because a fragmented media industry is losing the resources and the commercial incentive to fight for greater access to the courts. The Australian journalists\u2019 union \u2014 Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance \u2014 argues that Victoria and South Australia were two states that stood out for their propensity to make suppression orders to prevent media reporting some or all aspects of courts cases. Comparisons are difficult to make since Victoria is the only state that keeps records of how many orders are made. The Alliance is also concerned that the courts consider themselves the sole judges of what is in the public interest. The Alliance cites former Victorian judge Betty King who boasted in a speech in 2009 that she was \u201cprobably responsible for the majority of suppression orders imposed in Victoria in the last three years.\u201d King added that for every worthy media court report, there were others that were \u201cinaccurate, salacious, mischievous, morally indefensible and just plain prurient.\u201d But others outside the lopsided tug-of-war between judges and reporters recognize there is a problem with the principle of open justice in Victoria. Both Australia and Britain are bound by the 1913 ruling of the British House of Lords, once the highest court of appeal for both countries, that justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done. The right to a fair and public trial are included in the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as well as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights The Victorian parliament passed the Open Courts Act in 2013 that legislates \u201ca presumption in favor of disclosure of information to which a court or tribunal must have regard in determining whether to make a suppression order.\u201d Courts are also required to limit the scope of suppression orders and their durations to what is essential to achieve the order\u2019s purpose. Jason Bosland, the deputy director of the Center for Media and Communications Law at Melbourne University, found that the new laws failed to reduce the frequency of suppression orders that Victorian judges made over the two years since the Open Courts Act became law. Bosland also found that around 200 suppression orders were made a year from 2008 and 2013 for often unclear reasons and unlimited periods. \u201cIt\u2019s in the public interest that justice be done but it\u2019s also in the public interest that justice be seen to be done. So there\u2019s this tension between the workings of the courts and publicity,\u201d Bosland told The AP. \u201cWhen an application is made for a suppression order, the judge may be inclined to make it out of an abundance of caution,\u201d he added. The Victorian government is planning to change the laws in favor of open courts following a review of suppression orders by retired judge Frank Vincent. The government supports most of the review\u2019s recommendations, including allowing a five-day window for media to make submissions against any suppression order before that order became permanent. \u201cWe are taking action to ensure suppression orders are clear and only made when absolutely necessary,\u201d Attorney General Martin Pakula said. But the government is less enthusiastic about Vincent\u2019s recommendation for a state-appointed advocate to argue for the public\u2019s right to know in cases where suppression orders are sought. Such a champion for open justice would fill a role that media lawyers are less likely to play as fewer media companies assign dedicated court reporters. Australian suppression orders have proven wanting in a digital media environment, particularly in cases that attract international interest. Victorian judge Elizabeth Hollingworth in 2014 tried to protect Australia\u2019s national security and internationals relations by suppressing the names of Indonesian, Malaysian and Vietnamese officials and political leaders both past and present that were raised in a foreign bribery conspiracy trial involving two Australian central bank subsidiaries. But the suppression order was published by WikiLeaks, including the names of the 17 Southeast Asian political figures that were barred from publication. International news outlets subsequently republished the suppression order and disclosed its contents. Despite mainstream Australian media obeying the terms of the order, Hollingworth decided the order no longer served a purpose and lifted it. \u201cIn this case, it is the overseas publications that have the greatest potential to cause future harm to Australia\u2019s interests. The existing overseas publication is widespread and cannot be undone,\u201d she said. Australia Federal Police investigated the course of the leak but were unable to find someone to charge. Bosland said the internet was a game changer for suppression orders. While once broadcast news disappeared into the ether and newspaper editions quickly faded away after their publication dates, information remained widely accessible on the internet regardless of suppression orders. \u201cGiven the global nature of the internet, in certain cases it\u2019s becoming pretty apparent that if there\u2019s sufficient public interest worldwide, then suppression orders can potentially be ineffective,\u201d Bosland said.","203":"(Seth Perlman\/AP) THE PROGNOSIS Six miles lie\u00a0between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Coca-Cola\u2019s headquarters in downtown Atlanta. But more than just geographical proximity is fueling concerns that the soda giant is exerting undue influence over the federal agency that\u2019s supposed to protect the health of Americans. It\u2019s not the first time public health advocates have drawn attention to ties between Coca-Cola and public health agencies\u00a0(check out this and this). But the exchanges provide fresh evidence of the ways the food industry\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0in this case, the world\u2019s leading producer of sugar-sweetened beverages \u2014 seeks to direct public policy in its favor, often in ways that run contrary to science. Consumer groups have alleged that Coca-Cola tried to sway the CDC toward policies that would benefit its products by corresponding with top agency officials and donating to the CDC Foundation. The newly released emails are just the latest correspondence obtained by requests under the Freedom of Information Act. In one email, former Coca-Cola senior vice president Alex Malaspina wrote that WHO \u201cshould not only consider sugary foods as the only cause of obesity but to consider also the lifestyle changes that have been occurring throughout the universe.\u201d \"The emails we obtained using FOIA requests reveal efforts by Coca-Cola to lobby the CDC to advance corporate objectives rather than health, including to influence the World Health Organization,\" the report charges. There\u2019s a growing pile of evidence that a sugar-heavy diet contributes even more than previously thought to weight gain, and it\u2019s hard to combat the effects simply through exercise. Yet Coca-Cola, PepsiCo\u00a0and other beverage companies have sought \u2014 through influencing policymakers and lawmakers, misleading marketing campaigns and philanthropy \u2014 to shift the blame away from sugar consumption toward a lack of physical activity. \u201cOne of the things that the sugar industry has so far been quite successful in is denying the strong and emerging science related to the adverse effects of surgary drinks,\u201d said Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. That influence was apparent in former first lady Michelle Obama's\u00a0well-documented pivot from criticizing the food industry to encouraging kids to exercise more with her \"Let's Move\" campaign. Yet failing to tell the whole story about what really causes weight gain \u2014 and a host of related conditions including diabetes, heart attacks, strokes and cancer \u2014 carries huge ramifications. Obesity is estimated to generate $147 billion in medical costs in the United States every year. That number is expected to continue rising, as a generation of youth with unprecedented levels of obesity reach adulthood. Brenda Fitzgerald, then the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at the agency's headquarters in Atlanta in 2017. (Melissa Golden for The Washington Post) Some recent CDC officials have worked closely with Coca-Cola. The agency\u2019s former director Brenda Fitzgerald, who resigned a year ago over financial interests from which she\u00a0couldn\u2019t divest, worked on a childhood obesity program partially funded by the Coca-Cola Foundation while serving as commissioner of Georgia\u2019s public health department. That program emphasizes exercise while saying little about sugary soft drinks. And Barbara Bowman, director of the agency\u2019s Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention, resigned after the disclosure of emails in which she appeared eager and willing to help the beverage industry create sway with the WHO. \u201cThis looks like a local corruption story with global health implications,\u201d\u00a0Gary Ruskin, co-director of the public health group U.S. Right To Know and one of the report\u2019s authors, told me. \u201cThe CDC is supposed to fight disease, not be a helpmate for these companies.\u201d Ruskin's group filed a lawsuit against the CDC in early 2018, saying the agency failed to fully comply with a request for correspondence between agency officials and Coca-Cola under FOIA. Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Sheidler said the emails newly obtained by the group go back a number of years and pre-date a commitment the company\u00a0made in 2015 to disclose on its website its\u00a0funding for\u00a0scientific research and partnerships, which is updated every six months. He added that Coca-Cola is focused on reducing sugar in its drinks and promoting more beverage\u00a0options with less or no sugar, in support of WHO's recommendation that people limited added sugars to 10 percent of their daily caloric intake. \"We\u2019ve continued\u00a0our journey to be a more helpful and effective partner in efforts to address the serious problem of obesity around the world,\" Sheidler said. \"Over the past four years, we\u2019ve listened and learned from the public health community, our customers, associates and our consumers to understand the most appropriate role we can play to support the fight against obesity in a way that is credible, transparent, and beneficial for everyone .\" Here\u2019s another sign of how the soda industry has tried to influence policymakers: through contributing to the CDC Foundation, a nonprofit organization established by Congress in 1992 to promote public health. Coca-Cola donated more than $1 million to the foundation between 2010 and 2015, according to the company\u2019s website. The foundation\u2019s ethics guidelines prohibit it from accepting gifts that could compromise its integrity. But Ruskin and his colleagues write that studies reporting funding by the sugar-sweetened beverage industry \u201care more likely to find no association between the use of SSBs and obesity.\u201d The industry has been hugely successful in its efforts to duck the spotlight. While in the past Congress has conducted vigorous oversight of the tobacco industry, there have been virtually no hearings on how cheap products from the sugar and beverage industries are affecting the dismal U.S. showing when it comes to health-care spending and the day-to-day health of Americans. \u201cHow many real investigations into the power of big sugar and big soda happened during the Obama or Trump years? The answer: zero,\u201d Ruskin said. \u201cHow many major regulatory efforts were undertaken? Answer: zero. What more do you need than that?\u201d (iStock) AHH: Activists are urging Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to make sure bathrooms at K-12 schools have free menstrual hygiene products,\u00a0our\u00a0Post colleague Valerie Strauss reports In a full-page ad in The Washington Post on Monday, Period, the world\u2019s largest youth-run nonprofit looking to change\u00a0the conversation around menstruation, and grass-roots campaign United for Access called on DeVos to \u201cfulfill your agency\u2019s charge to remove discriminatory barriers that hold students back.\u201d \u201cEvery student deserves the reassurance that their school restrooms are outfitted with necessities to accommodate their biological needs,\u201d the ad reads. \u201cMenstrual hygiene products are basic necessities, and the inability to access them affects a student\u2019s freedom to study, be healthy, and participate in society with dignity.\u201d \u201cStudents and activists around the country have been pressing for years for school bathrooms to be supplied with menstrual products in what has become a national movement for \u2018menstrual equity,\u2019 \u201d Valerie writes. \u201cIts aim is to provide access to menstrual products to anyone who needs them, especially those from low-income families.\u201d Family and friends who have lost loved ones to OxyContin and opioid overdoses leave pill bottles in protest outside the headquarters of Purdue Pharma\u00a0in Stamford, Conn.\u00a0(Jessica Hil\/AP) OOF: A Massachusetts judge ruled a complaint by the state against\u00a0OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma for its role in the opioid crisis should be fully released to the public. Judge Janet Sanders ordered the complaint to be made public by noon on Friday, Stat's Andrew Joseph reports. Previously released documents related to the lawsuit provided\u00a0details about Purdue Pharma's marketing strategy but\u00a0had redacted segments.\u00a0 The judge's ruling came in response to a motion filed by Stat and the Boston Globe to release the full document. Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and WBUR joined the publications in seeking to release the complaint, Andrew writes. \u201cThe disclosure of the information \u2014 while it may prove embarrassing for some of the defendants \u2014 is not intensely personal or private,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cIn essence, the information describes the inner workings of a company and discussions about company business among its directors, officers, and employees.

Williams reports. \u201cYet population health analysts, academics and on-the-ground specialists say heroin and its related plagues of crime and death have stalked African-American neighborhoods for decades, garnering little to no attention,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe disparities in attention, resources and long-term strategies have led to a tale of two opioid crises. One is white, a malady of medical and mental health, and worthy of a White House-level task force. The other is black, criminal and largely ignored, even as statistics show black opioid users are dying at a skyrocketing pace.\u201d Treating addicted youth: America\u2019s youth have also been partly left out\u00a0of the conversation. \u201cThe same opioids abused by adults have taken their toll on younger generations: prescription painkillers, heroin and, increasingly, the synthetic substance fentanyl,\u201d reports Casey Leins. \u201cAdolescents suffering from opioid addiction can face a difficult road to recovery, as only a small percentage receive medication-assisted treatment \u2014 a mix of counseling, behavioral therapy and craving-reducing medications like buprenorphine or naltrexone that's widely accepted as an effective means of rehabilitation.\u201d Today Do third-party candidates impact elections?

A timeline of Pell\u2019s career and the criminal case: July 16, 1996: Auxiliary Bishop George Pell is appointed Archbishop of Melbourne. Within months he abuses two choir boys at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. March 26, 2001: Pell becomes Archbishop of Sydney. Oct. 21, 2003: Pope John Paul II makes Pell a cardinal.

April 8, 2014: One of the molested choirboys dies of a heroin overdose without alleging the crime and having told his mother he had not been abused. Aug. 5, 2014: Victoria state police establish Task Force Sano to investigate allegations that arose from a state parliamentary inquiry into handling of child abuse by religious and other nongovernment organizations. Sano also investigates allegations made to a similar national inquiry. June 18, 2015: The surviving choirboy gives his first statement to Sano detectives outlining criminal allegations against Pell. Dec. 12, 2015: Australian media report that Pell has canceled an appearance before an Australian government-commissioned inquiry into how the church and other institutions responded to child sexual abuse over decades. Pell said he could not fly back to Australia because of ill health. Dec. 23, 2015: Sano makes a public appeal for information relating to allegations of sexual offenses in Melbourne while Pell was archbishop from 1996 until 2001. March 1, 2016: Pell begins testifying by video link for four days from Rome to the Australian child abuse inquiry. Pell was critical of how the church had dealt with pedophile clerics in the past but denied he had been aware of the extent of the problem. Pell said he did not immediately act when a boy raised abuse allegations against a cleric in the 1970s and should have done more. July 27, 2016: Pell issues a statement denying sexual abuse allegations made on an Australian Broadcasting Corp. current affairs program. Oct. 19, 2016: Santo detectives go to Rome and question Pell. Pell hears for the first time details of the choirboy\u2019s allegations. June 29, 2017: Police charge Pell by summons with multiple counts of historical sexual assault offenses, making him the most senior cleric to be charged in the church\u2019s abuse crisis. Pell denied the accusations and took an immediate leave of absence as Vatican finance czar to return to Australia to defend himself. July 26, 2017: Pell makes his first appearance in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on charges that he sexually abused multiple children in his home state of Victoria decades earlier. Details of the allegations were not made public. Pell was not required to enter pleas but he vowed through his lawyers to fight the allegations. May 1, 2018: A magistrate commits Pell to stand trial after dismissing half the charges against him during a monthlong preliminary hearing. Pell pleads not guilty to all charges. May 2, 2018: A County Court judge rules Pell\u2019s charges will be separated into two trials. One would deal with charges relating to his time as archbishop in Melbourne in the 1990s and the other when he was a young priest in Ballarat in the 1970s. Aug. 15, 2018: Trial begins and runs for four weeks. Sept. 20, 2018: Jury discharged after failing to agree on a verdict following more than five days of deliberation. Nov. 7, 2018: Retrial begins. Dec. 6, 2018: Jury retires. Dec. 11, 2018: Jury unanimously convicts Pell on all charges. Feb. 26, 2019: Suppression order forbidding publication of any details about the trial is lifted. Prosecutors abandon second trial. Feb. 27, 2019: Sentencing hearing is held. March 13, 2019: Judge announces Pell is sentenced to 6 years in prison on five sex abuse convictions and must serve a minimum of 3 years and 8 months before he is eligible for parole.","205":"THE PROGNOSIS Momentum appears to be building on both sides of the aisle for Americans to receive\u00a0mandatory paid medical leave for new parents and maybe even for people to care for sick family members.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and several House Democrats yesterday reintroduced their FAMILY Act, which would provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and has become Democrats\u2019 template for how the government could guarantee the benefit not just for new parents but also for those who are ill or providing care to a family member. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see members on both sides of the aisle putting forward paid family leave proposals,\" Ivanka Trump said, a statement provided to The Health 202.\u00a0\"Twenty-five years after [the Family Medical Leave Act]\u00a0was passed we finally have bipartisan agreement on the importance of paid leave for working parents. Now we are seeking to build consensus around policy that can garner enough votes to be passed into law.\" Rubio and Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) plan to reintroduce their\u00a0alternative family leave proposal\u00a0within the next month, a measure that draws from existing Social Security benefits and is significantly less generous than what Democrats are proposing.\u00a0It offers six weeks of paid leave that would be extended only to new parents. And Trump, who called for paid family leave in his State of the Union address last year, again signaled in his address to Congress last week that he views the effort\u00a0as a top priority. \u201cI am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave, so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMy impression is the White House is increasingly engaged on this and making it a priority as they look forward to what is possible this year \u2014 assuming one thinks bipartisan legislation is possible in this climate,\u201d a senior GOP aide told me. \u201cIt\u2019s an increasing area of focus, so that\u2019s encouraging.\u201d Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).\u00a0(Brian Powers\/Des Moines Register\/AP) If there\u2019s any issue ripe for bipartisan work, it could be paid family leave. While the number of women in the workforce is at an all-time high, the United States\u00a0remains the only developed country with no mandatory paid leave offered by employers. Most Americans say employers should provide workers with paid family leave, although there are sharp divides when people are asked whether it should be a requirement. In a 2017 survey by the Pew Research Center, 51 percent of respondents said the federal government should mandate that employers provide paid leave, while 48 percent said it shouldn\u2019t. Likewise, there remains division between some Republican members of Congress who feel paid leave is an essential benefit for a workforce\u00a0increasingly led by women and others who argue it amounts to government overreach. The aide described it as an \u201cevolving process\u201d within the party. \u201cGenerally, the Republican Party is still grappling with how to deal with this issue,\u201d the aide said. \u201cThere are folks who know the party needs a position but are unsure of how to craft a policy, and there are still folks who don\u2019t think there is a federal nexus to be played.\u201d Rubio\u2019s measure, which he first introduced in August, would allow new parents to finance at least two months of paid leave by drawing from their Social Security benefits, which would result in a three- to six-month delay in receiving those benefits when they retire. While the measure wouldn\u2019t cost anything because it draws on existing benefits, it hasn\u2019t yet received any co-sponsors. Democrats have called the bill deeply inadequate, noting it would apply only to new parents and not others in need of medical-related leave. Yet Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said yesterday she\u2019s grateful Republicans are willing to at least discuss the issue. \u201cWe have our colleagues on the other sides of the aisle and the president who have come out with some form of paid leave,\u201d DeLauro said at the news conference reintroducing the Democrats\u2019 bill. \u201cThat\u2019s good and it\u2019s part of the national debate and this issue is at the center of our public discourse. \u2026 But I will just say to you their proposals fail to go far enough.\u201d Rubio said he \u201cwelcomes the discussion in Congress over paid family leave.\u201d He said in a statement:\u201cI am committed to seeing this effort through.\u201d Wagner shouted \u201cyes\u201d when Trump referred to paid family leave during his address to Congress. The reference also prompted applause from the crowd of House Democratic women clad in white, who sat in silence for much of the president\u2019s speech. The FAMILY Act has 160 co-sponsors in the House and 34 in the Senate \u2014 including every senator and representative seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. Some form of paid family leave is mandated in six states plus the District of Columbia, said Vicki Shabo, vice president at the National Partnership for Women and Families. California, which has the longest-standing leave requirements in the nation, may seek to expand its mandate to six months under a proposal expected from the state\u2019s new Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. Shabo, who testified at a Senate Finance subcommittee hearing last summer on the topic, said it was striking to her that every witness before the GOP-led panel agreed that adopting guaranteed paid leave was \u201can economic imperative.\u201d She said that wouldn\u2019t have been the case five years ago. \u201cWhat\u2019s been different and exciting over the last couple of years is seeing Republicans come on board with the issue,\u201d Shabo told me. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to be in a place and time where we\u2019re debating the \u2018what\u2019 and not the \u2018if.\u2019 \u201d CORRECTION: Ivanka Trump did not help Sen. Rubio craft his family leave bill, as the piece originally and inaccurately stated. She has been more generally involved in discussions with Republican senators interested in family leave legislation. AHH: The wave of new Democrats on Capitol Hill is using policy and social media to push the party to the left on divisive issues like health care and climate change ahead of the 2020 presidential election. \u201cBut the liberal shift, and the lawmakers driving it, are also creating challenges for Democrats in more-conservative areas, and they are giving President Trump and congressional Republicans fresh opportunities for political attacks,\u201d our Post colleagues Seung Min Kim, Annie Linskey and Rachael Bade report. Republicans are seizing the chance to portray Democrats as \u201cradical\u201d and out of touch with mainstream Americans, pointing to comments like Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019s (D-Calif.) support for ending private insurance in the pursuit of Medicare-for-all. Nearly all the Democratic senators who have declared they are running for president have backed Medicare-for-all legislation.\u00a0\u201cBut each Democrat has described the goal differently,\u201d our colleagues write. \u201cSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said in his weekend stops across Iowa that he backed a \u2018Medicare-for-all option,\u2019 describing a government program into which people could buy while leaving private insurance in place.\u201d Meanwhile, on the Hill, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)\u00a0has been forced \u201cto play damage control to keep progressive members \u2014 particularly freshmen \u2014 in line,\" they write. \"On the policy front, particularly on health care, Pelosi is focusing the caucus\u2019s attention on improving the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which was her chief legislative accomplishment during her first term as speaker.\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). (J. Scott Applewhite\/AP) OOF: In a call with donors last week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) directly blamed his party\u2019s midterm losses in the House on the issue of health care. He specifically called out the Republican effort to roll back protections for people with preexisting conditions, our Post colleague Mike DeBonis reports. In the Feb. 6 conference call, McCarthy pointed fingers at the House Freedom Caucus, also noting several of its members lost, and made comments that \u201cthreaten to rekindle internal resentments inside the House Republican Conference,\u201d Mike writes. The Post obtained partial records of the private call. The California Republican\u2019s remarks\u00a0\u201crepresent a vindication of Democratic efforts to elevate health care as an issue in last year\u2019s campaign,\u201d Mike adds. During the call, McCarthy offered a selective account of the health-care debates that took place in 2017. \u201cWhen we couldn\u2019t pass the repeal of Obamacare the first way through, an amendment came because the Freedom Caucus wouldn\u2019t vote for\u201d the initial House bill, McCarthy said. \u201cThat amendment put [the] preexisting condition campaign against us, and so even people who are running for the very first time got attacked on that. And that was the defining issue and the most important issue in the race.\u201d \u201cMcCarthy\u2019s account accurately describes the dynamics of passing the American Health Care Act, the Republican ACA alternative, in 2017,\u201d Mike reports. \u201cBut it sidesteps the Republican leadership\u2019s role in backing what became known as the MacArthur Amendment and ultimately forcing a vote on a bill that faced uncertain prospects in the Senate and put scores of GOP lawmakers on the political defensive.\u201d McCarthy spokesman Matt Sparks told The Post the GOP leader \u201chas been clear-eyed on what went wrong last cycle and no one is more committed to doing everything necessary to win back the House and execute an agenda that offers every American limitless potential to get ahead.\u201d (iStock) OUCH: The Texas Department of Insurance is experiencing a serious backlog of requests from patients seeking the state\u2019s help in dealing with surprise medical bills. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take us a while to get out of this backlog that we\u2019re in, but we\u2019re doing the things necessary to help more consumers,\u201d Chris Herrick, the department\u2019s associate commissioner, told the Texas Tribune\u2019s Jay Root and Shannon Najmabadi. \u201cThe overwhelmed state mediation program highlights the widespread problem of surprise emergency medical bills, an issue that has sparked bipartisan outrage in Washington and Austin alike,\u201d Jay and Shannon write. They write the issue of surprise medical bills arises when insurers and health-care providers disagree on the price of a treatment, meaning\u00a0patients are stuck with a bill to pay for costs insurers won\u2019t cover. It appears to be a major concern in Texas, where one\u00a0in three\u00a0emergency room visits leads to a surprise medical bill, the Texas Association of Health Plans says, which is twice the national average, Jay and Shannon write. And requests for help have spiked through the mediation program\u00a0created in 2009. \u201cTo put the demand in perspective, the Texas Department of Insurance received just 43 requests for mediation in 2013,\u201d they write. \u201cThe following year, the number surged to more than 600 \u2014 and the numbers have climbed steeply ever since. The requests hit a record high of 4,519 in 2018, and regulators expect 8,000 this fiscal year.\u201d Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.). (Carlos Osorio\/AP) \u2014 Stay tuned for the latest health-care proposal from Democrats. Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Reps. Brian Higgins (D-N.Y.) and Joe Courtney (D-Conn.) are planning to announce legislation allowing people the option of buying in to Medicare between the ages of 50 to 64. They are scheduled to hold a news conference on the \"Medicare at 50\u201d act at noon.\u00a0 \u2014 First in The Health 202: A coalition of health-care industry groups called Partnership for America's Health Care Future is\u00a0sending a letter to\u00a0 congressional leaders urging them to quash that bill and any other\u00a0Medicare-for-All-like efforts.\u00a0\u00a0 \"We want to work with you to improve what\u2019s working and fix what\u2019s broken \u2013 not start over,\" writes the group, which includes America's Health Insurance Plans and Pharmaceutical Researchers and Manufacturers of America.\u00a0\"We urge you to oppose single payer health care solutions and work with us to ensure the best of the free market and the strength of public programs can deliver real solutions that lower costs, increase patient choice, and improve quality.\" Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). (Charles Krupa\/AP) \u2014 Meanwhile, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who is considering a bid for the White House, signaled support for a Medicare option at age 50. Asked about his view of the \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d proposals that have been pushed by others in the Democratic party, Brown said he believes in \u201cuniversal coverage.\u201d \u201cI want to get something done now,\u201d he said at a breakfast event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to repeal Obamacare;\u00a0I want to add to Obamacare, and I want to help people now.\u201d \u201cIf you \u2026 allow voluntary buy-in at 50, that\u2019s not just practical and smart, it will help people today;\u00a0it will make a difference in people\u2019s lives as soon as it becomes law,\u201d he continued. He said\u00a0after starting with such a Medicare buy-in option, \u201cover time, people will see how well this works.\u201d \u201cEventually we probably get to something like \u2018Medicare-for-all,\u2019 \u201d he said, \u201cbut we start by expanding it and helping people now. It will make a huge difference.\u201d \u2014 Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering running for president, expressed his opposition to Medicare-for-all during a CNN town hall, saying it \u201cgives me another opportunity to talk about the extreme left and the extreme right.\u201d \u201cWe have a health care crisis in the country on many levels, but Republicans for 10 years \u2026 have done everything possible to eradicate the Affordable Care Act, and they\u2019ve done that without offering any plan. This is the far right,\u201d he said. \u201cThe far left is now suggesting Medicare-for-all. That is a $32 trillion number \u2026 Does anyone here really understand that Medicare-for-all means you will lose the choice of your doctor and insurance company?\u201d (iStock) \u2014 For the first time, a federal panel of health experts said it\u2019s urging doctors to identify women who may be at risk for perinatal depression because counseling can help prevent it. Up to one\u00a0in seven\u00a0women experience some form of depression during pregnancy or after childbirth, according to the U.S.\u00a0Preventive Services\u00a0Task Force, but it\u2019s now saying it has found a method to prevent the symptoms from setting in, the New York Times\u2019s Pam Belluck reports. \u201cThe guidelines marked the first time a national health organization has recommended anything to fend off the most common complication of pregnancy, and they amounted to a public call for health providers to seek out at-risk women and guide them to treatment,\u201d Pam writes. Perinatal depression can increase a woman\u2019s risk of suicidal symptoms and can also increase the chances of a baby being born prematurely or with a low birth weight, Pam reports. \u201cWe really need to find these women before they get depressed,\"\u00a0Karina Davidson, a task force member and senior vice president for research for Northwell Health, told Pam. Today From the Fact Checker: What's going on with tax cuts and tax refunds?\u00a0 Senate to vote on Green New Deal, says Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u00a0:","206":"The justices appointed by President Trump to the Supreme Court said Monday that the court should protect the ability of churches and other religious organizations to receive historic preservation funds from local governments. Such a case should not be \u201cdifficult,\u201d Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote in a statement joined by Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Samuel A. Alito Jr. Like Kavanaugh, Gorsuch was nominated by Trump. \u201cBarring religious organizations because they are religious from a general historic preservation grants program is pure discrimination against religion,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. Nonetheless, the three agreed with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to stay out of a New Jersey case in which the state\u2019s highest court said awarding historic preservation grants to churches with active worship programs violated the state constitution. Kavanaugh said \u201cfactual uncertainty\u201d about which kinds of buildings in Morris County, N.J., are covered by the preservation program makes this case a poor vehicle for deciding the constitutional issue at stake. But he said the court should be open for taking up a similar case. Kavanaugh\u2019s opinion comes a week after the court listened to arguments about the most high-profile case of its term regarding the separation of church and state: whether the 40-foot Bladensburg Peace Cross on public land in a Maryland town is an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion. The justices indicated in that argument that they might be looking for a narrow way to leave in place the cross, erected nearly 100 years ago by private families and organizations as a memorial to World War I dead. It was erected on private land now overseen by a government commission. In the New Jersey case, the Morris County Board of Chosen Freeholders awarded $4.6\u00a0million over a three-year period to repair 12 churches as part of a historic preservation program. But the New Jersey Supreme Court said that would violate a 240-year-old provision in the state constitution that bans the use of public funds to build or repair places of worship. That court distinguished the program from the Supreme Court\u2019s 2017 decision in Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia v. Comer , which said it was unconstitutional for Missouri to deny a grant for playground resurfacing to a religious school while providing money to similarly situated nonreligious schools. The New Jersey court said: \u201cThis case does not involve the expenditure of taxpayer money for non-religious uses, such as the playground resurfacing in Trinity Lutheran. The appeal instead relates to grants that sustain the continued use of active houses of worship for religious services and finance repairs to religious imagery. In our judgment, those grants constitute an impermissible religious use of public funds.\u201d But Kavanaugh said the decision of the New Jersey court \u201cis in serious tension with this court\u2019s religious equality precedents.\u201d Those decisions, he said, repeatedly held that \u201cgovernmental discrimination against religion \u2014 in particular, discrimination against religious persons, religious organizations, and religious speech \u2014 violates\u201d constitutional protections of the free exercise of religion and equal protection. The combined cases were Morris County Board of Freeholders v. Freedom From Religion Foundation and The Presbyterian Church in Morristown v. Freedom From Religion Foundation. Kavanaugh\u2019s statement came as the court decided three noncontroversial cases. He wrote one of those opinions, deciding the meaning of a federal statute that allows one side to recover the \u201cfull costs\u201d of litigation. The court unanimously overturned a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit that allowed expenses not specifically included within the six categories of costs identified in the statute. Kavanaugh explained how the word \u201cfull\u201d operates in the statute. \u201cA \u2018full breakfast\u2019 means breakfast, not lunch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA \u2018full season ticket plan\u2019 means tickets, not hot dogs. So too, the term \u2018full costs\u2019 means costs, not other expenses.\u201d The discerning reader might recall the controversy during Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation over revelations of his large credit card debts. He explained that he had bought season tickets to Washington Nationals baseball games for a group of friends and been later reimbursed. The case is Rimini Street Inc. v. Oracle USA Inc. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the other two opinions, one related to a tax dispute involving an injured railroad employee and the other involving the timing of a copyright-infringement suit. Ginsburg, who turns 86 this month, missed a session of the court\u2019s oral arguments because of a December surgery to remove malignant nodules from her lung. Some on fringe-right social media suggested that she had died or was in a coma. But she has now written more majority opinions than any other justice this term. The copyright case was argued while she was recuperating at home in January, with the justice reading briefs and following transcripts of the arguments. The cases are BNSF Railway Co. v. Loos and Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v Wall-Street.com.","207":"With Joanie Greve: THE BIG IDEA: INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \u2014 Liberal activist Van Jones protested the Koch brothers outside their donor meeting in 2011. Groups funded by the billionaire-backed network had successfully clamored for his ouster as President Barack Obama\u2019s green jobs czar two years earlier, labeling him a dangerous radical. At the 2019 Koch seminar, however, there is a giant banner with Jones\u2019s smiling face hanging inside the lobby of the posh hotel that\u2019s hosting the meeting. He\u2019s literally become the poster child for how the network of conservative and libertarian donors hopes to seek out unlikely allies to advance its agenda. Jones, now a CNN talking head, recorded a video with Koch Industries general counsel Mark Holden about their partnership to pass the First Step Act, a sweeping overhaul of the criminal justice system that President Trump signed into law last month. \u201cThe problem is there\u2019s a lot of stuff we do agree on that we aren\u2019t working on together,\u201d Jones says in the video, which organizers played on Sunday for 634 donors who have each agreed to contribute at least $100,000 per year to Koch-sponsored groups. \u201cYou\u2019ve got awesome people and beautiful people on both sides.\u201d You could be forgiven for thinking you accidentally showed up for a No Labels conference. That\u2019s been the vibe here in the Coachella Valley all weekend as the network aggressively seeks to rebrand itself as kinder, gentler and less political.  Wearing purple, the color of bipartisanship, industrialist Charles Koch \u2014 who remains a boogeyman on the left \u2014 declared that his top goal is \u201cuniting with people across the whole spectrum, including those who have been adversaries in the past,\u201d to pursue shared priorities. \u201cThis attitude of holding things against others who have different beliefs is tearing our country apart,\u201d the 83-year-old said during a cocktail reception on Saturday night. \u201cWhat we need to do, and what we\u2019re doing, is bringing people together.\u201d His brother David stepped away from the network last year, citing poor health. Charles has concluded that reaching across the aisle to build coalitions is the best way to maximize his network\u2019s impact with a president in the White House he personally doesn\u2019t like but whom many members of his network do. The network plans to stay out of the presidential race again in 2020, as it did in 2016. -- Koch World believes the sentencing bill is its new recipe for success. In that video, Jones accuses what he calls the \u201cliberal establishment\u201d \u2014 naming groups such as the ACLU and NAACP \u2014 of playing politics during negotiations over the bill. \u201cPublicly they were saying it doesn\u2019t go far enough,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think privately they just didn\u2019t want Trump to have a victory.\u201d Americans for Prosperity chief executive Emily Seidel said many Republican lawmakers had the same mentality when they were in the wilderness. \u201cJust a few years ago, Republican after Republican told us they didn\u2019t want to give Obama a win on this issue,\u201d she told donors. Even though the president has attacked Koch personally, network officials were still able to work constructively with White House senior adviser Jared Kushner on criminal justice. \u201cIt shows how you can break though the partisan gridlock, and it\u2019s the model for everything else we\u2019ll do going forward,\u201d Seidel said. Indeed, the president\u2019s son-in-law appeared in the same video as Jones. \u201cOne of the things that really surprised people, including myself, was how broad the coalition we were able to build was,\u201d Kushner said. Koch officials were back at the White House last week for a meeting on a potential immigration deal that could protect \u201cdreamers\u201d in exchange for wall money, and they\u2019re scheduled to return later this week.\u00a0 Brian Hooks and Charles Koch address donors during a cocktail reception on Saturday night. (Seminar Network) -- In past years, network leaders announced how much money they planned to spend on politics and policy in the upcoming election cycle. This year, they\u2019re not providing a target. Brian Hooks, the chairman of the Seminar Network, which includes the constellation of Koch groups, said they still plan to devote \u201csignificant resources\u201d but that the opportunities will dictate the amount. \u201cWe see this as the next big step forward in the evolution of this network,\u201d Hooks said. The network continues to increase financial support for nonprofits focused on civil society. That\u2019s how Koch wound up hugging Deion Sanders on Saturday night. The donors have invested heavily in Urban Specialists, which helps the disadvantaged in South Dallas, as well as other groups that the former Cowboys cornerback is involved with. \u201cThe Kochs make me smile,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThis is no sham. This is no gimmick. \u2026 I can see through the smoke at 51 years old. They are who they say they are and more.\u201d Speaking before a dinner program on Saturday night, Sanders addressed the 181 first-time attendees: \u201cTo all the newcomers, I just challenge you to get in the game.\u201d Koch got up from his seat, and the two embraced afterward. The discussion that followed over dinner was about the Charles Koch Foundation\u2019s Courageous Collaborations initiative, which was launched to support research on overcoming intolerance. One entity getting a big grant is StoryCorps and its One Small Step program, which brings together people who have opposing political views so they can have respectful conversations. (The StoryCorps van, which has a sound booth inside, was parked on the well-manicured lawn next to the swimming pool so that donors could record their personal stories of overcoming political differences.) Dave Isay, the founder of StoryCorps, said his wife recently made him watch a documentary on Netflix about Roger Stone called \u201cGet Me Roger Stone.\u201d In the film, Stone says one of his \u201crules\u201d is that hate is a more powerful motivator than love. \u201cWe have to prove Roger Stone wrong,\u201d Isay declared. The crowd cheered. \u201cWe\u2019re in an existential crisis here,\u201d Isay continued. \u201cDemocracy cannot survive in a swamp of mutual contempt. \u2026 I don\u2019t know that this country can survive if we all despise each other. You don\u2019t have to change your mind about something. You just have to realize the person you\u2019re talking to is a human being. And we\u2019re not doing that.\u201d The sun sets Saturday at the Renaissance Indian Wells Resort, where the Koch network holds its seminar each winter. (James Hohmann\/The Washington Post) -- To be sure, the Koch network remains a potent political force on the right. Since Trump took office, Koch-linked groups have successfully pushed for deregulation, tax cuts and judicial appointments that will significantly benefit the bottom line of many network donors and the businesses they run. But they\u2019ve been stymied in their demands for free trade, a more open immigration system and deficit reduction. It was opposition to President George W. Bush\u2019s steel tariffs that inspired Koch to convene the first seminar of like-minded business types in 2003. The network has gathered twice a year ever since. Network officials identified 10 \u201cbarriers\u201d preventing people from realizing their full potential: bad fiscal policy, overregulation, cronyism, joblessness, a failing education system, persistent poverty, counterproductive immigration policy, free speech restrictions, a broken criminal justice system and tariffs. The sessions that were open to reporters focused primarily on the poor and the imprisoned. -- One big change from past Koch donor seminars is the relative absence of politicians. This twice-annual retreat used to be one of the premier cattle calls for Republicans with presidential ambitions to cultivate the biggest donors on the right. But fewer and fewer have been invited, and others have chosen to stay away because of the optics \u2014 and the fear that their presence will be used against them in attack ads. Only three elected officials are at this seminar, which continues through Monday night, and none are members of the House. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) touted his bipartisan work with potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including teaming up with Bernie Sanders to cut off U.S. support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen and with Cory Booker to allow a vegan company to sell \u201cmayonnaise\u201d without eggs. Over breakfast on Sunday, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) gave a talk about his book \u201cThem: Why We Hate Each Other \u2014 and How to Heal.\u201d Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R), who has been an ally of the Koch network on criminal justice, also flew in. Alice Marie Johnson, whose life sentence was commuted by President Trump, hugs Emily Seidel, the chief executive of Americans for Prosperity, at the Koch donor retreat on Sunday. (Seminar Network) -- Instead of giving politicians a platform, organizers showcased several regular people with sympathetic personal stories in an effort to humanize the issues they\u2019re focused on. Last June, for example, Trump commuted the life sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a grandmother in her 60s from Tennessee who has been serving a life term since 1996 for nonviolent, first-time drug offenses. The president acted after reality TV star Kim Kardashian West brought the case to his attention. The Koch network had been highlighting her case for some time, and she thanked the donors for their support in a speech. \u201cI\u2019m the living proof that second chances work,\u201d Johnson said, fighting back tears. \u201cOne thing I know for sure is that people don\u2019t remember statistics, but they remember a face.\u201d The crowd responded with a standing ovation. The Koch network also flew in Melony Armstrong, an African American woman from Mississippi who wanted to braid hair but didn\u2019t have a cosmetology license. The Koch network has made her the face of its effort to relax occupational licensing laws across the country. Armstrong received training from the network, and it deployed significant resources to successfully change the laws in her home state in 2017. Nebraska last year and Ohio this month passed similar bills after Koch lobbying. -- \u201cWe\u2019re getting much better at storytelling,\u201d Holden said in an interview. He\u2019s been a top Koch lieutenant for more than two decades and is the network\u2019s point man on criminal justice. \u201cI\u2019m by nature a litigator,\u201d he said. \u201cI like facts and figures. That\u2019s okay. But that doesn\u2019t move the needle. You tell the stories about people \u2014 human beings \u2014 that changes everything. \u2026 We know we have the facts and the figures \u2026 but when you get the emotion on your side, and the stories on your side, it\u2019s over. You\u2019re going to win.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important to put human faces on problems,\u201d added James Davis, who oversees communications for the Koch network. \u201cStats don\u2019t convey empathy.\u201d Weldon Angelos\u00a0poses for a portrait in July 2015 at a federal prison in California. (Nikki Kahn\/The Washington Post) -- One major focus of this meeting has been encouraging attendees to hire more ex-cons to ease their reentry into society. The people attending the seminar collectively employ upward of 2 million people. (The Washington Post and a handful of other news outlets were invited to cover the gathering on the sole condition that they not identify participants in the crowd without their permission.) Koch, worth somewhere around $50 billion, is one of the 10 richest men in the world. His company \u201cbanned the box,\u201d which means that job applicants aren\u2019t asked about prior criminal convictions anymore. \u201cWhatever we\u2019re doing in business, we haven\u2019t scratched the surface,\u201d Koch said in a speech Sunday. \u201cIf all of us join together, just think about the difference we can make.\u201d The head of the Society for Human Resource Management unveiled a new website at the meeting on Sunday, GettingTalentBacktoWork.com, for corporate leaders to sign a pledge that they will hire more formerly incarcerated people. Richard Branson recorded a video greeting touting his company Virgin\u2019s efforts to hire former convicts. \u201cHello, Charles,\u201d the billionaire said in the taped message. \u201cCheers.\u201d After lobbying by the Koch network, Weldon Angelos of Utah was released in 2015 after serving 11 years of a 55-year prison term in connection with selling marijuana. His case had become a symbol of excessive mandatory minimums. Once he got out, a Koch donor from Colorado hired him at his company. The two came onstage Sunday afternoon with their arms draped over each other\u2019s shoulders. They departed to \u201cHere Comes the Sun.\u201d There have been many moments like this in the heavily choreographed program. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d said Kevin Gentry, a top Koch aide who works on special projects and fundraising for the network. \u201cA few minutes ago, one of our first-timers grabbed me and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to tell you. This meeting is nothing like I thought it was going to be. When did you start this new thing?\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve got to tell you, whenever it was we started it, we should have done it a long time ago.\u2019\u201d WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: Zalmay Khalilzad, special adviser on reconciliation, speaks during a news conference in Kabul. (Rafiq Maqbool\/AP) -- The chief U.S. negotiator in Afghanistan said American and Taliban forces have agreed in principle to a peace framework that could lead to the full removal of U.S. troops. The New York Times\u2019s Mujib Mashal reports: \u201c\u2018We have a draft of the framework that has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement,\u2019 the American envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, said in an interview with The New York Times in Kabul. \u2018The Taliban have committed, to our satisfaction, to do what is necessary that would prevent Afghanistan from ever becoming a platform for international terrorist groups or individuals.\u2019 \u2026 After nine years of halting efforts to reach a peace deal with the Taliban, the draft framework, though preliminary, is the biggest tangible step toward ending a two-decade war that has cost tens of thousands of lives and profoundly changed American foreign policy.\u201d Trump gestures while speaking about tariffs in the Cabinet Room of the White House. (Jacquelyn Martin\/AP) -- A new Post-ABC poll found Trump is falling short of the modest expectations voters had when he assumed office two years ago. Dan Keating and Dan Balz report: At the time of his inauguration, \u201croughly 6 in 10 Americans expected him to perform well on [the economy]. Today, the public is divided evenly, with 49 percent giving him positive marks on his handling of the economy and 49 percent giving him negative marks. Even those most optimistic or pessimistic are split evenly, 27 percent saying his handling has been 'excellent'\u00a0and 27 percent saying it\u2019s been 'poor.'\u00a0The starkest gap between Trump\u2019s current ratings and Americans\u2019 initially positive expectations is on the federal deficit. Two years ago, 50 percent of Americans thought Trump would do an excellent or good job handling the deficit. The new poll finds 33 percent saying he has done well so far, a 17-point drop that occurred across party lines. \u2026 \u201cAnother issue where Trump has performed below initial expectations is on health care, where his positive ratings have fallen from 44 percent to 33 percent. The sharpest falloff came among independents, from 48 percent saying they expected him to do a good job with the issue to the current 22 percent. \u2026 Along with the deficit and healthcare, Americans grade Trump the worst on issues dealing with women and race relations, both areas in which Trump started with low expectations. Roughly one-third say Trump has done an excellent or good job on each in his first two years, with more than 6 in 10 adults calling his performance poor or not so good.\u201d Visitors walk near the Nissan logo at a\u00a0showroom in Tokyo.

(Alex Horton) THE GOVERNMENT REOPENS \u2014 FOR NOW: -- Federal employees will return to work today, but it could take months to sort through the backlog created by the longest shutdown in U.S. history. Lisa Rein, Juliet Eilperin and Sarah Kaplan report: \u201cThe National Park Service will need to restore basic amenities at hundreds of parks and monuments, removing accumulated trash and plowing multiple feet of snow. The Bureau of Indian Affairs must quickly issue grants to head off food shortages and a health-care crisis for Native American tribal members whose funding was cut off. Inspectors returning from furlough to the National Transportation Safety Board will have to decide which of the almost 100 rail, plane and highway crashes to investigate first. And the Internal Revenue Service will race to train employees to implement changes to the tax code and hire thousands of temporary workers for tax season. \u2026 But many workers say they\u2019re still anxious. They won\u2019t see the back pay they\u2019re owed until later this week. And [Trump] has threatened another closure in three weeks if his demands for border wall funding aren\u2019t met.\u201d -- With the government reopened, House Democrats and Senate Republicans plan to pivot toward other parts of their agenda. The New York Times\u2019s Nicholas Fandos reports: \u201cThe House, which spent weeks passing futile bills to reopen the government, will turn to legislation higher on the Democrats\u2019 priority list, including a bill to raise pay for civilian federal employees. Leading Democrats also plan to reintroduce a marquee bill to close the pay gap between men and women that they have fought to enact for years. In the Senate, Republicans will try to push through a bipartisan Middle East policy bill that includes a disputed provision targeting the movement to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel. \u2026 And in both chambers, lawmakers have teed up a high-impact lineup of hearings \u2014 effectively the first of the year.\u201d -- Federal contractors\u2019 lost wages may never be reimbursed. Aaron C. Davis and Neena Satija report: \u201cHow the shutdown so quickly shredded the personal safety net of employees at [the contracting firm] Unispec reflects the razor-thin profit margin and unsettled nature of business for government contracting firms and their employees. \u2026 Unlike the 800,000 career federal employees who have been promised full back pay in coming days, government contractors \u2014 who are thought to number in the millions \u2014 have no legal claim to the five weeks of lost wages. And because Unispec cannot pay its employees until it has billed the government and received payment for their work, it will be another four full weeks, Feb. 28, before [its workers are] eligible to receive a complete paycheck ...\u00a0And in the government\u2019s temporary reopening, even that is no certainty.\u201d -- Many government workers are still relying on donations to cover basic necessities until they can collect their paychecks later this week. Katie Zezima reports: \u201cAt least 20 diaper banks across the country have provided diapers, feminine and incontinence products, formula and more to federal employees ... Diaper banks started to receive calls for help in mid-January, and the entreaties became more and more desperate the longer the shutdown went on ... The requests continue even though the government is set to reopen, and groups are planning to hand out diapers and other products this week.\u201d -- The bill that reopened the government also extended the Violence Against Women Act through Feb. 15. From Elise Viebeck: \u201cThe landmark 1994 law expired in late December after multiple short-term extensions, a blow to lawmakers and activists who have sought a long-term reauthorization. The government shutdown had also caused a delay in payments to VAWA-funded programs.\u201d -- Democratic legislators in Maryland are moving forward with a proposal to allow furloughed federal workers to collect state unemployment insurance. Arelis R. Hern\u00e1ndez reports: \u201cAlthough [the shutdown] ended Friday, state lawmakers say they are eager to correct what they call an anomaly in the law that disqualifies exempted workers from applying for benefits if another shutdown were to occur.\u201d -- Craft breweries are acutely feeling the\u00a0reverberations of the shutdown. Jenna Portnoy reports: \u201cThey lost revenue they will never recoup and will continue to lose money while they wait for federal agencies that process labels, brewery permits and small-business loans to clear a backlog built up during the shutdown. During the closure, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau within the Treasury Department stopped approving new labels, hamstringing businesses that consistently churn out new products. \u2026 Wineries and small-batch distilleries don\u2019t face the same conundrum because their products take longer to produce and are not released as often as craft beers.\u201d THE IMMIGRATION WARS CONTINUE: -- Trump is again considering declaring a national emergency\u00a0to get wall funding by Feb. 15, the next deadline by which the government must be funded. Robert Costa and Felicia Sonmez report: \u201c\u2018The president\u2019s commitment is to defend the nation, and he will do it either with or without Congress,\u2019 acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said on \u2018Fox News Sunday.\u2019 \u2026 Inside the West Wing over the weekend, Trump told advisers that declaring a national emergency may be his best option as he scrambles to assert himself in a divided government and secure wall funding, according to four people involved in the discussions \u2026 One White House official described Trump\u2019s decision to reopen the government as \u2018clearing the deck\u2019 for executive action rather than a retreat. And a longtime confidant said Trump has grown increasingly frustrated by news coverage of his concession to Democrats and has been encouraged by conservative allies to escalate the fight. \u201cA bipartisan, bicameral congressional committee has been charged with brokering an agreement on border security ...\u00a0In an\u00a0interview with the Wall Street Journal\u00a0on Sunday, Trump said he thinks the committee\u2019s chances of success are \u2018less than 50-50,\u2019 although there are \u2018a lot of very good people\u2019 on it. He also said that another shutdown is \u2018certainly an option\u2019 and voiced doubt that he would back any deal with less than $5.7\u00a0billion in border wall funding. \u2026 Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called the prospect of a national-emergency declaration a \u2018terrible idea,\u2019 reflecting widespread conservative unease about using executive powers in sweeping ways to achieve political ends, a tactic they have long criticized Democratic presidents of employing. \u2026 Still, other Republicans said the GOP appetite for using emergency powers was stronger than the remarks of lawmakers on television suggested because of the expectation that the party\u2019s base would applaud Trump for being bold. \u2026 \u201cSeveral White House officials said privately Sunday that Trump has argued that a national-emergency declaration in the coming weeks could pressure Congress to include wall funding as part of a broader legislative package next month and could signal to the GOP\u2019s core voters that the president is going to extremes to secure funding for his campaign\u2019s biggest pledge. Mulvaney said that if the legislation Congress sends to the president\u2019s desk is unsatisfactory, Trump could veto it. \u2018Yeah. I think he actually is,\u2019 Mulvaney said on CBS\u2019s \u2018Face the Nation\u2019 when asked whether Trump is prepared to bring about a shutdown next month.\u201d Behind the scenes: \u201cThe White House Counsel\u2019s Office, led by Pat Cipollone, has prepared drafts of declarations, and Trump spent much of Thursday night reviewing them in the White House residence as he watched TV coverage of the shutdown ... Angry with Democrats\u2019 refusal to bend to his demands, in particular with [Nancy Pelosi], Trump pressed Cipollone for guidance about the potential legal repercussions and called friends, such as Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, to hear their views about the negotiations.\u201d -- A senior Border Patrol official emailed agents asking for any information that might be used to back up Trump\u2019s specious claims that human traffickers are gagging women with duct tape after a Post article raised questions about a story the president keeps telling. Vox\u2019s Dara Lind reports: The email\u00a0\u201cwas sent as a \u2018request for information\u2019 by an assistant Border Patrol chief, apparently on behalf of the office of Customs and Border Protection commissioner Kevin McAleenan (referred to internally as \u2018C-1\u2019). It asked agents to reply within less than two hours with \u2018any information (in any format)\u2019 regarding claims of tape-gagged women \u2014 and even linked to the Post article \u2018for further info.\u2019 Vox\u2019s source indicated that they and others in their sector hadn\u2019t heard anything that would back up Trump\u2019s claims, but wasn\u2019t sure if agents in other sectors had provided information. However, no one from the Trump administration has come forward to offer evidence for the claim, either before or after the internal Border Patrol email was sent.\u201d -- The administration is falling well short of Trump\u2019s order to hire 15,000 new border and immigration officers. The LA Times\u2019s Molly O'Toole reports: \u201cIn a sign of the difficulties, [CBP] allocated $60.7 million to Accenture Federal Services, a management consulting firm, as part of a $297-million contract to recruit, vet and hire 7,500 border officers over five years, but the company has produced only 33 new hires so far. \u2026 The Border Patrol gained a total of 120 agents in 2018, the first net gain in five years. But the agency has come nowhere close to adding more than 2,700 agents annually, the rate that [McAleenan] has said is necessary to meet Trump\u2019s mandated 26,370 border agents by the end of 2021.\u201d Kamala Harris waves to the crowd as she formally launches her presidential campaign in Oakland, Calif. (Tony Avelar\/AP) 2020 WATCH: -- Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) formally launched her presidential campaign on Sunday afternoon with a massive rally in her hometown.\u00a0Matt Viser reports\u00a0from Oakland, Calif.: \u201cAgainst a backdrop of giant American flags and, off to the side, flags from every state and territory, Harris spoke to a crowd estimated at 20,000 people that flooded a downtown square and spread into surrounding streets. Against the pomp, her message was blunt. \u2018Too many unarmed black men and women are killed in America. Too many black and brown Americans are being locked up,\u2019 she said, in what was a recurring theme throughout her 35-minute speech. \u2018Our criminal justice system needs drastic repair. Let\u2019s speak that truth.\u2019 \u2026 \u201cHarris, 54, framed her campaign as a response to President Trump, highlighting how he has divided the country and attempting to make the case that she would unite it. \u2018People in power are trying to convince us that the villain in our American story is each other,\u2019 she said. \u2018But that is not our story. That is not who we are. That\u2019s not our America. You see, our United States of America is not about us versus them. It\u2019s about \u2018we, the people.\u2019\u2019 She mocked Trump\u2019s foreign policy: \u2018We have foreign powers infecting the White House like malware.\u2019 She ridiculed his immigration stance: \u2018When we have children in cages, crying for their mothers and fathers, don\u2019t you dare call that border security \u2014 that\u2019s a human rights abuse. And that\u2019s not our America.\u2019 In implicit rebukes to a president known for falsehoods, she repeatedly said she would be an honest broker. \u2018Seek truth, speak truth and fight for the truth,\u2019 she said. \u2026 \u201cHarris infused her speech with her biography \u2014 the daughter of a mother who emigrated from India and a father who emigrated from Jamaica, the first to research breast cancer and the second an economics professor\u00a0\u2026 Polls have found that many Democratic voters have no clear view of who Harris is or what she stands for. So in addition to delivering a serving of her biography, she also sought to outline some of her agenda. She advocated a Medicare-for-all plan, a tax proposal that would reverse the Republican-passed tax cuts and instead provide middle-class families with tax breaks of up to $500 a month, making pre-K access universal and making college debt-free.\u201d -- \u201cHarris has stoked a perception that she is not just an elite candidate, but among the Democratic front-runners \u2014 a designation that is loaded with both upside and danger in this very early stage of presidential jockeying,\u201d the Los Angeles Times\u2019s Melanie Mason and Mark Z. Barabak report:\u00a0\u201cThe California senator and her campaign strategists aren\u2019t yet declaring her the favorite. But her days-long debut, crafted for maximum impact, showed a desire to make a big and early splash.\u201d -- Howard Schultz told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d he is \u201cseriously thinking of running for president\u201d as an independent, stoking Democratic fears the former Starbucks chief executive could inadvertently help reelect Trump. Michael Scherer reports: \u201cDemocrats fear a credible third-party candidacy could allow Trump to win states he otherwise would have lost or push a decision on the election to the U.S. House, where Republicans currently have an advantage in the number of state delegations they control \u2026 As [presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro and other Democrats] suggested, their worry is that a three-way race would split Trump\u2019s opposition, while the president\u2019s support would remain intact.\u201d -- CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny reports that Hillary Clinton has been telling friends she has not totally closed the door on a 2020 campaign. \u201cI'm told by three people that as recently as this week, she was telling people that look, given all this news from the indictments, particularly the Roger Stone indictment, she talked to several people, saying 'look, I'm not closing the doors to this,'\" Zeleny said. But he added, \u201cit does not mean that there's a campaign-in-waiting, or a plan in the works.\u201d Another close Clinton friend told Zeleny that \u201cit would surprise me greatly if she actually did it.\u201d -- Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper (D) returned to Iowa as he nears a final decision on launching a presidential bid. The Denver Post\u2019s Nic Garcia reports: \u201cHickenlooper, the two-term governor who finished his term earlier this month, articulated his vision of governing that is based more on consensus building and less on conflict. At a house party in this Des Moines suburb, he also shared his personal and political biography while answering questions about health care, immigration and abortion rights. \u2018I\u2019m not just frustrated \u2014 I\u2019m over-the-top angry about what\u2019s happened to the country in such a short period of time,\u2019 he said, adding: \u2018I don\u2019t think there is anyone else that can reliably \u2014 as I can \u2014 beat Donald Trump. \u2026 My whole public life has been about bringing people together.\u2019\u201d -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is relying on her policy expertise to set herself apart from other presidential candidates. The New York Times\u2019s Astead W. Herndon reports: \u201cWhile other Democrats have focused on sweeping themes of unity or change ...\u00a0Ms. Warren is making a personal and political wager that audiences care more about policy savvy than captivating oration. It is a bet intended to draw contrasts with [Trump], who rarely delves into policy, but also to put pressure on Democratic rivals. In what promises to be a nomination contest featuring many candidates with broadly similar ideologies, a strategy of highlighting even the smallest differences in policy could pay off, especially with liberal voters who want firm and thorough positions rather than squishy generalities that could be setups for compromise.\u201d -- Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) has bragged about his collaboration with Democratic legislators as he eyes a primary challenge against Trump, but his tenure has included moments of divisive partisanship. Ovetta Wiggins and Arelis R. Hern\u00e1ndez report: \u201cHe called political opponents \u2018thugs,\u2019\u00a0barred more than 450 critics\u00a0from his official Facebook page and sometimes took credit for Democratic legislation he had initially opposed. Leading Democrats in Annapolis say the governor was easier to work with in the second half of his term, an evolution that could reflect the divisiveness in Washington or his gubernatorial reelection campaign.\u201d THERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Roger Stone dodged a question about whether he would consider cooperating with special counsel Bob Mueller after his indictment. From Elise Viebeck: \u201c\u2018That\u2019s a question that I\u2019d have to determine after my attorneys have some discussion,\u2019 the longtime Republican operative and friend of [Trump] told ABC\u2019s \u2018This Week\u2019 on Sunday. \u2018If there\u2019s wrongdoing by other people in the campaign that I didn\u2019t know about \u2014 which I know of none \u2014 but if there is, I would certainly testify honestly.\u2019 Stone added that he would \u2018also testify honestly about any other matter, including any communications with the president,\u2019 but he said their discussions were \u2018political in nature\u2019 and denied \u2018categorically\u2019 that they spoke about Russia or Mueller\u2019s investigation during or after the 2016 campaign. \u2026\u00a0 \u201cTrump on Saturday night seemed to distance himself from Stone, tweeting: \u2018Roger Stone didn\u2019t even work for me anywhere near the Election!\u2019 \u2018What about the Fake and Unverified \u201cDossier,\u201d a total phony conjob, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary to damage me and the Trump Campaign?\u2019 he tweeted.\u201d -- It remains unclear why several of Trump\u2019s former advisers felt compelled to lie to investigators about their activities during the 2016 campaign, Rosalind S. Helderman, Josh Dawsey and Matt Zapotosky report. \u201cDid the president\u2019s men lie to protect a still-hidden dark secret about the campaign\u2019s interaction with Russia, engaging in a broad effort to obstruct the probe \u2014 one that included perhaps even Trump? Did they lie to avoid diminishing Trump\u2019s victory by acknowledging Russia played a role in his election? Did they each lie for their own reasons, taking their cue from the president \u2014 who has told many whoppers of his own, including about Russia? Trump\u2019s former\u00a0campaign chairman,\u00a0deputy campaign manager,\u00a0former national security adviser,\u00a0personal lawyer\u00a0and a\u00a0campaign foreign policy adviser\u00a0have all been accused of lying to investigators exploring Russia activity. \u2026 The deception by Trump advisers that has led to guilty pleas so far does have a common throughline: Much of it centers on their interactions about Russia.\u201d -- Chris Christie claims in his new book the president and Jared Kushner thought firing Michael Flynn would end the \u201cRussia thing.\u201d The New York Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman reports: \u201cOn Feb. 14, 2017, Mr. Christie and his wife, Mary Pat, had lunch scheduled with the president. It happened to be the day after Mr. Flynn \u2014 whom Mr. Christie did not back for the national security adviser role \u2014 was dismissed for lying to the vice president about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the transition. Mr. Kushner decided to attend. As Mr. Kushner tucked into his \u2018typical salad,\u2019 Mr. Christie wrote, the president said to him, \u2018This Russia thing is all over now, because I fired Flynn.\u2019 Mr. Christie said that he started laughing, and the president asked why. \u2018\u201cSir,\u201d\u00a0I said, \u201cthis Russia thing is far from over,\u201d\u2019\u00a0Mr. Christie wrote. Mr. Trump responded: \u2018What do you mean? Flynn met with the Russians. That was the problem. I fired Flynn. It\u2019s over.\u2019 Mr. Kushner added, \u2018That\u2019s right, firing Flynn ends the whole Russia thing.\u2019 Mr. Christie, who wrote that it all sounded \u2018na\u00efve,\u2019 recalled Mr. Kushner telling him that he was \u2018crazy\u2019 when he said they would most likely still be discussing the Russia issue in February 2018.\u201d -- The Treasury Department officially lifted sanctions on three companies owned by Oleg Deripaska, the Russian oligarch and ally of Vladimir Putin. Jeanne Whalen reports: \u201cSanctions imposed last year against Deripaska himself will remain in force, as punishment for what Treasury has called his support for \u2018the Kremlin\u2019s global malign activities, including its attempts to subvert Western democracy.\u2019 Treasury said it agreed to lift the company sanctions because Deripaska has reduced his \u2018direct and indirect shareholding stake in these companies and severed his control.\u2019 Deripaska\u2019s stake in the holding company that controls [the aluminum company] Rusal \u2014 En Group \u2014 has been cut from 70 percent to 44.95 percent, En Group said Sunday.\u201d -- \u201cAfter the sanctions were officially lifted, EN announced the appointment of seven new directors under the deal, including Christopher Bancroft Burnham, a banker who served on Mr. Trump\u2019s State Department transition team and worked in George W. Bush\u2019s State Department,\u201d the New York Times\u2019s Kenneth P. Vogel notes. Opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, who declared himself interim president of Venezuela, greets supporters as he leaves a church in Caracas. (Fernando Llano\/AP) THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- Juan Guaid\u00f3, Venezuela's self-declared\u00a0interim president, said the opposition is in talks with military and civilian officials to force out President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Andreina Aponte, Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier report: \u201cBacked by the United States and a host of Latin American countries, Guaid\u00f3 also said the opposition will test the socialist government by bringing in food aid to ease a crippling humanitarian crisis. Guaid\u00f3 and his opposition are locked in a high-stakes play to drive Maduro from power. In Caracas, Maduro\u2019s top brass and defense minister have sworn their allegiance to him. \u2026 Guaid\u00f3 told The Post that talks with the military were proceeding behind the scenes. He also hailed a move on Saturday by Maduro\u2019s former military attache in Washington to switch allegiance to Guaid\u00f3.\u201d -- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he has recently heard Trump weigh military intervention in Venezuela, according to Axios\u2019s Jonathan Swan. \u201cGraham, recalling his conversation with Trump, said: \u2018He [Trump] said, \u201cWhat do you think about using military force?\u201d and I said, \u201cWell, you need to go slow on that, that could be problematic.\u201d\u00a0And he said, \u201cWell, I'm surprised, you want to invade everybody.\u201d\u2019 Graham laughed. \u2018And I said, \u201cI don't want to invade everybody, I only want to use the military when our national security interests are threatened.\u201d\u2019 \u2026 Venezuela is another case study of the new speed of Trump's foreign policy.\u201d -- The British Parliament\u2019s maneuvers in reaction to Brexit have been shaped by the unconventional speakership of John Bercow.

It is entirely possible the members will vote to delay the scheduled March 29 departure date or even stop Britain leaving the European Union without a deal. Such wily moves are prized by the lowly backbenchers, whom Bercow has showered with attention, and by those who want Parliament to be more assertive in dealing with Downing Street. But he has upset traditionalists and is loathed by Brexiteers who believe he is working to undermine Britain\u2019s departure from the E.U.\u201d -- Thousands wearing red scarves took to the streets of Paris to protest the \u201cyellow vest\u201d demonstrators. James McAuley reports: \u201cApproximately 10,500 people marched in Paris on Sunday, according to police figures. That was more than twice the number that donned yellow vests in the capital the day before, when about 4,000 marched in Paris and 69,000 marched nationwide, according to the Interior Ministry. \u2026 On Sunday, a diverse crowd \u2014 many in \u2018foulards rouges,\u2019 or red scarves, their own attempt at branding \u2014 gathered to decry the violent scenes the [yellow vest] movement has inspired, including anti-Semitic words and gestures, physical attacks on French journalists and even an attempt to break into a government building, which led to the evacuation of a government minister.\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Trump insisted he would build the wall: Meanwhile, the Texas Tribune corrected one of\u00a0Trump's tweets on immigration: The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee hammered Trump for his Russia connections: Kamala Harris's communications director loaned her boss something that once belonged to her grandmother Ann Richards, the former governor of Texas: Harris's husband tweeted photos from the launch: An LA Times writer noted this of Harris's launch: Another 2020 candidate emphasized her consistent voting record against Trump: Howard Schultz looked ahead to 2020: And many people asked him to reconsider.

But her way of expressing outrage was not. The issue she used to make her point was important on many levels. Observing the \u201cunease,\u201d even among many Republicans, over Trump\u2019s abuse of his power, she noted that \u201cif the president can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an emergency \u2014 an illusion that he wants to convey \u2014 just think of what a president with different values can present to the American people.\u201d And then she recalled the slaughter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 14, 2018, when 14 students and three staff members were gunned down. \u201cYou want to talk about a national emergency?\u201d Pelosi asked. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about today, the one-year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America. That\u2019s a national emergency. Why don\u2019t you declare that emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would.\u201d Our nation\u2019s deadly permissiveness toward firearms was very much on Pelosi\u2019s mind \u2014 even before Friday\u2019s shooting at an Aurora, Ill., warehouse that killed five people \u2014 because on Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee had voted 21 to 14 to send a bill requiring background checks for all gun sales to the House floor. It was the first serious vote on a gun-reform measure since 2013, when the Senate fell six votes short of the 60\u00a0needed to advance a background-checks bill proposed by Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.). It was also the most significant gun-sanity measure to move through the House Judiciary Committee since 1993. Yet, as important as this step was, it received scant media notice. The drowning out of news that mattered tells us a great deal about our political moment. It also underscores the challenge confronting those speaking for the vast majority of Americans who want action in the face of what Pelosi was right to call a national emergency on gun violence. In counting the many costs of the Trump era, we focus too rarely on the president\u2019s success in pushing divisive trivialities and self-interested contrivances to the center of national concern. He manufactures crises and then uses his manufactured crises to create new ones. There is no crisis at our nation\u2019s border. To the extent that there are border problems, his wall would do little or nothing to set things right. And Congress\u2019s decision not to finance Trump\u2019s monstrous waste of money in no way justifies his seizing of national emergency powers. His vast overreach really does create a crisis, which dominates the news and shoves aside all other concerns. But it is all part of the Triviality Feedback Loop that is the Trump presidency. In the meantime, problems that should engage our energy are forced to the back of the queue of public attention. The normal constitutional approaches to governing \u2014 bills passed through committees, compromises reached in conferences involving both parties and both houses of Congress \u2014 are no longer respected. And no matter how much journalists investigate and expose Trump\u2019s misconduct (we should be grateful for this), his I\u2019m-The-Only-One-Who-Matters approach to politics fits well with the needs of modern media, both social and traditional. Clicks, page views and ratings encourage everyone to dwell on individuals more than issues. This aggravates a profound preexisting cynicism about the possibilities of political action. And defeatism is especially damaging when it comes to guns. For decades, as one massacre cascaded into another, the gun lobby beat back even the most modest efforts to control access to firearms. The sense of doom about any progress is so deep that it obscures overwhelming evidence that the politics of guns have changed. Even the most moderate Democrats made opposition to the gun lobby a key component of their campaigns in 2018 \u2014 and in district after district, they prevailed. These victories led directly to last week\u2019s Judiciary Committee vote. Organizing worked. Elections mattered. Public sentiment prevailed. Democracy made a difference. This is why what happened in the House last week on guns deserved far more coverage than it got, and why Pelosi was right to use Trump\u2019s phony emergency to highlight a real one. The only cure for political cynicism is to show that the steady and painstaking work of grass-roots action can bear fruit. And the only alternative to a politics of spectacle is for elected officials and the media to lift up problems that actually need solving. Read more from E.J.

Speaking to reporters at the close of his first overseas tour since becoming Pentagon chief last month, Shanahan said the military\u2019s Joint Staff had been conducting a \u201cmission analysis\u201d on ways to deal with drugs and migrants at the border. \u201cBased on that, we can do an assessment of what would be appropriate,\u201d he said. Shanahan said the department had been preparing for weeks for a potential emergency declaration. President Trump on Friday declared a national emergency in an attempt to circumvent Congress and redirect taxpayer money to fund hundreds of miles of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. A defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning, said the military\u2019s analysis included an assessment of where border barriers would be most effective in consideration of national security. Shanahan said he had leeway to determine a final figure from available funds that would be used for border-related activities \u2014 $3.6 billion from designated military construction funds. He said service secretaries would be involved in identifying affected projects. \u201cAll of this money has been assigned for different purposes, so it comes down to: What are you going to trade off?\u201d he said. The defense official said it was likely though not certain that the Pentagon would devote the entire $3.6 billion pool of identified military construction funds to the border. Shanahan said certain projects would not be considered, including military housing. \u201cWe are following the law, using the rules,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not bending the rules.\u201d White House officials plan to use $8 billion to build fencing they say will block or discourage more immigrants. Of that money, $1.375 billion was approved by Congress on Thursday, to be allocated for 55 miles of \u201cpedestrian fencing\u201d along the border in southern Texas. The White House plans to use $600 million from the Treasury Department\u2019s forfeiture funds account, which contains money seized by the federal government from illicit activities. An additional $2.5 billion would be redirected from a Pentagon program for countering drug activity, and $3.6 billion would be moved from military construction accounts. It is the final pot of money that White House officials said required a national emergency declaration; the White House is generally barred from moving money from one account to another without congressional approval. Trump promised during the 2016 campaign that Mexico would finance a border wall. Since becoming president, however, he has insisted the money should come from U.S. taxpayers.","210":"\u201cThe bill sends your taxpayer dollars to fund political campaigns. Not to build roads or bridges but to add 600 percent of taxpayer money to every small dollar donated by Americans. So let\u2019s say Mary from Michigan donates $200 to her preferred candidate. Well, now you \u2014 the taxpayer \u2014 have just chipped in another 1,200 bucks.\u201d  \u2014 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), in a video, March 6, 2019 The House of Representatives will be voting on H.R. 1, dubbed \u201cFor the People Act of 2019,\u201d a complex, 622-page bill that aims to overhaul laws regarding voter registration, campaign finance and political ethics. For purposes of this fact check, we\u2019re going to focus on the first issue that McCarthy addresses in a video attack on the legislation. It\u2019s a point that has been echoed by other Republican lawmakers. \u201cH.R. 1 creates public subsidies for campaigns through a six-to-one taxpayer match on small-donor campaign contributions of up to $200,\u201d wrote Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), in the Hill on March 7. \u201cFor every $200, the federal government will pay $1,200 of taxpayer dollars to a congressional or presidential campaign. Meaning regardless of whether you support my bid for reelection, $1 million in public funds would have been to get me reelected last cycle had H.R. 1 been enacted.\u201d Is this really the case? Public funding of campaigns is intended to minimize the impact of big donors and super PACs, what House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), the principal sponsor of the matching provision, say is the \u201cgrievous error\u201d of Citizens United, the Supreme Court case that gave rise to super PACs. In a March 4 report explaining the bill, the House Administration Committee noted that \u201cin the 2018 midterms, only 0.47 percent of the population gave $200 or more to political campaigns,\u201d but that represented \u201c71 % of the money that went to federal candidates, PACs, parties, and outside groups.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201csmall dollar donors of $200 or less contributed only 30 percent of the money raised in the 2018 midterms.\u201d (This data is via the Center for Responsive Politics.) \u201cCandidates for office today face the difficult challenge of having to raise significant amounts of funds and to do so quickly if they want to be considered viable,\u201d the report said. \u201cFew can manage this without relying heavily on a network of donors and organized interests.\u201d The report pointed to voluntary public funding systems that it says have proved successful elsewhere, such as in New York City, where a $10 contribution from a New York City resident to a participating candidate could be worth as much as $90 to their campaign. The city matches up to $250 and most candidates participate. The result is that city candidates raise 90 percent of their money from the city\u2019s census blocs, compared to 30 percent for state assembly candidates in the same areas and which do not receive matching funds, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. The House bill would provide a 6-to-1 match for donations of $200 or less, as McCarthy and Davis said, but with significant caveats that are missing in the GOP talking points. For instance, candidates must meet a certain threshold: They must raise at least $50,000 in small-dollar contributions from at least 1,000 individuals during the qualifying period. Moreover, while individuals can currently contribute as much as $2,700 a cycle to congressional candidates, participants must agree to accept no contributions larger than $1,000. The theory is that members of Congress tend to pay more attention to individuals who hit the maximum, cycle after cycle, and a lower maximum would level the playing field. With the matching contributions, a $200 donor would have more clout than a $1,000 donor. Davis, ranking Republican on the Administration Committee, claimed that the bill, if passed into law, would add $1 million to his campaign coffers. That\u2019s apparently based on the fact he raised $183,000 from $200 and lower donations. (That\u2019s 5 percent of his total.) But he raised more than $500,000 from people who contributed $1,000 or more \u2014 money he would have to forgo if he agreed to participate in the program. Courtney Parella, a spokeswoman for Republicans on the House Administration Committee, noted that Davis would still raise $1 million from the matching funds if he qualified. Both McCarthy and Davis also claimed that the matching funds were taxpayer money. As the bill is now structured, that\u2019s not correct. The money for the matching donations would come from a 2.75 percent fee assessed on civil and criminal financial penalties with the government, which then would be earmarked for a \u201cFreedom From Influence Fund.\u201d Daniel Jacobs, a spokesman for Sarbanes, said there was no estimate for how much money this provision would raise. The Congressional Budget Office did not score the provision because the new tax on financial penalties was inserted as a manager\u2019s amendment during Rules Committee markup, after the CBO report was completed. When the CBO examined the bill, the funding supposedly was going to be determined through future legislation. \u201cExpenditures for those programs would be limited to amounts designated in the proposed Freedom From Influence Fund,\u201d the CBO wrote. \u201cThe bill would provide no source of funds for the Freedom From Influence Fund; without funding, those programs would not be implemented and thus those provisions would have no cost.\u201d \u201cFines will not be close enough to cover the 600 percent match rate,\u201d said Erin Perrine, spokeswoman for McCarthy. \u201cSince there will be an anticipated funding gap, the remaining funds for campaigns would come from general funds (also known as taxpayer dollars).\u201d The bill, however, explicitly says payments will be reduced if there is insufficient money in the fund and no money can be used from other sources: \u201cIn any case in which the Commission determines that there are insufficient moneys in the Fund to make payments to participating candidates under this title, moneys shall not be made available from any other source for the purpose of making such payments.\u201d Parella said Davis\u2019s op-ed for the Hill was written before the Rules Committee markup. She said the money still would be \u201cpublic funds.\u201d In any case, if the bill became law, a future Congress can always change how the program is funded. The current arrangement \u2014 essentially a tax on people and corporations caught in malfeasance \u2014 appears designed to avoid having the money being tagged as coming from taxpayer dollars. Other public-funding programs at the state and city level, however, are funded through general funds \u2014 and this gambit did not prevent the GOP from claiming taxpayer dollars would be used. The Fact Checker obviously takes no position on the merits of such a public-financing system. McCarthy\u2019s video attack leaves out key points, especially the fact that lawmakers would be required to stop accepting any donation over $1,000. He misleadingly suggests that every small-dollar donation would be matched, but that\u2019s only if certain thresholds are achieved. As for whether taxpayer money would be involved, that\u2019s not the current structure of the bill. So McCarthy\u2019s statement on the funding is not quite right but not totally off-base. The funding at the time of the CBO score was a blank slate, leaving the bill open to attacks on this issue. Democrats waited until after the CBO score to come up with the funding mechanism. That\u2019s often a suspicious sign.

Here\u2019s the short version: The guy who functioned as President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and fixer for a decade will allege that Trump committed crimes while in office, spewed disgusting racist comments with abandon, engaged in extensive personal and financial grift, directed subordinates to carry out his dirty work in the language of a mob boss, and was excited to hear that a hostile foreign power was sabotaging our democracy on his behalf. Let me repeat that all this is coming from Trump\u2019s own former personal lawyer and fixer. Here are four key takeaways from Cohen\u2019s testimony, which could change when he delivers it: Cohen says Trump had illicit help getting elected president, in two ways. Cohen alleges that in July of 2016, Trump held a phone call with longtime adviser Roger Stone, in which Stone informed him that a WikiLeaks dump of Hillary Clinton emails was coming, to which Trump said something like: \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be great.\u201d Remember, it was known at the time that Russian hackers were behind the WikiLeaks email dumps. Whether all this amounts to a criminal conspiracy with Russian interference (I don\u2019t expect indictments, for whatever that\u2019s worth) will be revealed soon enough by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. But this adds more grist to what we already know constitutes the big picture here: A foreign power sabotaged our democracy to help Trump get elected president, and Trump and his top advisers eagerly reaped the gains from this or, worse, actively tried to conspire with it. Separately, Cohen says he will present evidence that Trump personally reimbursed him for the hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels, which appears to constitute participation in a criminal violation of campaign finance law. Whether Trump will face legal liability for this remains to be seen \u2014 he may face indictment after leaving office. But again, this confirms the big picture: Cohen engaged in criminal activity, allegedly at Trump\u2019s direction, to help Trump defraud the voters en route to the White House, denying them information about large campaign finance expenditures designed to cover up alleged affairs. Cohen suggests Trump knew Cohen was lying to Congress on his behalf. Cohen originally pleaded guilty to lying to Congress by claiming talks over a Trump project in Moscow ended in January 2016, when in fact they continued until at least June of that year, deep into the GOP primaries. In his opening testimony, Cohen says this: You need to know that Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. We don\u2019t know which lawyers Cohen is talking about, and it\u2019s unclear how much those lawyers might have known about the Moscow project talks. But, crucially, it\u2019s hard to imagine that Trump himself was kept out of this particular loop. Indeed, Cohen addresses this point: Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress. Cohen, in effect, is saying that he understood Trump to be directing him to lie to Congress, by virtue of the fact that his personal attorneys signed off on the statement doing that. Remember, this happened in August 2017 \u2014 that is, while Trump was president. Cohen reveals how Trump gets his subordinates to do his dirty work. In his opening testimony, Cohen explains the nuances of how Trump got him to do this as follows: Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That\u2019s not how he operates. In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there\u2019s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing.\u00a0 In his way, he was telling me to lie. What\u2019s being described here is mob-boss-style communication \u2014 that is, the mode of communication adopted by someone who knows he\u2019s ordering his subordinates to falsify his conduct, but wants to preserve plausible deniability. After all, Cohen himself was not just engaged in negotiating the project; he also kept Trump apprised of it. Note, importantly, that Cohen claims Trump was more involved than we thought: There were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa Caucus in January 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me \u201cHow\u2019s it going in Russia?\u201d \u2014 referring to the Moscow Tower project. Even though they\u2019re discussing the project, Trump is also allegedly looking him in the eye and telling him that this isn\u2019t happening. If so, this was plainly intended as a command, from boss to subordinate, to lie about it. BuzzFeed\u2019s scoop about Cohen and Trump is partly vindicated. Recently, BuzzFeed reported that Cohen said Trump \u201cdirected\u201d him to lie to Congress about the Moscow project, and that Cohen told the special counsel that Trump \u201cpersonally instructed him to lie\u201d (to whom is not stated at this point in the story) to \u201cobscure Trump\u2019s involvement\u201d in it. Mueller\u2019s office issued a circumspect response to the BuzzFeed report, saying that its \u201cdescription of specific statements\u201d and characterization of \"testimony obtained by this office\u201d are \u201cnot accurate.\u201d As noted above, Cohen addresses this point by saying Trump did not directly do this, but nonetheless did so through an implicit command that he lie about the project generally, and more specifically to Congress (as Cohen understood it) through his attorneys when they signed off on his statement. This confirms important aspects of BuzzFeed\u2019s story: Cohen does suggest Trump \u201cdirected\u201d him to lie to Congress, via his implicit directive and through his attorneys. And, given that this directive really is basically a command, it\u2019s undeniable that Cohen is saying Trump generally told him to lie about the project. The murkiness of the special counsel\u2019s response leaves plenty of room for this account to be largely correct. The vagueness of all this, of course, is the whole point: The very reason for adopting the mode of communication Cohen claims Trump employed is precisely to obscure the chain of command-to-conduct. At bottom, all this adds grist to the big picture here, which is that we already know Trump engaged in extensive wrongdoing and extremely serious misconduct on multiple fronts. We\u2019re just waiting at this point to learn the full details, and whether \u2014 or, more optimistically, how \u2014 Trump will be held accountable for it. ************************************************ Update: I edited the section on the Wikileaks dump to more accurately reflect Cohen\u2019s testimony.

Hoyer said he doesn\u2019t know the contours of a potential agreement, including the amount for border barriers that have been at the heart of the stalemate between President Trump and Congress. Negotiators late Friday were closing in on a bipartisan deal that would rebuff Trump\u2019s demands for $5.7\u00a0billion for his wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Instead, lawmakers were focused on a compromise that would provide no more than $2\u00a0billion for barriers. It was unclear whether Trump would accept the compromise or follow through on his previous threats to declare a national emergency to build the wall, a move certain to face legal challenges. Lawmakers have just days to finalize legislation that can pass the House and Senate in time to get it to Trump before the Feb.\u00a015 deadline. Several agencies and departments are operating on a short-term spending bill that Trump signed Jan.\u00a025, ending the longest shutdown in history. That stopgap bill contained no money for Trump\u2019s wall. The president plans to hold a campaign rally in El Paso on Monday night that is expected to focus on the border wall that Trump repeatedly said during the 2016 campaign that Mexico would finance. Hoyer\u2019s visit was scheduled before Trump announced his rally. At a news conference after his tour, Hoyer criticized Trump\u2019s rhetoric about the border. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of debate about what we need to do on the border. There was too much hysteria about what we want to do on the border,\u201d he said. Hoyer said he hasn\u2019t heard anything from the White House on what Trump would agree to beyond his public statements that negotiators were wasting their time, although the president spoke more positively about the negotiations late in the week. Hoyer said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have committed to bring any conference committee agreement to a vote in their respective chambers. \u201cAnd I think if McConnell\u2019s going to put it on the floor, he expects it to pass. And we will certainly, I think, expect it to pass,\u201d Hoyer said in his interview with The Post. Hoyer said the funding bill should include money for aid to the Northern Triangle countries of Central America \u2014 Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador \u2014 that are the main source of a surge in family migration to the United States. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to stop them from leaving a place that they believe is a threat to themselves and their families, a mortal threat,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cAnd therefore, one of the best ways of reducing those numbers is to make it safer for them to live in their homes, where presumably they would prefer to live and where they grew up and where they know the language and they know their neighbors.\u201d Accompanying Hoyer on Saturday were Democratic Reps. Veronica Escobar of El Paso, Xochitl Torres Small and Deb Haaland of New Mexico, and Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania. All are freshmen elected in last November\u2019s Democratic wave that gave the party control of the House; Torres Small and Scanlon won seats previously held by Republicans. At one stop the delegation met a Honduran woman named Yeimi and her 3- and 5-year-old daughters, who were taken from her by Border Patrol agents when they crossed into El Paso in October. They were reunited Friday night. Her lawyer, Taylor Levy, declined to provide Yeimi\u2019s last name but said the family\u2019s story would be detailed at a news conference on Monday. The delegation also met with groups that provide legal and humanitarian aid to migrants and received a security briefing from Customs and Border Protection officials. The lawmakers said a key takeaway from their tour was that border security requires a multifaceted approach and can\u2019t be reduced to single solutions such as physical barriers. \u201cWe know that we have bad actors. We have to stop drug smugglers and human traffickers from entering our country. We also know that we need an agency that will continuously adapt to changing threats and circumstances. And that\u2019s why you have to look at the border on a mile-by-mile basis,\u201d said Torres Small, who represents a mostly rural stretch of the border across New Mexico. Escobar said that despite the ongoing surge of families from Central America seeking asylum in the United States, apprehensions of illegal border crossers remains well below numbers of a decade ago. \u201cThe challenge for me as a border resident is that the powers that be want to paint the border as insecure as a way to make this a political football, so that those who can be tougher on security emerge looking stronger in the eyes of their voters,\u201d Escobar said.","213":"A Quinnipiac University poll Tuesday carried this striking top-line number: 64 percent of Americans believe President Trump committed crimes before he became president. And 45 percent say they think he committed crimes while serving in the Oval Office. In that same poll, however, only 35 percent favor starting the impeachment process, and many more \u2014 59 percent \u2014 oppose it. In other words, there is a sizable chunk of the American electorate that thinks we have a criminal as president but would rather not entertain removing him from office. (And to be clear: The question wasn\u2019t even about removing him from office; it was about merely beginning the impeachment process.) Welcome to the Democrats\u2019 impeachment dilemma. As a number of Democratic probes of the Trump administration and Trump\u2019s personal and business dealings get off the ground, it\u2019s worth taking stock of just how high a bar the American people have \u2014 and have had \u2014 for impeachment. There is a sense among some that if Robert S. Mueller III or federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York find Trump to have committed crimes (whether a campaign finance violation, collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice), that might be the end of him. Or at least it might be the beginning of his impeachment. But that\u2019s far from a certainty. We\u2019ve seen a similar disconnect with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). Over the weekend, he said that \u201cit\u2019s very clear that the president obstructed justice.\u201d But then, in almost the same breath, he said that \u201cimpeachment\u2019s a long way down the road.\u201d So obstruction apparently isn\u2019t sufficient? The standard for impeachment, of course, isn\u2019t just any crime; it\u2019s \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d Exactly what that means is in the eye of the beholder, and it\u2019s often been said that impeachment is a political remedy to a legal issue. It\u2019s basically a standard that is decided on by the American people, as reflected by their elected members of Congress. History suggests that committing crimes \u2014 even as president, and even if they are numerous \u2014 may not be sufficient in the minds of the public. Back when Bill Clinton was impeached in the late 1990s, a Harris Poll asked whether a lie was sufficient for removing him from office, or whether he needed to have \u201ccommitted a serious criminal offense.\u201d Seventy-two percent required a \u201cserious criminal offense.\u201d A Gallup poll around the same time asked whether, if people became convinced that Clinton had obstructed justice, he should be removed from office. The public was split, with 49 percent saying that would not be sufficient. The same question was asked about Clinton lying under oath in his testimony to the grand jury. In that scenario, 50 percent favored removal, but 46 percent said it wasn\u2019t enough. In both cases, about half the country shrugged off obstruction of justice and perjury, even if they were proved. Clinton, of course, wound up being accused of both by Kenneth Starr, who listed 11 impeachable offenses in what came to be known as the Starr Report. He was impeached, but the votes in the Senate weren\u2019t there for removal. (Interestingly, polls at the time also showed people didn\u2019t want Clinton charged for perjury and obstruction even after he left office. A CBS News\/New York Times poll in December 1998 showed they preferred 54 percent to 33 percent that he not face criminal charges. A later Los Angeles Times poll showed 57 percent didn\u2019t want Starr to indict Clinton once out of office.) If there\u2019s one takeaway from that era, it\u2019s that people don\u2019t necessarily like impeachment as a remedy for even proven wrongdoing, even when it pertains to what might be actual crimes. Whether Trump will ultimately get the same treatment is unclear. There are some key differences. Chief among them is that the crimes some allege Trump to have committed pertain to his actual election and to conduct related to his official actions as president, whereas Clinton\u2019s pertained to a personal affair that many people thought wasn\u2019t the public\u2019s business. Another is that Clinton had engendered lots of goodwill with his presidency and was broadly popular, which is not something Trump has ever been able to say. It\u2019s quite possible that the impeachment bar for Trump will be lower, even if it\u2019s not registering in polls just yet. But he\u2019s also got something else around that corner that could shield him from impeachment fever, and that\u2019s the 2020 election. Voters are already hearing from Democrats eager to take Trump on, and this is all something that could ultimately just be decided by voters in 20 months\u2019 time. That might not be soon enough for Trump\u2019s most ardent critics, but it might be for those in the middle whose support would be critical for any impeachment effort. They may just reason that, however obvious Trump\u2019s crimes might be, it would be better to deal with them in an election context than a fraught impeachment proceeding. In some ways, House Democratic leaders who are wary of impeachment may just need to run the clock a little. The details matter hugely here, but the public already appears to be setting a relatively high bar for Trump\u2019s impeachment. And this poll suggests that hush-money payments and obstruction of justice may not suffice.","214":"Lawmakers are investigating whether President Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen was involved in any discussions about possible pardons \u2014 which they view as a potentially ripe area of inquiry into whether anyone sought to obstruct justice, people familiar with the matter said. Cohen has said publicly he never asked for \u2014 and would not accept \u2014 a pardon from Trump. But people familiar with the matter said his knowledge on the topic seems to extend beyond that statement. Privately, lawmakers on the House and Senate Intelligence committees pressed Cohen last week on whether he had had any discussions about a possible pardon and, if so, when and with whom those conversations took place, the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the testimony was not public. It was not immediately clear what, if anything, Cohen told lawmakers to spark their interest. Depending on the details, such pardon talks could be incendiary, suggesting an effort to dissuade \u00adCohen from cooperating with law enforcement. Cohen is to return to talk with the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday. Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Lanny Davis, declined to comment on the closed-door testimony, though he said on MSNBC on Thursday night that \u201cnew information was developed that could be game-changing,\u201d and that it was about \u201clying and obstruction evidence.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pretty explosive,\u201d he said. Cohen \u2014 who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, bank and tax fraud, and lying to Congress and was sentenced to three years in prison \u2014 is not a completely reliable narrator, and he and his allies have been known to exaggerate. Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) wrote Thursday to Attorney General William P. Barr asking him to investigate whether Cohen had perjured himself when he insisted to the House Oversight Committee he had not wanted a job in the Trump administration and was content to serve as Trump\u2019s personal attorney. That assertion has been called into question by Cohen\u2019s own public statements and White House officials. Trump tweeted after the hearing that Cohen \u201ccommitted perjury on a scale not seen before.\u201d Trump, who walked away from a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi on Thursday, tweeted on Sunday evening: \u201cFor the Democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar & fraudster, at the same time as the very important Nuclear Summit with North Korea, is perhaps a new low in American politics and may have contributed to the \u2018walk.\u2019 Never done when a president is overseas. Shame!\u201d Cohen described in testimony last week how he lied over and over for the president \u2014 even if he put himself in legal jeopardy because he sought to cover up crimes or relayed falsehoods to Congress. But he said he was no longer under the spell of the commander in chief and was ready to come clean. \u201cI am no longer your fixer, Mr. Trump,\u201d Cohen declared. As part of a broader inquiry into whether the president\u2019s campaign conspired with the Kremlin for help in the election, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has been investigating whether Trump sought to obstruct justice. Mueller\u2019s obstruction probe has focused on the firing of James B. Comey as FBI director \u2014 which Trump has said publicly he did while thinking about the Russia investigation \u2014 as well as Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on the Justice Department and then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing what would become Mueller\u2019s inquiry. Mueller is widely expected to be nearing the end of his inquiry, and Congress has been pressing to make sure the Justice Department will turn over his findings in full. Legal analysts said Cohen\u2019s testimony, while noteworthy, probably offered more new details to lawmakers and the public than it did to law enforcement. Cohen has said he would continue to cooperate with the special counsel and federal prosecutors, and he revealed during his testimony that he was in \u201cconstant\u201d contact with the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine he was saying things that suddenly comprised new information for the Southern District of New York or for Mueller to consider,\u201d said James M. Trusty, a former federal prosecutor and Justice Department organized-crime chief who is now in private practice at Ifrah Law. Cohen said notably before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday that he knew of no \u201cdirect evidence\u201d that Trump and his campaign colluded with Russia. But he alleged that the president knew before a July 2016 email dump by the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks, which obtained Democrats\u2019 emails that Mueller has alleged were hacked by Russian operatives. And Cohen said Trump vigorously urged his advisers to send the message that there had been no dealings with Russia \u2014 which could inform Mueller\u2019s obstruction case. Cohen asserted that the president and his supporters even threatened him as he prepared to testify before Congress. On the eve of his public appearance Wednesday, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) tweeted, without evidence, an allegation that Cohen had extramarital affairs. Gaetz soon deleted the message and apologized. Cohen also hinted at an investigation involving the president, asserting that federal prosecutors in Manhattan had asked him not to discuss his communication with Trump after the FBI raided his home and office in April. Asked whether there was \u201cany other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump\u201d that had not been discussed at the hearing, Cohen responded, \u201cYes, and again, those are part of the investigation that\u2019s currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York.\u201d A spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment. Perhaps most notable in the area of obstruction, Cohen said that in May 2017, he met with Trump and Jay Sekulow, one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, to discuss testimony Cohen was to give to the House Intelligence Committee. Trump, Cohen said, \u201cwanted me to cooperate.\u201d But he said Trump also repeated a refrain that is now familiar to those on Twitter. \u201cHe goes, \u2018It\u2019s all a witch hunt,\u2019 and he goes, \u2018This stuff has to end,\u2019\u200a\u201d Cohen said. \u201cDid you take those comments to be suggestive of what might flavor your testimony?\u201d Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) asked. \u201cSir, he\u2019s been saying that to me for many, many months, and at the end of the day, I knew exactly what he wanted me to say,\u201d Cohen responded. Ultimately, Cohen would testify to Congress that discussions about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow ended in January 2016 \u2014 when in fact they continued for months after that, into the heart of the presidential campaign. Cohen would later plead guilty to the lie. The topic remains of keen interest to lawmakers. Cohen conceded that Trump had not asked him to lie, but he noted that Sekulow, as well as attorney Abbe Lowell \u2014 who represents Ivanka Trump, Trump\u2019s eldest daughter, and her husband, Jared Kushner \u2014 reviewed his written testimony before it was submitted. At one point, Cohen suggested that Sekulow was involved in a change about \u201cthe length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive.\u201d And on MSNBC on Thursday night, Davis, Cohen\u2019s lawyer, said of the statement, \u201cEverybody knew it was a lie\u201d \u2014 effectively accusing Sekulow or others of knowingly passing on Cohen\u2019s false statement. But Davis corrected the statement and apologized Friday, saying he had meant to say that \u201cthe president and many of his advisers must have known\u201d Cohen\u2019s statement was false. \u201cI should not have used the words that \u2018everyone knew\u2019 the statement was false,\u201d Davis said. \u201cMy only excuse for the error is sleep deprivation. Apologies.\u201d A person familiar with Cohen\u2019s account said he cannot say with certainty whether Sekulow, Lowell or other White House advisers knew the discussions about the Trump Tower project extended well into 2016, and thus knew Cohen\u2019s statement was false. Sekulow said in a statement that Cohen\u2019s assertion that \u201cattorneys for the President edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false.\u201d A person familiar with the matter said Lowell did not edit \u00adCohen\u2019s statement but did voice a concern about the accuracy of some mention of Ivanka Trump\u2019s dealings with Russian athlete Dmitry Klokov. Cohen ultimately did not address Klokov in the statement. Lowell declined to comment. Cohen\u2019s team is working to find drafts of Cohen\u2019s statement that would reflect who edited what, and turn them over to lawmakers, people familiar with the matter said. Even that, though, may not implicate lawyers in knowingly passing along a lie \u2014 if their clients had not been truthful with them. \u201cThe greatest fear of the best lawyers is clients who do not come entirely clean with them,\u201d said Jacob Frenkel, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice at Dickinson Wright. While Cohen said Trump often talked in \u201ccode,\u201d he suggested that the president was not always subtle in directing a coverup. For example, Cohen said that at Trump\u2019s direction he paid $130,000 to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels in October 2016 so that she would stay quiet about an alleged affair with Trump, and that Trump reimbursed him for it the following year. Cohen has admitted that the payment violated campaign finance laws. Cohen said that Trump asked him to lie about the Daniels matter to Melania Trump and that he did. In 2018, when news of the payments broke, Cohen said Trump called him while he was meeting with a reporter and suggested he say the president \u201cwas not knowledgeable of these reimbursements and he wasn\u2019t knowledgeable of my actions.\u201d Cohen said that in a meeting in the Oval Office, he and the president discussed Cohen being repaid, and Cohen also said that during his presidency, Trump personally signed a check to reimburse him.","215":"Ctrl + N Facebook chief executive\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hin Washington on April 10, 2018. (Matt McClain\/The Washington Post) Mark Zuckerberg is promising a massive privacy overhaul at Facebook. But his sweeping strategy has a tradeoff: it will likely make it harder for the company to police harmful content on its platform.  Zuckerberg says Facebook's\u00a0pivot toward encrypted messaging\u00a0means that even the company will not be able to read the contents of the messages people send in its apps. That\u2019s a win for privacy advocates who want users to have greater control of their data, but it will actually limit the investments the company has made so far to detect and stamp out illegal or harmful content, ranging from child exploitation to drug sales on its platform. As Zuckerberg noted in his blog post announcing the changes, \"we will never find all of the potential harm we do today when our security systems can see the messages themselves.\u201d Critics note that could provide welcome political cover for Facebook as lawmakers around the world are considering new ways to hold the company accountable for hate and other harmful speech on their platform. Facebook has long said it wants to avoid playing the role of an online censor\u00a0-- and now it will be able to tell lawmakers it can\u2019t police what it can\u2019t see.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to argue it gives them an out,\u201d former Federal Trade Commission chief technologist Ashkan Soltani said. Facebook could be laying this groundwork because U.S. lawmakers are\u00a0stepping up their scrutiny of a decades-old communications law that gives technology platforms legal immunity for the content people post on their site, called the Communications Decency Act of 1996.\u00a0Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in October he's concerned that extremist content proliferates on social media \"in no small part\" because of the law's Section 230 provision. Trump tech adviser Gail Slater said in January policymakers should start looking at whether Congress needs to update the law.\u00a0 And the pressure on Facebook to stamp out harmful content is even greater in Europe, where the United Kingdom is considering fining technology companies for failing to remove illegal hate speech and\u00a0child exploitation.\u00a0Already in Germany, there is a law\u00a0that allows the government to fine the technology companies if they fail to remove content.\u00a0 Some tech industry watchers warned that Facebook's decision to focus on encrypted messaging could only intensify some of the issues it's already seen with its WhatsApp platform, which has already been encrypted end-to-end for years.\u00a0During the Brazil election last year, disinformation and conspiracy theories flooded the messaging platform. But Facebook couldn't use the same techniques it used to crack down on disinformation in other services because it couldn't see the messages. (The company did limit the number of times a message could be forwarded in an attempt to stop hoaxes from going viral on the service). From the Columbia Journalism Review's Mathew Ingram:\u00a0 And Techmeme\u00a0editor Spencer Dailey:\u00a0 Since the 2016 election underscored how disinformation could proliferate on social media,\u00a0Facebook's content moderation practices have been in the spotlight. The company has responded by making investments in more human content moderators and technology like artificial intelligence to police its site, but many of its decisions to remove content have proved controversial.\u00a0 But for even years before this intense\u00a0scrutiny,\u00a0Facebook has policed\u00a0its site for illegal content, particularly when it comes to child exploitation. Facebook has used photo-matching technology, which stops people from sharing known child exploitation images, and it reports them to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\u00a0 \"Stuff that's grossly illegal, Facebook has never quibbled with shutting that down,\" said former Facebook employee and \"Chaos Monkeys\" author Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez.\u00a0 Now, it will be much harder for the company to tackle that kind of content, he said. In a Twitter thread, former Facebook chief information security officer Alex Stamos noted that the losers of yesterday's announcement were groups calling for more content moderation. He also said: Zuckerberg promised that he would consult with policymakers and law enforcement about the best ways to ensure safety measures were included as the company reorients. He also said that the company was making investments to ensure it could detect bad actors on its platform, even when it can't see the contents of their activity. That could involve detecting patterns of activity or other means, he said.\u00a0 In\u00a0an interview\u00a0with Wired following the announcement,\u00a0Zuckerberg made it clear that these safety tradeoffs were the issue he was most worried about as Facebook overhauls its business model.\u00a0 \"Even though we came out on the side of prioritizing privacy in building end-to-end encryption, we're also committed to taking all of 2019 to build the safety systems to do as well as we can within the framework of an encrypted system before we roll out end-to-end encryption, which is a pretty different way from how we operated five years ago,\" Zuckerberg said in the interview.\u00a0 To be sure, as Facebook goes down this path, there will be security benefits for consumers around the world.\u00a0Zuckerberg notes in his speech that many consumers want their data to be protected this way in a world of cybersecurity threats and heavy-handed government intervention.\u00a0 \"In the last year, I've spoken with dissidents who've told me encryption is the reason they are free, or even alive,\" Zuckerberg said.\u00a0\"Governments often make unlawful demands for data, and while we push back and fight these requests in court, there's always a risk we'll lose a case -- and if the information isn't encrypted we'd either have to turn over the data or risk our employees being arrested if we failed to comply.\" At\u00a0the same time, Facebook's plans\u00a0 could also open up new battles between the company and law enforcement around the world.\u00a0Already Facebook and Apple are engaged in international regulatory battles\u00a0over encryption. And new laws in the United Kingdom and Australia make it easier for law enforcement to force the companies to hand over data.\u00a0 Several years ago, when Apple began encrypting its iPhones end-to-end, U.S. law enforcement sounded the alarm that it would make it harder to solve crimes. The debate flared when the Federal Bureau of Investigation tried to compel the company to turn over the contents of a phone in its investigation of the San Bernardino, California, attacks.\u00a0 As Facebook takes a similar stance and develops these products, Zuckerberg made it clear he's thinking about this tricky balance and seeking input.\u00a0 \"Finding the right ways to protect both privacy and safety is something societies have historically grappled with,\" he wrote.\u00a0\"There are still many open questions here and we'll consult with safety experts, law enforcement and governments on the best ways to implement safety measures.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announces the Save The Internet Act\u00a0to reinstate net neutrality\u00a0rules on Capitol Hill in Washington on March 6. (J. Scott Applewhite\/AP) BITS: House and Senate Democrat leaders unveiled legislation to reinstate Obama-era net neutrality rules that the Federal Communications Commission scrapped in a 2017 vote. The\u00a0Save the Internet Act\u00a0is a three-page bill that would reverse that 2017 decision and restore the Obama-era Internet regulations. In response to the Democratic initiative, the FCC said its repeal of the rules has \u201cproven wrong the many hysterical predictions of doom from 2017, most notably the fantasy that market-based regulation would bring about \u2018the end of the Internet as we know it,\u2019\u201d The Washington Post's Brian Fung reported. While Democrats hold a majority in the House, the legislation will likely to die in the Senate unless lawmakers from both parties can come up with a compromise,\u00a0Brian reported. Sen.\u00a0Edward J.\u00a0Markey (D-Mass.) said Republicans will be under pressure if the House overwhelmingly passes the Democratic bill, The Post's Tony Romm reported. \u201cThere are a number of Republicans who haven't yet been publicly identified who will be voting for it over on the House side,\u201d Markey said, \u201cand that will create momentum in the Senate.\u201d But Sen.

Other companies said they stopped placing\u00a0ads on the social network because they disagreed with the way it enforces its advertising policies.\u00a0 \u201cFacebook has a frankly despicable business model that's predicated on violating people's privacy and running an ad monopoly,\u201d David Heinemeier Hansson, whose software firm Basecamp quit Facebook, told CNBC. \u201cI think more people and more businesses should vote with their presence, vote with their ad dollars and consider what they want more of in this world. Our conclusion was we would like less Facebook.\u201d Even if some companies turn away from the social network, Facebook is still thriving financially. But the situation could become more problematic for the company if more consumers\u00a0decide to turn off Facebook for good.\u00a0\u201cAdvertisers may or may not leave out of principle, but they would certainly be more inclined to turn elsewhere if there's an exodus of Facebook users,\u201d according to CNBC.

The New York Times has obtained eight of the checks from Trump\u2019s accounts reimbursing hush-money payments made by Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer. The signature of Trump\u2019s eldest son is on two of them. The eight checks bolster the outlines of the story Cohen has told. He recently testified that during the campaign, Trump knowingly entered into a conspiracy with him to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels about an alleged affair, a criminal violation of campaign finance laws at Trump\u2019s direction, and then reimbursed Cohen throughout 2017, while Trump was president. Two of the checks came from a trust and thus were signed by Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg and Trump Jr. In a remarkable coincidence, the Times reports that one of the checks signed by Trump Jr. was issued on the same day that a Trump aide confirmed that the president had helped dictate a statement by Trump Jr. falsifying the rationale behind the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting. At that meeting Trump Jr. eagerly tried to conspire with Russia to corrupt our election on his father\u2019s behalf. That confluence of events neatly captures the seamy role that Trump Jr. has played throughout this whole affair, on multiple fronts. Trump Jr.\u2019s legal exposure remains unclear Legal experts I spoke with say the significance of Trump Jr.\u2019s involvement in the hush-money scheme remains uncertain. One question is whether Trump Jr. was involved in the original conspiracy in the fall of 2016 to pay the hush money and whether he understood the payments as campaign expenditures. Cohen has declared that Trump fully understood these payments in these terms, and prosecutors have charged that Cohen carried them out at Trump\u2019s \u201cdirection,\u201d violating campaign finance laws, which is why Trump may end up getting charged after he leaves office. But what about Trump Jr.? Bob Bauer, the White House counsel under President Barack Obama, points out that Trump Jr. was a senior campaign official and may have been involved in discussions over the need to keep affairs alleged by Daniels and Karen McDougal under wraps for campaign purposes. Indeed, prosecutors have charged that Cohen \u201ccoordinated\u201d these actions with \u201cone or more members of the campaign.\u201d \u201cIf Trump Jr. was acting on behalf of the campaign and involved in the conversation about the importance to the campaign of keeping this quiet, then he\u2019s in the circle of co-conspirators,\u201d Bauer told me, though he repeatedly stressed that we know very little about what happened. Then there\u2019s the question of what Trump Jr. knew about the original payments when he signed the checks in 2017 reimbursing them. \u201cIf he was aware of the purpose of the payments, then I think he could be on the hook for conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws,\u201d former U.S. attorney Barbara McQuade told me. McQuade added that in this scenario, Trump Jr. would know that he and his father need to reimburse the payments in \u201cinstallments, so as not to draw attention\u201d to the payments and their original purpose of avoiding damage to the campaign. The question, McQuade said, is whether Trump Jr. \u201cknew that was the scheme.\u201d He may have just signed the checks without a full sense of why Cohen was getting reimbursed. \u201cIt really comes down to his knowledge and intent,\u201d McQuade noted, adding that Weisselberg (who was granted limited immunity to testify about the payments) might shed light on that. If Trump Jr. does have exposure, then the question would be why prosecutors haven\u2019t charged him yet. \u201cIt may be that they\u2019re not done investigating or are looking for additional participants,\u201d McQuade said. \u201cIt may be that they have other crimes or defendants they\u2019re thinking of including.\u201d Or it may be nothing. Trump Jr.\u2019s role in Russiagate remains cloudy Cohen testified that reports of the Trump Tower meeting with the Russians spurred him to remember an episode in which Trump Jr. may have told his father about the meeting in advance. We have no idea whether this is true. But former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon has said: \u201cThe chance that Don. Jr. did not walk these Jumos up to his father\u2019s office on the 26th floor is zero.\u201d Here\u2019s what we do know: Trump Jr.\u2019s own emails show that he eagerly wanted to conspire with a foreign power\u2019s efforts to sabotage U.S. democracy, and he followed up by holding a meeting in pursuit of that end in his father\u2019s signature skyscraper. He and his father subsequently issued a statement lying to America to cover this up. It\u2019s fitting, in a way, that this act was confirmed on the date that one of these checks was issued. Because the bottom line on all this is that Trump had illicit help in getting elected president in two ways \u2014 from both the criminal scheme Cohen carried out, allegedly at Trump\u2019s direction, and from Russia\u2019s wide-ranging plot to corrupt our democracy, on Trump\u2019s behalf. And Trump Jr. had at least some involvement, however limited, in both. Even if not a single additional criminal charge is brought, all of that will remain true. There is probably no one in Trump\u2019s orbit who spends more time aggressively taunting the president\u2019s critics and pursuers than Trump Jr. does. In so doing, he often seems to be daring the fates to come at him with a brash confidence that he will skirt any consequences, even as emerging facts seem to implicate him ever more deeply in multiple aspects of his father\u2019s wrongdoing and alleged criminality. Whether that confidence amounts to hubris that will ultimately bring him down remains to be seen.

Jones Jr., a North Carolina congressman who so enthusiastically supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq that he argued for the french fries and French toast served in House cafeterias to be called \u201cfreedom fries\u201d and \u201cfreedom toast\u201d \u2014 a jab at France for its opposition to the war \u2014 but who later underwent a dramatic change of heart and emerged as a prominent Republican critic of the war, died Feb. 10, on his 76th birthday. His office confirmed the death in a statement. It had announced Jan. 26 that the 13-term lawmaker had entered hospice care, his health having declined after a fall in which he broke his hip. Rep. Jones had been granted a leave of absence in late 2018 for an unspecified illness. Rep. Jones first ran for Congress in 1992, campaigning unsuccessfully as a conservative Democrat for the northeastern North Carolina district that his father had represented for 26 years. A Southern Baptist from childhood, Rep. Jones had converted to Catholicism in his early 30s and cited his opposition to abortion among the factors that led to his disenchantment with his family\u2019s longtime political party. Two years later, amid the \u201cRepublican revolution\u201d that swept the House, he joined the GOP and won a seat in a neighboring district that now includes the Marine Corps\u2019 Camp Lejeune and Cherry Point air station. During his early tenure on Capitol Hill, he was a reliable Republican vote and, in 2002, joined most Republicans and many Democrats in voting for a resolution authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force in Iraq after Bush accused Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein of hiding weapons of mass destruction. Russia and France threatened to veto a U.N. resolution authorizing the war, but the French were the most vocal in their opposition. In response, Rep. Jones and Rep. Robert W. Ney (R-Ohio) led a successful campaign to oust the word \u201cFrench\u201d from House cafeteria items. They were acting in an American tradition that dated at least to World War I, when sauerkraut was re-christened \u201cliberty cabbage.\u201d Rep. Jones called his effort a response to France\u2019s \u201cself-serving politics of passive aggression,\u201d while liberals lampooned it as knee-jerk jingoism. The U.S.-led invasion began in March 2003 and has resulted in more than 4,000 U.S. deaths and more than 100,000 Iraqi casualties. No weapons of mass destruction were found, and the justification for the invasion was soon revealed to have been based on faulty information. (\u201cThe people around Bush manipulated the intelligence,\u201d Rep. Jones later said.) Rep. Jones, who came to deeply regret his championing of the war, traced his transformation to a funeral held at Camp Lejeune for a 31-year-old Marine sergeant and amphibious assault vehicle driver who had been killed in March 2003 while helping evacuate wounded comrades. In the presence of their three young children, including newborn twins, his widow read from the man\u2019s final letter home. \u201cI had tears running from my eyes,\u201d the congressman told Mother Jones magazine. He watched as the older boy dropped a toy and a Marine picked it up and handed it back. \u201cAnd the boy looked up at him,\u201d the congressman said, \u201cand the Marine looked down, and then it hit me: This little boy would never know his daddy.\u201d \u201cThis was a spiritual happening for me,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cI think at that point I fully understood the loss that a family feels.\u201d He added of his drive home: \u201cThe whole way, 72 miles, I was thinking about what I just witnessed. I think God intended for me to be there.\u201d He began writing to relatives of every U.S. service member killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, one wrenching letter at a time. \u201cI have signed over 12,000 letters to families and extended families who\u2019ve lost loved ones in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and that was for me asking God to forgive me for my mistake,\u201d Rep. Jones told NPR in 2017. He also hung posters displaying the faces of the war dead along the hallway leading to his office on Capitol Hill. In 2005, Rep. Jones publicly renounced his vote and called on Bush to set a timeline for withdrawal from Iraq. He became a scathing critic of U.S. military action under Republican and Democratic presidents. But he held Bush\u2019s vice president, Richard B. Cheney, in particular contempt for his role advocating for the Iraq invasion. \u201cLyndon Johnson\u2019s probably rotting in hell right now because of the Vietnam War, and he probably needs to move over for Dick Cheney,\u201d Rep. Jones said in 2013 during remarks at a meeting of the libertarian group Young Americans for Liberty in Raleigh, N.C. While Rep. Jones held fast to core Republican tenets including opposition to abortion rights, on other issues he found himself a lonely voice within the GOP. He backed campaign finance reform and increasing the minimum wage. He twice opposed his party\u2019s leader, Rep. John A. Boehner of Ohio, for House speaker. And he voted against President Trump\u2019s signature tax bill in 2017 in part because it increased the deficit. In 2012, responding to his rebellious streak, GOP leaders moved to strip him of his position on the Financial Services Committee. But while some considered him a gadfly, others viewed him as a principled legislator \u2014 including many of his constituents, who continually returned him to office. \u201cWhat Jones showed is that you can be a very conservative guy, you can be a libertarian, but you can find all kinds of ways to work with members from across the aisle,\u201d said Norman J. Ornstein, an American Enterprise Institute congressional scholar. \u201cBeing conservative doesn\u2019t mean you need to march in lock-step.\u201d \u201cMaybe you\u2019re shut out of power because you don\u2019t conform, but you get recognized the right way,\u201d Ornstein added. Walter Beaman Jones Jr. was born in Farmville, N.C., on Feb.\u00a010, 1943. He graduated in 1961 from Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Va., where he was a star basketball player, and in 1966 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in history from Atlantic Christian College (now Barton College) in Wilson, N.C. After service in the North Carolina National Guard, he worked as a wine broker with a territory that included North Carolina and Virginia. Because of his political connections, he was approached in 1982 by a local Democratic Party official to complete the term of a state representative who had died in office. He remained in the state House until 1992. In 1966, he married Joe Anne Whitehurst. In addition to his wife, survivors include a daughter, Ashley. In explaining one of his votes against his party \u2014 his opposition to the sweeping GOP tax overhaul in 2017 \u2014 Rep. Jones told The Washington Post that he believed the measure would not help the middle class, describing his decision as a matter of conscience. \u201cYou always run concerned .\u2009.\u2009. I don\u2019t take [the seat] for granted,\u201d Rep. Jones said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anyone can question my integrity.\u201d Read more Washington Post obituaries  Edward F.

Donna Shalala\u2019s Longworth office is the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 the powerful agency she ran for all eight years of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. The Florida Democrat is the first person to join Congress after serving as an HHS secretary (President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first HHS head, Richard Schweiker, and President Trump\u2019s first HHS\u00a0chief, Tom Price, both held congressional seats before their agency appointments). \u201cI may be a freshman, but I\u2019m not a rookie,\u201d Shalala likes to tell constituents and House colleagues. She\u2019s not on the Ways and Means Committee or on Energy and Commerce, the House\u2019s two top health-care panels. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has appointed Shalala to the Rules Committee, a perch allowing her to showcase her deep policy knowledge. Last month Shalala managed debate on a bill that would have required the House\u2019s chief lawyer to defend the Affordable Care Act against a lawsuit from GOP-led states. I recently sat down with Shalala\u00a0to get her thoughts on Medicare-for-all, Obamacare, the Trump administration\u2019s drug pricing efforts and more. Shalala said she wants to reach universal coverage not with a whole overhaul of the system but through\u00a0incremental steps,\u00a0argued that Medicaid might be a better vehicle than Medicare for doing that and expressed optimism there will be bipartisan work to bring down drug costs. Here\u2019s our conversation, with some edits for clarity and brevity. Health 202: You have such an interesting perspective as former secretary. What do you hope to accomplish overall now that you\u2019re in Congress? Shalala: I want to improve people's lives. I know lots of people that can't afford health insurance. We've got to figure out a way to get everybody covered and we've got to use, in my judgment, existing vehicles to do that. We have these platforms: Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, the Children's Health Insurance Plan \u2014\u00a0that's number one. Number two, we have to get integrated care. It's much too fragmented. I ran academic health centers. Oh, my God. You have a doctor for every part of your body, but they don't necessarily work seamlessly together. Most of our costs are in chronic care. So we have to figure out ways to manage that within the health-care system and we have to do it efficiently and effectively. We have to take on prescription drugs and we got to do it without gimmicks like importation. Health 202: You\u2019ve noted your district has more individual insurance marketplace enrollees than any other district in the country.\u00a0Are you hoping to make any improvements to the ACA? Shalala: We would very much like to make some improvements in the ACA. I was always worried the subsidies weren't deep enough. Because you're basically capturing a group of people who had lousy health insurance or didn't have any health insurance, who don't get big increases in their pay. I've always felt that we have to go deeper into the middle class with subsidies. I also am no fan of high deductibles, even if the primary care is free. We just saw during this shutdown that most people can't even come up with four hundred dollars. Health 202: So what can be done about the high deductibles we\u2019ve seen in the marketplace plans? Shalala: Congress would have to provide subsidies and close some doughnut holes. A deductible is basically a doughnut hole. I would be particularly interested in [deductible] subsidies for people that have slightly higher income because I think that they're the people that are really having a challenge. I also would do some other things. Let people buy into the Medicare program at 55. We proposed that at the end of the Clinton administration. We didn't get anyplace with it, but we'd figured out a way that you could do it without it costing the trust fund any money \u2014 by just charging people a little more \u2026 to get into it early. I would argue that an early buy-in might help us reduce the need for high-risk pools. So I'm always looking for simpler ways on existing platforms as opposed to inventing something new to help us get to universal coverage and affordability. Rep. Donna Shalala (D-Fla.) speaks at a Post Live event.\u00a0(Photo by Kristoffer Tripplaar\/For The Washington Post) Health 202: How are you feeling about the Obamacare marketplaces as they stand now? Because as you know we did see average premiums go down this year. Shalala: Well, it's interesting. We had high enrollments in Florida. The places where we struggled with marketplace is the more rural areas, the smaller towns, the places where it's hard to get the kind of volume that you need. Some insurers pulled out but it was because they didn't get big enough market share. So in densely urban areas it worked best, particularly if you get the kind of patient mix you know you wanted to get. But in Florida it's an interesting phenomenon. We got huge enrollments because we have no big industries that can easily accommodate a large percentage of the population [with employer-sponsored coverage]. People said to me,\u00a0\u2018You have all those enrollments in south Florida Cuban clinics.\u2019 You have a set of clinics basically with Latin American doctors in South Florida. Many of them Cuban. And you have hospitals that had large, large numbers of low-paying patients and everybody had an economic incentive to sign people up. Health 202: The absence of the individual mandate penalty seems to have had less impact than expected. What do you think? Shalala: I would love to have the mandate back. But I wouldn't put the mandate back without doing some of these other things to make [insurance] more affordable and more attractive and easier. But I do think whatever we do, our goal ought to be universal coverage \u2014 affordable, high-quality universal coverage. Health 202: Do you think that we're going to get to a point eventually where Republicans embrace or at least accept the fact that the ACA is here? Shalala: I think we'll get to a place where we'll get some Republican votes \u2014 depending on where they're from \u2014 for bipartisan fixes. For instance, my predecessor Ileana Ros-Lehtinen supported the ACA because of the number of people in our district. The other thing I would do that I don't think anyone be interested in: I would raise [those who can stay on their parents' insurance plans from]\u00a026-year-olds to 30 [year-olds]. And the reason I do that is because they don't want to buy insurance. A lot of them are stuck in graduate school or in the gig economy, and their parents would be perfectly willing to cover them and it wouldn't show up on their parents\u2019 employer's health insurance because they're healthy. I know what young people's lives are like because I've run universities. I know how long they are outside of the regular market. So I think if you did that and let people buy into Medicare or Medicaid \u2014 because Medicaid is far more comprehensive than Medicare is. I've talked to a lot of people that support Medicare-for-all. I said I wanted to do Medicaid for all. That's a better program. It's got long- term care. And they said, \u2018Well, we can fix Medicare\u2019 .\u2009.\u2009. very expensive to fix. Health 202: Why have Democrats focused so much on Medicare-for-all versus Medicaid? Shalala: Medicare has never been associated with welfare, with poor people. Medicaid has, that's number one. Number two: We\u2019re at the Capitol. We're at the federal government. That's a Medicare program, not a Medicaid program. Just a handful of experts on Medicaid are in Congress and most of them have retired. Health 202: Tell me how you feel about Medicare-for-all. Shalala: They're going to have hearings. I don't know where to go because many people believe the people who have very good health insurance ought to be able to keep it because they have better health insurance than Medicare currently has. The other thing is that I've said to people if you look at the Kaiser polls, Medicare-for-all falls apart once you start telling people what it will cost [and] that they'll have to give up their existing health insurance. I debated my opponents on Medicare-for-all. I had four or five opponents to my left. They were all for Medicare-for-all. I said, \u2018Look, I'd like to expand access to Medicare,\u2019 but we were at a labor union. I said, \u2018Every person in this union has better health insurance then Medicare, so tell them that they have to give up their health insurance.\u2019\u00a0 Health 202: We know how well it worked for Obama when he promised \u2018If you like it, you can keep it\u2019 and then some people lost their plans. That's really potent. Shalala: Absolutely. The principle is universal health care. Medicare-for-all is one way to get there. My preference is to be very pragmatic and fill in the gaps. But I also want to move towards integrated care. And that is the fragmentation of the health-care system that drives everybody crazy. You go for an operation and here's what you ask: Does my insurance cover this? And the answer is yes. And then afterwards you find out the anesthesiologist was out of network and you say what does that mean. Who asks whether everybody is in network that's in your operating room? You don't even know who your anesthesiologist is. You have no personal relationship with your anesthesiologist. Health 202: Let\u2019s return to Medicare for a minute. What do you think needs to be fixed in that program? Shalala:\u00a0We haven't completely closed the doughnut hole in terms of drugs. There's bipartisan support to do that. My mother and aunts used to yell at me about that doughnut hole \u2014 why did we do a doughnut hole? And I'd say, \u2018Well, it was a budget decision \u2026 they didn't have enough money so they left a hole in the middle.\u2019 And they thought that was the stupidest explanation. I mean how do you explain it to someone that's 92? My aunt said to me, 'But I pay my taxes.\u2019 (laughter) Health 202: They\u2019re in blissful ignorance of how Congress works, I guess. Shalala: I remember going home that Christmas after [Congress passed the] Medicare Part D [prescription drug benefit].\u00a0 And my mother said, \u2018You know, you're going to have two mornings where you're really tied up.\u2019 She said all of our relatives are coming over for you to sign them up for Part D cause they're totally confused about it. I literally sat on a computer and signed 14 people up for Part D. And she said, \u2018You were the secretary of Health and Human Services. You know how to do this.\u2019 I had no idea. Health 202:\u00a0Where do you stand on allowing the government to negotiate lower Part D prices directly with drugmakers? Shalala: My view is the secretary ought to have the power to negotiate in the same way that the secretary of Veterans Affairs or a state Medicaid director can. Health 202: That sounds like pretty much a nonstarter with Republicans in the Senate. Shalala: Well, we'll see. Unless you have volume you can't bring down the cost. There are no tricks to this. Now, we could do something simple. We could adopt the formulary the VA uses. I mean, if you didn't want to let them negotiate, take existing negotiations. Health 202: What do you think of HHS Secretary Alex\u00a0Azar\u2019s moves on prescription drug prices? Shalala: I can't tell yet. He is very knowledgeable. Someone just asked me whether I thought the administration was going to [push for a bill allowing] negotiation on prescription drugs. I said look, if they use Azar to negotiate a bill he's at least knowledgeable. The question is how much direction does he get from [Office of Management and Budget] and the White House on it? He's very sophisticated. He understands the pricing issues. He knows as well as anyone that you're only going to get discounts if you get volume. Look at what we did on AIDS drugs. I worked at the Clinton Foundation for a year. President Clinton negotiated with the pharmaceuticals and promised them millions of people for a highly discounted series of AIDS drugs. So you've got to negotiate out on the basis of large numbers of people to get your costs down. Health 202: And Azar\u2019s Medicare Part B demonstration would involve\u00a0a pretty small share of Medicare drug spending. Shalala: Yeah. We don't have to demonstrate it. We know something about markets. Health 202: So you'd like to go bigger and bolder, essentially. Shalala: Absolutely. Whether you can sell that politically \u2026[but] we also have to be respectful of the research dimension of the pharmaceuticals. I do not want to destroy the industry in the process because they\u2019ve got a pipeline that's important to\u00a0everyone in this country, in the world. But I'm not anxious to pay for their \u2018D.\u2019 I'm happy to pay for their \u2018R.\u2019 The rest of the world, it's been cost shifting onto us, as the president has pointed out and as the rest of us have pointed out over the years. The rest of the world \u2026 they are negotiating on the basis of volume and they're getting lower prices and not paying for the \u2018R\u2019 part. American taxpayers are paying for the research part. Health 202: Do you think there's going to be bipartisan work on health policy in the next two years? Shalala: I hope so. We'll see. We'll see what they bite on to. I don't know. I do know that we've got some ideas and I've talked a little bit to the committee people, but I've really got to have longer conversations. I want to be very careful because all this stuff has to have hearings, it has to go through the committees. I have had a lot of experience. I've sat on the corporate boards of health-care companies. I've run hospitals and big health-care systems and I've obviously been secretary, but my best experience has been talking to people and seeing what's bothering them. Out-of-pocket costs, I think, are a big issue with people. We've got to figure out a way to get our arms around that issue. These are bread- and-butter issues, but they're also issues for companies because the companies are going crazy because they don't know what their health-care costs are going to be next year. So there are a lot of interests in containing costs. Health 202: It\u2019s certainly something both parties are talking about. Shalala: If you see the look on the face of home health-care workers who got Obamacare for the first time in their lives and got free primary care the first time they ever went to the doctor, boy, you want to extend this to everybody. I hope we can find some incentives to get more governors, including mine, into expanding Medicaid because a lot of Republican governors have done it \u2014 they've done it under waivers. I give a final exam in which I ask the students to make one recommendation to the president of the United States to improve the health-care system for everybody. The kid that got the A-plus said campaign finance reform. Not bad. He was scared to death that I'd flunk him but it's a smart answer. Because around each of these changes there's an array of interest groups. AHH: After a nearly four-hour\u00a0physical exam with 11 specialists, President Trump\u2019s doctors said he is in \u201cvery good health\u201d and is expected to stay healthy for \u201cthe duration of his Presidency, and beyond,\u201d our Post colleague Anne Gearan writes. No details of the Friday\u00a0exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center were released, nor was it clear if more details would later be publicized. \u201cThe memo did not include the disciplines of any of the specialists,\u201d Anne writes. \u201cTypically, a physical exam includes checks of height, weight, blood pressure and other standard measures. Trump said last year that he takes a statin drug to manage his cholesterol.\u201d The president has \u201cvisibly gained weight in recent years,\u201d Anne adds.

Michael Bennet, the Colorado Democrat considering a 2020 presidential run, criticized calls by some Democrats to\u00a0eliminate private insurance in pursuing Medicare-for-all. \u201cRemember when President Obama said, 'If you like your insurance, you can keep your insurance,'\" Bennet said during an interview on NBC's \u201cMeet to Press. \u201cAnd then a few people in America actually lost their insurance because of the way that the plan worked. Now what Democrats are saying is, 'If you like your insurance, we're going to take it away from you,' from 180 million people that get their insurance from their employer and like it, where 20 million Americans who are on Medicare Advantage, and love it. That seems like a bad opening offer for me.\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) raised eyebrows\u00a0last month when she said during a CNN town hall she\u2019d like\u00a0to get rid of private health insurance. \u201cThe idea is that everyone gets access to medical care and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through all the paperwork, all of the delay that may require,\u201d Harris said.\u00a0 OUCH: While Washington state\u2019s worst measles outbreak in two decades continues, hundreds of people packed into a public hearing about\u00a0a bill to make it more difficult for families to opt out of vaccination requirements for measles, mumps and rubella. Most of the 700 or so people at\u00a0the Friday meeting were opposed to stricter standards, our Post colleagues Lena H. Sun and Kristen Millares Young report. At the hearing, Washington state Health Secretary John Wiesman urged state lawmakers to pass the bill and debunked\u00a0claims from some in attendance that\u00a0vaccines are dangerous. \u201cI want to remind you that the MMR vaccine is extremely safe and highly effective,\u201d Wiesman told lawmakers. He added \u201call reputable scientific studies have found no relation between measles and autism.\u201d The bill would eliminate personal or philosophical exemptions to obtaining the vaccine -- but would\u00a0still allow for medical and religious exemptions, Lena and Kristen report. The bill's sponsor, state Rep. Paul Harris (R), represents Clark County, the epicenter of the measles outbreak, and is planning to amend the bill to \"tighten religious exemptions, too,\"\u00a0they write. \u201cWashington is one of 17 states that allow personal or philosophic exemptions to vaccination requirements, meaning virtually anyone can opt out,\u201d they add. But the recent nationwide outbreaks\u00a0have prompted lawmakers in Washington and several states to consider tightening immunization standards. \u2014 Meanwhile, some teens are fact-checking their families\u2019 antivaccination stances and seeking their own treatment, our Post colleague Alex Horton writes.\u00a0 \u201cIn three states, at least three self-described teenagers told Reddit they have a common problem: Their parents are staunchly opposed to vaccination, and they fear for their health if they do not take action,\u201d he writes. \u201cDifferent state laws affect how old minors need to be to make their own medical decisions.\u201d An 18-year-old Ethan Lindenberger from Ogio explained he read scientific studies, including from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and tried to persuade his mother to let him and his four younger siblings get vaccinated. \u201cI looked into it, it was clear there was way more evidence in defense of vaccines,\u201d he told The Post. But his mother resisted.\u00a0 \u201cOn Dec. 17, he walked into an Ohio Department of Heath office in Norwalk and received a cocktail of vaccines for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza and HPV, according to a shot record viewed by The Post,\u201d Alex writes. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.). (Kristoffer Tripplaar\/For The Washington Post) \u2014 Republican lawmakers are itching for hearings on Democrats\u2019 Medicare-for-all proposals, hoping such public airings\u00a0will give them a chance to home in on an opposing message leading up to 2020 elections, Politico\u2019s Alice Miranda Ollstein reports. \u201cWe should have the opportunity to have a hearing on a bill Democrats say they are for,\u201d the House Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s top Republican Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) said. \u201cThey\u2019ve campaigned on it. Now, let\u2019s find out what it is and what they\u2019re promoting.\u201d Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, said lawmakers want to \u201cpull the curtain back on Medicare for All so the American people can actually assess it.\u201d Meanwhile, Democrats are embracing these calls. \u201cThey think it\u2019s going to be a \u2018gotcha\u2019 moment,\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), lead author of a Medicare-for-all bill. \u201cBut they have been wrong on this and continue to be wrong on it.\u201d \u201cThe Republicans\u2019 counterintuitive move seeks to exacerbate real divisions within the Democratic Party on how far and how fast to move beyond Obamacare and chart a course toward Medicare for All,\u201d Alice writes. \u201cSenior Democrats leading the House's health committees blasted the GOP request as \u2018cynical\u2019 and \u2018disingenuous\u2019 and said it would not affect their timeline for weighing the policy.\u201d Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). (Alex Wong\/Getty Images) \u2014 Democrats and liberal groups are targeting Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) for her support of Brett M. Kavanaugh after the newest addition to the Supreme Court dissented in a 5-to-4 vote to block a restrictive Louisiana abortion law. They\u2019re pointing to the dissent as a sign the newest justice\u00a0would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade and side with conservatives in future abortion-rights related cases, our Post colleagues Felicia Sonmez and Michael Scherer report. Demand Justice, a liberal group that opposed Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, is planning a more than $10,000 digital ad campaign in Maine to \u201cinform voters of how Collins\u2019 vote for Kavanaugh helped lead to the close call in Thursday\u2019s ruling,\u201d Felicia and Michael report. \u201cDemocrats are particularly incensed at Collins, who delivered a 44-minute-long floor speech in October declaring her support for Kavanaugh,\u201d they write. \u201cAt the time, Collins, who supports abortion rights, said she did not think Kavanaugh would vote to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.\u201d Annie Clark, communications director for Collins, countered by referring to Kavanaugh\u2019s December vote in Planned Parenthood\u2019s favor.\u00a0\u201cDuring his confirmation process, Planned Parenthood was Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s number one opponent,\u201d Clark said in a statement. \u201cThey went after him with everything that they had. And yet, when it came to a case involving them, he was able to put that aside and rule impartially and independently.\u201d \u2014 HHS\u00a0is seeking the authority to reverse an Obama-era policy that barred foster care\u00a0and adoption agencies from rejecting prospective parents based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.\u00a0HHS\u2019s Office of Civil Rights argues in a 2020 draft budget request\u00a0that some of the country\u2019s oldest religious agencies in places such as Boston, Philadelphia and Washington have gone out of business because of nondiscrimination requirements that are themselves discriminatory. President Trump pointed to such a move at the National Prayer Breakfast last week, our Post colleague Ariana Eunjung Cha reports, telling\u00a0religious leaders that such faith-based agencies would still be able to get federal funding to \u201chelp vulnerable children find their forever families while following their deeply held beliefs.\u201d \"Faith-based agencies play an important role in foster care and adoption in the United States, and in some parts of the country are the dominant providers,\" Ariana writes. \"Religious leaders say that HHS\u2019s requested changes would not prevent qualified individuals from becoming adoptive and foster parents because there are many other agencies that will accept them.\" It\u2019s the latest move from an administration that has sought to protect\u00a0religious groups that\u00a0are key supporters of the president.\u00a0\u201cHHS specifically takes issue with the idea that an Obama-era rule barring discrimination on the basis of religion, sexual orientation or gender identity might force religious-based groups to have to place children in family arrangements inconsistent with their belief that marriage is the union of one man and one woman,\" Ariana writes. Currey Cook, an attorney with Lambda Legal, which advocates for LGBTQ communities, said \u201cNo one in this is saying faith-based providers don\u2019t have a place in the child welfare system. It\u2019s great they are a part of it. What we are saying is that if you are accepting government funds and performing a government service, you should not be able to discriminate against people with those dollars.\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) has officially entered the 2020 race:\u00a0","220":"THE LIGHTBULB President Donald\u00a0Trump, in front of Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,\u00a0during his State of the Union address. (Toni L. Sandys\/The Washington Post) President Trump hammered home a message of economic prosperity during his State of the Union address. As Trump told it, the economy is soaring, fewer Americans are on food stamps and unemployment is at an all-time low.\u00a0 A big part\u00a0of that economic growth,\u00a0as Trump describes it,\u00a0is a \"revolution in American energy.\"\u00a0 \"The United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world,\" Trump told Congress last night. \"And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.\" And what about coal? Trump didn't mention it once during his address. What was once one of Trump's favorite talking points as a\u00a0candidate \u2014 \"beautiful, clean coal,\" as Trump repeatedly said during the 2016 campaign \u2014 was entirely absent from his speech Tuesday night. Gone were lines\u00a0about his effort to end the \"war\" on coal the Obama administration waged that were in\u00a0his 2018 address to Congress. The omission is perhaps a small\u00a0indication of the large\u00a0difficulty the Trump administration has had trying to revive the struggling\u00a0U.S. coal sector. The Energy Department's plan to subsidize hurting coal\u00a0plants at the behest of Trump campaign booster and coal baron Robert Murray never got off the ground. Despite the\u00a0rollback of some air-pollution rules extending the\u00a0life of some coal facilities, the closure\u00a0of coal plants nationwide\u00a0has continued apace during Trump's presidency \u2014 with\u00a016 gigawatts of\u00a0coal-fired power going offline in\u00a02018, according to\u00a0Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Cheaper forms of electricity generation that include natural gas, solar and wind energy are replacing coal. The result is that total coal consumption last year\u00a0in the United States was projected to plunge\u00a0to\u00a0its lowest level in 40 years. That shift from coal to natural gas is even happening in the heart of historic coal country.\u00a0Joe Manchin III of\u00a0West Virginia\u00a0appeared to be one of the only, if not the only, Democrat who stood and clapped\u00a0when Trump boasted\u00a0about booming gas production. Indeed, Trump correctly stated that the United States is the top oil and gas producer\u00a0globally \u2014 though that has been true since 2012. The boom has more to do with the development of new extraction technologies, like hydraulic fracturing, than it has to do with any more recent Trump administration policy. And the\u00a0president spoke too soon when claiming the\u00a0nation is already a net energy exporter, though he still captured the general industry\u00a0trend.\u00a0 The\u00a0Energy Information Administration, an independent agency in the Energy Department,\u00a0said just last week that the United States will\u00a0reach that status in 2020 for the first time in nearly seven decades. So\u00a0that means that\u00a0at the moment, the United States still imports more energy than it sends aboard. Oil and gas industry representatives praised the president's speech while\u00a0attempting\u00a0to tie Trump's push for an infrastructure bill in Congress to easing\u00a0the\u00a0permitting process for new pipelines. \"Expanding natural gas infrastructure is essential to improving our environment and growing our economy,\" said Don Santa, president and chief executive of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. Liberal advocacy groups, meanwhile, bemoaned Trump's\u00a0failure to address climate change at all during his speech. \"Trump tried to erase climate change from tonight\u2019s State of the Union, but you can\u2019t erase a global crisis,\" Greenpeace USA chief Annie Leonard said. \"Bragging about oil and gas production when global scientists are basically shouting from the rooftops to stop drilling and stop fracking is denial at its most dangerous level.\" Stacey Abrams (Pool video image via AP) \u2014 \"We can no longer ignore these threats to democracy\": Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams gave the official Democratic response to Trump's speech. In it, she\u00a0tried to tie legistative action on climate change to the issue she is perhaps best known for: voting rights and registration.\u00a0\"We can do so much more,\" she said. \"Take action on climate change. Defend individual liberties with fair-minded judges. But none of these ambitions are possible without the bedrock guarantee of our right to vote.\" Compare to last year:\u00a0Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) got some serious flack from liberal activists for\u00a0failing to mention climate change during his official State of the Union rebuttal\u00a0in 2018. Rick Perry (Kevin Dietsch\/EPA-EFE\/REX\/Shutterstock) \u2014 Rick\u00a0Perry was the \u201cdesignated survivor\u201d: The nation's energy secretary was sequestered in a secret location during Tuesday\u2019s address, picked as the official who would take over as president if catastrophe struck on Capitol Hill, The Post\u2019s Seung Min Kim reports. He was one of only a\u00a0few options: The designated survivor is meant to be someone in a Senate-confirmed position, eliminating many of the Cabinet officials currently in acting roles. The president\u2019s Cabinet currently includes an acting attorney general, acting secretaries of Defense and Interior, an acting EPA administrator, an acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, as well as an acting White House chief of staff. But energy secretaries often draw the short straw: The Obama administration tapped its energy secretaries three times \u2014 in 2009, 2013 and 2014 \u2014 to be the designated survivor during joint sessions of Congress. \u2014\u00a0Wheeler gets\u00a0committee nod:\u00a0The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee voted\u00a0to move the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to be Environmental Protection Agency administrator\u00a0to the full Senate. The vote was\u00a011 to 10 along\u00a0party lines, with Sen.\u00a0Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) giving Wheeler the greenlight after urging the agency recently to develop drinking-water standards for a class of toxic chemicals that have polluted some West Virginia communities. \u2014 The EPA\u00a0goes after news organizations again:\u00a0After a series of news stories last week, Wheeler's\u00a0EPA \u201cfound cause to play media critic,\u201d writes The Post\u2019s own media critic Erik Wemple.

Asked about its latest blasts, EPA spokesman John Konkus told The Post that the \u201cAmerican public expects and deserves a press that provides truthful and honest reporting on important environmental issues, when the press fails to do that, it is our job to correct the record.\" \"We\u2019ll just call it progress,\u201d Wemple quipped, noting the actions the EPA took against media organizations under Scott Pruitt.

The urgent need to clean up our climate is felt by everyone and there is no reason rural America cannot be part of the cleaner energy solutions we are working toward.\u201d In the same breath, he still emphasized the need for coal power:\u00a0\"Coal will continue to be a critical part of the fuel mix in extreme weather situations like this,\" he said, referring to the recent cold snap in the eastern United States.\u00a0\"Even in states with aggressive clean energy goals, if it gets cold, we're still all going to need to work together.

We're halfway there. Tips, comments, recipes? Reach out and sign up. Thanks for waking up with us.\u00a0 A demonstrator holds a poster with a picture of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi outside the Saudi Arabia consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. (REUTERS\/Osman Orsal) COVERING UP KHASHOGGI: Five months have passed since the \u201cpre-plannned murder\u201d\u00a0of\u00a0Jamal Khashoggi and the Trump administration has yet to hold accountable the person who the CIA, bipartisan lawmakers and most members of the international community say is responsible: Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman. Despite pressure from Democrats and Republicans, President Trump has refused to provide new information on Khashoggi's death or\u00a0issue\u00a0an official determination as to who is responsible and whether to impose sanctions because of the killing through the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability\u00a0Act. Senators seeking answers\u00a0attended a \"classified\" briefing\u00a0Monday on Capitol Hill that provided \"zero\" new information, according to Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). The White House missed the deadline to submit a report last month, and there is no expectation that the White House will issue one at all.\u00a0 \u201cThe interesting thing is you have [the Trump]\u00a0administration, which is\u00a0deeply skeptical of the competence and positive intentions of the U.S. government and deeply sympathetic to the competence and intentions of infinitely less competent and well-intentioned foreign governments and while it\u2019s not the U.S.\u00a0role to change those governments, there\u2019s a certain irony in abandoning the traditional role of how we represent our people and how other governments should represent their people,\" a former State Department official said, referring to\u00a0Saudi Arabia's human rights violations.\u00a0 A Senate Foreign Relations Committee member,\u00a0Murphy believes the\u00a0futile briefing crystallized the fact the \"administration has no intent\u00a0of certifying whether MBS was or was not involved in the killing of Khashoggi,\" despite hopes that they\u00a0would. The White House didn't respond to an Oct. 10 letter from 22 bipartisan senators asking it to determine whether MBS is personally responsible for Khashoggi's killing. Murphy described\u00a0the options lawmakers can use to send a message to Saudi Arabia,\u00a0ranging from passing the War Powers Resolution to end U.S.\u00a0military support for the Saudi-led coalition\u00a0in Yemen, to temporary suspensions of arms trade\u00a0to targeted sanctions (the likeliest option to garner bipartisan support). The GOP, however, has not embraced the House-passed measure to end U.S. support for the Yemen conflict, but Murphy believes that after Monday's \"disastrous briefing, we may get a few more Republicans to support it.\"\u00a0 \u201cThe Senate will have to decide if it\u2019s going to impose its own sanctions,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told reporters after the briefing. A Rubio spokesman told us the senator is still opposed to invoking the War Powers Resolution. \u201cThe Yemen war is MBS\u2019s baby,\u201d Murphy told us. \u201cThis is a priority and to cut off support for it is a direct message to him that our relationship has to change after the murder of Khashoggi. Understanding that that's not the way most Republicans want to move, we\u2019re looking for another mechanism .\u2009.\u2009. I think the arms are the most important and relevant lever here.\u201d Murphy also charged Saudi Arabia is using arms sold the kingdom by the U.S. government to support terrorist groups. \"We now have evidence that the Saudi coalition has been taking the arms we sell them and transferring them to Islamic extremist groups after they promised not to do that,\" Murpy said. \"There has been a breach of trust over the Khashoggi murder and arms deals only workswhen there is underlying trust,\" he added.\u00a0 Side note: The administration did impose sanctions in November on 17 individuals believed to be involved in Khashoggi's\u00a0killing, but they didn't extend to MBS.\u00a0 Emboldened:\u00a0Murphy thinks the lack of punishment for Khashoggi's killing has only made it easier for the Saudis to mistreat other Americans with impunity. Take the\u00a0case of \u00a0Dr. Walid Fitaihi, a U.S. citizen whose family alleges\u00a0he has been tortured\u00a0and detained without charges in a Saudi prison for over a year.\u00a0\"There is no question that the Saudis feel like they can literally get away with murder,\" Murphy argued. NOTABLE: Two U.S. think tanks and South Korea's Yonhap News reported that two days after the failed summit in Hanoi, North Korea is \u201cpursuing a rapid rebuilding\u201d of a missile launch site it had started to dismantle after promising to do so after Kim Jong Un's first\u00a0summit with Trump in Singapore last year, Reuters's David Brunnstrom and Lisa Lambert report.\u00a0 Per a Center for Strategic and International Studies report citing satellite imagery, they concluded: \u201cActivity is evident at the vertical engine test stand and the launch pad\u2019s rail-mounted rocket transfer structure,\u201d the CSIS report said. \u201cSignificantly, the environmental shelters on the umbilical tower, which are normally closed, have been opened to show the launch pad.\u201d Closing the door?: \u201cWhile North Korea\u2019s official media said last week Kim and Trump had decided at the summit to continue talks, its Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui told reporters Kim 'might lose his willingness to pursue a deal'\u00a0and questioned the need to continue,\u201d per Reuters.\u00a0 HAPPENINGS ON THE HILL: Michael Cohen returns, Sen.

Central to this effort is Fox News. Fox personalities are now responding to the new Democratic investigative push, and the true dimensions of their efforts are coming into clearer focus: Precisely because Trump has committed extremely serious misconduct and wrongdoing on so many fronts, some of Fox\u2019s leading voices are resorting to portraying any and all oversight directed at the president as fundamentally illegitimate. Another way of putting this is that Fox personalities are arguing that Trump should be above accountability \u2014 that is, above the law. They don\u2019t put it this way, but this is what they\u2019re really saying. This is going to get quite hairy in coming days. Watch this segment that Trump tweeted out hours ago: The sheer Orwellian up-is-downism here is remarkable. Lou Dobbs claimed Democrats are engaged in a \u201csearch for a crime\u201d and are \u201cfollowing the lead of Robert Mueller and the radical Dem corruption of both the FBI and the Department of Justice.\u201d One guest scoffed that Mueller had been empowered to investigate crimes he came across \u201cin the process of investigating whatever the heck it was he was authorized to investigate.\u201d Let me help here: Mueller was authorized to investigate a hostile foreign power\u2019s massive and deliberate subversion of U.S. democracy, which it undertook to get Trump elected president. In service of that end, Mueller has already created a remarkably detailed portrait of the scope and reach of this sabotage effort. In addition to this, Mueller was authorized to investigate whether the Trump campaign colluded with that subversion effort, and other matters that arose in the process. What these folks are really saying, then, is that investigating this attack on our democracy \u2014 regardless of whether conspiracy happened \u2014 is itself corrupt and illegitimate. That Trump benefited from illicit help in getting elected \u2014 whether or not he would have won without it is irrelevant \u2014 must not be acknowledged. Needless to say, nor can the fact that Trump\u2019s top campaign officials eagerly tried to conspire in that effort (which Trump subsequently tried to conceal from the American people). No congressional investigations of Trump are legitimate The other argument Trump\u2019s allies are making is essentially that no congressional investigations of any kind directed at the president are legitimate. Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch claims in the above clip that it is a \u201cremarkable abuse of power\u201d that Democrats launched investigations without knowing beforehand whether there will be evidence of a \u201ccrime warranting impeachment.\u201d Trump approvingly quoted Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) on Fox making a similar point. And Matthew Gertz notes that on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d there was even discussion that witnesses should decline to cooperate with Democrats for this same reason. Behold the circular logic: No investigations that might lead to impeachment hearings later are legitimate because Democrats haven\u2019t gathered sufficient evidence of impeachable offenses before launching their investigations, which conveniently rules out any investigations. In reality, not only is Congress supposed to exercise oversight; gathering facts before determining whether impeachment hearings are warranted is the correct order in which to do things. Similarly, Trump also quoted Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity claiming that due to Democratic investigations, \u201cwe the people will now be subjected\u201d to \u201cmodern-day McCarthyism.\u201d The \u201cwe the people\u201d is interesting, since in 2018 a sizable popular majority elected Democrats to control the House and thus exercise oversight on Trump. But making that fact disappear is central to Trumpian propaganda: Trump also quoted the buffoonish Ari Fleischer literally describing the 2016 campaign as the \u201clast election,\" the verdict of which Democrats should heed by \u2026 not launching investigations. What Fox personalities don\u2019t want investigated The materials released by Judiciary Committee Democrats detail the documents they are seeking, as well as listing out the people in Trump\u2019s orbit who are being asked to provide them. Thus, these materials provide a guide to what Fox\u2019s personalities do not want investigated (that is, in addition to sabotage of our democracy, as noted above). A partial list: To sum up: Fox personalities don\u2019t think it\u2019s legitimate to examine whether Trump corruptly enriched himself in violation of the Constitution; deceived Republican primary voters about the financial motives behind his foreign policy agenda; directed his personal lawyer to lie to Congress to cover that up; obstructed an investigation into a foreign attack on our democracy that his own top advisers eagerly tried to conspire with; or participated in a criminal scheme that concealed from voters massive campaign finance expenditures designed to cover up alleged affairs, while lying to the American people about it. Trump\u2019s long-term political prospects depend upon keeping millions and millions of his voters in thrall to the idea that investigations into all of these matters are at their core illegitimate efforts to overturn the 2016 election. But precisely because of the immense amount of wrongdoing, misconduct and lawlessness that has already been documented on Trump\u2019s part, this in effect requires arguing that the president should be immune from accountability entirely.

Gary Herbert. (Rick Bowmer\/AP) The Trump administration is contemplating\u00a0some time-sensitive\u00a0questions about how far states can go in shrinking\u00a0Medicaid spending, as its top health officials seek to remold the low-income insurance program into a more conservative shape. It all revolves around how the Department of Health and Human Services responds to a request from Utah, which is seeking to expand its Medicaid program\u00a0less than three weeks from now. But despite pressing questions from\u00a0Democrats, HHS Secretary Alex Azar provided few hints yesterday to the House Energy and Commerce Health subcommittee in a hearing on President Trump\u2019s budget request. \u201cI see the direction you\u2019re going with this, and I don\u2019t like this,\u201d Rep. G. K. Butterfield (D-N.C.) told Azar. \u201cBut you answer to the president, and the president has the notion of taking Medicaid in the wrong direction.\u201d By April 1, Utah needs federal approval for its new plan to only partially expand Medicaid. Under the plan, which the state legislature passed to override a November ballot resolution, Utah would expand Medicaid only to people earning up to 100 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 not the 138 percent threshold envisioned under the Affordable Care Act. To improve the plan\u2019s chances for approval from the GOP-led administration, the state is also asking for its federal Medicaid contributions for the newly eligible patients to be limited to a fixed amount per enrollee \u2014\u00a0a so-called \u201cper capita\u201d structure congressional Republicans suggested in their 2017 health-care bills as a way to cut Medicaid spending overall. A spokeman for the state's health department told me the state \"anticipates\" opening enrollment on April 1 and is preparing for that date. The administration has already gone out on a legal limb by approving Medicaid work requirements in several states, which are being challenged in court. If it goes along with Utah\u2019s request, it would set new precedents for how state and federal governments can seek to limit spending on Medicaid \u2014 which covers nearly 1 in 5 low-income Americans \u2014 and whether states may\u00a0only partially expand the program under the ACA. House Speaker Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. G. K. Butterfield (D-N.C.). (J. Scott Applewhite\/AP) It\u2019s clear that lowering Medicaid spending is a fervent wish of the administration. Like its budget request last year, the White House\u2019s latest proposal suggests a cut of nearly $1.5\u2009trillion in Medicaid over a decade and for $1.2\u2009trillion to be added for the block grants or per-person caps that would start in 2021 (a block grant would also limit Medicaid spending by providing the federal portion in a single lump sum instead of as a percentage of states\u2019 total costs). And earlier this year, a small group of people within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were working on a plan to allow states to ask for their Medicaid dollars to be provided via block grants. Butterfield sharply criticized that effort at the time, and yesterday drilled Azar on how it was going. \u201cDoes the administration believe you have the authority to block grant Medicaid on your own without the participation of Congress?\u201d Butterfield asked Azar. Azar noted that states may request waivers for making changes to their Medicaid programs --\u00a0including for block grants (or, presumably, a per capita cap a la Utah). He said\u00a0if HHS were to receive that kind of a proposal, \u201cwe would have to assess that with our legal counsel\" and with the White House Office of Management and Budget. Butterfield said such a move would create a \u201cfirestorm\u201d because of the benefit cuts Medicaid programs may be forced to make under a block grant system. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply troubling to see this administration double down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt appears you\u2019re going to be aggressive with this.\u201d Alex Ruoff, health-care reporter for Bloomberg Government: The administration is juggling a lot of balls on Medicaid right now, as it seeks to open pathways for states to implement stricter rules. On Thursday, a federal judge in the District of Columbia\u00a0is scheduled to hear oral arguments in a lawsuit challenging Kentucky and the\u00a0administration for seeking to implement work requirements. The work requirements have created their own firestorm\u00a0of sorts, becoming a focal point for Democrats and progressives who accuse\u00a0the administration of trying to undermine Medicaid\u2019s core goals of providing health insurance to low-income Americans. Bloomberg's Anna Edney: Politico's Dan Diamond: In turn, Azar and CMS Administrator Seema Verma have stressed their goal is to enable people to ultimately leave the Medicaid program by obtaining coverage through a job. Azar repeated that argument yesterday. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s a fundamental aspect for able-bodied adults, if you are receiving free health care from the taxpayer, that it\u2019s not too much to ask you would engage in some form of community activity,\u201d Azar told the subcommittee.

Thousands of people were dying from overdoses linked to the potent painkiller that\u2019s 50 times more powerful than heroin. Immediate action\u00a0was critical for responding to the epidemic that\u00a0intensified over\u00a0three years, the experts warned in May 2016.\u00a0 A\u00a0major investigative report from our colleagues Scott Higham, Sari Horwitz and Katie Zezima out this morning explores what they write was \u201cone in a series of missed opportunities, oversights and half-measures by federal officials who failed to grasp how quickly fentanyl was creating another \u2014 and far more fatal \u2014 wave of the opioid epidemic.\u201d \u201cThis is a massive institutional failure, and I don\u2019t think people have come to grips with it,\u201d John P. Walters, chief of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy between 2001 and 2009, told our colleagues. \u201cThis is like an absurd bad dream and we don\u2019t know how to intervene or how to save lives.\u201d Their lengthy report includes telling graphics and striking details of a crisis leading\u00a0to the deaths of more than 67,000 people between 2013 and 2017. It also includes the names of some of the people who died during that time from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. The Post has also published a\u00a0FAQ page on fentanyl here.

It will be the third such hearing from the powerful committee in an effort to address skyrocketing prescription drug costs and will follow a February hearing with top pharmaceutical executives. The hearing should give PBMs\u00a0a chance to speak to their role in the drug pipeline, after drug execs spent part of the last hearing pointing fingers at insurers and\u00a0PBMs. \u201cMiddlemen in the health care industry owe patients and taxpayers an explanation of their role. There\u2019s far too much bureaucracy and too little transparency getting in the way of affordable, quality health care,\u201d Grassley and Wyden said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from pharmaceutical companies and it\u2019s only fair that the committee has the opportunity to ask questions of other players in the health care supply chain.\u201d President Trump. (Evan Vucci\/AP) OOF: Trump said he\u2019s \u201cvery seriously\u201d considering designating\u00a0Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. In an interview with Breitbart News, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about doing it very seriously. In fact, we\u2019ve been thinking about it for a long time. .\u2009.\u2009. As terrorists \u2014 as terrorist organizations, the answer is yes.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0three Pinocchios for\u00a0a misleading comparison of the administration\u2019s response to the opioid crisis and funds the president transferred for action on the border wall.\u00a0 During a hearing last week, the New York Democrat questioned James W. Carroll, the White House\u2019s director of drug policy, about money the president transferred from the Public Health Emergency Fund. Ocasio-Cortez asked about \u201cwhether the declaration of a public health crisis regarding opioids should have triggered a transfer of money from other agencies, a la Trump\u2019s maneuvers to build a wall,\u201d Glenn writes. \u201cDid the declaration of a public health emergency for opioids make any additional funding available to expand treatment for individuals for overdose to provide services for people in recovery?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked during the hearing.\u00a0 But the comparison of the two moves is misleading. While the president demanded nearly $6 billion from lawmakers for his proposed border wall, Congress refused to provide that funding \u2013 the impasse led to a lengthy government shutdown, which prompted Trump to declare a national emergency. He also said he would transfer funds from other agency accounts to pay for his wall. For the opioid emergency, meanwhile, Congress appropriated more than $6 billion to address the public health crisis, which means there was \u201clittle need for him to transfer funds without congressional authorization.\u201d \u201cOcasio-Cortez is making a misleading comparison,\u201d Glenn concludes. \u201cTrump has no need to transfer billions of dollars for the opioid emergency because Congress already has appropriated billions of dollars. Trump\u2019s backing of a national public-health emergency did more than raise awareness; it triggered a congressional response. So it\u2019s the exact opposite of the standoff over the wall.\u201d \u2014 Republican Sens. Joni Ernst (Iowa) and Mike Lee (Utah) unveiled a paid parental leave proposal that would allow both adoptive and natural parents to get up to three months of paid leave in exchange for delaying retirement. The Cradle Act would let new parents take one, two or three months of paid leave. They would then postpone collecting Social Security benefits at retirement for two, four or six months. \u201cOne of the most significant stumbling blocks for many new families is the lack of paid family leave for new parents...Giving every new mom and dad the flexibility to stay home for some of that time is something all Americans would like to see,\u201d the senators wrote in a Tuesday op-ed in The Post. \u201cThe question has always been: How do you pay for it?\u201d During a news conference to introduce the plan, Lee said the hope is for the proposal to be budget neutral in the long term, but said there will be around $7 billion to $9 billion in annual costs short-term, and he added they are looking into ways to offset those initial costs. Today Here's how Trump's 2020 budget proposal\u00a0would impact federal agencies:","225":"His reputation in tatters, his career hanging by a thread, Ralph Northam went home to the Eastern Shore. Where his ancestors owned slaves. Where his father wouldn\u2019t tolerate racist behavior. Virginia\u2019s governor, abandoned by his own party, accused of racism by many of his constituents, traveled to his family homestead near the Chesapeake Bay \u2014 a place apart from the rest of Virginia, yet a place where the history of black and white is as painfully enduring as anywhere. In Onancock, where Northam grew up on an isolated road, on property where his family raised sheep, many of the future governor\u2019s childhood friends left the public schools as soon as they were integrated. Northam stayed and by his senior year was one of two white boys out of the 12 basketball players in the high school team\u2019s photo. Now 59, Northam (D) stands before his constituents as a marked man. He says he will not resign, but even his allies doubt he can survive the revelation that his medical school yearbook page shows someone in blackface and someone in a Ku Klux Klan outfit. Northam says he\u2019s not in that photo, but he is no innocent: He did once wear blackface, as a costume in a dance contest. The governor says he is a product of a state and a country where racial hatred is both a nagging scar and a present danger. But he believes he is no symbol of that ugly past. He believes he is an example of change. Politicians live and die on their origin stories. They were or weren\u2019t the ones who lied about chopping down a cherry tree, or were born in a log cabin, or started out with millions from their father. Northam\u2019s story starts on a narrow peninsula of coastal villages where many families trace their local lineage back centuries, through slavery, Jim Crow, massive resistance against integration, and the civil rights movement.  In August 1907, a race riot shook Onancock. Shots were fired, a black man was badly beaten. And although a large group of white men burned and shot bullets into black-owned shops, no whites were arrested. Two-thirds white and one-third black, Northam\u2019s 1,200-person hometown in Accomack County is a place where people often speak of relations between the races as superficially cordial. Yet it is also a place, like much of America, where even today blacks and whites live very much apart. In the places that helped form Northam\u2019s attitudes, there was little debate about white people who occasionally put on blackface. In Onancock and at Virginia Military Institute (VMI), where Northam went to college, and at Eastern Virginia Medical School, where he trained to be a pediatrician, some whites in the 1970s and 1980s saw blackface as a way to express a racist worldview. But others viewed it, if they thought about it at all, as a benign comic gesture, akin to wearing a fat suit. The white hood of the Ku Klux Klan, however, has been a clear and searing symbol of white supremacist beliefs for more than a century. And where Northam grew up, the Klan was not something seen just in the movies. When Jack Johnson became one of the first black teachers at a white high school in Accomack County in 1968, he found the letters \u201cKKK\u201d \u201cwritten all over that school .\u2009.\u2009. I mean, in big letters. They had to sand blast it to take the \u2018KKK\u2019 off.\u201d Northam came up in an era of change \u2014 the overt, legally imposed change of desegregation in schools and employment, and a more organic change in demographics and attitudes. Jesse Jackson, the black civil rights leader, mounted a serious campaign for the Democratic nomination for president in 1984, the year Northam\u2019s medical school yearbook was published. In Virginia, Jackson won the caucus vote, defeating the eventual nominee, Walter Mondale. The next year, L. Douglas Wilder, a veteran state legislator, became Virginia\u2019s first black statewide officeholder when he was elected lieutenant governor. In Northam\u2019s youth, change sometimes seemed real and deep. Johnson saw that when, in the 1970s, he had a student who was a member of the Klan and spoke about it, even openly wore its emblem. \u201cHe had transferred from an all-white private school,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe kid walked around with a stick. When kids asked him why, he said it was a \u2018n----- knocker.\u2019 But the thing of it is, his whole philosophy of life changed once he got to know me. Racism is really ignorance.\u201d Yet some people changed little, if at all. In Northam\u2019s VMI yearbook, the formal portrait of a senior of Asian descent is accompanied by his nicknames: \u201cChunk, Chink, Chuuunnnngg.\u201d ***** Blacks and whites attended separate churches, led separate social lives. From elementary school through college, Northam went to schools where integration was new, where white children and black children were finding their way through a thicket of conventions and silent antagonisms that had festered for centuries. The Northams\u2019 neighbors were all white, said Sonda Dawes, who lived next door. In the restaurants in town, she recalled, you never saw black people. Young Ralph worked as a bag boy at the old Meatland grocery store, where people of all races shopped. Ralph\u2019s father, Wescott Northam, was a judge and a man of few words, but people knew he had a harsh view of racist behavior and would not tolerate epithets, longtime residents said. It was his father who finally told Ralph \u2014 during his 2017 campaign for governor \u2014 that his great-grandfather and great-great grandfather both owned slaves. Virginia was the cradle of American slavery, the first place in the newly colonized land where human beings were bought and sold. Yet the state is also where American ideals of equality and freedom were first codified. The Northam ancestors freed slaves in 1858 and 1863, historical records show. Race, Northam said in an interview Saturday, \u201cwas not really something that we talked about.\u201d He described his childhood home as \u201can environment of equality\u201d but added, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any question that I grew up with racial insensitivities.\u201d Even before schools were desegregated, Northam said, he had black friends who came to his house to play basketball, baseball and football. \u201cIt was kind of a gathering area for the kids,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we had a lot of good times there.\u201d ***** Northam was in sixth grade, and his childhood friend J. Tom Edmonds was in fourth, when Accomack County schools were integrated. \u201cThere were black and there were white schools,\u201d said Edmonds, now an eye surgeon in southeastern Virginia. \u201c.\u2009.\u2009. And one year, we were all lumped in together.\u201d Edmonds and Northam were placed in a predominantly black school, South Accomack Elementary, where Edmonds said he felt the need \u201cto learn to take a back seat and just accept that I was a newcomer.\u201d He recalled a moment when a group of black students taunted his white friend and cut his long hair with scissors. But he also remembers befriending two black students who helped him adapt. Northam \u201cwas going through the same thing,\u201d Edmonds said. \u201cIn the long run, it opened up our eyes and made us better people. In the short run, it caused a lot of anxiety.\u201d After sixth grade, Edmonds\u2019s parents enrolled him in an all-white school, Broadwater Academy, telling him he\u2019d have a better chance to get into college. Northam said he could not recall any family discussion about whether to switch. \u201cI just did whatever, basically, I was told,\u201d he said, noting that his father was a prosecutor. \u201cSo he was in public service, and I think he really wanted to make sure that we stayed in public schools.\u201d He started at Onancock High three years after it opened its doors to black children under threat of a lawsuit by the U.S. Justice Department. He was in the academic program, populated mostly by whites, while many blacks were in the school\u2019s vocational program. In his senior year, Northam and two black girls were dubbed the class\u2019s \u201cmost dignified\u201d students, according to the yearbook. One of those women, Janet Conquest, now an elementary school teacher, was surprised to see Northam end up in politics; she\u2019d always seen him as \u201ca good guy, because he was pretty quiet and I was quiet, too. .\u2009.\u2009. He didn\u2019t stand out.\u201d Before integration, Conquest recalled, there were separate public bathrooms for \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201ccolored\u201d near the factory where her mother worked pressing shirts, and an all-white pool in the nearby town of Onley. She never did learn to swim. Black kids and white kids rarely socialized outside of school, and Conquest felt watched when she went into stores. \u201cAs a child, some things felt dangerous, and you knew you had to stay away,\u201d she said. Inside the high school, life could seem smoother. Terry Smoot, Northam\u2019s earth science classmate under Mrs. Smith, one of four black teachers in the 1977 yearbook, said there were few confrontations over race there. One night in their senior year, though, Smoot, Northam, a black boy and a white girl drove to Richmond for a model general assembly convention. Northam was to play the role of attorney general; Smoot and the others were delegates. The 1960s Impala they were in overheated. Pulled over along Interstate 64, the three boys hopped a fence and approached a home to ask for water to fill the radiator. \u201cThe woman wouldn\u2019t open the door,\u201d and would speak only through a back window, Smoot said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she was thinking for sure, but there was a black student with us. It was my impression that was it.\u201d In 1984, the same year Northam graduated medical school, Samuel H. Cooper Jr. ran for clerk of the court, becoming the first black man in Accomack County elected to public office. Some white residents who came into his office refused to make eye contact, he recalled. \u201cAs human beings we do not like change,\u201d said Cooper, 64, who remains in office more than three decades later. \u201cAnd my being here was a big change.\u201d  Friends, neighbors and schoolmates \u2014 liberal and conservative, black and white \u2014 rallied around Northam last week, not simply because he is from their town, but because they believe he is not what his yearbook page implies. Jesse Poulson, who was Northam\u2019s typing teacher, heard about the photo and \u201ccouldn\u2019t wrap my mind around it, because I did not see that Ralph Northam. When he was elected, I said, \u2018Oh Lord, I hope they don\u2019t ruin him.\u2019 \u201d Poulson, who is African American, moved from the county\u2019s all-black school to Onancock in the first year of full integration. Having heard other teachers talk about the tensions they expected between white and black students, he decided to do what he could to help integration work. \u201cYoung people cluster,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d naturally segregate themselves. I wanted to make sure that everybody had an opportunity to mix; therefore, I assigned the seats. .\u2009.\u2009. And as such, I didn\u2019t have problems.\u201d There were few overtly racist acts, but Poulson saw things. He often moved around his classroom, reviewing students\u2019 work. When someone was doing well, he\u2019d pat them on the shoulder. One white student didn\u2019t like that. \u201cAs I was walking away from this young man, he took his hand and used it to brush off his shoulder,\u201d Poulson recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018I know who you are now.\u2019\u2009\u201d During Northam\u2019s high school years, someone bestowed on him the nickname \u201cCoonman,\u201d a moniker that could have reflected his rural upbringing, or a racial slur. A former classmate, Rob Leatherbury, thinks he might have come up with the name, but said he can\u2019t recall where it came from. Northam followed Leatherbury to college at VMI, which students from that time remember as a place where racial animosities were rarely open and blacks and whites bonded over the rigors of an unforgiving environment. \u201cThe first year is trying to stay alive physically,\u201d said Oscar T. Arauco, a cadet during Northam\u2019s time there who is Latino. \u201cThe second year, you\u2019re trying to stay alive academically. It\u2019s supposed to be hard. It was not a place where background made much of a difference. Everyone was treated equally well and equally poorly \u2014 poorly because it was a military school.\u201d Northam\u2019s VMI roommate, Howard Conduff, recalled being with him in Army ROTC summer camp in Fort Bragg, N.C., in 1980. They were headed home for the Fourth of July weekend. A black woman in Northam\u2019s platoon who also lived on the Shore didn\u2019t have a ride. Conduff, who is white, was driving his\u00a0\u201clittle ol\u2019 red Camaro\u201d and said there wasn\u2019t enough room for the woman. Northam insisted she come along. \u201cShe ended up going with us, and that\u2019s a great example of Ralph\u00a0Northam,\u201d Conduff said. \u201cWe sang and had a good ol\u2019 time.\u201d Medical school students are often well into their 20s, yet at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, collegiate antics mixed in with the grueling hours of study. The yearbook for Northam\u2019s class shows students dressed as giant Crayola crayons, Mr. Peanut, clowns and in more risque outfits, such as a yearbook staffer posing as a gunman with a woman who looked like she\u2019d stepped out of a brothel. The book also shows three men in drag \u2014 and blackface \u2014 posing as the Supremes. Being black there was not much different from being black in America, said Horatio \u201cRay\u201d Millin, who overlapped with Northam at the school and headed its black student group. \u201cEVMS is a slice of American culture .\u2009.\u2009. and American culture has racism as its primary thread,\u201d said Millin, 67, a native of the Virgin Islands who is now a psychiatrist in Louisiana. Millin recalled black and white students sitting separately at Brannigan\u2019s diner, downing black bean soup, burgers and beers. Friends say it was sometimes hard to get Northam to put aside his studies and go there. Northam\u2019s medical school roommate, Rob Marsh, who had served as a medic in the military, decorated their apartment in Norfolk with three flags \u2014 the Stars and Stripes, Virginia\u2019s state flag and a POW\/MIA black banner. A visiting classmate asked Marsh and Northam about a symbol that wasn\u2019t on their walls. \u201cHow come you guys don\u2019t have the rebel flag?\u201d the classmate said. The roommates looked at each another. Northam responded: \u201cBecause that war is over.\u201d Accomack County remains deeply conservative. Northam lost the county to Republican Ed Gillespie in 2017, and Donald Trump trounced Hillary Clinton there in 2016. For the past 13 years, Northam has attended First Baptist Church of Capeville, a largely African American congregation about 40 miles down the Shore from Onancock. Northam approached the pastor there, the Rev. Kelvin Jones, shortly before making his first run for a state Senate seat. \u201cWe sat down as two men, one who happened to be black and one who happened to be white,\u201d Jones recalled. Since then, Northam has been a steady and devoted presence, Jones said. He and his wife are among a handful of white families in the church. The races still live separate lives in many ways, the pastor said, though they come together to reflect and celebrate on occasions like Martin Luther King Jr. Day. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know that any great strides are made out of those gatherings,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat changes afterward?\u201d Yearbooks are snapshots of a time, their pages full of pictures that summon memories of proud moments and embarrassing choices. The final spread in Northam\u2019s high school yearbook, the 1977 edition of the Trident, contains a single, two-page photo of a lush sunset, framed by two couples, each shown in silhouette. On the left page, what appears to be a white couple face each other, holding hands. The right page shows what looks like a black couple in a similar pose.","226":"When President Trump\u2019s longtime fixer Michael Cohen testified last week that his former boss was a \u201cracist\u201d and \u201ccon man\u201d who routinely skirts the law, Republicans showed little interest in following up on his claims. They shrugged when Trump called murderous dictator Kim Jong Un a \u201creal leader\u201d and once again elevated the North Korean leader on the world stage. And faced with a vote on Trump\u2019s legally contested declaration of a national emergency at the Mexican border, just 13 of 197 House Republicans opposed him. Acquiescence to Trump is now the defining trait of the Republican Party more than two years into his presidency \u2014 overwhelming and at times erasing principles that conservatives viewed as the foundation of the party for more than a half century. Trump\u2019s ownership of the GOP was on vivid display again Saturday, when the president appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland, an annual gathering that has transformed into a raucous celebration of Trump, featuring propaganda-style art and a speaker who declared that the president was \u201cchosen by God.\u201d Standing before an exuberant crowd chanting \u201cTrump!\u201d and \u201cU-S-A,\u201d Trump spent two hours railing against the \u201cfailed ruling class,\u201d calling the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation \u201cbullshit\u201d and portraying his election as a major moment in global history. \u201cWe are reversing decades of blunders and betrayals,\u201d Trump declared at one point, before asserting that he was only joking in 2016 when he asked Russia to release Hillary Clinton\u2019s private emails. \u201cLock her up! Lock her up!\u201d CPAC attendees roared at the mention of the former Democratic presidential nominee. In interviews over the past week, Republicans on Capitol Hill offered an array of reasons for their unflinching loyalty to Trump as the 2020 campaign begins to take shape: a deep-seated fear of his pull with their supporters in primary races; fraying consensus about conservatism as nationalism takes hold of the party; and shared partisan disdain for Trump\u2019s perceived enemies in the news media and the Democratic Party. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to turn on our own and make the Democrats happy,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), who is up for reelection in 2020. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any benefit in fracturing, but we do see a lot to lose.\u201d Republicans say Trump\u2019s overhaul of the federal judiciary and the confirmation of two Supreme Court justices, along with the passage of the GOP\u2019s sweeping tax law, have helped bind the party together through bouts of political turbulence \u2014 from the loss of their House majority to the longest government shutdown in history to the torrent of developments related to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s ongoing probe of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. All of it has left Trump firmly in control. Most potential 2020 primary challengers sit on the sidelines as the GOP establishment rallies around Trump\u2019s reelection. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who once gave Trump a jar of hand-selected Starbursts candy as a gift, is a Trump booster and confidant. Former GOP foes in the Senate, such as Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and Rand Paul (Ky.), flatter him and are regulars at his golf courses. \u201cThey fetishize this nonconservative in the Oval because it\u2019s tribal,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a veteran GOP strategist and Trump critic. \u201cIt\u2019s us versus them, we\u2019re right and they\u2019re evil, and it\u2019s created this Trump cult that dominates the party.\u201d Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.), a Democrat who fended off Trump\u2019s attempts to unseat him in last year\u2019s midterm election, said of Republicans: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they allow all of this stuff to go on. I would bet money two years ago \u2014 20 years ago \u2014 that this would never happen. I\u2019m not sure Watergate would be prosecuted under the conditions we have today.\u201d Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) publicly acknowledged what many Republicans say privately: The GOP is wholeheartedly accepting behavior and policies from Trump that would spark outrage from a Democratic president, particularly Trump\u2019s attempt to use executive power in defiance of Congress to secure funding for a wall along the Mexican border. \u201cIt\u2019d be a little different,\u201d Simpson said with a chuckle. \u201cIf President Obama had done the national emergency, Republicans would have gone crazy.\u201d Nonetheless, most Republicans backed Trump\u2019s move last month, seeing it as a political exit ramp for the president as he flailed during the latest shutdown fight. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) urged Trump not to do it, only to eventually accept it. When House Democrats forced a vote Tuesday on legislation to overturn Trump\u2019s declaration, just 6 percent of House Republicans dared to break publicly with Trump. One defector was Rep. Thomas Massie (Ky.), a libertarian-leaning Republican who is well known for clashing with leadership. Trump backers in his ruby-red district were incensed. \u201cI\u2019m feeling it right now,\u201d Massie said. \u201cLots of phone calls for voting that way. But it\u2019s okay, because my district knows me. For those who don\u2019t have that brand, it\u2019s more dangerous for them to try and take an independent path, because they\u2019ll be seen as being against the president.\u201d Opposition among Senate Republicans has been more visible. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), facing a difficult reelection race next year, has said he would vote to curb Trump\u2019s use of emergency powers in this instance, worrying that a Democratic president could \u201cexploit\u201d those powers in the future. Three GOP moderates \u2014 Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) \u2014 have also voiced opposition to Trump\u2019s declaration and called on him to withdraw his plan or risk a rebellion. But Trump had an ominous warning for those GOP critics in an interview last week with Fox News anchor Sean Hannity: \u201cI think they put themselves at great jeopardy.\u201d On foreign policy \u2014 long the bastion of Republican hawks who have been hostile to dictators and supportive of global institutions \u2014 Trump has been cast as a GOP hero, despite his feuds with allies, protectionist trade policies and chummy engagement with autocrats such as Kim, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. When Trump declared after a summit with Kim in Hanoi last week that the North Korean leader was not responsible for the death of former prisoner and U.S. college student Otto Warmbier, most Republicans stayed mum. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a hell of a job as commander in chief,\u201d Graham said at CPAC on Thursday. Trump\u2019s near daily dismissal of the Mueller investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d has become another GOP refrain. Trump\u2019s elected allies, such as Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), have buoyed the cause, repeatedly questioning the integrity of the Justice Department and FBI in the process. Partisan loyalty to an embattled president has plenty of historical precedents. Many Republicans stood by Richard Nixon during Watergate and by Ronald Reagan during the Iran-contra scandal. Bill Clinton was supported by most Democrats even as he was impeached on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. Any high-profile voices in the party objecting to Trump are increasingly scattered or silent, while the \u201cNever Trump\u201d faction from the 2016 campaign has all but fallen into obscurity. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who served as a foil to Trump and called him \u201cdangerous,\u201d passed away in August. Former president George H.W. Bush died in November, and his son, George W. Bush, shuns attention. Other onetime opponents have retreated, such as Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who has quarreled with Trump at times but has mostly stayed out of the spotlight. Former Massachusetts governor William Weld has expressed interest in running against Trump in the Republican primary, but he is little known nationally. Former Ohio governor John Kasich (R) continues to toy with the idea but has not committed to a bid. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) is also intrigued, but has said an insurgency would be futile unless Trump\u2019s GOP support crumbles. According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll in January, 75 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents approve of Trump\u2019s performance in office. The Republican National Committee, led by Romney niece and Trump ally Ronna McDaniel, is using aggressive measures to stave off any possible primary threat. RNC members passed a resolution giving Trump the party\u2019s \u201cundivided support\u201d and effectively merged with Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cThey will lose horribly,\u201d McDaniel said at CPAC about Trump\u2019s potential Republican primary challengers. Graham, who has undergone a dramatic metamorphosis from noisy Trump foe to vocal supporter, isn\u2019t worried about the scandals engulfing the White House. \u201cI think people know what they\u2019re going to get with President Trump,\u201d Graham said in an interview. \u201cA lot of people said some of the same things about him in the campaign. I\u2019ve come to get to know the president. I like him, I understand his warts.\u201d But Cohen, who served as a top RNC official following Trump\u2019s 2016 victory, offered words of caution for the president\u2019s defenders during his House testimony Wednesday. \u201cI did the same thing that you\u2019re doing now,\u201d Cohen said, addressing Republicans on the panel. \u201cAnd I can only warn people, the more people who follow Mr. Trump as I did, blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I\u2019m suffering.\u201d Cohen was given a three-year prison sentence in December for lying to Congress, tax evasion and breaking campaign finance laws. He will report to prison in May.","227":"President Trump said Friday that his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen had \u201cdirectly\u201d asked him for a presidential pardon, a claim that Cohen promptly branded part of \u201canother set of lies\u201d from the president. \u201cBad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon,\u201d Trump said in a tweet. \u201cHis lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied! Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again! He also badly wanted to work at the White House. He lied!\u201d In his tweet, Trump, who has been seeking to discredit Cohen as he cooperates with federal prosecutors, referenced congressional testimony last week in which Cohen said he had never asked for, and would not accept, a pardon from Trump. Lanny Davis, a lawyer for Cohen, later said that before July, Cohen directed an attorney to explore possibilities of a pardon with Trump\u2019s lawyers. After that point, Davis said Cohen authorized him to say publicly that he would never accept a pardon and that remains true. In response to Trump\u2019s tweet, Cohen wrote on Twitter: \u201cJust another set of lies by @POTUS @realDonaldTrump.\u201d \u201cMr. President .\u2009.\u2009. let me remind you that today is #InternationalWomensDay,\u201d Cohen continued. \u201cYou may want use today to apologize for your own #lies and #DirtyDeeds to women like Karen McDougal and Stephanie Clifford.\u201d McDougal, a former Playboy playmate, and Clifford, an adult-film star, are two women for whom Cohen has said he arranged hush payments at Trump\u2019s direction to conceal alleged affairs with Trump. Cohen is set to report to prison in May for three years stemming from charges that include campaign-finance violations related to those payments. Other charges included lying to Congress and financial improprieties. Trump and his Republican allies have also sought to undermine Cohen by arguing that his testimony that he didn\u2019t want to work in the White House is inconsistent with what prosecutors have said and what he has told associates. Cohen spent three days on Capitol Hill last week in dramatic public and private hearings in which he apologized for lying to lawmakers and divulged what he said Trump knew about financial infractions and Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. In a public hearing before a House hearing last week, Cohen also attacked Trump\u2019s character, calling him a con man and a racist and voicing deep regret for working by his side for more than a decade. Cohen returned to Capitol Hill this week to provide additional closed-door testimony.","228":"Good morning, Power Uppers. Happy\u00a0\u03c0 Day! (Although every day is a good day to eat pie, FYI). Tips, comments, pie recipes?? Reach out, forward this email to your friends, sign up. Thanks for waking up with us.\u00a0 NEW THIS MORNING: Beto O'Rourke is officially in the race. From The Post: \"The former congressman who lost his 2018 bid to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, has entered the presidential race after months of speculation and meetings with high-ranking Democrats, including former president Barack Obama.\"\u00a0 HE ALONE *CAN\u2019T* FIX IT?: President Trump is known for his \u201cI alone can fix it\u201d approach \u00a0\u2014 but it doesn\u2019t appear to be enough to extinguish the political firestorm that\u2019s about to erupt from the Senate. Trump spent all week trying to convince Republicans not to cross him on border security -- lunching with lawmakers, calling them directly, and firing off tweets and statements that were alternatively threatening and cajoling. Yet despite his best efforts, the Republican-controlled Senate is poised to rebuke Trump's emergency declaration along the U.S.-Mexico border. 'Putting\u00a0the squeeze on': Trump's allies on the Hill say Trump's personal outreach frenzy\u00a0is the latest evidence that Trump is running the White House as he would run the Trump Organization.\u00a0 No dice: Ultimately, though, these efforts are falling flat. Uniquely Trumpian: Trump's hands-on approach has been described by lawmakers and sources\u00a0on Capitol Hill as uniquely Trumpian.\u00a0 My colleagues Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and John Wagner report that Trump himself called Lee yesterday to \"express his opposition\" to\u00a0his plan to restrain presidential emergency powers in the future. Lee\u2019s measure, which would have expired national emergencies after 30 days unless Congress voted to keep them, was seen as a compromise that could limit Republican votes on the separate measure to nullify Trump\u2019s current emergency.\u00a0 Shortly after the call, Lee announced he would vote for the disapproval resolution on Thursday.\u00a0 \"Lee\u2019s announcement ensures there will be majority support for the disapproval resolution, which already passed the House,\u201d my colleagues write. \u201cSenate passage will send the measure to Trump, forcing him to issue the first veto of his administration to strike it down. Although Congress lacks the votes needed to override Trump\u2019s veto, the Senate vote would still stand as an embarrassing rejection of a key Trump initiative at the hands of his own party.\u201d\u00a0 Not the only defeat for Trump: The Senate also voted yesterday to rebuke of the Trump administration's support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.\u00a0 Exasperation on the Hill:\u00a0\u00a0The president throwing cold water on Lee's compromise plan on the border highlighted to some how, in Trump's administration, it's\u00a0up to Trump to call the shots.\u00a0 My colleagues Seung Min and Erica had reported on Tuesday that in a meeting with Republicans that day that\u00a0\u201cPence floated the prospect of revising the 30-day period to 30 legislative days, which could considerably drag out that timeline, according to one official familiar with the discussions.\u201d Pushback: But a White House official made clear to Power Up that there was no deal\u00a0for Pence to quarterback.\u00a0 'Simply a gross inaccuracy': The letter below is a copy of the first page of a three-page letter that the White House distributed to GOP senators drafted by legal scholars who argued why Trump's national declaration is not an unconstitutional power grab.\u00a0 \"SUCKED\": The FAA finally decided to follow our counterparts around the world yesterday in grounding the Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 after reviewing\u00a0airplane data showing similarities between the deadly crash in Ethiopia last Sunday and the one that\u00a0occurred in Indonesia several months ago, The Post reports.\u00a0 Trump made the abrupt announcement after Boeing and the FAA insisted earlier in the day on Wednesday that the planes were still safe to fly.\u00a0 'Unusual step': Trump made the announcement as \"there were growing questions about the slow response to the crisis and whether the nation\u2019s top air-safety officials acted quickly enough to protect the flying public,\" my colleagues\u00a0Luz Lazo, Michael Laris, Lori Aratani\u00a0and Damian Paletta\u00a0report.\u00a0 The decision process: \"Trump was inclined to announce a grounding on Tuesday, but he received pushback from the FAA, which had not yet reached a decision, according to officials familiar with the deliberations.

The departure is the strongest sign yet that Mueller and his team have all but concluded their work.\u201d What we're reading:\u00a0","229":"Donald McGahn, the former White House counsel who at times clashed with President Trump over the ongoing special counsel probe but led his overhaul of the federal judiciary, told The Washington Post on Sunday that he will rejoin his former law firm, Jones Day, this month \u2014 a move that was long expected by his friends and keeps him ensconced in conservative legal circles. McGahn, 50, said he will lead the firm\u2019s government regulation practice as a partner in Washington and will stay involved with senior Senate Republicans as an outside adviser on nominations to the Supreme Court and federal courts. \u201cI enjoy the practice of law and I look forward to coming back to Jones Day,\u201d McGahn said in an interview, adding: \u201cI\u2019m just going to practice law. No paid corporate speeches and no books, unlike some others who have worked in the White House.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he will continue to seek his support on nominations. \u201cWe keep in touch and talk from time to time,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cSome would argue we were co-conspirators going back to the 2016 campaign, where we worked on the number one priority I had and the president had.\u201d McGahn, who left the West Wing last October, was a key figure in the selection and confirmations of Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh, whose nomination last year was roiled by sexual misconduct allegations. According to two Senate GOP aides, McGahn has recently boosted Neomi Rao, Trump\u2019s nominee to replace Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in phone calls with lawmakers. Rao has encountered some Republican resistance, with a few GOP senators questioning whether she would expand abortion rights. McGahn declined to comment  about private exchanges. McGahn\u2019s moves inside and outside the White House have drawn criticism for giving conservative groups such as the powerful Federalist Society and their allies too much influence in the judicial nomination process. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen the equivalence of the Federalist Society in any administration prior, either Republican or Democratic,\u201d said Walter E. Dellinger, a former acting solicitor general for President Bill Clinton. \u201cYou have the White House, Federalist Society and Senate leadership working together in an unprecedented way.\u201d Leonard Leo, the group\u2019s president, said McGahn has been \u201cinvaluable\u201d to the conservative cause and will \u201ccontinue to share information and ideas\u201d with him and others at the Federalist Society. During the Trump administration\u2019s early months, McGahn was central in installing conservative lawyers throughout the government with the intent of curbing federal power \u2014 a low-profile but sweeping effort former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon described as \u201cdismantling the administrative state.\u201d In the interview, McGahn said he was \u201cproud and honored\u201d to have helped Trump on judicial and regulatory work and did not have regrets about his experience. McGahn\u2019s latest practice at Jones Day will focus on related issues, working with private interests on regulatory matters and litigation, as well as on crisis management. It is a departure from his previous work on election law. McGahn said several colleagues from his time in the White House are planning to join him at the firm. McGahn first joined Jones Day as a partner in 2014, after a five-year stint at the Federal Election Commission, where he served as chairman, often controversially, because of his push to weaken campaign finance regulations. He also was counsel to the National Republican Congressional Committee. He was succeeded by White House counsel Pat Cipollone. Since October, McGahn has spent time with his family and made a handful of public appearances, including lectures at law schools, Oxford University and Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidential library. McGahn said he would not be lobbying, which requires lawyers and others to formally register with the federal government. Jones Day, a well-known global law firm, counted the Trump campaign as a client throughout the 2016 campaign, with McGahn serving as the campaign\u2019s attorney and occasionally hosting Trump and his advisers at its offices. When Trump won the New Hampshire primary, a smiling McGahn stood on the stage behind him. The firm\u2019s managing partner, Stephen Brogan, was once considered for a leading position on the president\u2019s legal team. McGahn\u2019s tenure at the White House was marked by historic success in confirming Republican judicial nominees \u2014 29 circuit judges and dozens more to district courts \u2014 and near daily turbulence as Trump lashed out at special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. McGahn, especially during the beginning of Trump\u2019s term, cautioned the president about contacting Justice Department officials and even told associates he was worried that Trump was doing so without his knowledge. The two men would have \u201cspectacular\u201d fights, according to a person who witnessed some of them and spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private events. McGahn has been interviewed by Mueller\u2019s investigators several times and cooperated with them as they probe the president\u2019s conduct and the possible obstruction of justice. McGahn\u2019s relationship with Trump\u2019s family and top advisers \u2014 eldest daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2014 was fraught because he regularly \u201chad to tell them \u2018no\u2019 and they didn\u2019t like to hear that,\u201d according to a White House aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. When Trump early last year directed his then-chief of staff, John F. Kelly, to give Kushner a top-secret security clearance, both McGahn and Kelly wrote memos expressing their concerns, according to current and former administration officials.","230":"Unable to get his way, the president announces that he will make an emergency declaration\u00a0to finance his border wall.","231":"WARSAW, Poland \u2014 Poland\u2019s finance minister said Monday she is aiming to keep the country\u2019s budget deficit within European Union rules even after a series of pre-election spending pledges to help families, young people and pensioners. Teresa Czerwinska said she is hopeful that Poland\u2019s budget deficit will be below 3 percent of the country\u2019s annual GDP, as required by EU law. She rejected speculation that she offered her resignation over the increased spending. But many economists found the increase in spending concerning, a sign that the government is willing to worsen public finances to win elections. By contrast, the 2018 deficit was only 0.5 percent of annual GDP. The leader of the right-wing ruling party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, announced new benefits last month in a campaign speech ahead of May elections to the European Parliament and a general election in the fall. The Law and Justice party ranks highest in opinion polls after ramping up spending on social policy. The cost of the benefits is estimated at some 20 billion zlotys ($5.2 billion) this year. At the same time, the government says it has no money to grant teachers\u2019 demand for a 1,000 zlotys ($262) monthly raise. Talks were being held Monday to avert a nationwide strike planned by teachers\u2019 unions next month, though hopes for a deal were low.","232":"When Paul Manafort\u2019s prison sentence for violating various federal laws was extended to more than seven years by Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Wednesday, the aggregate sentences received by people linked to President Trump stretched to more than a decade. Manafort, as you probably know, was Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign chairman for several months, though the crimes to which he admitted weren\u2019t related to that service. (They were, instead, related to lying, witness intimidation and various financial wrongs.) With a finalized prison sentence, he joined Trump\u2019s former personal attorney Michael Cohen, who was sentenced to three years for committing fraud and for admitting to violating campaign finance laws by facilitating payoffs in 2016 to two women who alleged sexual encounters with Trump. A third Trump campaign associate has, unlike Manafort and Cohen, already served his sentence. That was George Papadopoulos, an adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign who admitted to lying to investigators working with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. He served two weeks. What\u2019s remarkable about this is that all three men rose to prosecutors\u2019 attention because of their work on and for Trump\u2019s campaign. Meaning that they will end up collectively serving far more time than Trump will serve in office \u2014 even if Trump serves for two terms. They aren\u2019t the only people sentenced to time in prison after being targeted by Mueller\u2019s probe. Richard Pinedo was caught after he provided bank account numbers to Russians who were allegedly engaged in an effort to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election. Alex van der Zwaan was a member of Manafort\u2019s extended circle who also admitted to lying to investigators. He ended up being deported. And remember, these aren\u2019t the only people who will be sentenced. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn \u2014 also an adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 is yet to be sentenced for lying to Mueller\u2019s team. Manafort\u2019s longtime business partner Rick Gates is similarly awaiting his fate. Roger Stone, who\u2019d worked with Trump for years, was indicted in January on various charges and could also spend time in prison. In other words, the two-and-a-half presidential terms to which Manafort, Cohen and Papadopoulos have already been sentenced may be on the low end of the spectrum. The upper end remains unclear \u2014 as do any additional names that might contribute to the total.","233":"Voters delivered an unequivocal message in the midterm election: A Democratic House majority must exercise oversight to check an out-of-control president. This week, that\u2019s precisely what they did. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) on Friday introduced a resolution to short-circuit President Trump\u2019s fraudulent declaration of emergency. The Texas congressman knows there is no border \u201ccrisis,\u201d and frequently notes that border crossings have declined precipitously over the last decade or so. Castro tweeted an invitation asking Democrats and Republicans alike to \u201csupport this joint resolution to terminate President Trump\u2019s unconstitutional national emergency declaration to build his border wall. It sets a dangerous precedent and steals congressional authority.\u201d In restating the principles of separation of powers and calling out Trump\u2019s affront to the Constitution, he and fellow Democrats demonstrated their faithfulness to their oaths of office. Democrats also acted to pressure Attorney General William P. Barr to release the full report from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III (which we learned would not be completed this week). In a letter to the AG, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), Committee on Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), Committee on Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) and Committee on Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.). wrote: After nearly two years of investigation \u2014 accompanied by two years of direct attacks on the integrity of the investigation by the President \u2014 the public is entitled to know what the Special Counsel has found. We write to you to express, in the strongest possible terms, our expectation that the Department of Justice will release to the public the report Special Counsel Mueller submits to you \u2014 without delay and to the maximum extent permitted by law.\u00a0 There also remains a significant public interest in the full disclosure of information learned by the Special Counsel about the nature and scope of the Russian government\u2019s efforts to undermine our democracy . . . . If the Special Counsel has reason to believe that the President has engaged in criminal or other serious misconduct, then the President must be subject to accountability either in a court or to the Congress. But because the Department has taken the position that a sitting President is immune from indictment and prosecution, Congress could be the only institution currently situated to act on evidence of the President\u2019s misconduct. To maintain that a sitting president cannot be indicted, and then to withhold evidence of wrongdoing from Congress because the President will not be charged, is to convert Department policy into the means for a cover-up. The President is not above the law. This seems to lay the groundwork for the same process we saw during Watergate, when the special counsel, Leon Jarworski, made a referral to Congress with material needed to proceed with impeachment. Finally, on Tuesday, Cummings announced that Trump\u2019s former attorney, Michael Cohen, will testify publicly on Feb. 27. So as not to intrude on Mueller\u2019s work, Cohen will not talk about matters relating to the Russia probe. However, Cummings said that Cohen will testify about \u201cthe President\u2019s debts and payments relating to efforts to influence the 2016 election; the President\u2019s compliance with financial disclosure requirements; the President\u2019s compliance with campaign finance laws; the President\u2019s compliance with tax laws; the President\u2019s potential and actual conflicts of interest; the President\u2019s business practices; the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.; the accuracy of the President\u2019s public statements; potentially fraudulent or inappropriate practices by the Trump Foundation; and public efforts by the President and his attorney to intimidate Mr. Cohen or others not to testify.\u201d Cohen will testify behind closed doors before the Intelligence Committee on Feb. 28. In sum, through legislation, public pressure and oversight, House Democrats are attempting to prevent Trump\u2019s unconstitutional power grab, assure the greatest transparency possible regarding the Russia probe, and hold Trump accountable for his lies and misdeeds. This is how the system is supposed to operate, and what House Republicans utterly failed to do in the first two years of the Trump administration, in dereliction of their oaths of office. For returning us to some semblance of constitutional order, we can say, well done ladies and gentlemen of the Democratic House majority.

At an awards ceremony Sunday, the UAE named the winners of its Gender Balance Index for the second round of 2018 in three categories: best personality supporting gender balance, best federal authority supporting gender balance and the best gender balance initiative. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, vice president of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai, gave out the awards, which were accepted by an all-male cast. Lt. Gen. Sheikh Saif bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE\u2019s deputy prime minister and interior minister, was awarded the first prize, while male representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority and the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratization also received awards. In a news release, Maktoum said that gender equality was in the spirit of the founding father of the Emirates: \u201cThe achievements of Emirati women today reaffirm the wise vision of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, who believed in the importance of the role of women, and their right to work and become key partners in society.\u201d But the fact that there were zero women among the winners announced Sunday drew widespread criticism and mockery. \u201cBest Gender Balance Awards Ever,\u201d deadpanned Nicholas McGeehan, a human rights researcher who tracks the handling of migrant workers' rights in Persian Gulf sheikhdoms. According to the news release put out by the Dubai media office, Maktoum \u201crecognized the efforts\u201d of one woman \u2014 Sheikha Manal bint Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum \u2014 but she did not win an award. She is the head of the UAE\u2019s Gender Balance Council and wife of a deputy prime minister. \u201cDuring the Index\u2019s second edition, recipients of the Index\u2019s awards happened to be entities led by men,\u201d the UAE Gender Balance Council said in a statement after the award\u2019s received media attention. \u201cThis is indicative of the great and extraordinary progress we have made as a nation, where men in the UAE are proactively working alongside women to champion gender balance as a national priority.\u201d In previous years, the UAE\u2019s Gender Balance Index has honored women. In 2017, the same year that the index was launched, the UAE launched a program to try to become one of the top 25 countries in the world for gender equality by 2021. Despite the poor optics, the UAE is the highest-ranked Persian Gulf state for gender equality and second only to Israel in the wider Middle East, according to the United Nations. The country was listed as 34th among nations in a 2017 ranking, just behind Poland. However, activist groups argue that the country has not fully implemented laws that would stop discrimination against women. In its 2018 country report, Human Rights Watch noted that discrimination on the basis of sex and gender was not included in a 2015 anti-discrimination law and that current law permits domestic violence by a husband against his wife. This post has been updated to include a response from the UAE Gender Balance Council.
