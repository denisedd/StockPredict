Today, they\u2019ve traded places. Their forecasts indicate that the chance of accumulating snow very early Friday has increased a little while Sunday night\u2019s snow outlook has dimmed. A rather weak area of low pressure will pass to our south while modestly cold air seeps in from the north. This combination may squeeze out light snowfall across the region. Models have come into reasonably good agreement that light rain, snow or a mix of precipitation could begin after 10 p.m. Thursday. Temperatures above freezing mean precipitation should initially melt. But into the predawn hours Friday, any rain or mixed precipitation should change to snow from the Beltway to the north and west as the air cools to near freezing. Some accumulation is possible here, especially in our colder north and west. South and east of the Beltway, precipitation may end up as more of a wintry mix with little or no accumulation likely. This is expected to be a short-lived event, with the bulk of the precipitation over by Friday morning\u2019s commute. That said, some delays and cancellations cannot be ruled out Friday. Here\u2019s how much snowfall the models project for the District: The National Weather Service has issued an initial accumulation outlook (shown below), which we find reasonable. Its amounts are on the low end of models, but some of the snow predicted by models will melt at first with temperatures above freezing. The key to snowfall materializing will be precipitation falling fast enough to cool the air and ground. If the precipitation ends up being light and patchy, little or no accumulation is probable. But there is a chance of a moderate burst of snow, which would cool the environment enough for accumulation. It\u2019s premature to say where the heaviest snow will occur. Some models, like the NAM and Canadian, suggest that a heavier band of snow may form north of the District, while the GFS predicts it to set up south of town. We would lean toward the most snow happening north and northwest of the District, simply because it is normally colder there. Considering temperatures may rise to near 50 on Thursday ahead of the event, dropping temperatures back down enough for accumulating snow to occur may prove a challenge around the city and south and east, unless the precipitation is heavy. Overall, we think the chance of at least an inch inside the Beltway is about 40 percent but increases to 60 percent to the north and west. We\u2019ll attempt to draw a detailed snowfall forecast map in our update Thursday. As an Arctic front sinks south late Sunday while a storm develops along its southwest flank, the question for our region becomes: Which arrives first, the cold air or the precipitation? If the cold air seeps south quickly, before the bulk of the precipitation moves in, we could see a moderate snowfall. But if the precipitation begins before the arrival of the cold air, this will mostly be a rain event. Models have gently shifted toward the latter and more of a rain event since yesterday. The European model, which we put the most stock in, hangs the front back to our west as low pressure forms over the Tennessee Valley and scoots northeast over West Virginia. This draws enough mild air northward for rain beginning Sunday afternoon, continuing into the night. The GFS model brings the cold front through fast enough so that rain, which begins Sunday morning, might mix with and change to sleet and then snow late Sunday afternoon into Sunday evening from northwest to southeast. A little accumulation would be possible in this scenario, especially in our colder areas to the northwest, where the changeover to snow happens quickest. The Canadian model is in the European model camp, forecasting more of a rain event. As we\u2019re still more than four days away from this event, which is highly sensitive to small changes in the front\u2019s timing and the track of the storm, we wouldn\u2019t yet shut the door for snow. \u201cThe models have been jumping from one solution to another over the past few runs,\u201d said Wes Junker, Capital Weather Gang\u2019s winter weather expert. \u201cThis jumpiness is always a caution for trying to be too specific about a forecast.\u201d He added: \u201cUntil the storm track and intensity of the precipitation is resolved, there is no way to say anything more about the forecast for the storm than there is a chance of rain or snow. \"","1":"As an upbeat Howard Schultz tucked into lunch in Washington recently, he was having a good week because Democrats were having an awful one. The former Starbucks chief executive, who is contemplating a plunge into politics, knows that his narrow path to the presidency as an independent depends on the Democratic Party becoming as offensive as the Republican Party has become. So, because his political prospects depend on the Democratic Party making normal people wince, he cannot be displeased by: Numerous Democratic presidential candidates embracing the Green New Deal in the nanosecond before it became a punchline. Various candidates telling 180 million Americans to have stiff upper lips about losing their private health insurance under Medicare-for-all. One candidate, Sen. Kamala D.\u00a0Harris (Calif.), saying: There will be less paperwork when the government runs health care. Really. Another candidate, Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), who is vegan, saying that eating meat threatens the planet. New York and Virginia Democrats, expanding \u201creproductive rights\u201d to include infanticide, saying that infants who survive late-term abortions will be kept \u201ccomfortable\u201d while they die of neglect. House Democrats swatting an anti-Semite in their caucus, but having to live with rising anti-Israel sentiment among their base. And remaining hostage to a ubiquitous colleague who became the face of (a) socialism and (b) freshman Democrats by capturing a safe seat after winning a primary with the grand total of 16,898 votes. Democrats are spewing fury about Schultz, who they think might siphon off anti-Trump votes and become Ralph Nader redux. In 2000, when George W. Bush won the presidency by defeating Al Gore in Florida by 537\u00a0votes, Nader, running as the Green Party candidate, received 97,488 Florida votes, thereby probably defeating Gore. Schultz is startled but undaunted by Democratic vituperation. He says that getting on the ballot in all 50 states will be no problem, and he sees a path to 270 electoral votes \u2014 assuming the Democratic nominee embodies a compound of high-octane progressivism and weirdness (see paragraph two above). A decision to run, which Schultz probably must make by early this summer, long before the Democratic nominee will be known, will involve two wagers, the first of which is that Democrats will oblige him by ideological self-indulgence. If, as is probable, he becomes a candidate, and if, as is not probable, he quickly attracts significant support, he might tug Democrats toward the center. This would weaken the rationale for his candidacy, but not erase it, because two of his animating concerns \u2014 fiscal recklessness (trillion-dollar deficits while the economy grows) and obliviousness regarding the rickety structure of entitlements (Social Security, Medicare) \u2014 are as serious as they are perilous. Schultz hopes Americans want to hear the truth about fiscal mismanagement; he knows they might obliterate a candidate who tells them the truth and what should be done about it. This is why candidates avoid these subjects. Schultz knows that even the most successful third-party candidate failed: In 1912, former president Theodore Roosevelt \u2014 universally known, widely admired, vastly experienced, politically gifted \u2014 bested the incumbent president, William Howard Taft, who won just eight electoral votes, but Roosevelt himself was trounced by Woodrow Wilson, 435 electoral votes to 88. No third-party candidate has won electoral votes since 1968, when George Wallace, who won just 13.5 percent of the vote, carried five states because he had a regional base, the South. He was, however, a wine that did not travel. Wallace had a vivid personality, as did the sandpapery Ross Perot, who in 1992 won 19 percent of the popular vote, but no electoral votes. Schultz is as mild as oatmeal, which is admirable and conceivably marketable. His other wager (besides that Democrats will nominate someone who makes normal people queasy) is that Americans, exhausted and embarrassed by politics-as-a-mixed-martial-arts-cage-match, will be ready for someone whose message begins with a simple question: \u201cIs this really the best we can do?\u201d The antecedent of \u201cthis\u201d is: A president who calls his alleged porn-star mistress \u201cHorseface.\u201d A supine Republican Party that is content to have the president make a mockery of the basic constitutional architecture, the separation of powers, by declaring a national emergency because of a legislative disappointment, thereby nullifying Congress\u2019s core power, control of spending. And an opposition party that thinks the United States needs a lot more government supervision of everything, and that this would mean a lot less paperwork. There. Now, try to argue with a straight face that a challenge to today\u2019s party duopoly would subtract from the stock of excellence in government. Read more from George F.

If nothing changes between now and the vote, that means both chambers of Congress will have combined to void the declaration. Practically speaking, this signifies less than it might seem. Trump could, and likely will, simply veto it, at which point both chambers would need to produce two-thirds majorities to override the veto. Neither chamber has those kinds of numbers voting against the declaration \u2014 much less voting for a veto override. The national emergency would then move forward. But it\u2019s worth taking stock of how significant this moment is \u2014 and how it could potentially impact the battle that actually will decide the fate of the national emergency declaration: the legal case. We have seen over and over again how a closely divided GOP-controlled Senate has come close to rebuking the president. Almost always, holdouts like Paul, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and then-Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) were prevailed upon to toe the line in the end. When enough Republicans have crossed over to rebuke Trump, it has almost always been in symbolic ways: Jamal Khashoggi, Trump\u2019s trade wars, the media not being \u201cthe enemy of the people,\u201d and the withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan. This time, there\u2019s meat on the bone. The GOP-controlled Senate would actually be taking concrete action to stop Trump, thereby forcing Trump to veto something. It would be his first veto, in fact. This registers that he is acting in clear opposition to \u2014 and overturning \u2014 the will of Congress. That matters from a PR standpoint. Congress not only declined to give Trump the money for his border wall even when he shut down the government over it, but now it would be explicitly disapproving of his effort to get around its decision not to appropriate the money. That\u2019s two rebukes on the same issue, and Trump would be pushing past both of them. The question from there is whether those twin rebukes might also matter for the legal battle. However people feel about this particular national emergency declaration, Congress did give the presidency rather broad authority to declare such emergencies. When it passed the National Emergencies Act in the 1970s, it handed over some of its constitutional authority over the purse strings of government. That authority has not been tested like it is now, but that does not mean the courts will necessarily say it goes too far. Paul, for one, thinks that it will. He is actually predicting that the Supreme Court will strike down the national emergency declaration if and when it comes to that point, and he says Congress\u2019s votes will matter. \u201cWe spent the last two months debating how much money should be spent on a wall, and Congress came to a clear conclusion: $1.3 billion,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWithout question, the president\u2019s order for more wall money contradicts the will of Congress and will, in all likelihood, be struck down by the Supreme Court.\u201d Ohio State University law professor Peter M. Shane also thinks the votes could matter: The joint resolution underscores the big-picture constitutional dimension of the fight. Congress\u2019 power of the purse is its heavy artillery in the scheme of checks and balances. The Constitution underscores its significance through redundancy. Not only does Article I vest the spending power in the legislative branch, but a separate provision bars the executive branch from spending money unless appropriated. If presidents can find ways to work around Congress\u2019 rejection of their requested spending priorities, Congress\u2019 big gun has been silenced. ... A joint resolution underscoring that Congress has deliberately rejected the inclusion of border wall fencing in response to a presidential request could well move a court to say that this statute will not help finance it. Jessica Levinson of Loyola Law School says this is likely to come down to whether the courts (a) decide to narrowly interpret the statute or (b) focus more on whether there is actually an emergency and whether Trump has this authority. \u201cIt certainly adds weight to the idea that this is executive overreach and a blatant and problematic end-run around Congress,\u201d Levinson said. \u201cThey not only decided not to appropriate the funds, but are saying even more definitively, \u2018Do not do this. Do not go around us.\u2019\u201d Levinson pointed to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold Trump\u2019s travel ban last year, though, as an example of how it might keep its focus on the statute. The court said in its 5-4 decision that determining Trump\u2019s underlying motives \u2014 including about potentially banning Muslim immigration \u2014 from his tweets and public comments was beyond its responsibilities. Since then, Trump has appointed and gotten another justice confirmed, Brett M. Kavanaugh. In this case, though, the court would not have to surmise how Congress feels about its authority being usurped; it would have votes on which to base the idea that Congress clearly did not want Trump to take an action involving a power that it afforded him. The courts could also reason, of course, that if Congress really dislikes what Trump is doing, it could stop him by providing more votes. \u201cIt is also possible that some justices who are more inclined to support the administration would take the view that Congress has it within its power to terminate the national emergency and has failed to do so, and so the court should not step in and do something that Congress wasn\u2019t willing or able to do itself,\u201d said Keith E. Whittington of Princeton University. \u201cBut the fact that Congress would have only failed because of the high bar of a veto override should weaken that latter position somewhat.\u201d In short, we have no idea how compelling the courts will find these votes, but it\u2019s possible Paul\u2019s decision may not just be another toothless symbolic rebuke.","3":"One should never feel sorry for anyone working in President Trump\u2019s White House. They volunteered for this dreadful and chaotic administration. But it\u2019s hard to envy those tasked with writing drafts of his State of the Union address. Trump is an incumbent who behaves as if he is in the opposition. He relishes bemoaning the terrible things happening to the country on his watch \u2014 after two years of unified Republican government. At the same time, it\u2019s hard to recall a president more boastful about how great he is and how he has accomplished more than anyone who has ever held his job, which presumably includes Washington, Lincoln and FDR. Trump is so in love with bragging that he even touts events that are anything but achievements. On Jan. 4, 2018, Trump proudly tweeted: \u201cDow just crashes through 25,000. Congrats!\u201d He recycled the same thought last Wednesday: \u201cDow just broke 25,000. Tremendous news!\u201d Think about it: Taken together, the news from the two tweets is that the stock market has been flat for a year, hardly joyous tidings for investors. But recall that Trump told us years ago in \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d that he engages in \u201ctruthful hyperbole,\u201d which can \u201cplay to people\u2019s fantasies.\u201d The problem is that we never know for certain if the fantasist himself believes the tales he is spinning. The latest fantasy, described Friday  to journalists by Trump aides, is that his speech Tuesday will be a unifying, bipartisan call to end old divisions and heal old wounds. Good luck with that, especially because his aides say he\u2019ll also focus a large part of his speech on immigration. Will he be able to stay away from his staple references to \u201ccriminal aliens,\u201d \u201cdrug dealers \u201d and those coyotes he loves to summon? The president, as my Post colleague Monica Hesse pointed out , regularly (and questionably at best) describes female migrants as being \u201ctied up\u201d with \u201cduct tape\u201d on their faces. Will such phrases disappear, too? And how credible can calls for bipartisanship be from a man who predicted Thursday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) might someday be \u201cbegging for a wall\u201d? What we can be sure of is self-congratulation over Friday\u2019s report that the economy added 304,000 jobs last month. Trump may talk about all of the regulations he has scrapped (though probably not with a lot of specifics, since most voters don\u2019t cotton to dirtier air or water, or less policing of shady banking practices). He might mention his corporate tax cut, even if it\u2019s unpopular and has fallen far short of the promises made on its behalf. But Trump can never get too upbeat, because he decided long ago that his political project depends on inciting anxiety and anger as well as hostility toward (nonwhite) outsiders. This requires him to conjure a dystopian world because what he fears most is a world in which fear is abating. There was one truly unforgettable line in his inaugural address: \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\u201d But the carnage can never end because Trump must argue he and his wall are all that stand between us and chaos, duct tape, gangs and coyotes. This isn\u2019t working. Even members of that base he\u2019s obsessed with expect the president they voted for to solve problems and not simply exploit them. That\u2019s why his core support is shrinking. The survey number that should trouble Trump most is a recent Post-ABC News poll finding that only 28 percent of Americans said they would definitely vote for him in 2020. Maybe that\u2019s why Trump\u2019s lieutenants insist he\u2019ll try something different this week. The Democrats\u2019 choice of Stacey Abrams to respond to Trump will highlight his dilemma. Selecting the party\u2019s 2018 Georgia gubernatorial nominee certainly underscores the party\u2019s diversity and the importance of African American women in its coalition, as The Post\u2019s Eugene Scott noted. But as important is the fact that she describes herself with two words often miscast these days as polar opposites: \u201cprogressive\u201d and \u201cpragmatic.\u201d She\u2019s also an optimist who believes that \u201cthe further ahead we get, the harder it is to drag us back.\u201d The largest contrast Tuesday night will thus not be the obvious disparity in the backgrounds of two speakers, but in their spirit: hope vs. carnage. No matter how hard his speechwriters work to make him buoyant and collegial, Trump needs to depict a country facing a petrifying crisis. It\u2019s the only way can justify what he does.

That\u2019s an offensive question. You can\u2019t go to your organization, to your players, to your coach, and say, \u2018Let\u2019s plan to lose.\u2019 .\u2009.\u2009. We\u2019re not going to sleep on development of the team, but no, we\u2019re not tanking in hopes that we finish last in the league and have a couple percentage points better chance of getting the ping-pong ball for the top pick in the draft.\u201d With Wall out for the season after undergoing heel surgery, Leonsis, the Monumental Sports and Entertainment CEO, was first asked two weeks ago in London about the possibility of the Wizards turning their attention to next year rather than trying to sneak into the playoffs. \u201cWe will never, ever tank,\u201d Leonsis said then. The Wizards have gone 3-3 since that trip, and at 22-29 they remain 2\u00bd games out of the Eastern Conference\u2019s eighth and final playoff spot. Leonsis said Thursday that his \u201cexpectations are we are going to make the playoffs and improve on last year,\u201d which ended in a first-round loss to top-seeded Toronto. When asked if Washington is planning to be active before the Feb. 7 trade deadline, Leonsis said the front office will \u201csee what\u2019s out there,\u201d but to not expect a major shake-up with the future in mind. \u201cI love when [fans] go, \u2018Trade Bradley Beal, trade John Wall, trade Otto Porter,\u2019\" Leonsis said. \u201cAnd I go, \u2018Okay, for who?!' We\u2019re not trading any of those players.\u201d Host Bruce Alan told Leonsis that team President Ernie Grunfeld, who was hired in 2003, was \u201cby far the most popular subject\u201d of the questions submitted by listeners ahead of the segment. Is Leonsis happy with Grunfeld\u2019s performance? \u201cI\u2019m happy if we meet our goals,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t meet our goals, we have to sit down and take stock on what do we have to do to improve during the offseason.\u201d Leonsis said the same applies for third-year Wizards Coach Scott Brooks. \u201cIn pro sports, every job is at risk every year,\u201d Leonsis said. \u201cYou really do use an offseason to take stock of what you do, but you do that by talking to the players, by talking to the agents, by talking to people within the organization, people with the league office. It\u2019s not something that you make light of.\u201d Leonsis has made it clear that his primary goal for the Wizards is reaching the postseason, something more than half of the NBA\u2019s teams accomplish every year and Washington has done in four of the past five seasons. \u201cWe are under .500, but the season\u2019s not done and we have to continue to fight and show our fans that we\u2019re not mailing it, that we think we can make the playoffs,\u201d he said. \" .\u2009.\u2009. Once you make the playoffs, anything can happen.\u201d Except for the Wizards, it seems. Washington hasn\u2019t been to the Eastern Conference finals since 1979. At the end of the segment, a caller asked Leonsis if the Wizards have any plans to try to free up some salary cap space \u201cin case an elite player becomes available\u201d in free agency or via a trade. \u201cWe think that the draft is a way that we can improve our team, and we might be able to make some trades around the edges before Feb. 7 or at the trade deadline, and then next offseason we would have to look at what is the best road for us to follow,\u201d Leonsis said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t throw in the towel on this core. .\u2009.\u2009.

Or that things are really worse? Some Democrats running for president have tried to make the case that the good economic news is simply an illusion \u2014 that people are working two or three jobs to (take your pick) \u201cpay the bills,\u201d \u201cput food on the table,\u201d and \u201csurvive.\u201d All of them, so far, have avoided the pitfall of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who started this line of attack last summer. Ocasio-Cortez, at the time a novice politician who had just won her primary, went way too far and earned Four Pinocchios. The Democrats who have followed her path have more carefully crafted their lines. Here\u2019s a guide to the rhetoric, from the worst to least-inaccurate. As this is a roundup, we\u2019re not awarding Pinocchios. But no one would earn any Geppettos. \u201cUnemployment is low because everyone has two jobs. Unemployment is low because people are working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and can barely feed their family.\u201d \u2014 Ocasio-Cortez, interview on PBS\u2019s \u201cFiring Line,\u201d July 13, 2018 Ocasio-Cortez got into trouble because she made a causal connection \u2014 the unemployment rate was low because everyone has two jobs. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that the percentage of people working two jobs has actually declined since the Great Recession \u2014 and been relatively steady at around 5 percent since 2010. The percentage bounced around a bit but it was as low as 4.5 percent in August 2017 and was 5.0 percent in the February jobs report, the most recent available. \u201cAfter reaching a peak of 6.2 percent during 1995-96, the multiple job-holding rate began to recede,\u201d the BLS noted in a report. \u201cBy the mid-2000s, the rate had declined to 5.2 percent and remained close to that level from 2006 to 2009. In 2010, the multiple job-holding rate decreased to 4.9 percent and has remained at 4.9 percent or 5.0 percent from 2010 to 2017.\u201d \u201c[They say] \u2018the economy is great, it is doing great for everybody.\u2019 And then you ask them, well, how is that? Well, they\u2019ll point to the stock market. Well, that\u2019s fine if you own stocks. Then you\u2019ll ask them, what\u2019s your other measure? And they\u2019ll talk about well, the unemployment rate is down. That\u2019s fine. Yeah, well, I\u2019ve been traveling our country. People are working. They\u2019re working two and three jobs to pay the bills. It\u2019s not working for working people.\" \u2014 Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), remarks at the Power Rising Summit in New Orleans, Feb. 22 We had earlier spotlighted Harris\u2019s use of this spiel. She appeared to drop it from her stump speech the day after our fact check, but in recent weeks it has returned. But Harris is much more careful than Ocasio-Cortez. She does not link it directly to the unemployment rate. She appears to suggest this is an anecdote. We had earlier faulted her for not stating that directly, and now she\u2019s added a sentence to make that clearer: \u201cWell, you know, I\u2019ve been traveling our country.\u201d But the number of people who are working two or three jobs is pretty small \u2014 and getting smaller. There are almost 156 million people with jobs. But only 251,000 people had two full-time jobs in February, compared with 343,000 in February 2018, according to BLS. That\u2019s a decline of more than 25 percent. Another 4.5 million had both a full-time job and a part-time job, while nearly 2 million were juggling part-time jobs. In all, there are 7.8 million people who hold more than one job. \u201cI have already shared with you that many are working second or third jobs \u2014 in fact in Texas, half of your colleagues are working a second or third job just to put food on the table.\u201d \u2014 former representative Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Tex.), in remarks in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, March 15 O\u2019Rourke was apparently speaking to a teacher when he made this aside. His spokesman says that O\u2019Rourke was referring to a study released by the Texas State Teachers Association (TSTA). In August, the union said that a survey of its members found that 39 percent of teachers expect to take extra jobs outside the classroom to meet family expenses. But this appears to be a self-selected survey, not a random sample. \u201cThis was an online survey of Texas State Teachers Association teacher members. We have about 50,000 teacher members, and we encouraged them by email to participate in the survey,\u201d said Clay Robison, a TSTA spokesman. Some 974 teachers participated. In other words, these results cannot be applied to all Texas teachers; they only reflect the answers of the people who decided to answer the survey. By contrast, the U.S. Education Department conducts a nationally representative sample survey of public K \u2014 12 schools, principals and teachers in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The most recent survey shows that 17 percent of teachers in the South \u2014 and 18 percent across the country \u2014 supplemented their income with a job outside the school system.  That\u2019s higher than the overall population \u2014 but much lower than \u201chalf\u201d as stated by O\u2019Rourke. He earns points for at least having a specific example, but it\u2019s based on fishy data. \u201cMillions of Americans are forced to work two or three jobs just to survive.\u201d \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), in a speech in North Charleston, S.C., March 15 Sanders does not pussyfoot around and simply draws on the BLS data \u2014 which as we noted shows that nearly 8 million people hold more than one job. But most of those extra jobs are part time, not full time. And as we noted, the \u201cmillions\u201d of people amount to just 5 percent of Americans with jobs. So that means 95 percent are not working two or three jobs \u201cjust to survive.\u201d So Sanders certainly has the most accurate sound bite. But it\u2019s lacking important context, making it misleading. Each of these 2020 candidates are straining to make the economy appear worse. In doing so, they are following the example of President Trump, who in his campaign for the presidency repeatedly used to make a similar claim about people having to hold more than one job, such as saying in September 2016: \u201cMany people, because of Obamacare and for other reasons, are holding two jobs.\u201d Now of course, he claims otherwise: \u201cWe had people working three jobs, two jobs, and they were doing worse than they did 20 years ago. That\u2019s not happening anymore.\u201d Actually, no matter how hard politicians try to spin it, the percentage of people with two or more jobs has been around 5 percent for almost a decade. Democrats suggesting this is something new \u2014 in an era of unusually low unemployment \u2014 are misleading their supporters.

The NFL Network analyst and former general manager on Tuesday delivered a scathing summary of Murray\u2019s performance at the league\u2019s recently concluded scouting combine, prompting a strong pushback from the quarterback\u2019s college coach Wednesday morning. Casserly wasn\u2019t talking about how the Oklahoma quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner fared in on-field drills, because Murray did not take part in any of those at the combine, opting merely to have his physical measurements taken. Those were enough to boost his stock in a big way when the undersized star checked in at a shade above 5-foot-10. Murray also sat for interviews with a reported 10 NFL teams, and it was during at least a few of those sessions that he came up, well, very short. That\u2019s at least according to Casserly, who claimed the feedback he got from teams amounted to \u201cthe worst report I\u2019ve ever heard on a top-ranked quarterback from the interview part of it.\u201d \u201cThese were the worst comments I ever got on a top-rated quarterback, and I\u2019ve been doing this a long time,\u201d said the 70-year-old Casserly, who spent three decades in the NFL as a scout and a personnel executive with the Washington Redskins and Houston Texans. \u201cLeadership \u2014 not good. Study habits \u2014 not good. The board work \u2014 below not good.\u201d \u201cNot good at all in any of those areas, raising major concerns about what this guy is going to do,\u201d Casserly continued. He added that Murray \u201cbetter hope\u201d Arizona Cardinals Coach Kliff Kingsbury, whose team has the No. 1 pick and who asserted last fall that he would use just such a selection on the ex-Sooner, follows through on that, \u201cbecause this was not good.\u201d Lincoln Riley, Murray\u2019s coach at Oklahoma, pushed back in an interview on \u201cThe Dan Patrick Show\u201d on Wednesday, arguing that \u201call [Murray] cares about is winning.\u201d With Murray at quarterback, the Sooners went 12-2 last season, including a 45-34 loss to Alabama in a College Football Playoff semifinal. \u201cI just hate that people go out and make these comments and [they] haven\u2019t talked to the two people who\u2019ve actually coached this kid,\u201d Riley said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to teammates. You went off what one team said. That\u2019s probably a smokescreen, knowing how the draft [with all its rumors and subterfuge] works. Kyler was a tremendous leader for us, a tremendous leader, very aggressive. All he cares about is winning. I think our team took on that personality, without a doubt.\u201d Riley expressed skepticism about Casserly\u2019s report, saying, \u201cI know Kyler met with a lot of different teams at the combine and I personally have spoken with a majority of the teams he met with and every one of them were glowing in their reports about Kyler, basically the complete opposite of what Charley threw out there.\u201d By showing that he had just enough size to plausibly perform as a quarterback in the NFL, particularly in light of the success of Russell Wilson and the league\u2019s increasing embrace of concepts imported from college football, Murray made himself a strong contender to go No. 1. A backup to Baker Mayfield before last season and an athlete expected to become a professional baseball player after being selected ninth by the Oakland Athletics this past June in the MLB draft, Murray exploded on the scene by completing 69 percent of his passes for 4,361 yards, 42 touchdowns and seven interceptions, adding 1,001 yards and 12 scores on the ground. That, according to Riley, is a skill set that college football and the NFL have not seen. \u201cAs far as processing offense,\u201d Riley said Wednesday of Murray, \u201che just had the greatest single season in the history of college football, so I think he can process just fine.\u201d That kind of ability \u2014 plus the stated interest of Kingsbury \u2014 has many analysts believing that Arizona will in fact lead off the draft with Murray, despite already having a young quarterback, Josh Rosen, drafted 10th last year. Casserly helped build the hype for Murray on Tuesday by reporting that a team told him the Cardinals were shopping Rosen. However, Casserly followed that up by passing along what he described as extremely unflattering reviews of Murray. Claiming he spoke with \u201cmore than two teams\u201d about their interviews with the quarterback and \u201cgot exactly the same story,\u201d Casserly said: \u201cThey were not impressed with his leadership skills or potential for the interview. They weren\u2019t impressed with his study habits, and I can\u2019t give you the quotes, but they\u2019re pretty bad. And they were not impressed with his board work and understanding football and concepts that he was quizzed on, and that wasn\u2019t good. .\u2009.\u2009. One thing that stuck out to me: This guy was never trained for the interview. Whoever trained him did a poor job.\u201d That point garnered some agreement online Tuesday, with CBS Sports analyst (and former quarterback) Danny Kanell tweeting that when he interviewed Murray at the Super Bowl, the Heisman Trophy winner \u201ccame across as unsure and unprepared.\u201d Kanell noted that the apparent lack of polish in interviews \u201cdoes not mean he can\u2019t play,\u201d but he said that to be an effective quarterback, \u201cyou have to be a good communicator.\u201d Others pointed to a televised interview Murray did shortly before the Super Bowl with Patrick, in which Murray interspersed moments of awkward silence with halting, non-engaging answers. \u201cI was just curious if it looked as bad as it sounded,\u201d Patrick said later, \u201cbecause, man, it sounded bad \u2014 where it\u2019s just silence and I\u2019m going, \u2018Hey, these [microphones] are on,\u2019 and I couldn\u2019t get anything out of him.\u201d Riley had an explanation for that interview Wednesday. \u201c[Murray] was in a tough position because he hadn\u2019t made up his mind [about whether to choose football over baseball],\u201d he told Patrick. \u201c.\u2009.\u2009. He\u2019s such a good kid. He doesn\u2019t want to lie.\u201d However, as NFL Network\u2019s Daniel Jeremiah pointed out, if the Cardinals are actually putting Rosen on the trading block, then Murray \u201caced the only interview that matters.\u201d To that remark, NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport tweeted that he \u201cdid hear\u201d that Murray \u201cwas impressive\u201d in his interview with Arizona. On the other hand, another well-connected NFL Network personality, Rich Eisen, cited sources Tuesday in reporting that the Cardinals have told Rosen that \u201che\u2019s their guy.\u201d Eisen also noted that, with Murray\u2019s pro day at Oklahoma scheduled for March 13, no NFL team, including Arizona, has come close to completing its evaluation. Casserly wound up taking a few shots Tuesday, with some questioning his ability to judge quarterback prospects, given the top-three picks he spent on the underwhelming Heath Shuler and David Carr. Others were only too happy to bring back to light decidedly uncomplimentary comments made about the former general manager in 2010 by none other than Bill Belichick. Responding to a report by Casserly that Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was playing at the time with broken ribs, Belichick said that \u201clike he usually is, [Casserly] was 100 percent wrong.\u201d He added: \u201cWho\u2019s been wrong more than Charley Casserly since he left the Redskins?

Moments later, at the blast of an air horn, the cages are opened in unison and the birds take flight, the force of 28,000 wings generating gusts of wind as the pigeons hurtle in a single direction: to Baghdad.\u00a0 Six months of practice runs and strict conditioning culminate in a launch that lasts less than a minute. But the birds carry with them the hopes of men who have spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours training them. These are the highflying pigeon races of Iraq. From October to March, when Iraq\u2019s winter temperatures climb down from the triple digits of the summer, thousands of Iraqis race their pigeons in contests that can stretch as far as 600 miles, from Mosul in the north to Basra in the south, competing for bragging rights, modest purses and the satisfaction of knowing they raised a champion. Elite birds, which can fly up to 90\u00a0mph, are much sought after, with racing pigeons from a coveted European lineage costing $4,000. One such bird sold at auction for $93,000 in Basra. A stable of pigeons usually numbers between 50 and 100, with each prize bird requiring about $100 worth of feed, vitamins, herbal teas and omega-3 supplements per racing season to maintain peak fitness. Pigeon racing, a sport on the decline in the United States and Europe, where it was developed, is taking off in Iraq. After nearly 20 years of conflict in the country, the rising popularity of pigeon racing is a signal that \u201cour people want to practice peace,\u201d said Kamil Khinyab, the 52-year-old undisputed godfather of pigeon racing in Iraq.\u00a0 It is a peace that comes high above the perpetual gridlock, heavily armed soldiers and chaos of Baghdad\u2019s streets. In their rooftop pigeon lofts, the hobbyists are in total control. \u201cIf your pigeon wins, it\u2019s only because of your efforts. If it loses, it\u2019s because you need to do better raising it,\u201d Khinyab said with a smirk.\u00a0 The ranks of the pigeon fanciers include medical doctors, academics, high-level military, police, intelligence service officers and engineers. These are prestige professions, and judging from the investment required, this is not a sport for the riffraff. But the racers have long been stigmatized as scoundrels. They are known locally as \u201cmatyarchi.\u201d At best, they\u2019re regarded as loners who waste their life doting on a bird that lacks any prestige. At worst, they\u2019re suspected of being perverts who use their high-perched pigeon lofts to spy on neighbors or sneak a peek at the woman next door hanging laundry.\u00a0 One saying in Iraq goes, \u201cNever trust the testimony of a matyarchi.\u201d When someone looks to the sky furtively, others often inquire: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You have the eyes of a matyarchi.\u201d The term itself drips with contempt. The Arabic suffix \u201cchi\u201d is generally reserved for bad habits and jobs of low social status. In Iraq, an excessive drinker is an \u201carakchi.\u201d A gambler is known as a \u201cqamarchi,\u201d while the guy who fixes flat tires is \u201cbancharchi.\u201d But Khinyab and his community of pigeon fanciers say they\u2019re engaging in a cerebral and competitive gentleman\u2019s sport.\u00a0\u201cWhat makes someone successful at this hobby is intelligence above all \u2014 then care and mercy for the birds, which Iraqis have in abundance,\u201d he said. Khinyab knows what he\u2019s talking about. He revolutionized the sport in Iraq. An engineer by training, he came to racing in 1999 when a friend showed him how a pigeon, just 3 months old, could find its way home from 140 miles away.\u00a0 \u201cI was fascinated with how intelligent they were, and I fell in love,\u201d he said. He asked his friend and a cousin who also raised pigeons to give him a few birds to train, and he set up a rooftop coop, building high walls around it to protect his reputation. Khinyab collected 23 birds, paying 210,000 dinars for one he was sure would be a perennial winner. Back then, that sum could furnish an entire house or buy a reliable car. \u201cI faced a lot of criticism from my family, but I\u2019d show them [European] magazines where they listed pigeons worth $5,000 and $10,000.\u201d\u00a0 His early results didn\u2019t help his cause. During training sessions, all 23 of his pigeons flew away and never returned. Despite the costly blunder, Khinyab rebuilt his stable. He learned the key was to launch the pigeons close to their loft at first, until they reliably returned home, and then gradually increase the distance over time. What started as an obsession has now turned into a career. He runs Baghdad\u2019s best-known pigeon club \u2014 a place that sells antifungal and anti-worm solutions, vitamins and other imported products needed to raise the fastest, strongest and smartest pigeons. It is also a gathering place for pigeon fanciers, a must stop for visitors from other provinces keen on learning the latest tradecraft. On a recent evening, Khinyab presided over a boisterous gathering of competitors who had come to register their pigeons for a race the next day. As male and female birds were separated to prevent unwanted breeding, the owners exchanged warm greetings with hugs and kisses, referring to one another with the honorific \u201cChampion.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s competitive,\u201d Khinyab said. \u201cBut there\u2019s also a deep brotherhood among the participants.\u201d\u00a0 In pigeon racing, the birds are launched together, and then each bird flies to its home.\u00a0 Back in the day, owners would track their pigeons by tearing a dinar note in half, so that each half showed the same serial number, and then affixing one half to a pigeon\u2019s leg and giving the other to a judge. The owners would wait at home for their birds to arrive, then grab the pigeon\u2019s half of the dinar note and furiously drive to a club and check in with the judges.\u00a0 It was woefully imprecise. Racers whose lofts were closest to the club were almost always declared the winner. Khinyab devised a better system. He divided a map of Baghdad into districts, and judges were assigned to locations within a mile of all the lofts in their district. The new system was quickly embraced by fellow racers. But it took the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein to bring the races into the modern era. The country, which had been cut off by sanctions and government corruption, was flooded with imports of all types. Amid the new marvel of cellphones and the myriad brands of blue jeans, there was now a possibility to import computer devices known as Bricon machines, invented in Belgium for the sole purpose of pigeon racing. Pigeons could be outfitted with a leg ring containing their registration number, and it would be digitally recorded when they reached their loft. Khinyab brought thousands of the devices to Iraq, and interest in the sport soared. Just as pigeon racing has exploded in popularity, so too has the practice of kidnapping prize birds for ransom. One village, located along the Baghdad-to-Basra Grand Prix route, has become infamous. Young men and boys wait on the edges of the village, Talihah, until they spot flocks of birds flying toward their destination. Using sticks, stones and pieces of barbed wire, the would-be kidnappers try to bring down the birds without killing them.\u00a0 Most owners attach their phone number to their birds\u2019 legs. The pirates call and demand a sum of about $20 to $30 or mobile phone credits. Along Talihah\u2019s muddy, unpaved roads, the bandits are unapologetic. Asked whether the village is indeed known for pigeon piracy, Hussein, a 32-year-old shopkeeper, proudly responded, \u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d \u201cIf they manage to cross our village safely, they\u2019re in the clear,\u201d added 19-year-old Wissam. \u201cThis is the most dangerous place for them.\u201d Sattar Dayekh, a 40-year-old pigeon breeder who lives in the village, doesn\u2019t condone the banditry, but he said he understands why his neighbors commit it. \u201cThese are poor kids looking to make some money,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the racers don\u2019t pay them, they\u2019d stop hunting them. Besides, they can afford it.\u201d A few days after the Zubaydiya race, Khadim Hamid, a 49-year-old who owns a welding shop, was taking stock of his racing pigeons. All 50 made it home, but none had broken into the top 10 \u2014 the benchmark for a good run. Though his home is stacked with trophies, the latest result bothered him. \u201cTo be a winner, you should know what your bird needs only by looking at it and provide it for it,\u201d he grumbled. Race purses are never more than $100 or $200 for a first-place finish. The real money comes in raising champions and selling them to other racers for breeding. And then there\u2019s the sheer satisfaction of bragging rights. Pigeon owners spend the six months ahead of the racing season chirping about how they are the best. \u201cWhen the season comes, there\u2019s no bigger pleasure than shutting them up,\u201d Hamid said. So he said he was contemplating spending a little more money to renovate his loft, which sits atop his two-story house in a leafy neighborhood of Baghdad. It would run him about $4,000.","8":"The security company said the plans were at a \u201cvery early\u201d stage, and it could not say what kind of training would be carried out at the base, which will be built with a Chinese state-backed company. Over the past two years, the Chinese government has been running a sweeping campaign to \u201csinicize\u201d the Xinjiang area, which is home to a large Muslim population belonging to the ethnic Uighur minority. It has created \u201cvocational training camps\u201d to \u201cde-radicalize\u201d people it calls Islamic extremists. Frontier Services Group signed a deal on Jan. 11 to build a training center in the Caohu industrial park in the Xinjiang city of Tumxuk, the company said in a Chinese-language statement on its website.\u00a0 The signing ceremony was attended by officials from Tumxuk, a city controlled by a Xinjiang farming and paramilitary group known as the \u201cbingtuan,\u201d and from CITIC Guoan Construction, part of an enormous state-run conglomerate. The deal was first reported by the Reuters news agency, and the statement disappeared from the company\u2019s website soon after, although a cached copy can still be viewed. A spokesman for the company, Marc Cohen, said the statement was posted on the website by mistake, and he did not answer questions about what kind of training would be done at the center. The group would invest $6 million in the center, which would be able to train 8,000 people a year, according to the state-run Foshan News Network, which reported on the signing ceremony. \u00a0The now-deleted photo of the signing ceremony on Frontier\u2019s website showed Chinese officials but did not show Prince, who is the company\u2019s executive director and deputy chairman. Prince, the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, is a former Navy SEAL who founded Blackwater, a military contractor that was controversial for its actions in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u00a0 A former Blackwater security guard was sentenced to life in prison and three others to 30-year terms in 2015 for killing 14 unarmed civilians in a Baghdad traffic circle in 2007. Frontier, through its spokesman, tried to distance Prince from the Xinjiang project. \u201cMr. Prince is a minority shareholder in FSG and deputy chairman. He had no knowledge or involvement whatsoever with this preliminary memorandum regarding the company\u2019s activity in Xinjiang,\u201d Cohen said in an email.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAny potential investment of this nature would require the knowledge and input of each FSG board member and a formal board resolution,\u201d he said. Frontier, which is headquartered in Hong Kong and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has focused its business on China. It has an office in Beijing but also in the Xinjiang city of Kashgar. In 2017, Frontier opened the International Security Defense College in Beijing, which it said aimed to become \u201cthe largest private security training school in China\u201d but was meant\u00a0to protect Chinese enterprises in Africa and Asia rather than support China\u2019s domestic police or military. The company is also scouting for business in the countries that China is targeting for its \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative, which is building infrastructure and spreading China\u2019s influence around the world. It has inked deals in countries including Kazakhstan and Myanmar, as well as across Africa. In December, Frontier received a license to operate a security business in Cambodia, and it will soon start offering \u201cservices such as cash escort, airport security, VIP close protection in Cambodia,\u201d the company said on its website. Xinjiang borders the central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, making it the Chinese gateway to Europe and a key stop on the Belt and Road. But it has also been the site of an all-encompassing crackdown. Hundreds of thousands of Uighurs have been interned in the barbed-wire-ringed camps, where they are forced to speak Mandarin Chinese and pledge allegiance to the Communist Party. Western governments and human rights advocates have said the camps are prisons and that the state is trying to dilute Uighur language and culture, while strengthening its control over the region.\u00a0 The U.S.\u00a0Senate is considering putting sanctions on China over its mass internment and indoctrination program. The United Nations says as many as 1 million people have been detained there, but a State Department official last month put the number as high as 2 million. \u201cReports suggest that most of those detained are not being charged with crimes and their families have little to no information about their whereabouts,\u201d said Scott Busby, deputy assistant secretary of state for human rights, according to the Hill. \u201cFormer detainees who have reached safety have spoken of relentless indoctrination and harsh conditions. For example, praying and other religious practices are forbidden,\u201d he said. \u201cThe apparent goal is to force detainees to renounce Islam and embrace the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d","9":"The ability of Internet users to spread a video of Friday\u2019s slaughter in New Zealand marked a triumph \u2014 however appalling \u2014 of human ingenuity over computerized systems designed to block troubling images of violence and hate. People celebrating the mosque attacks that left 50 people dead were able to keep posting and reposting videos on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter despite the websites\u2019 use of largely automated systems powered by artificial intelligence to block them. Clips of the attack stayed up for many hours and, in some cases, days. This failure has highlighted Silicon Valley\u2019s struggles to police platforms that are massively lucrative yet also persistently vulnerable to outside manipulation despite years of promises to do better. Friday\u2019s uncontrolled spread of horrific videos \u2014 a propaganda coup for those espousing hateful ideologies \u2014 also raised questions about whether social media can be made safer without undermining business models that rely on the speed and volume of content uploaded by users worldwide. In Washington and Silicon Valley, the incident crystallized growing concerns about the extent to which government and market forces have failed to check the power of social media. \u201cIt\u2019s an uncontrollable digital Frankenstein,\u201d said Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology. Those pushing videos of Friday\u2019s attack made small alterations \u2014 such as changing the color tones or length \u2014 of the shooting video originally live-streamed by the alleged killer himself through his Facebook page. Such tricks often were enough to evade detection by artificial-intelligence systems designed by some of the world\u2019s most technologically advanced companies to block such content. But for all of the investment in such technology, even more has gone into making social media platforms powerful springboards for delivering images, sounds and words to as many people as possible \u2014 for the purpose of generating advertising revenue that fuels profits measured in the tens of billions of dollars each year. \u201cThe only good thing that\u2019s come out of this is that it laid bare the lie that the big tech companies can solve this problem with AI because they really cannot,\u201d said Cathy O\u2019Neil, author of \u201cWeapons of Math Destruction,\u201d about the societal impact of algorithms. \u201cNobody knows how to counteract this stuff. They should stop pretending they do.\" Mia Garlick, the head of communications and policy for Facebook in Australia and New Zealand, said the company would \u201cwork around the clock to remove violating content using a combination of technology and people.\u201d Garlick said the company is also now even removing edited versions of the video that do not feature graphic violence. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment Monday, and Reddit declined to comment, but both have described working hard over several days to remove objectionable content from the shooting. For Reddit, that includes forums named \u201cgore\u201d and \u201cwatchpeopledie.\u201d A YouTube executive, in an exclusive interview with The Washington Post, acknowledged that the platform\u2019s systems were overwhelmed and promised to make improvements. \u201cWe\u2019ve made progress, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have a lot of work ahead of us, and this incident has shown that,\u201d said Neal Mohan, YouTube\u2019s chief product officer. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have scrambled before and largely failed to contain odious content on their platforms. Nor is this the first time killers have used social media to deliver images of their crimes. But nobody before had staged a mass-casualty attack in a way so geared to spreading it virally across social media. Many critics worry that because it has happened once, it almost certainly will happen again. Micah Schaffer, a technology policy consultant and a former director at YouTube, said that over the past decade social media companies have designed software to more effectively promote content to broad audiences. Those design choices, he said, have made it easier for content to spread online. \u201cBack in 2007, when I was at YouTube, if a video on the homepage was a success, that meant getting hundreds of thousands of views,\u201d Schaffer said. \u201cThese videos were handpicked, and we scrutinized each one. Compare that today to the recommendation algorithm sending millions of views to videos with no human intervention. To me, that\u2019s just irresponsible.\u201d Those who study social media say that slowing the spread of appalling videos might require the companies to change or limit some features that help spread stimulating content. Those include powerful search and recommendation algorithms, nearly instantaneous uploads and autoplay. The companies\u2019 losing battle to keep content in check already is having financial consequences. Facebook\u2019s stock recorded its steepest drop of the year, falling more than 3 percent on Monday. In a note to clients, Needham & Co. analyst Laura Martin blamed the negative effects of \u201chorrific images ... that are technologically difficult to block at the 100% level and which hurt [Facebook\u2019s] brand.\u201d Shares in Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, slid less than 1 percent. The day of the New Zealand shooting, authorities say, the admitted gunman, Brenton Tarrant, posted on the anonymous message board 8chan that he would \u201clive stream the attack via facebook\u201d and included a link to Facebook and a number of other sites where an anti-Muslim manifesto and other documents were stored. Within minutes of this announcement, a flood of anonymous posters were cheering him on and rallying to save and re-upload the video widely online to give it maximum distribution: \u201cI am downloading it\u201d; \u201cStream saved\u201d; \u201cSAVE THIS S*** NOW\u201d; \u201cGRAB THEM WHILE YOU CAN.\u201d One poster wrote that the gunman had \u201cdelivered\u201d on his pledge: \u201cI just saw him kill so many\u201d people, using an obscene term for Muslims. \u201cNice shootin,\u201d another wrote. 8chan did not respond to requests for comment. \u201cHuman nature has always had evil and horrific elements to it. But we\u2019re not asking for the platforms to solve humanity \u2014 that\u2019s not the issue,\u201d said Mike Ananny, an associate professor of communication at the University of Southern California. \u201cThese companies have the advertising monopolies, the eyeball-attention monopolies. \u2026 We have to expect them to be a much more responsible player than they are.\u201d When the tech giants want to block a troubling video, they add the original to a vast internal blacklist so that their systems can quickly recognize whenever a copy of it resurfaces. This type of \u201chashing\u201d technology is a key reason companies can automatically flag or block child pornography, terrorist propaganda and copyrighted material before it spreads widely online. But their algorithms depend on pattern recognition, and even the most sophisticated systems are easily deceived. Anyone hoping to spread an otherwise blocked video \u2014 such as movie pirates and creators of extremist videos \u2014 can cut out shorter snippets or change the video\u2019s playing speed, coloring, sound or video size, then upload it again. Facebook said that it blocked 80 percent of the New Zealand first-person shooting videos from being uploaded within the first 24 hours but that roughly 300,000 videos slipped through \u2014 a showing that put them within reach of millions of people online. U.S. law largely shields major tech platforms from being held liable for the content users post to their sites. Silicon Valley sees this decades-old legal shield \u2014 known as Section 230 for the provision in law it represents \u2014 as the reason that major social media sites have flourished without having to defend themselves against lawsuits. But frustrated lawmakers from both parties increasingly are wondering whether the time has come to craft new legislation to curb digital ills such as hate speech and terrorist propaganda. \u201cI think that we absolutely need to have a hearing and understand exactly what happened in the situation to determine the best solutions to prevent it from happening in the future,\u201d said Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.). \u201cWhat happened in New Zealand is horrifying and heartbreaking, and that video should never be available online.\u201d But a chief architect of Section 230, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), urged caution. While saying that tech giants must be \u201cfar more vigorous about identifying, fingerprinting and blocking content and individuals who incite hate and violence,\u201d Wyden said that eliminating the section could have unintended consequences for free speech. \u201cSo often in the wake of horrible events politicians grasp for knee-jerk responses that won\u2019t solve real problems, and may even make them worse,\u201d he added in a statement. European policymakers have been more aggressive in holding technology giants responsible for what appears on their platforms. Germany, for example, began enforcing a law last year that requires social media sites to remove instances of hate speech within 24 hours. The European Union broadly has proposed rules that would give Facebook, YouTube and others an hour to remove terrorist content \u2014 or face hefty fines. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg told congressional lawmakers last year that human moderators and AI systems would help the company solve some of its most intractable problems, including automatically flagging harmful videos. But AI researchers have said that view doesn\u2019t factor in the vast number of ways in which automated systems fail to come even close to human ability, including in understanding context and common sense. Today\u2019s algorithms excel at certain tasks but are what AI engineers call frustratingly \u201cbrittle,\u201d with even small changes to their tasks or training data quickly leading them to collapse. Stephen Merity, a machine learning researcher in San Francisco, said tech companies do not want to use more drastic measures, such as tougher restrictions on who can upload or bigger investments in content-moderation teams, because of how they could alter their sites\u2019 usability or business model. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to do that, so they make these wild promises,\u201d he said. But \u201cyou can\u2019t bank on future magical innovations,\u201d Merity said. \u201cWe\u2019re past the point of ceding the benefit of the doubt to these tech companies.\u201d","10":"THE LIGHTBULB U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) holds a hamburger during a Congressional Western Caucus news conference at the U.S. Capitol\u00a0on Feb. 27, 2019. (Congressional Western Caucus) Dozens of Democrats are demanding all sectors of the U.S. economy drive down greenhouse gas emissions with their Green New Deal resolution. The nearly overwhelming response so far from\u00a0Republicans in Congress:\u00a0Where's the beef?\u00a0 Republicans are insisting that their Democratic colleagues want to take away that American classic -- the hamburger -- as part of their resolution to prepare for the effects of climate change.\u00a0 Whether on Capitol Hill, on social media, or at political conferences, Republicans have made meat\u00a0a central part of their messaging against the resolution\u00a0introduced last month by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.)\u00a0and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.).\u00a0 Rep. Rob Bishop of Utah, the top Republican on the Natural\u00a0Resources Committee, held up a hamburger during a news\u00a0conference Wednesday railing against the Green New Deal.\u00a0\"If this goes through,\"\u00a0Bishop said before taking a bite, \"this will be outlawed.\u201d And Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who chairs of the powerful Freedom Caucus, joked Thursday during a speech at\u00a0the\u00a0Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland that \u201cChick-fil-A stock will go way up\u201d because Democrats are \"trying to get rid of all the cows.\" Freshman Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee\u00a0warned in an op-ed in Nashville's daily newspaper,\u00a0the Tennessean, that if\u00a0\u201cthe Green New Dealers have their way, cows would be effectively banned.\u201d Her GOP colleague, John Barrasso of Wyoming,\u00a0who chairs\u00a0the\u00a0Environment and Public Works Committee, similarly went to the stake for cattlemen in his state during a speech last month on\u00a0the floor of the Senate.\u201cSay goodbye to dairy, to beef, to family farms, to ranches,\u201d the senator said. \u00a0\u201cAmerican favorites like cheeseburgers and milkshakes\u00a0would become a thing of the past. Millions of American workers will lose their jobs.\u201d And of course, there is President Trump, who claimed on Twitter that the Green New Deal would \u201cpermanently eliminate\u201d cows. The Green New Deal's supporters have pointed out that\u00a0there is no meat on the bone to that\u00a0criticism: The\u00a0resolution itself does not mention beef, burgers or anything similar.\u00a0 The rhetoric is among the latest instances of those on the political right fixating on\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez as they search for a winning message in 2020 by casting the Green New Deal as a socialist fantasy. Every Democratic senator running\u00a0for president\u00a0has so far supported the freshman representative's climate resolution.\u00a0 Republicans are latching onto a comment made by Ocasio-Cortez during an interview on Showtime\u2019s \u201cDesus & Mero\u201d last week, which during which she\u00a0explained that she wants to \u201caddress factory farming.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not to say you get rid of agriculture,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say we\u2019re going to force everybody to go vegan or anything crazy like that. But it\u2019s to say, listen, we\u2019ve got to address factory farming. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\u201d Democrats say the they're-taking-away-your-hamburgers argument is a stretch.\u00a0 \u201cThis whole 'Chicken Little' approach, I don't think it's going to work,\u201d Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who co-sponsored the Green New Deal and leads the\u00a0Natural Resources panel, said of the GOP talking point.\u00a0\u201cThe\u00a0sky is not falling. There is serious legislation to be put together here that is going to require some balance.\u201d Right now, the\u00a0Green New Deal is just a nonbinding\u00a0resolution \u2014 not a bill that would have legal teeth if passed\u00a0\u2014 that sets out a series of\u00a0goals for the United States so that the nation can achieve \u201cnet-zero greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\u00a0 The resolution's aim for the electricity sector, for example, is relatively\u00a0clear\u00a0even if it would be very hard to achieve: Get 100 percent of the nation's power from \u201cclean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources\u201d within a decade. For\u00a0agriculture, the goal is a little vaguer: Work with farmers to\u00a0drive down emissions from farms \u201cas much as is technologically feasible.\u201d\u00a0 To\u00a0win broad support among Democrats, the Green New Deal resolution was designed to not explicitly ban anything in particular \u2014 whether it be burgers, ice cream, airplanes or even coal.\u00a0 \u201cI'm surprised that Republicans have left out apple pie,\u201d Robert Hockett, a Cornell University professor who was\u00a0as an outside adviser to Ocasio-Cortez on the resolution, wrote by email.\u00a0\u201cWhat it does do is to lay out goals to make alternatives to carbon-based energy so affordable that they simply out-compete carbon and thereby become more attractive to consumers than carbon. \" Yet Republicans are still pointing to an erroneous fact sheet published \u2014 but later\u00a0withdrawn \u2014 by\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez's office that tried to make a subtle point about the difference between bringing emissions of climate-warming gases down to zero from all sources and bringing the overall net emissions down to zero. \u201cWe set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren\u2019t sure that we\u2019ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast,\u201d it read. Even after Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats disavowed that document, the \u201cfarting cows\u201d line took on a life of its own among conservatives such as former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who tried turning it into a punchline.\u00a0 In reality, agriculture does account\u00a0for\u00a0a significant portion of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 about 9 percent\u00a0in 2016, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. And while much of those climate-warming emissions do come from gassy cattle, both Republicans and Democrats are focusing on the wrong end of the animal. Most of those emissions come not from cows'\u00a0flatulence, but from their burps. Correction: The original version of this story stated\u00a0Marsha Blackburn represents Missouri in the Senate.

Stone Jr. appeared Jan. 25 on the steps of a federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Stone, a close friend of President Trump, had just been released on a $250,000 bond after being charged with obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Proclaiming his innocence, Stone struck a victory sign pose, mimicking his personal hero, the late president Richard M. Nixon. Then reporters lobbed questions. One particular exchange struck historians as particularly strange. \u201cIf you were convicted,\" a reporter asked, \u201cdo you think the president would pardon you?\u201d \u201cThe only person I have advocated a pardon for,\" Stone answered, \"is Marcus Garvey.\u201d Marcus Garvey? As in Marcus Mosiah Garvey, the legendary black nationalist leader who nearly a century ago inspired liberation movements in colonized Africa and the Caribbean? Garvey who advocated self-governance, economic and political empowerment, and a \u201cBack to Africa\u201d movement for black people in the diaspora? \u201cWho would have imagined Roger Stone would be involved in this?\" said Michael K. Fauntroy, associate professor of political science and acting director of the Ronald Walters Leadership and Public Policy Center at Howard University. \"Stone has been a master manipulator throughout his career. That he would attach himself so closely with Marcus Garvey is unusual, to say the least. Marcus Garvey, for those who know him, is a hero and a figure of historical significance. He was clearly targeted by the government for his beliefs and actions. Maybe Stone sees some kinship in that regard. \u201c One of Garvey\u2019s sons, Julius Garvey, a vascular surgeon who lives in New York, said he was also surprised by the campaign by Stone to pardon his father but did not object to it. \u201cI thought it was interesting,\u201d Julius Garvey said. \u201cThe more people who would like to see [a pardon] happen, the better.\u201d Julius Garvey has long argued that his father was targeted by then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s \u201cobsession to neutralize the rise of a black liberator.\u201d Julius Garvey led the \u201cJustice4Garvey\u201d campaign to exonerate his father.  In 2011, the Obama administration rejected a posthumous pardon for Garvey, and in 2017, Barack Obama left office without granting a pardon to Garvey. In an interview with The Washington Post, Stone said he became fascinated by Garvey after picking up a biography in a New York bookstore. He does not remember when or the name of the book, but a friend had recommended that he read about Garvey. After finishing the book, Stone recalled deciding: \u201cMarcus Garvey is one of my political heroes.\u201d Stone was captivated by Garvey\u2019s battles with the federal government and was convinced that Garvey was targeted because of his race and because he preached black capitalism, entrepreneurship and empowerment. \u201cHe was railroaded by the FBI,\u201d Stone said. In the past two years, as Stone\u2019s actions during the 2016 presidential campaign came under scrutiny by federal investigators, Stone said he has thought of Garvey as a kind of kindred spirit. Stone has sought to portray himself as a victim of an \u201cout-of-control\u201d special counsel\u2019s office conducting a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and bent on toppling President Trump. His detractors have portrayed him as a traitorous schemer who allegedly served as a conduit between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization that published stolen emails that damaged the campaign of Trump\u2019s opponent, Hillary Clinton. Stone vehemently denies coordinating with WikiLeaks. When Trump won the election, Stone said he sent a letter to Trump, whom he has known and advised for nearly four decades, asking the president to pardon Garvey. But Stone said he has never directly discussed Garvey\u2019s case with the president. In October, Stone also wrote a column on his website StoneColdTruth.com calling on Trump to pardon Garvey. \u201cI think it is vital that the President use his pardon authority to clear the names of people who were convicted of non-violent crimes for largely race-based or political reasons,\u201d Stone wrote. \u201cThere is no greater example than that of Marcus Garvey.\u201d Stone regards his campaign for Garvey as a way of countering claims on social media and television calling him a racist. In 2012, Stone came under fire for tweeting that the liberal broadcaster Roland Martin is \u201ca stupid negro.\u201d Martin called Stone a \u201csuperficial, petulant, racist child\u201d in an interview with The Post. Stone said he regrets the Martin remarks and points to his support for reforming the criminal justice system and statements he has made urging Republicans to do a better job of outreach to African Americans. Stone said that he has also advocated support for affirmative action, in defiance of opposition from fellow Republicans. He has for many years believed that Nixon did not receive enough credit for being an early supporter of affirmative action. Last year, Trump granted a posthumous pardon to boxer Jack Johnson, the nation\u2019s first black heavyweight champion, who spent almost a year in prison after being targeted by Jim Crow-era prosecutors for marrying two white women. Asked if Trump is considering pardoning Garvey, the White House responded by providing its guidelines for how it reviews petitions for pardons and commutations of sentences. Garvey, who was born in 1887 in St. Ann\u2019s Bay, Jamaica, founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in 1914. It quickly grew into \u201cthe largest mass movement in African-American history,\u201d according to the National Humanities Center, with 700 branches in 38 states by the early 1920s. In 1918, Garvey established the Negro World newspaper and a year later bought an auditorium in Harlem. He called it Liberty Hall, where thousands flocked to hear him speak. \u201cBlack people are subjects of ostracism,\u201d Garvey said in a 1921 speech, to thunderous applause. \u201cIt is sad that our humanity has shown us no more love \u2014 no greater sympathy than we are experiencing. Wheresoever you go throughout the world, the black man is discarded as ostracized, as relegated to the lowest of things \u2014 social, political and economical.\u201d Garvey preached that the problem could be solved only through black pride and self-reliance. To carry black people and cargo back to Africa, Garvey launched a steamship line, which he called the Black Star Line. The company sold stock for $5 a share. This sale, along with Garvey\u2019s rhetoric and following, attracted government attention. Garvey was targeted by Hoover. In documents released later, the FBI acknowledged that it began investigating Garvey to find reasons to \u201cdeport him as an undesirable alien.\u201d In 1921, Garvey\u2019s steamship company announced to stockholders it would buy two more ships. But a newspaper that competed with the Negro World published an investigation claiming the U.S. Department of Commerce had no record of the ships. Garvey, his treasurer and secretary were arrested and charged with using the U.S. Postal Service to defraud stockholders. Garvey\u2019s lawyer, William C. Matthews, urged him to plead guilty. Instead, Garvey fired Matthews and defended himself. On June 21, 1923, after a month-long trial, Garvey was convicted of mail fraud and sentenced to five years in prison. Then-President Calvin Coolidge commuted Garvey\u2019s sentence after he served three years. Garvey was deported to Jamaica, where he is regarded as a national hero. He died in London in 1940. \u201cWe believe Marcus Garvey was the subject of racial and political animus,\u201d said Anthony T. Pierce, a partner at Akin Gump law firm, who filed a pardon petition June 24, 2016, while Obama was president. The petition argued that Garvey was innocent, that he did not receive a fair trial, that a witness perjured himself and that the judge sided with the prosecution. \u201cThe Obama administration, both at the Justice Department level and the White House declined,\u201d Pierce said this week. \u201cWe renewed the effort with Trump.\u201d But, Pierce added, \u201cRoger Stone is not involved in our effort.\u201d Stone said he connected with Garvey\u2019s swagger and style. Stone writes frequently about fashion, publishes an annual best- and worst-dressed list, and is known for his hand-tailored Cab Calloway-style suits and vintage hats. Garvey was \u201ca helluva dresser,\u201d Stone said. Pardoning Garvey, Stone said, would be a good look for the man who now occupies the Oval Office. \u201cI think it would send a signal,\u201d Stone said, \u201ca signal about equality and justice.\u201d Read more Retropolis: Martin Luther King Jr. met Malcolm X just once.

The latest idea to tack on an increase in the nation\u2019s borrowing limit to discussions over Trump\u2019s demand for $5.7 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall divided Republicans and was immediately rejected by Democrats, a less-than-promising development on the eve of congressional negotiators\u2019 first meeting. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sink the whole thing,\u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said when asked about the flurry of proposals by her colleagues. Still, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump ally, and others worked to nudge a bipartisan group of lawmakers toward including a debt-limit hike, hoping to avoid another shutdown in midFebruary when funding expires as well as a market-rattling showdown over the nation\u2019s debt. \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough cliffhangers, and that\u2019s the point I\u2019m trying to make,\u201d Graham said. The growing debate over the committee\u2019s scope underscored the anxiety that has gripped Capitol Hill in the wake of the longest shutdown in history, which ended Friday on its 35th day. Most Republicans are now eager to avoid another shutdown, due to the political fallout they have endured in polls, which show a majority of Americans blaming Trump and the GOP for the standoff. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has been cautious, said Tuesday, \u201cI\u2019m for whatever works, which means avoiding a shutdown and avoiding the president feeling he should declare a national emergency.\u201d But, McConnell added, \u201cExactly how to do that, as you all know, has been quite challenging. \u2026 I\u2019m for it narrow or broader. I\u2019m for whatever works that prevents the level of dysfunction we\u2019ve seen on full display here the last month.\u201d The suggestions \u2014 which also included spending restrictions and protections for young undocumented immigrants as part of a broader pact \u2014 complicated the path ahead for the committee of 17 lawmakers charged with coming up with a spending deal to stave off another shutdown Feb. 15. The bipartisan group, which was created as part of the deal struck Friday, is made up of members of the House and Senate Appropriations committees, lawmakers more inclined to reach for compromise than stake out hard-line positions on immigration or other issues. It will meet for the first time Wednesday afternoon at the Capitol. The White House mostly kept its distance from the committee on Tuesday, but several senators said they expected Trump and administration officials to engage with members this week \u2014 a move that lawmakers said would be likely to roil the already fragile congressional negotiations. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be helpful,\u201d Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said of Trump\u2019s potential involvement, adding, \u201cLindsey has a laundry list every hour. I don\u2019t think we can take any of them seriously at this point.\u201d And the possibility remained that Trump could declare a national emergency at the border, using his executive powers to secure funding for his promised wall without congressional approval, White House officials said, even as Republicans and Democrats urged him to hold off. Multiple Republican lawmakers and aides said they anticipate a meeting Thursday at the White House between Trump and Republican members of the bipartisan group, although details remained uncertain. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Trump should stay out of the negotiations. \u201cWhen he mixes in, it\u2019s a formula for failure,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d ask President Trump, \u2018Let Congress deal with it on its own.\u2019\u201d Schumer also dismissed what he called the \u201cadded elements\u201d being mentioned by Graham and others. The possible add-ons to a deal arose partly because it remained unclear to lawmakers in both parties what Trump will accept as the price to keep the government open when the short-term funding bill expires. Republicans\u2019 starting point for talks is $5.7 billion for the border wall, but they are aware that in a negotiation with Democrats they will end up with a lower number. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to have to come down if we\u2019re actually looking for a true compromise,\u201d Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said. \u201cBoth sides are going to have to give.\u201d Two senior GOP Senate aides said the committee members would push for the $5.7 billion figure, but know that they will have to compromise on the details of how funds are allocated as Democrats are firmly against a border wall but are willing to talk about what one of the aides called \u201cthe gray area of border security where technology and steel fences can be called different things\u201d by each party as they \u201ctry to save face.\u201d Although Democrats have remained steadfastly opposed to funding Trump\u2019s wall, several have indicated openness to border barriers of some kind in recent days, which Republicans viewed as a positive sign and potential opening for compromise. Bipartisan congressional spending bills for years have funded new and rebuilt levee walls, fences and bollards of various types along the U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cI think we\u2019ve consistently said that we do not support a medieval border wall from sea to shining sea,\u201d said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), who chairs the House Democratic Caucus. \u201cHowever, we are willing to support fencing where it makes sense, but it should be done in an evidence-based fashion.\u201d But House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.), who will chair the bipartisan conference committee, refused in an interview Tuesday to say whether Democrats would support border barriers of any kind. \u201cLook, smart border security is not overly reliant on physical barriers, and they\u2019re not cost-effective compared to better technology and more personnel,\u201d Lowey said. She also dismissed the idea of adding issues like the debt limit to their deliberations. \u201cForget it. Forget it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have enough issues to deal with seriously, and we want to work in a bipartisan way. I have no intention of complicating the discussions.\u201d Congress has suspended the nation\u2019s borrowing limit, often called the debt ceiling, until March. If it is not raised or suspended again by March 1, the U.S. Treasury would have to implement cash-saving tactics to pay its bills for a few months before it runs out of money. Once the money is gone, Treasury would be unable to pay all its bills on time, which could lead to a financial crisis and a default on the government\u2019s obligations. This could cause a spike in interest rates, a surge in unemployment, and a stock market crash. Fitch Ratings warned this month that a shutdown coupled with a battle over the debt limit might damage the country\u2019s Triple-A credit rating. A downgrade in the U.S. credit rating would make borrowing costlier for companies and American households, according to Moody\u2019s, one of the big three credit rating agencies, along with Fitch and Standard & Poor\u2019s. Graham, who had dinner with Trump and other GOP officials on Monday in Washington, told CNN on Tuesday that he discussed the debt limit with the president. Another issue that could vex the committee is the fate of young undocumented immigrants. Graham on Tuesday called on his colleagues to protect them as part of a deal and warned in a tweet that they will not \u201cget legal status unless we address some of the causes of a broken immigration system.\u201d But many conservatives are wary of following Graham\u2019s advice, and commentators such as Ann Coulter have warned Trump of outrage among his core supporters if he moves in that direction. Nevertheless, some top Trump officials, such as senior adviser Jared Kushner, continue to pursue a sweeping agreement that would include protections for those immigrants. Kushner has been working with the conservative groups aligned with the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch to discuss next steps. White House officials, such as legislative director Shahira Knight, plan to meet with moderate Republicans and Democrats who are part of the Problem Solvers\u2019 Caucus on Wednesday to gauge their interest in supporting aspects of barrier funding as the committee meets, according to an individual briefed on the group\u2019s plans who was not authorized to speak publicly. Trump long claimed Mexico would pay for the wall before he started trying to get U.S. taxpayers to do so. Tuesday also saw further discussion of legislation to effectively ban government shutdowns, reflecting the desire in both parties to avoid another prolonged shuttering of federal agencies. McConnell expressed openness about considering legislation but acknowledged that there is not yet consensus on the details of such legislation. \u201cThere certainly would be no education in the third kick of a mule,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI don\u2019t like shutdowns. I don\u2019t think they work for anybody, and I hope they will be avoided. I\u2019m open to anything we could agree on, on a bipartisan basis.\u201d Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) have proposed their own bills. Portman\u2019s is more conservative in nature, calling on federal funding to gradually decline if Congress is unable to pass a funding package.

In a court filing made public last week, Toronto attorney Darryl Levitt says that the spy, whose real name is Aharon Almog-Assouline, \u201cbears a striking similarity\u201d to a man he identified as an alleged Black Cube operative. Levitt says he was targeted because of his involvement in a long-running legal battle between two Canadian private equity firms, Catalyst Capital and West Face Capital. Previous media reports have hinted at a link between Almog-Assouline and Black Cube, but Levitt\u2019s Feb. 21 claim before Ontario\u2019s Superior Court of Justice is the first attempt to substantiate the connection by requesting receipts and surveillance footage. Black Cube has previously acknowledged doing work on the Catalyst case, which centers on allegations of stock market manipulation. In an email, Black Cube\u2019s Canadian lawyer, John Adair, said he had no comment on Levitt\u2019s filing. Almog-Assouline also didn\u2019t immediately return messages Wednesday. Levitt made his claim after reading the AP\u2019s account of how Almog-Assouline was caught trying to extract information from an employee of Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity research group, at the Peninsula Hotel in New York on Jan. 24. Levitt declined to comment for this article, but in his 115-page filing he said the photograph published by AP bore a powerful resemblance to a man he knew as Victor Petrov. Petrov masqueraded as a London consultant and invited Levitt to Toronto\u2019s Hazelton Hotel under false pretenses on Oct. 11, 2017. Levitt said in the court filing that he was asked \u201ca series of increasingly suspicious questions which appeared designed to elicit confidential and\/or embarrassing information.\u201d Almog-Assouline hasn\u2019t answered any questions from the AP since last month\u2019s ambush, when \u2014 while still masquerading as a French consultant named Michel Lambert \u2014 he denied working for Black Cube. He was unmasked shortly after sitting down to lunch with Citizen Lab\u2019s John Scott-Railton and asking pointed questions about his group\u2019s role in documenting the use of Israeli hacking tools to spy on slain Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s inner circle. The Lambert and Petrov aliases appeared to use some of the same cover stories during their undercover operations. Levitt said Petrov boasted of his \u201cenormous experience\u201d in Africa; Lambert told Scott-Railton he knew the continent well. The names of their fictitious companies sounded similar: Petrov said he worked for KWE Consulting; Lambert said his employer was CPW Consulting. Neither company was found in corporate databases examined by the AP or at addresses visited by reporters. Some of the small talk used by the Lambert and Petrov personas appears to be drawn from Almog-Assouline\u2019s real life experiences. Lambert claimed Morocco as his native country; a former colleague said that\u2019s where Almog-Assouline lived until his move to Israel as a teenager. Lambert had also claimed to be a fan of Punch cigars; on WhatsApp, the mobile messaging service, Almog-Assouline\u2019s profile photo consisted of a Punch cigar logo which he deleted after reporters began sending him messages. Almog-Assouline had served on the municipal council of the upscale Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hasharon between 2013 and 2018, where former associates said it was an open secret that Almog-Assouline was a veteran of Israel\u2019s intelligence services. Fellow councilman Marc Mimouni said Almog-Assouline served in the Mossad, the Jewish state\u2019s storied external espionage agency. The Israeli prime minister\u2019s office, which oversees the Mossad, didn\u2019t return a message seeking comment. Mimouni said he didn\u2019t think Almog-Assouline had it in him to be a dirty trickster, saying he was a good friend and a fun, friendly \u201cteam player.\u201d \u201cThe man I know gave the impression of a patriot who would not do anything bad for the country,\u201d Mimouni said. Others familiar with Almog-Assouline take a different view. Ramat Hasharon\u2019s former deputy mayor, Nurit Avner, said Almog-Assouline had ridden her coattails into local politics and then ditched her party after the pair were elected, a move she described as a cynical betrayal. \u201cI had a bad experience with the man,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing connected to him would surprise me.\u201d ___ Aron Heller reported from Ramat Hasharon, Israel. ___ Online: ___","14":"\u201cAll men are created equal\u201d is America\u2019s founding creed, the reaffirmation that America is not defined by race or place of birth or any other outward characteristic, but rather by fidelity to the rule of law, democracy and the opportunity to pursue one\u2019s dreams. Unfortunately, a high percentage of one major political party doesn\u2019t buy that. The recent Public Religion Research Institute poll finds: Overall, nearly half of Americans generally support a racially and ethnically diverse vision of the United States, although there are moderate divisions by race. When asked to put themselves on a scale, where one end is the statement, \u201cI would prefer the U.S. to be a nation made up of people from all over the world,\u201d and the other end is the statement, \u201cI would prefer the U.S. to be a nation primarily made up of people from Western European heritage,\u201d 47% of Americans mostly agree with the first statement, while less than one in ten (9%) Americans mostly agree with the second statement, and 39% place themselves in the middle of the scale. There are also stark political divisions on this issue. Nearly two-thirds (65%) of Democrats, compared to only three in ten (29%) Republicans, mostly prefer a country with racial and ethnic diversity. Republicans are nearly twice as likely as Democrats to state a preference for a Western European majority in the country (13% vs. 7%). Additionally, over half (56%) of Republicans place themselves somewhere in the middle on this issue, compared to one-quarter (25%) of Democrats. Independents closely resemble Americans in general on this question. But America is a racially and ethnically diverse country, you say. Yes, and that may explain the high degree of anger and sense of alienation many Republicans who supported Donald Trump feel. Less than a third of them believe America should be diverse. One criticism of Trump supporters\u2019 immigration stance has been that they are not merely opposed to illegal immigration but to immigration of black and brown people. The poll gives some support for that conclusion. For them, Trump\u2019s criticism of \u201cs---hole\u201d countries is a sign he understands their beef with immigration. This negative view of diversity permeates many Republicans\u2019 thinking. For example, \u201cDemocrats are likeliest to say that the U.S.\u2019s diversity makes the country stronger. More than three-quarters (77%) of Democrats say that the country\u2019s diverse population makes it stronger, while only 55% of independents and 51% of Republicans agree. Notably, one in five (20%) Republicans say that the U.S.\u2019s diverse population makes it weaker.\u201d On one hand, all political groups think our creed\/beliefs in our Constitution are what most define us. \u201cOverwhelming majorities of Republicans, independents, and Democrats agree that respecting American political institutions and laws (98%, 85%, 91%, respectively), believing in individual freedoms such as freedom of speech (96%, 88%, 93%, respectively), and accepting people of diverse racial and religious backgrounds (86%, 82%, 92%, respectively), are somewhat or very important for being truly American.\u201d But PRRI also finds large majorities of Republicans think it is somewhat or very important to be born in America and believe in God if one wants to be \u201ctruly American.\u201d Republicans by and large don\u2019t put too much stock in religious diversity (i.e., religious freedom). \u201cOver half (54%) of Democrats, compared to only one in ten (12%) Republicans, mostly prefer religious diversity. By contrast, four in ten (40%) Republicans state a preference for a Christian majority, compared to only 14% of Democrats. A plurality (45%) of Republicans and nearly one in three (29%) Democrats place themselves in the middle of this scale. Independents closely resemble Americans in general on this question.\u201d The rejection of a pluralistic, multiracial democracy by so many Republicans should be deeply disturbing. It also explains the polarization on so many political issues. If one party doesn\u2019t really think that those not from Western European heritage (i.e. ,nonwhite people) should be here, reaching consensus on immigration and even child separation seems nearly impossible. If one party thinks religious diversity is a threat to America\u2019s identity, good luck reaching consensus on issues such as religious accommodation, the Muslim ban and more. (That said, one interesting part of the poll finds that there are supermajorities of Republicans and Democrats who favor a long list of policies, e.g. protection for those with preexisting conditions, treating rather than punishing drug users, getting rid of mandatory-minimum sentences and allowing those who\u2019ve served prison sentences to regain the right to vote.) We should seriously consider why so many Americans fundamentally reject our founding creed and where our institutions have failed to convey and propagate those fundamental beliefs. Ronald Reagan famously said, \u201cAmerica represents something universal in the human spirit. I received a letter not long ago from a man who said, \u2018You can go to Japan to live, but you cannot become Japanese. You can go to France to live and not become a Frenchman. You can go to live in Germany or Turkey, and you won\u2019t become a German or a Turk.\u2019 But then he added, \u2018Anybody from any corner of the world can come to America to live and become an American.\u2019 \u201d Today, an alarming number of Republicans would say: Not so fast.

Kelvin took a voluntary leave of absence in December after more than 200 employees released a petition saying Ted Baker\u2019s human resources department ignored earlier reports of harassment. The allegations spurred an independent committee to investigate. Kelvin has consistently denied any allegations of sexual harassment or other misconduct at work. Employees said Kelvin made \u201csexual innuendos at staff,\u201d stroked people\u2019s necks, took off his shirt and openly talked about his sex life. When the petition \u2014 which quickly drew thousands of signatures \u2014 first circulated, the company said Kelvin often greeted shareholders, investors, customers and colleagues with hugs. The company also said it had \u201cclear and robust\u201d HR policies in place, including a 24-hour help line for confidential and anonymous tips. David Bernstein, Ted Baker\u2019s executive chairman, said that since Kelvin started the company, he has been the \u201cdriving force\u201d behind the global brand. Kelvin opened the first Ted Baker store in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1988. Last year, the Tatler estimated Kelvin\u2019s worth at more than $660 million. \u201cWe are determined to learn lessons from what has happened and from what our employees have told us and to ensure that, while the many positive and unique aspects of Ted\u2019s culture are maintained, appropriate changes are made,\u201d Bernstein said in a statement. Lindsay Page, who has served as the company\u2019s acting chief executive, will continue to lead the company. In a statement, Kelvin said he had decided to step away from the company \u201cso it can face 2019 with fresh energy and renewed spirit.\u201d He wrote that the past few months have been \u201cdeeply distressing\u201d and that he would be taking time privately with his family to consider what the future may include. Ted Baker responded with a two-pronged approach, said Timothy Coombs, a crisis communication expert at Texas A&M University. In addition to Kelvin stepping down, the company said it would specifically work to improve a company culture tainted by the allegations against him. That second step, Coombs said, is essential if Ted Baker wants to show investors that it is taking lessons away from Kelvin\u2019s downfall. Customers are less likely to shop elsewhere based on Kelvin\u2019s alleged misconduct, Coombs said. But investors may be wary of whether a new leadership team could make for a bumpy transition or affect the brand\u2019s worth. Midday Monday, Ted Baker\u2019s stock was up nearly 3 percent. \u201cThat\u2019s what investors are worried about: If there\u2019s a big shake-up, is this going to be a problem?\u201d Coombs said. \u201cIs this going to cause a loss of stock value?\u201d Over the past few years, several retail executives have been accused of sexual harassment or misconduct at work. Last year, model and actress Kate Upton accused Guess co-founder Paul Marciano of sexual harassment. An investigation looked into broader allegations, including inappropriate comments and texts, as well as unwanted kissing and groping. Marciano eventually resigned. In 2017, Mark Light, the chief executive of Signet Jewelers, said he was retiring for health reasons. At the time, Light was the subject of a class-action arbitration in which 69,000 women who worked at Sterling Jewelers, a company subsidiary, said they received unequal pay and promotions. And in 2014, Dov Charney was ousted from the top of American Apparel over sexual misconduct allegations and misuse of company money. A decade earlier, a writer for Jane said Charney engaged in oral sex and masturbated in front of her. Charney was also reported to have worn only underwear in front of employees. Chief executives who were also founders often have an \u201coutsize shadow\u201d on the companies they run, said Kirthi Kalyanam, director of the Retail Management Institute at Santa Clara University in California. Those founders can dominate company culture, Kalyanam said, which can make overhauling that culture all the more complicated. Any investigation into Kelvin\u2019s conduct should also look into whether other executives knew about these allegations and hid them, Kalyanam said. He pointed to reports that casino managers around magnate Steve Wynn concealed allegations about him for decades. \u201cIf it\u2019s not just [Kelvin], was there a broader culture?\u201d Kalyanam said of Ted Baker. \u201cAll of that needs to get cleaned out to help the company stay on course.\u201d","16":"CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand \u2014 Only a week after attacks on two mosques in New Zealand killed 50 worshippers, the country has banned sales of \u201cmilitary-style\u201d semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines. In the world of politics, it\u2019s a lightning fast response, especially when compared to the deeply contentious, long-running gun control debate in the United States. The suddenness of Thursday\u2019s ban, which came as the dead were being buried, has raised many questions, especially for those not familiar with firearms. Here\u2019s a closer look: ___ WHAT\u2019S BEING BANNED? Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that \u201cevery semi-automatic weapon used in the terrorist attack last Friday will be banned.\u201d Ardern said a sales ban was effective immediately to prevent stockpiling and would be followed by a complete ban on the weapons after new laws are rushed through. The ban includes any \u201cmilitary-style\u201d semi-automatic guns or shotguns that are capable of being used with a detachable magazine that holds more than five rounds. It also extends to accessories, such as bump stocks, used to convert guns into what the government called \u201cmilitary-style\u201d weapons. Military-style semi-automatics have been defined under New Zealand law as rifles with magazines exceeding seven shots, or with pistol grips, folding or telescopic butts, bayonet attachments or flash suppressors at the end of the barrel. Many different types of firearms, from pistols to rifles and shotguns, can be semi-automatic. Semi-automatic refers to a firearm\u2019s ability to self-load, not only firing a bullet with each trigger pull, but also reloading and making the firearm capable of firing again. ___ WHAT\u2019S NOT BEING BANNED? The ban does not include semi-automatic .22 caliber or smaller guns that hold up to 10 rounds or semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns with non-detachable magazines that hold up to five rounds. The guns not banned are commonly used by farmers and hunters. Caliber is the measurement of the diameter of the inside of a gun barrel. A higher caliber firearm uses larger rounds that can do more tissue damage and are more lethal. The government said the police and military would be exempt, as would businesses carrying out professional pest control. Access for international shooting competitions would also be considered. ___ WHAT HAPPENS TO BANNED GUNS? Ardern said people could hand over their guns under an amnesty while officials develop a formal buyback scheme, which could cost up to 200 million New Zealand dollars ($140 million). New Zealand police said on their website that the \u201ctransitional period\u201d would allow people to arrange to hand over their unlawful firearms to police without penalties. It encouraged people to fill out an online form and said after that police would be in touch to make arrangements. There could be legal exemptions to the ban, such as for pest controllers, but Ardern said any exemptions would be \u201ctightly regulated.\u201d \u201cFor other dealers, sales should essentially now cease. My expectation is that these weapons will now be returned to your suppliers and never enter into the New Zealand market again,\u201d she said. ___ HOW MANY GUNS ARE AFFECTED? There are nearly 250,000 licensed gun owners in New Zealand, which has a population of 5 million people. Officials estimate there are 1.5 million guns in the country. Sydney University gun policy expert Philip Alpers estimated that only 6 percent of all weapons in New Zealand were registered. He said there could be 500,000 semi-automatic rifles and shotguns. But, he added, \u201conly a small proportion of those would be capable of taking a large-capacity magazine. So that\u2019s the number that everyone is trying to guess.\u201d ___ DO NEW ZEALANDERS SUPPORT IT? The ban is widely supported and puts New Zealand \u201calmost exactly in line\u201d with Australia, the United Kingdom and \u201csomewhat with Canada,\u201d according to Professor Kevin Clements, chairman of Peace and Conflicts studies at the University of Otago and a firearms expert. One of New Zealand\u2019s largest gun retailers, Hunting & Fishing New Zealand, said it supports \u201cany government measure to permanently ban such weapons.\u201d The company said it would no longer stock any assault-style firearms of any category and would also stop selling firearms online. \u201cWhat (Ardern\u2019s) done is a very brave move, and it\u2019s the kind of move that can only be done in a common-law country where guns are not a right. Guns are a real privilege. If there was a legal right like there is in the United States, this would be much more difficult,\u201d said International law Professor Alexander Gillespie of Waikato University. But, he added, \u201cit\u2019s going to be expensive, and there\u2019s going to be a lot of pushback.\u201d ___ WHAT\u2019S NEXT? Alpers noted that New Zealand, although it requires handgun registration, \u201cis still the only country apart from the United States and to some degree Canada that doesn\u2019t have (firearm) registration as its third pillar of gun control\u201d along with licensing and treating possession as a conditional privilege. Alpers said rifles and shotguns aren\u2019t registered in the country. He called that \u201ca very important loophole\u201d but said Ardern \u201chas flagged her determination to pursue registration. Whether she\u2019ll be able to do it completely or not ... is another question.\u201d ___ Klug reported from Seoul, South Korea. Associated Press writers Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, and Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul contributed to this report.","17":"THE KEY An\u00a0investigator with the Georgia secretary of state's office, left, looks at a voting machine being tested in Conyers, Ga., on\u00a0Oct. 19, 2017. (David Goldman\/AP)\u00a0 As the House Homeland Security Committee meets for the first election security hearing of 2019 today, Congress is\u00a0still far away from a grand bargain to help protect state election systems from foreign hackers. But the goalposts may be changing with Democrats in charge of the House.\u00a0 The new top Republican on the committee,\u00a0Rep. Mike Rogers (Ala.), tells me he's ready to impose requirements on states to secure their\u00a0election systems against hackers. He called for a baseline of security states must meet before receiving money from the government to upgrade\u00a0outdated and vulnerable voting machines and secure other election infrastructure.\u00a0 \u201cWe want to get some minimum standards that have to be adhered to,\" Rogers tells me. And he says he's willing to work with Democrats to get it done. This is a\u00a0step forward from last Congress when many Republicans -- including governors-- balked at the idea of imposing\u00a0serious mandates on states after an initial delivery of $380 million for security with no strings attached. House Republicans last session largely evaded the question of election security; they did not offer any major proposals or\u00a0hold any\u00a0hearings on the topic until well into 2018. But the terrain looks different in Washington now that Democrats are exercising their new power in the House to push for a broad overhaul in U.S. elections -- and security mandates are starting to look more like the middle ground.  House Democrats' first\u00a0bill of the new Congress\u00a0mandates\u00a0states use paper ballots rather than digital ones and make other security upgrades in exchange for $120 million. But it also pushes for a whole host of progressive priorities opposed by many Republicans.\u00a0H.R. 1, also known as the For the People Act, would expand automatic voter registration, restore felons voting rights and\u00a0make Election Day a national holiday, among other things.\u00a0 Rogers says the Democrats' proposal is a nonstarter, but is open to compromise on the security parts.\u00a0 \u201cH.R. 1 is not a bipartisan vehicle,\" he said. \"But, it\u2019s my hope that after H.R. 1 moves on the House floor, we can revisit just the election security part with an actual vehicle that might move through the Senate.\u201d Rogers wants to organize a meeting in the next two months with House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) and leaders of the Senate Homeland Security Committee to hammer out a bill that can win bipartisan support in both chambers, he said. \u201cI want to make sure we\u2019re all singing off the same sheet of music, a vehicle that can get through the House and Senate,\u201d Rogers told me. \u201cAs long as we don\u2019t get too in the weeds and start getting to the point of picking winners and losers [in the election industry], I think we\u2019ll get Republicans to go along.\u201d Rogers\u2019s fig leaf\u00a0may not be enough, however,\u00a0to spark a compromise between emboldened House Democrats and Republicans who still control the Senate and have been notoriously wary of any kind of mandate on states.\u00a0That means Congress may be unable to pass meaningful legislation to secure election systems before the 2020 presidential contest when Homeland Security officials say foreign hackers may pose a much greater danger than during the 2018 midterms. It doesn't appear to be swaying Democrats, either: A Thompson staffer told me the chairman appreciates Rogers\u2019s commitment to election security but is focused on passing the Democratic bill. Thompson introduced a version of that bill\u2019s election security provisions last Congress, which won 126 Democratic co-sponsors and no Republican ones.\u00a0 There are also problems in the Senate where the most popular bipartisan bill last Congress, the Secure Elections Act,\u00a0basically punted on security mandates, leaving the question to an advisory panel convened by the Department of Homeland Security. That bill still never reached the Senate floor, partly because of White House concerns. Rogers hopes lawmakers can agree to a bill with specific mandates this Congress that goes further than the Secure Elections Act, he told me. That bill \u201cdidn\u2019t really crank my tractor,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it went far enough. We\u2019ve got to be more specific.\u201d Finally, there's also a partisan division among states seeking election security money, state officials have told me, with Democrats more comfortable with federal mandates than their Republican counterparts.\u00a0 California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, the state's top election official, will testify at today's hearing that Congress should endorse election security best practices, such as keeping election infrastructure off the Internet as much as possible, using paper ballots and rigorously testing voting systems before an election and auditing them afterward, according to written testimony his office provided me.\u00a0 States will need new federal grant money to implement those security measures, though, and to upgrade their current, outdated election systems, Padilla plans to testify. And the $380 million Congress granted last year simply wasn\u2019t enough, he\u2019ll say. \u201cThere are some elections officials searching on eBay for replacement parts for systems that are no longer supported by manufacturers,\u201d according to Padilla's prepared testimony. \u201cOthers are utilizing operating systems that are so old, their vendor no longer provides tech support \u2014 meaning some voting machines cannot be patched or updated with the latest security software. Simply put, too many elections officials are ill equipped to defend against 21st century threats.\u201d President Trump at the White House in Washington on Feb. 12. (Jabin Botsford\/The Washington Post) PINGED: President Trump is expected to sign an executive order by Friday that would aim to\u00a0protect U.S. telecommunications networks and could lead to barring Chinese companies including Huawei, The Washington Post's\u00a0Ellen Nakashima and Tony Romm reported. With the executive order, the\u00a0president is expected to declare a national emergency about the threat to the telecommunications supply chain. As a result, the Commerce Department will consult with the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to come up with rules to implement the policy;\u00a0officials\u00a0will have several months to develop\u00a0the rules. U.S. officials have said that Huawei could be used as a platform for Chinese spying. The order will not ban specific firms or countries, according to officials. \u201cMajor telecom companies such as AT&T and Verizon already bar Huawei equipment from their core networks, a response to concerns raised years ago by U.S. intelligence agencies,\u201d my colleagues reported.\u00a0\u201cBut officials say that issuing the executive order now is a way to show the world that the United States is leading by example, taking decisive measures to protect the telecom supply chain.\u201d Federal officials want the executive order to be ready before the\u00a0Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, a mobile industry conference, which will be held later this month.

The two men belong to the hacking collective\u00a0Apophis Squad, according to the Justice Department.\u00a0\u201cMembers of Apophis Squad used \u2018spoofed\u2019 email addresses to make it appear some threats had been sent by innocent parties, including the mayor of London, according to court papers,\u201d the AP reported. \u2014 More cybersecurity news from the public sector: A map of China is seen through a magnifying glass on a computer screen showing binary digits in this illustration photo in Singapore on Jan. 2, 2014. (Edgar Su\/Reuters) \u2014 Researchers are disagreeing over which hacking group carried out cyberattacks\u00a0against the Norwegian software company Visma, an international apparel company and an American law firm, CyberScoop's Sean Lyngaas reported. The cybersecurity companies Recorded Future and Rapid7 attributed the attacks to the Chinese government-linked hacking group APT10\u00a0in a report last week. The companies said they had\u00a0\u201chigh confidence\u201d that APT10 was behind the operations. \u201cBut analysts at other companies that follow APT10 say the activity described in the report is the work of another China-linked hacking group, called APT31 or Zirconium,\u201d CyberScoop reported. \u201cAn APT10 attack would have looked different, according to Kris McConkey, head of cyberthreat detection and response at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).\u201d Hands type on a computer keyboard in Los Angeles in this photo illustration on Feb. 27, 2013.

A frenzy of bidding and trading and changes of mind \u2014 all involving millions of dollars. Several trends already have appeared during the two days of the \u201clegal tampering\u201d period, and once moves became official: DISENCHANTMENT WORKS Antonio Brown didn\u2019t want to be a Steeler anymore. Nor did Le\u2019Veon Bell. Odell Beckham Jr., was unhappy with his quarterback in New Jersey. So Brown, whose antics at the end of the 2018 season pretty much guaranteed he would be leaving Pittsburgh, landed in Oakland, where he presumably is thrilled with a new contract that guarantees him $30 million; he had no guaranteed money remaining on his Steelers deal. How long he will be happy with Derek Carr after becoming dissatisfied with Ben Roethlisberger depends on how often and accurately Carr gets Brown the ball. Bell, who sat out the entire 2018 schedule rather than sign another franchise tag, saved a year of wear and tear, always a consideration for a running back. Then he got a megadeal from the Jets that satisfies his demands for financial security: $52.5 million for four years, with more than half of that pretty much guaranteed. He also has some attainable incentives that could increase the total package. The Beckham trade echoes the Brown situation only in that his shenanigans \u2014 and criticisms of Eli Manning \u2014 made his team tire of him despite all of his electrifying skills. Where the Giants prospered and the Steelers didn\u2019t was in the value of compensation: Cleveland parted with a first- and third-round draft pick and Jabrill Pepper, who should start at safety. But Beckham also got out of a place that didn\u2019t totally please him. BUILD THE TRENCHES While defensive linemen tend to come into the NFL and make an early impact, it\u2019s far more rare for blockers to do so. Thus, teams are turning more and more to free agency for guys to protect their most valuable commodity, the quarterback, and open holes for runners. The Raiders led the way here, grabbing left tackle Trent Brown, who was a major contributor to New England\u2019s title run, for $66 million over four years. Buffalo, whose 2018 season in part was destroyed by problems up front, got Chiefs center Mitch Morse for four years and $44.5 million, and tackle Ty Nsekhe ($14.5 million for two years). Recognizing how its O-line had regressed, Atlanta spent nearly $40 million for two guards, James Carpenter and Jamon Brown. Carolina, San Francisco and Seattle also dived in with huge sums for huge men on the O-line. And Baltimore re-signed what coach John Harbaugh calls \u201cthe best blocking tight end in the league,\u201d Nick Boyle, for $18 million over three years. GUARANTEED BUCKS Early returns indicate players are getting more guaranteed money, in total and percentage-wise. A fully guaranteed contract such as the deals hundreds of baseball players negotiate, remains extremely rare in the NFL. But there\u2019s progress being made, and perhaps Kirk Cousins\u2019 megadeal in 2018 (three years, $84 million) eventually will be a bellwether. TRENDING UP No question the Browns, Raiders, Jets, Bills and 49ers all took major steps in upgrading their rosters through trades and free agency. What do those five have in common, though? How about lots of losing in recent years? Certain units that needed improving, aside from the aforementioned offensive lines, got an influx of talent: Kansas City\u2019s and Green Bay\u2019s defense; Washington\u2019s secondary; and Jacksonville\u2019s quarterbacking with Nick Foles. TRENDING DOWN The Steelers, long the measuring rod in the AFC North, look severely weakened \u2014 and they already did so too often in tight games last season. Giants fans might be wondering why they should show up at MetLife Stadium this year. Well, there\u2019s the sensational Saquon Barkley. Miami, which traded starting QB Ryan Tannehill to Tennessee on Friday, is in full rebuild mode. Carolina could wind up there, too. ___","19":"In January, Shaw welcomed what appeared to be another clothing boutique. Except it wasn\u2019t a store at all, but a cheeky art experiment, unbeknownst to those who ventured in. The first thing visitors see when they enter Vaulte X-XII is its signature item \u2014 a plain white T-shirt vacuum-sealed in a Mylar bag and displayed in a glass case. The $50 price tag seems absurd, but not surprising given Vaulte\u2019s high-end motif. It\u2019s also the only item for sale. This is the moment, according to artist Christian Dutilh, when most visitors realize that Vaulte X-XII isn\u2019t the \u201canti-streetwear\u201d clothing store it claims to be. \u201cThere\u2019s an initial sense of confusion,\u201d Dutilh says, \u201cbut when they start to understand that [Vaulte] is a brand with hype and no substance, there\u2019s this wide smile that goes across their face.\u201d Dutilh and Jacob Weinzettel, co-founders of local design studio Composite Co., pitched their art project last fall to Washington Project for the Arts. The pair had dreamed of starting their own brand, but with a twist \u2014 so they proposed a store that would serve as a case study on consumerism. Washington Project for the Arts signed on to co-produce the project and helped the duo secure a venue, open through March 23. Dutilh and Weinzettel have extended the brand with a magazine and a series of Vaulte events. And yes, people have actually purchased the shirt (they keep extras in stock and sales proceeds benefit Washington Project for the Arts). Dutilh notes that once people discover Vaulte\u2019s true identity, the shirt feels less like a rip-off and more like a prized art piece. \u201cIt\u2019s a laugh, a little bit of self-reflection or interpersonal interaction; everybody has their own associations with the project,\u201d he says.

The country added only 20,000 jobs last month, well below what had been added in earlier months. Thanks in part to the devastation the recession wrought on employment a decade ago, we\u2019ve taken to looking at jobs numbers as a barometer of the economy, meaning that a 20,000-job gain can look worrisome. There is a point, though, at which the country will theoretically approach full employment \u2014 everyone who wants a job can get one. Our economy is based on supply and demand, as you likely learned in middle school, but that works for jobs, too. Because so many people are employed, the supply of workers is low, and employers are having trouble filling jobs. So employers will theoretically increase demand for the jobs they want to fill: by raising wages. If we look at how hourly earnings have tracked over time, it looks like a fairly steady increase. (The government breaks out hourly earnings into two groups: overall earnings and earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers. We\u2019ve highlighted the latter group above, since it\u2019s a better measure of how wages are changing for working-class Americans.) The above graph, showing a slow increase, is deceptive as a way to consider how the numbers have changed. So let\u2019s instead look more directly at the change that\u2019s occurred. If we compare hourly earnings in each month to earnings the month before, we see a dramatic change over the past year. Over the course of 2017, hourly earnings for nonsupervisory workers increased an average of 2.3 percent monthly. Over the course of 2018, it was 2.9 percent. This year, the average has been 3.4 percent, as it was in February. That seems like good news, but we need to overlay another metric: inflation. The government has another metric that it uses called real hourly earnings. It\u2019s the same earnings data as above, but adjusted to inflation (specifically, the consumer price index). This was the metric that has been problematic for some time, because earnings were barely keeping up with inflation \u2014 meaning that real earnings were fairly flat. From January 2008 to January 2018, hourly earnings increased by 26 percent, but earnings adjusted for inflation only increased by about 7 percent. We don\u2019t have data on the CPI figure for February, but if we assume that it increases on pace with the past year, we get an estimated real hourly earnings figure of $10.91. But, again, let\u2019s instead consider the year-over-year change, comparing that February estimate to the real hourly earnings in February 2018, etc. It looks like this. That spike at the end? That\u2019s good news, showing that earnings are increasing much faster relative to inflation than they had been. Why is this happening? President Trump would likely point to the December 2017 tax cuts, which was meant to boost wages by giving companies more money to invest in workers. (And to buy back stock, which is where a lot of it went.) The spike above began in July, several months after those cuts went into effect. For the year before that, the consumer price index grew, on average, by about 0.58 points a month. Since July, it has grown an average of 0.22 points a month. Slower inflation coupled with wage growth means a faster-growing real earnings figure. But who\u2019s complaining? The spending power of workers\u2019 wages is growing quickly. We may not be at full employment, but people are working, and they can buy more with what they earn. It\u2019s hard to argue with that.","21":"The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the United States last year posted an $891.2\u00a0billion trade deficit in merchandise, the largest in the nation\u2019s 243-year history despite more than two years of President Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies. The results were a sobering reminder that the laws of economics still apply to a president who had promised to supercharge economic growth while simultaneously shrinking the chronic U.S. trade deficit. Those twin promises proved incompatible, as economists had predicted.  By cutting taxes and taking the lid off government spending, Trump gave the economy a shot of adrenaline. By thinning government regulations, he sought to further spur growth and hiring.  But as these efforts boosted take-home pay, Americans spent more on foreign-made iPhones, Toyotas and Heinekens. And as the U.S. economy surged ahead of Europe\u2019s and Japan\u2019s, four Federal Reserve interest rate hikes lifted the dollar, making American exports more expensive. \u201cMacroeconomics end up ruling. You can\u2019t wish it away. You can\u2019t tariff it away,\u201d said William Reinsch, a former Commerce Department official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Tariffs became a key part of Trump\u2019s strategy for shrinking the trade deficit, the difference between the country\u2019s high import bill and its lower export sales. He used the import taxes \u2014 on solar panels, washing machines, steel, aluminum and assorted Chinese goods \u2014 to force China and other countries into negotiations, with the aim of rebalancing trade flows. But while negotiations remain underway \u2014 with hopes of a deal with China this month \u2014 the data released Wednesday showed that significant improvement in the nation\u2019s trade balance remains an ambition rather than an achievement. Even with China, which has been hit hardest by U.S. tariffs, the trade gap reached a record $419\u00a0billion last year. Administration officials say they are working to overcome decades of poor trade policy. Trump this month labeled the trade deficit a \u201cdisaster,\u201d blaming \u201chorrible deals\u201d negotiated by his predecessors and rampant cheating by U.S. trading partners. The president told a cheering crowd that he was \u201cstanding up for the American worker,\u201d something a president was doing \u201cfor the first time in many, many decades.\u201d His chief trade negotiator, Robert E. Lighthizer, said last week that the administration has taken steps toward \u201ca more balanced and sustainable trading system\u201d by renegotiating agreements with South Korea, Canada and Mexico, seeking a new deal with China and by increasing enforcement of U.S. trade laws. But if the president\u2019s goal is to close the trade deficit, the Commerce Department\u2019s final 2018 report, which was delayed by the partial government shutdown, showed how ambitious a goal that is. Last year\u2019s goods shortfall topped the 2006 record of $838.3\u00a0billion, which was set as the housing bubble was peaking, and marked the third consecutive year of rising deficits. A broader measure, which includes the services sector, showed a $621\u00a0billion deficit \u2014 more than $100\u00a0billion greater than the figure Trump inherited from President Barack Obama. It has been evident for months that Trump was not shrinking a trade gap that he calls \u201cunsustainable\u201d and says represents a major transfer of wealth from Americans to foreigners. The president now begins his reelection drive with a core campaign promise unfulfilled \u2014 and with a recent flurry of economic research showing that his embrace of tariffs is damaging the U.S. economy. \u201cDuring the campaign, Donald Trump claimed that large trade deficits represented failed leadership and flawed trade policies,\u201d said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.). \u201cIt is time for President Trump to acknowledge that his scattershot approach to trade policy is failing and explain how he intends to change course and reverse these record deficits.\u201d The president often cites the trade deficit as an indicator of U.S. decline and a sign that other nations discriminate against American companies. Many economists see it as far less consequential, except as it reflects Americans\u2019 collective overspending. Just as he vowed to eliminate the trade deficit, Trump had also promised to trim the U.S. federal budget deficit, a perennial Republican goal. During the 2016 campaign, he had pledged to balance the budget \u201crelatively quickly.\u201d But instead, the tax cut and boom in government spending has spawned more red ink, with the budget gap expected to hit $900\u00a0billion this year and the national debt nearing $18\u00a0trillion. All that borrowing enables Americans to ramp up their spending, including on imported goods, widening the trade deficit. The second ingredient in the swollen trade deficit is the high dollar, which acts as a price increase for American exporters, making it harder to compete with foreign rivals. Today, the dollar is 19\u00a0percent above its 10-year average against the currencies of major U.S. trading partners, according to Federal Reserve data. The Commerce report comes amid indications that negotiations with China may be in their final weeks. Trump has been more eager for a deal as markets gyrated in recent months and forecasters said his tariff wars were threatening U.S. economic growth. China has offered to buy a reported $1.2\u00a0trillion in additional American products over the next six years in a deal that reportedly would ease each side\u2019s tariffs, usher in changes to Beijing\u2019s state-led economic model and include tough new enforcement mechanisms. \u201cOne thing is for certain,\u201d wrote Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist for MUFG Union Bank, wrote in a note to clients. \u201cThere will be a U.S. and China agreement on trade as the administration cannot allow the uncertainty to take a toll on economic growth any longer. Not when the presidential election is less than two years away.\u201d But any such deal may not change the dynamics widening the trade deficit, many economists say. Increased Chinese purchases of U.S. goods would probably mean fewer sales to other countries, shrinking the trade gap with China but leaving the global balance largely unchanged. With the economy at or close to full employment, U.S. farms and factories have a limited ability to sharply increase output to meet a sudden increase in Chinese orders. \u201cThat reality is not going to change,\u201d said economist Matthew J. Slaughter, dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. In a 2016 campaign speech, Trump called the trade deficit a \u201cpolitician-made disaster\u201d and promised swift change. \u201cWe can turn it all around \u2014 and we can turn it around fast,\u201d he said. Trump has used tariffs more aggressively than any other American president since the 1930s. In a speech Saturday, he called them \u201cthe greatest negotiating tool in the history of our country\u201d and credited them with bringing trade partners such as China to the bargaining table. \u201cBillions of dollars, right now, are pouring into our Treasury,\u201d he told the Conservative Political Action Conference, adding that Chinese exporters are absorbing almost the entire burden of the tariffs. But a pair of new studies concludes that he is wrong. \u201cWhen we impose a tariff, it is the domestic consumers and purchasers of imports that bear the full cost of the tariffs,\u201d said David Weinstein, an economics professor at Columbia University, who co-wrote one of the papers. Weinstein said the president appears to be relying on a 2018 analysis of data from the 1990s, when the United States represented a larger share of the global economy and enjoyed more leverage over exporters in other countries. Weinstein\u2019s study, co-written with Mary Amiti of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Princeton University\u2019s Stephen J. Redding, reviewed what actually occurred last year after U.S. tariffs took effect. It concluded that Americans paid the entire tariff bill. A second study \u2014 by four economists from the University of California at Los Angeles, Yale University, the University of California at Berkeley and Columbia University \u2014 reached the same conclusion. The best chance of the trade deficit shrinking anytime soon would require an economic downturn that no one wants. In 2009, amid the Great Recession, the trade deficit fell 40\u00a0percent from the peak three years earlier, to about $506\u00a0billion. \u201cIf you want to lower the trade deficit, have a recession,\u201d Reinsch said.","22":"With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0Barack Obama pleaded with a crowd of teenagers on Tuesday night to defy stereotypes about what it means to be a man of color.  \u201cWe live in a culture where our worth is measured by how much money we have and how famous we are,\u201d the former president lamented in Oakland, Calif.\u00a0\u201cI will tell you, at the end of the day, the thing that will give you confidence is not that. I know a lot of rich people that are all messed up!\u201d Joined onstage by Golden State Warriors basketball star Steph Curry, Obama decried bullying and selfishness while imploring young people who are involved in his My Brother\u2019s Keeper initiative to pursue causes greater than themselves. He explained the concept of self-worth and touted the virtues of being sensitive to other people\u2019s feelings. He criticized materialism and encouraged monogamy. \u201cIf you are really confident about your financial situation, you probably are not going to be wearing an eight-pound chain around your neck because you know, \u2018I got bank. I don\u2019t have to show you how much I\u2019ve got because I feel good,\u2019\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf you are very confident about your sexuality, you don't have to have eight women around you twerking \u2026 because [you know], \u2018I\u2019ve got one woman, who I am very happy with. And she\u2019s a strong woman.\u2019\u201d Obama blamed pop culture for amplifying toxic messages about modern masculinity. \u201cLet\u2019s face it: A\u00a0lot of hip-hop and rap music is built around me showing how I got more money than you, I can disrespect you and you can\u2019t do nothing about it, I\u2019m going to talk about you and punk you,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIronically, that actually shows the vulnerability that you feel! \u201cWe tend to rise to the expectations that are set for us,\u201d added Obama. \u201cIf a young boy is taught early on, \u2018You are going to be kind to people, not bully people,\u2019 that will have an impact. If you say, \u2018You treat young women with respect. They are not objects. They are humans with the same aspirations and desires, and they are just as worthy of respect as you are,\u2019 that has an impact. We\u2019ve got to set that tone early in life.\u201d The town-hall-style Q&A offered a timely reminder of the moral authority that\u2019s traditionally been vested in our presidents, both current and former. Obama repeatedly touted the importance of respecting, and listening to, women and then discussed race in a candid way. \u201cOften times, historically, racism in this society sends a message that you are less than and weak, so we feel like we\u2019ve got to compensate by exaggerating certain stereotypical ways that men are supposed to act,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a trap that we fall into, that we have to pull out of. If you\u2019re confident about your strength, you don\u2019t need to show me by putting someone else down. Show me how strong you are in that you can lift someone else up and treat someone well and be respectful.\u201d -- The event was held to mark the fifth anniversary of My Brother's Keeper, an initiative Obama started after the shooting death in 2012 of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed\u00a017-year-old. \u201cSome of you remember, although some of you were so young you may not,\u201d the former president said. \u201cAs somebody who is the head of federal law enforcement, I could not comment on the particulars of the case, but what I could say was that Trayvon could have been my son. \u2026 It required us as a society to wake up.\u201d (Left unsaid was that President Trump does not feel so reticent about weighing in on active federal law enforcement investigations.) The singer John Legend, who performed a cover of Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On\u201d for the crowd, led a panel discussion with the mothers of Martin, Oscar Grant and Jordan Davis. \u201cIt\u2019s not about Trayvon anymore; it\u2019s about the young people in here,\u201d said Sybrina Fulton, Martin\u2019s mother. \u201cAlthough Trayvon is not here for me to watch grow, to watch him excel, I want all those things for you. \u2026 I want you to be educated. I want you to be strong. I want you to be leaders, not followers.\u201d -- Obama has grown plainly more comfortable discussing issues related to race since leaving office liberated him. \u201cWhat we want to do is create a space in which young men of color, and young men generally, do not feel as if, \u2018For me to be respected in my community, I\u2019ve got to act a certain way,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the violence and pain that we suffer in our communities arises out of young men who nobody has said to them what it means to be respected. So they are looking around and thinking, \u2018Well, I guess being respected means [that] I can make you back down.\u2019 Or, \u2018I can disrespect you, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u2019 That is a self-defeating model for being a man! So we have to constantly lift up examples of the successful men who don\u2019t take that approach. That\u2019s hard to do in this society.\u201d -- Discussing criminal justice policy, Obama made clear that law enforcement can be a force for good. \u201cIn fact, some communities need more police, not fewer police,\u201d he said. The former president said it\u2019s important that cops get training and build relationships on their beats so that they understand just because someone is \u201cwearing a hoodie does not mean they\u2019re a criminal.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just the style,\u201d Obama said. Barack Obama hugs Golden State Warriors basketball star Stephen Curry on Tuesday night after speaking at the My Brother's Keeper Alliance summit in Oakland, Calif.\u00a0(Jeff Chiu\/AP) -- The graying 57-year-old, who for eight years was the most powerful man on the planet, tried earnestly to relate and connect with an audience of black, Latino and Native American teenage males who are fighting to escape cycles of poverty, dependency and violence. The goal of the public-private initiative, which is now part of the Obama Foundation and has spread to nearly 250 cities, is to help minority boys who face a variety of systemic disadvantages. Obama noted that government alone cannot fix problems, and that local governments often play a more important role than the federal government. He said he\u2019s now focused more on the civil society elements of the work because he doesn\u2019t hold elected office.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to be working on these issues, along with a host of other issues, for the remainder of my life,\u201d Obama said. A teenager from a Native American school in Albuquerque asked what struggles he went through as a kid. \u201cI didn\u2019t know my father very well. I met him once, and that was it,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI was all kinds of screwed up when I was in high school. I was a good kid in the sense that I think I was always kind to people. I didn\u2019t have a mean spirit. But I did not have a sense of purpose or a clear sense of direction through a big chunk of my high school years. In retrospect, I recognize some of it was I was angry about my father not being there. Some of it was I was growing up in an environment as an African American boy where we didn\u2019t have a large African American community. So there were all sorts of reasons for why I was acting out the way I did. \u2026 \u201cWhat ended up being the most important thing is when I stopped thinking about myself, and I started thinking about how I could be useful to other people,\u201d he continued. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up and become the person I am until I was less focused on me and I was more focused on how I could be useful and who I could help. \u2026 When you\u2019re helping somebody \u2026 and you see the impact, that gives you confidence.\u201d Obama said a lot of dads want to be around for their families, but they are not because of mass incarceration, discrimination and the lack of job opportunities. \u201cWe can all be surrogate fathers,\u201d said the dad to two daughters. \u201cMy father might not have been in my house, but there were a whole bunch of men who taught me something and guided me.\u201d -- In honor of Black History Month, Obama shared a nonfiction reading list ahead of the event to help people \u201cbetter understand our country\u2019s past and our evolving, persistent struggles with race.\u201d The former president\u2019s list has some great titles that complement the syllabus I prepared for Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) last week: Obama also shared a link to a New York Times story from March 2018 about data showing the \u201cpunishing reach of racism for black boys.\u201d\u00a0 -- The former president mostly steered clear of politics, though he noted at one point that the Trump administration has reversed the guidance his administration issued to local school districts to lower suspension rates among communities of color. The crowd booed. \u201cNobody hears your boos,\u201d Obama answered. \u201cThey\u2019ll hear your vote.\u201d  He said it\u2019s ultimately up to young people to get involved and change the system. \u201cThe truth of the matter is that nothing changes if citizens living in communities aren\u2019t paying attention and aren\u2019t educating themselves about how decisions are made about a school board, how decisions are made about police oversight, how decisions are made about drug laws,\u201d said Obama. \u201cYou can have a bunch of politicians or celebrities talk all they want, but ultimately what will actually bring about change is when all of you go back to your respective communities and activate and educate yourselves and then insist whoever it is that\u2019s in charge of making those decisions is making them \u2026 for the right reasons and in the right way. And if there are people who aren\u2019t doing that, they should be replaced. And if there\u2019s nobody to replace them, then you should step up and prepare yourself to replace them.\u201d WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Federal offices in Washington, along with schools and universities in the area, will be closed today because of\u00a0a winter storm.\u00a0Two to four inches of snow will probably accumulate in the immediate metro area this morning before turning into sleet and freezing rain. The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: \u201cHazardous road conditions are likely through the morning hours, with gradual improvement from south to north later this afternoon into the evening. But that\u2019s only after a period of sleet and freezing rain covers parts of the area, mainly north and west of D.C., with a glaze of ice in time for what\u2019s left of an afternoon commute. The worst icing and potential for scattered power outages is north and west of the Beltway.\u201d Metrorail is expected to operate trains every 12 minutes on all lines. Metrobus service will begin on a limited basis.\u00a0(Find the full list of closures here.) -- The White House is planning to assemble the Presidential Committee on Climate Security, a panel that will assess whether climate change poses a national security threat. Juliet Eilperin and Missy Ryan report: \u201cThe committee, which would be established by executive order, is being spearheaded by William Happer, a National Security Council senior director. Happer, an emeritus professor of physics at Princeton University, has said that carbon emissions linked to climate change should be viewed as an asset rather than a pollutant. The initiative represents the Trump administration\u2019s most recent attempt to question the findings of federal scientists and experts on climate change.\" GET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b Republicans in the West Virginia legislature tabled a bill\u00a0expanding vouchers for charter\u00a0and private schools hours after the state\u2019s teachers went on strike to protest the proposal.

Mark Mazzetti, Maggie Haberman, Nicholas Fandos and Michael S. Schmidt report.\u00a0Here are the most interesting details: -- The FBI developed a backup plan to protect evidence from its Russia investigation after Trump fired Jim Comey,\u00a0the AP\u2019s Eric Tucker reports: \u201cThe goal was to ensure that the information collected under the investigations \u2026 would survive the firings or reassignments of top law enforcement officials. Those officials included [Bob Mueller], who was appointed eight days after Trump fired Comey in May 2017. Andrew McCabe, who became acting director after Comey was fired, asked investigators to develop a plan to ensure evidence would be protected.\u201d -- The federal judge overseeing Roger Stone\u2019s criminal case has scheduled a hearing for tomorrow to consider whether his conditions of release should be modified or revoked after he posted (and later deleted) a photo of the judge with what looked like a gun\u2019s crosshairs near her head. Reis Thebault, Manuel Roig-Franzia and Rachel Weiner report: \u201cIn a text message to The Washington Post on Tuesday, Stone wrote: \u2018I will be present for the hearing as ordered.\u2019 He also offered another explanation for the image in the photo, writing that \u2018it is evidentially more correctly a Celtic symbol.\u2019 \u2026 In an appearance Monday on Infowars, the conspiracy-minded website, Stone described the image in the photo he posted as an \u2018occult symbol.\u2019\u201d Attorney General William Barr listens as Trump declares a national emergency during a speech in the Rose Garden on\u00a0Friday. (Jabin Botsford\/The Washington Post) -- Trump last night nominated Jeffrey Rosen, the deputy secretary of transportation, to replace Rod Rosenstein as deputy attorney general. Rosen used to work at Kirkland & Ellis with William Barr, the new AG. \u201cSome Justice Department employees say Barr, who has not publicly addressed the president\u2019s latest criticisms of the Russia investigation, has buoyed spirits in a department that has had a rocky two years,\u201d\u00a0Philip Rucker and Matt Zapotosky report. \u201cBarr, people who know him say, is laboring to maintain his reputation as a relatively independent and principled leader while simultaneously reacting to pressure from his boss, who demands loyalty from his appointees and nominees and frequently disparages the Justice Department as it investigates his campaign and conduct.\u201d Sidebar: \u201cComplicating Barr\u2019s position is the fact that his son-in-law, Tyler McGaughey, a Justice Department lawyer, recently began working in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office. McGaughey, who had been prosecuting major crimes in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Alexandria, was among several lawyers there who have been detailed to the White House.\u201d -- Trump is so angry at Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats that White House staffers and senior Hill Republicans worry the president might fire the former GOP senator. Shane Harris, Josh Dawsey and Ellen Nakashima report: \u201cTrump is still \u2018enraged\u2019 about Coats\u2019s congressional testimony on national security threats last month, believing that the director undercut the president\u2019s authority when he shared intelligence assessments about Iran, North Korea and the Islamic State that are at odds with many of Trump\u2019s public statements, said one adviser who spoke with the president over the weekend. \u2026 A White House official said the president\u2019s frustration with Coats was real but didn\u2019t believe he would be fired anytime soon.\u00a0...\u00a0Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee were upset by the prospect of Coats\u2019s firing. ... \u201cLast July, Coats was being interviewed onstage at the annual Aspen Security Forum when the White House announced via tweet that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been invited to Washington. Coats was clearly taken by surprise and made little effort to hide his displeasure. \u2026 Coats also said no one had asked him if it was a good idea for Trump to meet privately with Putin at a summit meeting in Helsinki. \u2026 Coats said that he hadn\u2019t been told what happened in the meeting. If asked, he said, he\u2019d have advised the president against speaking one-on-one with Putin and that U.S. security officials were concerned there were no notes taken. \u2026 Trump was livid, and believed that Coats was trying to embarrass him in a room filled with high-ranking current and former national security officials \u2026 Two days later, Coats publicly apologized for what he called an \u2018admittedly awkward response\u2019 to the news of the Putin invitation.\u201d -- Speaking of Putin, the Russian president said this morning that Russia's new missiles will target the United States if Washington ever deploys missiles in Europe. In a nationally televised speech, Putin said Russia has a\u00a0new nuclear-capable glider\u00a0and underwater drone that have been tested and that the weapons are ready to be added to the country's arsenal. (Developing.)\u00a0 -- Microsoft publicly identified a second Russian operation that targeted prominent think tanks before the midterms.\u00a0Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg\u00a0report: \u201cThe group targeted more than 100 European employees of the German Marshall Fund, the Aspen Institute Germany, and the German Council on Foreign Relations, influential groups that focus on transatlantic policy issues. The attacks, which took place during the last three months of 2018, come ahead of European parliamentary elections in May. They highlight a continuously aggressive campaign by Russian operatives to undermine democratic institutions in countries they see as adversaries.\u201d\u00a0 Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends the opening of the G-20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires. (Sergio Moraes\/Reuters) FOLLOW THE MONEY: -- \u201cKey members of the Trump administration pushed a plan to sell nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia in the months after the inauguration despite objections from members of the National Security Council and other senior White House officials, according to a new report from congressional Democrats,\u201d per Tom Hamburger, Steven Mufson and Ellen Nakashima. \u201cThe 24-page report from the House Oversight and Reform Committee is based on internal White House documents and the accounts of unnamed whistleblowers. It said the objectors \u2014 including White House lawyers and National Security Council officials \u2014 opposed the plan out of concern that it violated laws designed to prevent the transfer of nuclear technology that could be used to support a weapons program. \u201cThe possible sale of nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia was discussed in the Oval Office just last week. The meeting included Energy Secretary Rick Perry, representatives from the NSC and State Department, and a dozen nuclear industry chief executives, one of the people present told The Washington Post. \u201cThe report, key elements of which were confirmed by people directly familiar with the matter, cites whistleblowers who said that the Trump appointees \u2018ignored directives from top ethics advisers who repeatedly \u2014 but unsuccessfully \u2014 ordered senior White House officials to halt their efforts.\u2019 \u2026 \u201cThe report released Tuesday notes that one of the power plant manufacturers that could benefit from a nuclear deal, Westinghouse Electric, is a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management, the company that has provided financial relief to the family of Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and a senior White House adviser. Brookfield Asset Management took a 99-year lease on the Kushner family\u2019s deeply indebted New York City property at 666 Fifth Ave. Kushner is preparing for a trip to the Middle East to discuss the economic component of his Middle East peace initiative \u2026 A lawyer for Kushner did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\u201d -- Deutsche Bank executives were so worried the Trump Organization would default on about $340 million\u00a0of loans after the 2016 election that they considered extending payment rates past 2025, when the president\u2019s potential second term would be completed. From Bloomberg News\u2019s Gavin Finch, Steven Arons and Shahien Nasiripour: \u201cThe bank ultimately decided against restructuring the loans to the Trump Organization, which come due in 2023 and 2024, and chose instead not to do any new business with Trump while he is president \u2026\u00a0The outstanding Deutsche Bank debt includes $125 million for the Trump National Doral Miami resort, which matures in 2023, according to federal records and mortgage documents. The company also owes $170 million for the Trump International Hotel in Washington and has another loan against a Chicago tower, both of which come due in 2024. ...\u00a0In the four years before his election, Trump borrowed more than $620 million from Deutsche Bank and a separate lender, Ladder Capital, to finance projects in Manhattan, Chicago, Washington and a Miami suburb.\" Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross participates in trade talks on Jan. 30. (Jim Watson\/AFP\/Getty Images) ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN AND WOMEN: -- The Office of Government Ethics declined to certify Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\u2019s financial disclosure form, which it described as \u201cnot accurate.\u201d CNN\u2019s Gregory Wallace, Ellie Kaufman and Donna Borak report: \u201cEmory Rounds, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, wrote that Ross reported in his annual financial disclosure that he sold bank stock that other reports indicate he did not sell. That meant \u2018the filer was therefore not in compliance with his ethics agreement at the time of the report,\u2019 Rounds wrote. The watchdog group that drew attention to the report, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said OGE declining to certify a report \u2018does not normally happen.\u2019\u201d -- In response, Ross said he didn't mean to file incorrect financial disclosures. Reis Thebault reports: \u201cRoss said he mistakenly believed he had sold the assets in question \u2014 100 shares of BankUnited stock \u2014 in May 2017. When he realized his error, he said, he sold the stock and disclosed the sale in October 2018. The shares, Ross said, were worth $3,700, an amount that federal regulations deem 'below the threshold of a possible conflict of interest.'\u00a0(According to a Bloomberg News report, that threshold is $15,000 for publicly traded securities.) \"'Therefore, even if a BankUnited matter had come before the Department while I owned the shares \u2014 and I have not been made aware of any such matter \u2014 I would not have been disqualified from working on it,'\u00a0Ross said. He called the inaccuracy 'the only known error in my annual report.'\"\u00a0 -- Congressional Democrats accused a senior official at the Education Department of trying to oust the agency\u2019s inspector general over her attempts to investigate Secretary Betsy DeVos. NBC News\u2019s Heidi Przybyla reports: \u201cLawmakers from four House and Senate committees who oversee the department sent a letter to DeVos on Tuesday, suggesting that the effort to replace the department\u2019s acting inspector general, Sandra Bruce, had been related to her duties in overseeing the probe of DeVos\u2019 decision to reinstate ACICS, an accreditor that had been stripped of its certification by the Obama administration.\u201d -- Sarah Isgur, Jeff Sessions\u2019s former chief spokeswoman at Justice, will join CNN as a political editor overseeing coverage of the 2020 campaign. Politico\u2019s Eliana Johnson and Michael Calderone report: \u201cIsgur joined the administration in 2017 after overcoming resistance from the president, who balked at bringing on a political operative who had trashed him on the campaign trail. As deputy campaign manager for Carly Fiorina\u2019s presidential campaign, and in the months after Fiorina bowed out of the race, Isgur repeatedly laced into Trump. \u2026 While it is common for departing administration officials to join cable news networks as analysts or contributors, it is less common for them to oversee news coverage. Isgur has no experience in news but a long history as a political operative.\u201d\u00a0CNN staffers had a generally negative reaction to the opaque process for hiring Isgur, which one employee described to the Daily Beast as \u201cextremely demoralizing.\u201d -- Former White House legislative affairs director Marc Short will serve as the vice president\u2019s new chief of staff. Josh Dawsey reports: \u201cThe hire marks the first time an aide who left the Trump White House has returned to work in a West Wing known for its chaotic environment and staff turnover. \u2026 Short left the administration last year after working as Trump\u2019s first legislative affairs director but has kept in touch with the vice president, White House officials said. \u2026 While Trump grew frustrated with Short over a spending bill last year that he signed but did not like because it did not provide the amount he wanted for his border wall, he was largely on good terms with the president and is well-liked in the administration, current and former administration officials said.\u201d -- \u201cAfter his departure, Mr. Short was occasionally blamed by name by the president for the administration\u2019s failure to secure more money to pay for a border wall, White House officials said. But that relationship has been repaired in recent weeks due in large part to Mr. Short\u2019s defense of Mr. Trump on CNN, appearances the president has kept an eye on,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Michael Bender adds. THE IMMIGRATION WARS:  -- The Trump administration canceled $929 million in federal grants for California's high-speed rail project, which Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) sees as political payback for the state leading a lawsuit to block the president's national emergency declaration. From the Los Angeles Times's Ralph Vartabedian and Matthew Ormseth: \u201cThe Transportation Department also said it was 'actively exploring every legal option' to get back an additional $2.5-billion grant that is being used to finance the construction of 119 miles of rail line in the Central Valley. The two federal grants represent about one-fourth of all the funding for the project to date \u2014 money critical to completing the Central Valley portion and finishing environmental reviews for other segments between San Francisco and Los Angeles.\u201d -- \u201cTrump insisted to reporters Tuesday afternoon that he had an \u2018absolute right\u2019 to declare an emergency and said that it is an \u2018open and closed case\u2019 that he can use the declaration to circumvent Congress to fund long-sought barriers at the border,\u201d\u00a0John Wagner reports.\u00a0\u201cTrump sounded more confident of his standing. \u2018I think in the end, we\u2019re going to be very successful with the lawsuit,\u2019 he said, adding that it\u2019s possible he might even prevail within the 9th Circuit.\u201d\u00a0 -- Senate Republicans remain divided over Trump's declaring emergency powers to build a wall: Ten\u00a0are on the record supporting it, 17 have expressed concerns, and four have spoken in opposition to the order. The other 22 GOP senators have avoided taking any public stance on it. (Kate Rabinowitz is keeping a whip count for us.) -- Border Patrol agents are growing accustomed to their new role as relief providers, as\u00a0they are often the first to meet Central American families as they arrive. CBP has\u00a0strengthened medical teams at border facilities, and agents have been stocking up on powdered milk and even offering cookies to migrant kids. Maria Sacchetti reports: \u201cThe deaths of two Guatemalan children in December and the massive groups of Central American families crossing the border are increasingly transforming the Border Patrol\u2019s role from national security to humanitarian relief. ...\u00a0Well over half the people taken into custody in recent months have been parents and children, with hundreds surrendering at a time, often in isolated locations. \u2026\u00a0 \u201cAgents say they are frustrated that parents are using children to gain entry into the United States, and they fault smugglers for taking them on risky journeys.\u00a0Agents were horrified to find a 6-year-old boy abandoned in the Arizona desert last year, in 100-degree heat. He carried a lunchbox and said he was looking for his mother in the United States. Children as young as toddlers have been heaved over high border fences to the desert sand below.\u201d Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg appears at an event\u00a0in New York. (Rebecca Gibian\/AP) THE SUPREME COURT: -- For the second time in as many weeks, Chief Justice John Roberts\u00a0sided with his liberal colleagues on how to interpret Supreme Court precedent. Robert Barnes reports: \u201cRoberts was pointed in saying the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has \u2018misapplied\u2019 a 2017 ruling that instructed that court to reconsider its analysis of whether death-row inmate Bobby James Moore was intellectually disabled, and thus ineligible for execution. Less than two weeks ago, Roberts joined the liberals in stopping a Louisiana abortion law that was nearly identical to a Texas law the court had struck down in 2016. \u2026 Roberts\u2019s role in the abortion and death penalty cases were notable partly because he had been in dissent in the original decisions.\u201d -- Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg returned to the bench for the first time since her December cancer surgery. Barnes and Mark Berman report: \u201cGinsburg, 85, was the first justice to ask a question during the oral arguments in a case centering on whether the government could be considered a \u2018person\u2019 able to challenge a patent. \u2026 For much of the time, Ginsburg remained still as her colleagues alternately leaned back in their seats, swiveled in place or rubbed their faces. Her head slightly bowed, she peered out over the court and appeared focused on the arguments. \u2026 She entered and left the courtroom without any assistance. Her appearance seemed to be the main attraction for some of the journalists who gathered into the crowded courtroom; two quickly left once she had appeared and asked her first question.\u201d -- Justice Clarence Thomas criticized New York Times v. Sullivan, the court\u2019s landmark libel ruling, as a \u201cpolicy-driven\u201d decision \u201cmasquerading as constitutional law,\u201d\u00a0somewhat echoing Trump\u2019s complaints on the issue. Barnes reports: \u201cSome media law experts expressed concern over Thomas\u2019s concern. Jonathan Peters, a professor of media law at the University of Georgia, said New York Times v. Sullivan \u2018is essential to our modern understanding of press freedom.\u2019 \u2026 But Thomas and the late Justice Antonin Scalia have said the court may have intruded into a space in which it was not needed.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0'The States are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm,\u2019\u201d\u00a0Thomas wrote. -- The high court declined to intervene in the criminal trial of former congressman Aaron\u00a0Schock\u00a0(R-Ill.) on corruption charges. Politico\u2019s Josh Gerstein reports: \u201cIn an order issued Tuesday morning, the justices rejected Schock\u2019s request that the high court hear his arguments that the case charging him with fraud, making false statements and theft of government funds unconstitutionally intrudes into the internal affairs of the legislative branch.\u201d 2020 WATCH: -- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has hired Faiz Shakir, the ACLU\u2019s national political director, as his presidential campaign manager. The Daily Beast\u2019s Gideon Resnick, Spencer Ackerman and Sam Stein report: \u201cIn hiring Shakir, Sanders brings into the fold one of the Democratic Party\u2019s better-traveled operatives\u2014an official with limited campaign experience but with ties to the party\u2019s think tank infrastructure, its Hill operations, and the larger progressive universe. \u2026 Before joining the ACLU, he was a senior adviser to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and before that he worked with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). \u2026 Shakir, 39, is almost certainly the first campaign manager of a major presidential campaign who identifies as a Muslim.\u201d -- The ACLU intends to capitalize on its expanded influence during the Trump era by hosting events for Democratic presidential candidates. HuffPost\u2019s Kevin Robillard reports: \u201cThe ACLU\u2019s revenue has doubled and its members have quadrupled since [Trump\u2019s] election. \u2026 And it will soon get more involved in the presidential contest. The ACLU wants to host debates and forums featuring the candidates in order to probe their stances on issues critical to the group, including criminal justice reform, voting rights and freedom of speech. \u2026 [The group\u2019s executive director] said that while the group won\u2019t officially endorse any candidate, he does expect some of the many Democratic hopefuls, if not most, to fall short of its standards.\u201d -- The Sanders campaign said it raised $4 million from 330,000 donors on his first day as a candidate. -- The rest of the Vermont congressional delegation \u2014 Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy and Rep. Peter Welch \u2014 endorsed Sanders\u2019s bid. Welch also supported Sanders in 2016, but Leahy endorsed Hillary Clinton that year. (VPR) -- Democrats in the 2020 field are battling two challenges simultaneously: Trump and his anti-socialist rhetoric, and an intraparty struggle to figure out how far left their policies can go. Sean Sullivan and Annie Linskey report: \u201cThe dynamic has put a squeeze on the Democratic candidates as they begin to lay out their messages. They are being pressed from one side by core Democratic voters hungry for leftist policies favored by the most energized activists and, from the other, by the need to court centrist voters who could be alienated by the party\u2019s turn to the left. \u2026\u00a0 \u201cMost of the presidential field doesn\u2019t identify as socialist. Some candidates are actively rejecting the label or putting a bit of distance between their campaigns and policies such as Medicare-for-all and the Green New Deal, which many of them support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) told reporters she is not 'a democratic socialist'\u00a0while Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said passing Medicare-for-all in the Senate would be difficult: \u2018I\u2019m not going to be one of these presidential candidates that\u2019s not going to tell you the hard truth,\u2019\u00a0Booker said.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said she\u2019s not purposely avoiding talking about the Green New Deal or Medicare-for-all: \u201cAsked how she can combat the \u2018false news going around\u2019 that equates universal health care with \u2018socialism or communism,\u2019 Warren turned the question back on Trump. \u2018We\u2019re caught in this moment where the very foundations of democracy are under attack,\u2019 Warren said. \u2018This is a scary moment for our country.\u2019 \u2026\u00a0Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) \u2026 praised the Green New Deal, which she co-sponsors, as a \u2018multifaceted approach\u2019 and argued that Democrats should embrace the difficult challenge of creating a \u2018green economy.\u2019\u201d -- Former vice president Joe Biden, who still won\u2019t say whether\u00a0he\u2019s running, took aim at Trump during a speech at the University of Pennsylvania. During a Q&A in front of hundreds of students, Biden shared his vision of reversing Trump\u2019s foreign policy and said he\u2019s now more optimistic about the country than ever, saying, \u201cIt is time to restore America\u2019s soul.\u201d (Michael Scherer) -- The self-help author Marianne Williamson has launched a long-shot bid for president based on her philosophy that Americans are responsible for ensuring the health of our democracy. Anna Peele profiles the motivational speaker: \u201cWilliamson and Trump have quite a bit in common. Both are wealthy non-politicians who sought (or seek) the presidency without previously holding public office. Both are charismatic speakers who avoid teleprompters. \u2026 Williamson says she\u2019s not actually trying to beat Trump. \u2026 Trump, she says, is \u2018simply a symptom\u2019 of a condition the other candidates aren\u2019t qualified to heal. \u2026 Williamson traces many of our nation\u2019s psychic wounds to slavery, for which she believes we need to make reparations in the form of a $100 billion, 10-year investment disseminated by a panel of black leaders across fields.\u201d -- The Trump campaign is tackling 2020 in an un-Trumpian way.\u00a0Politico's Alex Isenstadt reports: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is assembling a sprawling, corporate-style reelection campaign with 10 divisions reporting to a single senior adviser, campaign manager Brad Parscale \u2014 a top-down structure that represents everything Trump\u2019s improvisational 2016 effort was not. ...\u00a0The plan isn\u2019t without potential downsides.\u00a0With such a large payroll at such an early stage of the campaign, the campaign runs the risk of over-spending before Democrats have even picked their nominee.\u00a0...\u00a0And in another break from precedent,\u00a0the campaign, with the RNC, is planning an early and aggressive effort to brand the Democratic field as being out-of-the mainstream and socialist.\u201d -- Oregon lawmakers are pushing a bill that would\u00a0lower the voting age to 16.\u00a0From the Oregonian's Douglas Perry: \u201cYounger Oregonians should have 'a chance to participate in the ballot -- about decisions that affect their homes, their clean air, their future, their schools and, as we\u2019ve seen, their very lives,'\u00a0Democratic state Sen.

(Susan Walsh\/AP) THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- Trump said he is in \u201cno rush whatsoever\u201d to see North Korea denuclearize. Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201cTrump and [Kim Jong Un] will meet on Feb. 27 and 28 in Hanoi, following on their meeting in Singapore last June. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he had a \u2018great conversation\u2019 about the trip with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Tuesday morning. Moon\u2019s administration has said it is hopeful that Trump and Kim can achieve \u2018specific\u2019 progress toward denuclearization, although some observers have voiced skepticism about the effectiveness of Trump\u2019s approach. Trump said that while he would \u2018ultimately\u2019 like to see North Korea denuclearize, he has \u2018no pressing time schedule\u2019 because \u2018the sanctions are on.\u2019\u201d -- Trump may attempt to persuade the North Korean leader\u00a0to commit to denuclearization during their second summit by promising him an announcement of peace and an end to the Korean War.\u00a0From the AP's Eric Talmadge: \u201cSuch an announcement could make history. It would be right in line with Trump\u2019s opposition to 'forever wars.' And, coming more than six decades after the fighting essentially ended, it just seems like common sense.\u00a0But, if not done carefully, it could open up a whole new set of problems for Washington. ...\u00a0If done right, it would be a huge boost to Kim\u2019s reputation at home and abroad. And, of course, to the cause of peace on the Korean Peninsula at a time when Pyongyang says it is trying to shift scarce resources away from defense ...\u00a0Washington has a lot to gain, too.\u00a0Trump has said he would welcome a North Korea that is more focused on trade and economic growth. Stability on the peninsula is good for South Korea\u2019s economy and probably for Japan\u2019s as well.\u201d -- Japan\u2019s Fukushima is getting back on its feet eight years after a nuclear meltdown, but the public\u2019s trust has not recovered. Simon Denyer reports: \u201cRadiation levels in the prefecture\u2019s capital city, Fuku\u00adshima, are comparable to the super-safe readings in places such as Hong Kong and London, monitors say. And a massive decontamination effort is still underway. But facts and spreadsheets supplied by the government are one thing. Rebuilding trust among locals may be significantly harder\u2026 at least 24 countries and territories ban some produce from Fukushima. Taiwan, South Korea and China still impose a total food ban. The United States prohibits Fukushima produce such as mushrooms, leafy vegetables and broccoli. Fishermen now only ply the seas two days a week.\u201d -- The White House is launching an effort to end the criminalization of homosexuality around the world. NBC News\u2019s Josh Lederman reports: \u201cU.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, the highest-profile openly gay person in the Trump administration, is leading the effort, which kicks off Tuesday evening in Berlin. The U.S. embassy is flying in LGBT activists from across Europe for a strategy dinner to plan to push for decriminalization in places that still outlaw homosexuality \u2014 mostly concentrated in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean. \u2026 Narrowly focused on criminalization, rather than broader LGBT issues like same-sex marriage, the campaign was conceived partly in response to the recent reported execution by hanging of a young gay man in Iran, the Trump administration\u2019s top geopolitical foe.\u201d -- Egyptian officials detained a New York Times reporter and then forced him to return to London. The Times\u2019s Declan Walsh reports: \u201cThe move against the correspondent, David D. Kirkpatrick, is an escalation of a severe crackdown against the news media under Egypt\u2019s strongman leader, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Egyptian journalists have borne the brunt of Mr. el-Sisi\u2019s repression, with dozens imprisoned or forced into exile. But of late, a lack of pushback from the United States has emboldened Egypt\u2019s security forces to take stronger action against representatives of Western news outlets, including expulsion.\u201d -- Two American women who left the country to marry Islamic State\u00a0militants want to return home after escaping the self-declared caliphate together and surrendering to American troops in the Syrian desert. From the Times\u2019s Rukmini Callimachi and Catherine Porter: \u201cBoth women \u2026 said they were trying to figure out how to have their passports reissued, and how to win the sympathy of the two nations they scorned. \u2026 In a tweet this weekend, President Trump criticized allies including Britain, France and Germany for not taking back hundreds of ISIS prisoners captured on the battlefield. \u2026 The president made no mention of American women who had married ISIS fighters and whom the United States had not returned home. Both [women] said they had not been visited by American officials since their capture last month. \u201cA small number of Americans \u2014 as few as 59, according to data tracked by the George Washington University Program on Extremism \u2014 are known to have traveled to Syria to join ISIS. Nearly all the American men captured in battle have been repatriated, but it is unclear why some of the American women and their children \u2014 at least 13 known to The Times \u2014 have not been.\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: A libertarian congressman who has previously expressed opposition to some of Trump's policies posed this question: Bernie Sanders touted his fundraising haul after he launched his second presidential campaign: A Times reporter criticized Bernie's theory of the case: An NBC News reporter shared this piece of trivia after Sanders picked up an endorsement from his fellow senator from Vermont: A Burlington Free Press editor noted that Elizabeth Warren is paying to run ads for herself when someone does a Google search for Bernie Sanders: Donald Trump Jr. suggested Sen.

By 2030, some 85 percent of extremely poor people\u2014those living on less than $1.90 a day\u2014will live in fragile settings, affected or threatened by war and other shocks. The number of armed conflicts around the world is 65 percent higher today than it was a decade ago. Many of these conflicts are civil wars, which tend to last longer than interstate wars and are much more likely to recur after a peace agreement has been reached.\u00a0As a result, displacement is lasting longer\u2014at least ten years for the average refugee. During those years, many of the displaced are unable to work or go to school. The host countries are often overburdened: almost 90 percent of the world\u2019s 24.5 million refugees live in low and middle-income countries, which already struggle to educate their populations and expand their economies. An influx of refugees can threaten tentative progress toward development. And when host countries do develop, refugees are often left behind.\u201d\u00a0 -- New York Times, \u201cHousing Is\u00a0Already in a Slump. So It (Probably) Can\u2019t Cause a Recession,\u201d by Conor Dougherty: \u201cThe gist is this: The United States may or may not enter a recession this year, but if it does, housing is unlikely to be the cause, because it never really recovered in the first place. 'Housing is not in a position to lead this thing down,'\u00a0said Edward Leamer, an economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. How much it can help prolong the overall recovery is another matter. Home sales and prices have been sluggish in the face of rising interest rates. Still, the pace of construction, combined with pent-up demand from young adults, suggests that the sector should at least remain stable in the face of uncertainty elsewhere.\u201d\u00a0 -- American Interest, \u201cThe Long Freedom Slump,\u201d by Larry Diamond: \u201cIf you look past the seven advanced industrial democracies among [the world\u2019s] 27 largest countries, you find four democracies straining under the weight of corruption and crime (Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines, and South Africa); four countries where elected leaders have stifled democratic institutions or possibilities (Russia, Turkey, Bangladesh, and Tanzania); four countries where, in different ways, the military effectively dominates (Pakistan, Thailand, Myanmar, and Egypt); three entrenched dictatorships (China, Vietnam, and Iran); three huge arenas of political pluralism (India, Indonesia, and Nigeria); one African country where the door to democratic reform seems to be closing again (the DRC); and one\u2014just one\u2014with a real but tenuous possibility of democratic progress (Ethiopia).\u201d HOT ON THE LEFT: \u201cBurberry sweatshirt featuring noose for drawstrings condemned for evoking suicide, lynching,\u201d from Reis Thebault: \u201cAnother fashion debut, another designer brand facing accusations of insensitivity. This time around, the offending label was Burberry, a company best known for its distinctive check pattern \u2014 at least, until it showed off one of its latest items at London Fashion Week on Sunday: a hooded sweatshirt that featured, instead of the usual drawstrings, a rope tied into a noose. Observers quickly condemned the sweatshirt and accused the fashion house of evoking racist lynching imagery and of being insensitive to suicide. Burberry later responded with an apology and said it was removing the sweatshirt from its collection.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT: \u201cIn blow to Obama Presidential Center backers, judge allows lawsuit challenging Chicago's Jackson Park location to proceed,\u201d from the Chicago Tribune: \u201cIn a setback to plans to build the Obama Presidential Center on Chicago\u2019s South Side lakefront, a federal judge ruled Tuesday that a lawsuit challenging its location can proceed. U.S. Judge John Robert Blakey said in a written ruling that the environmental group Protect Our Parks has enough legal ground to bring some of its objections before him. \u2026 The ruling to allow the suit to proceed is significant because it could delay construction for months, and potentially raise the question of whether the $500 million sprawling presidential campus can be built at all on lakefront property in Jackson Park.\u201d \u00a0 DAYBOOK: Trump will have lunch with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and welcome the Austrian chancellor to the White House.

Here's a look back at his long career:","23":"The cable TV talking heads told us the 2018 midterms were about the far left grabbing control of the Democratic Party. Wrong. It was the year of the moderates who flipped the House and won governor and Senate (e.g., Nevada, Arizona) races. Republicans were convinced the tax cuts would be a big winner. Nope. The tax cuts were a political loser, did not lead to huge increases in wages (although stock buybacks are all the rage) and were so heavily tilted toward corporations and the rich that a backlash has formed, namely widespread support for taxing the rich. A lot. Well, President Trump\u2019s focus on Islamic terrorism once more puts Democrats on the defensive when it comes to national security. Hardly. Trump\u2019s fearmongering and vilification of the press inspires kooks (in the Pittsburgh synagogue, in the Florida mail bomber) to act on their impulses, underscoring that Trump has made us less safe by ignoring (if not encouraging) right-wing domestic terrorists. In fact, from Russia to Saudi Arabia, Trump\u2019s foreign policy reeks of self-interest to the detriment of our national interests. (This week we learned, \u201cThe Trump administration sought to rush the transfer of American nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia in potential violation of the law, a new report from the House Oversight and Reform Committee alleges.\u201d) It often seems as if Republicans are playing from a musty, out-of-date playbook. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has a brilliant (he thinks) idea: Make Democrats vote on the Green New Deal. But wait. Fighting climate change is really popular. (What if Democrats embrace the opportunity to paint Republicans as irresponsible Luddites and, say, vote \u201cpresent\u201d on the resolution to signal their readiness to debate real solutions?) It may be counterintuitive, but Democrats might run successfully on soaking the rich, undertaking a major push on green energy (\u201cJobs, jobs, jobs,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi likes to say) and making America respected in the world again. It\u2019s not inconceivable that a president who favored the rich and weakened America internationally (e.g., siding with the Russians and elevating Kim Jong Un) could be vulnerable to Democrats who run left on taxes\/the economy and discover their inner hawks on foreign policy. The parties\u2019 positions on major policy issues have been shifting over time, and in adopting a know-nothing brand of populism (except on tax cuts, which go to the rich), Trump shoved his party into the intellectual abyss. They oppose free-trade deals, robust immigration, fighting global warming, fiscal sobriety and standing up to Russia and other international bullies. Well, if they insist on that mishmash of anti-growth domestic policies and international retreat, that\u2019s their prerogative. However, this gives Democrats an opportunity to spruce up and modernize their own agenda. What we used to think was politically dangerous (gun safety, tax hikes) might be the very things that energize their base and keep those suburban voters in their fold. Can Democrats go overboard, playing into Trump\u2019s accusations that they are \u201csocialists\u201d (although Republicans might find out a lot of Americans believe in \u201csocialist\u201d ideas like universal health care coverage) and favor \u201copen borders\u201d? Well, the more savvy Democrats are talking about things like incremental health-care improvements, reentering the Paris climate accords and spending on a variety of border security measures. If they keep that up, they might just flip the script and put together an eclectic but appealing message.

Whether the timing was intended or not, two sweeping new U.S. indictments against a globe-spanning Chinese conglomerate are casting a long shadow over a critical round of talks this week between the negotiating teams led by Liu and U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer. The indictments also added to a sense in both capitals that the U.S.-China rivalry is in full swing, and that a far-reaching deal that would satisfy Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping may not materialize this week even if the two sides agree to a temporary truce. Negotiators this week are hoping to reach an accord that could at least avert a new 25\u00a0percent levy on $200\u00a0billion worth of Chinese goods \u2014 tariffs that Trump has ordered to begin\u00a0March\u00a02, absent a deal. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that there will be an ugly showdown between the two countries at the end of the talks, but it could be a dormant volcano that becomes active every few months and adds uncertainty to the global trade and economy,\u201d Zhang Yansheng, secretary general of the academic committee at the National Development and Reform Commission, China\u2019s powerful economic planning body, told reporters Tuesday. Although China has offered significant purchases of U.S. exports to close the trade deficit and promised to crack down on intellectual property theft \u2014 issues underscored by the American indictment against Huawei \u2014 it has not yet offered an acceptable mechanism that would let the United States hold it accountable for those promises, according to scholars and trade group representatives who have spoken to U.S. negotiators. Additionally, the more fundamental U.S. demands for China to open its market and cut government direction and support for state-owned companies \u2014 a central tenet of the Communist Party\u2019s tightly managed economic model \u2014 remain a nonstarter for Beijing. \u201cThere\u2019s still a pretty significant gap on structural and tech transfer issues,\u201d said one American trade association representative who met recently with Lighthizer and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear that the wide gap that everyone knows exists has been narrowed in any way.\u201d This week\u2019s talks will be led by Lighthizer, a trade hard-liner who is deeply skeptical of China\u2019s willingness to change its trade practices and has been privately dismissive of progress made to date. The talks in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House come amid signs that China\u2019s slowing economy is hurting some U.S. companies. Computer chip maker Nvidia cited \u201cdeteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China\u201d on Monday, as it slashed its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by $500\u00a0million. Likewise, Caterpillar missed its quarterly earnings target by the biggest amount in more than 10 years after construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region fell \u201cdue to lower demand in China.\u201d Even if there is a temporary deal that includes China buying large quantities of U.S. agricultural products, the question of how to enforce issues such as intellectual property protection remains a key concern. Lighthizer has discussed using the threat of renewed tariffs to ensure compliance, an idea the Chinese reject as creating uncertainty over future trade and investment flows, according to people familiar with the negotiations. Meanwhile in China, analysts and state media outlets have reiterated that Beijing will not budge over the deep changes to its economic model that the United States is seeking.\u00a0 \u201cThere is great uncertainty\u201d about whether a deal can be reached with the United States, said Wang Yong, a professor at Peking University\u2019s school of international studies. \u201cJudging from China\u2019s current domestic politics, it can be said that the space of making a very clear promise to the United States, the possibility of making a concession, is relatively small.\u201d The United States needs to lower its demands and give China more time, said Wang Yong, a professor at Peking University\u2019s school of international studies. \u201cFor China, it has had its development model for so many years,\u201d he said. \u201cReform or adjustment is not the work of a single day.\u201d In recent weeks, Xi has sent signals to the Communist Party in study sessions with cadres to firmly uphold China\u2019s existing model and brace for \u201cpolitical risks,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). \u201cThe Chinese have given no signs that they\u2019re committed to comprehensive market liberalization, and recently the signals have only gotten more intense in the other direction,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cIf they are preparing to make major concessions and engage in thoroughgoing marketization, then they\u2019re keeping it an amazing secret.\u201d At a time when Chinese leaders are bracing the country for the prospect of a protracted tussle with the United States, the indictments against Huawei, an icon of Chinese technological prowess, have reinforced their rallying cry. A 13-count indictment filed in New York City against the company, two affiliates and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, details allegations of bank and wire fraud. A separate 10-count indictment in Washington state also charges the two Huawei affiliates with conspiring to steal trade secrets and obstruction of justice. Separately on Monday, U.S. officials formally asked Canada to extradite Meng, who is wanted in the United States on charges that she defrauded banks to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran. Beijing has been outraged by the U.S. pursuit of Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei. \u201cThe Chinese have been clearly portraying this through the state media as a political play, and they will try to use it domestically as another example of American political scheming,\u201d said\u00a0Andrew Collier of Orient Capital Research, a Hong Kong-based financial firm. \u201cBut behind the scenes, their negotiators will be pedaling furiously, trying to get the trade spat out of the way.\u201d Lester Ross, a long-standing member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing and head of law firm Wilmer Hale\u2019s practice in the city, said the Chinese leadership wants to go through with this week\u2019s negotiations and seek a deal  at a time when its economic engine is sputtering. \u201cThe Chinese seem determined to carry on with the trade track despite the discomfort of the Huawei case,\u201d Ross said. Some U.S. officials, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has pushed for a deal with China sooner rather than later, have also played down the link between the trade talks and law enforcement actions against Huawei, which have been ongoing for years. Trump \u2014 whose approval ratings sagged during the partial government shutdown \u2014 is anxious to hammer out an accord that he can bill as a great achievement, according to several individuals familiar with White House discussions who were not authorized to discuss them publicly. His administration remains divided between trade hawks such as Lighthizer and White House adviser Peter Navarro, who are intent on forcing China to make fundamental changes in its state-directed economic model, and those, such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who want to avoid further disruption to global trade flows and calm roiling financial markets. At the White House on Monday, Mnuchin said he anticipates \u201csignificant progress\u201d this week. The talks will focus on U.S. concerns over intellectual property protections, Chinese regulations governing joint ventures with foreign companies and enforcement measures, he said. \u201cWe expect when we get a deal, that deal will be enforced,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been an acknowledgment by China that they understand that.\u201d Still, Lighthizer\u2019s presence at the negotiating table this week could mean that securing a deal will not be easy. The trade representative has been entrusted by Trump to deliver several deals, including pacts with Canada, Mexico and South Korea, while the president rejected earlier efforts by Mnuchin and Ross to compromise with China, said Kennedy of CSIS. \u201cThe Chinese may have the wrong impression that the president will shift among advisers depending on the day of the week, that he himself doesn\u2019t have any bottom line, or that he\u2019s more concerned about the stock market than about fundamental economic issues,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cI think that\u2019s a misreading of the landscape in Washington.\u201d","25":"Besieged on seemingly every front, Tesla is betting that the unveiling of a smaller battery-powered SUV, the Model Y, will reinvigorate the Silicon Valley upstart with the dazzle and fanfare that made it one of America\u2019s most valuable automakers. But executives also hope it will distract from practically everything else the car company has faced recently, from financial land mines to courtroom brawls to doubts over the survivability of Elon Musk as Tesla\u2019s visionary marketer-in-chief. Musk revealed the Model Y in Los Angeles Thursday night in what has for him been the friendliest possible territory: before an audience of boosters, inside a Tesla design studio, on the stage that helped make him a star. The car is expected to launch next fall starting at $47,000, with a lower-ranged version selling for $39,000 debuting the following spring. It will also complete one of the nerdy billionaire\u2019s longest-running gags, in which the cars\u2019 names \u2014 S, 3, X and Y \u2014 appear to spell out the word \u201csexy.\u201d \u201cWe are bringing 'sexy\u2019 back quite literally,\u201d he told the cheering crowd. Tesla\u2019s fifth major auto debut in 15 years could prove to be its most important and profitable reveal. Roomier than its Model 3 sedan and more compact than the hulking Model X, it will mark Tesla\u2019s first swing at the \u201ccrossover\u201d that has become America\u2019s most popular type of car. New Tesla unveilings have traditionally been some of the most energizing events in the company\u2019s history. When Musk revealed the Model 3 sedan in 2016, he positioned the electric car as a revolutionary act toward saving the world. An uproarious crowd showered him with praise and a landslide of reservations. \u201cYou did it!\u201d one onlooker screamed. But Tesla now endures a major news event nearly every day \u2014 and instead of celebrations, they\u2019re often centered on Musk\u2019s slap-fights with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla\u2019s mass layoffs and store closures, or the company\u2019s stuttering rollouts of hardware and technology, often marred by years of delays. For Musk, the unveiling is \u201ckind of like going back to your wubby. This is his comfortable place,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, the senior automotive research director for the advisory firm Gartner. But the Model Y is also, he said, \u201cthe product they can\u2019t screw up. \u2026 There\u2019s only so many times you can hit the adrenaline pump on Tesla and get a reaction.\u201d The Model Y will cost about 10 percent more than Tesla\u2019s cheapest car, offers a shorter driving range and looks like a beefier Model 3, the sedan with which it will share about three-quarters of its parts. But the event did not go off without a hitch: Visitors redirected to a Tesla website for designing and buying the car said it appeared to be offline. The unveil followed a winding trip down Tesla\u2019s recent history, in which Musk, dressed in special Tesla-branded Nike sneakers, talked about early doubts about starting an electric-car company (\u201cstupidity squared\u201d), extolled other Tesla vehicles like the Model X (\u201ca Faberg\u00e9 egg meets a spaceship\u201d), and spoke candidly about his chaotic 2018 (\u201clike aging five years in one\u201d). The Model 3 sedan, while still a shrimp compared to its much larger gas-powered rivals, has become the best-selling electric car in the world. And some analysts expect the Model Y could be much bigger: Crossover SUVs like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V dominate the modern car dealership and are rapidly gaining in markets across China and Europe, where Tesla has placed its biggest hopes for long-term profit. Tesla is hopeful Thursday\u2019s unveiling will trigger a surge of deposits from would-be buyers, giving Tesla an instant bundle of interest-free money that will help it boost its cash supply. It will also signal to investors eyeing its stock price, which has slumped more than 10 percent this year, that the company can still gin up demand. But that hype cycle could bring its own dangers. Shortly after the Model 3 reveal in 2016, more than 100,000 hopeful buyers plunked down a $1,000 deposit to preorder the $35,000 sedan. Many dropped their reservations or ended up shelling out more for a pricier car in the following years; the Model 3 only went up for sale at that price last month. The Model Y will be more affordable than Tesla\u2019s high-end Model X, but it will likely sail way over what the average American driver can afford. Years after Musk said his \u201cmaster plan\u201d was to sell cool electric cars for the middle class, Teslas are still mostly seen as status symbols for the rich and aspirational: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, for instance, announced he had one Thursday at a Ways and Means hearing. Some analysts question whether Tesla\u2019s reveal of another upscale car will really help. The company can no longer lure buyers in with a $7,500 tax incentive, which was chopped in half at the start of the year, and Musk himself has acknowledged that Teslas are \u201cstill too expensive for most people.\u201d Demand, he said in January, is \u201cinsanely high,\u201d but buyers \u201cjust don\u2019t have enough money in their bank account.\u201d That price wall \u2014 coupled with America\u2019s shrugging disinterest in electric cars \u2014 has served to cage Tesla behind a seemingly shrinking niche. Teslas also remain largely a West Coast fling: More than 40 percent of the company\u2019s sales last year were in California. Most automakers reveal new cars alongside detailed launch plans, with the implicit guarantee that they\u2019re primed and ready to begin building and selling en masse. With Tesla, it\u2019s not only unclear when Model Ys will hit the road, but where even they\u2019ll get made: Musk has hinted that the car could be produced at its Gigafactory outside Reno, Nevada, though that plant makes batteries and would need an entirely separate assembly line for cars. Tesla says it wants to launch a factory in China, but nothing\u2019s been built, and making the car there would open the company to a raft of tariff and logistical nightmares. Analysts say the company\u2019s only current car-making factory, in Fremont, Calif., is so tapped out that changing its production lines could damage the company\u2019s bottom line. The company continues to blow past dire financial milestones, including two mass layoffs in the last year and growing uncertainty about its national footprint. Musk abruptly announced last month that the company would close most of its showrooms \u2014 a huge retreat for a company that was celebrating ribbon-cuttings a few months ago \u2014 then just as abruptly said it would be keeping many open, following a revolt from investors, landlords and fans. Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said the double U-turn looked \u201clike amateur hour.\u201d To save money, Musk also said Tesla will raise prices about 3 percent across the board and sell the cars only online \u2014 an unproven model that will force buyers to use a website when committing to one of the most expensive products they\u2019ll probably ever buy. Tesla will be expected to build more cars even as it endures more public scrutiny than ever before, with regulators, lenders and whistleblowers all breathing down the company\u2019s neck. A federal judge is currently weighing whether to hold Musk in contempt after the SEC said he violated a settlement deal reached near the end of last year. Musk\u2019s attorneys have argued that the settlement he agreed to \u2014 which required he get company preapproval for tweets that could surprise investors \u2014 was an \u201cunprecedented overreach\u201d that would trample on his First Amendment rights. The SEC, which Musk has said he does not \u201crespect,\u201d has until Tuesday to give the judge its reply. The Model Y also faces challenges in the market where it will have to compete with a growing lineup of sleek, electric crossovers from major brands, like Volvo\u2019s Polestar 2. Tesla boosters say the Model Y will be red meat for the company\u2019s often-rabidly enthusiastic fan base. And they expect, like the Model 3, that it could fuel a buyer-reservation binge that could help propel the company through financial doubts or missed deadlines. But others aren\u2019t entirely convinced it will be enough \u2014 or that the adoration Musk is counting on will last. \u201cThanks to the quality issues and scandals over the last year, the brand\u2019s halo has started to dull,\u201d Jessica Caldwell, the executive director of industry analysis at Edmunds, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cThe Model Y will debut with promises of grandeur, (but) if there are any chinks in Tesla\u2019s brand armor, this vehicle will expose them.\u201d","26":"President Trump recently delayed imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports, stating that a deal was \u201cvery close.\u201d While the details of any deal remain unclear, Trump\u2019s aggressive stance on trade has divided opinion. Protected industries, including steel, claim that Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong trade actions\u201d are partly responsible for new jobs and better pay. However, economists, along with a chorus of export-oriented industry groups, still insist tariffs do far more harm than good. With an announcement looming, it\u2019s worth taking stock of what we know about the effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs and economic policy. Jobs are being created, but wages are still low One justification for tariffs on Chinese imports is the claim that trade protection creates jobs. Taxing foreign goods increases demand for domestic products, bolstering production and sending more Americans to work. There are some numbers that support this argument. New jobs have been added in every month of Trump\u2019s presidency, averaging 200,000 per month. This includes roughly 450,000 manufacturing jobs. After shedding 5 million jobs from 2001 to 2010, the manufacturing sector has enjoyed a soft rebound. In addition, there is anecdotal evidence of new employment in protected industries, including 1,100 jobs at the U.S. Steel\u2019s Fairfield Works. Supporters of Trump\u2019s trade protection claim that job creation outpaces losses from tariffs 20:1. However, this may not be the result of tariffs. The United States has enjoyed over 100 straight months of uninterrupted job growth. This means that strong performance under Trump cannot be attributed to recent policy shifts. Furthermore, most of those jobs are in services, not manufacturing. Services employment grew dramatically after the Great Recession, increasing by about 17 million. Moreover, the raw job numbers do not tell us anything about the \u201cquality\u201d of those jobs. A closer look at wages is less encouraging. Manufacturing wages improved slightly in 2018, growing by 3 percent. Yet, wages plateaued in the last several months, showing little improvement in the last several months. More generally, wage growth still lags behind pre-Great Recession numbers. Prices are holding steady for consumers but not for manufacturers Economists argue that the main problem with trade barriers is that they increase costs. Even if jobs are created, consumers lose by paying more for everyday goods and services. Thus far, consumer prices in some major industries are holding steady, including the automotive industry, where steel tariffs were expected to raise the sticker prices at car dealerships. Steady prices may help explain why holiday spending was better than expected. Holiday spending is a common indication of consumer confidence, and retailers, particularly online, reported strong performance. Yet, behind the scenes, prices have increased significantly for producers. Steel prices rose 20 percent in 2018, leading to loud protests from producers like Caterpillar and Ford. It is likely that consumer prices will rise soon if U.S.-China tensions are not alleviated. President Trump has conceded as much, admitting that iPhone prices would rise as a result of tariffs but claiming this is just one more reason to move production to the United States. The trade deficit is still growing A central theme of Trump\u2019s rhetoric is standing up to trade discrimination around the world, which, in his view, accelerates the decline of American manufacturing. Here, there is far less evidence that Trump\u2019s strategy is working as planned. The trade deficit \u2014 which Trump often cited as evidence of America\u2019s mistreatment at the hands of its partners \u2014 continues to grow. The deficit in goods trade approached $800 billion by November 2018, a 10-year high. Tariffs have not stemmed the inflow of consumer goods. In fact, there is some evidence that trade barriers actually increased imports of key inputs like steel as producers hoarded supply before prices got too high. Furthermore, there is lost market access. Goods originally destined for China are suffering from Beijing retaliatory measures. It is not easy \u2014 or cheap \u2014 to find alternatives in the global marketplace. The result has been piles of soybeans with nowhere to go. The trade war has had real consequences Trump\u2019s tariff policy has not yet led, as feared, to sweeping job losses and rocketing prices. Nor has the U.S. economy slipped into the deep recession that some predicted. However, that does not necessarily mean, as Trump claimed, that trade wars are \u201ceasy to win.\u201d There are clear costs to trade conflict. Buried in the news about U.S. Steel\u2019s investment in Alabama is that tariffs have already cost GM $1 billion \u2014 leading the company to announce up to 14,000 layoffs. There may also be broader international consequences. The U.S. now faces unprecedented levels of trade litigation in Geneva, and key trade partners have sought more predictable allies elsewhere. All of America\u2019s top 5 trade partners continue to negotiate new agreements with one another \u2014 deals that leave the United States on the sidelines. Whatever happens on or around the March 1 deadline, there have clearly been significant economic repercussions from the year-long trade fight.

Cats are the Internet. So while videos of cats on YouTube are not a new concept, cooking with them might be. Popular YouTube channel JunsKitchen stars three house cats \u2014 Kohaku, Poki and Nagi \u2014 who watch as their owner Jun Yoshizuki prepares classic Japanese staples such as omurice, ramen and tofu. JunsKitchen is one of four YouTube channels run by Yoshizuki, 29, and his wife, Rachel, 30. While most of their channels focus on their life and travels in Japan, JunsKitchen features basic cooking tutorials. But what makes these special, and popular with fans, is the soothing atmosphere Jun creates with meticulously edited videos. He posted just seven videos to the channel last year. \u201cAs someone who suffers from depression and anxiety; Rachel and Jun\u2019s videos have become a form of meditation for me,\u201d one user wrote on Reddit. \u201cIf you ever are feeling overwhelmed, I highly recommend shutting down your brain for a few [minutes] and watching some of their videos.\u201d Millions of people are doing just that. Each of the channel\u2019s 25 videos have more than 1 million views. The most popular, with more than 37 million views, is a tutorial on polishing a rusty knife. In it, Jun spins a charming tale of purchasing a banged up traditional Japanese knife from a man in a recycling store who may or may not have conned him. As his cats look on and an upbeat rock song plays, Jun polishes the knife until it gleams. The moment he holds the restored knife and demonstrates its sharpness is triumphant. A cat looks on seemingly with awe as Jun carves a radish rose. \u201cAs soon as people got a hold of \u2018cat watching man cook,\u2019 people started sharing his videos everywhere,\u201d Rachel said. Rachel and Jun already had a loyal community of followers before they started focusing on JunsKitchen. They\u2019ve been on YouTube for seven years and started their first channel, Rachel and Jun, as a hobby while they were in a long-distance relationship. They both live in the Japan\u2019s Fukuoka prefecture and generally post videos of life in Japan for English-speaking viewers \u2014 like an idiot\u2019s guide to Japanese apartments or a trip to a Fox Village in Japan. JunsKitchen surpassed that \u201cmain\u201d channel in subscribers a little more than a year ago. Their three cats are essentially characters in the videos, with their own personalities. You\u2019ll most likely find Kohaku in frame while Jun\u2019s cooking \u2014 on the fridge or in a chair alongside Nagi. Jun often passes ingredients to them for inspection as he makes a meal, especially if it\u2019s a piece of fish or a can of tuna. Watching Kohaku watch Jun, it\u2019s easy to graft emotions and coy facial expressions. The comments are littered with musings on the cats\u2019 moods. To capture these magical moments, Rachel and Jun say it takes countless hours of editing before they hit publish. It may take Jun 40 minutes without filming to make sushi \u2026 for the cats. (And, yes, there\u2019s a video of sushi for the cats.) YouTube is pretty much a full-time job at the moment. Jun said he has a \u201cside-job\u201d as a translator. They have T-shirts for fans and a Patreon with 1,200 supporters at the time this article published. There\u2019s also dedicated community on Discord, a chat app for online gaming, where their supporters talk about their own cats, the latest video from Rachel and Jun, or their hobbies: cooking, gaming, even book recommendations. Eric Colwell, 24, a chat moderator for their community on Discord, found JunsKitchen a few years ago. For him, the cooking tutorials are relaxing, and he said he would rather Jun share a video every few months than the weekly vlogs you see from other YouTubers. \u201cIt shows that they really love them and care about [the videos],\u201d Colwell said. Videos often start with getting ingredients. Japanese dishes tend to depend on seasonal ingredients, Jun said, and it\u2019s an opportunity to show the countryside of Japan. Jun is from Aichi prefecture, and his grandparents and extended family were farmers. For Jun, there\u2019s something \u201cmore interesting and attractive\u201d filming those wider expanses than Tokyo or another urban sprawl. \u201cThe food that\u2019s in season tastes the best,\u201d Jun said. In one video, Jun goes to a mushroom farm before making sukiyaki \u2014 a traditional Japanese dish \u2014 back at his apartment. Jun shows details that you wouldn\u2019t see shopping at a supermarket, and he said he has an appreciation for the time spent and a curiosity for how dishes are made. Rachel said if there\u2019s a spot at a restaurant where you can see the chefs preparing the food, \u201cJun wants to sit there\u201d and he\u2019ll often ask the chef how certain parts of a meal were made. In the videos, the camera never focuses on Jun, just the food and his cats. Those are the stars. \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself a chef or talented or skillful or anything,\u201d Jun said.","28":"Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who is weighing a 2020 presidential bid, told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d that President Trump made \u201csome real mistakes\u201d in declaring a national emergency over border security. \u201cI don\u2019t think declaring, using emergency powers was the right thing to do here,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve exaggerated what\u2019s going on at the border \u2014 but we do have issues down there.\u201d Hogan said he agreed with the decision by Maryland\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Brian E. Frosh, to join more than a dozen other states in filing a lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s executive order. Frosh did not need the governor\u2019s approval to file the lawsuit, because the Democratic-controlled General Assembly has given the attorney general blanket authority to sue the federal government. The Hogan interview, which aired Wednesday morning, was the governor\u2019s latest venture onto the national stage after eschewing such attention during his first term in office. Hogan, who is being courted by the \u201cNever Trump\u201d wing of the Republican Party, appeared on CNN earlier this month. In each interview, the governor left the door open on a possible presidential campaign. Hogan said he has been approached about running, adding, \u201cI guess the best way to put is I haven\u2019t thrown them out of my office.\u201d In transcript excerpts distributed by CBS but not included in the broadcast, Hogan said Trump looks \u201cpretty weak\u201d in a general election but doesn\u2019t appear at the moment to be vulnerable to a primary challenge. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that\u2019s going to look like three months, six months from now, depending on how he might soften,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThe issue I\u2019m concerned about is he has a very low reelect number. .\u2009.\u2009. So the chance of him losing in a general election is pretty good. I\u2019m not saying he couldn\u2019t win, but he\u2019s pretty weak in the general election.\u201d In the aired interview, the governor described Trump as \u201chis own worst enemy.\u201d Hogan said that at times the president acts \u201cirrationally\u201d and does things \u201cin a way that aren\u2019t great for the Republican Party and for the country or for him and his agenda.\u201d Asked if he thought Trump was fit to be president, Hogan, who did not vote for Trump in 2016, said he was \u201cnot in any position to judge the fitness of the president.\u201d He said he doesn\u2019t like the tone that Trump uses. \u201cI do believe there are people in Congress and other leaders in the Republican Party who have not stood up when they disagree or when they think the president is doing something wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve not been afraid to do that.\u201d","29":"For decades, experts have been predicting the death of small, independent bookstores. In the 1990s, the villains were mega-stores, like Barnes & Noble and Borders. The new millennium saw the rise of online bookselling, which offers far more titles and lower prices than neighborhood shops. (You know who we\u2019re talking about, and the founder of that company also owns this newspaper.) Then came e-books, which further cut into sales. When veteran Washington Post editor Bradley Graham and his wife, Lissa Muscatine, purchased the venerable store Politics and Prose in 2011, they painted a grim picture of the business for sellers: \u201cOver the past 20 years, the number of independents tracked by the American Booksellers Association has fallen by about 66 percent,\u201d Graham and Muscatine wrote in a Washington Post essay. \u201cFor those surviving today, operating margins generally remain thin, with hundreds of stores reporting no profit at all.\u201d Yet somehow, they appear to be thriving, especially in the capital. Over the past three years, Washingtonians have welcomed new bookstores in every quadrant of the city. Farther afield, shops have appeared from Reston to Annapolis. Pop-ups bring books to unexpected places. Even the well-known booksellers have expanded: Dupont\u2019s Kramerbooks took over a neighboring storefront; Alexandria\u2019s kid-centric Hooray for Books doubled in size; Politics and Prose has opened two satellite locations, far from its Upper Northwest base, at the Wharf and Union Market. What\u2019s fueling this growth, sellers say, is a connection with the community instead of fighting Amazon for every dime. \u201cThere\u2019s no universe in which I can compete with online retailers, because that\u2019s how publishing works,\u201d says Ally Kirkpatrick, who opened Old Town Books in a 200-year-old building near the Potomac in November. \u201cOur competitive edge is events,\u201d she says, whether that\u2019s gathering two dozen people for a lively book club discussion, hosting author signings or organizing a series about the craft of writing. \u201cI feel like everybody I meet in the shop is the right kind of customer. They want to hang out and meet other book lovers.\u201d And, of course, chat about what they\u2019ve read. Others see community service as a chief role. Angela Maria Spring worked as a bookseller for 18 years, spanning a Waldenbooks in her native Albuquerque to Politics and Prose, but she reexamined her life after the last election. \u201c2016 was an intense year for people of color,\u201d says Spring, who is of Panamanian and Puerto Rican descent. \u201cI thought, \u2018What kind of bookseller do I want to be?\u2019\u00ad\u00a0\u201d Although she enjoyed her job at Politics and Prose, \u201cI felt like I wasn\u2019t serving my community,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d like to build a bookstore that centers on us and celebrates who we are as authors and readers.\u201d The result was Duende District, a pop-up bookstore that places works by authors of color in wine bars, museums and a Union Market bodega. What distinguishes this new wave of bookstores is that their individual personalities shine through what they share in common. Any bookstore is going to be eager to sell you a copy of Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cBecoming\u201d or Tara Westover\u2019s \u201cEducated\u201d \u2014 as well as notecards, an RBG enamel badge or a pair of literary-themed socks. But each of these shops fills a distinct and different niche that brings its audience together. \u201cI never wanted a traditional store,\u201d says Angela Maria Spring, the founder of Duende District. \u201cI wanted to play with the model.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what the New Mexico native is doing, curating pop-up offerings of books by and about people of color at a changing variety of unexpected spaces. She has filled two large bookcases at Walls of Books, a used bookstore in Petworth; curated a selection inside the bookshop at the National Museum of Women in the Arts; and chosen books for kids and adults at Toli Moli, a bodega inside Union Market. Most recently, she stocked a waist-high book rack inside Dio, a woman-owned wine bar on H Street NE. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s important that the business is serving a very specific part of the community that isn\u2019t being tapped,\u201d Spring explains. The selection varies by location: Dio has romance novels and new fiction, while Toli Moli\u2019s titles lean toward the Asian diaspora and books by foodies, such as chef Edward Lee. For Spring, this is part of the appeal of pop-ups and temporary spaces. \u201cWe can take it anywhere, into any community,\u201d Spring says. \u201cIt\u2019s as big or small as you want it, but you can get a rich amount of books in there.\u201d Multiple locations: Dio Wine Bar, 904 H St. NE; National Museum of Women in the Arts, 1250 New York Ave. NW; Toli Moli, 1309 Fifth St. NE; Walls of Books, 3325 Georgia Ave. NW. The line of strollers begins building well before story time in the mornings on Tuesdays and Fridays, stretching up and down the passageway outside East City Bookshop\u2019s front doors. Inside, parents and caregivers watch as small children determinedly climb the shop\u2019s wide stairs or settle onto the floor with a book. It\u2019s evidence of how much East City, which opened in April 2016, has become part of the Capitol Hill community. It\u2019s a place where residents drop in to pick up the latest bestseller or grab a cute gift, such as journals, literary-themed socks or enamel pins. A variety of book clubs include those for readers in their 20s and 30s (e.g., the CHILLY Ps, or the Capitol Hill Interesting Literature League for Young Professionals), a social-justice club, and groups just for teens and tweens. Covering similar topics: the W(h)ine & Angst Book Club, for those over 21 who want to discuss books for or about teenagers with a glass of red or white in hand.  645 Pennsylvania Ave. SE. Hannah Oliver Depp created a buzz on the Washington bookstore scene over the holidays, launching Loyalty Bookstore as a pop-up in Silver Spring at a former barbecue restaurant, filling it with books, children gathered for story times, and a variety of giftable items from local makers, including prints and stationery. Now Depp, who previously worked at Politics and Prose and the Word Bookstore in Brooklyn and Jersey City, is taking on a bigger task: Rebooting Petworth\u2019s Upshur Street Books as Loyalty. \u201cCommunity-building through bookselling is my passion,\u201d she says. \u201cI want Loyalty to look more like Petworth. I want there to be a really diverse selection of books, but reflect the full scope of what people in Petworth love.\u201d As she did in Silver Spring, she expects to stock plenty of nonbook items. On Saturdays, Depp explains, a lot of the sales are what she calls \u201cshower gifts\u201d: board books for kids, plus cards, knickknacks and a bag to put everything in. \u201cI\u2019m not competing with Amazon,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m competing with people\u2019s time.\u201d Where Upshur Street struggled to find its voice, she says, she thinks that Loyalty can become a neighborhood destination. There will be more children\u2019s events, author appearances and book clubs, such as one looking at intersectional romance and one called \u201cPages Against the Patriarchy.\u201d She plans on partnerships with the neighboring restaurant Petworth Citizen. The weekly Literary Cocktails series, which finds veteran bartender Chantal Tseng creating a menu of drinks inspired by a new or classic book, might expand to feature Tseng\u2019s selection from the bookstore in the week leading up to the tasting, and Depp is also thinking about a literary-themed brunch, too. For those mourning Loyalty\u2019s departure from Silver Spring, Depp says she\u2019s still working on a permanent space downtown with a full bar or cafe. \u201cWe have an eye on a couple of spaces, but it\u2019s a struggle.\u201d 827 Upshur St. NW.  After a decade of operating Mahogany Books as an online bookstore selling titles \u201cfor, by, or about people of the African diaspora,\u201d Derrick Young and Ramunda Lark Young opened a shop inside the Anacostia Arts Center in November 2017. The first bookstore east of the Anacostia River to open in more than two decades, it\u2019s heavily stocked with materials targeted at children, which is important in a neighborhood considered a book desert. Mahogany also gives back, with an annual book drive called Books for the Block. Young readers aren\u2019t the only ones who benefit: Mahogany features a schedule of author events and networking socials. In October, the store launched a monthly book club with the popular blog Very Smart Brothas, which is part of TheRoot.com. They\u2019ll tackle Nafissa Thompson-Spires\u2019s engrossing short-story collection \u201cHeads of the Colored People\u201d on March 1. 1231 Good Hope Rd. SE.  Old Fox is a quirky bookstore. Visitors open a squeaky door and negotiate creaking floorboards before making it to a front table where the Teddy Roosevelt-inspired \u201cPerilous Adventures of the Cowboy King\u201d sits near Hanif Abdurraqib\u2019s love letter to A Tribe Called Quest, \u201cGo Ahead in the Rain.\u201d But Old Fox, which takes its name from a sobriquet for George Washington, isn\u2019t the average bookstore: Owner Jinny Amundson estimates that 35 percent of the store\u2019s sales are new books, while the rest are vintage and used books. Because it\u2019s on a historic street between the Maryland State House and the U.S. Naval Academy, books on American history and maritime topics do well, though there\u2019s a well-stocked philosophy section to cater to the students from nearby St. John\u2019s College. \u201cThe Johnnies think this is their bookstore, and the Mids think that this is their bookstore,\u201d Amundson says, laughing. Old Fox fills two floors of a Colonial-era building, connected by a spiral staircase. It\u2019s also a shrine for Harry Potter fans: Note the \u201csigned\u201d photo of Gilderoy Lockhart in the bathroom, and see if you can find the horcruxes hidden throughout. In the rear is Brown Mustache Coffee, where book browsers can collect a flat white or cup of tea, and then settle into a leather armchair in front of a brick fireplace. (Fez, the shop\u2019s chonky resident Bernese mountain dog, may be sleeping nearby.) The long communal table is used for teleworking during the day and hosts book clubs in the evenings. \u201cEvery town deserves a spot like ours,\u201d Amundson says, and it\u2019s hard to disagree. 35 Maryland Ave., Annapolis.  Ally Kirkpatrick never thought she\u2019d own a bookstore, even though, she explains, \u201cI\u2019m one of those people who\u2019ve always been obsessed with independent bookstores.\u201d In November, Old Town Books opened in a cozy, light-filled space near the Torpedo Factory, and it\u2019s technically a pop-up, on a short-term lease while Kirkpatrick hunts for a permanent location. (She says she\u2019s \u201c90 percent sure\u201d she\u2019s found another space nearby, which she hopes to open in May.) Old Town Books stocks many of the general-interest titles that appear on bestseller lists, though Kirkpatrick hopes customers stumble across titles they didn\u2019t know they needed. \u201cI\u2019ve always been surprised by what I found in small indie bookstores. They\u2019re so different from what I would usually read.\u201d Regardless of the location, Kirkpatrick has big plans for Old Town Books, including a literary festival in August. Old Town Books continues to host book clubs, concerts and talks. Kirkpatrick is also scheduling events that are \u201cmore than just coming and doing a reading,\u201d such as a series called Read Write Now, which includes a discussion with an author about writing, group writing prompts and a Q&A; session. Abby Maslin, who turned a series of blog posts about her husband\u2019s traumatic brain injury into a just-released memoir, is the guest on March 30. 104 S. Union St., Alexandria.  Independent booksellers know that authenticity will help them stand out in a crowded field. At One More Page, an eight-year-old bookstore in East Falls Church, \u201cWe\u2019re not shy about expressing our personalities,\u201d says store book buyer Lelia Nebeker. This comes through in a variety of ways: its Boozy Booksellers YouTube series, which finds Nebeker and store events coordinator Rebecca Speas acting silly and enjoying drinks while chatting with authors on camera; its in-store book recommendations, such as Lyndsay Faye\u2019s \u201cJane Steele,\u201d which reimagines Jane Eyre as a serial killer (\u201cmurder and feminism \u2014 that covers us,\u201d Nebeker says, laughing); and its book clubs, including the Romance Roundtables, which pair wine tastings and Q&As; with contemporary romance authors. \u201cWe want to make romance seem a little more accessible, and destigmatize it from being a guilty pleasure.\u201d (The next roundtable is March 1.) One More Page is also supporting the next generation of readers: It\u2019s a co-founder and sponsor of the NoVa Teen Book Festival, a six-year-old literary festival focused on young adult literature. Last year saw 9,000 readers show up at Washington-Lee High School to hear 40 authors speak on panels and participate in breakout discussions. This year\u2019s free festival will be at George Marshall High School on March 30. 2200 N. Westmoreland St., Arlington. Jake Cumsky-Whitlock and Scott Abel met while working at Kramerbooks, where Abel was the general manager and Cumsky-Whitlock was the store\u2019s head buyer. They\u2019ve gone out on their own with the introduction of Solid State, an open and welcoming shop that sits alongside Whole Foods on the vibrant H Street NE corridor. Books are not necessarily arranged by topic \u2014 don\u2019t be surprised to see \u201cThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck\u201d next to Ron Chernow\u2019s biography of Ulysses S. Grant or the locally focused \u201cChocolate City\u201d on display tables \u2014 but that only encourages shoppers to spend more time browsing. Prime seats in the front windows or at long tables encourage lingering with a cup of coffee or a craft beer. (Taking a cue from Kramerbooks, happy hour runs from 4 to 7 p.m. on weekdays.) Book clubs cover the spectrum: foreign policy, poetry, works related to Rorschach Theater\u2019s current season, and Music Graphic Novels, which adds audio and video clips to the mix. 600 H St. NE.  No recommendation algorithm can beat the booksellers at Alexandria\u2019s venerable Hooray for Books. Owner Ellen Klein opened the shop in 2008 and saw it double in size in 2015. Now, \u201cbecause we\u2019re 11 years old, we\u2019ve seen children grow up from being in strollers to being taller than I am,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know their names \u2014 we can say, \u2018Hey, Patrick, here\u2019s a great book for you!\u2019 They trust us, and we make them feel vested.\u201d Years ago, Klein started the Youth Advisory Council, which provides advance copies of books to students from elementary-school-age through high school. They read and serve as a focus group, Klein says: \u201cThey tell us, \u2018Buy a lot of this one,\u2019 or \u2018Don\u2019t buy this, no one\u2019s going to like it.\u2019\u2009\u201d Reviews are published in the store\u2019s newsletter. Hooray for Books has popular weekday and weekend story times, which bring in 20 to 30 kids and give parents a chance to socialize, as well as author events that can draw hundreds of fans. The expansion allowed Klein to expand a section of the store with new bestsellers and history books, but the store\u2019s focus remains on children. 1555 King St. Alexandria. A fixture in Dupont Circle for more than four decades, Kramerbooks remains one of the most important bookstores for both sides of Washington: The political cognoscenti lined up here for the midnight release of Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire and Fury\u201d and other topical tell-alls \u2014 \u201cHarry Potter for adults,\u201d observed one late-night customer \u2014 while generations of Washingtonians have spent first or second dates browsing the shelves and getting to know each other over drinks and snacks at the in-house cafe. Under new owner Steven Salis, the co-founder of &pizza;, Kramerbooks expanded into a neighboring storefront in 2018. 1517 Connecticut Ave. NW.  As it approaches 35 years in business, Politics and Prose has become a Washington landmark. Over that time,the store has organized a staggering number of readings, from local authors with a few dozen fans on upper Connecticut Avenue to Kamala D. Harris or Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s at a sold-out Lisner Auditorium. (J.K. Rowling signed books back in 1999.) Twenty-two book clubs are sponsored by P&P;, with themes including graphic novels, lesbian writers, travelogues and horror. Its basement cafe, the Den, is a gathering place with coffee, pastries and wine. Not content to rest on these laurels, however, Politics and Prose opened two branches, at the Wharf and Union Market, in the fall of 2017, looking beyond leafy Northwest to growing retail areas. \u201cWe were motivated by the shifting of the center of gravity from Northwest to Northeast and Southwest D.C.,\u201d co-owner Bradley Graham says. \u201cThere\u2019s housing stock being renovated, new buildings going up and people with disposable income going in.\u201d Three locations: 5015 Connecticut Ave. NW; 70 District Sq. SW; 1270 Fifth St. NE.  Located across the street from Howard University, Sankofa was opened by husband-and-wife filmmakers Haile and Shirikiana Gerima in 1997 to showcase books and films from Africans and African Americans. It\u2019s particularly strong in biography, history and fiction, and the children\u2019s section is packed with inspirational board books and coloring books. More than just a place to read, Sankofa sponsors weekly jazz performances, and the cafe offers panini, wraps and salads named after filmmakers. 2714 Georgia Ave. NW. ","30":"Even after the Lion Air crash of its state-of-the-art Max 8 in October, Boeing was predicting another banner year in 2019. Orders of its 737 Max 8 aircraft were up. It had notched three major Pentagon contracts. And its stock was flying sky high. But now, after another of the aviation giant\u2019s jets crashed, this time in Ethiopia, killing all 157 people on board, it\u2019s facing renewed questions about its safety and reliability as investors knocked back its share price more than 12 percent in early trading Monday. Boeing, which last year carried the Dow Jones industrial average to record highs, dragged it down on Monday morning, as the blue-chip measure opened in the red. China, Indonesia and Ethiopia have grounded the 737 Max 8, which was involved in both crashes, and other carriers have signaled they may follow suit. In a statement Monday, Boeing said no new safety guidance is planned as of now: \" The investigation is in its early stages, but at this point, based on the information available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance.\" The Chicago-based U.S. aerospace giant, with more than $100 billion in revenue and 153,000 employees, is one of the most heavily weighted of the Dow\u2019s 30 components. It has been one of the drivers of the 10-year-old bull market; its stock had been up more than 30 percent, year to date, as of Friday\u2019s close. The \"decline is weighing heavily on the Dow because the stock has much more to surrender than other Dow components,\u201d said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index showed slight gains in early trading Monday. Europe and Asia markets were also up, despite growing concerns over global growth spurred by a disappointing U.S. jobs report on Friday. The crash comes as the aerospace giant has been having a stellar year. Its commercial business has been surging. It pulled in those three major military contracts worth more than $18 billion to build training jets, replacement helicopters and drones that can refuel fighter jets in midair. Boeing is also building the next Air Force One, a spacecraft to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station and a monster rocket that NASA says will again take them to the moon. In 2016, it celebrated its 100-year anniversary, a legacy that marches in lockstep with the history of American aviation, from dawn of commercial air travel in the years following the Wright brothers to the bombers that helped to allies win World War II, to the F-18 Hornets and 747s in use today. But now that investigators are probing two crashes that have killed a total of 346 people, the company is facing a crisis involving its core business and a threat to the reputation it has built up after decades. One of Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg\u2019s goals for the company has been to better integrate its three major business units\u2014commercial jets, defense and space\u2014under a strategy he has called \u201cOne Boeing.\u201d Its commercial airliner business, however, has long been the driver, and international orders for Boeing\u2019s commercial jets continued to climb, even after the crash in October. With a backlog of 5,900 airplane orders, valued at $412 billion, it predicted steady growth in 2019. It is not clear what caused Sunday\u2019s crash of Ethio\u00adpian Airlines Flight 302 six minutes after takeoff. on Sunday. Data show the plane ascending, then descending. It then began another ascent, this time while accelerating at faster-than-usual takeoff speeds. The pilot asked to return to Addis Ababa because he was experiencing difficulties, authorities said. In October, an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, Indonesia, killing all 189 passengers and crew members. Investigators blamed a faulty sensor and automatic feature for pointing its nose down while pilots struggled to lift the plane up. Though the investigation is still in the early stages, the similarities between the two crashes have prompted carriers around the world to take added precautions. China\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration said it asked domestic carriers to temporarily ground all 737 Max 8 jets, potentially affecting hundreds of flights. Ethi\u00ado\u00adpian Airlines said its fleet would be grounded as a precaution, as did carriers in Indonesia and India. Boeing said it was working with investigators in Ethiopia to understand the cause of the crash. The 737 Max 8 has been an important profit driver for Boeing since it was introduced in 2017. It is crucial to Boeing\u2019s broader international ambitions as it competes with Airbus, its European rival in the commercial airline business. Boeing has delivered 354 of the jets globally and has 2,912 on order, according to market estimates maintained by Boyd Group International. The jet that crashed Sunday was one of five 737 Max 8 planes operated by Ethiopian Airlines, which has 25 more on order. In the United States, Southwest Airlines and American Airlines have 59 between their two fleets, with 304 on order. Southwest said it has been in touch with Boeing and plans to follow the investigation. It had not made any changes to its operations or inspection protocol as of Sunday, the airline said. American Airlines said it was monitoring the investigation but remained confident in the safety of its aircraft. While Boeing\u2019s commercial business has long driven the company\u2019s revenues and stock price, it has also focused on transforming its defense business under the leadership of Leanne Caret, who was brought in to lead the division in 2016. She was brought in after a Boeing and Lockheed Martin team had lost a high-stakes contract to Northrop Grumman to build a new stealth bomber for the Pentagon. But since then, the company has had some notable successes, such as the Pentagon contract wins, which came over rivals such as Lockheed Martin. The company was criticized as bidding too low in an effort to unseat competitors, but executives said in late October that those three combined opportunities would eventually rake in up to $60 billion over the next several decades. \u201cThink of these as investments that enable a production run that begins in the early 2020s and will extend literally for decades,\u201d Muilenburg, Boeing\u2019s CEO, told investors at the time.","31":"But his voters will love it! This phrase has become a stock joke among liberals, lampooning President Trump\u2019s confidence that his voters will thrill to whatever populist theatrics he feeds them \u2014 no matter how ugly, authoritarian or racist \u2014 even as he has completely sold out on the real populism they supposedly elected him to fulfill. As Trump\u2019s attacks on the deceased John McCain continue, Trump\u2019s allies are now taking that stock joke to a new, self-parodic low \u2014 and in the process, unintentionally revealing what a monstrous scam this presidency really is. Their new argument is that Trump\u2019s rants against McCain will thrill his voters, but more to the point, that these attacks constitute, in an important way, the fulfillment of the promise of his campaign. Yes, this is their actual argument. The Post reports that Trump allies view McCain as a \u201cuseful foil\u201d in the eyes of Trump voters. McCain has been dead for nearly seven months, so this itself seems to betray that Trumpworld has a rather dim view of those voters. But it\u2019s why this is the case that\u2019s of interest here. Trump allies believe McCain symbolizes \u201ceverything his core voters have come to loathe\u201d about \u201cthe GOP\u2019s political elite,\u201d including its support for the Russia probe and its \u201copposition to Trump\u2019s nativist agenda.\u201d Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel (R) defends Trump\u2019s attacks by claiming his voters see McCain as the \u201cembodiment\u201d of the sort of \u201clifetime career politician\u201d who left them feeling \u201cpowerless and voiceless for many years,\u201d until Trump arrived. GOP consultant Mike Shields claims Trump\u2019s attacks on McCain tap his voters\u2019 frustration with \u201cpoliticians that lie to them\u201d and \u201caren\u2019t real,\u201d whereas these attacks show Trump is \u201creal.\u201d Trump\u2019s outsider authenticity turns out to be a willingness to slime a dead man who can\u2019t defend himself. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) defends Trump\u2019s rage at McCain as \u201creasonable,\u201d because McCain wanted to \u201cstick it to the president\u201d when he voted against repealing Obamacare in 2017. And in a new interview with Fox News, Trump himself makes similar claims. He rips into McCain as \u201chorrible\u201d for voting against Obamacare repeal, adding: \u201cWe would have had great health care.\u201d And he slams McCain for turning over to the FBI the \u201cSteele dossier,\u201d which he claims was \u201cpaid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.\u201d Thus, the narrative Trumpworld is spinning is that, in attacking McCain, Trump is standing up for his voters, by going after a symbol of the GOP elites he campaigned against and of the deep-state forces working against the will of those voters, and those who blocked him from delivering on his health-care promises. My intention here is not to defend or exalt McCain, but rather to look at what all this says about what a con this whole presidency really is. Nothing but scams Trump did not merely promise to repeal Obamacare. He also vowed to replace it with \u201cinsurance for everybody.\u201d He explicitly campaigned on the idea that his desire to give people health care made him different from GOP elites. But he sold out on this promise, by embracing the actual goal of GOP elites: rolling back Obamacare\u2019s coverage and protections for millions without meaningfully replacing them. Because this was so unpopular, Republicans employed extraordinary partisan tactics and secrecy to try to push it through. This procedural abuse is what McCain voted against. He blocked Trump\u2019s efforts to conspire with GOP elites to sell out on his promise to his voters. That\u2019s of a piece with Trump\u2019s broader selling-out of his economic populism. After getting elected by promising to drain the swamp of elite corruption and take on the plutocrats who rig our political economy to enrich themselves, he gave those elites a deregulation spree that further rigged the economy in their favor, and a corporate tax cut that lavished enormous benefits on top earners. (As it happens, this is an area where Trump and McCain broadly agree.) All that\u2019s left of Trump\u2019s vow to take on elites and to give health care to everybody is his attacks on one member of the elite who is dead. This is what honoring his promise to voters has been reduced to? Absurd lies designed to evade accountability Trump\u2019s attacks on McCain over the Steele dossier are similarly absurd \u2014 and revealing. The implication is that McCain conspired against Trump\u2019s election and then joined the deep-state coup to reverse it. But the idea that Clinton is behind the dossier is complete nonsense, McCain didn\u2019t get the dossier until after the election, and the dossier isn\u2019t even what initiated the Russia investigation in the first place. McCain represented a small but influential bloc in the GOP that has forcefully stood up for the rule of law by defending the investigation and law enforcement against Trump\u2019s attacks on them. (This is true even if you disagree with the anti-Russia views that partly drove McCain\u2019s stance.) In targeting McCain over this, Trump is just reprising the lies and degradation of our institutions that are designed to help him evade accountability for his own elite corruption, the true dimensions of which we are only beginning to learn about from the investigation and its spinoffs. This is honoring his promise to voters? As for the idea that in attacking McCain, Trump is targeting GOP elites who oppose his nativism, it\u2019s true that McCain has called out Trump\u2019s xenophobic ethno-nationalism. Here his attacks on McCain do highlight an area where Trump really has tried to fulfill his promises. But his anti-immigrant hate agenda is pretty much all that\u2019s left of Trump\u2019s supposed economic nationalism. This is supposed to thrill his voters? What does that say about them? In all these ways, the very idea that attacks on McCain fulfill his promise to his voters embodies the multifaceted scam festering at the core of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 dragged to absolute rock bottom.

A Marine band played before an A-list audience that included the speaker of the House of Representatives, the chief justice of the United States and titans of the newspaper industry. Al Neuharth, the brash USA Today founder whose grand vision was coming to fruition, gushed about \u201cthis glamorous glass house\u201d that had sprouted on land bought at the highest price ever for a chunk of real estate in the city\u2019s history. The new museum\u2019s chief executive, Charles Overby, declared that they were \u201claying down a marker right here on Pennsylvania Avenue that the First Amendment is the cornerstone of our democracy.\u201d It was a dazzling start that gave no hint of the dizzying fall to come. \u201cEveryone was so mesmerized,\u201d recalled University of Maryland journalism professor Edward Alwood. \u201cWe thought .\u2009.\u2009. this thing can\u2019t lose.\u201d Just 10 years later, the Newseum is shrinking into an uncertain future, the distress sale of its building to Johns Hopkins University marking the end of a troubled tenure that has become a cautionary tale of bloated budgets and unrealized ambition. The museum has been weighted down by crushing debt and beset by management upheaval, and its downfall has long been foretold, but it is still a gut punch to an industry labeled the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d by President Trump and struggling with digital-era financial troubles galore. Over the next year \u2014 before it closes to the public in January 2020 \u2014 the museum will welcome visitors into its light-splashed atrium on their way to see artifacts as heartbreaking as a charred remnant of the New York tower that terrorists toppled on Sept. 11, 2001, and as inspiring as its popular gallery of Pulitzer-winning photographs. Even as visitors walk past those sights, planning will be underway to scatter the collection into a storage facility and, in some cases, to return items to lenders. \u201cWe plan to continue the Newseum\u2019s crucial work of increasing public understanding of the importance of a free press and the First Amendment for decades to come \u2014 through digital outreach, traveling exhibits, and web-based programs in schools around the world, as well as hopefully in a new physical home in the area,\u201d Maeve Gaynor Scott, the Newseum\u2019s director of collections, said in an email last week to individuals and institutions that have lent pieces to the museum. Neuharth\u2019s daughter, Jan Neuharth, who helms the Freedom Forum, the museum\u2019s primary benefactor, has said a new location in the city will be found after the $372.5 million sale to Hopkins. But in an interview with The Washington Post last year as the depth of the museum\u2019s financial woes were deepening, Neuharth mused aloud about myriad possibilities, including a home in some digital \u201ccloud.\u201d \u201cThe short answer,\u201d she said then, \u201cis we don\u2019t know what it will look like.\u201d The Newseum originally opened in 1997 in Rosslyn in a building with a geodesic dome as its only recognizable feature. About 400,000 visitors a year enjoyed free entry to its interactive exhibitions, innovative video displays and a memorial to fallen journalists. Good reviews and enthusiastic crowds prompted Al Neuharth to dream bigger, and in the coming years, he was imagining a splashier space across the Potomac River. The Freedom Forum had a reputation for excess, so it wasn\u2019t a shock that it plunked down $100\u00a0million for a parcel on Pennsylvania Avenue with a prime view of the Capitol \u2014 a record-setting sale. To pull off the real estate deal, the foundation had to make a choice: pay for the building in Washington or continue to maintain its network of overseas offices, which supported democratic ideals. \u201cWe chose Washington,\u201d Overby told the American Journalism Review in 2001. Overby has not responded to interview requests. Eliminating the overseas offices wasn\u2019t enough. The next year, the foundation axed its Freedom Forum Fellows program, which helped working journalists get academic credentials to teach at universities. It shuttered its old location in Rosslyn, as well. With its plans fixed on swanky new digs in Washington, the foundation also needed piles of cash. It took out $350\u00a0million in loans to pay for construction. The risks were acceptable, according to executives involved, because their coffers were fat. The Freedom Forum\u2019s assets topped $1.1\u00a0billion in the late 1990s, when planning for the new building began. Marrying vision and execution proved problematic. Costs soared. Delays mounted. By the time the Newseum was ready to open its doors, the project was three years behind schedule, and its price tag would eventually swell to $477\u00a0million. \u201cI thought this day would never come,\u201d Overby said at the dedication ceremony for the steel-and-glass building \u2014 with the First Amendment etched in stone and facing Pennsylvania Avenue. The museum\u2019s leaders brimmed with confidence. They looked at the millions who visited the Smithsonian\u2019s Air and Space and Natural History museums \u2014 which had average annual attendance of 7.4\u00a0million and 5.3\u00a0million in the early 2000s \u2014 and figured they could reasonably expect to draw 1\u00a0million a year. High-tech exhibits, a conference space and a restaurant from famous chef Wolfgang Puck would serve as the lure. But there was a difference between their museum and the popular, admission-free Smithsonians: They would charge an entrance fee \u2014 one of the highest in city. It now stands at $25 a person. They never met their goal. In 2017, the museum\u2019s best attendance year, it fell short with 855,000 visitors. And the money wasn\u2019t coming in, either. From 2008-2017, admission revenue never broke $10\u00a0million, meaning the average ticket was steeply discounted to less than $10. During the same 10-year span, the Newseum\u2019s rental and catering revenue kept the organization afloat, averaging $15.2\u00a0million \u2014 more than double the amount generated by admissions. Meanwhile, the museum cut expenses. There have been five rounds of staff cuts in the past 10\u00a0years, the first in 2009 and the most recent in 2017, when it laid off 10\u00a0percent of its staff. All the while, the Freedom Forum poured money into the struggling operation, handing over an average annual subsidy of $29\u00a0million, according to tax filings. Even with that yearly injection of cash, the Newseum has had deficits every year. While operating in the red, the Newseum kept paying big salaries to upper management, including $1.2\u00a0million to chief executive James C. Duff in 2014. His successor, Jeffrey Herbst, pocketed $632,441 in 2016. Even so, the museum has had five chief executives since 2014. Jan Neuharth, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has blamed the economy for the institution\u2019s financial problems. The Great Recession hit just months before Newseum 2.0 opened in Washington, cutting into its admissions and donations. By 2013, the Freedom Forum\u2019s $1.1\u00a0billion endowment had shriveled to about $340\u00a0million, tax records show. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re bad about money,\u201d Jan Neuharth said when pressed about the financial problems in an interview last year. \u201cWe have thoughtfully and thoroughly addressed a situation that happened. I don\u2019t think anybody saw \u201908 coming.\u201d When the economy rebounded after the stock market convulsions, the Newseum failed to bounce back. The stock market roared to record highs, but the museum couldn\u2019t manage to capi\u00adtal\u00adize by attracting some of that newly created wealth. The news industry was contracting and consolidating, leaving the museum with fewer doors to knock on and smaller grants from its early supporters. Big fundraising campaigns were promised but never materialized. More than $300\u00a0million in loans became the organization\u2019s albatross, and donors traditionally have little enthusiasm for making gifts to retire debt. One of the hallmarks of the original Newseum was its \u00adforward-leaning embrace of technology. At its new location, however, it struggled to reflect dramatic changes in the media industry. It opened a year after the iPhone hit the market. But its galleries displayed another era\u2019s idea of advanced news technology, such as satellite trucks and studios with green screens, at a time when the most innovative news organizations were beginning to fling themselves into the digital era. \u201cI don\u2019t think we all agree, as we did in the past, about what \u2018news\u2019 means,\u201d said Alwood, the Maryland professor. \u201cThe Newseum is trying to portray an industry that is ill-defined, therefore the Newseum is ill-defined.\u201d Critics groused about exhibits that focused on pop culture, including an early show on Elvis Presley and more recent ones on rock music and presidential dogs, rather than tackling such issues as the changing media and consumer habits. The advent of the Trump era created a minefield for an institution that increasingly seemed unsure of its footing. Instead of using its authority to push back on Trump\u2019s claims that journalists are the enemies of the people and that the media traffics in \u201cfake news,\u201d the Newseum shop sold red \u201cMake America Great Hats\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d T-shirts. It pulled them last summer, after a firestorm of criticism. Still, there was something that visitors \u2014 especially journalists \u2014 found endearing about the place. As its financial troubles spiked to crisis levels, many journalists turned to social media to share their despair. They thought it was something worth saving, even after a decade of frustration. In August, Douglas Cumming, a journalism professor at Washington and Lee University who had been a Freedom Forum fellow, proposed a panel on redesigning the Newseum. \u201cSurely the history of journalism and the inspiration of the First Amendment deserve a museum for the masses,\u201d according to his proposal. \u201cIt may be too late or irrelevant for saving the Newseum, but what ideas might be generated for a sustainable business model.\u201d He asked Newseum officials to participate. They turned him down. Cumming is one of many professors who rely on the museum. \u201cWe used to take classes there, busloads of kids,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good. The civil rights exhibit, the history section, with primary sources. They are a good resource for journalism education. Maybe they can come up with something new that doesn\u2019t have to do with a dazzling building in the middle of Washington.\u201d Erika Pribanic-Smith, a professor at the University of Texas at Arlington, wants the Newseum to expand its digital content to better serve a society gripped by partisan bickering and suspicious of media bias. \u201cWe need journalism education now more than ever,\u201d she said, noting that she uses the museum\u2019s digital archives and \u201cToday\u2019s Front Pages\u201d frequently. \u201cAnything that they can do, such as traveling exhibitions, is fantastic. I think the building was a wonderful beacon, a wonderful monument to journalism. But the more they can do with their digital space, to get the word out there, that\u2019s so much more accessible.\u201d Such retrenchments are rare, and difficult. In 2011, the American Folk Art Museum in New York was forced to sell its 10-year-old showcase space next to the Museum of Modern Art because it defaulted on construction loans. It returned to its smaller building at Lincoln Square. Financial problems forced the National Academy of Design in New York to sell two of its three buildings, including one on Fifth Avenue. Its school and museum are \u201con hiatus.\u201d The Newseum\u2019s next chapter is less certain. \u201cThey have to suck up the loss,\u201d Andrew Taylor, an arts management professor at American University, said of the sale. \u201cIt feels like a failure, and it\u2019s disappointing. But if they care about the mission, they need to regroup.\u201d Correction: An earlier version of the story incorrectly said that before the Newseum moved to the District it was above the Rosslyn Metro station.","33":"Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. filed for voluntary bankruptcy protection Tuesday as it braces for the impact of billions of dollars in liability claims for some of California\u2019s deadliest wildfires. The filing made PG&E a massive victim of climate change, unable to deal with years of drought that made dry forests kindling for damaged transmission lines. While other factors also pushed the company into bankruptcy, the utility\u2019s fate served as a wake up call to other companies potentially vulnerable to climate change. The biggest utility company in the country, PG&E was recently cleared of blame in the destructive Tubbs Fire, which blazed through Santa Rosa in fall 2017. But the company is still under scrutiny for its role in the Camp Fire, the worst wildfire in state history, which razed the small town of Paradise in November and killed 86 people. Mired in lawsuits, PG&E now has more than $50 billion in liabilities, according to bankruptcy court filings. It listed its assets at a little more than $71 billion. \u201cThroughout this process, we are fully committed to enhancing our wildfire safety efforts, as well as helping restoration and rebuilding efforts across the communities impacted by the devastating Northern California wildfires,\u201d John Simon, PG&E\u2019s interim chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cThrough this process, we will prioritize what matters most to our customers and the communities we serve \u2014 safety and reliability. We believe that this process will make sure that we have sufficient liquidity to serve our customers and support our operations and obligations.\" PG&E\u2019s bankruptcy announcement has garnered criticism from investors, government officials and the public, who fear that the company\u2019s actions will send utility rates skyrocketing and leave wildfire victims without an avenue for recompense. The bankruptcy filing immediately puts a halt to the wildfire lawsuits and consolidates them in bankruptcy court, where legal experts say victims are likely to receive less money. Wildfire victims have little chance of getting punitive damages or taking their claims to a jury in a bankruptcy proceeding. Instead, they will have to tussle with PG&E\u2019s creditors, including bondholders, for a payout from the company. \u201cThe PG&E bankruptcy, while expected, has far-ranging implications beyond just California ratepayers,\u201d said John Kilduff of Again Capital. \u201cCalifornia had led the way, opening up its electricity and natural gas market, and PG&E was a dominant force. The result were lower prices for consumers, and that model is now threatened. Insurance companies and those who did not have insurance on their homes will left holding the bag, as PG&E will escape a great deal of financial liability. \u201c The San Francisco-based company, which provides power to about 16 million people in northern and central California, is also asking the court to approve $5.5 billion in debtor-in-possession financing to fuel its operations while it undergoes bankruptcy proceedings. When it announced its intent to file bankruptcy, the company fenced off the entrance to its headquarters, bracing for public protests. On the morning of Nov. 8, PG&E employees saw smoke near a utility tower that had abruptly lost power. Within 15 minutes, the first flames of the Camp Fire began roaring through the Sierra foothills. The company reported the overlap between the tower outage and the start of the fire to state regulators, who have yet to decide whether PG&E is to blame for the blaze. Only California and Alabama hold utilities \u201cstrictly liable\u201d for fires started by their equipment. The liability applies even if the company\u2019s equipment was working correctly and met safety requirements at the time of an incident, a high standard that last summer PG&E officials lobbied the state legislature to lower. Company executives said at the time that \u201cyesterday\u2019s laws will not keep up with tomorrow\u2019s risks.\u201d But many analysts also blamed PG&E for a lax corporate culture. \u201cCalifornia needs radical changes from its largest utility. Frequent disasters (including wildfires and the deadly San Bruno pipeline explosion in 2010) continue to plague PG&E, and leadership changes have been slow to overhaul the company\u2019s culture of safety,\u201d Height Analytics, an investment advisory service, said in a note Tuesday morning. In the past month, the chief executive, three other senior executives and a member of the board of directors have resigned. Utilities rarely go bankrupt, though a major subsidiary of PG&E filed for bankruptcy in 2001. The company then blamed government officials and regulators for California\u2019s energy crisis, part of the fallout from the scandal involving Enron. BlueMountain Capital Management, a key PG&E investor that was outspoken against the company\u2019s earlier steps toward bankruptcy protection, called for the removal of PG&E\u2019s current board of directors Tuesday in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s filing is the latest example of how the Board continues to fail the Company, wildfire victims, customers, employees, creditors, shareholders and the people of California,\u201d the asset management firm said. \u201cWe urge all stakeholders to support change at PG&E and will be proposing a \u201cNew Slate\u201d of highly-qualified and impartial directors.\u201d The bankrupt utility also faces claims from suppliers of renewable energy. Those payments cost PG&E $2.2 billion a year. Many of those contracts were made at above market prices to help the utility fulfill aggressive renewable energy requirements set by the state, and it is possible that PG&E will seek to renegotiate those contracts at lower prices. One of the biggest firms selling renewable energy to PG&E, NextEra, has appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which indicated that it might try to assert jurisdiction. The company said it intends to pay suppliers in full for goods and services provided after the bankruptcy date. It has asked the court to authorize payment of employee wages, health-care and other benefits. It also asked for authorization to continue customer programs, including low-income support, energy efficiency and other programs encouraging clean energy measures, according to a news release. PG&E\u2019s stock jumped more than 17 percent in morning trading following the announcement. Thomas Heath and Scott Wilson contributed to this report.","34":"The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.9 percent pace last year, the Commerce Department reported Thursday, a strong rate but just shy of President Trump\u2019s goal of 3 percent. Last year\u2019s growth marked the fastest gain for the economy since 2015, according to official government data. The economy received a big boost from the largest corporate tax cut in U.S. history that went into effect last year, as well as additional government spending on military and domestic programs. But that stimulus is widely expected to wear off later this year, causing growth to slow. Growth in the final quarter of last year was 2.6 percent, above forecasts but below the 3.4 percent pace in the third quarter and 4.2 percent pace in the second quarter. Consumer and business spending were both strong, but Americans bought a little less than they did earlier in the year. \u201cLast year was likely the best year of this business cycle,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. \u201cWe stimulated the heck out of the economy last year and that stimulus will fade this year.\u201d Trump and his top officials have repeatedly said they can achieve at least 3 percent annual growth for the next decade with the president even claiming it \u201ccould go to 4, 5, and maybe even 6 percent\" as Republicans put the final touches on the tax cut bill in late 2017. The White House says it achieved its goal because the growth rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 is 3.1 percent above the fourth quarter of the prior year. The Commerce Department calculation compares the average growth for 2018 to the average growth in 2017.  \u201cOur policies are working,\u201d said Kevin Hassett, head of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors. \u201cWe said there would be a capital spending boom and we would get 3.1 percent growth. That is what happened.\" There\u2019s heavy debate among economists about which measure is preferable. Using the White House\u2019s preferred method means last year was the strongest for economic growth since before the recession. Hassett said the White House remains \u201cconfident\u201d that \u201c2019 will be another 3 percent year.\u201d  The vast majority of economists predict growth will be lower this year. The Federal Reserve is currently predicting 2.3 percent growth for 2019. Fed vice chair Richard Clarida said Thursday morning that he is likely to lower his forecast as headwinds overseas in Europe and China could drag down growth at home. \u201cWhile my baseline outlook for growth, employment, and inflation is a positive one, a number of crosscurrents that are buffeting the economy bear careful scrutiny,\u201d Clarida said, noting that some recent economic data has been disappointing.  The Commerce Department had to delay this report because of the partial government shutdown that furloughed many employees who work on key economic data collection and calculation.  Consumer spending continues to power the economy with Americans opening their wallets on a wide range of purchases. Business investment also picked up in the final quarter last year, a sign that companies are still hiring and investing because they do not foresee a recession on the horizon. There were especially strong gains in intellectual property and equipment purchases, but spending on residential homes declined 3.5 percent. The home building industry has continued to struggle with rising interest rates dissuading buyers and higher costs for some materials because of Trump\u2019s tariffs. \u201cThe consumer is trending lower, though consumption is still strong. My main concern is housing investment which fell for the fourth consecutive quarter,\" said Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG. \"If this continues into 2019, it will be a worrying signal for future growth. \" \u200bTrade was a drag on growth at the end of last year as imports heavily exceeded exports, meaning Americans brought more foreign products than they sold. There was a rush earlier in the year to sell U.S. soybeans and other products to China before Trump\u2019s tariffs went into effect, but that trend has now reversed. Trump and many top aides have sounded optimistic that there will soon be an agreement with China to end the trade dispute. Stocks have rallied and are back near an all-time high reached in late September as trade news has improved and the Fed announced a pause in interest rate increases.  Hassett predicted economists will likely need to revise their forecasts higher for this year once trade negotiations with China wrap up. But many economists remain more cautious, although they don\u2019t see an imminent recession. Much will depend on whether American consumers continue to spend and whether businesses keep investing in new technology and factories.  \u201cAs we look ahead to 2019, there are good reasons to expect growth not to be as strong, but I don\u2019t anticipate growth collapsing,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.

The video shows a man on top of an awning, dancing above a crowd. He touches his anus and then another man urinates on him. The backlash was swift against Bolsonaro, who has enjoyed considerable support from the country\u2019s right wing, including evangelicals. Several users reported Bolsonaro to Twitter, which prohibits the publication of videos depicting sexual acts. Some users went so far as to demand that the president be impeached for violating a Brazilian law prohibiting officials from \u201cacting in a way that is incompatible with the dignity, honor, and decorum of the office.\u201d The president didn\u2019t stop there. \u201cWhat is a golden shower?\u201d he posted the next morning, referencing the act of urinating on another person. On Wednesday morning, #goldenshowerpresident and #impeachbolsonaro were trending on Twitter. Once a fringe, right-wing politician, Bolsonaro was propelled to office last year through a social-media-heavy campaign that tapped into voter frustration with establishment politicians. He has long shunned traditional news conferences in favor of speaking directly to his base on Twitter, not unlike President Trump, whom Bolsonaro has said he admires. Now as president, his off-the-cuff comments have become a political liability to cabinet members and allies in Congress, who scramble to play down his remarks. Last week, the president jeopardized pension reform negotiations crucial to Brazil\u2019s economic recovery when he told reporters at a breakfast meeting that he would be willing to lower the age at which women could retire, contradicting his economic minister\u2019s long-standing position in the debate and irking his congressional allies. Brazil\u2019s stock market fell nearly 2 percent on the news, and Bolsonaro\u2019s cabinet decided to limit the president\u2019s ability to speak on the topic, according to local reports. That same week, he revoked a job offer his justice minister had extended to political scientist Ilona Szab\u00f3 after receiving backlash from his supporters on Twitter. Szab\u00f3, an expert on crime and policing, had been offered a position on Bolsonaro\u2019s commission for crime policy and penal reform. Right-wing groups on Twitter argued that her history of left-leaning stances had no place in Bolsonaro\u2019s government. Bolsonaro\u2019s opposition in Congress has seized upon these decisions to argue that he is unfit for office. \u201cBolsonaro\u2019s tweets are, from start to finish, incompatible with the position he occupies. A president has the obligation to act with a minimum amount of decorum. He shows a lack of poise and responsibility. He is completely out of touch with reality. It is unacceptable.\u201d","36":"Mississippi\u2019s governor has signed into law one of the strictest abortion bans in the country, making it even more difficult for women to get abortions in a state where only one clinic still operates. The bill, set to take effect in July, bans abortions after a doctor can detect a fetal heartbeat during an ultrasound, unless the mother\u2019s health is at extreme risk. Heartbeats can be found just six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 before some women even know they are pregnant. Mississippi\u2019s new restrictions are part of a reinvigorated nationwide effort to limit access to abortion, propelled by Republican-dominated state legislatures and an increasingly conservative Supreme Court. This year alone, at least 11 states have introduced \u201cheartbeat bills,\u201d including Texas, Florida, Georgia, Ohio and Missouri \u2014 some of the country\u2019s most populous states. Kentucky\u2019s governor signed a similar measure last week, which a federal judge quickly blocked, questioning its constitutionality. In January, an Iowa state court did the same to a 2018 law. Right-wing and religious groups have said that they hope this rash of legislation will eventually force the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide, and that they will find a sympathetic audience in recently confirmed Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Even before Gov. Phil Bryant (R) signed Mississippi\u2019s bill, advocates were planning their legal challenge. \u201cThis ban is one of the most restrictive abortion bans signed into law, and we will take Mississippi to court to make sure it never takes effect,\u201d Hillary Schneller, a staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights in New York, said in a statement. Schneller, the American Civil Liberties Union and the abortions rights group NARAL have called the law unconstitutional and reminiscent of another recent Mississippi measure banning abortions after 15 weeks. Last year, a federal judge declared that law unconstitutional. \u201cLawmakers didn\u2019t get the message,\u201d Schneller said. \u201cThey are determined to rob Mississippians of the right to abortion.\u201d Bryant said he\u2019s ready for the court battle. \u201cWe will all answer to the good Lord one day,\u201d Bryant said in a tweet. \u201cI will say in this instance, \u2018I fought for the lives of innocent babies, even under threat of legal action.\u2019 \u201d Mississippi\u2019s legislature, where just under 14 percent of lawmakers are women, is the most male-dominated statehouse in the country. Both chambers passed the bill in a mostly party-line vote. In all, 99 men and 11 women supported it. Just one Republican, Rep. Missy McGee, voted against the bill. \u201cI cannot support legislation that makes such hard-line, final decisions for other women,\u201d McGee, who considers herself \u201cpro-life,\u201d told the Clarion Ledger. But David French, a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, argued \u201cit\u2019s time to throw down the gauntlet\u201d and abandon the strategy of limiting abortion rights through \u201cincrementalism.\" Writing in the institute\u2019s magazine, French said fetal heartbeat proposals represent the best opportunities to overturn the Roe decision and establish \u201can abortion-free zone in the United States of America.\u201d One state senator said the bill made Mississippi \u201cthe most life-friendly State in the Nation.\u201d For Mississippi\u2019s reproductive rights activists, however, the fetal heartbeat law is simply the latest offense to women in a state that already makes it extremely difficult to get abortions. Chief among these roadblocks: a severe shortage of clinics. For at least eight years, there has only been one. That usually means a long wait list. Then, when a woman actually gets an appointment, the state requires her to wait at least 24 hours for the procedure. During that time, she also needs state-mandated counseling and an ultrasound. If she\u2019s under the age of 18, both her parents or a court must also consent. \u201cIn short, it is already nearly impossible to get an abortion in Mississippi,\u201d said Kelly Krause, a Center for Reproductive Rights spokeswoman. \u201cAnd this law acts as an outright ban given all the other laws.\u201d On Twitter, a reporter at the Jackson Free Press, a local magazine, took stock of the state\u2019s standing with a handful of health statistics: Mississippi has among the highest rates of infant and child mortality, he noted, along with some of the worst clinical care for its youngest residents. \u201cBut,\u201d reporter Ashton Pittman said, \u201cwe did pass some abortion bans.\u201d Clarification: An earlier version of this article said that heartbeats can be heard just six weeks after conception.

(Evan Vucci\/AP) With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0Over the vocal objections of the Trump administration, the Senate voted 54 to 46 yesterday to cut off U.S. support for the vicious, Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. The invocation of the War Powers Act will soon be taken up in the House, where it has more than enough support to pass. Later today, the Senate is poised to pass the resolution of disapproval that rebukes President Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration at the U.S.-Mexico border. It has already advanced through the House. Seven Senate Republicans broke ranks on Yemen, and the White House now expects between 10 to 12 GOP senators will defect on today\u2019s wall vote, a senior administration official told my colleague Josh Dawsey last night. Coming from a Senate that\u2019s proved\u00a0so pliant to Trump\u2019s whims over the past two years, the back-to-back votes are significant and could foreshadow more resistance \u2014 or independence \u2014 to come. Trump has promised he will veto both bills. These would be his first vetoes since taking office. Though neither the House nor the Senate has the two-thirds necessary to override him on either one, the resolution of disapproval will provide fodder for lawyers challenging the constitutionality of the emergency declaration in courts. The one-two punch gets at the very heart of the separation of powers. Declaring war and spending money are bedrock powers assigned to Congress in the Constitution, but the legislative branch has abdicated both over time to what Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. called \u201cthe imperial presidency.\u201d Trump knows he\u2019s going to lose on the floor today, aides say, but he\u2019s trying to wrangle enough votes so that he\u2019s not embarrassed by a lopsided final count. To lock down the support of Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), for example, the administration promised that money for the wall won\u2019t be diverted from Arizona military construction projects. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) confer on Wednesday after the Senate voted to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led coalition fighting in Yemen. (J. Scott Applewhite\/AP) -- Senate Republicans tried to give Trump an off-ramp to defuse what could be described as a constitutional crisis, but the president wouldn\u2019t take it. The president rejected a compromise plan put forward by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), which would have allowed him to score a victory on the disapproval vote, because he did not want to foreclose the possibility of using emergency powers again in the future to advance policy objectives that Congress does not support. Indeed, if he gets away with this \u201cemergency,\u201d it seems like a pretty safe bet he\u2019ll be emboldened to try it again \u2014 as will future Democratic presidents. We\u2019re standing on a slippery slope. \u201cTrump called Lee to express his opposition as Lee lunched with fellow Republican senators at the Capitol. \u2026 Lee then relayed the information to his colleagues,\u201d Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and John Wagner report. \u201cMany Senate Republicans had started to align behind Lee\u2019s measure, which would amend the National Emergencies Act to say an emergency declaration would automatically expire after 30 days unless both chambers of Congress vote to keep it. The goal is to give Congress the authority to approve a national emergency declaration \u2014 not to disapprove it, as is currently the case in law. If it had become law, Lee\u2019s bill could have affected Trump\u2019s national border emergency in the future, since ongoing national emergency declarations must be reaffirmed annually. And it would have affected future national emergencies declared by Trump, as well as by other presidents.\u201d Lee also sponsored the Yemen resolution with Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). His father, Rex Lee, was Ronald Reagan\u2019s solicitor general, and he clerked for Sam Alito when the future justice sat on the Third Circuit. The 47-year-old defeated an incumbent GOP senator in 2010 by promising Utahans that he\u2019d stand up to presidents in both parties. \u201cCongress is supposed to be the first among the federal government\u2019s three co-equal branches,\u201d Lee said in a statement. \u201cFor decades, Congress has been giving far too much legislative power to the executive branch.\u201d -- On the national emergency vote, we\u2019ve got a running whip count on our website. Kate Rabinowitz has compiled what every Republican senator has said about Trump\u2019s declaration. -- Twenty defections would be needed to override the veto, as Republicans have a 53-to-47 majority and Vice President Pence can cast a tiebreaking vote. No one thinks that will happen. -- The failure to make a deal with conservatives who wanted to find a way out is another indication of Pence\u2019s limited juice. He can\u2019t effectively speak for Trump when he\u2019s on the Hill, and he\u2019s not empowered to negotiate the way Joe Biden was, partly because he\u2019s been undercut so many times by POTUS. \u201cThere was an effort, numerous efforts, to engage with the vice president and the president,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.). But \u201cthe president is not persuaded. I don\u2019t know of any president that likes to give up power.\u201d Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) talks with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) before the State of the Union last month. (Mandel Ngan\/AFP\/Getty Images) -- Trump has tried to reframe his power grab not as a constitutional question, but as a matter of national security. \u201cRepublican Senators are overthinking [the] vote on National Emergency,\u201d he tweeted yesterday. \u201cIt is very simply Border Security\/No Crime \u2014 Should not be thought of any other way.\u201d -- But a lot of principled conservatives and libertarians don\u2019t see it that way. Indeed, today\u2019s vote will become a legacy-defining litmus test for many senators who fancy themselves as constitutionalists. \u201cThrough the legal fiction of an emergency, the old rules that governed America, and ensured some democratic check on executive power, are sidelined,\u201d writes National Review\u2019s Michael Brendan Dougherty. \u201cI happen to think Congress should fund more-extensive border security, including fencing. But conservatives have to defend the constitutional order that gives government acts the savor of legitimacy. That means Congress must reassert itself.\u201d -- Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) is in that camp. \u201cI would literally lose my political soul if I decided to treat President Trump different than President Obama,\u201d the senator wrote in an op-ed for Fox News. \u201cEvery single Republican I know decried President Obama\u2019s use of executive power to legislate. We were right then. But the only way to be an honest officeholder is to stand up for the same principles no matter who is in power.\u201d Paul predicts the Supreme Court will \u201clikely\u201d strike down the declaration. \u201cIn fact, I think the president\u2019s own picks to the Supreme Court may rebuke him on this,\u201d he said. \u201cWith regard to the Constitution, the Supreme Court made it very clear in Youngstown Steel in 1952 \u2026 that there are three kinds of executive orders: orders that carry out an expressly voiced congressional position, orders where Congress\u2019 will is unclear, and, finally, orders clearly opposed to the will of Congress. \u2026 Without question, the president\u2019s order for more wall money contradicts the will of Congress. \u2026 My oath is to the Constitution, not to any man or political party.\u201d -- In the Youngstown case that Paul refers to, the Supreme Court blocked Harry Truman from seizing steel mills during the Korean War. In a recent piece for the American Conservative magazine that decried Trump\u2019s declaration, Republican lawyer Bruce Fein \u2014 a veteran of Reagan\u2019s Justice Department \u2014 recalled Robert Jackson\u2019s concurrence in the 1952 case. \u201cWith all its defects, delays and inconveniences, men have discovered no technique for long preserving free government except that the Executive be under the law, and that the law be made by parliamentary deliberations,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cOnly scrupulous adherence to constitutional processes will keep the law supreme in America,\u201d Fein added. -- James Madison, the architect of the Constitution, doesn\u2019t get to vote in the Senate today. But he argued poignantly, and timelessly, in Federalist 58 that Congress having the power of the purse is one of the people\u2019s most important checks on tyranny: \u201cThis power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\u201d WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Beto O\u2019Rourke is officially running for president.

And in a zero-sum world, his astounding run against Cruz in last year\u2019s Texas Senate race, historic as it was, was still a loss. ... \u201cO\u2019Rourke is acutely aware, too, of perhaps his biggest vulnerability \u2014 being a white man in a Democratic Party yearning for a woman or a person of color. ...\u00a0\u2018The government at all levels is overly represented by white men,\u2019 he says. \u2018That\u2019s part of the problem, and I\u2019m a white man. So if I were to run, I think it\u2019s just so important that those who would comprise my team looked like this country. ...\u00a0I totally understand people who will make a decision based on the fact that almost every single one of our presidents has been a white man, and they want something different for this country. And I think that\u2019s a very legitimate basis upon which to make a decision. Especially in the fact that there are some really great candidates out there right now.\u201d What do Beto\u2019s kids think of him running?

Dance: \u201cA grand jury in New York has subpoenaed records from at least two prominent makers of smartphones and other devices, according to two people who were familiar with the requests and who insisted on anonymity to discuss confidential legal matters.

(AP) \u00a0\u00a0 THE UNFRIENDLY SKIES: -- Following days of resistance,\u00a0the FAA issued an emergency order grounding\u00a0Boeing 737 Max 8 and Max 9 jets after the agency received new evidence pointing to similarities between the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia. Luz Lazo, Michael Laris, Lori Aratani and Damian Paletta report: \u201cTrump announced the abrupt about-face Wednesday, after U.S. officials found themselves nearly alone in allowing the planes to remain in the air. As recently as Wednesday morning, both Boeing and the FAA had continued to say it was safe for the planes to fly. ...\u00a0The investigation into the causes of the Ethiopian Airlines crash is in the earliest stages, and it is not clear whether hardware problems, software problems or some combination of factors caused the crash.\u201d -- Here are the issues the Ethiopia\u00a0and Indonesia crashes have in common, per Emily Rauhala:\u00a0 -- Trump privately disparaged the Boeing 737, which he said\u00a0\u201csucked,\u201d before he ordered the grounding.\u00a0Toluse Olorunnipa\u00a0and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cThe president said Boeing 737s paled in comparison to the Boeing 757 ... which he owns as a personal jet. ... He questioned why Boeing would keep building the model and opined that he never would have bought a 737 for the Trump Shuttle, the small airline he briefly ran three decades ago that relied on 727s before going bankrupt.\u00a0...\u00a0Trump added to the confusion Wednesday by suggesting that the decision to ground the plane was 'psychologically'\u00a0important but was neither urgent nor conclusive. ...\u00a0The equivocation reflected an administration that was reluctant to take the step of imposing a nationwide suspension initially opposed by Boeing, the country\u2019s second-largest federal contractor.\u201d\u00a0 Trump should not have been the person making this decision, aviation experts said:\u00a0\u201cTrump was inclined to announce a grounding on Tuesday, but he received pushback from the FAA, which had not yet reached a decision, according to officials familiar with the deliberations. But Trump also equivocated himself, telling advisers that grounding planes would cause panic and could hurt the stock market, according to two people who spoke to him. Federal regulators usually take the lead on making decisions related to safety, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group. 'It\u2019s not the president\u2019s decision and it should never be the president\u2019s decision,' he said, adding that he did not know whether Trump broke any protocols.\u201d -- Trump wanted his personal pilot, John Dunkin, to become the FAA administrator, a position that\u2019s remained vacant since Barack Obama\u2019s appointee finished his term in January 2018. The absence of an FAA leader has been noticeable amid the Boeing fallout. Following an inquiry from The Washington Post, the White House declined to say whether Trump is still considering Dunkin for the job, or whether he plans to nominate someone in light of the pressure facing the agency. (Isaac Stanley-Becker) -- Wednesday's order grounds more than 70 U.S. aircraft. The Max 8 planes\u00a0are used by American and Southwest airlines, which have a combined 58 of them in their fleets. United Airlines has 14 of the planes in its fleet. -- In\u00a0November, a group of\u00a0pilots\u00a0met with Boeing executives to raise concerns about the 737 jet and complain\u00a0about being left in the dark on some of the plane's new software. The meeting happened shortly after the Lion Air flight crashed off the coast of Indonesia. Aaron Gregg, Jonathan O'Connell, Andrew Ba Tran and Faiz Siddiqui report: \u201cAfter the crash, Boeing issued a bulletin disclosing that this line of planes, known as the 737 Max 8, was equipped with a new type of software as part of the plane\u2019s automated functions. Some pilots were furious that they were not told about the new software when the plane was unveiled. Dennis Tajer, a 737 captain who attended the meeting with Boeing executives, recalled, 'They said, \u2018Look, we didn\u2019t include it because we have a lot of people flying on this and we didn\u2019t want to inundate you with information.\u2019\u00a0...\u00a0Tajer said that the 737 training Boeing offered before the Lion Air crash involved an iPad course that took less than an hour to complete. ... \u201cThe software, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), can in some rare but dangerous situations override pilot control inputs unless it is switched off. This can interfere with pilots\u2019 longtime training that pulling back on the control yoke raises a plane\u2019s nose, putting the plane into a climb. That means that as a pilot tries to maneuver an airplane, the automated system may be counteracting that pilot\u2019s inputs.\u201d -- After the Ethio\u00adpian crash on Sunday, Boeing said it would update flight-control software, something it might have done sooner if not for the government shutdown.\u00a0The company and the FAA had been working to hash out the update but it was delayed because of the longest shutdown in U.S. history and differences of opinion, per the\u00a0Wall Street Journal's Andrew Tangel and Andy Pasztor: \u201cU.S. aviation regulators are expected to mandate the change by the end of April.\u201d Matthew Whitaker \"did not deny\" talking to Trump about Cohen, according to a House Democrat. (Jonathan Ernst\/Reuters) THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\u00a0 -- During a closed-door interview with the House Judiciary Committee, former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker \u201cdid not deny\u201d that he and Trump personally discussed the government's case against his former lawyer Michael Cohen, according to\u00a0Democratic chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.). Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201c\u2018Unlike in the hearing room, Mr. Whitaker did not deny that the president called him to discuss the Michael Cohen case and personnel decisions in the Southern District,\u2019 Nadler said following his meeting with Whitaker on Wednesday, referring to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York, which brought the case against Cohen. \u2026 \u201cAccording to Nadler, Whitaker did not deny that he had been 'directly involved in conversations about whether to fire one or more U.S. attorneys.' He also did not deny that he had been 'involved in conversations about the scope' of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman\u2019s recusal from the Cohen case, Nadler said, and whether subordinate prosecutors at the Southern District of New York 'went too far' pursuing the campaign finance case in which Cohen has implicated Trump. \u201cThe committee\u2019s ranking Republican, Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), who was present for Wednesday\u2019s interview with Whitaker, called Nadler\u2019s summary an 'interpretation'\u00a0and 'overreach,' while a Republican staff lawyer also present for the meeting said Whitaker simply could not remember ever conversing with Trump about Cohen\u2019s case.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Wednesday\u2019s meeting was not transcribed, complicating the matter of resolving Nadler\u2019s and Collins\u2019s diverging interpretations of Whitaker\u2019s account. But Whitaker\u2019s non-denials are raising questions among Trump\u2019s critics about whether his public testimony was accurate.\u201d\u00a0 -- Paul Manafort was sentenced to a total of nearly eight years in prison for conspiracy and fraud. Spencer S. Hsu, Rachel Weiner and Ann E. Marimow: \u201cIn federal court Wednesday, Judge Amy Berman Jackson criticized Manafort and his attorneys for repeatedly casting his hard fall from power as collateral damage from the special counsel\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. \u2026 For Manafort\u2019s crimes of illegally lobbying in Ukraine and hiding the proceeds overseas, then encouraging witnesses to lie on his behalf, Jackson\u2019s terms added 43 months to the 47 months he received in Alexandria federal court last week for bank and tax fraud. Her total sentence was 73 months in the D.C. case, but Jackson said 30 of those would overlap with the tally in Virginia. \u2026 Asked if he would pardon Manafort, Trump said, \u2018I have not even given it a thought, as of this moment. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s right now on my mind.\u2019\u201d -- Just minutes after Jackson handed down the sentence, a New York grand jury indicted Manafort on charges of residential mortgage fraud \u2014 charges that fall outside Trump\u2019s pardon power. Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report: \u201cUnder the Constitution, presidents have wide authority to pardon, but that power applies only to federal convictions, not state cases. \u2026 New York State Attorney General Letitia James has urged the legislature to fix what Democrats call a \u2018double-jeopardy loophole\u2019 in state law that could negate New York\u2019s ability to prosecute anyone pardoned by the president. \u2026 New York lawmakers were working this week to undo the pardon loophole. \u2026 The state charges could be challenged in the courts as a violation of double jeopardy protections for defendants, an area in which current New York law may favor Manafort.\u201d -- A top prosecutor on Bob Mueller\u2019s team is stepping down from the Justice Department, the latest and maybe biggest clue that the special counsel's investigation might soon wrap up. NPR\u2019s Carrie Johnson reports: \u201cAndrew Weissmann, the architect of the case against Manafort, will study and teach at New York University and work on a variety of public service projects, including his longstanding interest in preventing wrongful convictions by shoring up forensic science standards used in courts.\u201d\u00a0 -- Introducing a new character in this saga: Robert Costello, a\u00a0New York lawyer with connections to Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, told Michael Cohen in an April 2018 email that he could \u201csleep well tonight\u201d because he had \u201cfriends in high places\u201d \u2014\u00a0though he did not specifically mention a possible pardon from the president,\u00a0CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger and Jeremy Herb report: \u201cCohen, in his closed-door congressional testimony, has provided these emails in an effort to corroborate his claim that a pardon was dangled before he decided to cooperate with federal prosecutors, according to sources familiar with his testimony. \u2026 But the attorney who wrote those emails, Robert Costello, told CNN that Cohen's interpretation of events is \u2018utter nonsense.\u2019 Costello said that Cohen asked him to raise the issue of a pardon with Giuliani.\u201d -- Costello said he's preparing to deliver all the emails to federal prosecutors at the U.S. attorney's office, which requested them after CNN's story.\u00a0Colby Itkowitz and Matt Zapotosky report: Costello \u201caccused Cohen or his lawyer of having \u2018selectively\u2019 leaked copies of their email exchanges \u2018to bolster the false narrative that they originally tried to peddle in the media last week.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018This statement: \u2018Sleep Well tonight, you have friends in high places\u2019 was a tongue-in-cheek reference to a Garth Brooks song, to a client whose state of mind was highly disturbed and had suggested to us that he was suicidal. We were simply trying to be decent human beings. There is no hidden message,\u2019 Costello said.\u00a0 -- Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) rejected calls from House Republicans for an investigation into whether Cohen lied to Congress during his testimony two weeks ago. The Oversight chairman, however, left open the possibility of further action against Trump\u2019s former lawyer if new evidence of perjury is uncovered.\u00a0 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have been tapping into a privately maintained database of license plates. (Marlon Correa\/The Washington Post) THE REST OF THE AGENDA:\u00a0 -- Immigration agents have been tapping into a vast and privately maintained database of license plate numbers gathered from vehicles across the nation to track immigrants who may be in the United States\u00a0illegally. Drew Harwell and Tony Romm report: \u201cThe records the ACLU obtained from the Department of Homeland Security through a Freedom of Information Act request shed new light on a little-noticed and expanding network of surveillance that has developed over the years and for which there appear to be few legal limitations. \u2026 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s use of some of the information in states including California also appears to skirt limitations that \u2018sanctuary cities\u2019 have placed on police cooperation with the immigration agency, the ACLU said. \u2026 ICE spokesman Matthew Bourke said that agents use the license-plate database as a tool to help in its immigration-enforcement investigations and that it does not use the information to track people \u2018who have no connection to ICE investigatory or enforcement activities.\u2019\u201d -- For its upcoming mission to the moon, NASA is considering using commercial alternatives instead of the long-delayed rocket it\u2019s been working on for years.

(Seung Min Kim) Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaks in Parliament ahead of the latest\u00a0Brexit vote. (Jessica Taylor\/Reuters)\u00a0 THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- The British Parliament rejected a no-deal departure twice, signaling that lawmakers are\u00a0likely to ask the other 27 members of the European Union\u00a0for permission to delay Brexit. William Booth, Karla Adam and Michael Birnbaum report: \u201cThe no-deal votes were in many ways symbolic \u2014 taking the temperature of Parliament, rather than setting concrete policy. \u2026 [Prime Minister Theresa] May said her government could ask the E.U. for a short extension to implement a deal if it passed by next week. If no deal is passed, May said she would be forced to seek a much longer delay. \u2026 A longer delay would require Britain to participate in European Parliament elections in May.\u201d -- The Pentagon is preparing to test missiles that have been banned by the INF Treaty. Paul Sonne reports: \u201cThe U.S. military plans to test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range of about 600 miles in August and a midrange ballistic missile with a range of about 1,800 to 2,500 miles in November \u2026 The testing, production and deployment of missiles with those ranges is prohibited by the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. But Trump withdrew from the treaty on Feb. 1 and triggered a formal six-month wait period before the final expiry of the agreement this summer. \u2026 Washington has said Moscow is already deploying a missile that violates the agreement and cited that weapon as a reason for its withdrawal from the pact. The Kremlin has denied that accusation.\u201d\u00a0 -- The United States\u00a0and the Taliban have drafted an agreement on the withdrawal of American troops and the Taliban\u2019s pledge to cut ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. NBC News\u2019s\u00a0Dan De Luce reports: \u201cThe talks between the Taliban insurgents and U.S. diplomats have lasted longer than any previous American attempt at negotiation with the militants since American troops entered Afghanistan in 2001. But it's unclear if the Afghan government and other Afghan political leaders will be ready to embrace the tentative deal worked out by [U.S. presidential envoy] Zalmay Khalilzad. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has expressed concerns that the Kabul government could be left out in the cold unless the Taliban agrees to meet face-to-face with his government.\u201d\u00a0 -- Power has been restored to Venezuela following nearly a week of darkness, according to the country\u2019s information minister. At its worst, the power outage left 19 out of 23 states without energy. (CNN) -- The outage left the country\u2019s second-largest city, Maracaibo, devastated as looters broke into hundreds of businesses. The AP\u2019s Sheyla Urdaneta reports. -- Ten of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most prominent women\u2019s rights activists appeared in court in Riyadh for the start of a trial that could signal whether the government will roll back an aggressive crackdown on political activists. Kareem Fahim reports: \u201cMany of the women have been tortured while in custody, according to relatives and human rights groups. Saudi officials deny those allegations. \u2026 ALQST, a Saudi rights group based in London, said Wednesday that the women are being charged under the country\u2019s Cyber Crime law with offenses related to their activism, including contacting human rights groups. The charges carry sentences of up to five years in prison.\u201d\u00a0 -- This \u201csham trial\u201d exposes Saudi Arabia\u2019s disrespect for its citizens, writes Hala Al-Dosari, a Saudi activist and scholar and The Washington Post\u2019s first Jamal Khashoggi fellow: \u201cThe women have been subjected to horrific torture and sexual harassment, but in a statement the government claimed the accused were enjoying their full rights. Meanwhile, state-linked social media accounts have already virtually convicted the activists and are asking for the maximum punishment. ... Against this background, Saudi Arabia decided to appoint its first female ambassador to the United States, Princess Reema bint Bandar. It\u2019s another opportunity to push an apologetic reform narrative amid U.S. congressional scrutiny and pressure. Many will take the bait, as they did when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first came to power. In our collective conscience as a nation, these female activists facing trial \u2014 and the men who support them \u2014 were instrumental in influencing reforms.\u201d\u00a0 -- Gary Cohn, Trump\u2019s former economic adviser, said the president is \u201cdesperate\u201d for a trade deal with China.\u00a0David J. Lynch reports: \u201c\u2019The president needs a win,\u2019 Cohn said in an interview with Freakonomics, a public radio show and podcast.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Cohn said he supported the president\u2019s desire to crack down on unfair Chinese trade practices, but he said tariffs \u2018don\u2019t work.\u2019 As evidence, he pointed to last year\u2019s\u00a0record $891 billion trade deficit in merchandise\u00a0and the record $419 billion gap in trade with China. \u2018So tariffs were used as the threat. Did it hurt the Chinese at all? We had record trade deficits,\u2019 Cohn said.\u201d Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz often talks about growing up in a public housing project.\u00a0(Joe Raedle\/Getty Images) GET TO KNOW HOWARD SCHULTZ:\u00a0 -- Billionaire Howard Schultz often talks at length about his experience growing up as in a Brooklyn public housing building, describing it as \u201clow-income\u201d housing where fights \u201cdidn\u2019t typically escalate to deadly violence, but they were tough in their own way.\u201d But his description of Bayview as a rough, low-income community doesn\u2019t match the city\u2019s definition of the project. Marc Fisher reports: \u201c\u2018It was a shiny, wonderful world,\u2019 said former Bayview resident Elyse Maltz, one of many residents of the development who contend that Schultz, 65, has distorted the reality of the place where they grew up in the 1950s and \u201960s. \u2018Everything was brand spanking new.\u2019 Maltz ... [said Bayview] \u2018was middle-class, not lower middle. You were interviewed to get in. My family was pretty well off. I know Howard wants to look like he\u2019s rags to riches, but we had a wonderful, plentiful life. I mean, my ma had a cleaning lady. We really didn\u2019t lack for anything.\u2019 \u2026\u00a0 \u201cIn 1956, the New York City Housing Authority opened Bayview as a \u2018moderate income\u2019 development, built a block away from Jamaica Bay \u2026 Superficially, Bayview looked much like any city housing development, a collection of brick towers with balky stainless-steel elevators and hallways of green linoleum floors and glazed, aqua-tiled walls. But Bayview, which Schultz\u2019s family moved into in its opening year, was built as a \u2018no cash subsidy\u2019 project, according to city records. That meant that unlike developments subsidized by the federal or state government, Bayview had minimum income requirements for tenants, charged higher rents intended to cover the entire cost of its mortgage, and was \u2018built to high standards compared to [federal] projects,\u2019 according to \u2018Affordable Housing in New York,\u2019 a history of public housing in the city.\u201d\u00a0 -- In a speech to Miami Dade College detailing how he would run the government, Schultz vowed that he would not sign bills that aren\u2019t passed with bipartisan support and said he will nominate only Supreme Court justices who could be confirmed by two-thirds of the Senate \u2014 a naive statement for anyone who has been watching the judicial wars.\u00a0Michael Scherer reports: \u201c\u2018The courts have become yet another battlefield in the ongoing war between Democratic and Republican leaders,\u2019 Schultz said. \u2018These battles have undermined our faith in the rule of law and the impartiality of the entire judicial system. All of this has to change.\u2019 He said he would fill his cabinet with Democrats, Republicans and Independents, including \u2018a greater share of women than any previous president.\u2019 \u2026 He promised to work to end the practice of partisan gerrymandering, drawing legislative and congressional districts to preserve one party\u2019s power. That process is controlled by the states, not Washington, but Schultz said he would push for independent commissions to draw those districts in the future.\u201d -- Big Democratic donors are sending their money to four key states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida and Pennsylvania. The\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u2019s Julie Bykowicz reports: \u201cTwo of the Democrats\u2019 best-funded outside groups \u2014 both of which are backed in part by New York billionaire George Soros \u2014 are planning at least a $130 million campaign to attack President Trump and build support for Democrats in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida, where Mr. Trump narrowly prevailed over Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. A third group, an $80 million voter-engagement effort, is at work in these and three other battleground states. \u2026 The latest Democratic spending commitment comes from opposition research group American Bridge 21st Century, which plans to put at least $30 million largely into the four states.\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Conservative lawyer George Conway, the husband of top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, called Trump a \u201cpathological\u201d liar after the president falsely insisted that the judge in Manafort\u2019s case cleared him of collusion. \u201cIt\u2019s not rational, because it\u2019s a lie that no reasonable person would believe,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt undermines his credibility.

In prior years, lobbyists and consultants felt compelled to work officials in all corners of the federal bureaucracy when trying to shape policy. But now, with decision-making consolidated inside the Oval Office, they\u2019ve had to rewrite their playbook. \u2018It\u2019s two different worlds,\u2019 says Eric Bovim, a managing director of Signal Group, a public-affairs agency in Washington. \u2018Under President Obama, the government was a finely tuned instrument, all the parts working together to produce a single note. You needed to work with everybody to calibrate the sound. Today, for the most part, it\u2019s a one-man band, the President in a never-ending guitar solo on the White House lawn, overpowering all the other instruments.\u2019\u201d -- New York Times, \u201cInside the Pricey, Totally Legal World of College Consultants,\u201d by Dana Goldstein and Jack Healy: \u201cThe government\u2019s indictments of dozens of parents, college administrators and coaches exposed an ugly array of corrupt and illegal admissions practices. But there is also a perfectly legal world of gaming the college admissions process by doing everything from picking advanced classes, choosing the right sport, giving donations and turning to the multibillion-dollar industry of test prep, college essay editing and advice on how to produce the perfect application. Every aspect of a teenager\u2019s life can be managed and shaped into a persona catered to please the exacting eye of a college admissions officer. Parents might pay $300 for a standard, hourlong consultation with an admissions expert or donate tens of millions to schools, with the hope of winning special consideration for their child\u2019s bid for a spot at a top school.\u201d\u00a0 -- The Atlantic, \u201cAn Abandoned Baby\u2019s DNA Condemns His Mother,\u201d by Sarah Zhang: \u201cThirty-eight years ago, an infant boy \u2014 hours old, tears frozen on his face \u2014 was found dead in a ditch in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

While they\u2019ve been relatively steady throughout his two years in the White House, the government shutdown has pushed his approval rating as low as it\u2019s been at basically any point. One number in the most recent Washington Post-ABC News poll might be more troubling. According to the poll, 56 percent of registered voters \u2014 a clear and statistically significant majority \u2014 say they will \u201cdefinitely\u201d not vote for Trump in his 2020 reelection bid. That number echoes a recent finding from Marist College, which found 57 percent said they would definitely not support Trump. But the number in the newer poll suggests the opposition is even firmer, and that\u2019s because of the options that the poll\u2019s question provides. In the Marist poll, the options were definitely vote against Trump (57 percent) or definitely vote for him (30 percent). An additional 13 percent volunteered that they weren\u2019t sure. That\u2019s bad enough. But the Post-ABC poll provided the option that asks if people would \u201cconsider voting for him.\u201d Giving people a third option in polling tends to pull them away from the extremes to a safer and less committal middle ground. But judging by this poll, that definitely-not-voting-for-Trump segment is resolute in its stance. The breakdown (56, 14, 28) in the Post-ABC poll is almost exactly the same as the Marist findings (57, 13, 30). While only about three-fourths of Republicans said in the Marist poll that they\u2019re definitely voting for Trump, it\u2019s similarly depressed in the Post-ABC poll, at just 70 percent. There are some important caveats. The first is that all polling is a snapshot in time. Just because things are like this, it doesn\u2019t mean they will remain the same. Trump is at a low point because the government shutdown reflected poorly on him and perhaps because the stock market has been struggling. Things can and will change for him, for the better or for the worse. The second is that Trump may not need those 56 percent of voters. He won the presidency, after all, with just 46 percent of the popular vote \u2014 about two points higher than the 44 percent who are at least open to supporting his reelection. He could win with even less of the vote if a third-party\/independent candidate, like former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, splits the vote three ways. This is registered voters; the actual electorate could draw disproportionately from people who might vote for Trump if they are more enthusiastic. But these numbers can\u2019t be described as anything except bad. Even at his low point ahead of his 2012 reelection, the highest number of Americans who said they would definitely not vote for Barack Obama was 47 percent \u2014 shy of a majority. About half as many said they would definitely vote for him, as is the case with Trump, but Obama\u2019s ceiling was considerably higher \u2014 by nine points, in fact. We tend to forget that a big reason Trump won was because of some unique factors \u2014 not least of which was an opponent, Hillary Clinton, who was about as unpopular as he was. In an election against an opponent who was even modestly unpopular (as in 45 percent of voters liking the candidate and 55 percent disliking the candidate, as opposed to Clinton\u2019s 40-60 split), Trump probably would have lost. He won by less than one percentage point in the states that mattered. At this point, Trump\u2019s reelection hopes seem to lean heavily on the possibility that his opponent will be about as disliked as Clinton. Trump may also benefit from the powers of incumbency that have resulted in recent presidents winning reelection. At least for now, though, a strong majority of registered voters say they won\u2019t participate in that reelection.","39":"No one answered when a social worker knocked on the door. Not Shana Decree or her three children. Not her sister or her three children. All was quiet inside unit S-7 at Robert Morris Apartments \u2014 because most of the people who lived there were dead, police said. It\u2019s not clear why the case worker was checking on the apartment in Morrisville, Pa., near the Delaware River. But when there was no response Monday afternoon, she asked a maintenance worker to unlock the door, according to court documents. The scene inside was straight from nightmares: overturned furniture, shattered glass and clutter throughout the home. Two disoriented women. And five bodies, including those of three children, in a backroom. The details come from an affidavit for probable cause, which accuses Shana Selena Decree, 45, and her daughter, Dominique Klaran Decree, 19 \u2014 the two who were found alive \u2014 of killing the other five. Relatives say religion may have played a role. The two women are each facing five counts of criminal homicide as well as one count of conspiracy to commit criminal homicide. It was not immediately clear who is representing them. Authorities have identified the victims as Shana Decree\u2019s children Naa\u2019Irah Smith, 25, and Damon Decree Jr., 13; Shana Decree\u2019s sister, Jamilla Campbell, 42; and Campbell\u2019s 9-year-old twin daughters, Imani and Erika Allen. Another relative, Campbell\u2019s 17-year-old son, Joshua, has been found unharmed, authorities said. Authorities said that there are no other suspects in the case. \u201cI am sure that you\u2019re going to ask me why this has occurred and what the motivation is, and as confusing as it was last night, we are no closer to understanding that in the harsh light of day,\u201d Bucks County District Attorney Matthew D. Weintraub said during a news conference Tuesday. \u201cWe will continue to pursue every lead and to work this case to its just conclusion. I expect that will be a long and laborious process, but we will always keep Naa\u2019Irah, Damon, Jamilla, Erika and Imani first and foremost in our minds and our hearts as we work to get justice for them.\u201d Weintraub told reporters Tuesday that authorities are investigating the brutal massacre to determine how exactly the family members died, when it happened and why they may have been killed. When asked whether it may have been a murder-suicide pact, the district attorney said that was a \u201cpotentiality.\u201d Destiny Harris, who is the half sister of the twins, Erika and Imani, told ABC affiliate WPVI that the family was \u201cgoing through something religiously and they decided to drag the kids into it.\u201d Damon Decree, Sr., Shana\u2019s ex-husband and Dominique\u2019s father, told the station that they had been \u201ctalking about demons being all around them.\u201d \u201cApparently they had dissected into some type of cult that they materialized online,\u201d he said of the family. \u201cI don\u2019t know how or what kind of cult.\u201d Police responded to the home about 4 p.m. Monday and found Shana and Dominique Decree \u201cdisoriented\u201d in bed. The two were rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment, according to court records. Meanwhile, according to the court records, police uncovered a gruesome scene in a backroom in the apartment \u2014 one person\u2019s body was face up on a bed, with his head toward the end and his right foot through the wall to the next room. Another was on the bed, and one was sitting up against it. One of the children was on the floor. And one person was under another body. During an interview with police, Shana and Dominique Decree denied knowing what had happened, then told police Campbell\u2019s boyfriend and two other men had come into the apartment and killed the victims, according to the court records. Later, Shana Decree told police the victims, including the three children, wanted to die and had been discussing suicide, according to the court records. Ultimately, police said, Shana and Dominique Decree told investigators about a complicated plan that allegedly involved some of the victims killing each other \u2014 at least one of them being choked to death \u2014 and then Shana and Dominique Decree killing the rest of them, according to the court documents. Authorities said the 17-year-old boy, who has since been found safe, was not at home during the killings. Shana Decree was arraigned in the early hours of Tuesday morning, and her daughter, Dominique, was arraigned in the afternoon. Both women are being held without bail, according to booking records. \u201cI just feel very confident that we have the two killers locked up that committed these atrocious, atrocious murders,\u201d Weintraub, the district attorney, said.

He lamented the fact he could no longer walk out of his townhouse and into an interesting \u2014 as in different \u2014 place to eat, and I nodded as he relayed how the restaurant action in the city had shifted eastward and elsewhere in recent years. On Valentine\u2019s Day, I found myself at the Pembroke in the reimagined Dupont Circle Hotel, scrolling through my phone to find my former colleague\u2019s contact.\u00a0The neighborhood\u2019s unlucky streak had been broken, with the help of a chef named Marlon Rambaran and designer Martin Brudnizki. Not only was I devouring one of the best tagines in recent memory, I was enjoying the Moroccan classic in the embrace of a blue velvet banquette and attended by a server who introduced the dish as if he made it himself.\u00a0 Rambaran, 39, is a Trinidad native who grew up in New Jersey and went on to learn the kitchen ropes in, among other restaurants, Scarpetta by Scott Conant in Miami Beach and Le Bec Fin in Philadelphia. Along with Karine Bakhoum of \u201cIron Chef\u201d fame, Rambaran originally signed on to the project as a consultant. The Irish owner of the property, Bernadette Gallagher, was taken with his French-based, globally influenced ideas and asked him to command the kitchen. Brudnizki, born in Sweden and based in both New York and London, is known worldwide for his timeless settings, including the Surf Club Restaurant in Miami and Park MGM in Las Vegas. Customers of the lounge, bar and dining room at the Dupont Circle Hotel are looking at $5 million worth of eye candy. There\u2019s no part of the Pembroke, outfitted with leather bar stools and coral couches, and set off with floor-to-ceiling windows, that doesn\u2019t make for a fashion statement. Even the napkins feel better than most. The lone fail might be the small marble tables for two, better suited for an ice cream parlor than a full-fledged restaurant. The bread basket might have to be removed to make way for the fluke crudo, but that\u2019s fine by me, because the raw fish is an edible still life arranged with bright bits of winter citrus that do a nice dance with fresh lime, olive oil and crackling fleur de sel. Does every diner get a sheet of gold leaf\u00a0the size of a cocktail napkin atop even a half portion of risotto, as I experienced? The generous garnish is impressive. So, too is the saffron-scented carnaroli rice, cooked to a fine creamy state with the help of chicken stock. An early best seller is a tender rope of grilled octopus, tweaked with chermoula, served with croquettes that split open to find purple potatoes. The lamb tagine calls to me most, however. Rambaran braises together neck, shank and shoulder, which end up on a bed of saffron-perfumed couscous set off with apricots, figs, preserved lemons and toasted almonds. Each bite goes down like a sumptuous banquet. Draws from the lunch menu include a chicken soup whose short noodles, diced bell peppers and big oval bowl separate it from the pack, and a tender chicken paillard painted with stripes of yogurt flecked with sumac and made green and racy with capers and cilantro. The entree comes with a choice of sides; herbed french fries best the candy-sweet baby carrots. Desserts hew to the tried and true. The Pembroke\u2019s apple galette, topped with creme fraiche, tastes European, admirably restrained in its sweetness.\u00a0 The alluring setting seems to bring out the best in the vest-dressed staff, whether it\u2019s mixing a revivifying French 75 at the center bar or deftly filleting Dover sole at the table. Overheard conversation suggests the restaurant could become a neighborhood fixture. \u201cI haven\u2019t been here since they remodeled,\u201d a diner near me says to his companion. \u201cNice!\u201d Rambaran likes to think of what he\u2019s cooking, subject to change with the seasons, as \u201cnot too trendy. In 20 years, we still want to be here.\u201d He and the dining room are off to a smart start.

But rescue teams expect to find more bodies as they comb an area swallowed by sludge and potentially toxic runoff from the iron-ore mine. The local governor, Romeu Zema, said the chance of finding additional survivors was slipping away. \u201cWe will likely just be rescuing bodies,\u201d he told reporters. The incident sparked a national outcry and was the second such disaster to strike Brazil in just over three years amid lax inspections of mining sites. It increased pressure on newly elected President Jair Bolsonaro to backtrack on a push to loosen rules for mining, logging and other industries. The 280-foot dam burst suddenly, sweeping away workers, animals and residents living near the plant owned by Brazil\u2019s largest mining company, Vale SA. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching the worst horror film,\u201d said 58-year-old Iara Murta, who fled her home with her two sisters after the dam burst. She said she saw bodies and livestock stuck in the river of mud and mining runoff. The waste blanketed miles of vegetation and seeped into a river, raising concerns of contamination. Firefighters uncovered a bus carrying employees in the wreckage. All onboard were dead. The incident comes a little more than three years after another dam operated by Vale burst, unleashing a surge that killed 19 people in what had been Brazil\u2019s worst industrial environmental disaster. That catastrophe left hundreds of thousands of people without drinking water, and 300 families lost their homes. Many are still waiting for compensation. \u201cHistory is repeating itself,\u201d former environmental minister Marina Silva tweeted. It is inexcusable \u201cthat the government and the mining companies have learned nothing.\u201d Vale\u2019s chief executive, F\u00e1bio Schvartsman, said he expected the human toll of Friday\u2019s disaster to surpass the 2015 incident and said the majority of victims were expected to be employees at the mine. Family members of the missing demanded answers from the company outside a community center established by Vale. \u201cThis company kills. You are killing us from the inside,\u201d they shouted. The Brazilian government fined Vale $200 million and froze $1.3 billion in the company\u2019s accounts to pay for the damage. It also gave the company 48 hours to create a compensation plan for victims and begin removing the waste. The company\u2019s shares fell 8 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. \u201cI heard an awfully loud noise,\u201d said Juvercino Rodrigues de Oliveira, 76, who was sitting in his backyard as the dam burst. \u201cIt sounded like a volcano had erupted.\u201d Although his home was not damaged, the surrounding area, including his backyard, is flooded. Nearby, a satellite dish, a water tank and some cinder blocks stick out of the field of water like the tips of icebergs in the ocean. \u201cI had 80 chickens; now only 20 remain.\u201d said Rodrigues de Oliveira. The incident marks the first environmental crisis for Bolsonaro, who was sometimes called the \u201cTrump of the tropics\u201d for his policies favoring big-business interests. Bolsonaro criticized Brazil\u2019s environmental regulatory agency on the campaign trail as a \u201cfactory of fines.\u201d Bolsonaro flew over the region Saturday morning and created a crisis committee to assess the damage. \u201cWe will do what we can to help victims, minimize damage, uncover the facts, demand justice and prevent new tragedies,\u201d Bolsonaro tweeted. \u201cFor the good of Brazil and the environment.\u201d The mine operated in Minas Gerais, a bankrupt state foundering in debt that has struggled to pay public workers. In December, the state issued Vale an accelerated license to expand the mine amid an outcry from several residents who voiced concerns about risks of the dam bursting. Inspections of mining dams fell 16 percent in 2017 during a nationwide fiscal crisis, according to Brazil\u2019s national water agency. The agency estimates there are 723 dams across the country at risk of problems.","42":"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 The Dubai-based payment processing firm Network International, which completes credit card transactions across the Middle East and North Africa, is preparing for an initial public offering.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais\/AP) Seven pharmaceutical executives sat down in a row before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday morning. Three hours later, they emerged from the hearing room relatively unscathed. In the hearing on drug prices \u2014 billed as one of the biggest Congress-vs.-industry showdowns since the tobacco hearings of the 1990s \u2014 exchanges between the lawmakers and the CEOs were remarkably unremarkable. Finance Committee\u00a0Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking Democrat\u00a0Ron Wyden (Ore.) tried to kick the hearing off energetically, both warning the executives they shouldn\u2019t try to redirect blame to other parts of the health-care industry for skyrocketing drug prices in the United States. \u201cLike most Americans, I\u2019m sick and tired of the blame game,\u201d Grassley told the panel. Wyden recounted the tobacco hearings. \u201cI was there when seven Big Tobacco CEOs testified in a committee room like this one, and they lied,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chairman and I expect better this morning.\u201d But while senators on the committee asked the executives a range of questions about the drug pipeline, there were few true \u201cgotcha\u201d moments. The witnesses frequently recited well-worn arguments for why insurers and pharmacy middlemen (called pharmacy benefit managers, or\u00a0PBMs) should share more of the blame for the high cos of prescription drugs. The senators largely refrained from insisting on direct answers as to why these companies have massively inflated\u00a0prices for specific medications. Here are your Health 202 takeaways form the hearing: 1. Drugmakers were reluctant to make firm commitments to lowering list prices even under their best-case scenario. Grassley pointed to a recent proposal from the Trump administration to ban the rebates drugmakers give to pharmacy benefit managers\u00a0\u2014 an idea enthusiastically backed by the drug industry and decried by PBMs. Grassley asked the executives whether they would agree to lower their own list prices if they were freed of paying rebates. \u201cShould the administration finalize this rule, will you commit to lowering your drug prices?\u201d Grassley asked. The executives expressed openness to the idea but stressed\u00a0the rebate ban should apply broadly to drugs covered in commercial plans and not just government-run programs \u2014 and hinted that insurers should still feel a responsibility to charge smaller co-payments to customers. \u201cIf the rebates were removed from the commercial sector as well, we would definitely reduce our list prices,\u201d AstraZeneca\u2019s Pascal Soriot said. Sanofi's Olivier Brandicourt responded: \u201cLowering list price has to be linked to better access and affordability at the counter for the patients.\u201d David Mitchell, president and founder of Patients for Affordable Drugs:\u00a0 2. Executives\u00a0did plenty\u00a0of blame-shifting. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Jennifer Taubert repeated several times that insurers and PBMs excel at extracting lower prices from drugmakers, insinuating they cut into the industry\u2019s profits without necessarily passing those savings along to consumers. \u201cWe strongly advocate for rebate reforms that would allow us to lower our list prices,\u201d Taubert said. Merck\u2019s Kenneth Frazier urged the senators to \u201crecognize the system itself is complex and it\u2019s interdependent.\u201d \u201cNo one company can unilaterally lower list prices without running into disadvantages that make it hard to do that,\u201d Frazier said. Said Soriot: \u201cIt\u2019s one of those situations where no one can fix it by themselves.\" Wyden accused drugmakers of \u201cstonewalling\u201d on the key issue of list prices. \u201cReducing those list prices are the easiest ways for American consumers to pay less at the pharmacy counter,\u201d he said. 3. Drugmakers\u00a0expressed opposition to any type of government price-setting. Several senators brought up the idea of an international drug price index suggested by the Trump administration for lowering what Medicare pays for prescription drugs distributed by doctors. The executives hit back against that idea, as well as a more far-reaching proposal to allow the government to directly negotiate lower prices in Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be good policy,\u201d Brandicourt said, in response to a line of questioning from Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.). He added that government \u201cprice controls\u201d wouldn\u2019t be sufficient to make medications affordable for consumers. Kaiser Family Foundation senior vice president Larry Levitt: 4. They all said they support the CREATES Act. All the executives claimed their companies don\u2019t try to block generic developers by withholding samples of their medications \u2014 an industry practice that would be ended by the bipartisan CREATES Act. The measure, which we\u2019ve written about here, is a top candidate for drug pricing legislation that Congress could pass this year. Yet,\u00a0as Stat News noted, a database run by the Food and Drug Administration shows Pfizer and AstraZeneca have been accused of this very practice. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.):\u00a0 5. Humira was the redheaded stepchild of the day. The skyrocketing costs of insulin came up several times, but it was really Humira, AbbVie\u2019s arthritis drug, that lawmakers chose to pummel. Humira, which is on track to the be the most profitable medication in history, now costs about $38,000 for a year\u2019s worth of treatment. Wyden, along with Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and John Cornyn (R-Tex.), focused on Humira as a prime example of how companies price gouge consumers, noting that AbbVie has dozens of patents on the drug to protect the company\u2019s exclusive right to produce it. Cornyn said he supports the patent system\u00a0because it incentivizes companies to invest in research and development of new drugs,\u00a0but he suggested AbbVie is gaming the system to protect its monopoly on Humira much longer than should be allowed. Stabenow pressured AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez to admit the medicine\u2019s chemical makeup hasn\u2019t changed despite the company\u2019s multiple patents. And Wyden said the company \u201cprotects the exclusivity of Humira like Gollum with his ring.\u201d \u201cThick cobwebs of patents, legal tricks and shadowy deals with other drugmakers, all to keep the cash flowing,\u201d Wyden said.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) proposed in 2017, our Post colleague Jeff Stein reports in this sneak peek at the bill. Here are some highlights from the plan, which has more than 100 House Democratic co-sponsors, and how it differs from Sanders's Senate bill. (Jeff also reports\u00a0Sanders is currently working on an update to his bill.) Jayapal's bill does not specify how it would pay for the new legislation.\u00a0 \u201cWe have a plan. We have a real plan,\u201d Jayapal told reporters. \u201cAmericans are literally dying because they cannot afford insulin and can\u2019t get the cancer treatments they need . . . I think this Medicare-for-all bill makes it clear what we mean by health care for all. We mean a complete transformation of our health-care system.\u201d \u201cThe bill has 106 co-sponsors but essentially no chance of passing the House or Republican-controlled Senate this term,\u201d Jeff writes. \u201cIt comes amid a wider debate about the meaning of Medicare-for-all in Democratic policy circles, as some presidential candidates and center-left think tanks have said they support both Medicare-for-all while also aiming to preserve private insurance that currently enrolls about 150 million Americans.\u201d Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.): Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) weighed in on the proposal:\u00a0 OOF: Parents are disappearing from the workforce, currently making up a smaller share of the labor force in the United States than at any other point in at least a century,\u00a0our Post colleague Andrew Van Dam writes.\u00a0 It's not that parents aren't working, but that those in the workforce aren't becoming parents, he writes.\u00a0That\u2019s where Democrats' childcare proposals, like the one released by Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u00a0(D-Mass.), could come in.\u00a0\u201cDemocratic presidential candidates are targeting the substantial group of Americans who avoid having children because they can\u2019t afford the estimated $233,610 it would take to raise a child to age 18,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe number of working parents isn\u2019t falling just because parents have decided to stay home,\u201d he continues. \u201cInstead, it\u2019s likely that working Americans are having fewer children or avoiding parenthood altogether. Birthrates and fertility rates, which account for the number of women of childbearing age, are at their lowest levels on record, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.\" Meanwhile, research suggests universal childcare could encourage people to have children. Andrew writes: \u201cBy removing one of the biggest obstacles for working parents, a universal child-care policy might encourage more parents to rejoin the labor force, [American University\u2019s Gray Kimbrough] said.\u201d The U.S. Food and Drug Administration building is seen behind a bus stop on the agency's campus in Silver Spring, Md. (Jacquelyn Martin\/AP) OUCH: The Food and Drug Administration is looking at new approaches to address opioid abuse, with measures such as small-quantity packaging and new research requirements for drug companies, the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Thomas M. Burton reports.  \u201cOne step the FDA plans for 2019 is requiring the packaging of pills in small amounts, such as for a day or two of medication following surgery, to reduce the amount of drugs that can be misused or diverted to resale after being dispensed,\u201d Thomas writes. \"The agency has been criticized from multiple directions for not having done enough to stem the pain-pill addiction epidemic, and for the ways it allegedly enabled it in the first place by approving dangerously powerful painkillers for widespread use,\" he adds. The FDA has responded to criticisms by teasing further measures, such as additions to painkiller-safety programs that aim\u00a0to reduce fentanyl prescriptions.\u00a0 Our Post colleagues Lenny Bernstein and Laurie McGinley wrote earlier this week about the agency\u2019s plans to require drug companies to study opioid effectiveness. \u2014 After yesterday's drug-pricing hearing, Cornyn told reporters he spoke with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) about concerns raised during the hearing and said the panel plans to probe how drugmakers work the patent system, the Hill\u2019s Peter Sullivan reports. \u201cHe said he would work with me in the Judiciary Committee, which would have jurisdiction over that, to both investigate it and come up with any curative legislation, if warranted,\u201d Cornyn said. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.). (Salwan Georges\/The Washington Post) \u2014 The House Oversight Committee voted to authorize Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) to subpoena three Trump administration officials for records on the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that led to the separation of families at the border with Mexico. In a bipartisan 25-to-11 vote \u2014 Republican Reps. Chip Roy (Tex.) and Justin Amash (Mich.) joined the panel\u2019s Democrats \u2014 the committee voted to subpoena Attorney General William P. Barr, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar for records related to the policy, our Post colleagues Felicia, Nick Miroff and Maria Sacchetti report.\u00a0 \u201cThese subpoenas will be the first issued by the committee in the 116th Congress,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cI did not make this decision lightly. As many of you know, I have been passionate about this issue since it first became public last year, and I believe it is a true national emergency.\u201d HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said in a statement the agency \u201cunderstands and appreciates the important role of Congressional oversight and has communicated regularly and in good faith\u201d with the committee.\u00a0She\u00a0added officials\u00a0\"have transparently provided 792 pages of documents related to the Committee\u2019s request and offered their staff a review of the Office of Refugee Resettlement portal at the Department.\u201d \u2014 At another hearing on Capitol Hill, Trump officials being grilled by members of the House Judiciary Committee acknowledged they did not speak up to supervisors despite warnings that the family separations could traumatize children, our Post colleagues Felicia, Nick and Maria\u00a0report.\u00a0 Jonathan White, commander of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and child welfare expert, told lawmakers\u00a0he warned HHS officials in spring 2017 that the \"zero tolerance\" policy would traumatize children and inflict long-term harm. Scott Lloyd, then-director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the HHS agency in charge of caring for separated children, was one of the officials White warned. But Lloyd told lawmakers yesterday that he didn\u2019t relay those warnings. \u00a0 \u201cDid you ever say to the administration: \u2018This is a bad idea\u2019?\u201d Rep. Jayapal asked Lloyd in one exchange. \u201cHere\u2019s what my child welfare experts have told us: \u2018We need to stop this policy.\u2019 Did you once say this to anybody above you?\u201d \u201cI did not say those words,\u201d Lloyd answered. Today From the Fact Checker:\u00a0Did Ivanka Trump create 'millions' of jobs?:","44":"There are many reasons to be cautious about the presidential prospects of former vice president Joe Biden. The obstacles in his path and doubts about him as a candidate are well-known, including to those in his inner circle. Still, there is a belief among those loyal to Biden that, notwithstanding the questions, the 2020 campaign could be uniquely set up to his advantage, as the electorate decides whether to continue the presidency of Donald Trump or end it after a single term. This is why Biden is leaning strongly toward running. Four years ago, after the tragic death of his son Beau, Biden spent months weighing whether to run for his party\u2019s nomination. He did not really want to say no but, for family and other reasons, could not bring himself to say yes. He simply let the clock run out and acceded to the reality that it was too late to run. This time, as one decision deadline after another has slipped away, some people have speculated that the same thing could be happening. But this time is different. Four years ago, it would have been a surprise if had he challenged Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and a rising Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for the party\u2019s nomination. This time, especially now that he has the blessing of his family to run and no less desire to be president, the surprise would be if he were to say no. The timetable remains in question. As he explores his options and kicks the tires of a possible campaign operation (he is keenly focused on the digital side of things), Biden has been in no rush to declare his intentions. He resisted recommendations from some advisers to announce early in an effort to shape the race in his favor. He has chosen to wait, preferring to make himself less of a target and to see whether any of the other early entrants would significantly change the landscape. The Democratic field includes Sanders, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), Cory Booker (N.J.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former San Antonio mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, among others. Sanders, who raised a bucketful of money after announcing his candidacy, is hitting the trail this weekend with rallies in Brooklyn and Chicago. Former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, who captured imaginations of Democrats across the country during his race last year against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), could say soon whether he will run. Others will decide soon, in part based on Biden\u2019s thinking. So far, nothing has happened to dissuade Biden that waiting will cost him. Though the contest for the nomination is viewed as wide open, Biden\u2019s advisers say the former vice president\u2019s stock is underestimated, or at least underappreciated. They say Biden is not just a leader in the polls but a genuine front-runner \u2014 though, if he runs, it will not be as a classic front-runner, as he explores other, less conventional ways of conducting a campaign. His advocates say that his standing reflects something sturdier than mere near-universal name recognition. His stature that has been built up over years. Loyalists doubt that would change suddenly if he becomes a candidate. There is another characteristic that those in his orbit say he could bring to the race that few other candidates can claim: an appeal across the breadth of the party. He will have support from older Democrats certainly, but also the ability to compete for younger voters; support from men and from women; an attraction among white working-class voters as well as support from African Americans. The early weeks of the 2020 contest have been dominated by issues, by a democratic socialist agenda first championed by Sanders in 2016 that has been adopted at least rhetorically by many of the others. It has highlighted the power of the liberal wing of the party \u2014 to the enthusiasm of some and the concern of others. Should he become a candidate, Biden is prepared to become part of that debate, building on the record of the Obama presidency. Trump and the Republicans already have signaled their determination to pin the \u201csocialist\u201d label on the Democrats. Biden would resist that by countering Sanders and some of the others on the left. The Democratic race in part will be a battle of ideas. But Biden must count on electability as by far the paramount question on the minds of voters \u2014 in the primaries and the general election \u2014 because of Trump. In this formulation, the 2020 election becomes not just another presidential campaign but truly an existential moment for the country. Biden will be betting that this isn\u2019t a normal election but rather one that will turn far more on questions about fundamental values than on the specifics of Medicare-for-all or the Green New Deal \u2014 or on votes or actions from three or four decades ago. Biden has spoken publicly about his concern that, under Trump, the guardrails of democracy are being threatened, \u201csanded down, little by little, each small step designed to curb institutional safeguards and concentrate power in the hands of individual leaders,\u201d as he put it in a speech in Copenhagen last year. At the Munich Security Conference last month, he spoke of this moment as a \u201cstruggle for America\u2019s soul .\u2009.\u2009. [that] goes to who we are, what we stand for.\u201d The case he is likely to make, if he runs, would focus on two aspects of electability. First, that a majority of voters have grown weary of an experiment with a president who came to office with no experience and whose tenure has produced nonstop turmoil. Biden could argue that he has the experience to be president on day one and the temperament to calm the nation. Second, and vitally important, that he can win where Democrats must win to defeat Trump, in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Biden\u2019s earlier campaigns ended badly. He dropped out of the 1988 campaign after allegations that he plagiarized the speech of a British politician. In 2008, he never got traction against Obama and Clinton. This time he would begin after having spent eight years as vice president, a different launchpad than from a senatorial office. There are many hurdles that could trip him up. His long record as a senator will be scrutinized and evaluated in the context of today\u2019s America, of greater multiculturalism and the #MeToo moment. His handling of Anita Hill\u2019s testimony during the heated confirmation battle over Justice Clarence Thomas will be an issue. Questions about his record on abortion will come into play, as will things he said about school busing when it was a divisive issue in the 1970s. His advocacy for the 1994 crime bill, which has been widely criticized of late by African Americans and others, will be reexamined. Biden is 76 years old and has been in public life for more than four decades. He is not a new face, at a time when his party might be looking for one. He is friendly toward some Republicans at a time when many in his party brook no such behavior. His points of reference sometimes are far in the past. If that translates into the kind of experience people want, it will be an asset. If it seems he is not current enough, it might become a liability. And there is the question of whether he would take Trump\u2019s bait: demean and diminish himself by going into the gutter with the president. Does he have the discipline to run the race of his choosing? Or would he succumb to letting the president define the debate? A year ago, criticizing Trump for disrespecting women, Biden bragged that if he and Trump were still in high school, \u201cI\u2019d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.\u201d He quickly came to regret saying that and said so, but it was an indication of how easily he could slip up. His advisers respect the strength of others in the field and know there are some Democrats, even those who like and respect Biden, who would prefer to thank him for his service and ask him to move on. Nothing is assumed, nothing taken for granted about the path forward. And, he must still give the green light. If he does, he might finally reach his long-sought goal of becoming president. But only if he is able to show that he is the right candidate for this moment in history.","45":"Last summer, Wisconsin\u2019s then-governor, Scott Walker, announced a deal for Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn to open a factory in his state, and like so many such deals, it came with gigantic tax incentives. Although it was extremely controversial, Walker insisted that the 13,000 jobs Foxconn was promising would be worth the billions of taxpayer dollars he offered the company. President Trump took credit for it. As The Post reported at the time, White House officials were \u201cebullient\u201d about the deal and even stressed that Trump himself negotiated it with the company\u2019s chairman. The consummate dealmaker made a deal, and now the benefits would rain down on the good people of Wisconsin, right? Well, not so much: A major jobs deal President Trump has touted with former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker now looks uncertain: Foxconn, a supplier for Apple and other technology firms, says it\u2019s scrapping plans to build a giant new factory in Wisconsin, opting to hire American engineers and researchers instead of a promised fleet of blue-collar workers. \u201cIn Wisconsin we\u2019re not building a factory,\u201d Louis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn chief executive Terry Gou, told Reuters. \u201cYou can\u2019t use a factory to view our Wisconsin investment.\u201d The Taiwanese technology juggernaut initially pledged in 2017 to construct a $10 billion liquid-crystal display panel plant and create up to 13,000 jobs in the state\u2019s southeastern corner over the next 15 years. The positions would pay an average annual wage of $53,000, the firm said \u2014 a solid salary in the manufacturing realm. In exchange, Wisconsin agreed to give Foxconn at least $3 billion in state tax credits and breaks, according to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, a public-private agency that helped negotiate the package. The deal was much criticized at the time after it emerged that Wisconsin would not make money for 25 years. There are many lessons here, not least about the dangers of the race to the bottom that attracting businesses has become, with every state, county and city offering more and more giveaways in an effort to get a few hundred or a few thousand jobs to move in. But it also tells us something about how misconceived Trump\u2019s view of the economy was when he ran for president and the difficulties he\u2019ll have when he runs for reelection next year. Let\u2019s look at another case, that of a Carrier plant in Indiana where Trump supposedly \u201csaved\u201d 1,100 jobs. In December 2016, he and Mike Pence negotiated with that company another supposedly great deal, this one to stop those jobs from being sent to Mexico where labor is cheaper. Trump announced it triumphantly, as an example of the kind of dealmaking wizardry he would bring to the U.S. economy as a whole. And what happened? Hundreds of workers got laid off anyway. The issue, however, was and is much larger than a factory here and a factory there, even if that might mean everything to the people who work there. The problem is that successful management of the economy, to the extent the president has the power to do it at all, isn\u2019t a matter of picking up the phone in the Oval Office and making a series of \u201cdeals.\u201d First, the economy is obviously way too large for each individual deal to make an impact nationally in a country with a labor force of more than 160 million people. What the president can do is set policy. And what has Trump done? He has certainly let industry run roughshod over environmental, employment and worker safety regulations. Most importantly, he pushed for and signed an enormous tax break for corporations, which was sold on the basis that it would quickly trickle down to workers. But a recent survey of businesses showed only 6 percent of them saying they hired workers because of their windfall; instead, the money went into record stock buybacks to benefit wealthy shareholders. Trump also started a trade war with China that he insisted would lead to an explosion of U.S. exports. We're still waiting, while retaliatory tariffs are hurting American farmers. Oh, and his shutdown cost the economy $11 billion. Nevertheless, unemployment is still low, with job growth continuing on the trajectory set during the Barack Obama years. So that\u2019s something Trump can tout. What he can\u2019t say, however, is that he has addressed the more fundamental problems people feel in their work lives: insecurity, stagnant wages, lack of power on the job, high health insurance costs and more. Anybody may be able to get a job somewhere, but if that job comes with low wages and meager benefits, you won\u2019t exactly be jumping for joy over the economy the president supposedly created for you. Which leads to this question: When Trump comes before the public to ask for another term, what's the story he'll tell about the economy? That his unparalleled dealmaking prowess led to prosperity of a kind the United States has never seen before? That's what he says if you read his Twitter feed, but like much of what he says, it has zero relationship to reality. There is no number of deals Trump can do that will make any real difference to American workers; instead, he has offered the same old Republican economic policies that have been tried and failed so many times before. So in 2020, when he says, \u201cReelect me, and you\u2019ll get so many great deals that America will become a paradise of prosperity,\u201d who\u2019s going to believe him?

And that is the pay gap between the CEO that\u2019s making 21.8 [million] to the 7,000 [dollars] that a worker who has put in 40 hours [a week] gets paid. To me, that just morally does not sit well.\u201d  \u2014 Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), remarks at a congressional hearing, Feb. 7, 2019 Rep. Ilhan Omar is in the news these days for her commentary on congressional supporters of Israel, which Democratic leaders have labeled anti-Semitic. That\u2019s not something we can easily fact check, but even before this controversy erupted, we got a query from a reader about her statement above: \u201cDo McDonald\u2019s workers really only make $7,000 a year? That seems far below the minimum wage.\u201d Let\u2019s check the math. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, though many states have higher minimum wages. Assuming a 40-hour week, that works out to just over $15,000 a year, or more than double $7,000. If you watch the clip above, Omar speaks to a witness, Terrence Wise, a 39-year-old shift manager at a McDonald\u2019s in Independence, Mo., during the House hearing on whether to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. She noted that the chief executive of McDonalds, Steve Easterbrook, earned $21.8 million in 2017. \u201cCan you share with us what someone in your position at McDonald\u2019s gets paid annually?\u201d \u201cNot that much. Not even a fraction of that,\u201d Wise replied. \u201cI make $11 an hour at my job, currently.\u201d Hmmm. An $11 an hour job adds up to $22,880 a year. That\u2019s three times $7,000. So where does Omar get her numbers? A spokesman said that she was referring to an article in Nation\u2019s Restaurant News that relied on a required disclosure in McDonald\u2019s 2018 proxy statement about the \u201cpay ratio\u201d at the company. As a result of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, publicly traded companies must show how the pay of their chief executives compares with the compensation of their median employees. McDonald\u2019s is a global company, so the median figure is for all employees around the world. \u201cThe Company considered all full time, part-time, seasonal and temporary workers employed on such date,\u201d the disclosure said. \u201cOur methodology was straightforward and transparent; we did not exclude employees or make any adjustments to compensation. Using this methodology, 2017 total compensation for our median employee (a part-time restaurant crew employee located in Poland) was $7,017.\u201d But Omar was not talking about part-time workers, let alone one in Poland. She referred to 7,000 [dollars] \u201cfor the worker who has put in 40 hours a day.\u201d (The spokesman said she misspoke, and meant a 40-hour week.) The article in Nation\u2019s Restaurant News did not note that the $7,000 figure was for a part-time worker in Poland. McDonald\u2019s says it pays U.S. workers much more than $7,000 a year. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s starting wage at corporate owned and operated restaurants is above the federal minimum and our average wage for hourly workers is more than $10 per hour, which is why overly general characterizations of the wages we offer can be misleading and inaccurate,\u201d said Lauren Altmin, a spokeswoman at McDonald\u2019s. Assuming at least $10 an hour, that\u2019s $20,800 a year. (About 90 percent of the U.S. restaurants are franchise-owned, but the wage structure is generally similar.) Altmin added that \u201cemployees can earn paid leave, have flexible schedules, and have access to up to $2,500 in prepaid college tuition as well as the ability to enter free high school diploma programs, English as a Second Language classes and education and career advising services through Archways to Opportunity.\u201d Finally, there\u2019s data from Payscale, which provides a bit more granular detail about pay at McDonald\u2019s: an average of $8.31 for a fast-food worker and $10.63 for a restaurant manager. That\u2019s $17,285 and $22,110 a year, respectively. Any way you slice it, Omar\u2019s citation of $7,000 a year is way too low for a U.S. hourly worker at the company. Still, we should note that the pay differential between the McDonald\u2019s chief executive and median worker is huge: 3,101:1. That\u2019s the worst ratio among 17 public restaurant companies \u2014 and the third-worst among public companies. Even if the ratio were adjusted to the average U.S. wage, the pay differential would exceed 1,000:1. Even that is more than three times the 312:1 CEO-to-average-worker ratio in 2017 for the 350 largest firms in the United States, according to an analysis by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. An anonymous survey of 356 companies by Equilar, an executive data company, found the median CEO pay ratio across all submitting companies was 140:1, and the average was 241:1. Easterbrook\u2019s pay was nearly double the next-highest restaurant executive\u2019s pay. The company, in its SEC filing, noted that more than 90 percent of Easterbrook\u2019s pay is \u201cat risk\u201d vs. objective targets and that the company had gained $36 billion in value during 2017 as a result of \u201ca transition from turnaround to growth.\u201d The CEO-to-worker pay ratio was 20:1 in 1965 and 58:1 in 1989, according to EPI, with much of the difference to today\u2019s ratios due to \u201cstock-related components of CEO compensation (stock awards and cashed-in stock options), not by changes in salaries or cash bonuses.\" JUST Capital, a nonprofit that ranks and measures companies according to various criteria important to Americans, puts McDonald\u2019s very low on its list, in the bottom 10 percent of nearly 900 companies. The company does especially poorly on paying its workers a living wage, according to JUST Capital, with only 10 percent of U.S. workers making enough money to cover costs for food, housing and medical care. Omar can point to a document filed with the SEC for her data point and can certainly raise pointed questions about the pay gap at McDonald\u2019s between the chief executive and the typical worker. But her statement lacks context. The $7,000 figure is for a part-time worker in Poland, not a full-time worker in the United States as she suggested. Omar relied on an article that did not make clear the caveat in McDonald\u2019s disclosure. But we always warn politicians (and their staffs) that it is important to check the original source, as news media accounts may be inaccurate or misleading. Omar earns two Pinocchios.

Compared with the Model 3, Tesla\u2019s mass market vehicle, the Model Y will be about 10 percent more expensive, 10 percent bigger, and will have \u201cslightly less range\u201d on a single battery charge, Musk said Sunday on Twitter. A Tesla ordering page says the Model 3 can travel 220 miles on a single charge. Tesla will share detailed specs of the SUV and its pricing March 14 during an event at the company\u2019s design studio in Los Angeles. The Model Y is Tesla\u2019s fifth vehicle, and its second SUV after the Model X. Potential customers and car reviewers will be given the opportunity to take the Model Y out for a spin during the event, Musk said. The announcement comes just days after the company said it would close several U.S. stories and shift vehicle sales online to help keep prices down. The Model 3, America\u2019s best-selling electric car, was first introduced with a $35,000 price tag in 2016 but has been sold since then only at higher prices due to what Musk has called a \u201chellish\u201d series of financial struggles and manufacturing delays.","48":"Rating:     There\u2019s a lot of smoke and mirrors in \u201cThe Hummingbird Project,\u201d a financial thriller that employs the kind of just-plausible-enough dialogue to make you not only think it could happen, but that it did happen. When Vinny Zaleski \u2014 played by Jesse Eisenberg, doing his trademark neurotic shtick \u2014 and his balding, bespectacled computer-whiz cousin, Anton (Alexander Skarsgard, geeked out to the point of unrecognizability), start bandying about terms like \u201cneutrino messaging\u201d and \u201cpulse-shaping microwave towers\u201d in their pursuit of a better way to game the New York Stock Exchange, it will sound, to most listeners, just as comprehensible as any conversation on the bridge of the starship Enterprise. But the fact that Vinny and Anton plan to make a killing in a way that\u2019s been done before, by building a fiber-optic tunnel hundreds of miles long \u2014 thereby shaving off one millisecond in the speed of electronic transactions on the exchange \u2014 grounds the story in a world that feels real-ish, even though the larger-than-life characters that populate it are entirely fictional. It\u2019s a world of ones and zeros in which the battle lines are starkly drawn. On the one side are the Zaleskis, who simultaneously quit their Wall Street day jobs to build that tunnel, courtesy of a rich venture capitalist (Frank Schorpion). On the other side is the cousins\u2019 old boss, Eva Torres (Salma Hayek, in a fun, scenery-chewing turn as an entrepreneur who acts as if she owns her employees). Vinny at one point characterizes the conflict between the two sides as a clash between a modern-day David and Goliath, and in some ways it is. But the way that conflict plays out is also surprisingly plodding. Much of the film revolves around the minutiae of the Zaleskis\u2019 enterprise: negotiating land rights; troubleshooting drilling headaches; and coding, coding, coding (with Anton furiously crunching the numbers in an effort to figure out a way to find that one millisecond). This part of the story is about as interesting as you might expect: watching someone at a computer screen, someone in a hard hat and muddy boots, and someone else arguing with an Amish farmer who doesn\u2019t want a high-speed cable laid under his land. It\u2019s mildly dramatic, but also a little bit drab. To alleviate that, writer-director Kim Nguyen (\u201cWar Witch\u201d), injects some melodrama into the mix: a health scare involving one of the protagonists, along with the threat of legal action by Eva, and her sudden interest in a form of alternate technology that would make the Zaleskis\u2019 plan obsolete. (Cue the microwave towers.) It all feels a bit contrived. More interesting is the question of why Vinny and Anton are doing this in the first place, despite their terrible odds of success. Vinny, at times, seems less motivated by the love of money than by his love for Anton, a kind of childlike savant who dreams of a house in the country with hummingbirds in the yard. (The title also refers to the speed at which a hummingbird beats its wings.) At other times, Vinny seems driven by his hatred of Eva, which isn\u2019t really supported by anything else in the story. In the end, the most intriguing thing about \u201cThe Hummingbird Project\u201d \u2014 and it isn\u2019t all that intriguing, considering how much of it is about cash, not character \u2014 is the realization that the movie isn\u2019t a David-vs.-Goliath tale after all, but one about two Goliaths.

The downbeat finish extended the market\u2019s mild losses from a day earlier. Even so, the benchmark S&P; 500 index is on track to end the month with a gain of more than 3 percent, extending the market\u2019s rebound over the last two months after a steep slide late last year. \u201cThe market has quickly recovered back to the three prior tops that it had within the downturn,\u201d said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager with Globalt Investments. Health care, communications and technology companies took the heaviest losses Wednesday, while financial, industrial and energy stocks notched gains. The market had veered lower early in the day after comments from a key U.S. trade negotiator stoked doubt over how much progress was being made on resolving the trade war between the U.S. and China. The news overshadowed a mix of corporate earnings reports. Weight Watchers plunged to its lowest point in nearly two years after issuing a dismal forecast. Best Buy surged on surprisingly good holiday sales. All told, the S&P; 500 index dropped 1.52 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,792.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 72.82 points, or 0.3 percent, to 25,985.16. The Nasdaq composite gained 5.21 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,554.51. Smaller companies fared better than the broader market. The Russell 2000 index picked up 3.57 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,581.05. Major indexes in Europe declined. Stocks headed broadly lower in early trading Wednesday after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told a panel of lawmakers that \u201cmuch still needs to be done\u201d before the U.S. and China can reach an agreement. China has offered to make major purchases of U.S. goods, such as soybeans and natural gas, in a bid to resolve the conflict, but Lighthizer said such steps wouldn\u2019t be enough. \u201cThe issues on the table are too serious to be resolved with promises of additional purchases,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need new rules.\u201d Lighthizer\u2019s comments are \u201ccreating market nervousness\u201d, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. Negotiations between Washington and Beijing continue under the threat of additional tariffs on Chinese goods that could escalate the conflict and make products even more costly for consumers and companies. President Donald Trump has postponed increasing tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods that would have been effective March 2. He has not given a new date for the higher tariffs if negotiations falter. The main sticking point for the U.S. centers on ending cyber theft of commercial secrets, limits on state support for Chinese companies, and an end to the forced transfer of technology. Investors continued to size up the latest batch of corporate earnings reports. Weight Watchers plunged 34.5 percent after the weight-loss program operator gave investors a surprisingly weak forecast. The company did not sign up as many subscribers as it hoped this winter and expects its profits to suffer. CEO Mindy Grossman said the company hopes to pull in more subscribers this spring, with high-profile investor Oprah Winfrey playing a central role in its upcoming TV and digital marketing campaign. Dean Foods slid 13.8 percent after the food and beverage company reported a wider-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter and suspended its dividend. Best Buy notched the biggest gain in the S&P; 500, vaulting 14.1 percent after reporting that its holiday sales bucked a downward trend for retailers. The electronics retailer\u2019s profit beat forecasts, but more importantly a key retail sales measure continued growing during a tough quarter for the industry. The company also raised its quarterly dividend by 11 percent and its board of directors approved a $3 billion stock buyback program. Other retailers also rose. Nordstrom added 3.7 percent, while Kohl\u2019s gained 2.5 percent. Palo Alto Networks climbed 8.2 percent after the cybersecurity company\u2019s fiscal profit surged past analysts\u2019 forecasts. The company also announced a $1 billion stock buyback program. Energy stocks finished higher, helped by rising oil prices. Concho Resources added 2.7 percent. U.S. crude climbed 2.6 percent to settle at $56.94 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 1.8 percent to close at $66.39 a barrel in London. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.69 percent from 2.63 percent late Tuesday. The dollar declined to 110.04 yen from 110.51 yen on Tuesday. The euro weakened to $1.1370 from $1.1395. Gold fell 0.5 percent to $1,321.20 an ounce. Silver dropped 1 percent to $15.77 an ounce. Copper rose 0.4 percent to $2.96 a pound. In other energy futures trading, wholesale gasoline jumped 3 percent to $1.63 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1.2 percent to $2.02 a gallon. Natural gas gained 0.1 percent to $2.80 per 1,000 cubic feet.","50":"The House Judiciary Committee plans to question the point person for the controversial 2016 Trump Tower Moscow project in what will be Democrats\u2019 second session next week with the onetime business associate of President Trump.\u00a0 The panel, which has impeachment jurisdiction, will conduct a closed-door interview on Thursday with Felix Sater, a real estate developer and entrepreneur who once worked with Trump, according to two officials familiar with the session who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss the committee\u2019s plans.\u00a0 Sater, a U.S. citizen who was born in Russia, is to appear publicly before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday. Investigators on both panels are expected to question Sater on Trump\u2019s plans to build a skyscraper in Moscow during the 2016 election, a project Sater worked on for a time. It was Sater who came up with the idea of giving a $50\u00a0million penthouse in that building to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a way to market the tower to wealthy individuals. Originally, longtime Trump attorney Michael Cohen testified that work on that proposed development ended in January 2016, well before Trump became the GOP nominee for president. However, text messages subsequently turned over by Sater showed that discussions about the project continued into the middle of that election year.\u00a0 Cohen eventually said\u00a0he had initially lied to congressional investigators about the project, which has become a top focus for House Democrats. While both the Judiciary and Intelligence committees are investigating Trump, the Intelligence Committee has focused on what Trump associates may have known about Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. The Judiciary Committee is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice, abused his power or engaged in public corruption. In that vein, the panels\u2019 questions are likely to differ slightly, with the Intelligence Committee focused on Russia and the Judiciary Committee asking about possible obstruction. Sater, for example, could be asked about whether he was ever instructed to lie or mislead to protect Trump regarding the timing of the 2016 Trump Tower Moscow talks. In early March, the Judiciary Committee asked Sater for any documents related to Trump Tower Moscow as well as to foreign governments participating in or being solicited for business transactions with Trump, his company, his children\u2019s companies or the presidential inaugural committee.\u00a0 It also sought any correspondence about loans or capital investments by any Russian entity with the Trump Organization or any of the family\u2019s businesses after Jan. 1, 2015. The panel, a Democratic committee official said, will ask Sater about all of those items. Sater has been sought as a witness by congressional and Justice Department investigators because of his years of work with Trump on a range of developments beyond the Trump Tower in Moscow.\u00a0 Sater, who came to the United States from Russia at age 6, helped lead a company, Bayrock, that partnered with Trump on the Trump SoHo Hotel in New York, which opened in 2010. The two men also discussed working jointly on other Trump-branded developments, including a hotel and condominium project that was built in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and others proposed around the world. Trump has since distanced himself from Sater. The businessman was convicted in 1991 in connection with a bar fight and charged again in 1998 for his role in an organized-crime scheme to manipulate stock prices.\u00a0Sater pleaded guilty but received no jail time, because of his cooperation with law enforcement investigating organized crime.","51":"D.C. Council member Jack Evans has repeatedly emailed business proposals to law firms that lobby District officials, offering his connections and influence amassed as the city\u2019s longest-serving lawmaker. In a January 2018 pitch to Nelson Mullins, a law firm that had lobbied his office on behalf of a client just months before, Evans said the firm should employ him because as an elected official and chairman of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, he could engage in \u201ccross-marketing my relationships and influence to Nelson Mullins clients.\u201d Using her government email account, Evans\u2019s chief of staff sent similar proposals on his behalf in 2015 to the firms Venable and K&L; Gates, as well as to Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, which hired him. Evans, a Democrat representing Ward 2, and his chief of staff, Schannette Grant, did not respond to requests for comment. The pitches \u2014 obtained by The Washington Post through a Freedom of Information Act request \u2014 show how one of the District\u2019s most powerful public officials sought simultaneously to work in the private sector on behalf of companies looking to navigate the landscape of local government. And the proposals come to light as federal prosecutors are scrutinizing Evans\u2019s business affairs. In September, a federal grand jury issued a subpoena to D.C. officials for documents relating to legislation Evans promoted in 2016 that would have benefited a digital-sign company, Digi Outdoor Media. Evans had received and has said he returned money and stock from the company. \u201cWhile I would not be able to directly lobby the District government, I could certainly use my knowledge of local government to strategize with someone looking to do business locally,\u201d Evans said in the 2015 pitch. D.C. law permits elected officials to hold jobs in the private sector. But of the 13 members of the D.C. Council, just one other, Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), reports significant and continuing outside income on required financial disclosures. Cheh is a constitutional-law professor at George Washington University. Throughout his 28-year tenure on the council, Evans has engaged in outside legal and consulting work. In required disclosures, he has listed law firms for which he has worked but has not named his clients. D.C. ethics rules require him to identify clients only if they have contracts with the District or stand to benefit from pending legislation. As chair of the committee on finance and revenue, Evans has significant sway over the city\u2019s tax policy, finances and tourism industry. As chairman of WMATA, Evans oversees contracting and policy for a regional transit agency with a $3\u00a0billion budget. From 2001 to 2015, Evans worked at the powerhouse law and lobby firm Patton Boggs, where his focus included \u201cgovernment and Congressional relations, business law and corporate securities,\u201d according to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He has said he earned $190,000 per year from the firm in outside income. He earns $140,161 annually as a D.C. Council member. Evans sent his 2018 proposal to Nelson Mullins lawyer Timothy Fitzgibbon, who did not respond to a request for comment. There is no indication that the firm hired or retained Evans. In the pitch, Evans remarked that the District\u2019s government \u201cis the flattest political organization in the country.\u201d \u201cThere are just 15 elected officials in the city: one mayor, 13 councilmembers, and one attorney general,\u201d Evans wrote. \u201cA contract, bill, or regulation can go from idea to consummation in a matter of months.\u201d Evans continued: \u201cDespite this fertile ground, no local firm has yet to establish itself as the \u2018Go-To\u2019 government relations firm. The opportunity to claim this mantle is clear.\u201d Among the recipients of Evans\u2019s 2015 pitch was John Ray, a former council member and a partner at Manatt. Ray or an associate had lobbied Evans on behalf of energy giant Exelon only months earlier. Ray did not respond a request for comment. That proposal included the District of Columbia in a list of potential clients Evans said he could help attract. The list also included businesses with which he had dealt as a council member, among them Xerox, Uber, Fort Myer Construction and the hotel company Marriott. \u201cI am looking to continue my law practice while continuing to serve on the City Council,\u201d Evans wrote. Evans began working for Manatt in October 2015. That month, his signature was first among those of seven council members who, under D.C. Council letterhead, urged the Public Service Commission to approve a merger between Exelon and Pepco. The letter did not disclose a relationship between Evans and Exelon\u2019s lobbying firm. A spokeswoman for Exelon declined to comment Friday. Evans was reelected to his latest four-year term in 2016. He stopped working at Manatt in October 2017, according to his financial disclosures. By that time, he had created his own firm, NSE Consulting, which was named in the grand jury subpoena in September seeking information relating to Evans and the digital-sign company.","52":"TURIN, Italy \u2014 If you can\u2019t beat him, buy him. The $131 million that Juventus spent to lure Cristiano Ronaldo away from Real Madrid is already paying off on the field and off it. Ronaldo scored a hat trick against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday, giving the Italian team the three goals it needed to overturn a 2-0 loss from the first leg. The win earned Juventus a spot in the quarterfinals, worth at least 16 million euros ($18 million) from UEFA and ticket sales. \u201cThat\u2019s why Juventus signed me,\u201d said Ronaldo, who has scored 24 goals this season. \u201cI do my job and I\u2019m very happy. It\u2019s been a magical night.\u201d The Portugal forward was brought in to help Juventus finally win the Champions League again after some tough losses to Real Madrid, a team at the time led by none other than Ronaldo. His goals against his old team on Tuesday have already proved historic. The result led Juventus back from a two-goal loss in the first leg for the first time in club history. The victory also helped boost Juventus\u2019 share price on Wednesday morning. The rise was so sharp that trading on it had to be temporarily halted after opening on the Italian Stock Exchange with a 23 percent increase on Tuesday\u2019s closing price. That same stock market had taken a hit three weeks ago, with the club\u2019s share price dropping more than 9 percent after its 2-0 loss in Madrid. Juventus\u2019 presence in the quarterfinals and the manner in which it qualified will also boost its coffers in a way that is hard to quantify: Brand improvement. That is something Juventus has been working on for several years and which included the changing of the club logo and the signing of Ronaldo, which increased its following on social media by tens of millions. This season, Juventus has already received 94 million euros ($106 million) from UEFA and that could rise to almost 130 million ($147 million) if the Italian team wins its third European Cup \u2014 and first since 1996. That figure doesn\u2019t include ticket sales. Juventus made a record 5.5 million euros ($6.2 million) on Tuesday from gate receipts, including hospitality. That beat the previous mark of 5 million euros ($5.7 million) from its 2-1 loss to Manchester United earlier in the season. And that will likely be surpassed no matter which team comes to the Allianz Stadium for the quarterfinals. Ronaldo hasn\u2019t had the easiest time off the field after being accused of rape in the United States, but his influence on the field cannot be overestimated. Just look at Real Madrid, which had won the last three Champions League titles with Ronaldo but couldn\u2019t even reach the quarterfinals this year without him. ___","53":"MADISON, Wis. \u2014 Two of Maryland\u2019s most important players \u2014 Bruno Fernando and Jalen Smith \u2014 went to the bench with foul trouble early in the second half. But that\u2019s not when the Terrapins let the game spiral into Wisconsin\u2019s favor. Their two big men were back on the floor \u2014 with three fouls each \u2014 during the crucial stretch late in the second half when the Badgers took off on a 12-1 run. The run started with just under five minutes remaining and Maryland up by one. By the time it ended, Wisconsin had turned a close game into a double-digit lead en route to a 69-61 win, ending Maryland\u2019s bid for its first road victory over a ranked team under Mark Turgeon. No. 21 Maryland (17-6, 8-4 Big Ten) made just three of its eight shots over the final five minutes. Two of those came after the Badgers had effectively sealed the game. No. 24 Wisconsin (16-6, 8-3) made four straight field goals \u2014 including a pair of three-pointers from Aleem Ford \u2014 during those closing minutes. \u201cAs a team, they got hot,\u201d Fernando said. \u201cWhen the team is playing with a home crowd, you can never allow them to get hot.\u201d The Badgers retook the lead for the first time since early in the game with a little more than six minutes remaining. Then, right before the official under-four minute timeout, Ford hit a three-pointer, Ethan Happ made a layup to extend Wisconsin\u2019s lead to four, and Maryland\u2019s collapse had begun. When these two teams played earlier in the season, the Terps also struggled late, nearly allowing a 21-point lead to go to waste in College Park. But Anthony Cowan Jr. hit a late three to help seal the win for Maryland that night. Since losing to Maryland, Wisconsin has won five straight, with all except Friday\u2019s by double digits, including a 64-54 win over then-undefeated Michigan on Jan. 19. \u201cThey just made a lot of tough shots,\u201d freshman Eric Ayala said of Friday\u2019s game. \u201cIt kind of reminded me of last game. But we pulled away last game.\u201d Just after a timeout with 7:34 to go in the second half, Wisconsin\u2019s Brad Davidson hit a three-pointer to cut Maryland\u2019s lead to one. Ayala called that play a \u201cmomentum-changer for them.\u201d Out of desperation, Maryland tried playing zone defense in the second half, but the Terps made mistakes \u2014 Ayala said the team hasn\u2019t practiced zone defense much \u2014 and Wisconsin continued to make shots. For the Terps, this game marked the start of a five-game stretch that includes four road contests. Before Friday\u2019s game, Maryland had played three of the past four away from Xfinity Center. Ayala started the game hot, hitting his first five shots, three of which came from beyond the arc. By halftime, the freshman had a team-high 13 points \u2014 more than he scored by the end of each of the team\u2019s last five games. Later, in the second half, Ayala ended Wisconsin\u2019s 7-0 run and Maryland\u2019s four-minute scoring drought with a three. Ayala finished the game with 18 points, his second highest total of the season. Maryland finished the night just 3-for-8 from the foul line, but what stuck out to Turgeon was how his team only attempted eight free throws, while the Badgers had 23 tries. Happ recorded a triple-double against Northwestern (13 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists) a week ago, and against the Terps he had 18 points, 11 rebounds and six assists. Both Happ and Fernando did not have substantial roles in the teams' January matchup, thanks to foul trouble. But on Friday, Happ avoided foul trouble while Maryland\u2019s bigs could not. \u201cThey\u2019re really hard to guard,\u201d Turgeon said. \u201cWhen Happ\u2019s playing like that, they\u2019re really hard.\u201d And during stretches in the second half, Maryland had to try to guard Happ without their best big men. Fernando (13 points) picked up his third foul less than three minutes into the second half. Six seconds later, Smith (five points) committed his third foul, sending the Terps\u2019 two best big men to the bench when Maryland had a three-point lead, which Wisconsin trimmed to one when Happ made both of his free throws. Turgeon said before the game that keeping Fernando out of foul trouble against the Badgers was a priority. Wisconsin forward Nate Reuvers, who scored 18 points when his team played Maryland earlier in the year, fouled out with 3:25 remaining after a scoreless night. This week, Turgeon called the January game against Wisconsin \u201cprobably our best win\u201d of the season. It\u2019s Maryland\u2019s only win this season against a team currently ranked in the top 25. (Wins over Indiana and Nebraska came when those teams were ranked, but both have since fallen out of the top 25.) Maryland went to the locker room up five but lacking momentum \u2014 the Badgers' Brevin Pritzl made a three at the buzzer to trim Wisconsin\u2019s margin to 36-31 at intermission. Ayala turned the ball over with 15 seconds left in the half, which he said was the more critical mistake. Maryland didn\u2019t score in the final three minutes of the first half. Wisconsin then scored to open the second half and had tied the game by the 16:11 mark. \u201cWe played our tails off,\u201d Turgeon said. \u201cWe\u2019re young. I hate losing and it stinks. My kids battled. ... We just weren\u2019t good enough in the end.\u201d Read More on the Maryland Terrapins: Maryland lacrosse gets scoring push from players who felt the pull of football Kaila Charles leads Maryland to a home rout of Wisconsin Maryland football probe cost $1.57 million.

By the end of the week, more than 87 million people in those regions will experience temperatures at or below zero degrees and wind chills far colder. A portion of the polar vortex, the pool of subfreezing air that normally swirls over the Arctic Circle, dives into the Midwest this week, pushing temperatures off a cliff. The most intense cold will last from Tuesday night through Thursday across a broad region from North Dakota south into Missouri and as far east as Upstate New York. Temperatures are forecast to run as much as 50 degrees below average for late January. Some forecasts Monday were calling for temperatures to drop to minus-29 in Chicago, two degrees below its lowest temperature on record, set on Jan. 20, 1985. Even if the record is not broken, the National Weather Service in Chicago is calling this week\u2019s forecast \u201clife-threatening extreme cold\u201d that \u201ccan lead to rapid onset of frostbite and hypothermia.\u201d The wind chill will plunge to minus-30 to minus-40 as far south as Illinois and northern Indiana. The wind chill temperature, which is a measure of what the air fees like when wind is taken into account, will fall as low as minus-65 in the Upper Midwest. A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that cold weather is responsible for the majority of weather-related fatalities. The wind chill temperature is more than a catchy forecast term. The wind blows away the insulating layer of warm air around us generated naturally by our bodies. Wind chill attempts to quantify the effect in terms of how it feels on our skin, which is why you\u2019ll sometimes hear it called the \u201cfeels like\u201d temperature. A wind chill of minus-20 degrees can cause frostbite in as little as 30 minutes. The cold air is riding behind an Arctic front that brought several inches of snow to the same region over the weekend. The pure white ground will enhance the chill, as sunlight reflects off the snow and back to space instead of being absorbed into the ground where it could warm things up. In Des Moines, where the wind chill may dip to minus-40 on Wednesday, the National Weather Service advised home and business owners to make sure they are ready for the impending cold snap. \u201cMake sure your heating system, pipes, etc. are as well-prepared as possible,\u201d it advised. \u201cIt may be wise to stock up on groceries between now and Monday evening so outdoor time is minimized.\u201d There\u2019s no arguing the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area is winter-hardy and has endured many polar vortex visitations before. The Twin Cities Weather Service office, where the wind chill is expected to plunge to minus-50, pulled out the real talk on Sunday. \"There\u2019s no sugarcoating it, the weather will get extremely cold,\u201d it tweeted. On top of temperatures that will make you want to never leave the house, wind gusts up to 35 mph over fresh snow could cause periodic whiteout conditions on the roads. The National Weather Service in Chicago says the temperatures in its forecasts are the coldest in 25 years for the region. Dozens of cities have forecasts at least within one degree of record cold temperatures, including Chicago, Des Moines, Cleveland, Detroit and Minneapolis. The maps below show forecast high temperatures Wednesday afternoon and low temperatures early Thursday morning. The temperatures circled are within one degree of the current record at that location. Grand Forks, N.D. \u2014 Minus-57 Minneapolis \u2014 Minus-50 Milwaukee \u2014 Minus-45 Chicago \u2014 Minus-45 St. Louis \u2014 Minus-20 Detroit \u2014 Minus-35 Cleveland \u2014 Minus-32 Pittsburgh \u2014 Minus-20 Syracuse, N.Y. \u2014 Minus-20","55":"Twice on Thursday, President Trump made comments that conveyed a remarkable lack of familiarity with basic aspects of the American economy. It began with remarks he made to reporters during an event in the Oval Office. \u201cYou mentioned all the economic indicators are going up,\u201d a reporter asked. \u201cWhy, then, is the \u2014 are U.S. deficits and the financial debt increasing at a time when the economy \u2014\u201d Trump jumped in. \u201cWell, the trade deals won\u2019t kick in for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, number one, the USMCA\u201d \u2014 the revised version of NAFTA that Trump\u2019s administration negotiated with Canada and Mexico \u2014 \u201chasn\u2019t even been approved yet. It has to go before Congress and get approved. Now, it should get approved quickly.\u201d Before NAFTA, Trump said, \u201cwe had huge surpluses with Mexico. With NAFTA, we have huge deficits. We lose $100 billion a year on trade with Mexico. Does that sound good? And this has been going on for many years. So I stopped it. I stopped it a lot.\u201d You probably noticed that Trump took a question that\u2019s obviously about the federal budget deficit and gave an answer that dealt with the country\u2019s trade deficits. Both are deficits, sure, but they relate to each other in about the same way that a tuning fork relates to a dinner fork. The term \u201cdeficit\u201d describes something similar in each case, and they can even share similar properties, but the two are by no means equal. If the entirety of trade between the United States and Mexico was your buying a $20,000 car from Mexico and selling someone there a $99 piece of software, the United States would have exported far less in goods than it imported, to the tune of $19,901. If, the next year, you sold another $99 software package but purchased only one $3 avocado, suddenly the United States would be running a trade surplus \u2014 $96 worth. That\u2019s a change of nearly $20,000 in only one year! None of this money, though, affects what the government is doing. Your car or that avocado doesn\u2019t go into the U.S. Treasury as a tax receipt. We could chalk this up to Trump mishearing the question were it not for the interview he gave to the New York Times a few hours later. Trump was asked if the tariffs he had imposed on China might remain in effect indefinitely even if the United States and China reached a broader trade agreement, as Trump hoped. \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cWe have 25 percent now on $50 billion. And by the way . . . that\u2019s a lot of money pouring into our Treasury, you know. We never made 5 cents with China. We\u2019re getting, right now, 25 percent on $50 billion. And then I was putting 25 percent at a later date, which date came and went \u2014 25 percent or $200 billion.\u201d Now, it is true that tariffs can generate revenue for the government. In 2017, the U.S. government generated $34.9 billion in \u201ccustoms duties,\u201d taxes paid on the import of products into the country. That made up just under 1 percent of all of the taxes collected that year. (The bulk came from income taxes.) If you\u2019re curious, assuming that the U.S. government collected 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese products, that would be another $12.5 billion in revenue, but that\u2019s probably not a fair assumption. The percentage of revenue that would constitute is about 1.3 percent. But, as The Washington Post\u2019s Heather Long pointed out when Trump suggested in August that tariffs would pay down the debt, it\u2019s not the Chinese paying those tariffs \u2014 it\u2019s the person or company doing the importing. In our example above, Trump slapping a 25 percent tariff on cars from Mexico would mean that you\u2019d have to pay $5,000 to the government for your $20,000 Mexican car. No wonder you stuck to that avocado in year two. Put another way: The income the country is earning from those tariffs could more directly be generated by just raising taxes. Instead, Trump cut taxes \u2014 resulting in a plunge in corporate tax payments and a surge in the deficit that then drove the debt higher. Which is why that reporter asked about deficits and the debt in the Oval Office. All of this is admittedly better than the really bizarre comment Trump made during an interview with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity in October 2017. Hannity tossed up a softball about the economy, and Trump took a swing. \u201cThe country \u2014 we took it over and owed over $20 trillion,\u201d Trump said, referring to the national debt. \u201cAs you know, the last eight years, they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country. So they borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet we picked up $5.2 trillion just in the stock market. Possibly picked up the whole thing in terms of the first nine months, in terms of value. So you could say, in one sense, we\u2019re really increasing values. And maybe, in a sense, we\u2019re reducing debt.\u201d There is no sense in which rising stock market valuations reduces the federal debt. The way the federal debt is reduced is either by cutting federal spending or increasing federal revenue, including through raising taxes. As president, Trump has made overtures at the former and rejected the latter, meaning that the nearly $20 trillion debt Trump inherited has now topped $21.5 trillion. But, then, the trade deals won\u2019t kick in for a while.","56":"With James Hohmann THE BIG IDEA: The deafening chorus demanding Ralph Northam\u2019s resignation suggests that Americans could be on the precipice of a #MeToo moment for racial politics. Virginia\u2019s Democratic governor met Sunday night with his senior staff to weigh his options \u2014\u00a0including resignation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and gauge support from within his own administration. Many of Northam\u2019s longtime friends and erstwhile allies, including African American leaders and four of his Democratic predecessors as governor, dismissed his pleas for patience and called on him to step aside over a racist photo on his 1984 medical school yearbook page. The speed and intensity with which they did so reflects some of the ways that the political culture, nationally and in the South specifically, is changing. -- Northam is the latest in a string of politicians whose careers have been jeopardized recently by accusations of racism. Republican Michael Ertel resigned late last month as Florida\u2019s secretary of state after photos emerged of him in blackface, appearing to mock Hurricane Katrina victims. Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who won bipartisan plaudits for appointing him, accepted Ertel\u2019s resignation two hours after the local Tallahassee newspaper presented the 2005 pictures to his office. \u201cI don't want to get mired into kind of side controversies, and so I felt it was best to just accept the resignation and move on,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cIt's unfortunate. I think he's done a lot of good work.\u201d Amid the Northam fallout, Ertel wrote a statement Sunday on his personal Facebook page apologizing for the offensive Halloween costume. \u201cI\u2019m a better man than I was 14 years ago,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYet, over the past week, I have been rightfully apologizing for something I did Halloween night, 2005.\u201d -- Ertel\u2019s resignation came less than two weeks after House Republican leaders moved to strip Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) of his committee assignments over his comments about white nationalism and white supremacy. \u201cThat is not the party of Lincoln,\u201d said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). \u201cIt is definitely not American. All people are created equal in America, and we want to take a very strong stance about that.\u201d King\u2019s comments were far from his first offense. In 2006, King described the murders of Americans at the hands of undocumented immigrants as \u201ca slow-motion Holocaust.\u201d The same year, he proposed building a concrete border wall with an electrified wire across the top to disincentivize trying to cross into the United States. \u201cWe do that with livestock all the time,\u201d King said. And in 2013, he explained his opposition to providing legal status to \u201cdreamers\u201d by saying, \u201cFor everyone who\u2019s a valedictorian, there\u2019s another 100 out there that weigh 130 pounds and they\u2019ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\u201d In response to the drug mule comments, then-Speaker John Boehner said King\u2019s remarks did not \u201creflect the values of the American people or the Republican Party.\u201d But he never punished King in any meaningful way. As recently as last year, when King retweeted a Nazi sympathizer, Republican leadership was largely silent. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to the point with Congressman King that many people almost expect this sort of behavior out of him,\u201d Iowa GOP strategist Nick Ryan, a frequent King critic, said at the time. \u201cSo when he does something that\u2019s inappropriate or outlandish, many people in leadership have chosen to turn their heads the other way, because they don\u2019t know how else to deal with him.\u201d In short, King\u2019s behavior didn\u2019t change. But the reaction to it did. Much like the #MeToo movement, past actions are being viewed through a new lens. The public outcry, combined with his narrow reelection last year, altered the political calculus of those who had defended him. -- Previously unknown actions are also rising to the surface. Stephen J. Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said the Northam controversy may trigger more revelations of racial misconduct, the same way that the #MeToo movement emboldened women to come forward after years of silence. \u201cOther politicians who have similar controversies in their past have to be prepared for them to be disclosed,\u201d Farnsworth said. \u201cAnd there may be additional pressure on Virginia government to deal with legacies of the Confederacy and Jim Crow in terms of statues and renaming of public parks.\u201d -- Mo Elleithee, a Democratic strategist with experience in Virginia politics, expressed hope that the Northam controversy and others like it will clear the way for more public reflection on racial misconduct. \u201cThere are a lot of subtle and not-so-subtle racial insensitivities that people don\u2019t notice or ignore or laugh off,\u201d Elleithee said. \u201cThere is some reason to be hopeful that all of these unfortunate incidents are hopefully beginning to make way for some positive takeaways.\u201d Elleithee, now the executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, added that Northam\u2019s fumbling response to the allegations could prove to be a teaching moment for those who may later face the same kind of accusations. \u201cIf others find themselves in similar situations, I think the pressure will continue to grow, but it\u2019s an opportunity for them to show their own possible redemption,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that this is an awakening moment for a lot of people who \u2026 now can see that that\u2019s not actually funny and [how] those who were oppressed by the Klan react when they see people in positions of power who were so cavalier about it once.\u201d -- There is a possibility that these are isolated incidents. After all, DeSantis may have fired his secretary of state for a blackface photo, but he himself was elected governor after saying on Fox News that Floridians would \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by voting for his black opponent, Andrew Gillum. The comment was widely criticized as racial dog-whistling and prompted a formal rebuke from Fox News. While she was campaigning for Mississippi\u2019s Senate seat, Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith attracted national attention after she was recorded on video joking, \u201cIf he invited me to a public hanging, I\u2019d be on the front row.\u201d She called the remark an \u201cexaggerated expression of regard\u201d and awkwardly apologized to anyone who was \u201coffended.\u201d It was also discovered that Hyde-Smith attended high school at a segregation academy and appeared in a yearbook photo that showed a mascot holding a Confederate flag and wearing a costume imitating the uniform of a Confederate general. Hyde-Smith went on to defeat Democrat Mike Espy, who would have become the state\u2019s first African American senator since Reconstruction, by eight points. -- Just as Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory helped ignite the #MeToo movement on sexual misconduct, his presidency has also helped to unleash an awakening on race. Experts will debate forever how much of a factor it was, but it strains credulity that the election of Trump \u2014 who spent years falsely insisting Barack Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States \u2014 had nothing at all to do with a white backlash to the first black president. Trump, of course, has generated several race-related controversies since taking office. Most notoriously, he faced intense blowback for suggesting that \u201cboth sides\u201d were to blame for the August 2017 violence in Charlottesville, where neo-Nazi sympathizers clashed with anti-racist demonstrators. -- The Northam news broke hours after Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) announced his candidacy to become the country\u2019s second black president \u2014 at the start of Black History Month. \u201cBut the near-simultaneous reminders of the country\u2019s ugly past on race and the prospects for a more inclusive future were not just a matter of happenstance: it reflected the duality of American politics in the Trump era,\u201d Jonathan Martin observes on the front page of today\u2019s New York Times. \u201cIf President Trump\u2019s election amounted to an angry rejoinder to America\u2019s first black president, as many on the left believe, Mr. Trump has created a backlash of his own, energizing women and people of color who represent an unmistakable rebuke to his demagogy on race and ethnicity and his misogynistic attacks. \u2026 What Mr. Trump may have done, though, is open the eyes of moderate and more liberal whites about the country\u2019s lingering racial and gender inequities and \u2014 whether out of guilt, anger, embarrassment or some combination \u2014 prompted them to take out their discontent on Republicans.\u201d -- But Trump may be the exception that proves the rule \u2014 as he has been with the #MeToo movement. After all, Trump managed to win election even after several women accused him of sexual misconduct and the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape emerged. Yet a year after the allegations against Harvey Weinstein were first reported, the New York Times estimated that similar accusations had forced at least 200 prominent men to leave their positions. Nearly half of those men\u2019s replacements were women. If Northam leaves office, he will be replaced by Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D), who is black. When he was sworn in as lieutenant governor last year, Fairfax kept in his pocket the document that freed his great-great-great-grandfather from slavery. -- A sea change on the left: \u201cBy the end of the day Saturday, nearly the entire 2020 Democratic field had called on Northam to resign,\u201d Felicia Sonmez notes. \u201cSome, including [Booker], emphasized the long history of racial discrimination in America, noting that the images \u2018arouse centuries of anger, anguish and racist violence.\u2019 Others \u2014 including former HUD secretary and San Antonio mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) \u2014 stressed the importance of calling out racism regardless of political party. \u2026 \u201cThe vocal and lightning-quick responses come as the Democrats are fielding the most diverse presidential field ever. Their voters, too, are less likely to be white than Republicans' are, a trend that already led to a Democratic House caucus with more women and people of color being voted in last year. And with 87 percent of Democrats believing that President Trump is doing a poor or not so good job handling race relations, according to the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, the issue is certain to be inescapable in the 2020 presidential race. The Post-ABC News poll, released before the Northam controversy erupted, shows that 18 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning respondents rank reducing racial and gender discrimination as the most important priority in the United States. That puts it third, behind improving the health-care system (31 percent) and reducing economic inequality (21 percent). It ranked even higher with nonwhite Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, with 23 percent putting it No. 1.\u201d \u201cNo one can afford to be on the wrong side of this issue,\u201d said Democratic strategist Symone Sanders, a senior adviser at Priorities USA. \u201cIn 2019, folks cannot afford to waver when it comes to condemning xenophobia, racism, sexism, on down the line.\u201d Former governor Terry McAuliffe (D), under whom Northam served as lieutenant governor, said he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d when he saw the photo and added that it\u2019s irrelevant if Northam\u2019s insistence that he\u2019s not in the picture turns out to be correct. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether he was in the photo or not in the photo at this point,\u201d McAuliffe said on CNN. \u201cWe have to close that chapter.\u201d -- \u201cWhat we have learned over the last 24 hours along with all the incidents of the last two years brings front and center the need for this nation to deal with the question of race once and for all,\u201d said NAACP President Derrick Johnson. \u201cBecause we have Trump in the White House, who has created a political landscape of intolerance and racial hatred, this has exposed a wound that has been festering for a while now,\u201d Johnson told the Associated Press on Saturday. \u201cIf we cannot recognize African-Americans are full citizens entitled to humane treatment by our public policy makers, how can we expect public policy to meet the needs and interests of those communities being portrayed as less than human?\u201d Ralph Northam and Justin Fairfax greet supporters at an election night rally in 2017. (Win McNamee\/Getty Images) MORE NORTHAM FALLOUT: -- People familiar with last night\u2019s staff meeting say the governor has not reached a decision about what to do, Greg Schneider, Laura Vozzella and Jenna Portnoy report from Richmond: \u201cIt was unclear who was present, but the group included senior staffers of color. ... Although he pledged on Saturday to stand his ground, he also said he would reconsider if he thought he could no longer be effective. ... The meeting was emotional, according to a Democratic official. Northam scheduled a larger meeting for Monday morning for administration staff. \u2026 \u201cBefore the meeting, Northam spent much of the day in seclusion at his family home on the Eastern Shore as confidants delivered conflicting advice about whether he should resign or continue fighting to clear his name \u2026 At least one senior staffer and one Cabinet member have reached out to private firms about job possibilities, according to a person who was approached by the two. One of those urging Northam to stay and defend his honor is first lady Pam Northam. \u2026 \u201cFairfax, who had begun making preparations to take over as governor on Saturday when it seemed as though Northam might resign, spent Sunday with his family in Northern Virginia and returned to Richmond in the evening.\u201d -- Democratic leaders fear the Northam controversy will continue to drag down the party\u2019s message on race-related issues until he resigns. Sean Sullivan and Chelsea Janes report: \u201cThe presidential hopefuls are openly campaigning against Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric and hard-line border policies as well as on issues such as stopping police violence against African Americans, all of which have opened wide partisan and cultural divides during Trump\u2019s tenure. \u2026 [Democrats] argued that their swift and widespread calls for Northam to step down stand in contrast with the way Republicans have handled recent racial controversies in their own ranks. \u2026 But a Democratic member of Congress \u2026 said the Northam revelation may potentially undercut the contrast Democrats are seeking in their messaging if he remains in office.\u201d -- Many African American Virginians who supported Northam in 2017 said they felt betrayed after seeing the photo. Laura Meckler reports: \u201cIn conversations at churches, salons and coffee shops, African Americans disagreed about whether Northam must resign, but all voiced a sense of betrayal. In public office, Northam worked to expand Medicaid, the health program that serves the poor, and he helped to restore voting rights for felons, a policy that helps many black men. Many in the black community saw him as an ally, and as one of the good guys.\u201d -- The editor in chief of the website Big League Politics said\u00a0he uncovered the story thanks to a tip from a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d who was outraged about comments Northam made last week about late-term abortion. Paul Farhi reports: Patrick\u00a0Howley \u201cdeclined to give any further information about his source, citing a confidentiality agreement. But he said it took him just a few hours to confirm that the photo was authentic. The source of the tip appears to have been a medical school classmate or classmates of Northam who acted as a direct result of the abortion controversy that erupted earlier in the week, according to two people at Big League Politics.\" WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: New England Patriots' Julian Edelman, left, and Tom Brady celebrate after their Super Bowl victory over\u00a0the Los Angeles Rams in Atlanta. (David J. Phillip\/AP) -- The Patriots defeated the Rams 13-3 to win their sixth Super Bowl title, tying the Pittsburgh Steelers for the franchise record. Mark Maske reports: \u201cThe New England Patriots were short on all-around brilliance on this night. The customary near-perfection of quarterback Tom Brady was missing. But the Patriots dug in and put their true grit and uncommon resourcefulness on display instead. They demonstrated their unmatched ability to do whatever is needed and to be just good enough to prevail. All of that translated into yet another Lombardi Trophy on Sunday, as they outlasted the Los Angeles Rams ... in a far-from-elegant Super Bowl LIII at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. \u2026 The Patriots secured their sixth Super Bowl triumph in their ninth appearance in the big game with Brady as their quarterback and Bill Belichick as their coach.

(Brendan Smialowski\/AFP\/Getty Images) WEST WING INTRIGUE: -- Working hard or hardly working? A leaked set of Trump\u2019s private schedules from the past three months show that about 60 percent of his workdays are spent on unstructured \"Executive Time,\" which includes watching cable TV and calling friends.\u00a0Axios\u2019s Alexi McCammond and Jonathan Swan report: \u201cTrump, an early riser, usually spends the first 5 hours of the day in Executive Time. Each day's schedule places Trump in 'Location: Oval Office' from 8 to 11 a.m. But Trump, who often wakes before 6 a.m., is never in the Oval during those hours, according to six sources with direct knowledge. Instead, he spends his mornings in the residence, watching TV, reading the papers, and responding to what he sees and reads by phoning aides, members of Congress, friends, administration officials and informal advisers. Trump's first meeting of the day \u2014 usually around 11 or 11:30 a.m. \u2014 is often an intelligence briefing or a 30-minute meeting with the chief of staff.\u201d Here are all of the schedules. -- Tomorrow night's State of the Union comes at a tumultuous point in the Trump presidency, with another potential government shutdown looming and Nancy Pelosi now sitting behind him.\u00a0Philip Rucker, Josh Dawsey and Toluse Olorunnipa report: \u201cTrump is as unchecked and isolated as ever. Inside the White House, aides describe a chaotic, freewheeling atmosphere reminiscent of the early weeks of Trump\u2019s presidency. Power has consolidated around presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner,\u00a0a senior adviser who is functioning as a de facto White House chief of staff. With counterweights like ousted chief of staff John F. Kelly gone, some advisers say the West Wing has the feel of the\u00a026th\u00a0floor of Trump Tower, where an unrestrained Trump had absolute control over his family business and was free to follow his impulses. \u2026 \u201cAlthough the fight for a border wall has been a chief focus of Trump\u2019s for the past two months, the president\u2019s advisers said his address would not be an immigration-centric jeremiad, but rather would set a governing agenda for the year ahead. For instance, Trump plans to talk about infrastructure development and prescription-drug pricing, two issues with broad bipartisan appeal, according to a senior White House official. The president also is expected to talk about foreign affairs and highlight his administration\u2019s recent moves in Venezuela to force President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power, as well as Trump\u2019s ongoing trade negotiations with China and his planned summit this month with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Meanwhile, conservative leaders are urging Trump to weave in heavy language on abortion after [Northam] sparked national outcry last week for comments interpreted as defending infanticide.\u201d -- Stacey Abrams is writing the Democratic response to the State of the Union herself, aides said.\u00a0Vanessa Williams reports: \u201cShe weaves together stories of her life and anecdotes of people she has met on the campaign trail to help explain her policy positions and to connect with audiences. Traveling around Georgia, she focused on expanding eligibility for Medicaid, providing more money for public schools, creating jobs and helping small-business owners, especially in smaller cities and rural areas. Those themes are likely to be included in her 10-minute response Tuesday.\u201d -- Republican congressional leadership has expressed concern about the high number of vacancies in Trump\u2019s administration. Juliet Eilperin, Josh Dawsey and Seung Min Kim report: \u201cTo deal with the number of vacancies in the upper ranks of departments, agencies have been relying on novel and legally questionable personnel moves that could leave the administration\u2019s policies open to court challenges. \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s a lot, it\u2019s way too many,\u2019 Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) said of the acting positions in Cabinet agencies. \u2026 One particular vacancy senators have fixated on is at the Pentagon, where former defense secretary Jim Mattis resigned in December after clashing with Trump over his decision to begin withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria. Patrick Shanahan has been serving in an acting capacity since Jan. 1.\u201d -- Shanahan appears to be trying to prove his ability to take on a permanent role as defense secretary. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Gordon Lubold and Michael C. Bender report: \u201cMr. Trump in private conversations has voiced satisfaction with the arrangement, saying interim leaders are more beholden to the Oval Office, according to a person familiar with the conversation. \u2026 Although Mr. Shanahan appears to be the front-runner for the permanent post, Vice President Mike Pence has been tasked with identifying other candidates. Under consideration are financier David McCormick; Navy Secretary Richard Spencer; Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson; Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats; and former Sen. Jim Talent (R., Mo.), according to people familiar with the deliberations.\u201d -- Senior intelligence officials who brief Trump say he shows a \u201cwillful ignorance\u201d about the information he is presented. Time\u2019s John Walcott reports: \u201cThe officials, who include analysts who prepare Trump\u2019s briefs and the briefers themselves, describe futile attempts to keep his attention by using visual aids, confining some briefing points to two or three sentences, and repeating his name and title as frequently as possible. What is most troubling, say these officials and others in government and on Capitol Hill who have been briefed on the episodes, are Trump\u2019s angry reactions when he is given information that contradicts positions he has taken or beliefs he holds. Two intelligence officers even reported that they have been warned to avoid giving the President intelligence assessments that contradict stances he has taken in public.\u201d -- Rewarding loyalists: Trump tapped Ronny Jackson to be his chief medical adviser and for promotion to two-star admiral despite an ongoing Pentagon investigation into the allegations that last year derailed Jackson\u2019s nomination as VA secretary. Dan Lamothe and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cA spokesman for the Defense Department Inspector General\u2019s Office, Bruce Anderson, said his office\u2019s investigation into Jackson is still ongoing. \u2026 It isn\u2019t clear whether the Armed Services Committee will act on Jackson\u2019s new promotion nomination while the investigation is still ongoing.\u201d -- Chris Christie said he advised Trump against tweeting about the Russia investigation. \u201cHe knows full well I think it\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d Christie said. \u201cI told him back in February of 2017 there is no way to make this investigation shorter, but there are lots of ways to make it longer.\u2026. Every time he said something new or different, the prosecutors have to chase it down. It makes the investigation go on longer.\u201d (Wall Street Journal) Robert Higdon, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina, holds a news conference last April at Fayetteville City Hall. (Andrew Craft\/Fayetteville Observer) THE IMMIGRATION WARS: -- A Trump-appointed prosecutor in North Carolina decided to focus on prosecuting noncitizens who voted in 2016 and missed legitimate election fraud that has left a congressional seat unfilled for the past month. Amy Gardner, Beth Reinhard and Alice Crites report: During a series of arrests last year, \u201c20 immigrants \u2014 two still in pajamas \u2014 were rounded up over several days, many of them handcuffed and shackled, and charged with voting illegally in the 2016 presidential election. The sweep across eastern North Carolina was one of the most aggressive voting-fraud crackdowns by [U.S. Attorney Robert Higdon Jr.] \u2014 and also a deliberate choice that demonstrates where the administration\u2019s priorities stand. At the time of the arrests, an organized ballot-tampering effort that state officials had repeatedly warned about was allegedly gearing up in the same part of North Carolina. The operation burst into public view after Election Day in November when the state elections board, citing irregularities in the mail-in vote, refused to certify the results of the 9th Congressional District race.\u201d -- A CBS News poll found that more than 6 in 10 voters oppose Trump declaring a national emergency to get funding for his border wall. CBS News\u2019s Anthony Salvanto, Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus and Kabir Khanna report: \u201cIf government funding runs out on Feb. 15 and there's still an impasse over wall funding, Americans don't want either side to force another shutdown. Seventy-three percent of Americans want Mr. Trump to continue negotiating while keeping the government open, rather than demand wall funding if that forces a shutdown. A similar number (75 percent) say congressional Democrats should also continue negotiating, rather than deny funding in a move that might force a shutdown.\u201d -- But Sen. John Hoeven\u00a0(R-N.D.), a\u00a0Republican member of the bipartisan committee created to seek a funding agreement,\u00a0said Trump \u201cwould be forced\u201d to declare an emergency if the group can\u2019t reach a deal. \u201cI think what the president is saying is if we don\u2019t compromise \u2014 and he\u2019s put compromise on the table, real compromise, things the Democrats want \u2014 but if we can't get compromise out of Speaker Pelosi and get to a good solution, then he would be forced to go the national emergency route,\u201d Hoeven said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d But he maintained that an immigration deal passed by both chambers of Congress was still \u201cthe best solution.\u201d (Politico) -- The rapper 21 Savage was taken into ICE custody on allegations of overstaying his U.S. visa.

Andrews reports: \u201cThough he is often touted as a local Atlanta rapper, ICE officials say he is actually \u2018a United Kingdom national\u2019 and has overstayed his visa. \u2018[Sha Yaa Bin] Abraham-Joseph initially entered the U.S. legally in July 2005, but subsequently failed to depart under the terms of his nonimmigrant visa and he became unlawfully present in the U.S. when his visa expired in July 2006,\u2019 ICE spokesman Bryan Cox told The Washington Post in a statement. \u2026 The rapper has been placed in \u2018removal proceedings before the federal immigration courts,\u2019 Cox said. \u2018ICE will now await the outcome of his case before a federal immigration judge to determine future actions.\u2019\u201d THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- The United States has pursued an aggressive campaign to pressure European firms to stop doing business with Iran. Griff Witte and Erin Cunningham report: \u201cSince [Trump] announced in May that he was pulling the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal, European governments have sought to keep the agreement on track by keeping their companies engaged in Iranian trade. Europe last week unveiled its most dramatic step to date, with the creation of a trading system that could be used to allow firms to skirt U.S. restrictions. But the European effort remains mild compared with the zeal with which the United States has been pressing the continent\u2019s firms to get out, say industry associations, government officials, analysts and representatives of companies that have been targeted.\u201d -- Ji Seong-ho, the North Korean defector turned human rights activist who appeared at last year\u2019s State of the Union, worries the plight of the North Korean people has fallen off the radar as Trump and Kim Jong Un plan a second nuclear summit. David Nakamura and Min Joo Kim report: \u201cSince Ji\u2019s starring role in last year\u2019s State of the Union, Trump has said almost nothing about the plight of the North Korean people, more than 100,000 of whom are estimated to be held in hard-labor prison camps. Instead, the president has abruptly shifted from a \u2018fire and fury\u2019 condemnation of the North to an unprecedented strategy of engagement with Kim \u2026 Ji and several other North Korean defectors who\u00a0visited the Oval Office\u00a0a year ago remain uncertain whether their partnership with Trump will lead to the human rights improvements that they have sought.\u201d -- The inventor of what he describes as a nearly indestructible smartphone screen teamed up with the FBI after he began to suspect the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei tried to steal his technology. Bloomberg Businessweek\u2019s Erik Schatzker reports: \u201cLike all inventors, [Adam] Khan was paranoid about knockoffs. Even so, he was caught by surprise when Huawei, a potential customer, began to behave suspiciously after receiving the meticulously packed sample. Khan was more surprised when the [FBI] drafted him and Akhan\u2019s chief operations officer, Carl Shurboff, as participants in its investigation of Huawei. The FBI asked them to travel to Las Vegas and conduct a meeting with Huawei representatives at last month\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show. Shurboff was outfitted with surveillance devices and recorded the conversation while a Bloomberg Businessweek reporter watched from a safe distance.\u201d -- A former mayor of San Salvador won El Salvador\u2019s presidential race. Anna-Catherine Brigida reports: \u201cNayib Bukele, 37, who campaigned as a change from the country\u2019s traditional politics, dominated by former guerrillas and a party associated with past military-backed governments, had 53.7 percent of the vote with 89 percent of the ballots counted. One of voters\u2019 most significant concerns is violence blamed on gangs, which have enormous power in this Central American nation. Although homicide rates have been decreasing from a peak in 2015, El Salvador remains one of the most violent countries in the world, with more than 3,300 killings last year in a nation of about 6.5 million residents. The violence is a key factor driving migration to the United States. The presidential candidates pledged to find ways to reduce the violence, offering crime-prevention programs instead of an iron-fisted approach. But they provided few details.\u201d -- Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy is struggling to keep pace as shifting government policy has resulted in the mass exodus of foreign workers. Saudi Arabia encouraged foreign workers to emigrate during the oil boom of the 1970\u2019s, but Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is trying to prioritize Saudi citizens in his plans to remake the country\u2019s economy. (Kareem Fahim) -- Trump\u2019s special representative for international negotiations, Jason Greenblatt, has been tweeting at the Palestinian officials who have refused to meet with him since the president recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Ruth Eglash reports: \u201cDuring the past few weeks, Greenblatt has been tweeting his thoughts, requests and criticisms to those Palestinian leaders who are active on the popular social media platform. This weekend, he seemed to confirm his new brand of tweet-diplomacy, writing: \u2018And who says the U.S. and the P.A. aren\u2019t talking? The only difference now is that we are speaking about these matters in public via twitter so the public can understand everyone\u2019s positions. Transparency is better for all.\u2019\u201d -- Trump reiterated his pledge to get U.S. troops out of Syria and Afghanistan during an interview with CBS News that aired before the Super Bowl. \u201cWhen I took over Syria it was infested with ISIS. It was all over the place,\u201d Trump told \u201cFace the Nation\u201d host Margaret Brennan. \u201cAnd now you have very little ISIS and you have the caliphate almost knocked out. ...\u00a0We will be announcing in the not too distant future 100 percent of the caliphate, which is the area, the land, the area, 100 [percent]. We're at 99 percent right now, we'll be at 100.\u201d The comments\u00a0contradicted testimony from Trump\u2019s intelligence chiefs last week. (Politico) -- But Trump added he wanted to keep troops in Iraq to \u201cwatch Iran.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep watching and we\u2019re going to keep seeing and if there\u2019s trouble, if somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things, we\u2019re going to know it before they do,\u201d he told CBS News.

Scott Applewhite\/AP) 2020 WATCH: -- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) co-wrote an op-ed for today's New York Times with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to advocate for limiting stock buybacks. They write: \u201cOver the past several decades, corporate boardrooms have become obsessed with maximizing only shareholder earnings to the detriment of workers and the long-term strength of their companies, helping to create the worst level of income inequality in decades. One way in which this pervasive corporate ethos manifests itself is the explosion of stock buybacks. \u2026 This practice of corporate self-indulgence is not new, but it\u2019s grown enormously. Fueled by the Trump tax cut, in 2018, United States corporations repurchased more than $1 trillion of their own stock, a staggering figure and the highest amount ever authorized in a single year.\u201d -- The Washington Post\u2019s Editorial Board endorses\u00a0Sanders\u2019s proposal to increase the estate tax. The board writes: \u201cRich heirs would still be rich after paying a Sanders tax. But their unearned head start over their less fortunate cohort would be shorter, and the government would have more resources to help promote opportunity for everyone else.\u201d -- Primaries in Western states are taking on an outsize role in the Democratic nomination race for 2020. The Boston Globe\u2019s Jess Bidgood reports: \u201cThe delegate-rich state of California has vaulted itself near the front of the primary calendar, which means candidates seeking to break away from the pack will be looking to build early support on the left coast. The action has already begun in Nevada, the third state to vote, which also hosted a parade of potential candidates during the midterms. \u2026 The West has a younger, more diverse population than the traditional early\u2009states of Iowa and New Hampshire, and they are expected to tilt the Democratic\u2009debate toward issues such as\u2009immigration and climate policy. \u2026 The reworked primary calendar could also dissuade candidates from dropping anchor in Iowa or New Hampshire for long stretches, potentially raising Nevada\u2019s stock among the quartet of early voting states that includes South Carolina.\u201d Harry Reid, who still plays a prominent role in Nevada Democratic politics, stopped just short of endorsing Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in the race. \u201cShe\u2019s a good person. I think the world of her,\u201d Reid said. \u201cMy Nevada politics keep me from publicly endorsing her, which I will not do. But anything I can do to help Elizabeth Warren short of the endorsement, I will do.\u201d -- Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., who is widely considered a long shot for the Democratic nomination, defended his candidacy in an ABC News interview. \u201cI get the audacity of somebody like me talking about running for this office, but frankly it\u2019s a leap for anybody,\u201d Buttigieg told ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. \u201cAnd yet all of the people who had that job have been mortals who just bring their experience to the table. My experience is that of guiding a city through transformation, and I think a mayor at any level has the kind of executive frontline government experience and, by the way, problem solving experience that we need more in Washington right now.\u201d (ABC News) SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: The president's daughter marked Black History Month as Virginia's governor sought to survive: The RNC chairwoman demanded Northam's resignation: The swift condemnation prompted accusations of hypocrisy.

But one field withstood the onslaught, and even thrived: the Permian Basin, straddling Texas and New Mexico. A combination of technical innovation, aggressive investing and copious layers of oil-rich shale have transformed the Permian, once considered a worn-out patch, into the world\u2019s second-most-productive oil field. And this transformation has apparently inoculated Texas against its traditional economic enemy, the boom-and-bust cycle pegged to oil prices.\u201d -- Wall Street Journal, \u201cOver 60, and Crushed by Student Loan Debt,\u201d by AnnaMaria Andriotis: \u201cOne generation of Americans owed $86 billion in student loan debt at last count.

On average, student loan borrowers in their 60s owed $33,800 in 2017, up 44% from 2010, according to data compiled for The Wall Street Journal by credit-reporting firm TransUnion.

Upon closer look, the substance appeared to be separating, lifting from the edge of the dish.

At some point \u2014 anywhere among Patrick Corbin, Yan Gomes, Kurt Suzuki, Brian Dozier, Anibal Sanchez, Trevor Rosenthal, Kyle Barraclough and Matt Adams \u2014 they will suggest you are forgetting a name. They won\u2019t consider that he wasn\u2019t acquired in free agency or by trade. They will just remind you that Howie Kendrick is healthy. \u201cI could hit him anywhere in the lineup, play him at second, first, outfield, he was doing really well,\u201d Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said, almost wistfully, of Kendrick in the first month and a half of last season. \u201cBut what people don\u2019t realize is Howie in that clubhouse, he\u2019s the constant.\u201d Now he\u2019s back. Kendrick, 35, ruptured his right Achilles\u2019 tendon in May and spent the next nine months rehabilitating. He spent his offseason in Arizona with a personal trainer, going from walking to running to, as of three weeks ago, sprinting and changing direction. He called his manager ahead of spring training and urged Martinez not to hold him back. He doubled down on that request when he stopped by Martinez\u2019s office last week, walking without any trace of a limp and ready to show that, while the Nationals spent their winter plucking players off the free agent and trade markets, another key piece is back in the mix. There aren\u2019t many do-it-all, late-career veterans who play four positions, mentor young guys and have hit .291 across 13 major league seasons. And however Kendrick performs in the final season of a two-year deal, he will provide a right-handed bat off the bench, depth at second base, depth at first base, depth in the corner outfield spots and an earnest, easygoing presence in the clubhouse. The Nationals believe that\u2019s integral to their makeup. \u201c[Martinez] told me he\u2019s going to keep an eye on me,\u201d Kendrick said, \u201cbut as of right now, I\u2019m going to go out with the team and do everything everyone else is doing.\u201d Aside from the Nationals modifying his running, Kendrick was a full participant in the first two days of team workouts in West Palm Beach. He has worked behind Dozier at second base, chasing down grounders and whipping the ball around the infield. He took live batting practice Wednesday. And he is expected to get scattered repetitions in the outfield in the coming weeks. In November, Rizzo downplayed the Nationals\u2019 need for a starting second baseman by expressing confidence in a platoon of Kendrick and Wilmer Difo. That could have been Rizzo\u2019s way of deflecting his intent to wade into a second base market that included Dozier, DJ LeMahieu, Ian Kinsler, Jed Lowrie, Josh Harrison and Marwin Gonzalez, who remains unsigned. Or maybe it was true at the time and the Nationals had a plan for Kendrick and Difo before Dozier became a logical bargain on a one-year, $9 million contract. The signing of Dozier bumped Kendrick and Difo to the bench and again shifted Kendrick into a utility role. It\u2019s what he would have done the bulk of last year for the Nationals with Daniel Murphy starting full-time at second after returning from an early-season injury. It\u2019s a role that fits given his age and the many different ways he can be used. \u201cYou know my role on this team hasn\u2019t changed. I\u2019m going to play everywhere like I did in the previous couple years, and you know I look at it like that,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cThe at-bats I get are the at-bats I get. I\u2019m not here to complain about anything. I\u2019m here to play baseball, try to help guys get better and try to win ballgames. At the end of the day I think that\u2019s really important. As far as Dozier, he\u2019s the second baseman. Guy can play.\u201d Working behind Dozier on Wednesday, Kendrick showed how far he has come since he was carted off the field in May. He darted to his left, lunged for a low-skipping grounder, pivoted on his left foot and fired a dart to shortstop Trea Turner at second. Next he ranged up the middle and, without breaking stride, redirected a ball with a flashy glove flip that shaved a second off the double play exchange. The ball found Difo\u2019s glove at second without Difo having to move it. There were light cheers from around the field as Kendrick, smiling, jogged back to take another. \u201cWhoa!\u201d yelled Nationals bench coach Chip Hale, who smacked each grounder. \u201cAtta boy, Howard!\u201d With defensive work winding down, Hale paused to look out at Kendrick and yelled, \u201cOkay, Howard, what are you going to do this one?\u201d Hale hit a slow chopper that forced Kendrick to sprint forward, scoop the ball with his chest parallel to the grass and submarine a throw to first base while on the move. That got more cheers from his teammates. Kendrick then lingered on the third base line, laughing with Anthony Rendon and Turner, before Hale came up behind him with an important piece of praise. \u201cAtta boy, Howard,\u201d Hale, full of energy, said much quieter this time. \u201cYou look better every day.\u201d Read more on the Nationals: In Bryce Harper chase, Phillies must bridge \u2018stupid\u2019 money to \u2018willing to walk away\u2019 Anthony Rendon on extension talks: \u2018If both parties can be happy, then we\u2019ll see\u2019 Thomas Boswell: The Nationals know what they have in Juan Soto, and it might be historic Barry Svrluga: Nats VP Doug Harris needed help to beat cancer a second time.

The company released its financial details for the first time on Friday, giving the public a glimpse into its performance before deciding whether to buy into a transportation trend that has changed the way tens of millions of people get around. The unveiling came nearly three months after the San Francisco company filed confidential documents for its initial public offering of stock. Lyft reported $2.2 billion in revenue last year \u2014 more than double its $1.1 billion in revenue in 2017. That continued a growth trajectory that saw revenue more than triple in 2017 compared with 2016, when the company brought in $343.3 million. But Lyft is still losing money and its executives warned it may struggle to turn a profit, according to Friday\u2019s filing. The company lost $911 million last year, bringing its total losses to nearly $3 billion since 2012 while raking in $5.1 billion in venture capital. Its cash balance also is shrinking. Lyft had $517 million in cash and equivalents at the end of last year, about half of what it had at the end of 2017. The IPO will enable the company to raise more cash to finance its operations and expand while management tries to figure out way to turn a profit. The next step for Lyft will be to meet with potential investors during presentations known as a \u201croad show\u201d on Wall Street, then determine how much stock it will sell in the IPO and how much to demand for its shares. If all goes smoothly, Lyft\u2019s stock market debut will likely occur in late March or early April. Lyft has been in a race with Uber to be first to offer its stock to the public, and has positioned itself as the affable alternative to its larger and more ubiquitous rival. Uber, which struggled with public relations setbacks in the past, expects to file its IPO later this year. Together, the two could raise billions of dollars to fuel their expansions and give investors an opportunity to see how the companies plan to become sustainable. Lyft\u2019s filing says that its co-founders \u2014 CEO Logan Green, 35, and President John Zimmer, 34 \u2014 will keep significant control of the company after it goes public and \u201cwill be able to significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders,\u201d including the election of board members, a merger, asset sales or other major corporate transactions. The company\u2019s share of the U.S. ride-hailing market was 39 percent in December 2018, up from 22 percent in December 2016, according to the filing, which cited growth from new drivers and riders as well as increased ride frequency. It reported 30.7 million riders and 1.9 million drivers in more than 300 cities in 2018, and has given more than 1 billion rides since its inception in 2012, according to the filing. Lyft\u2019s market-share gains in recent years came at a time when Uber was dogged by reports that drivers accosted passengers and that the company allowed rampant sexual harassment internally \u2014 revelations that ultimately led its co-founder Travis Kalanick to resign. Uber has been working to repair its image under CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who tweeted congratulations to the Lyft team Friday, calling it \u201ca big moment for ridesharing!\u201d Lyft allowed customers to tip drivers earlier than Uber, building into its brand the sense that it treats drivers better than its main competitor. In its filing, Lyft said it will pay cash bonuses of $1,000 and $10,000 to drivers who meet certain criteria, and that drivers may use those bonuses to buy the company\u2019s shares. Bookings, a figure representing Lyft\u2019s fares after subtracting taxes, tolls and tips, have been rising dramatically \u2014 a trend that the company intends to underscore in its presentation to potential investors. Lyft\u2019s bookings surpassed $8 billion last year, 76 percent more than in 2017 and more than four times the number from 2016. The company\u2019s revenue of $2.2 billion last year represents Lyft\u2019s slice of the bookings. \u201cWe believe this is a key indicator of the utility of transportation solutions provided through our multimodal platform, as well as the scale and growth in our business,\u201d the company said in the filing. Lyft, known for the pink moustaches that used to adorn car grilles, was valued at just over $15 billion last year. In addition to ride-hailing, it offers shared car, bike and scooter rides. By being the first company in the ride-hailing category to go public, Lyft is likely to attract institutional investors who want to get in on the sector, said Rohit Kulkarni, senior vice president of research at Forge. Based on the figures in the filing, and assuming steady revenue growth of more than 50 percent in the next year, institutional investors are likely to value Lyft at $20 billion to $25 billion, he said. The next step is for Lyft managers to go on the road to woo investors, presenting details and fielding questions from potential buyers in hopes of drumming up interest. That will help the company determine the price of its shares when it goes public, likely in late March or early April. \u201cLyft has clearly demonstrated progress along its pathway to profitability ... but the key question is whether Lyft can accelerate its pathway to profitability,\u201d Kulkarni said. \u201cOn its upcoming roadshow, public equity investors would have a lot of tough questions for Lyft\u2019s management on this topic.\u201d In its risk assessments, Lyft outlined the difficulty of attracting and retaining drivers and riders \u201cin a cost-effective manner,\u201d complying with laws and regulations, and being able to manage growth and expand beyond the U.S. and part of Canada. The company conceded that it has lost money since it started in mid-2012 and its expenses are increasing as it launches new services. \u201cWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future,\u201d the company said. Lyft also said it faces intense competition and could lose market share to competitors. The company acknowledged the importance of developing autonomous vehicle technology on its own or with partners. Uber \u2014 as well as Waymo, General Motors and others \u2014 is working on self-driving vehicles, which they expect to enter the ride-hailing business.

Leaders have hinted that the changes will affect the proliferation and availability of semiautomatic weapons in particular. The changes were agreed to in principle by the country\u2019s coalition government Monday \u2014 just 72 hours after the deadliest act of gun violence in New Zealand history. Details of the changes will be announced within the week and must be passed by Parliament.\u00a0 The swift action in New Zealand stands in sharp contrast to the intractable debate over gun rights and regulations in the United States, where efforts to impose more regulations on guns nationwide have largely failed despite frequent mass shootings. The U.S. gun debate gained momentum last year after a gunman killed 17 students and staff at a high school in Parkland, Fla., but the resulting campaign for an overhaul left most gun laws unchanged. Another proposed overhaul of gun regulations was rejected by Congress \u2014 in what President Barack Obama declared was a \u201cshameful day\u201d \u2014 months after a massacre of 20 children and six teachers in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. In New Zealand, police have identified the gunman in Friday\u2019s attack on two mosques as a 28-year-old Australian, Brenton Tarrant, who pledged allegiance to white nationalist causes. He has been remanded on one charge of murder with more to follow. The shooting rampage killed 50 people \u2014 more than\u00a0all the people murdered across New Zealand in 2017. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern labeled the massacre\u00a0\u201cthe worst act of terrorism on our shores\u201d and immediately promised swift action, calling for gun laws to be changed. Her declarations have been celebrated by many in New Zealand, some of whom had no idea that military-style semiautomatic weapons were so prolific in a country known for its extremely low murder rate.\u00a0 Simon Bridges, the leader of the center-right National Party, which is part of the ruling coalition, said Monday that he was \u201copen to any and all changes\u201d and that banning military-style semiautomatic weapons is \u201cprobably the right way to go.\u201d On Monday, the e-commerce website Trade Me, similar to eBay, halted the sale of semiautomatic weapons on its platform.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of contact from Kiwis over the weekend about this issue, and many felt we should stop the sale of these items in the wake of this attack,\u201d Trade Me said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve listened to these sentiments and we\u2019ve put this ban in place while we await clear direction from the government.\u201d\u00a0 John Hart, a gun owner, said on Twitter\u00a0that he has given up his AR-15 rifle and ammunition because his\u00a0\u201cconvenience doesn\u2019t outweigh the risk of misuse.\u201d Still, some gun dealers have bristled at the idea that they or the weapons they sell are culpable in Friday\u2019s events and have resented being put on the spot.\u00a0 \u201cWe have good laws; we\u2019ve always had good laws,\u201d said Wayne Chapman, owner of the Gunshop in Upper Hutt, a city northeast of Wellington. His store, he said,\u00a0\u201chas not seen a surge or had any problems.\u201d\u00a0 David Tipple, managing director of Gun City, one of the largest firearms retailers in New Zealand, called a news conference Monday to announce that Tarrant had bought four guns from Gun City\u2019s online store and had them delivered through the mail.\u00a0 Gun City has been the focus of criticism, and small protests have formed outside its stores in recent days. Many on social media have said a billboard outside the store\u2019s Christchurch outlet, which shows a man teaching two young children how to shoot, is in poor taste considering that the country is in a state of mourning over the killings.\u00a0 Tarrant obtained his gun license in November 2017 and purchased his first firearm about a month later, Tipple said. He bought his last firearm from Gun City in March 2018 and purchased ammunition as well. Tipple said he has shared this information with authorities.\u00a0 But in a testy exchange with reporters, Tipple pushed back on the charge that the guns he sold Tarrant were the same ones used in the mosque attacks. Tipple\u00a0said the guns were \u201cA-category\u201d guns, which can be bought with the most basic weapons license. Assault rifles are A-category guns as long as they have a magazine that holds only seven rounds. The weapons seen in a video of the massacre that Tarrant live-streamed had much larger magazines.\u00a0 \u201cI totally agree there should be a gun debate, but today is not the day,\u201d Tipple said. \u201cWe are not a country of emotional responses. We are a country with laws, [and] what we are doing is legal.\u201d New Zealand gun owners point out that it is exactly the loophole Tipple brought up \u2014 purchasing larger magazines \u2014 that enabled the mass shooting. One gun owner who owned several AR-15s but has since given them up said they cost only $1,200 in New Zealand but would cost $25,000 or more in Australia on the black market, because they are effectively banned there. \u201cYou can get an AR-15 from anywhere, really, and while the [30-round magazine] is not allowed legally, they will fit and they will work,\u201d said Pete Breidahl, a gun owner and former competition shooter who recently gave up his firearms license.\u00a0\u201cHow, in 2019, can this still be going on? How has this loophole not been fixed?\u201d\u00a0 New Zealand, like the United States, has no requirement for gun owners to register their weapons, unlike many other countries.\u00a0 Tightened gun laws would put New Zealand in line with several other countries that have changed legislation in the wake of tragedy. A 1996 massacre in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in which 35 people were killed shook Australia and resulted in gun legislation that strictly restricted self-loading rifles and other weapons. A buyback program destroyed thousands of guns and high-capacity magazines. A shooting at a primary school in Dunblane, Scotland,\u00a0that same year also prompted a campaign for tighter restrictions on firearms, which led to a virtual ban on civilian ownership of handguns.\u00a0 Still, New Zealand has made the decision in almost record time. In Australia, it took 12 days after the mass shooting for the government to finalize changes to legislation. It took almost two years for the ban on handguns to become law in the United Kingdom in 1998. Ardern has promised details of changes within 10 days of the attack.\u00a0 Experts argue that New Zealand has indeed been on the cusp of change in gun legislation for years but never had political unity around the issue. After the country\u2019s last mass shooting, in 1990, when 13 people including local police were killed in the seaside town of Aramoana, changes were made to firearms legislation, including restrictions on semiautomatic firearms and the requirement for 10-year licenses. Four inquiries have been undertaken by government in recent years. A 1997 review recommended that all guns should be registered and that the government institute a full buyback of all military-style assault weapons, similar to what was done in Australia. These suggestions, said\u00a0Philip Alpers, an adjunct associate professor at the University of Sydney and founding director of GunPolicy.org, \u201care all now back on the table.\u201d\u00a0 The government\u2019s decision, he said, has been in part motivated by the frequency of mass shootings in the United States, which has among the most lax gun laws in the world.\u00a0 \u201cThere is a baseline determination not to go down the American road,\u201d he said.","60":"* Flood warnings in effect for much of the D.C. area into the overnight hours * 10:05 p.m. update: The heavy rain has eased across the DMV, but light to moderate showers continue to spiral through the area for the next few hours.

For the first time since becoming Pentagon chief last month, Shanahan was asked to answer for the uncertainties produced by the president\u2019s often unpopular foreign policy. The former Boeing executive, who took over in January after the abrupt resignation of his predecessor, Jim Mattis, deferred to the president\u2019s decisions and suggested, in high-level talks, steps that U.S. allies can take to adjust. At the conclusion of the trip, Shanahan told reporters that he had anticipated a \u201cmore standoffish\u201d reception. \u201cThe pushback was we need these issues addressed, these questions answered,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were no promises or guarantees, but there was support.\u201d As Shanahan publicly auditions to keep the military\u2019s top job, the gaps that critics have identified in his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 could win him favor with his commander in chief: slim foreign policy experience and limited investment in the counterterrorism wars that have monopolized the military\u2019s focus for two decades. \u201cShanahan comes from the business executive world, and he\u2019s considerably freer about some of the guardrails of the Washington foreign policy establishment,\u201d said Elbridge Colby, a former Pentagon official who worked closely with Shanahan. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to leave some things in the past.\u201d Current and former officials described a more dispassionate approach to the counterinsurgency campaigns that have emerged as a friction point between Trump and his generals. Since becoming the Pentagon\u2019s No. 2 in 2017, Shanahan has brought a private-sector view to his priorities of modernizing the military and preparing for possible conflict with China. Like the president, he has little previous experience with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, said Shanahan takes a results-oriented view of those conflicts, which have failed to produce lasting security despite almost two decades and billions of dollars of effort. Colby said there was \u201ca lot of water under the bridge\u201d for senior military leaders, in contrast, when it comes to those wars. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to lead people into the fight in Iraq or Afghanistan, you have to believe in it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been to Arlington too many times to fake it.\u201d The 56-year-old engineer takes over at the Pentagon at a moment of intensified congressional oversight and controversy over the president\u2019s moves to involve the military in his plans for the U.S.-Mexico border. When Mattis quit in December over differences with Trump, Shanahan was a little-known quantity outside the Pentagon. Mattis, a retired Marine general, cut a larger-than-life figure in Washington, lauded by members of both parties for seeking to steer Trump toward traditional foreign policy positions. Shanahan was more focused on internal Pentagon matters. While he sometimes attended top-level White House meetings on Mattis\u2019s behalf, his chief responsibilities were less visible, including a Pentagon audit and a proposal to create a new space force. Shanahan, known during his decades-long Boeing career as a driven manager who helped turn around the company\u2019s troubled Dreamliner program, brought an unceremonious, West Coast style to the Pentagon, former colleagues said. For weekend work sessions, he would show up in workout gear and jeans, and occasionally ribbed other officials who came in button-downs and khakis. While how much progress Shanahan made in reforming the department\u2019s byzantine practices remains a matter of debate, he seemed to connect with Trump, another businessman and Washington outsider. \u201cThe challenge for him will be the need to move from deputy, focused on internal matters, running the Pentagon, budgetary matters, business processes and so on, to a highly visible, foreign policy-inflected role in a highly unusual administration,\u201d said Richard Fontaine, president of the Center for a New American Security and a former adviser to the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.). As acting secretary, Shanahan is responsible for ushering core defense alliances through a period of unprecedented tension over Trump\u2019s decisions on Syria, Afghanistan and arms control, and his adversarial approach to trade, Iran and multilateral organizations. In Afghanistan last week, Shanahan met with President Ashraf Ghani, who has voiced concern that the Trump administration could give too much away in nascent peace talks. Afghan leaders were unnerved late last year when military officials were instructed to begin drawing up plans for a major troop reduction at a time when Taliban militants continued to pose a major challenge. In Iraq, he held talks with Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi in the wake of political uproar caused by Trump\u2019s suggestion that the United States could leave troops in the country to \u201cwatch Iran.\u201d That statement energized Iraqi lawmakers who support legislation that could scuttle plans for a continued U.S. counterterrorism mission there. The friction was most evident in Europe, where Shanahan met with NATO ministers in Brussels and attended a global security conference in Munich. There, German Chancellor Angela Merkel received a standing ovation when she pushed back against Trump administration decisions Europeans see as unilateral and unjustified. Many European countries have complained that the decisions to remove troops from Syria and possibly Afghanistan were made without consulting allies fighting there too and could allow militants to regroup. Analysts said NATO leaders were anxious to take stock of the person replacing Mattis, who won European support as he appeared to exert unparalleled influence over Trump, securing a troop increase for Afghanistan and backing for traditional alliances. Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, said those leaders will evaluate Shanahan through the lens of Mattis\u2019s ultimate failure to convince Trump of the merits of more traditional foreign policy views. During Mattis\u2019s tenure, Trump pushed through a series of moves opposed by many Pentagon officials, including a costly military parade and suspension of military exercises with South Korea. \u201cIt was clear that Trump was his own boss by 2018,\u201d Daalder said. In that light, he said, \u201cfrankly, there isn\u2019t anything [Shanahan] can do or say to reassure allies in the way that Mattis could. That\u2019s his unenviable position.\u201d Continued uncertainty about Shanahan\u2019s own future could also diminish his effectiveness with already skeptical allies. Trump has said he prefers having Cabinet members who have not been confirmed, saying that keeping subordinates in an acting capacity increases his flexibility and allows him to \u201cgo fast.\u201d While Trump has publicly praised Shanahan, it remains unclear where Shanahan\u2019s views may differ from the president\u2019s and how much he will challenge him when they do. Shanahan\u2019s advisers judged his inaugural trip a solid performance. It will now be up to Trump whether he nominates Shanahan, leaves him in the job in an acting status, or chooses someone else. As he sought to make a favorable first impression, and with a president with often inscrutable personnel preferences, some of the biggest buzz of Shanahan\u2019s tour was related to his sartorial choice. Stepping out of a helicopter when he touched down at a military base in Kabul, Shanahan\u2019s angular dark jacket and black turtleneck contrasted with the Pentagon\u2019s unofficial civilian uniform of oxford shirt and blue blazer. The acting secretary made light of the moment days later. \u201cDid you like my outfit?\u201d Shanahan asked British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson as the two men shook hands at NATO headquarters. \u201cI did, I did,\u201d Williamson replied. The consensus, he said: \u201cYou look like Special Forces.\u201d","62":"The confirmed death toll rose to 60, with 292 people still missing, according to the fire department in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais. The toll was expected to grow \u201cexponentially\u201d Monday after no one was found alive Sunday, the department said. That stood in contrast to the first two days of the disaster, when helicopters whisked people out of the mud. Search efforts were extremely slow because of the treacherous sea of reddish-brown mud that surged when the dam breached Friday afternoon. The mud was up to 24 feet deep in some places. Rescue teams Monday morning focused their searches on areas where a bus was immersed and on the cafeteria of the Vale mining company, where many workers were eating lunch when the dam ruptured. Vale is the world\u2019s largest producer of iron ore, the raw ingredient for making steel. The Brazilian company\u2019s U.S. depository shares plunged 18 percent Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. At the scene of the disaster, helicopters looking for bodies took off and landed nonstop. On the ground, dozens of rescuers with tracking dogs were searching for bodies through the mountains of mud. More than 100 Israelis equipped with specialized rescue technology joined the 200 Brazilian firefighters in the search. Rescue efforts were suspended for about 10 hours Sunday because of fears that a second mine dam in Brumadinho was at risk of failing, but by afternoon, civil engineers said the second dam no longer posed a risk. Areas of water-soaked mud appeared to be drying out, which could help firefighters get to areas previously unreachable. Still, it was slow going for the search teams, residents were on edge, and some started searching on their own for relatives. A Catholic priest for a church now being used as a command center for rescuers said many of his parishioners are believed to be buried in mud. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult to rebuild our hearts,\u201d said the priest, the Rev. Rene Lopez. \u201cThis won\u2019t take a month or a year. It\u2019s an open wound for all of the people in Brumadinho.\u201d There was mounting anger directed at Vale, the area\u2019s largest employer, after an apparent lack of a warning siren ahead of Friday\u2019s collapse. \u201cThe company didn\u2019t take care of the people,\u201d said Josefa de Santos, who has friends and neighbors among the missing. \u201cI heard the cries of people asking for help. Everyone was running and screaming. The siren didn\u2019t go off at all. It was horrible.\u201d","63":"As New Zealand reeled from early reports on Friday that a gunman had opened fire on two mosques in Christchurch, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her \u201cthoughts\u201d were with the victims and their families \u2014 for a moment appearing to echo a stock response, \u201cthoughts and prayers,\u201d to mass shootings. The next morning, however, as details emerged about the variant of the AR-15 employed by the alleged perpetrator, she vowed, \u201cOur gun laws will change.\u201d Government officials began weighing options in cabinet discussions on Monday, and they expect to unveil changes within 10 days. A very different initiative in Missouri suggests why a similarly fast-track approach is virtually unthinkable in the United States. When Andrew McDaniel, a Republican member of the state\u2019s House of Representatives, got wind of the possibility that owning semiautomatic rifles could become more difficult halfway around the globe, a feeling of patriotism washed over him. \u201cI\u2019m glad I live in the USA,\u201d McDaniel, 35, said in an interview with The Washington Post. If the former sheriff\u2019s deputy, first elected in 2014 to a southeastern Missouri district, had his way, everyone in his state between the ages of 18 and 35 would own an AR-15. Well, sort of. He introduced legislation late last month that would require residents in that age range to purchase a version of the semiautomatic rifle. The bill is called the \u201cMcDaniel Militia Act.\u201d Another measure, the \u201cMcDaniel Second Amendment Act,\u201d would require everyone over the age of 21 to own a handgun. Each bill would also provide $1 million in tax credits for residents who purchase the weapons in compliance with the ordinances. The measures appeared to embody the particular American allegiance to the AR-15. The National Rifle Association calls the firearm \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Popular Rifle.\u201d A Virginia roofing company recently announced a promotion offering a free AR-15 with every roof installation. (The company did not respond to a request for comment.) At first, McDaniel\u2019s proposals hardly made waves. But local media became interested on the same day that authorities say 28-year-old Brenton Tarrant used five weapons \u2014 all obtained legally, including two semiautomatic weapons \u2014 to turn Friday prayers in Christchurch into a tableau of hatred and horror. Part of the reason Tarrant enlisted firearms in his crusade, according to a 74-page manifesto that authorities have linked to the Australian national, was to deepen American discord over the Second Amendment, \u201cto create conflict between the two ideologies within the United States on the ownership of firearms.\u201d There were already signs over the weekend that he had succeeded. After Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former Texas congressman and current Democratic presidential candidate, said Saturday that he did not think it was responsible to continue selling AR-15s in the United States, \u201cFox & Friends Weekend\u201d co-host Pete Hegseth urged viewers to \u201cgo out and get your second AR-15 today.\u201d The bruising debate over guns took on increased significance because of a 4-to-3 decision of the Connecticut Supreme Court last week finding that gun manufacturers are not necessarily immune from liability for crimes committed with their products. The suit was brought against Remington, which makes the Bushmaster AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle used by Adam Lanza in 2012, when he killed 26 people, including 20 children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. As the AR-15 became a flash point in the response to the terrorist violence in New Zealand, McDaniel\u2019s legislation emerged from the obscurity of Missouri\u2019s legislative docket. Neither measure has been scheduled for a hearing. Nevertheless, television stations in Kansas City, Mo., grew interested in the eponymous bills. Reports appeared in newspapers in St. Louis and Tulsa. The conservative website the Daily Caller weighed in. So did Splinter News, from the other end of the ideological spectrum. Soon, McDaniel was forced to clarify that he didn\u2019t \u2014 technically speaking \u2014 support his own bills, at least not as written. He wants the tax credits for firearms purchases, but that part about requiring everyone to own a gun? It was a tactic to try to bait the left. \u201cI wanted the media and the other side to jump on it, to show that our Second Amendment rights are under attack,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cI don\u2019t actually support mandates, hardly ever.\u201d But he didn\u2019t expect the national media to get involved, a development that has cast a harsh light on his efforts, he said, because of the timing of the mosque attacks in New Zealand. He called the massacre, which left 50 people dead, \u201chorrific\u201d and said he \u201cshould have known\u201d that the media would seize on his legislation in the wake of a tragedy. It\u2019s true, he acknowledged, that his intention had been to elicit breathless coverage in the press, but only from \u201clocal news organizations,\u201d he said. The AR-15 is again in a national spotlight because it is consistently favored by perpetrators of mass shootings \u2014 whether in Newtown, Parkland, Fla., or Las Vegas. The name is short for Armalite rifle, borrowed from the company that developed the weapon, which allowed soldiers in Vietnam to kill a large number of people very quickly. After the Federal Assault Weapons Ban lapsed in 2004, only a handful of statewide prohibitions stand. AR-15s are legal within certain specifications in New Zealand, where gun laws are more strict than they are in the United States but looser than regulations in Australia and much of Europe. In 2017, about 1.5 million guns were owned by civilians in the country of nearly 5 million, according to a tracking website maintained by the University of Sydney School of Public Health. A set of new rules went into effect following what had previously been the deadliest gun massacre in New Zealand\u2019s modern history, when a shooting rampage in 1990 left 14 people dead, including the gunman. Advocates of stricter gun control claim that mass murderers would be able to do less damage without such deadly weapons. But McDaniel said he would respond to this point with \u201cthe same argument I always use \u2014 people are going to be evil and do evil things no matter what.\u201d The only hope, he maintained, is that potential victims can \u201cprotect themselves against other evil people.\u201d Defending the AR-15 against the weapon\u2019s critics, McDaniel has found himself in a familiar role. He decided to run for office in the first place, he said, to rebut arguments coming from the left. He said he couldn\u2019t remember the specifics of what bothered him but recalled being \u201caggravated at the news\u201d and at \u201cfar-left ideas\u201d he encountered on television. \u201cSo instead of writing crazy stuff on Facebook, I decided to try to help people,\u201d said the state lawmaker, now in his third term. In addition to gun rights, he said he is also active in trying to stop abuse in nursing homes. He said he still hates politics. \u201cI\u2019m a country boy, born and raised on guns,\u201d said the Republican, who was featured in a 2016 story in St. Louis magazine called \u201cGuns Gone Wild.\u201d At the time, McDaniel was working on legislation to exempt gun owners with concealed-carry permits from submitting to federal background checks, according to the article, which pinpointed Missouri as ground zero in the \u201cslippery slope\u201d toward \u201chaving no gun restrictions at all.\u201d The lawmaker\u2019s ultimate goal was to be a prosecutor, he said, but he didn\u2019t have the funds to get far enough in school. He still hopes to complete a bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice. From his time policing the rural floodplains of Pemiscot County, where southeastern Missouri dips into a nook between Arkansas and Tennessee, he learned a lesson that has stayed with him: \u201cLaw enforcement\u2019s not always going to be there.\u201d \u201cI always have a gun on me, I\u2019ll put it that way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an attachment to my body.\u201d More from Morning Mix: \u2018I have to perform to save my life\u2019: Medical bills kept rock legend Dick Dale touring till the end He claimed his first wife died from a fall.

Fraser Anning, egged after mosque attacks, may be Australia\u2019s most reviled politician","64":"President Trump said Friday that he is picking his close ally Stephen Moore to fill an open seat on the Federal Reserve Board. Trump has repeatedly blamed the Fed for hurting the economy. Moore was an adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign and published a book \u201cTrumponomics: Inside the America First Plan to Revive Our Economy,\u201d heralding the president\u2019s tax cuts and deregulation push. Trump and Moore have discussed the Fed in recent weeks, with Moore telling the president that his other Fed nominees were too \u201cconventional\u201d and didn\u2019t understand the president\u2019s economic vision. Moore publicly urged Trump to fire Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell in December, which most experts think isn\u2019t legally possible. The White House plans to make a formal announcement that Moore is the nominee to fill one of two open Fed seats. Moore, who holds a master\u2019s degree in economics and is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, would then go through a Senate confirmation process that could take months. His nomination is likely to face opposition from Democrats. Moore is widely viewed as the most political nominee to the Fed board since the Reagan era. He published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal last week titled \u201cThe Fed Is a Threat to Growth,\u201d and he has suggested that Trump deserves a Nobel Prize in economics. \u201cTrump, who is not an economist, has more sense of the economy than these 500 overpaid economists at the Federal Reserve,\u201d Moore told The Post at the end of January. On Friday, Moore attempted a more conciliatory approach, telling Bloomberg TV that he looks forward to working with Powell and that he called for the Fed chair\u2019s removal in \u201ca time of anger.\u201d \u201cI really do believe we could have 3 or 4 percent growth for another five or six years,\u201d Moore said Friday. \u201cI know [Powell] wants high growth. He can be a hero if we get our monetary policy right at the same time we have strong pro-growth measures on the fiscal side of the equation.\u201d Past presidents have typically nominated to the board PhD economists and longtime bankers, who tended to be centrists. The Fed is an independent agency that is not supposed to be influenced by politics, and there are concerns that Moore would chip away at that independence. The central bank\u2019s primary role is setting the level of interest rates, which influence mortgage and credit card rates, and bank regulation. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin played a heavy role in Trump\u2019s other Fed nominations, and many economists and Wall Street investors welcomed those picks, but Trump began to regret some of his choices and called the Fed \u201cloco\u201d in October. This time, Trump saw Moore\u2019s Wall Street Journal op-ed and asked Larry Kudlow, head of the National Economic Council, why Moore wasn\u2019t Fed chair. Kudlow said he told the president that the Fed already has a chairman, but Moore would be a \u201cperfect Fed governor.\u201d \u201cSteve Moore is a brilliant guy. He knows a lot about monetary policy,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cPeople who are attacking Steve are attacking him for his beliefs.\" Trump has said numerous times that the economy and markets would be in better shape if the Fed had not raised interest rates four times last year, actions meant to keep the economy from overheating and get rates back to a more normal level as the nation recovered from the Great Recession. \u201cFrankly, if we didn\u2019t have somebody that would raise interest rates and do quantitative tightening, we would have been at over 4 instead of a 3.1,\u201d Trump said in a Fox Business interview Friday. The president was implying that the pace of growth last year could have been more than 4 percent without the Fed rate hikes, an assertion many independent economists doubt. The official Commerce Department figure is 2.9 percent growth for last year, but an alternative measure of growth used by many economists is that the economy expanded by 3.1 percent in 2018. The Fed dramatically changed direction this year as growth in China and Europe weakened and the government partially shut down. On Wednesday, the vast majority of Fed leaders indicated that they do not foresee rate hikes this year. It was a big change from December, when many Fed leaders anticipated two more hikes in 2019. \"Growth is slowing somewhat more than expected,\u201d Powell said Wednesday as the Fed cut its growth forecast down to 2.1 percent for this year. Powell has remained stoic in the face of Trump\u2019s criticism. He has repeatedly declined to comment on the president but has defended the Fed and its nonpartisan decision-making. He has also forged close ties with members of both parties in Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that the public understand that we are always going to make a decision based on what we think is right for the American people,\u201d Powell said in a recent interview on the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d A number of economists expressed shock that Moore could soon be on the Fed board, which can have as many as seven members. \u201cThis is the first genuinely bad Trump pick for the Fed,\u201d tweeted Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t gotten a thing right in twenty years, (check the record), and the Senate should not confirm him.\u201d Moore has flip-flopped on his views about the Fed since Trump was elected. When Barack Obama was in office and the country was trying to climb out of the Great Recession, Moore called for tighter monetary policy because he feared hyperinflation from the Fed\u2019s low interest rates at the time. Once Trump took office, Moore began calling for lower interest rate. The Fed has interest rates at a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent, the highest level in a decade, but low by historical standards. Moore has argued that the economy is experiencing deflation, in which prices fall, but the Commerce Department\u2019s inflation metrics show that prices are rising about 1.5 percent a year. He has also called for the Fed to try to intervene to keep commodity prices such as soybeans more stable, even though soybean prices fell sharply last year largely because of Trump\u2019s trade war with China. If confirmed, Moore would not be able to single-handedly lower interest rates or change other Fed policies. Major Fed decisions are made by a committee of up to 12 members \u2014 the seven governors nominated by the White House and five heads of regional Fed banks who are chosen by those communities. \u201cOne voice does not determine Fed decisions,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.","65":"In his first two years in office, President Trump has largely underperformed the even modest expectations that Americans had for him as he took office in January 2017, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. The new assessment of Trump, which measures his public standing across 10 major issues and character traits, comes as his overall job-approval rating languishes at 37\u00a0percent, one point above his record low in August and at two previous points. Nearly 6 in 10 say they have an unfavorable view of the president as a person. Similar majorities say they doubt his empathy, honesty and ability to make political deals, although on several of those attitudes, his ratings have not changed significantly during his time in office. As he begins the second half of his first term, Trump has suffered one of the most significant defeats of his presidency, having capitulated to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and other congressional Democrats in a standoff over building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 a dispute that brought about the longest U.S. government shutdown in history. The survey was completed before Trump agreed to reopen the government without a commitment to fund a border wall, which he has championed since he was a candidate. Those negotiations will continue over the next three weeks. Trump\u2019s failed gamble that he could force Democrats to blink first has caused dismay among many congressional Republicans and threatens to call into question the president\u2019s oft-stated claim of being an effective dealmaker. A 57\u00a0percent majority rates Trump negatively for his handling of border security, the signature issue on which he began his campaign. That is similar to the 54\u00a0percent who oppose building a wall, which he insists is necessary to stem a \u201cgrowing humanitarian and security crisis\u201d at the southern border. The good news for Trump is that his opponents are not popular, either. The survey shows that just 35\u00a0percent of Americans say they have confidence in the president to make the right decisions for the country\u2019s future. But just 34\u00a0percent say that of Democrats in Congress, 30\u00a0percent for Republicans in Congress and 30\u00a0percent for Pelosi. The depth of the doubts about Trump\u2019s capacity to make good future decisions, however, is greater than it is for Pelosi, congressional Democrats or congressional Republicans. Almost half of all Americans (48\u00a0percent) say they have no confidence in Trump\u2019s future decision-making. For Pelosi, that number was 37\u00a0percent. For congressional Democrats and Republicans, about 3 in 10 give each the lowest level of confidence. On economic issues, Americans had high expectations about the ability of the New York businessman and builder to handle an economy that was growing steadily, if slowly, after the financial crash a decade earlier. In the intervening two years, the pace of economic growth has increased and the unemployment rate has dropped even lower, both in part because of the big tax-cut bill that Republicans approved and the president signed. The stock market, after a strong rise during much of the first two years of Trump\u2019s presidency, has recently experienced a sharp drop and volatility amid doubts about the future. To the American people, that record adds up to lowered ratings for the president since his inauguration. At that time, about 6 in 10 Americans expected him to perform well on these fronts. Today, the public is divided evenly, with 49\u00a0percent giving him positive marks on his handling of the economy and 49\u00a0percent giving him negative marks. Even those most optimistic or pessimistic are split evenly, with 27\u00a0percent saying his handling has been \u201cexcellent\u201d and 27\u00a0percent saying it has been \u201cpoor.\u201d The starkest gap between Trump\u2019s current ratings and Americans\u2019 initially positive expectations is on the federal deficit. Two years ago, 50\u00a0percent of Americans thought Trump would do an excellent or good job handling the deficit. The new poll finds 33\u00a0percent saying he has done well, a 17-point drop that occurred across party lines. Notably, many Republicans have shifted in their views. Two years ago, 87\u00a0percent of Republicans said they expected him to deal with the deficit effectively. Today, 67\u00a0percent of that group think he has done that. Among independents, the number who say he would effectively tackle the deficit has dropped from 52\u00a0percent to 27\u00a0percent. Another issue where Trump has performed below initial expectations is health care, where his positive ratings have fallen from 44\u00a0percent to 33\u00a0percent. The sharpest falloff came among independents, from 48\u00a0percent saying they expected him to do a good job with the issue to 22\u00a0percent. When Trump came into office, he and Republicans promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but those aspirations eventually died in Congress. Along with the deficit and health care, Americans grade Trump the worst on issues dealing with women and race relations, both areas in which the president started with low expectations. About one-third say he has done an excellent or good job on each in his first two years, with more than 6 in 10 adults calling his performance poor or not so good. Americans\u2019 ratings of Trump\u2019s handling of international crises are also more in line with expectations at the time of his inauguration, with 43\u00a0percent saying he has done an excellent or good job , similar to 44\u00a0percent who expected him to do so two years ago. Trump\u2019s performance in responding to terrorism was slightly worse, people said. A 56 percent majority had expected him to be successful, but a slightly lower 50 percent rate his performance positively after two years. Trump receives lower marks as a person than as a president, with 1 in 3 Americans saying they have a favorable impression of him \u201cas a person.\u201d On attributes, Americans were least likely to say Trump understands problems of people like them or is \u201chonest and trustworthy\u201d but they were closely divided on whether he is a strong leader. On attributes relating to the conduct of a president, majorities say Trump does not have the personality or temperament to be president, and is not an effective political dealmaker. Nor do they think he has fulfilled a basic campaign promise, with a majority saying he has not brought needed change to Washington. On the economy, the drop to Trump\u2019s current ratings was largest among political independents. Two-thirds (67\u00a0percent) had hoped for a good performance but just under half said he did a good job, a decrease of 18\u00a0percentage points. The perceptions of Trump vary across demographic and regional lines. Both white and nonwhite people rated Trump\u2019s economic performance lower than they had expected, with similar declines. But a majority of whites, 58\u00a0percent, approve of his economic performance while only a third of nonwhite Americans gave him good or excellent grades on the economy. On a question of how well Trump would handle issues with special concern for women, Trump\u2019s overall rating has declined only a bit, from 37\u00a0percent positive to 33\u00a0percent positive. Among men, there has been no change in two years. Among women, Trump\u2019s positive rating on this question fell from 33 percent to 23 percent. Regionally, dissatisfaction with the economy was greatest in the West, where 58\u00a0percent of people had expected success but only 40\u00a0percent say Trump did well. The South had held the highest expectations when Trump began, with two-thirds optimistic (66\u00a0percent), but just over half now approve of his performance. The Midwest showed the least disappointment, dropping only five percentage points, to 54\u00a0percent approval. Disappointment with Trump\u2019s help for the middle class was strongest among households with lower incomes. When he took office, about half of families of all incomes expected him to have success in helping the middle class. But after two years, one-third of households making less than $50,000 thought he was doing succeeding, while 43\u00a0percent of higher-income households gave him a thumbs-up. The Post-ABC poll was conducted by telephone Jan. 21-24 among a random national sample of 1,001 adults, with 65\u00a0percent reached on cellphones and 35\u00a0percent on landlines. Overall results have a 3.5 percentage-point margin of sampling error for the full sample. The error margin is 5-5.5 points for questions asked of a half-sample of respondents.","66":"Seth Rollins wins men\u2019s Royal Rumble match, earns championship match at WrestleMania: After emerging from the rubble of the broken announce table, Rollins clawed his way back into the ring and eventually found himself on the apron with Braun Strowman, the 6-foot-8, 385-pounder nicknamed the \u201cMonster Among Men.\u201d Rollins hit Strowman with a stomp to the back of the head, sending him out of the ring. In light of Roman Reigns taking time off to receive treatment for leukemia, Rollins has stepped into the role of WWE\u2019s top good guy in recent months. The Rumble win officially christens him a main eventer and sets up a likely WrestleMania match with WWE Universal Champion Brock Lesnar. Nia Jax becomes fourth woman in history to enter men\u2019s Royal Rumble: After coming in third place in the women\u2019s Royal Rumble, Nia Jax unleashed a surprise attack on R-Truth, the final entrant into tonight\u2019s contest. Jax proceeded to enter the ring and eliminate fan favorite Mustafa Ali. Jax is the fourth woman to compete in the men\u2019s Rumble match, following in the foosteps of the late Chyna, Beth Phoenix and Kharma. Jax then had a staredown with Randy Orton, eventually falling victim to an RKO. Bobby Lashley slams Seth Rollins through announce table: WWE Intercontinental champion Bobby Lashley was eliminated moments after entering the Royal Rumble, and he took his frustration out on Seth Rollins. Lashley pulled Rollins out of the ring from underneath the ropes and slammed him through an announce table, leaving Rollins knocked out. Expect Rollins to make a heroic comeback late in the match. Kofi Kingston narrowly avoids elimination, but the victory is short-lived: Kofi Kingston has been a mainstay in the Royal Rumble for the past decade, each year displaying a new, creative way to avoid elimination. Entering as this year\u2019s 12th participant, Kingston was thrown over the top rope by Dean Ambrose, but refrained from letting both of his feet touch the floor. He pinned his feet to the side apron, twisting his body until he reached the stairs. His tenure was short-lived, though, as he was soon eliminated by Drew McIntyre. Elias duets with WWE Hall of Famer Jeff Jarrett, then eliminates him: Elias was the first entrant in the Royal Rumble and intended to take the opportunity to serenade the crowd with a song \u2014 until he was interrupted by the No. 2 entrant, WWE Hall of Famer Jeff Jarrett. The veteran, known for his musical talents in his prime, proposed a duet with Elias. The Chase Field crowd ate it up, until Elias spoiled the fun by punching Jarrett in the face before eliminating him. Brock Lesnar overcomes valiant effort from challenger Finn Balor to retain WWE Universal Championship: In a match that was billed as a modern day \u201cDavid vs. Goliath\u201d the diminutive Finn Balor put up a fight against the 6-foot-3, 286-pound Brock Lesnar. Balor, who held the Universal Title for one day in 2016 but relinquished it because of a real-life injury, hit Lesnar with his Coup de Grace finisher from the top rope. Before the referee could count to three, Lesnar flipped the pin into a kimura and made Balor tap out. Daniel Bryan retains WWE Championship over AJ Styles thanks to interference from Rowan: It\u2019s hard to follow a Royal Rumble match, given the energy live crowds expend during it. AJ Styles and Daniel Bryan, two of the most respected wrestlers in the world, did their best, producing a fun bout full of chain wrestling, submissions and high-flying. In the end, Bryan retained after surprise interference from Rowan, who had not been seen on television for months. Becky Lynch eliminates rival Charlotte Flair to win Royal Rumble, punches ticket to WrestleMania: Fittingly, the final two came down to Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair, former best friends turned enemies. The basis of the duo\u2019s feud in late 2018 was that Charlotte had always stuck her nose in Lynch\u2019s business, stealing opportunities from her. Lynch, after getting beat up on the outside by Nia Jax, hobbled back into the ring Sunday on one knee and shouted at Flair: \u201cYou\u2019re not taking this from me!\u201d Indeed, Lynch sent Flair over the top rope, punching her to the ground and basking in the moment of her Rumble victory. With the win, Lynch can choose to challenge Raw Women's Champion Ronda Rousey or Smackdown Women's Champion Asuka at WrestleMania. Lynch vs. Rousey has been the rumored match for months, and the build for the bout should begin on WWE TV this week. Becky Lynch replaces Lana in Royal Rumble: With Lana unable to compete due to the injury she suffered during her husband Rusev\u2019s match during the pre-show, Becky Lynch stormed the entrance and convinced a WWE official to let her enter the match as the last competitor. Chase Field serenaded her with chants of \u201cBecky! Becky! Becky!\u201d With all 30 entrants having entered the match, the contest is down to its final five competitors \u2014 Carmella, Nia Jax, Bayley, Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch. Alexa Bliss enters Royal Rumble, makes first in-ring appearance since September: The multi-time champion hadn\u2019t competed since September after suffering a concussion. The injury forced her to miss October\u2019s Evolution, WWE\u2019s first all-women\u2019s pay-per view event. When her music hit Sunday, the Chase Field crowd exploded. Mandy Rose spoils rival Naomi\u2019s jaw-dropping feat of athleticism: Naomi eliminated Mandy Rose soon after entering the women\u2019s Royal Rumble match. Rose, who in story line attempted to break up Naomi\u2019s marriage with husband Jimmy Uso, attempted to powerbomb Naomi to the ground from the outside. But Naomi placed her feet on the barricade to remain alive in the Rumble. (Competitors are only eliminated once thrown over the top rope and both of their feet touch the floor.) Naomi toed the barricade, keeping her balance, before leaping onto the steps, avoiding elimination. But then Rose pulled Naomi to the floor to the dismay of the crowd. Ronda Rousey outlasts Sasha Banks: In an entertaining match that might\u2019ve been the best of Ronda Rousey\u2019s young career, the RAW Women\u2019s Champion pinned Sasha Banks after hitting her opponent with her Piper\u2019s Pit finisher and retained her title. Banks was one of the women\u2019s division\u2019s biggest stars before Rousey\u2019s arrival but had been written out of the spotlight over the past year. She proved an apt foe for Rousey on Sunday, nearly tapping Rousey out on several occasions. But Rousey, now WWE\u2019s biggest name, is destined to enter WrestleMania with the championship around her waist. After the match, Banks shook Rousey\u2019s hand, seemingly burying the hatchet, but then threw up the \u201cFour Horsewomen\u201d symbol, a nod to her longtime friendship with Becky Lynch, Charlotte Flair and Bailey. Rousey\u2019s a member of her own \u201cFour Horsewomen\u201d group that includes fellow former MMA fighters turned WWE performers Shayna Baszler, Jessamyn Duke and Marina Shafir. Rumors of the eight women squaring off have percolated for some time. The Miz and Shane McMahon knock off The Bar to capture the WWE Smackdown Tag Team Championships: The odd couple team of The Miz and Shane McMahon came together to dethrone The Bar, with Shane hitting a shooting star press on Cesaro for the win. In the story line, The Miz convinced Shane to team with him after bringing up how he never lived up to his father\u2019s expectations. The message resonated with the son of Vince McMahon. This seems likely to lead to a breakup and blood feud, given Miz\u2019s reputation for chicanery, but for now, the unlikely pairing got their moment to shine. Asuka taps out \u201cThe Man\u201d Becky Lynch: No one quite resonates with WWE fans like Becky Lynch, who opened Sunday\u2019s event with a Smackdown Women\u2019s Championship match against Asuka. Lynch, in a rare moment of fallibility, came up short, tapping out to a modification of the champion\u2019s eponymously named Asuka Lock, capping what had been an exciting start to the show. Fans of Lynch mustn't worry. The loss to Asuka sets her up to enter the women's Royal Rumble match later in the show, and a Rumble win could set up the WrestleMania bout against Raw Women's Champion Ronda Rousey that has been rumored for months. WWE takes advantage of NFL\u2019s bad press, announces match for halftime of Super Bowl: WWE Chairman and CEO Vince McMahon\u2019s revived professional football league, the XFL, isn\u2019t set to kick off until 2020, but McMahon is already aiming to pull viewers from the NFL. During the Royal Rumble pre-show, WWE legend Shawn Michaels announced that stars from NXT, WWE\u2019s development league, would compete in a match during halftime of next Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl. The halftime show has been a point of contention, with several musicians bowing out in support of former San Francisco 49ers Colin Kaepernick\u2019s protest of police brutality. (Maroon 5 ultimately agreed to take the stage.) In a shrewd move that speaks to the company\u2019s confidence in their stars of the future, WWE scheduled a six-man tag match pitting Velveteen Dream, Aleister Black and King Ricochet against Tommasso Ciampa, Johnny Gargano and Adam Cole to be streamed on the WWE Network. Buddy Murphy fends off Kalisto, Akira Tozawa and Hideo Itami to retain WWE Cruiserweight Championship: In the pre-show\u2019s final match, Murphy fended off the highflying, aerial offense of his three competitors, capturing the win after knocking Itami with a series of stiff knees and his Murphy\u2019s Law finishing move. Murphy, the real-life fiance of popular WWE performer Alexa Bliss, has now held the title since Oct. 6, when he beat former champion Cedric Alexander in his native Australia. Shinsuke Nakamura reclaims United States championship from Rusev: Rusev\u2019s championship victory over Nakamura on the Dec. 25 episode of Smackdown Live was a feel good moment for fans of the \u201cBulgarian Brute.\u201d Rusev has built a dedicated following thanks in part to his humorous social media persona, and his win was seen as a long overdue vote of confidence from WWE. His reign was short-lived, however, with Nakamura gaining the win after Rusev accidentally knocked his wife, Lana, off the apron (the portion of the mat outside of the ropes). Distracted by Lana\u2019s condition, Rusev was kneed in the back of the neck by Nakamura, who won last year\u2019s men\u2019s Royal Rumble match. Raw Tag Team champions Bobby Roode and Chad Gable claim victory over makeshift team: Curmudgeonly wrestling fans say Roode and Gable are underutilized and underappreciated by WWE\u2019s writing staff, but the team stood tall in the first match of the pre-show. Rood and Gable beat the makeshift team of Rezar (of tag team Authors of Pain) and Scott Dawson (of the Revival). The stipulation was that, if Rezar and Dawson won, each of their teams would earn championship opportunities. It wasn\u2019t to be, as Gable pinned Dawson after executing a moonsault. The Raw tag team division is in desperate need of excitement, but this match did little in the way of moving toward that goal. Popular culture normally thumbs its nose at professional wrestling, only paying mind to moments featuring recognizable faces, like former UFC star Ronda Rousey\u2019s in-ring debut at WrestleMania 34, or the goofiest of stunts, like Vince McMahon\u2019s strut. The cartoonish gait of WWE\u2019s CEO has found a place in today\u2019s meme-obsessed culture, and for good reason: McMahon\u2019s flailing arms, swaggering legs and evil smile suggest a caricature of an ornery, know-it-all tycoon. It\u2019s at once humorous, ironic and familiar. Nearly six weeks before Sunday\u2019s Royal Rumble at Chase Field in Phoenix, McMahon walked toward the ring on \u201cMonday Night Raw\u201d for the first time in nearly a year, his normally exaggerated mannerisms noticeably toned down. McMahon, 73, is rarely seen on television these days. But Raw had recorded all-time lows in viewership two weeks in a row, and rumors of the first threat to his family\u2019s wrestling monopoly in two decades were starting to gain steam. (In early January, Tony and Shad Khan, co-owners of the Jacksonville Jaguars, announced the formation of the upstart All Elite Wrestling promotion.) McMahon on that December night was joined in the ring by his son, Shane; his daughter, Stephanie; and her husband, Paul Levesque. In a speech that blurred the lines between story line and reality, the first family of WWE acknowledged that they hadn\u2019t been doing a very good job and promised things were going to change, immediately. Contrived as it was, the message behind the speech was well-received by hardcore wrestling fans long frustrated by stale writing. And the timing was right, with Royal Rumble around the corner. That event annually serves as the first stop on the road to April\u2019s WrestleMania \u2014 WWE\u2019s biggest event of the year. The weeks since the McMahons\u2019 announcement produced more compelling television, and not just because of the specter of the women\u2019s and men\u2019s Rumble matches, which each pit 30 wrestlers in a battle royal, vying for the opportunity to challenge the champion of their choosing at WrestleMania. Raw, and its sister program, Smackdown Live, popped with more inspired writing and fresh faces. It didn\u2019t hurt that the McMahons were inserted into story lines: Levesque, also known as Triple H, dared Seth Rollins, his former on-screen protege and a popular men\u2019s Rumble winner pick, to show his more ruthless side. McMahon did the same with AJ Styles, prodding him to unleash his inner \u201cbulldog.\u201d Styles will challenge Daniel Bryan, the former fan favorite turned righteous villain, for the WWE championship at Sunday\u2019s event. WWE Universal Champion Brock Lesnar, another former UFC star, will defend his title against the diminutive Finn Balor in a bout billed in the vein of David vs. Goliath. But it\u2019s on the women\u2019s side where most of the intrigue lies. For months, Rousey has been mired in dueling conflicts with Charlotte Flair and the ascendant Becky Lynch, who emerged as the company\u2019s biggest star toward the end of 2018. The three have been rumored to be competing in a triple-threat match at WrestleMania, and the requisite pieces of the puzzle should come into place at Rumble. Rousey is expected to retain her Raw Women\u2019s Championship over Sasha Banks, while Flair will compete in the women\u2019s Rumble match. Lynch will challenge Asuka, the women\u2019s champion on the Smackdown brand, on Sunday, but she\u2019s likely to find her way over to the Raw brand soon, where she could continue her spats with Rousey and Flair in earnest. To be sure, WWE\u2019s grip on the professional wrestling world will not loosen anytime soon. McMahon has built a global company whose stock price hovers around $82 per share. The advent of AEW is exciting for wrestling fans, but that the McMahons have dominated the industry for so long is no accident. Not surprisingly, ratings have stabilized since the family\u2019s return to television. But for the first time since 2001, when McMahon purchased Ted Turner\u2019s World Championship Wrestling promotion, competition is imminent. WrestleMania season, starting with the Royal Rumble, is WWE\u2019s chance to flex its muscles, to spotlight its most inspiring performers in front of more eyeballs than usual. It\u2019s more important the promotion gets it right this year than it has been in a long, long time. When: Sunday, 7 p.m. Eastern. Location: Chase Field, Phoenix.

Key fights: ","67":"Rating:     The title of \u201cNever Look Away\u201d is deliciously ironic: This is one of the most mesmerizing, compulsively watchable films in theaters right now. Written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck \u2014 best known for his masterful 2006 drama \u201cThe Lives of Others\u201d \u2014 this meditation on art, memory and meaning is yet another deep-dive into the postwar psyche of the filmmaker\u2019s native Germany. In \u201cThe Lives of Others,\u201d the narrative foils were an East Berlin Stasi agent and the subjects of his political-but-also-personal prying. Here, Donnersmarck considers the life and early career of painter Gerhard Richter, whose autobiography and subject matter have intersected with the most seismic dislocations of 20th-century Germany to a confounding and occasionally breathtakingly coincidental degree. \u201cNever Look Away\u201d is one degree removed from the literal Richter: The film\u2019s protagonist, Kurt Barnert, will be recognizable from the details of his life, aesthetic sensibility and development into one of the most important artists of his time. That artistic license \u2014 the decision to make Richter clearly legible but slightly off-plumb \u2014 is altogether appropriate for someone whose stock in trade has been paintings of dazzling photorealism, often disrupted by a subtly blurring brushstroke. In \u201cNever Look Away\u201d we meet the young Kurt (played in a quietly watchful performance by Cai Cohrs) as he is being led through 1937\u2019s notorious \u201cdegenerate art\u201d exhibition as it travels to Dresden. Captivated by the paintings of Otto Dix, Franz Marc and others, he\u2019s told by a docent that such nihilistic, self-indulgent art has no place in Nazi Germany. Meanwhile, Kurt\u2019s beloved Aunt Elisabeth (Saskia Rosendahl), who has brought her nephew to the museum, whispers conspiratorially that she prefers the verboten moderns to the sentimental romanticism sanctioned by the Reich. Thus, Kurt embarks on a journey of dualities that will haunt him throughout a war \u2014 one in which he observes U.S. bombers with awe, even as they destroy his hometown; that will force his father to join the Nazi party, even though he can\u2019t bring himself to say, \u201cHeil, Hitler\u201d; and in which his family members will be killed by both sides. When Kurt apprentices as a sign painter and attends art school \u2014 where his superb draftsmanship makes him the envy of his peers \u2014 the National Socialist strictures of realism and uplift are replaced by Communist ones. The drama of \u201cNever Look Away\u201d resides in how Kurt will process the traumas and unspoken betrayals of his past into a formal language that feels personal, new and urgent, and that can accommodate intuition and indictment in equal measure. Portrayed as a young man by Tom Schilling, Kurt is something of a cipher throughout a movie that spans three decades and includes an amusing depiction of Dusseldorf\u2019s famous Kunstakademie, where, by the late 1960s, representational painting has given way to conceptual \u201chappenings\u201d and where, in one memorable and gorgeously designed scene, the Joseph Beuys-like Antonius van Verten (Oliver Masucci) sets political posters on fire in front of a bemused class. But \u201cNever Look Away\u201d is also powered by a mystery in the form of a physician named Carl Seeband (Sebastian Koch), whose role in Kurt\u2019s life emerges in steadily more surprising ways. As with \u201cThe Lives of Others,\u201d Donnersmarck exhibits smoothly authoritative control over material that, in other hands, might be unwieldy or unforgivably pat. \u201cNever Look Away\u201d is episodic, but the episodes are executed with the meticulous care of a gem-cutter working with the lambent facets of a precious stone. Cinematographer Caleb Deschanel has been justifiably nominated for an Oscar for his magnificent photography, which echoes Richter\u2019s alternately soft-edged and exactingly precise style. Working with a refined, muted color palette that gradually gives way to vibrant swaths of teal, the filmmakers create a lush evocation, not just of a period, but of an emerging and increasingly insistent inner life. Once the catharsis comes in \u201cNever Look Away\u201d \u2014 once Kurt instinctively acts out on his youthful certitude that everything is connected \u2014 the effect is thrilling. Rarely has the act of someone simply putting paint to canvas elicited such visceral emotion. By then, what\u2019s at stake isn\u2019t a gifted artist\u2019s career or creative prowes. It\u2019s nothing short of a moral reckoning. \u201cNever Look Away\u201d begins as the evolution of a style. But in its sweep and finely tuned focus, it chronicles the emergence of a self \u2014 fully realized and finally capable of wresting meaning from a random, cruel and stubbornly unresolved history.

Fake news \u2014 intentionally misleading misinformation dressed up like legitimate news \u2014 has probably become a permanent feature of our politics. Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats recently warned that America\u2019s adversaries will \u201calmost certainly\u201d use online influence operations to try to weaken our democratic institutions. But the problem of digitally disseminated disinformation is not limited to the political sphere. It poses a threat to corporations, too. Fake news threatens the boardroom as well as the voting booth. What today is called \u201cfake news\u201d is a timeworn tactic of using information as a weapon to achieve a larger objective. For example, we now know that the Soviets actively worked to undermine political leaders in the United States throughout the Cold War, even crafting phony FBI reports in the 1970s suggesting that prominent anti-communist Sen. Henry \u201cScoop\u201d Jackson was secretly gay. Today, the threat of fake news comes from at least three categories of actors capable of spreading disinformation far more efficiently than most people anticipated in the 20th century. The first group, trolls, is motivated not by profit but by spite or dogma to harm specific corporations. In August 2017, for instance, someone on the anonymous online message board 4 Chan said he wanted to inflict pain on a \u201cliberal place\u201d and cooked up a campaign against Starbucks, posting bogus tweets that advertised \u201cDreamer Day,\u201d when the coffee chain would supposedly give out free drinks to undocumented immigrants. The Seattle-based company had to move quickly to counter seemingly legitimate social media advertisements that carried the hashtag \u201c#borderfreecoffee\u201d and were adorned with the company\u2019s logo, signature font and graphics. Other recent lies held that Coca-Cola was recalling Dasani bottled water because it had been infested by \u201cclear parasites,\u201d that an Xbox console killed a teenager, that Costco was ending its membership program and that British pub chain JD Wetherspoon had banned staff from wearing Remembrance Day poppies because of the \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d of its clientele and employees. Some prank websites with names like Channel23News allow users to create their own genuine-looking fake-news articles and post them directly to social media, lowering the cost of entry for propagandists and subjecting even small businesses to such dangers. After one such site produced an article falsely accusing a London Indian restaurant of serving human meat, the business said its revenue dropped by half. It was one of at least six Indian and Asian restaurants in Britain targeted by similar counterfeits. The second group, profiteers, seeks financial advantage from a well-calibrated con. While corporate America has long experience with traditional \u201cpump and dump\u201d schemes \u2014 in which traders unscrupulously promote a stock and then sell it quickly to benefit from the price change \u2014 profiteers can use fake tweets and news releases to boost stock prices with relative ease. In November 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it had \u201cfiled securities fraud charges against a Scottish trader whose false tweets caused sharp drops in the stock prices of two companies,\u201d a semiconductor manufacturer and a medical research firm. In another case, a Canadian couple used their website and social media accounts to inflate the stock of companies with small capitalizations and then pocketed $2.4 million by selling shares of those companies. And in 2014, the SEC charged two men with issuing false, rapid-fire news releases hyping a small biotech firm and causing its stock price to balloon eight-fold in a month.  Fake news releases and social media posts threaten to be all the more influential on markets now that many investment firms rely on algorithms to scour press releases to inform trading decisions. Profiteers can benefit whether a stock rises or falls because of false information. In one example, in 2015 a website designed to resemble Bloomberg.com, with a similar-looking web address (\u201cbloomberg.market\u201d), published a phony story that Twitter had received a $31 billion takeover bid, sending shares surging \u2014 presumably for the benefit of whoever prepared the trick. And in October 2018, a few months after Broadcom announced its intention to acquire CA Technologies for $19 billion, a memo circulated online, supposedly from the Defense Department, saying that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign investments for national security risks, would scrutinize the acquisition. The shares of both companies dropped before the markets realized the letter was a fake. It is not known who authored the memo, but short sellers could have reaped a windfall from this legerdemain, which one writer called \u201ca new phase of short-seller espionage.\u201d The third group, foreign flags, is strictly theoretical at this point. But rival powers and state-backed groups could target private companies with fake news, and it may be merely a matter of time until they do. Imagine a foreign cyberoperation attacking the reputation of a U.S. company with a disinformation campaign to damage its brand and induce business to a foreign company instead. What might Russian cyberspies do, say, to help Gazprom win a close bidding war against Western energy companies for oil exploration rights in a developing nation? What might Chinese propagandists do to spread rumors about alleged weaknesses in American microprocessors? To preempt and eventually overcome these threats, a corporation needs communications and litigation strategies \u2014 it needs to be ready to respond to incidents online, through the press and even in the courtroom.  Companies should plan for these events, assign roles and responsibilities to senior managers, and conduct simulations like the ones they run for cybersecurity breaches. Companies also need to stay abreast of what is being said about them online and communicate regularly with customers and business partners to build confidence, so those partners will know whom to trust in the face of false information. Finally, while free speech rights protect opinion, corporations have legal recourse, particularly when third parties benefit from spreading lies. State and federal laws bar many kinds of online hoaxes. Statutes prohibiting defamation, interference with future business and trademark theft, among others, can all be used to vindicate the rights of fake-news victims. It is no small irony that corporate America is sometimes imperiled by the free flow of information that it cultivates and benefits from. Like the nation\u2019s political institutions, businesses must learn to combat, mitigate and ignore such threats in some combination for the foreseeable future. The honest truth is that while fake news may seem like a purely political problem unique to our current circumstances, successful malevolence breeds imitation.

Tim Scott (R-S.C.) \u2014 the lone black Republican senator, who has previously criticized Trump on race issues \u2014 Pence assured local faith and business leaders that the administration is committed to bolstering development in places such as Columbia, where a shuttered movie theater was reopened last month as part of the \u201copportunity zone\u201d program. \u201cYou\u2019re all coming back,\u201d Pence said before a crowd of about 100 people at the Meeting Place Church of Greater Columbia, a predominantly African American congregation that owns the nearby movie theater property. Pence also heaped praise on Scott, who in 2017 called Trump\u2019s response to the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville \u201csterile\u201d and met privately with the president at the White House to discuss his concerns. Pence told the crowd that Trump spoke with him and Scott by phone as they traveled to the church, and Pence said he has had a \u201cbond\u201d with Scott going back to their first meeting years ago when Scott was a state lawmaker. They later overlapped in the House and became friends, Pence said. \u201cI was for Tim Scott before it was cool,\u201d Pence said. Pence\u2019s efforts here went beyond overtures to Scott. In his speech, he spoke admiringly of Black History Month. Wearing a red, South Carolina-themed tie, Pence talked with a small group of African American officials and pastors. During the church tour, he and his wife, Karen, huddled with a group of gospel singers, who gave the couple an impromptu and enthusiastic vocal performance of a song called \u201cGreat Is Your Mercy.\u201d \u201cBeautiful,\u201d Pence told them afterward. Scott did not acknowledge his past tensions with the administration as he and Pence toured the church and appeared together onstage and at a business roundtable. Instead, he focused on his advocacy for opportunity zones. \u201cThere are places in our nation where the recovery has been uneven,\u201d Scott said. Pence\u2019s upbeat pitch Thursday was in line with recent speeches he has made, selling the Trump administration\u2019s policies to audiences who are skeptical or outright hostile, such as at last week\u2019s annual Munich Security Conference, which brought together many U.S. allies in Europe who are wary of the administration\u2019s approach to foreign policy. Pence\u2019s remarks there were met with a cool response as he spoke of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d worldview. Opportunity zones, a provision in the tax cut bill, have been viewed skeptically by some economists. Investors who pour money into one of the 8,000-plus zones nationwide receive a tax break on capital gains, but it is debatable whether that break is necessary or even helpful in certain areas. \u201cSome high-profile zones were poorly chosen, raising the risk of subsidizing places that are already on a stable footing,\u201d Jared Bernstein, a former economist in the Obama administration, wrote last month in The Washington Post. Many Wall Street firms, buoyed by stock market gains over the past year, have expressed enthusiasm about the provision as a means of expanding their footprint into new cities and towns with enticing tax benefits, all while polishing their image. Trump administration officials have said further guidance and rules for the program will be unveiled in the coming months. Scott was one of the provision\u2019s main proponents during negotiations and urged both Democratic and Republican lawmakers to support the proposal, working closely with Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, a senior adviser to her father. Opportunity zones are a variation of a longtime GOP idea of offering investors targeted tax breaks to woo businesses to poor communities. The late Republican congressman Jack Kemp (N.Y.) promoted \u201centerprise zones\u201d for decades in Congress, and others, from former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), have offered similar plans in recent years. Pence mentioned Kemp in his remarks at the church and later at the business roundtable meeting, calling him a \u201cmentor.\u201d Kemp was also known for calling on Republicans to make inroads with minority communities by underscoring entrepreneurship and economic growth. Democratic presidential candidates sharply criticized Trump\u2019s economic policies this week and argued that the administration has neglected poor and minority Americans with its sweeping tax law. Some 2020 hopefuls also have called Trump racist, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who launched his latest bid for the White House on Tuesday. South Carolina is likely to be a political battleground next year despite its GOP leanings. The state\u2019s 1st Congressional District, now represented by Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.), is already a target for national Republicans as they attempt to win back the House, following Cunningham\u2019s victory last year in a traditionally Republican district. Former state Democratic Party chairman Jaime Harrison announced in early February that he is exploring a bid against Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Graham is up for reelection in 2020 and is one of Trump\u2019s highest-profile allies. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other top Democrats have encouraged Harrison to run. Harrison said in an interview this week that the Trump administration could face new vulnerabilities in this ruby-red state because of its trade and economic policies. \u201cI hope local business folks and farmers affected by the tariffs get a chance to complain about how they\u2019re crippling business in South Carolina when the vice president visits,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to get business to come here and our representatives in the Senate aren\u2019t pushing back at all. They\u2019re more interested in getting tee time with the president.\u201d","70":"\u201cThe Walton family makes more money in one minute than Walmart workers do in an entire year. This is what we mean when we talk about a rigged economy.\u201d  \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), in a tweet, Feb. 14, 2019 This tweet from the campaign Twitter account of Sanders, a potential 2020 presidential candidate, caught our eye. Whether this is a definition of a rigged economy is a matter of opinion, but we were curious whether his factoid was right \u2014 does the Walton family make as much money in a minute as the company\u2019s workers make in a year? Let\u2019s take a look. The Sanders campaign acknowledged that the information in the tweet came from a union-backed website known as Making Change at Walmart. The math behind this factoid is pretty simple and easily confirmed with documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Though Walmart is a publicly traded company, more than 50 percent of its shares are in the hands of the Walton family \u2014 51.11 percent, to be precise. These shares are controlled primarily through two entities: Walton Family Holdings Trust and a holding company, Walton Enterprises. Members of the Walton family also have shares they control individually. The three most prominent members of the family are Jim, S. Robson (Rob) and Alice, each estimated to be worth about $46 billion. They are the surviving children of Sam Walton, co-founder of the company. Other members of the family include Ann Walton Kroenke and Nancy Walton Laurie, children of Bud Walton, the other co-founder; Christy Walton, the widow of one of Sam\u2019s sons; and 10 grandchildren (such as Lukas, worth about $16 billion, and Steuart, who is on the company\u2019s board of directors). When you add it up, the Walton family controls 1,508,965,874 shares out of 2,952,478,528 total shares outstanding, according to the company\u2019s 2018 proxy statement. Walmart\u2019s most recent quarterly dividend was 52 cents a share, or $2.08 a year. In other words, the Walton family earns $3,138,649,017.92 just in dividends a year, before adding in income from salaries, director\u2019s fees and so forth. Yep, that\u2019s more than $3.1 billion. We have no idea how many hours a week members of the Walton family work on business, but a standard workweek is 40 hours, or 2,080 hours a year. That works out to $1.51 million an hour \u2014 or more precisely, $25,149 a minute. By contrast, the union-backed website says, \u201cat $9\/hour, Walmart workers make less than $16,000\/year working 34 hours per week, which is Walmart\u2019s definition of full-time.\u201d Payscale says the average Walmart wage is $12 an hour, including managers, with cashiers earning $9.97 and sales associates earning $10.40. Walmart has previously told The Fact Checker that an entry-level worker earns $11 an hour. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s give these workers a 40-hour week. Walmart considers 34 hours full-time, which means that\u2019s when workers can qualify for extra benefits, but under the law it has to start paying overtime when work exceeds 40 hours in a week. During holiday seasons, Walmart has been giving extra hours to existing workers rather than hiring seasonal workers. So a 40-hour week seems reasonable as a baseline. Cashiers: $20,738 a year Sales associates: $21,632 a year Entry-level worker (Walmart figure): $22,880 a year Walmart average (Payscale): $24,960 year Walton family: $25,149 a minute Even under a 40-hour metric, the Walton family still earns more in a minute than Walmart employees do in a year. While the Walmart workers making $20,000 to $25,000 a year may pay little in income taxes or even qualify for the earned income tax credit, we should note that dividend income is taxed at a much lower rate than ordinary income. (This lower tax rate applies to \u201cqualified dividends,\u201d which would apply to the Walmart family holdings.)  The Waltons will have to pay only 20 percent tax on dividend income, compared with a 37 percent tax rate on annual income above $612,000 \u2014 so their taxes are almost cut in half. The workers will pay the 6.2 percent Social Security tax on all of their income, while the Waltons will stop paying any Social Security tax once their income exceeds $132,900. (There is no income limit on the 1.45 percent Medicare tax.) In other words, dividend income is much more valuable on an after-tax basis than ordinary income. A Walmart spokesman declined to comment. Even assuming a 40-hour week, the average Walmart worker earns less in a year than the Walton family earns in a minute just from dividends paid on the family\u2019s stock holdings. It\u2019s an astonishing statistic, and it happens to be correct. Sanders thus earns the coveted Geppetto Checkmark.

But a handful of congressional Democrats are seeking to highlight an issue\u00a0he\u00a0will almost surely fail to mention: climate change. They will do so by bringing\u00a0academics and activists who focus on climate change to be their guests\u00a0for the State of the Union speech\u00a0Tuesday night.\u00a0 The climate-themed invitees run the gamut, from longtime climate activist\u00a0Bill\u00a0McKibben, who was invited by Rep.\u00a0Jamie Raskin (Md.), to relative newcomers such as\u00a0Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, who got a seat from Sen. Edward J. Markey (Mass.). Prakash's group got Washington talking about a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d proposal to address greenhouse gas emissions by protesting late last year in then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's (Calif.) office. \u201cInstead of tackling the problem head-on, President Trump is burying his head in the sand and handing out favors to his friends in the coal industry,\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), who invited as her guest University of Washington professor Lisa Graumlich, a pioneer in using tree rings to understand climate trends.\u00a0\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s unlikely that President Trump will mention climate change or the dire need to protect our environment in his State of the Union at all.\u201d While Trump will almost certainly agitate about getting money to construct a sea-to-sea border wall, Democrats are letting Trump and Republicans\u00a0know that climate change will be a priority in Congress.\u00a0 And the day after Trump's address,\u00a0Democrats will hold the first House\u00a0hearing\u00a0on climate change in more than six years.\u00a0Meanwhile, the offices of Markey and Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) are preparing\u00a0a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d bill, giving legislative flesh to what had largely just been a slogan in the hopes that Democrats one day control enough of Washington to pass it. While any legislation House Democrats advance has little chance of being signed by Trump or even passing the GOP-controlled Senate, the renewed emphasis on climate change on Capitol Hill could elevate the issue in the 2020 election. Among the other\u00a0invitees is the head of an organization that more than any other environmental group worked to install a Democratic majority in the House. Rep. Paul Tonko of New York, the new chair of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on climate change and other environmental issues, invited\u00a0League of Conservation Voters Executive Director Gene Karpinski to the speech. His\u00a0group spent more than $80\u00a0million in the 2018 cycle\u00a0in support of a slate of\u00a0mostly Democratic candidates for federal, state and local office. \u201cI love to say, 'Elections have consequences,' \"\u00a0Karpinski said,\u00a0\u201cand I am thrilled that champions like Tonko are leading the new pro-environment House majority.\u201d Rep.\u00a0Chellie Pingree of Maine is bringing Joel Clement, one of the first whistleblowers in the Trump administration. Early in Trump's presidency, the career Interior Department executive said he was\u00a0retaliated against\u00a0for raising with senior department and White House officials the issue of the impact that climate change will have\u00a0on\u00a0Alaska Native communities. Clement ultimately resigned in October 2017.\u00a0 \u201cSince the Administration wants to stifle expert voices like Joel\u2019s \u2014 something it does at the country\u2019s peril \u2014 we stand ready to give them a pulpit,\u201d\u00a0Pingree said in a statement. Climate change isn't the only issue Democratic members of Congress will try to highlight in their State of the Union invitations this year. One New Jersey Democrat,\u00a0Bonnie Watson Coleman, invited an\u00a0undocumented Guatemalan woman who recently made headlines for\u00a0working at\u00a0Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., while Sen. Kamala Harris's (Calif.) plus-one is an air traffic controller who was furloughed during the partial government shutdown \u2014 Trump to nominate acting interior secretary to permanent role: The president announced on Twitter he plans to nominate David Bernhardt as the next interior secretary. Bernhardt has led the department as acting secretary since Jan. 2, following the departure of Ryan Zinke, who resigned amid multiple ethical investigations. Trump tweeted on Monday that\u00a0the 49-year-old Colorado native has \u201cdone a fantastic job.\u201d Some things to know about Bernhardt, who The Post\u2019s Juliet Eilperin, Josh Dawsey and Darryl Fears write is the \u201cultimate insider.\u201d  How Bernhardt finally got the nod: Up until a week ago, the president was leaning toward nominating former Rep. Cynthia M. Lummis (R-Wyo.) for the gig. But Bernhardt, at first\u00a0reluctant to take the role, had the opportunity to spend\u00a0more time with Trump as the president weighed the vacant post, and he \"made it clear he was prepared to leave the administration if the president tapped someone else for the top job.\"\u00a0 \u2014 Ex-Koch official now running chemical research at EPA: A former Koch Industries official now working at the EPA has reportedly been placed at the helm of research into how the Trump administration will regulate the class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, Politico reports. David Dunlap, a deputy in EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Developmen,\u00a0\u00a0\u201cbegan working on the issue almost immediately upon arriving at EPA in October,\u201d per the report. \u201cHe had spent the previous eight years as Koch Industries' lead expert on water and chemical regulations, a position that typically includes helping companies to limit regulatory restrictions and liability for cleanups.\u201d The regulation of these toxic chemicals could have financial implications for Dunlap\u2019s former employer. \u2014 What the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d may leave out: The \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d legislation Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Markey are expected to unveil soon will reportedly omit an explicit call to end oil, gas and coal development in the United States, Politico reports. While the bill will seek to \u201cachieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for a fair and just transition for frontline communities and displaced workers,\u201d it doesn\u2019t call for eliminating fossil fuels, per the report, which notes the \u201cchange is a compromise that may make the proposal more politically palatable for many of the Democrats' presidential contenders in 2020, as well as for labor groups that compose a powerful portion of the party's base. But it will disappoint many of the progressives who have rallied and staged sit-ins in the Capitol in recent months to demand swift action on climate change.\u201d \u2014 Signs of\u00a0border wall construction at the National Butterfly Center: \"Heavy equipment has arrived at the National Butterfly Center, signaling the start of a border wall that will slice through the protected habitat,\" the San Antonio Express-News reports.

(Erik Carlson\/ATX Video Marketing) AUSTIN \u2014 The European Union\u2019s top competition cop says her preliminary investigation into Amazon\u2019s data practices is in \u201cquite advanced\u201d stages. Margrethe Vestager \u2014 who has emerged as the world\u2019s toughest Big Tech regulator \u2014 is racing against the clock to determine whether to bring a formal antitrust case against the e-commerce giant before her term as commissioner ends in October. Her team is probing whether Amazon uses the data it collects from businesses that sell products on its platform to inform its own product sales and undercut its competitors.\u00a0\u00a0(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P.\u00a0Bezos owns The Washington Post.) \u201cSince it\u2019s not given that I can continue for the commissioner for competition, I would like to take more decisive steps before I have to go,\u201d Vestager told a small group of reporters at South by Southwest. \u201cWe\u2019re pushing it for obvious reasons.\u201d\u00a0 As Europe seeks to crack down on Big Tech, Vestager is especially focused on the competition issues that arise\u00a0when companies are both\u00a0marketplaces that host other sellers -- and retailers competing to peddle their own products. Vestager wants to make sure the biggest players that drive the digital economy -- a la Amazon -- are not abusing their market dominance and hurting consumers as they use data from competitors\u00a0to inform their own business decisions.\u00a0 A\u00a0formal case against Amazon\u00a0could set the tone for how policymakers across the world -- even in the U.S. -- might treat the issue.\u00a0 It extends\u00a0far beyond one\u00a0e-commerce giant, Vestager told me.\u00a0\u201cAmazon is not the only one,\u201d Vestager said.\u00a0\u201cGoogle also has this nature because they also are being the navigation tool to find a lot of businesses, businesses that they themselves compete with.\u201d\u00a0 Vestager said Google Shopping is another example of her worries. In 2017, she fined Google for steering customers to its own service that lets people compare products from around the Web over competing online shopping services. That\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0fine and others\u00a0have built Vestager's reputation as Silicon Valley's top nemesis across the pond.\u00a0And\u00a0at a time when many American politicians are just\u00a0talking about antitrust and reining in Big Tech, Vestager has built a record on taking action. She\u00a0also fined the search engine a record-setting $5 billion for forcing Android phone manufacturers to pre-install the Google search app and Chrome Web app on the phones. She's also fined Amazon and Apple for failing to pay taxes. As 2020 Democratic presidential candidates steered the conversation at South by Southwest toward how they would regulate the technology industry, there was perhaps no more approporiate year for Vestager to attend the festival.\u00a0\u00a0 But her approach differs from that of\u00a0presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who gave an impassioned pitch at the festival for her plan to break up Big Tech.\u00a0 When I asked her about Warren's plan, Vestager said Europe could also try to break up the companies through legislation.\u00a0\u201cIt would for us be an issue of the very, very, very last resort,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Warren (D-Mass.) and Vestager\u00a0are concerned about the same competition issue, though.\u00a0In our interview, Warren said she wanted to break up Amazon so it could not unfairly use the data it collects from sellers to compete with them.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s like in baseball. You can be the umpire; that\u2019s like the platform,\u201d Warren said. \u201cOr you can own the team; that\u2019s one of the businesses. But you don\u2019t get to be the umpire and own the team in the league.\u201d As Vestager looks long-term at the work she wants to do to ensure European\u00a0authorities are prepared to address competition\u00a0issues involving technology, she tells me she's closely watching the hearings the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is holding on how the agency should address digital challenges.\u00a0 \"I really like this approach, that they get a stock taking,\" she said. \"We're interested as colleagues and colleagues from my services will come over and have a listening ear.\" BITS: Warren says Facebook's decision to remove (and later restore) her ads calling for the breakup of tech giants underscores her point: that the social network has too much power.\u00a0 Facebook removed several of Warren's posts yesterday that called for the unwinding of several large technology mergers, including Facebook's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. After Politico spotted the ads' removal, the company later restored them.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe removed the ads because they violated our policies against use of our corporate logo,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIn the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring the ads.\u201d NIBBLES: The Department of Homeland Security is rushing to deploy facial recognition systems across the country to comply with an executive order, but it's doing so without proper vetting and\u00a0using methods some privacy advocates say are against the law, according to BuzzFeed News's Davey Alba.\u00a0 \u201cU.S. Customs and Border Protection is scrambling to implement this \u201cbiometric entry-exit system,\u201d with the goal of using facial recognition technology on travelers aboard 16,300 flights per week \u2014 or more than 100 million passengers traveling on international flights out of the United States \u2014 in as little as two years, to meet Trump's accelerated timeline for a biometric system that had initially been signed into law by the Obama administration,\u201d according to 346 pages of documents shared with BuzzFeed.\u00a0 Officials are rushing to implement the system with few legal guardrails, at a time when there are serious questions about the accuracy of facial recognition technology \u2014 especially among certain racial minorities.\u00a0 Rep.

(Seminar Network) With Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \u2014 The donor network led by billionaire industrialist Charles Koch will launch a new organization next month to focus on changing K-12 education as we know it. The effort will begin as a pilot project focused on five states with a combined school-age population of 16 million kids, but officials said Monday that they aren\u2019t ready to identify them yet because they\u2019re still finalizing partnerships with some of the country\u2019s leading educational organizations. The still-unnamed entity purportedly plans to focus on three buckets: changing public policy to address \u201cthe root causes\u201d of failing schools, developing new technologies to promote individualized learning, and investing in teachers and classrooms. The announcement came Monday at the end of a three-day seminar where 634 donors who have each committed to contribute at least $100,000 annually to Koch-linked groups gathered under palm trees at a luxury resort in the Coachella Valley. The Koch team is modeling its amped-up education efforts on its successful overhaul of the criminal justice system, which began in friendly states before moving to the federal level. In that case, Koch World sought out unlikely allies and played the long game for years before any big legislation passed. In the past, most conversations about education at these twice-annual Koch confabs have quickly turned into bashing teachers unions. So it was notable when Brian Hooks, the chairman of the Koch network, went out of his way to praise teachers and acknowledge that many have been picketing recently. \u201cFor too long, this issue has been framed unnecessarily as us vs. them, public vs. private, teacher vs. student, parent vs. administrator,\u201d Hooks told a ballroom of donors. \u201cThe teachers who have expressed frustration in the past several months are good people. I mean, they\u2019re teachers. We all remember the positive impact that a teacher or several teachers have had on our lives. They\u2019re expressing legitimate concerns. But the current approach means that nobody wins, so they need better options.\u201d Hooks recognizes that many will question their motives, but he said the goal is to \u201creally shake things up\u201d by \u201ccoming alongside concerned teachers\u201d to \u201cfind a better way.\u201d Teachers union leaders, who are closely aligned with the Democratic Party, have accused the Koch groups of trying to undermine traditional public schools. Koch and his allies say the system is broken and requires wholesale changes. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has been a longtime ally of the network. \u201cThis is a tough one, no doubt,\u201d Hooks said. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge that a whole lot of people look at and say is impossible. But we see a tremendous opportunity to unite people to help ensure that every kid has the opportunity to succeed.\u201d Philanthropist Stacy Hock of Austin, a major Koch donor who has been funding education efforts at the state level in Texas for years, says that traditional forms of classroom instruction encourage \u201csoul-crushing\u201d conformity, and she has emerged as an outspoken advocate of \u201cpersonalized learning.\u201d \u201cFamilies are getting more and more comfortable with experimenting and taking risks,\u201d she said on the sidelines of the meeting. \u201cEducation should be getting way, way better and way, way cheaper, but the opposite is happening.\u201d Hock said the new Koch initiative, as it ramps up, will identify what\u2019s working at the local level and push for those things to be replicated elsewhere. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing all across the country are little flames,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t yet know is how to throw gasoline on all those flames.\u201d Thousands of teachers march in the rain through Los Angeles earlier this month while striking for smaller class sizes, better school funding formulas and higher teacher pay. (Frederic J. Brown\/AFP\/Getty Images) -- The network\u2019s pivot toward education is partly because a personal interest in the subject by Chase Koch, Charles\u2019s 41-year-old son. He is an executive in the family business who has been taking on a more prominent role inside the network his dad began convening in 2003. Chase\u2019s wife, Annie, a neonatal nurse by training, opened a private school in September called Wonder on the campus of Wichita State University. It\u2019s initially for elementary-age children, and the plan is to phase in middle and high school programs. There\u2019s lots of experimentation going on, with the goal of letting children pursue what interests them the most and not follow a strict curriculum. -- Previewing their K-12 push, Koch strategists pointed to research being conducted with their financial support by Ashley Berner at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Institute for Education Policy. Her main interest is expanding what she calls \u201ceducational pluralism,\u201d which is when the government funds all types of schools, including explicitly religious ones, but does not necessarily run them. \u201cBerner points to examples such as the Netherlands, which funds 36 different types of schools, from Islamic to Jewish Orthodox to socialist,\u201d the Charles Koch Foundation notes in a summary of her work. \u201cAlberta, Canada, funds homeschooling along with Inuit, Jewish, and secular schools. In Australia, the central government is the nation\u2019s top funder of independent schools. Other countries with plural school systems include Denmark, Finland, Germany, and Sweden.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the democratic norm around the world. In pluralism, choice and accountability are two sides of the same coin,\u201d said Berner, who wrote a book in 2017 called \u201cPluralism and American Public Education: No One Way to School.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start supporting politicians who are willing to make compromises. Americans are tired of the battles between charters and district schools; these take up too much energy and resources. A pluralistic system doesn\u2019t pit entire sectors against one another.\u201d -- Koch will continue to make heavy investments in higher education as well. The Charles Koch Foundation already provides financial support to more than 350 colleges and universities, which has generated controversy and pushback on many campuses. John Hardin, the director of university relations for the Koch Foundation, said the network\u2019s investments in education \u201claid the intellectual foundation\u201d to achieve the public policy changes the donors wanted on criminal justice. For example, the donors helped finance an Academy for Justice conference that convened 120 scholars on criminal justice to talk about their research. \u201cThis is how you get it done and change the paradigm,\u201d Hardin told donors during a presentation. \u201cThe Academy for Justice is changing the debate.\u201d\u00a0 A booklet provided to donors, which outlined some of the network\u2019s major investments, highlighted support for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, which produces research that is routinely cited by allies in government. \u201cMercatus scholars are re-shaping the field of regulatory economics and changing the debate over rightsizing the administrative state,\u201d the handbook noted. -- The Koch network is also setting its sights on publishers of pricey textbooks. The foundation, which is part of the network, is supporting OpenStax at Rice University, which produces books that are available for free online to students. Charles Koch put up the money for a series of textbooks about business, including ethics, entrepreneurship, principles of management and organizational behavior. David Harris, the editor in chief of the project, said in an interview that Koch gave his team full editorial independence, that the books are all peer-reviewed and that OpenStax receives financial support from liberal foundations, too, including the one funded by George Soros. About 30 free open-source texts are now available, and more are in the pipeline. -- The goal of all this investment is to change \u201cthe trajectory of the country.\u201d Kevin Gentry, a top Koch lieutenant who works for Koch Industries, told donors yesterday that they can have perhaps the greatest impact by focusing on civil society initiatives like these. \u201cThose of you have been coming to these meetings for a long time know we\u2019ve gone through a lot of ups and downs,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of times we would say, \u2018Okay, this was good, but were we really \u2026 changing the trajectory of the country?\u2019 \u2026 We feel like a couple of years ago we began to turn the corner, but now is the opportunity to scale.\u201d -- One reason the wealthy donors are so amenable to investing so much in education is alarm about the next generation. Recent polling shows younger people have a more favorable impression of socialism than capitalism. \u201cThe younger generation is less sympathetic and less understanding of limited government conservatism,\u201d said Art Pope of North Carolina, a fixture of Koch meetings. \u201cThey\u2019re more sympathetic or more willing to give not just social justice but outright socialism a chance. \u2026 It used to be you didn\u2019t have to have a serious conversation about socialism in American politics. Now you do. So what is the appeal of that? How do you message?\u201d -- Many progressives are dubious and skeptical of the Koch rebranding effort, which I wrote about in yesterday\u2019s Daily 202. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) wrote in: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced by the Koch network\u2019s new charm offensive; nor should your readers be. Until we know how much the Kochs, and the 634 other mega-donors who joined them, are spending on dark-money campaigns to block action on climate change, undermine public unions, confirm obedient judges, and cut their own taxes by billions of dollars, we should view their latest PR effort as more obfuscation. \u2026 If Charles Koch\u2019s top goal is \u2018uniting with people across the whole spectrum,\u2019 he should unite them around honest facts and science, not deceitful campaigns funded by dark money.\u201d -- While they may still share many of the same goals, especially when it comes to judges and regulations, there is mounting tension between the Koch network and the official GOP apparatus. My colleague Michelle Ye Hee Lee, who covers money in politics and has also been here for the donor meeting, scoops that the data firm aligned with the Republican National Committee does not plan to renew a data-sharing agreement with the Koch network for the 2020 cycle, after years of working in tandem to enrich voter files for GOP campaigns and state parties. Henry Barbour, the chairman of the RNC-backed firm Data Trust, said the split was prompted by the network\u2019s decision not to endorse President Trump for reelection in 2020 or to support Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) last fall. \u201cIn the past, [the Koch network\u2019s data operation] i360 was a consistent supporter of the Republican and conservative ecosystem, so we have worked with them to help win elections, but that has changed,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a path where we have an agreement with them in the 2020 election cycle.\u201d Casino mogul Steve Wynn speaks at a 2016 news conference in Medford, Mass.

(New York Times) THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- The Justice Department charged the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei with fraud. Ellen Nakashima and Devlin Barrett report: \u201cA 13-count indictment filed in New York City against Huawei, two affiliates and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, details allegations of bank and wire fraud. The company also is charged with violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and conspiring to obstruct justice related to the investigation. Canadian officials arrested Meng on a U.S. warrant Dec. 1. She has since been released on bail, and her travel is confined to Vancouver and surrounding areas. Meng could face up to 30 years if found guilty on all counts. On Monday evening, the Canadian Justice Department confirmed it had received a formal request for Meng\u2019s extradition from the United States to stand trial. ... Beijing has pressured Canada to release Meng. \u2026 \u201cThe indictment threatened to further strain relations between Washington and Beijing as officials from both countries prepare for talks this week aimed at ending a months-long economic impasse that has contributed to huge swings in the stock market. Although [Trump] had suggested he was willing to help secure Meng\u2019s release if China met his demands for a trade deal, Justice and Commerce department officials insisted Meng\u2019s criminal case was a separate matter.\u201d -- The Trump administration announced sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s oil industry in an effort to force President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro out of power. Karen DeYoung, Steven Mufson and Anthony Faiola report: \u201cAny attempt to harm remaining U.S. diplomats in Venezuela, or violence against the newly recognized president, Juan Guaid\u00f3, \u2018will be met with a significant response,\u2019 White House national security adviser John Bolton said. He declined to define that response ... [Trump] \u2018has made it very clear \u2026\u00a0all options are on the table,\u2019 said Bolton, who announced the sanctions at a White House press briefing alongside Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. ... \u201cPentagon officials have indicated they have no orders to prepare for military action toward Venezuela. But by starving Maduro of a critical source of cash, the Trump administration has dramatically increased the pressure on his government. Maduro, responding in televised remarks to diplomats gathered in Caracas, said: \u2018Never before was there an open coup attempt led from Washington. Today John Bolton asked for a coup, a desperate blow. ... There\u2019s no limit to the extremist group that took over the White House. They\u2019re like the Ku Klux Klan.\u2019\u201d -- Writing\u00a0on Bolton\u2019s notepad\u00a0reading \u201c5,000 troops to Colombia\u201d during the briefing raised more questions about possible military intervention in Venezuela. From Eli Rosenberg and Dan Lamothe: Pentagon officials\u00a0\u201csaid that the Defense Department hadn\u2019t received any orders to this effect. Asked about the briefing pad, the White House pointed to statements made by [Trump] and Bolton in recent days that \u2018all options are on the table\u2019 regarding Venezuela. \u2026 If enacted, the troop movement would mark a major escalation of U.S. involvement in South America, though it is unclear what exactly the service members\u2019 roles would be.\u201d -- Advancing peace negotiations between U.S. and Taliban officials has\u00a0the potential to soon bring an end to America\u2019s longest war. Pamela Constable, Missy Ryan and Paul Sonne report: \u201cAfghan President Ashraf Ghani, speaking from his palace in Kabul, addressed what appeared to be a significant breakthrough in talks between American officials and Taliban representatives in Doha, Qatar, calling on insurgents to begin \u2018serious talks\u2019 with his government and embrace a \u2018speedy peace.\u2019 \u2026 But both U.S. and Afghan officials said several major issues remain to be resolved before a peace agreement can be reached, including U.S. demands for an extended cease-fire and the Afghan government\u2019s insistence on being included in talks about the Taliban\u2019s future role in government and society.\u201d THERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Acting attorney general Matt Whitaker said special counsel Bob Mueller\u2019s investigation is \u201cclose to being completed.\u201d Devlin Barrett reports: \u201cWhitaker made the comment during a news conference to announce indictments against [Huawei]. Asked about his view of the Mueller probe in light of critical comments he made while working as a television pundit in 2017, Whitaker said those statements were offered while he was a private citizen. \u2018I have been fully briefed on the investigation and I look forward to Director Mueller delivering the final report,\u2019 Whitaker said. \u2018I am comfortable that the decisions that were made are going to be reviewed. \u2026\u00a0Right now, you know, the investigation is, I think, close to being completed.\u2019 Whitaker\u2019s remarks, though brief, represent the most extensive comments on the subject by any senior law enforcement official in recent months. \u2026 Law enforcement officials, however, have said Mueller envisions eventually handing off prosecutorial work from his investigation to U.S. attorneys.\u201d -- But, but, but: An attorney for a former employee of Roger Stone said Mueller still wants his client\u2019s testimony, indicating the special counsel may be planning another indictment of Stone or others. CNN\u2019s Sara Murray and Katelyn Polantz report: Defense attorney Paul\u00a0Kamenar's client is Andrew\u00a0Miller, \u201ca former employee of Stone's whom Mueller subpoenaed in mid-2018 to testify to the grand jury. In a court hearing about Miller's testimony, a judge made clear that Mueller sought information Miller had about Stone's communications regarding Wikileaks\u00a0and Russian hackers around the time they disseminated damaging hacked Democratic emails. \u2026 Justice Department guidelines say that a grand jury can only hear evidence after a person is indicted only if the grand jury continues to work on new charges \u2014 either against that person or against additional planned defendants. In short, when a defendant like Stone is indicted, prosecutors must already have the evidence needed to take the case they open to trial. So Miller's testimony may relate to a still-unknown criminal case.\u201d -- Stone\u2019s former associate Jerome Corsi claimed Stone expressed hope the WikiLeaks email dumps during the 2016 campaign would coincide with news of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. Isaac Stanley-Becker reports: \u201c\u2018I had one call from Roger, as I recall it \u2014 Roger disputes this \u2014 on the day that WikiLeaks did begin in October dropping the final emails on John Podesta, in which Roger was essentially saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this timing issue because the Billy Bush tape is going to be released, and we\u2019d like to have Assange begin releasing emails now,\u2019\u2019 Corsi told MSNBC\u2019s Ari Melber on Monday evening. \u2026 Corsi acknowledged that he could not \u2018prove\u2019 that the longtime Republican operative and self-described \u2018dirty trickster\u2019 had taken steps to influence the timing of the email dump. Instead, he merely shared his recollection of their phone conversation.\u201d -- William Barr once again refused to guarantee that he would publicly release Mueller\u2019s report if confirmed as attorney general. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cBarr stressed that his \u2018goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law\u2019 in several of the answers he provided to [Judiciary Committee] senators, who challenged him to offer better assurances that he would release the report than he did during a confirmation hearing earlier this month. Democrats on the panel also failed to secure a firmer promise from Barr to alert them if Justice Department ethics officials advise him to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe, reserving the final decision for himself. \u2026 On Monday, Sens. Richard J. Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, introduced a bill to guarantee that every special-counsel report would be released directly to Congress and the public, effectively taking out the attorney general as middleman.\u201d -- Barr added in his written answers to the Senate that he has discussed the Mueller probe with Vice President Pence. The AP\u2019s Eric Tucker reports: Barr said\u00a0\u201cthat he and Pence have had occasional conversations since the spring of 2017 on matters including policy and personnel. Some of those conversations included \u2018general discussion of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation in which I gave my views on such matters as Bob Mueller\u2019s high integrity and various media reports.\u2019 \u2018In these conversations, I did not provide legal advice, nor, to the best of my recollection, did he provide confidential information,\u2019 Barr told Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat.\u201d -- Trump\u2019s former attorney\u00a0Michael Cohen has agreed to testify behind closed doors before the House Intelligence Committee as he shakes up his legal team. Matt Zapotosky reports: \u201cLanny J. Davis, one of Cohen\u2019s lawyers who also has served as his media representative, said in a statement that Cohen is bringing on Michael Monico and Barry Spevack \u2014 two veteran Chicago-based lawyers from the firm Monico and Spevack \u2014 to replace Guy Petrillo and Amy Lester, who had represented him as he went through proceedings in federal court in Manhattan. A person familiar with the matter said Cohen had fallen behind in his bills to Petrillo and Lester, although Davis disputed that this led to the change. \u2026 On Monday, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Cohen had agreed to appear voluntarily before the House Intelligence Committee on Feb. 8 for nonpublic testimony. He already had been issued a subpoena to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee, also a closed-door session, and is expected to do so Feb. 12, Davis has said.\u201d -- A federal judge delayed former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u2019s sentencing on tax and bank fraud convictions, citing his ongoing dispute with Mueller\u2019s team. From Rachel Weiner: \u201cManafort\u2019s sentencing hearing in federal court in Alexandria had been set for Feb. 8. A new date has not been scheduled. The postponement was sparked by allegations made by prosecutors in Manafort\u2019s related case in D.C. federal court, where the former Trump campaign chairman pleaded guilty to crimes related to his undisclosed lobbying work. The special counsel said Manafort lied repeatedly to the FBI and a grand jury after committing to offer truthful information. Manafort, 69, has maintained that he made honest mistakes and did his best to correct them.\u201d SHUTDOWN FALLOUT: -- Trump accepted an invitation from Nancy Pelosi to reschedule his State of the Union address for Feb. 5. Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201c\u2018We have a great story to tell and yet, great goals to achieve!\u2019 he said in the letter, which was released by the White House.\u201d -- While federal employees tried to get the government back up to speed, the possibility of another shutdown in three weeks hangs over every office. Lisa Rein, Tracy Jan and Kimberly Kindy report: \u201cIn airports, security lines were moving faster after five weeks of extended absences sidelined 10 percent of the nation\u2019s baggage screeners. National Park Service rangers assessed the damage from winter weather. The Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo prepared to reopen Tuesday. The shutdown cost the American economy about $3 billion, the Congressional Budget Office estimated Monday. As they returned to work, employees were concerned that they might not receive back pay for several weeks.\u201d -- \u201cIt was a routine day, except not,\u201d Dan Zak, Caitlin Gibson and Ben Terris report of government workers\u2019 first day back at the office. \u201cLaurel Bryant works at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, up in Silver Spring. The mood Monday was joyous, like a big family reunion \u2014 if your family had to suddenly drop everything and scatter for five weeks. Everyone\u2019s equipment had to be left behind, and passwords were forgotten, but the wizards from IT were circulating, checking in with everyone, asking if all was okay. Too many people were logging on at the same time to fill out their timecards, so the system kept crashing. \u2018I came back to 4,459 emails,\u2019 Bryant said. \u2018I\u2019m down to 4,222.\u2019 It was barely past 11 a.m. \u2018I\u2019ll get through it.\u2019\u201d THE IMMIGRATION WARS RAGE ON: -- Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) said Trump hopes to reach a \u201csimple\u201d\u00a0deal on the border wall rather than a broader immigration agreement before government funding once again lapses on Feb. 15. Seung Min Kim reports: Perdue,\u00a0\u201cwho lunched privately with the president Sunday at the White House, also indicated that Trump is prepared to act on his own should a new committee on Capitol Hill struggle to come up with an agreement on the wall that satisfies him. \u2026 \u2018He wants as simple of a solution as we can get,\u2019 Perdue said in an interview Monday. While the president would like a more sweeping immigration package at some point, Perdue said Trump acknowledges \u2018that\u2019s just not realistic in three weeks.\u2019 Perdue added that while Trump is \u2018hopeful\u2019 that a new bipartisan committee of 17 lawmakers can strike a deal on modest border security, \u2018at the end of the day, if in three weeks [there is no resolution], this president\u2019s ready to move.\u2019\u201d -- Trump's 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale is encouraging the president to stand by his demand for a border wall even if it means another shutdown. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash and Bridget Nolan report: \u201cAs part of his pitch, Parscale is presenting the President with internal data that shows voters in key swing areas believe a border wall or fence is needed. After the shutdown ended, Parscale commissioned a GOP firm to test the President's job performance and his border policies in 10 swing House districts where Democrats won in November. The chosen districts allow Parscale to show how staying the course could put pressure on House Democrats and [Pelosi] to break their so far steadfast opposition to funding a border wall.\u201d -- But Senate Republicans are voicing little desire for a second shutdown, per Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett, John Bresnahan and Sarah Ferris. \u201cThough House Republicans aren\u2019t ruling out supporting the president should he choose another confrontation over his border wall, the Republican Senate majority \u2014 which actually has governing power \u2014 has another view. \u2018I did not love the shutdown. I wouldn\u2019t think anybody would have another shutdown,\u2019 said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), one of the key negotiators trying to strike a deal on border security.\u201d -- Barr refused to answer whether he would defend Trump in court if he unilaterally declares\u00a0a national emergency as a pretext to fund the wall. From Politico\u2019s Marianne Levine: \u201c\u2018I have not examined the facts and circumstances pertaining to security on the southern border with this issue in mind, and therefore, I am not in a position to further comment on what would constitute a national emergency,\u2019 Barr wrote in response to a question from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) He added that if he is confirmed, he\u2019d ensure \u2018that the Department\u2019s advice on this subject is consistent with any applicable law.\u2019\u201d -- Senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller said, \u201cI would be happy if not a single refugee foot ever again touched American soil,\u201d according to former White House communications aide Cliff Sims\u2019s new book \u201cTeam of Vipers,\u201d which hits stores today. The Associated Press reports: \u201cSims writes that, any time a refugee or immigrant committed a \u2018gruesome\u2019 crime, Miller would walk over to the White House press office to demand that press releases be issued about the cases. Sims says Miller made the comment about refugees during a conversation the two were having about immigration. \u2026 Miller did not respond to an emailed request for comment. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said during a rare televised briefing Monday, \u2018I\u2019m not aware of any statement like that that Stephen Miller has ever made.\u2019\u201d Note: That is not a denial. -- Meanwhile, the Trump Winery in Virginia has again submitted a request to hire foreign guest workers. BuzzFeed News\u2019s Jeremy Singer-Vine, Ken Bensinger and Jessica Garrison report: \u201cTrump Winery, also known as Trump Vineyard Estates, LLC, is seeking the workers under the federal H-2 visa program, which allows US employers to hire foreign laborers on a temporary basis as long as no qualified US workers want the jobs. \u2026 Businesses owned by or bearing the name of Trump \u2026 have sought to hire more than 600 foreign guest workers since he launched his presidential campaign in June 2015. Many have worked as servers and house cleaners at Mar-a-Lago as well as at the president\u2019s various golf clubs.\u201d -- A comedian based in Portland, Ore., and originally from Libya\u00a0said Border Patrol agents forced him off a Greyhound bus in Washington state and accused him of presenting false identification when they asked him for proof of citizenship. \u201cI explained to them that I was granted asylum here in the United States, and that the work permit they currently hold and the license are impossible to get unless your presence here is legal,\u201d Mohanad Elshieky said in a Twitter thread that has gone viral. \u201cThey told me that I was lying and these could pretty much be falsified.\u201d (Luz Lazo) 2020 WATCH: -- A majority of Americans say they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d not vote for Trump if the election were held today as the Democratic primary race looks wide open, according to a fresh\u00a0Post-ABC poll. Michael Scherer and Scott Clement report: \u201cWhen asked whom they would support today for the Democratic presidential nomination, 56 percent of self-identified Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents did not offer a name. No candidate received double-digit support, with former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) leading the pack. The lack of commitment on the Democratic side comes as Trump appears vulnerable to defeat in a 2020 general election, and perhaps even to a challenge from within the Republican Party. A 56 percent majority of all Americans say they would \u2018definitely not vote for him\u2019 should Trump become the Republican nominee, while 14 percent say they would consider voting for him and 28 percent would definitely vote for him. Majorities of independents (59 percent), women (64 percent) and suburbanites (56 percent) rule out supporting Trump for a second term.\u201d -- Former Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz disputed the idea that his potential independent presidential campaign would guarantee Trump a second term. NPR\u2019s Jessica Taylor reports: \u201cSchultz pushed back on that concern, arguing that he could be successful where other independent candidates haven't been by appealing to an increasingly growing center and peeling off Democratic voters put off by the party's progressive leanings. \u2018I think lifelong Democrats and many, many more lifelong Republicans than Democrats realize are looking for a home,\u2019 Schultz said. \u2018If there is a choice between President Trump and a progressive liberal-minded person on the Democratic side, it would kill me to see President Trump be re-elected, and I believe that is what would take place.\u2019\u201d -- A heckler concerned about Schultz\u2019s presidential ambitions disrupted his book tour event in New York City. Before being escorted out by security, the heckler said, \u201cDon\u2019t help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire \u2026 Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter. Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.\u201d (ABC News) -- Schultz has hired two well-known political strategists from opposite parties to help him map out a run, according to CBS News\u2019s Ed O'Keefe and Camilo Montoya-Galvez. Steve Schmidt, \u201ca former top Republican strategist, helped run George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign and the failed 2008 presidential bid by GOP Arizona Senator John McCain. [Bill] Burton helped run Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and later served as deputy White House press secretary. In June 2018, Schmidt announced he was leaving the Republican Party, tweeting in June that it had become \u2018fully the party of Trump.\u2019 Schmidt has been long rumored as a potential Schultz aide, given that he has spoken out publicly about the potential openings for an independent candidate. Burton, who once considered running for Congress from Buffalo, is based in California and is leaving his role with the Democratic media strategy firm SKDKnickerbocker.\u201d -- Kamala Harris said she would support ending private insurance to enact Medicare-for-all.\u00a0CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby and Gregory Krieg report: \u201c\u2018We need to have Medicare-for-all,\u2019 Harris told a questioner in the audience [at her CNN town hall], noting it's something she feels \u2018very strongly\u2019 about. When pressed by CNN's Jake Tapper if that means eliminating private insurance, the senator answered affirmatively, saying she would be OK with cutting insurers out of the mix. She also accused them of thinking only of their bottom lines and of burdening Americans with paperwork and approval processes. \u2026 It was an answer that Republicans immediately jumped on. Michael Ahrens, rapid response director for the Republican National Committee, said on Twitter, \u2018Dems in 2019: If you like your plan, we're eliminating it.\u2019\u201d -- Harris could face hurdles trying to achieve the same level of support Barack Obama received from black voters during the 2008 Democratic primaries. The New York Times\u2019s Astead W. Herndon and Susan Chira report: \u201cIn many ways, she is well positioned: Ms. Harris is the most high-profile and politically connected black woman ever to run for president, and she can also draw on her powerful alumni networks from Howard University, one of the most prominent historically black colleges, and Alpha Kappa Alpha, the oldest black sorority. Yet interviews with more than 30 black voters and political leaders in early primary states like South Carolina and her home state, California, show that Ms. Harris faces challenges. She will have to persuade black activists skeptical of her record as a prosecutor; overcome sexism and a bias on the part of some voters that a female candidate cannot beat [Trump]; and work to gain broader support from black men, who generally expressed more wariness about Ms. Harris in interviews than black women.\u201d -- Joe Biden told a crowd in Florida he will \u201cmake the decision soon.\u201d From Politico\u2019s Marc Caputo: \u201cBiden made his remarks about his future plans during a question-and-answer portion of an event billed as \u2018An Evening with Vice President Joe Biden\u2019 at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts, which had so many people in attendance that Biden said even his daughter wondered about 2020. \u2018Dad, are we running?\u2019 Biden said she told him as they walked in. \u2018The answer,\u2019 Biden said to the crowd, \u2018is that I\u2019m running the traps on this. I don\u2019t want to make this a fool\u2019s errand. I\u2019m a lot closer than I was before Christmas and we\u2019ll make the decision soon.\u2019\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Trump attacked Sen.

Over lunch at New York\u2019s five-star Peninsula Hotel, the white-bearded visitor, who said his name was Michel Lambert, praised Mr. Scott-Railton\u2019s work and pried for details about Citizen Lab. Then \u2014 \u2018as I was finishing my cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e,\u2019 Mr. Scott-Railton said \u2014 a reporter and photographer from The Associated Press, alerted by Mr. Scott-Railton and lurking nearby, confronted the visitor, who bumped into chairs and circled the room while trying to flee. \u2026 The case of the bumbling spy is the latest episode involving undercover agents, working for private intelligence firms or other clients, who adopt false identities to dig up compromising information about or elicit embarrassing statements from their targets.\u201d -- \u201cLifestyle guru B. Smith has Alzheimer\u2019s. Her husband has a girlfriend. Her fans aren\u2019t having it,\u201d by Lavanya Ramanathan: \u201cShe is still model-slim at 69, actually. Her face, now framed with a halo of tight gray curls, is just as it was 20 years ago, when B. Smith was on TV, on the cover of magazines and books, when she had restaurants, when everyone seemed to call her \u2018the black Martha Stewart,\u2019 as if it weren\u2019t enough to just be B. Smith. Six years ago, she was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u2026 Not long after, B.\u2019s restaurants shuttered. Her appearances dried up. With Dan Gasby, her husband and business partner of more than two decades, she turned her efforts to speaking about Alzheimer\u2019s and advocating for research. Then, she didn\u2019t do much talking at all. \u2026 Dan had never been the type to bite his tongue, never bothered with niceties. At 64, he had a wife, and he had a girlfriend named Alex Lerner. He was happy and in love.

It included a somber image of a candle and a star-shaped yellow badge, the symbol the Nazis forced Jewish people to wear during the Holocaust to identify and psychologically isolate them. The GOP chapter then added its own note: \u2018Leftism kills,\u2019 the caption began. \u2018In memory of the 6 million Jews lost to Nazi hatred in the name of National Socialism. We will never forget.\u2019 Many decried the post as offensive and accused the group of politicizing one of history\u2019s greatest atrocities.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT: \u201c'No Reason For It Except to Intimidate': Chris Christie Rips Mueller for Ordering Stone Raid,\u201d from Fox News: \u201cFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Monday on \u2018Hannity\u2019 that though he has defended [Mueller] in the past, the raid on Roger Stone's home was indefensible. Christie said that, if the Mueller team knew Stone owned no weapons and had not posed a threat, then there was \u2018no reason\u2019 for the show of force Mueller ordered the FBI to display in Fort Lauderdale on Friday. \u2018There's no reason except to intimidate [Stone],\u2019 Christie, a Republican from Mendham, said.

(Jabin Botsford\/The Washington Post)\u00a0 President Trump\u2019s plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is held up in a political stalemate with congressional Democrats. But one of Trump\u2019s most prominent supporters in the tech industry tells me virtual border security is already here \u2014 and rapidly expanding. Palmer Luckey's company, Anduril Industries, is deploying a security system along the border designed to detect illegal\u00a0crossings, using towers equipped with radar sensors and cameras, as well as artificial intelligence to spot abnormalities human eyes might miss. His company is expanding its systems\u00a0in California this month under a contract with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\u00a0 The focus here in Washington is on Trump's call for a physical wall \u2014 especially as the president considers declaring a national emergency to build it. After the longest government shutdown in U.S. history did not yield a breakthrough in border security negotiations, Democrats who are resistant to building a physical wall have said they are open to funding for a \u201csmart wall,\u201d or some other\u00a0alternative to secure the\u00a0border using technology.\u00a0 As Trump is expected to amp up his calls for a wall in tonight's State of the Union address, Luckey says technology such as\u00a0Anduril's system, known as Lattice, could be something that ultimately garners bipartisan support. He wants lawmakers to know that this kind of technology is not a \u201cpie- in-the-sky\u201d fantasy. \u201cWe\u2019re not a concept, we\u2019re not a white paper, we\u2019re a real system that\u2019s actually deployed in multiple sites on the U.S. border,\u201d Luckey tells me. \u201cWe just signed a large expansion of our technology on the border, and we\u2019re going to be putting more of it out there.\u201d Luckey is loudly touting his border wall technology \u2014 in stark contrast from many technology titans who have grappled with internal pushback for their work with the Trump administration on immigration. Last year, employees protested Salesforce's software contracts with CBP\u00a0and Amazon employees called on the company to cut ties with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, especially after reports that the e-commerce giant was selling facial recognition technology to government agencies.\u00a0(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) After facing backlash for his own political beliefs in Silicon Valley, Luckey says he is trying to position Anduril as a company where employees across the political spectrum can be open and proud about doing work\u00a0for the government.\u00a0\u201cThis is not a place where you come to fight about politics, this is a place you come to work on important national security technology,\u201d Luckey said. \u201cThe people who are scared of an environment like that and only want to work in an environment that caters to their particular ideology are probably not the people who would fit in\u00a0very well.\u201d Luckey said the need to recruit employees willing to do government work contributed to his decision to headquarter the company in Orange County, Calif., rather than the Bay Area. Luckey says many conservatives, in the minority in Silicon Valley, are silent about their political views for fear of the consequences it could have on their careers down the line.\u00a0\u201cMost conservatives in Silicon Valley are not being ostracized in any way,\u201d Luckey said. \u201cBecause nobody knows they\u2019re a conservative because they dare not tell anyone.\u201d Luckey\u00a0couldn\u2019t keep his own personal politics hidden at this point if he wanted to. The 26-year-old who already made a fortune through the sale of his previous company Oculus to Facebook for $2 billion in 2014\u00a0was at the center of one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most high-profile political controversies. During the 2016 election he contributed $10,000 to Nimble America, an anti-Hillary Clinton group that promoted far-right memes. He was subsequently fired from Facebook and according to the Wall Street Journal, he has told people the social network's decision was\u00a0due to his support for Donald Trump. After co-founding Anduril\u00a0in 2017, Luckey is trying to temper that image with a push for bipartisan pragmatism at the border. If the parties could reach a consensus on border tech, Luckey certainly stands to benefit.\u00a0 \u201cWe should understand what\u2019s happening on the border, no matter what we believe the policies should be,\u201d Luckey told me. \u201cRepublicans and Democrats both support this.\u201d Amid the border security negotiations, Rep. James E. Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat, has proposed funding for border security technology that would involve drones, scanners, and sensors \u201cto create a technological barrier too high to climb over, too wide to go around, and too deep to burrow under,\u201d according to McClatchy. But it's\u00a0unlikely that\u00a0Trump would accept a tech-based alternative to his long-held promises for a physical barrier at the Southern border. He has previously railed against such suggestions on Twitter: Luckey, for his part, says the country needs both. \u00a0Anduril currently has a system deployed with U.S. Customs and Border Protection near San Diego, and it will be expanding its systems in California this month under a new contract. It also has a test deployment set up in West Texas. \u201cThere are areas where we need physical infrastructure, but I don\u2019t think we need it across the entire border,\u201d Luckey said. \u201cWhat you do want is the ability to know what\u2019s happening along the entire border.\u201d Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos in Washington on Sept. 13, 2018. (Cliff Owen\/AP) BITS: Bezos has repeatedly\u00a0drawn criticism and threats from Trump but nobody has made more money than the Amazon chief executive since the 2016 election, Bloomberg News's\u00a0Justin Sink reported.\u00a0In fact, Bezos has become the world's richest person since Trump was elected president: His\u00a0net worth has increased by\u00a0$66.2 billion through Friday since the 2016 election. \u201cBezos\u2019s wealth was valued at $134.8 billion, making his fortune a third bigger than Bill Gates\u2019s, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index,\u201d\u00a0Sink reported.\u00a0 Trump has\u00a0threatened Amazon with antitrust enforcement, higher taxes and higher shipping fees but the threats haven't materialized so far, Bloomberg News reported.

(Mario Tama\/Getty Images) NIBBLES: Some electric scooter and bike companies are issuing punitive fees on some users to curb practices such as parking in an unauthorized area or hoarding equipment, according to the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Yuliya Chernova. For instance, the electric scooter rental firm Lime, which is experimenting with penalties in some cities, said the fines aim to abide by local rules and put an end to unwanted practices by riders. In theory, Lime's fines can range from $5 to $2,000 but the company said the highest fee it has imposed is $100, according to the Journal. Yet some customers have criticized the penalties and the way the companies impose them. \u201cI felt like they put me in a position that was really unfair,\u201d Ben Terrell, who faced a $100 penalty from Lime for allegedly hoarding a scooter after using Lime three times in November last year in Los Angeles, told the Journal. \u201cI did what they told me to do, and even though I followed the rules, I was still being punished.\u201d\u00a0Terrell said that he was reimbursed following a complaint. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg in Washington on Sept. 5, 2018. (Jim Watson\/AFP\/Getty Images) BYTES: The Washington Post's Geoffrey A. Fowler and others have suggested Facebook consider a paid\u00a0version of its services as the company grapples with privacy scandals. On its 15th birthday, the Information's Reed Albergotti reported that's long been a consideration at the company. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2012 asked colleagues whether the social network should consider a subscription-based version of its service, but Facebook\u00a0Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg disagreed with the idea and her position prevailed. Sandberg and others at Facebook who shared her position\u00a0considered that if Facebook launched a subscription version, the free version of the platform would become less attractive for advertisers.\u00a0 The problem of whether and how to police\u00a0content on Facebook also emerged in the years preceding Facebook's 2012\u00a0initial public offering\u00a0as some employees worried about abuse on the platform, but the company didn't not move to massively hire content moderators at the time, the Information reported.\u00a0\u201cOn several occasions, when confronted about the problems with content on the platform, such as hate speech, bullying and disinformation, Ms. Sandberg dismissed the issue entirely, repeating the mantra that the platform \u2018polices itself,\u2019 because users could report bad behavior by other users,\u201d\u00a0Albergotti wrote.

Manager: Dave Roberts (fourth season). He\u2019s Here: CF A.J. Pollock, RHP Joe Kelly, C Russell Martin, LHP Adam McCreery.

Projected Lineup: LF Joc Pederson (.248, 25 HRs, 56 RBIs) or LF-2B-SS Chris Taylor (.254, 17, 63, team-high 178 Ks in 155 games), 3B Justin Turner (.312, 14, 52), SS Corey Seager (.267, 2, 13 in 26 games before elbow and hip operations), 1B-2B Max Muncy (.263, 35, 79, .973 OPS) or 1B-3B David Freese (.282, 9, 42 with Pirates; .385, 2, 9 with Dodgers), CF A.J. Pollock (.257, 21, 65 with Arizona), RF Cody Bellinger (.260, 25, 76, 151 Ks in 162 games), 2B-SS-OF Enrique Hernandez (.256, 21, 52), C Austin Barnes (.205, 4, 14 in 200 ABs) or Russell Martin (.194, 10, 25 with Toronto). Rotation: LH Clayton Kershaw (9-5, 2.73 ERA, team-high 155 Ks), RH Walker Buehler (8-5, 2.62, 151 Ks in 137 1\/3 IP), LH Rich Hill (11-5, 3.66, 150 Ks), LH Hyun-Jin Ryu (7-3, 1.97), RH Kenta Maeda (8-10, 3.81), RH Ross Stripling (8-6, 3.02, 136 Ks). Key Relievers: RH Kenley Jansen (1-5, 3.01, 38\/42 saves), RH Pedro Baez (4-3, 2.88), RH Joe Kelly (4-2, 4.39 with Boston), LH Caleb Ferguson (7-2, 3.49, 2 saves), RH Dylan Floro (3-1, 1.63), LH Scott Alexander (2-1, 3.68), RH J.T. Chargois (2-4, 3.34), LH Tony Cingrani (1-2, 4.76), RH Yimi Garcia (1-2, 5.64), LH Julio Urias (0-0, 0.00, 7 Ks, 4 IP in 3 games after returning from shoulder injury). Hot Spot: Sore Arms. Kershaw won\u2019t start on opening day and is expected to begin the season on the injured list, ending his streak of pitching eight straight openers. The three-time Cy Young Award winner dealt with left shoulder inflammation during spring training. Buehler, coming off a stellar rookie season, had a sore shoulder early this spring and didn\u2019t make his first Cactus League appearance until there was a week left in camp. Those injuries, in addition Cingrani opening the season on the injured list, could present Urias with a role working multiple innings in relief. Urias gained valuable experience in the 2018 postseason. Outlook: Roberts received a contract extension through 2022, and the Dodgers are favorites to win a seventh straight NL West title. Seager is expected to be ready for opening day, having recovered from Tommy John surgery and a hip operation. Martin, a four-time All-Star who helped lead Los Angeles to three straight playoff appearances during his first stint with the team from 2006-10, will add a veteran presence to the clubhouse. Jansen had a heart procedure during the offseason and is looking to return to dominance. Pollock signed a $55 million, four-year deal in January to be the everyday center fielder. Kelly came over from Boston to be the setup man for Jansen. ___ Colorado Rockies 2018: 91-72, second place, wild card, lost to Milwaukee in Division Series. Manager: Bud Black (third season). He\u2019s Here: 1B Daniel Murphy, 1B Mark Reynolds. He\u2019s Outta Here: 2B DJ LeMahieu, RHP Adam Ottavino, OF Carlos Gonzalez, OF Matt Holliday, OF Gerardo Parra, C Drew Butera. Projected Lineup: RF Charlie Blackmon (.291, 29 HRs, 70 RBIs), 3B Nolan Arenado (.297, 38, 110), 1B Daniel Murphy (.299, 12, 42 with Nationals and Cubs), SS Trevor Story (.291, 37, 108), LF David Dahl (.273, 16, 48), CF Ian Desmond (.236, 22, 88), 2B Ryan McMahon (.232, 5, 19 in 181 ABs), C Chris Iannetta (.224, 11, 36). Rotation: LH Kyle Freeland (17-7, 2.85 ERA, lowest full-season ERA for starting pitcher in team history), RH German Marquez (14-11, 3.76, club-record 230 Ks), RH Jon Gray (12-9, 5.12, 183 Ks), LH Tyler Anderson (7-9, 4.55), RH Antonio Senzatela (6-6, 4.38) or RH Chad Bettis (5-2, 5.06 as starter and reliever). Key Relievers: RH Wade Davis (3-6, 4.13, led NL with team-record 43\/49 saves), RH Scott Oberg (8-1, 2.46), RH Seunghwan Oh (2-0, 2.57 with Rockies; 4-3, 2.68 with Toronto), LH Chris Rusin (2-3, 6.20), LH Jake McGee (2-4, 6.49), RH Bryan Shaw (4-6, 5.93), LH Mike Dunn (0-0, 9.00 in 25 games). Hot Spot: Second Base. Colorado could take a look at McMahon, Garrett Hampson or Pat Valaika to fill the void left by LeMahieu, who\u2019s now with the New York Yankees. On the horizon could be prospect Brendan Rodgers, a first-round draft pick in 2015. Outlook: The Rockies were certainly busy this spring, locking up Arenado with a $260 million, eight-year contract and signing Black to an extension that runs through the 2022 season. Now, they have to prove to Arenado they\u2019re serious about winning. The four-time All-Star and six-time Gold Glove winner can opt out after the 2021 season. This team made has it to the playoffs two straight seasons for the first time in franchise history, but the Rockies are still chasing their first NL West title. They\u2019re switching things up by moving Blackmon from center field to right and sending Desmond from first base to center. Murphy will step in at first base. It\u2019s a formidable lineup from top to bottom, with Arenado moving to the No. 2 spot. Story is coming off the best of his three big league seasons after hitting 37 homers and stealing 27 bases in 2018. He also made his first All-Star appearance. \u201cWe\u2019re heading in the right direction,\u201d Story said. ___ Arizona Diamondbacks 2018: 82-80, third place. Manager: Torey Lovullo (third season). He\u2019s Here: RHP Luke Weaver, C Carson Kelly, OF Adam Jones, INF Wilmer Flores, RHP Greg Holland. He\u2019s Outta Here: 1B Paul Goldschmidt, CF A.J. Pollock, LHP Patrick Corbin, C Jeff Mathis, INF Daniel Descalso, RHP Clay Buchholz, OF Jon Jay, INF-OF Chris Owings, RHP Brad Boxberger, RHP Randall Delgado, LHP Jake Diekman, RHP Shelby Miller, RHP Brad Ziegler, C Chris Stewart. Projected Lineup: 2B Ketel Marte (.260, 14 HRs, 59 RBIs), 3B Eduardo Escobar (.272, 23, 84 with Minnesota and Arizona), LF David Peralta (.293, 30, 84), RF Steven Souza Jr. (.220, 5, 29), 1B Jake Lamb (.222, 6, 31), CF Adam Jones (.281, 15, 63 with Baltimore), SS Nick Ahmed (.234, 16, 70), C Carson Kelly (.114, 0, 3 with St. Louis). Rotation: RH Zack Greinke (15-11 3.21 ERA), LH Robbie Ray (6-2, 3.93), RH Zack Godley (15-11, 4.74), RH Luke Weaver (7-11, 4.95 with St. Louis), RH Merrill Kelly (first big league season). Key Relievers: RH Archie Bradley (4-5, 3.64, 3 saves), RH Greg Holland (2-2, 4.66 with St. Louis and Washington), RH Yoshihisa Hirano (4-3, 2.44), RH Andrew Chafin (1-6, 3.10). Hot Spot: Closer. The competition between Bradley and Holland was underwhelming through the spring as both candidates struggled. Bradley had some issues in late innings last season and has been bothered by a stiff neck this spring, but has a high-velocity fastball and the personality for the closer\u2019s role. Holland was once one of baseball\u2019s best closers before getting injured, but had an up-and-down 2018 season. Outlook: The Diamondbacks are hoping to contend again, even with Goldschmidt in St. Louis. Losing one of baseball\u2019s best players and a fan favorite is a huge hit, though Arizona still has some quality players and added veterans such as Jones and Flores. The Diamondbacks are hoping Lamb can make the transition from third base to first and regain the form he had before shoulder surgery last season. ___ San Francisco Giants 2018: 73-89, fourth place. Manager: Bruce Bochy (13th season). He\u2019s Here: LHP Drew Pomeranz, OF Gerardo Parra, C Rene Rivera, OF Cameron Maybin, C Stephen Vogt, LHP Travis Bergen, INF Yangervis Solarte. He\u2019s Outta Here: OF Hunter Pence, OF Gregor Blanco, OF Gorkys Hernandez, C Nick Hundley, RHP Hunter Strickland, RHP Derek Law. Projected Lineup: CF Steven Duggar (.255, 2 HRs, 17 RBIs), 2B Joe Panik (.254, 4, 24), C Buster Posey (.284, 5, 41), 1B Brandon Belt (.253, 14, 46), 3B Evan Longoria (.244, 16, 54), SS Brandon Crawford (.254, 14, 54), RF Gerardo Parra (.284, 6, 53 with Rockies), LF Mac Williamson (.213, 4, 11). Rotation: LH Madison Bumgarner (6-7, 3.26 ERA), LH Derek Holland (7-9, 3.57), RH Dereck Rodriguez (6-4, 2.81), LH Drew Pomeranz (2-6, 6.08 with Red Sox), RH Jeff Samardzija (1-5, 6.25). Key Relievers: LH Will Smith (2-3, 2.55, 14\/18 saves), LH Tony Watson (4-6, 2.59), RH Mark Melancon (1-4, 3.23, 3 saves), RH Sam Dyson (4-3, 2.69, 3 saves), LH Reyes Moronta (5-2, 2.49, 1 save). Hot Spot: Outfield. After making a failed run in free agency at Bryce Harper, the Giants go into the season with no power in their outfield. The projected starters combined for just 12 homers last season, and Parra\u2019s 14 long balls in 2015 are the most for any of the three in a single season. Not exactly like the old days when Barry Bonds could hit that many in a month. Even the possible reserves such as Maybin and Austin Slater aren\u2019t exactly sluggers, giving little hope that there\u2019s an answer for 2019 in the organization. Outlook: The Giants are a team in transition after a two-year stretch of 187 losses that was the worst for the franchise since 1984-85. Bochy has already announced this is his last season after winning three World Series titles in San Francisco. Farhan Zaidi was hired as president of baseball operations but didn\u2019t make a splash in his first offseason, with the biggest addition being Pomeranz, who struggled last season for Boston. There\u2019s even uncertainty regarding ownership, with President and CEO Larry Baer on a leave of absence after the release of a video showing him in a physical altercation with his wife. There are still a few key pieces left from a team that made the playoffs in 2016, most notably Posey, Bumgarner, Crawford and Belt. But with Posey coming off hip surgery and Bumgarner a possible trade candidate in the final year of his deal, that core might not be in place for long, either. The rotation is lacking behind Bumgarner, with Johnny Cueto recovering from Tommy John surgery. With few high-end prospects in the upper ranks of the minors, the Giants appear to be in for another rebuilding year and could be in line to win fewer than 75 games in three straight full seasons for the first time since 1900-02. ___ San Diego Padres 2018: 66-96, fifth place. Manager: Andy Green (fourth season). He\u2019s Here: 3B Manny Machado, 2B Ian Kinsler, INF Greg Garcia, RHP Garrett Richards. He\u2019s Outta Here: SS Freddy Galvis, LHP Clayton Richard, INF Carlos Asuaje, C A.J. Ellis. Projected Lineup: 2B Ian Kinsler (.240, 14 HRs, 48 RBIs with Angels and Red Sox), 1B Eric Hosmer (.253, 18, 69), 3B Manny Machado (.297, 37, 107 with Orioles and Dodgers), RF Franmil Reyes (.280, 16, 31), CF Wil Myers (.253, 11, 39), LF Hunter Renfroe (.248, 26, 68), SS Luis Urias (.208, 2, 5 in 12 games), C Austin Hedges (.231, 14, 37). Rotation: LH Joey Lucchesi (8-9, 4.08 ERA), LH Eric Lauer (6-7, 4.34), RH Chris Paddack (7-3, 2.10 at Class A and Double-A), LH Matt Strahm (3-4, 2.05), LH Logan Allen (14-6, 2.54 at Double-A and Triple-A) or RH Cal Quantrill (9-6, 4.80 at Double-A and Triple-A). Key Relievers: RH Kirby Yates (5-3, 2.14, 12 saves), RH Craig Stammen (8-3, 2.73), RH Robert Stock (1-1, 2.50), RH Adam Warren (3-2, 3.14 with Yankees and Mariners), LH Aaron Loup (0-0, 4.54 with Toronto and Philadelphia), RH Phil Maton (0-2, 4.37), LH Robbie Erlin (4-7, 4.21), RH Bryan Mitchell (2-4, 5.42). Hot Spot: Starting Rotation. It\u2019s still young and somewhat inexperienced. Lucchesi and Lauer made their big league debuts last season. Paddack wowed everyone at spring training and most likely won a spot. Lucchesi is expected to make the opening day start against San Francisco at Petco Park. Fans will see more and more of the farm system\u2019s vaunted pitchers, starting with Paddack and likely including Allen and Quantrill. Outlook: The signing of Machado to a $300 million, 10-year contract made the Padres relevant, even if they do miss the playoffs for the 13th straight year. It at least gets them closer to expectations of being competitive by next season or 2021. The next big addition is expected to be top prospect Fernando Tatis Jr., the 20-year-old shortstop and son of a former big leaguer. Tatis is expected to make his debut at some point this season. Hosmer, whose $144 million, eight-year deal had been the team\u2019s biggest contract before the Machado signing, is looking for a bounce-back season after struggling in his first year with San Diego. Myers moves from third base, where he struggled late last season, back to center field. ___","76":"As President Trump consulted with administration officials Wednesday over whether Boeing\u2019s 737 Max jetliners should be grounded after a crash killed more than 150 passengers in Ethiopia over the weekend, he shared his pointed opinion of the type of plane in question. In his words, it \u201csucked.\u201d The president said Boeing 737s paled in comparison to the Boeing 757, known as Trump Force One, which he owns as a personal jet, according to White House and transportation officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. He questioned why Boeing would keep building the model and opined that he never would have bought a 737 for the Trump Shuttle, the small airline he briefly ran three decades ago that relied on 727s before going bankrupt, the officials said. Later in the day, Trump agreed with his aides that the Federal Aviation Administration, as the industry regulator, should formally announce the decision to ground the 737 Max planes, according to two White House officials. But when reporters were brought into the White House for a previously scheduled immigration event, he scrapped the plan. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition to ground all flights of the 737 Max 8 and the 737 Max 9 and the planes associated with that line,\u201d Trump announced, catching some industry officials by surprise. The chaotic scene capped a harried three-day period in which the United States lagged almost every other major country in deciding how to respond to an Ethi\u00ado\u00adpian Airlines crash early Sunday, highlighting the Trump administration\u2019s close ties to Boeing and its difficulty asserting itself as a global leader in the wake of a tragedy. As governments in China, Australia, the European Union and elsewhere were moving to ground the 737 Max plane on Monday and Tuesday, Trump and his administration were in a holding pattern. The president held daily phone calls with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and other stakeholders, offering his self-proclaimed expertise in public and private. On Twitter, he declared that \u201cairplanes are becoming far too complex to fly.\u201d Trump added to the confusion Wednesday by suggesting that the decision to ground the plane was \u201cpsychologically\u201d important but was neither urgent nor conclusive. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to make this decision today. We could have delayed it,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cWe maybe didn\u2019t have to make it at all. But I felt it was important both psychologically and in a lot of other ways.\u201d The equivocation reflected an administration that was reluctant to take the step of imposing a nationwide suspension initially opposed by Boeing, the country\u2019s second-largest federal contractor. Trump was inclined to announce a grounding on Tuesday, but he received pushback from the FAA, which had not yet reached a decision, according to officials familiar with the deliberations. But Trump also equivocated himself, telling advisers that grounding planes would cause panic and could hurt the stock market, according to two people who spoke to him. Federal regulators usually take the lead on making decisions related to safety, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group. \u201cIt\u2019s not the president\u2019s decision and it should never be the president\u2019s decision,\u201d he said, adding that he did not know whether Trump broke any protocols. On Tuesday, as a growing number of countries were grounding the planes, Trump spoke to Muilenburg, who argued in favor of keeping the planes in the sky, according to a senior administration official. Boeing was facing increasing global pressure after reports showed that pilots had complained about the plane\u2019s automation system. On Tuesday night, officials said, Trump was given satellite data that indicated the same 737 Max automation system believed to be responsible for a crash in Indonesia last year that killed more than 180 people may have played a role in Sunday\u2019s accident. By Wednesday morning, officials said, Trump had also seen information about the crash from the Canadian government, which then announced it was grounding the model, leaving the U.S. as the only major country where the aircraft was being allowed to operate. \u201cWe were coordinating with Canada,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cWe were giving them information, they were giving us information.\u201d Throughout the process, Trump played the role of aviation expert, despite having no formal training in aeronautics. Trump told advisers about the dynamics and equipment of various airplanes, comparing them to his 757. \u201cHe was very much engaged in this,\u201d one official said. Trump, who claims to have personally renegotiated Boeing\u2019s contract to build Air Force One, relinquished his failed Trump Shuttle between Boston, New York and Washington in 1991 after never making a profit. His criticism of the 737 \u2014 the best-selling jetliner model in history \u2014 came just weeks after he attended an event in Hanoi celebrating Vietnam\u2019s purchase of 100 of the Boeing jets. Trump expressed condolences Wednesday for the victims of the Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia crash. \u201cOur hearts go out to all of those who lost loved ones, to their friends, to their families, in both the Ethiopian and Lion Airlines that involved the 737 Max aircraft,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible thing.\u201d In deciding to ground the Boeing model, Trump said that Muilenburg, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and acting FAA administrator Daniel K. Elwell were \u201call in agreement.\u201d Daniel Wells, who sits on the board of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations, said Trump should not have been the person making the announcement. \u201cThe president isn\u2019t the right person to do it. Elwell or Chao should have made the announcement,\u201d said Wells, whose 30,000-member group did not call for the planes to be grounded. \u201cBut it was Trump who said it. That tells you everything you need to know.\u201d Boeing, which as late as Tuesday said publicly it saw no reason to ground the planes, announced soon after Trump made his move that it had recommended the grounding. \u201cWe are supporting this proactive step out of an abundance of caution,\u201d Muilenburg said in a statement. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again.\u201d Boeing has a long history of developing close relationships with U.S. presidents. In 2015, President Obama told Seattle TV station KING-TV that he was probably the second-biggest global salesman for Boeing, which he called \u201can iconic company.\u201d The company donated $1 million each to the inaugural funds of Trump and Obama. Boeing has an especially close relationship with the Trump administration, which has recruited several company executives for senior posts, including acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. Muilenburg has courted Trump at the White House, at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., and at Trump Tower in New York. Trump has twice visited Boeing facilities and praised the company\u2019s aircraft. \u201cGod bless Boeing,\u201d Trump said after touring a company facility in Charleston, S.C., in February 2017. \u201cGreat planes,\u201d he told reporters while visiting a St. Louis facility in March 2018. \u201cIncredible. Great company.\u201d He has also personally pitched the company\u2019s planes in meetings with world leaders from Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and other countries. \u201cGreatest commercial aircraft in the world,\u201d he said in November 2017 while meeting with Japanese business leaders. He noted that after the United States, Japan is the largest owner of Boeing aircraft. Trump also offered a dose of praise for the company as he made his announcement grounding its plane. \u201cBoeing is an incredible company,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are working very, very hard right now. And hopefully they will very quickly come up with the answer. But until they do, the planes are grounded.\u201d","77":"It's Friday.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Joe Biden.\u00a0Klobuchar's campaign did not get back to us on whether or not she now supports legalizing recreational marijuana use on the federal level. President Trump wants to leave legalization up to the states, though his Justice Department under ex-Attorney General Jeff Sessions pursued the opposite course. Candidates like Klobuchar, and prospective ones like Brown and Biden,\u00a0might face issues\u00a0with the pro-cannabis electorate, according to cannabis advocates and experts we spoke with.

Tuesday\u2019s charges are unrelated to McGowan\u2019s generosity on Friday, when he bought an entire stock of cookies from Girl Scouts in front of a Greenville, S.C., grocery store so the girls wouldn\u2019t have to continue standing in the cold. \u201cNobody was hurt.

On Friday, the 8-year-olds were behind the booth for nearly two hours when a man believed to be McGowan exited the BI-LO supermarket.

(Jason Lee\/Reuters) The United States\u2019 top cyber diplomat just offered an unusually blunt warning to other nations: Allowing\u00a0Huawei and other Chinese companies into their next-generation telecommunications networks would allow Beijing to expand its surveillance state around much of the globe. The argument\u00a0from Rob Strayer, the State Department\u2019s top cyber official, was the most elaborate public case a U.S. official has made against Huawei\u2019s inclusion in 5G networks. It follows a months-long pressure campaign by U.S. officials to ban the Chinese telecom giant\u00a0from 5G in Canada, Britain, Europe and elsewhere. \u201cA country that uses data in the way China has \u2014 to surveil its citizens, to set up credit scores and to imprison more than 1 million people for their ethnic and religious background \u2014 should give us pause about the way that country might use data in the future,\u201d Strayer said Wednesday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. \u201cIt would be naive to think that country, [given] the influence it has over its companies, would act in ways that would treat our citizens better than it treats its own citizens.\u201d The Trump administration is considering an executive order that would effectively allow it to ban Huawei and other Chinese companies from U.S. telecom systems, but even that wouldn't fully protect U.S. information because data moves so easily across national borders.\u00a0Even sensitive U.S. government information would remain vulnerable if officials were communicating with allies who allowed Huawei on their 5G networks, Strayer said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much data flowing around the world, it\u2019s impossible to just isolate one country\u2019s networks and think: \u2018That\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fine,' \" he said. The transition to 5G, which is in its earliest stages, will mark a massive development in mobile technology. It will offer far faster download speeds and the ability to run billions more devices on mobile networks, including smart devices such as autonomous vehicles and powerful artificial intelligence systems. While it will be five or more years before the sytem is fully operational, a lot of the contracts to create its basic building blocks will be negotiated this year.\u00a0 That exponential increase in connectivity, however, will also \u201cdramatically increase the networks\u2019 threat vectors and attack surfaces,\u201d Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, told me \u2014 especially if a U.S. adversary controls large portions of it. China could leverage Huawei\u2019s position in 5G networks to steal \u201ctrillions\u201d of dollars of intellectual property, Strayer noted, or to implant malware on adversaries\u2019 networks. It could even shut down parts of those networks amid geopolitical conflicts. Strayer\u2019s concerns would apply to any Chinese company, he noted, though Huawei is, by far, the most prominent example. The move against Huawei isn\u2019t limited to 5G developments. \u00a0 Congress banned the company from U.S. government networks last year amid fears it would be used as a Chinese government spying tool and the Federal Communications Commission has proposed a rule that would allow it to ban the company from smaller networks that accept federal grants, where the company has its strongest foothold. The Justice Department also indicted Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer and two affiliates in January, alleging a host of crimes, including stealing robotics technology from T-Mobile and violating sanctions against Iran. But the United States\u2019 international lobbying campaign against Huawei goes a step further, seeking to restrict China from playing a key role in an entire generation of digital development. Its success or failure could determine the fate of Internet security for years, Strayer said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking to partners around the world about this as they upgrade to 5G. We\u2019re raising it at the highest diplomatic levels,\u201d Strayer said. \u201cThe generational nature of 5G, the transformational nature of it means there will be a whole generation of lock-in.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security logo in Washington on May 11, 2017.

Penetrating the systems of such service providers can allow hackers to move into the networks of the\u00a0client companies. \u201cTheir strategies have shifted from labor-intensive, one-off compromises of individual targets to the use of the force-multiplier effects that enable them to compromise multiple targets through a single attack,\u201d Booth said, according to CyberScoop's Sean Lyngaas. \u201cThat shift in strategies increases the risk for all of us.\u201d As FCW reported, the hacking campaign mainly targets businesses whose activities fall within Beijing's \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d policy that aims to make the country a leader in emerging\u00a0technologies, according to U.S. officials.

On Wednesday, the central bank cut its growth forecasts, left interest rates unchanged and indicated it won\u2019t do any hikes this year.\u201d In practical terms, what does this mean? \u201cThe Fed entered 2019 predicting the economy would grow 2.3 percent and two more rate hikes would be necessary to keep the economy from overheating. On Wednesday, the Fed cut its growth forecast to 2.1 percent, and the vast majority of Fed leaders now predict no interest rate increases this year.\u201d President Trump will get his wish: no further rate cuts. However, the larger problem for him and the Republican Party remains. As a political matter, if 2019 and 2020 turn out to be minimal growth years, leading wages and job creation to stagnate, the sole \u201caccomplishment\u201d for Trump \u2014 the economy \u2014 could well become a hindrance, not a help, next year. As a more substantive matter, it\u2019s time to call foul on the GOP\u2019s economic theory, which justifies giving tax cuts to the rich and to corporations while driving up the debt. Trump said that the tax cuts would pay for themselves; on the contrary, the deficit is heading for a record high. Trump said that the tax cuts would somehow fundamentally alter the economy, kicking us into a permanent mode of 3 percent growth. That\u2019s not in the cards. Moreover, Democrats and some Republicans will argue that the slowdown is Trump\u2019s doing \u2014 the inevitable result of running up huge deficits, starting a trade war, and failing to invest in infrastructure and workers. Indeed, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell suggested that now is a poor time to pick fights with trading partners: Now we see a situation where the European economy has slowed substantially and so has the Chinese economy, although the European economy more,\" he said in response to a question from CNBC\u2019s Steve Liesman. \u201cJust as strong global growth was a tailwind, weaker global growth can be a headwind to our economy.\u201d One definitely gets the sense that we are seeing the possible end if not substantial tapering of a 10-year recovery. (\u201cIn its post-meeting statement, the [Federal Open Market Committee] characterized the labor market as \u2018strong\u2019 but said the \u2018growth of economic activity has slowed,\u2019 a U-turn from January when the FOMC said activity \u2018has been rising at a solid rate.\u2019 \u201d) Whatever the magic formula might be, it was Trump who guaranteed 3 percent growth. It\u2019s Trump who will be held accountable, just as his bragging about the stock market made him politically vulnerable when the market hit the skids at the end of last year. Democrats should be restrained in their reaction. The economy is not in a recession (yet), and unemployment remains low, by historic standards. The better political argument is the honest policy assessment: You cannot have a strong economy over the long haul by accelerating income inequality, starving government of adequate revenue to promote long-term investments and going to war with trading partners. In other words, economic policies that Trump specifically adopted (in a reversal of President Barack Obama) may be the very things that foreshorten the recovery. Economist Jared Bernstein, formerly a senior adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, told me, \u201cAs fiscal stimulus fades, I expect growth to slow this year. But I still don\u2019t foresee a near-term recession.\u201d He said that for now, \u201cthe labor market and the consumer are still in solid shape.\u201d Democrats should not cheer the end of good times. They should say that Trump failed to deliver and then propose their own policies that promote growth, invest in workers, repair infrastructure and lessen the gap between rich and poor. So have we put a stake in supply-side economics, which has never permanently altered the economy\u2019s growth trajectory? Bernstein joked, \u201cIf facts could kill supply-side economics I\u2019d have given its graveside eulogy decades ago. It is a zombie ideology that lives on because its beneficiaries hire politicians to believe it.\u201d We will take that as a \u201cno.\u201d","81":"THE KEY Sen.

It\u2019s going to be far harder after the 35-day government shutdown that furloughed about half the Homeland Security Department\u2019s main cyber agency and required the other half to work without pay, Johnson told me in an interview. \u201cThis is not helping the federal government\u2019s ability to attract and retain people in some very important positions that require a fair amount of sacrifice,\u201d Johnson told me. Johnson\u00a0says he\u00a0wants the Senate to consider a wide range of incentives for government cyber workers including raised pay and more flexibility to move from agency to agency to share their expertise and gain new skills. Concerns that government is losing the race for top cyber talent are\u00a0long-standing in government\u00a0but Congress, so far, has done little to mend the situation. Frustration over the shutdown, however, may spark an exodus that necessitates action. Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, fretted in a Monday\u00a0letter\u00a0to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen that \u201cshutdowns like this one have the effect of discouraging talented individuals from joining the Federal workforce, and [push] some of our best toward alluring careers in the private sector.\u201d Caitlin Durkovich, a former DHS assistant secretary with cyber responsibilities, called on Congress during a mid-shutdown panel discussion hosted by the House Homeland Security Committee to \u201crethink the civil service system to make sure we can get the best and the brightest, that they\u2019re well paid, that they have benefits and that they have the flexibility we have in the private sector.\u201d\u00a0 Retaining cyber workers will take more than a single fix, Johnson told me. As a first move, Johnson said, he plans to focus on creating a fast track for civilian government cyber workers to rotate between agencies. The committee\u2019s new ranking Democrat, Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.) introduced during the last Congress\u00a0a\u00a0bill\u00a0that would allow this\u00a0\u2014 and\u00a0told me in December\u00a0that he\u2019s also interested in renewing it. The goal of the program, which is based on military joint duty systems, is to \u201cboost collaboration between agencies\u201d and to help employees \u201cenhance their careers and broaden their cybersecurity expertise,\u201d Peters said in a statement. Johnson also wants Congress to consider boosting pay for cyber workers outside the normal range for federal employees, he told me. That\u2019s going to be a tough sell because of agreements with employee unions and because many other categories of federal workers consider themselves underpaid, Johnson acknowledged. \u201cThere will be the question: \u2018Why are these people special?\u2019\u201d Johnson told me. \u201cYou do risk opening up a large can of worms. But, to a certain extent, the marketplace has to dictate it.\u201d Congress should also consider allowing some carve-outs for top cyber officials from an Obama-era law that\u00a0requires\u00a0top federal leaders to divest from stocks in areas where they might have insider knowledge and to publicly report contents of their stock portfolios, Johnson told me. That bill, the STOCK Act, which was primarily aimed at halting insider trading by members of Congress, won large bipartisan majorities when it\u00a0passed\u00a0in 2012. Before making other proposals, Johnson said, he wants to hold numerous hearings and gather data about how bad the cyber workforce problem is and if it's affecting some parts of government more than others. \u201cWe really need to examine to what extent we\u2019re not able to attract talent, to what extent we have very high turnover, going through the problem-solving process, gathering information and describing reality before we can really describe a solution,\u201d he said.

Targets included human rights activists,\u00a0governments and militants\u00a0\u2014 but\u00a0also Americans. \u201cI don\u2019t think Americans should be doing this to other Americans,\u201d Lori Stroud, a former intelligence analyst for the National Security Agency who took part in\u00a0Project Raven, told Reuters. \u201cI\u2019m a spy, I get that.

Ron Johnson\u00a0(R-Wis.) on Capitol Hill in Washington on Nov. 7, 2017. (Susan Walsh\/AP)\u00a0 -- Another major oversight priority for the Homeland Security Committee this Congress will be making sure DHS is effectively implementing a new law aimed at keeping government\u2019s technology supply chain free from cybersecurity risks,\u00a0Johnson told me. Congress approved that law after passing separate government bans for the Russian anti-virus company Kaspersky and the Chinese telecoms Huawei and ZTE. Going forward, Johnson told me, he wants to make sure the intelligence community is sharing information with DHS about digital spying threats so questionable companies can be barred from government network as quickly as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Johnson also wants to dig into reports that Homeland Security\u2019s system for detecting and preventing government-wide cyber threats is catching only a small percentage of intrusion attempts, he told me.

The company released its financial details for the first time on Friday, giving the public a glimpse into its performance before deciding whether to buy into the ride-hailing phenomenon. Lyft reported $2.2 billion in revenue last year \u2014 more than double its $1.1 billion in revenue in 2017. That continued a growth trajectory that saw revenue skyrocket more than 200 percent in 2017 compared with 2016, when the company brought in $343.3 million. But Lyft is still losing money and its executives warned it may struggle to turn a profit, according to Friday\u2019s filing. The company lost $911 million last year and nearly $3 billion in total since 2012 while raking in $5.1 billion in venture capital. Its cash balance also is shrinking. Lyft had $517 million in cash and equivalents at the end of last year, about half of what it had at the end of 2017. Lyft has been in a race with Uber to be first to offer its stock to the public, and has positioned itself as the affable alternative to its larger and more ubiquitous rival. Uber, which struggled with public relations setbacks in the past, expects to file its IPO later this year. Together, the two could raise billions of dollars to fuel their expansions and give investors an opportunity to see how the companies plan to become sustainable. Lyft\u2019s filing says that its co-founders \u2014 CEO Logan Green, 35, and President John Zimmer, 34 \u2014 will keep significant control of the company after it goes public and \u201cwill be able to significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders,\u201d including the election of board members, a merger, asset sales or other major corporate transactions. The company\u2019s share of the U.S. ride-hailing market was 39 percent in December 2018, up from 22 percent in December 2016, according to the filing, which cited growth from new drivers and riders as well as increased ride frequency. It reported 30.7 million riders and 1.9 million drivers in more than 300 cities in 2018, and has given more than 1 billion rides since its inception in 2012, according to the filing. Lyft\u2019s market-share gains in recent years came at a time when Uber was dogged by reports that drivers accosted passengers and that the company allowed rampant sexual harassment internally \u2014 revelations that ultimately led its co-founder Travis Kalanick to resign. Uber has been working to repair its image under CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who tweeted congratulations to the Lyft team Friday, calling it \u201ca big moment for ridesharing!\u201d Lyft allowed customers to tip drivers earlier than Uber, building into its brand the sense that it treats drivers better than its main competitor. In its filing, Lyft said it will pay cash bonuses of $1,000 and $10,000 to drivers who meet certain criteria, and that drivers may use those bonuses to buy the company\u2019s shares. Bookings \u2014 the amount of money spent by customers, minus taxes, fees and tolls \u2014 are rising dramatically, which Lyft will try to emphasize to investors. The company had just over $8 billion in bookings last year, 76 percent more than in 2017 and more than four times the number from 2016. \u201cWe believe this is a key indicator of the utility of transportation solutions provided through our multimodal platform, as well as the scale and growth in our business,\u201d the company said in the filing. Lyft, known for the pink moustaches that used to adorn car grilles, was valued at just over $15 billion last year. In addition to ride-hailing, it offers shared car, bike and scooter rides. By being the first company in the ride-hailing category to go public, Lyft is likely to attract institutional investors who want to get in on the sector, said Rohit Kulkarni, senior vice president of research at Forge. Based on the figures in the filing, and assuming steady revenue growth of more than 50 percent in the next year, institutional investors are likely to value Lyft at $20 billion to $25 billion, he said. The next step is for Lyft managers to go on the road to woo investors, presenting details and fielding questions from potential buyers in hopes of drumming up interest. That will help the company determine the price of its shares when it goes public, likely in late March or early April. \u201cLyft has clearly demonstrated progress along its pathway to profitability ... but the key question is whether Lyft can accelerate its pathway to profitability,\u201d Kulkarni said. \u201cOn its upcoming roadshow, public equity investors would have a lot of tough questions for Lyft\u2019s management on this topic.\u201d In its risk assessments, Lyft outlined the difficulty of attracting and retaining drivers and riders \u201cin a cost-effective manner,\u201d complying with laws and regulations, and being able to manage growth and expand beyond the U.S. and part of Canada. The company conceded that it has lost money since it started in mid-2012 and its expenses are increasing as it launches new services. \u201cWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future,\u201d the company said. Lyft also said it faces intense competition and could lose market share to competitors. The company acknowledged the importance of developing autonomous vehicle technology on its own or with partners. Uber \u2014 as well as Waymo, General Motors and others \u2014 is working on self-driving vehicles, which they expect to enter the ride-hailing business. If they are able to do that, and Lyft is still relying on drivers, its cost of giving rides likely would be far higher. Despite competing with Lyft, General Motors and Alphabet \u2014 Waymo\u2019s parent company \u2014 each own more than 5 percent of Lyft\u2019s Class A common stock, according to the filing. ___ Krisher reported from Detroit and Liedtke reported from San Francisco. ___ This story has been corrected to read that Lyft\u2019s cash on hand in 2018 was $517 million, not $517,690.","83":"THE KEY A laborer works in an aluminum factory.\u00a0(Chinatopix\u00a0\/AP) A digital attack that spread from the U.S. to Norway is\u00a0a stark reminder\u00a0that even simple digital attacks from low-level hackers can produce major disruptions to people's daily lives and international commerce. The ransomware attack against Norsk Hydro, one of the world\u2019s largest aluminum manufacturers, stopped production at numerous plants and forced others to switch from digital to manual operations. Company employees had to communicate using cellphones and tablets because they couldn\u2019t access their computers, Hydro officials said. Hydro was warning visitors with a printed sign not to connect any cellphones or other devices to its networks: And the hack had broader financial consequences, too: A\u00a0dip\u00a0in the company\u2019s stock\u00a0price\u00a0sparked concerns about the attack's impact on broader aluminum markets.\u00a0 That\u2019s the sort of menace that cyber experts typically worry might be caused by a highly-skilled government-backed hacking group bent on damaging a national adversary \u2014\u00a0but, not this time.\u00a0Most\u00a0public evidence suggests this attack was the work of low-level criminal hackers just trying to make a buck. \u201cSo much of our time is spent talking about nation states, criminal syndicates and highly advanced persistent threats, and that\u2019s not what happened in this instance,\u201d Chris Cummiskey, a former Homeland Security Department cybersecurity official who now leads Cummiskey Strategic Solutions, told me. \u201cIt sounds like just theft and greed to generate revenue.\u201d The Hydro attack serves as a reminder, Cummiskey said, that as manufacturing and related sectors increasingly rely on digital and automated systems, they\u2019ll also be increasingly vulnerable to hacking by a whole range of criminal groups \u2014\u00a0and if those hackers get lucky they can be massively disruptive. \u201cIt does point out that there are these glaring holes, and despite [government and industry\u2019s] best efforts, you just can\u2019t close all of them,\u201d Cummiskey said. It\u2019s also a warning that cyberattacks far outside the traditional sectors that give heartburn to top government officials \u2014\u00a0financial services, energy, telecommunications and health care \u2014\u00a0can be deeply destabilizing, Tod Beardsley, research director at the cybersecurity firm Rapid7, told me. \"[Hydro's] a company that doesn\u2019t leap to mind as a tech company, but the fact that a ransomware attack like this can have a direct effect on real-world commodity prices is surprising and sobering,\" Beardsley said. The company\u2019s stock\u00a0price\u00a0later rebounded Wednesday morning. The attack against Hydro, which employs about 35,000 people in 40 countries, began with a ransomware virus targeting a U.S. plant that locked and encrypted some files Monday night \u2014\u00a0essentially turning their contents to gibberish unless the company agreed to pay a ransom. The infection spread from there to\u00a0numerous other systems, the company\u2019s chief financial officer Eivind Kallevik said during a news conference\u00a0yesterday alongside the Norwegian National Security Authority. \u201cLet me be clear: The situation for hydro .\u2009.\u2009. is quite severe,\u201d Kallevik said. \u201cThe entire worldwide network is down, affecting our production as well as our office operations.\u201d Kallevik declined to say if Hydro will consider paying the ransom. He did say the company has backed up most of its data and that its \u201cbest case\u201d would be to use those backups to restore normal operations once the company\u2019s confident the virus is\u00a0out of its systems.\u00a0The hackers have asked the company to contact them about a ransom, but they have not requested a specific sum of money yet, Kallevik said. Overall, cybersecurity experts gave Hydro high marks for its handling of the ransomware strike on Twitter. Despite the global slowdown, the fact that the company could resume operations manually suggests that the hackers were not able to jump from its office computers to the specialized technology that runs the plants\u2019 machines, Rendition InfoSec\u00a0principal consultant Jake Williams noted. Cybersecurity researcher Kevin Beaumont praised the company's crisis response for quick action and transparency: That transparency likely helped maintain shareholder's confidence in the company, Beaumont suggested.\u00a0 Christopher Krebs, director of DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\u00a0 (Evan Vucci\/AP) PINGED: Homeland Security Department cybersecurity officials plan to\u00a0visit with European allies soon to share what they learned defending the 2018 midterm elections against Russian hackers, CyberScoop\u2019s Sean Lyngaas reported.

Cybersecurity news from the public sector: Cybersecurity news from the private sector:","84":"Two new books are out about President Trump, and both are written by people who 1) were in the room and 2) are broadly sympathetic to Trump but critical of his administration. Trump has reserved most of his ire for former staff member Cliff Sims. But Chris Christie\u2019s faint praise of Trump in recent days might be the most damning. The former New Jersey governor and Trump transition team leader, like Sims, threads the needle of saying nice things about his party\u2019s president and what he has been able to accomplish, while not pretending this has all gone swimmingly. But doing that via a written manuscript is one thing; making it convincing while speaking off the cuff and answering questions is quite another. And at times, Christie\u2019s truly faint praise of Trump has come through. In an interview with \u201cLate Show\u201d host Stephen Colbert on Tuesday night, Christie swilled tequila and said he believed he would have been a better president than Trump. Perhaps that\u2019s a reflection of his own ego more than a judgment of Trump. Fair enough. But although that exchange has gotten the most attention, another one might be more illustrative: COLBERT: Do you regret -- \u00a0 CHRISTIE: No. COLBERT: -- getting Donald Trump -- helping him get elected? CHRISTIE: I made a decision at the time I thought he was going to win the nomination after I dropped out, and that I preferred him to Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s why I made the decision. It wasn\u2019t a whole lot more complicated than that. I still agree with what his policies are more than I agree with Hillary Clinton\u2019s. Listen, he has turned the Republican Party into something different than when I started to run for president. This is not, \u201cHe\u2019s been a great president.\u201d This is, \u201cHe was the better option.\u201d Oh, and also, \u201cHe has changed things\u201d \u2014 without saying those things are particularly great. Fox News Channel\u2019s Laura Ingraham picked up on that and pressed Christie on it Wednesday night, asking whether the changes Trump has wrought are good or bad for the GOP. Christie again could have simply said, \u201cgood,\u201d but he went a different route: CHRISTIE: In some ways good and in some ways bad, from my perspective. In the good ways he\u2019s turned it, I think his toughness on China has been something that the party needed for quite some time, and I think his continued efforts in that regard. His continued efforts and trade in general I think are good and he\u2019s gotten much better deal with Canada and Mexico than we had before. And I think he\u2019ll achieve the same things with the E.U. and Japan. I think he\u2019s been better for us in terms of our regulatory policy and has put more focus than we were putting on one we control Congress and could have done more there too on regulatory issues. \u00a0 Now, in the places where I disagree, I think there are times, in foreign policy where he asked impulsively. You know, whether it\u2019s discussions about Syria and the crosscurrents that involved there. I think he should take a more deliberative approach. I think he is now taking a more deliberative approach. \u00a0 But, listen, in the main, I would say he\u2019s made a party better because he won. He beat Hillary Clinton. Again, it all comes back not to how good Trump is, but how his defeat of Clinton was vital. Ingraham pressed Christie again: INGRAHAM: So, look, I asked you whether the party went into a good or bad direction, and you said the old guard wouldn\u2019t have beaten Hillary. And you are absolutely right. \u00a0... But the party's turn was in the right direction under Trump, and I think you were closer to that than those other guys. CHRISTIE: And that\u2019s what I said. I said in the main I think it was important because the biggest thing he did was win. And those areas in foreign policy where I\u2019ve disagreed with him at times, and I maybe would have a more aggressive, more interventionist policy than he would have, I don\u2019t think that would\u2019ve determined a loss in the election to me when contrasted up against Hillary Clinton with all the other advantages. But in the end, it doesn\u2019t matter. He was the nominee. I was the first person to go out and support him. You were telling me I should do that. And I went out and I did it. This is familiar rhetoric. It\u2019s how Republicans talked about Trump toward the end of the 2016 campaign. But that was when they didn\u2019t quite want to bear-hug him, in large part because they thought he was probably going to lose. When the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape came out, this was the stock answer. It was basically: He\u2019s far from my ideal, but at least he\u2019s not Hillary. What\u2019s notable about Christie\u2019s resurrection of this talking point is that we\u2019re now more than two years into the Trump presidency. There are actual things on which to judge his governance. Instead, Christie felt the need to keep emphasizing that Trump has cleared what Republicans would admit is a pretty low bar of being better than a Clinton. Christie was the first big-name politician to endorse Trump, and he\u2019s still clearly averse to associating his own brand too closely with Trump. It\u2019s not difficult to pick up on some nervousness about how history might ultimately view that endorsement.","85":"Burger King\u2019s newest discount is quite a whopper. No, not that kind of Whopper. The kind that gets customers to walk in and smell the coffee. Burger King rolled out its own coffee subscription service: a cup a day for $5 a month. The chain is betting on the service to get early risers in the door \u2014 and away from other big names in the fast-food breakfast game. The calculus is simple: Sell cheap coffee, sell more breakfast. If subscribers ordered coffee everyday of March, they\u2019d pay roughly 16 cents per piping-hot cup. And while they\u2019re at it, they might just pick up a breakfast sandwich or pancake platter on their way out. \u201cFast food restaurants find ways to get some items that don\u2019t necessarily sell well, and find attention-getting discounts to get people in the door,\u201d said Jonathan Maze, executive editor of Restaurant Business Magazine. \u201cThis is a classic example of that.\u201d Fast food wars are, in part, fought over breakfast. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts hooks customers with its coffee and doughnuts, and Starbucks obviously generates its own share of the morning coffee rush. When McDonald\u2019s rolled out its all-day breakfast menu in 2015, sales sizzled. And it kept the momentum going \u2014 and its stock rising \u2014 by expanding its breakfast offerings over the next few years. In 2018, the company\u2019s chief financial officer said the strategy was meant to \u201cwin back customers at breakfast.\" At the time, the golden arch\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Easterbrook, added: \u201c\u201cIt\u2019s very competitive out there at breakfast.\" (Fast food is gritty competition: In 2018, Burger King offered customers 1-cent Whoppers if they placed an order within 600 feet of a McDonald\u2019s.) The fast-food industry as a whole has struggled with breakfast foot traffic. A February report from the market research firm Mintel said fast-casual restaurants would have to get creative if they wanted to attract customers beyond lunchtime, including through wider breakfast options in the morning or happy hour specials in the evening. The report said that only 6 percent of those surveyed mainly visit fast-casual restaurants for breakfast. That\u2019s compared with 42 percent who said they mainly visited for lunch. Part of that competition, Maze said, comes from the fact that breakfast habits can be hard to break. People get used to a morning routine of, say, picking up coffee from McDonald\u2019s on their way to work. At the same time, any franchise that offers steep discounts could feel a burn. Even if coffee for $5 a month is enough to get customers in the door, franchise operators still run the risk of losing profits on a high-margin menu item, Maze said. \u201cIf you go ten times [in a month], that\u2019s 50 cents a cup,\u201d Maze said, \u201cso you\u2019re taking a lot of profit out for the franchises.\u201d So for Burger King, the question comes down to whether seriously cheap coffee is enough to perk up the breakfast rush and change the perception of at least one Twitter poster: \u201cDo you ever get a coffee from Burger King?\u201d","86":"It appears President Trump is suddenly fond of a new phrase: \u201cPresidential Harassment.\u201d Thursday morning began with tweets on the topic. First, Trump targeted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who announced Wednesday that the committee would investigate alleged financial crimes involving Trump\u2019s businesses. The message accused Schiff of \u201cUnprecedented Presidential Harassment,\u201d which had \u201cnever happened before.\u201d Trump returned to Twitter less than two hours later and repeated the mantra: \u201cPRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT! It should never be allowed to happen again!\u201d Trump\u2019s tone implies wrongdoing, but what he calls \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d is known to most as \u201ccongressional oversight,\u201d an integral part of the United States\u2019 system of checks and balances. Though Trump recently took to the turn of phrase, Thursday was not the first time he used it. \u201cPresidential Harassment\u201d has come up on a handful of occasions, mostly when Trump is searching for someone to blame: According to Trump, in November, it was \u201cthe prospect of Presidential Harassment\u201d by Democrats that caused stock market volatility. In early December, \u201cPresidential Harassment\u201d \u2014 also known as the \u201cphony Russia Witch Hunt\u201d \u2014 caused his plummeting approval rating.    After Republicans lost control of the House during November\u2019s midterm elections, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) cautioned Democrats against \u201cpresidential harassment.\u201d As The Washington Post\u2019s Gabriel Pogrund reported: McConnell warned that \u201cefforts to obtain President Trump\u2019s tax returns and conduct oversight of his administration would backfire politically.\u201d \u201cThe whole issue of presidential harassment is interesting,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe Democrats in the House are going to have to decide just how much presidential harassment they think is good strategy. I\u2019m not so sure it will work for them.\u201d Democrats formally took control of the House on Jan. 3, and vowed to aggressively pursue oversight investigations, which may include issuing subpoenas for potentially damaging documents and advancing the Russia investigation. House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has made clear that she is prepared to defend the nation\u2019s system of checks and balances. The House, she tweeted Tuesday, \u201cwill not surrender its constitutional responsibility to perform oversight.\u201d Legally, \u201charassment\u201d is a term used in civil lawsuits alleging workplace discrimination. Criminal \u201charassment,\u201d which differs from state to state, typically involves behavior intended to alarm, annoy or terrorize another, often causing that person to reasonably fear for his or her safety. Congressional oversight fits neither definition. Trump may not enjoy the oversight process. He may fear the information congressional committees may unearth. But Congress is supposed to bird-dog the executive branch of government. As House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday: \u201cTo say that we can\u2019t do [oversight] is to say that we shouldn\u2019t do our constitutional duty. It\u2019s to assert an executive preeminence that one would think he might want to be a dictator.\u201d Read more: Trump\u2019s tweets could be used against him in court if he declares a national emergency Trump warned Democrats not to investigate him.

For two years I have beaten the drum that mortgage rates are rising and that is going to hurt if you are a buyer \u2014 especially a cash-strapped first-time buyer or a retired buyer on a fixed income. It seems like that day has finally come, and it is having a large impact on our area\u2019s housing market. A booming real estate market in the first half of 2018 marked by record home prices and multiple contracts overshadowed the Federal Reserve\u2019s steadfast changes to monetary policy. But by the second half of 2018, the 30-year mortgage rate had risen to levels we had not seen since before the 2008 housing crash. It probably did not help that by the end of 2018 the stock market had ended lower than where it began at the start of the year, meaning people\u2019s wealth through investments and savings is stagnant at best. Once the flurry of the spring market came to an end, buyers seemingly overnight realized buying a home just got a lot more expensive, and many took a step back in unison around Labor Day. The post-2008 housing market  Since early 2010, the Washington area has enjoyed a bustling, growing and dynamic market. The injection of stimulus into the economy from the federal government, along with fluid, easily accessible credit markets, government-backed loan programs and stock levels tripling in total value (bringing massive wealth to the buying class), has driven the bull market. Most notably the low mortgage rates at the time made it possible for average house hunters to buy in an expensive market (like ours) with little money down and the ability to stomach the monthly payments. The results have been predictable: For eight years, we have been operating in a market that allowed sellers to ask record prices year after year while leaving buyers largely undeterred. To be clear, the past eight years should not be classified as a \u201cnormal market\u201d given that home prices in many neighborhoods have outpaced inflation by a lot. Yet if you are younger than 35, you probably do not know what it is like to try to buy a house with a mortgage rate above 5 percent or the necessity of putting no less than 10 percent down to qualify. The new normal Sometime around last September, it became obvious that houses, which just months before would have sold in the first weekend, were sitting on the market. They were desirable, priced in line with the market and well advertised. I had a few listings in this category. In early fall, the stock market every few weeks would give back one to two months of gains in a day or two, leading to more volatility and concerns. To make matters worse, by Oct. 1 the best interest rate I could get my clients on a 30-year fixed loan was likely to be no less than 5 percent, and that assumed near perfect credit and sizable down payments. So after eight years of 3, 3.5 and 4 percent mortgage rates coupled with down payments of 5 percent or less, borrowers were hit with the reality that buying a $700,000 house with a higher mortgage rate means hundreds of extra dollars in monthly payments and an allocation of a ton more of their savings (in down payment) to make the deal. Right away that took a chunk of the would-be buyers out of the market \u2014 yet inventory levels of homes for sale did not adjust. Moreover, the new tax law in December 2017 took away some incentives \u2014 being able to deduct state and local taxes from federal taxes \u2014 which definitely impacted the market for homes $450,000 and over. The results: Markets flipped from sellers' advantage to buyers' advantage. Almost immediately, for every one buyer there were three really good houses to choose from and no urgency in being outbid. With little warning, buyers became king, yet most sellers refused to adjust. With fewer real buyers in the market, all of a sudden the inventory levels got thrown way out of whack. The bottom line is this: The housing market across the country is contracting. I see it every day in my business, and I speak with dozens of top-performing brokers in other major markets who are saying the same thing. Selling a house for top dollar, much less even selling at all in 2019, will require a ton more strategy and marketing than we have seen in a long time. And buying a place will mean getting well-prepared, navigating a market where many sellers will refuse to adjust their expectations, and finding the deal and lending solution that are right for you. Do not be left without a plan in the new normal market.

Fund manager Norges Bank Investment Management says the fund\u2019s worst-performing investments in 2018 were in the German pharmaceuticals maker Bayer AG, Facebook Inc. and brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev. The fund\u2019s return was a negative 6.1 percent. Chairman and Norwegian Central Bank Governor Oeystein Olsen says the results were \u201cweak\u201d and blamed fragile stock markets in the first and fourth quarters of 2018. Norway first deposited oil and gas profits into the fund in 1996. The fund invests oil and gas proceeds mainly into stocks but also bonds and property worldwide to secure wealth for the Nordic nation\u2019s 5.3 million people.","89":"BEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s civilian aviation authority ordered all Chinese airlines to temporarily ground their Boeing 737 Max 8 planes Monday after one of the aircraft crashed in Ethiopia. The Civil Aviation Administration of China said the order was issued at 9:00 a.m. (0100 GMT) on Monday and would last nine hours. It said the order was \u201ctaken in line with the management principle of zero tolerance for security risks,\u201d because the crash was the second after another of the planes fell into the ocean off the coast of Indonesia in similar circumstances on Oct. 29, killing all aboard. Further notice would be issued after consultation with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing, the administration said. Eight Chinese nationals were among the 157 people aboard the Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines when it went down shortly after takeoff from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa Sunday, leaving no survivors. The crash in Ethiopia could renew safety questions about the newest version of Boeing\u2019s popular 737 airliner since the plane was new and the weather was clear at the time. Finding something wrong, the pilots tried to return to the airport but never made it. In those circumstances, the accident is eerily similar to the October crash in which a 737 Max 8 flown by Indonesia\u2019s Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea minutes after takeoff, killing all 189 people on the plane. But safety experts cautioned against quickly drawing too many parallels between the two crashes. William Waldock, an aviation-safety professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said suspicion will be raised because the same type of plane appeared to crash the same way \u2014 a fatal nosedive that left wreckage in tiny pieces. \u201cInvestigators are not big believers in coincidence,\u201d he said. Waldock said Boeing will look more closely at the flight-management system and automation on the Max. But he noted that it is very early, and more will be known after investigators find and analyze the Ethiopian plane\u2019s black boxes. Alan Diehl, a former National Transportation Safety Board investigator, said the similarities included both crews encountering a problem shortly after takeoff, and reports of large variations in vertical speed during ascent, \u201cclearly suggesting a potential controllability problem\u201d with the Ethiopian jetliner. But there are many possible explanations, Diehl said, including engine problems, pilot error, weight load, sabotage or bird strikes. He said Ethiopian has a good reputation, but investigators will look into the plane\u2019s maintenance, especially since that may have been an issue in the Lion Air investigation. By contrast, the Ethiopian Airlines CEO told reporters that a maintenance check-up did not find any problems with the plane before Sunday\u2019s flight, \u201cso it is hard to see any parallels with the Lion Air crash yet,\u201d said Harro Ranter, founder of the Aviation Safety Network, which compiles information about accidents worldwide. \u201cI do hope though that people will wait for the first results of the investigation instead of jumping to conclusions based on the very little facts that we know so far,\u201d he said. Boeing representatives did not immediately respond for comment. The company tweeted that it was \u201cdeeply saddened to learn of the passing of the passengers and crew\u201d on the Ethiopian Airlines Max airplane. The Chicago-based company said it would send a technical team to the crash site to help Ethiopian and U.S. investigators. A spokesman for the NTSB said the U.S. agency was sending a team of four to assist Ethiopian authorities. Boeing and the U.S. investigative agency are also involved in the Lion Air probe. Indonesian investigators have not stated a cause for the Lion Air crash, but they are examining whether faulty readings from a sensor might have triggered an automatic nose-down command to the plane, which the Lion Air pilots fought unsuccessfully to overcome. The automated system kicks in if sensors indicate that a plane is about to lose lift, or go into an aerodynamic stall. Gaining speed by diving can prevent a stall. The Lion Air plane\u2019s flight data recorder showed problems with an airspeed indicator on four flights, although the airline initially said the problem was fixed. Days after the Oct. 29 accident, Boeing sent a notice to airlines that faulty information from a sensor could cause the plane to automatically point the nose down. The notice reminded pilots of the procedure for handling such a situation, which is to disable the system causing the automatic nose-down movements. Pilots at some airlines, however, including American and Southwest, protested that they were not fully informed about the new system. Boeing Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in December that the Max is a safe plane, and that Boeing did not withhold operating details from airlines and pilots. Diehl, the former NTSB investigator, said the Ethiopian Airlines pilots should have been aware of that issue from press coverage of the Lion Air crash. The 737 is the best-selling airliner in history, and the Max is the newest version of it, with more fuel-efficient engines. The Max is a central part of Boeing\u2019s strategy to compete with European rival Airbus. Boeing has delivered about 350 737 Max planes and has orders for more than 5,000. It is already in use by many airlines including American, United and Southwest. The Lion Air incident does not seem to have harmed Boeing\u2019s ability to sell the Max. Boeing\u2019s stock fell nearly 7 percent on the day of the Lion Air crash. Since then it has soared 26 percent higher, compared with a 4 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index. ___","90":"Stocks plunged Monday as bellwether Caterpillar got a busy earnings week off on a down note, missing profit expectations and adding to worries of a 2019 slowdown. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 200 point points, or 0.8 percent, on the news. Caterpillar is a heavy equipment giant and a big Dow component. Its shares were down almost 10 percent. 3M, Visa and Microsoft were other drags on the Dow. Technology company Nvidia added to the downward market spiral by cutting guidance due, in part, to deterioration in China sales. Nvidia lowered fourth-quarter guidance Monday, saying revenue is expected to be $2.2 billion, down from $2.7 that it had previously estimated. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down 0.8 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was struggling as well, dropping 1.1 percent. Energy companies were down on a drop in oil prices. Caterpillar was also less optimistic for 2019 than analysts had assumed, a sign that it may see the global economy slowing. \u201cCat is a bellwether of global economic activity,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. \u201cIts latest earnings report confirms lots of other indicators showing the global economy is slowing down.\u201d Caterpillar is the world\u2019s largest maker of earth-moving equipment and a harbinger of global economic health. Its products service a wide swath of industries, including road construction, petroleum, mining, logging and agriculture. The Peoria, Ill.-based company, with more than $50 billion in revenue and 95,400 employees, is a major consumer of steel and other materials, which it uses to make tractors, truck engines and loaders. Caterpillar reported earnings of $2.55 per share, well under the $2.99 per share analysts were predicting. Caterpillar said tariffs were raising steel prices and cutting into profits. President Trump\u2019s steel tariffs have raised steel prices for U.S. companies, although the president said in a tweet on Monday that the tariffs have revived America\u2019s steel industry: \u201cTariffs on the \u2018dumping\u2019 of Steel in the United States have totally revived our Steel Industry. New and expanded plants are happening all over the U.S. We have not only saved this important industry, but created many jobs. Also, billions paid to our treasury. A BIG WIN FOR U.S.\u201d The company said it had a record 2018, with full-year sales and revenue at $54.7 billion, up 20 percent from $45.5 billion in 2017. Caterpillar\u2019s guidance for 2019 profit was weaker than expected. It said it expects 2019 profit to increase to a range of $11.75 to $12.75 per share. Analysts had expected $12.73 per share. The company\u2019s revenue beat expectations, earning $14.34 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with $14.33 billion that analysts expected. But Caterpillar\u2019s chief executive was cautious about 2019. \u201cOur outlook assumes a modest sales increase based on the fundamentals of our diverse end markets as well as the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment,\u201d chief executive Jim Umpleby said in a statement accompanying the earnings. Caterpillar\u2019s early report on Monday launches the busiest week of the earnings season, with key players including Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, McDonald\u2019s, Pfizer and others set to report earnings this week. A healthy week could foretell less volatility in the stock market. Disappointing earnings are likely to lead to more volatility similar to that seen in 2018.","91":"Nearly four decades ago, Donald Trump deceived me into including him on the first Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. He claimed a net worth of $100 million but was actually worth less than a tenth of that. Last week, President Trump declared a national state of emergency to bypass the constitutional budgeting powers of Congress and divert money to build a wall on the border with Mexico. What do these acts have in common? Only that they are the first and latest entries on the continuum of cons that have defined Trump\u2019s success. A real estate insider told me back in the 1980s that Trump\u2019s win-at-all-costs father, Fred, \u201cloves a crook and he loves a showman.\u201d Donald Trump has built his extraordinary career by exhibiting the characteristics of both. He is a self-promoter willing to lie, swindle and destroy to advance his insatiable self-interest. I am not the first journalist to observe that for Trump, the \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d has been the art of the con. But as the first journalist to enable the consummate con man\u2019s career-boosting deceptions, I have a completist\u2019s view of the pernicious racket that is his playbook. Here, in roughly chronological order, are the six essential cons around which Trump has built and sustained his success: Con No. 1: To borrow billions, Trump lies to inflate his net worth. As Trump\u2019s power has grown, his lies have become bolder and more apparent. Early in his career, however, when Trump first conned me into putting him on the Forbes 400 list and then deceived financial institutions to loan him billions of dollars based upon a vastly exaggerated net worth, his deceptions were more elaborate and difficult to track. As recounted in The Washington Post last year, Trump fed me carefully crafted false information for years. This included two long phone interviews in which Trump pretended to be a nonexistent assistant named John Barron, as well as his having his notorious fixer Roy Cohn call me at Forbes in 1982 and 1983 to lie on his behalf. Trump was consistent in maintaining the lies he told Forbes: that he controlled his father\u2019s assets, that his family owned 25,000 apartments (they owned less than half that number), and that his projects had less debt and far more profits than they actually did \u2014 all facts and figures that were hard to challenge. Anyone who listens to the two 40-minute telephone recordings I made in 1984 of the man who Trump\u2019s secretary said was the Trump Organization\u2019s \u201cVP of Finance John Barron\u201d can easily recognize Trump\u2019s thinly disguised voice. Some critics wondered how stupid I had been not to have seen through this ruse. Yet even the most seasoned journalist could not have imagined a prominent figure doing what nobody had, as far as I am aware, dared to do before or since: impersonate a nonexistent spokesman on the phone to national media. The failure of our imagination to respond to Trump remains true to this day. It is not that we underestimate his capacity as a businessman, candidate or president of the United States. It is that we cannot imagine \u2014 and are unprepared to respond to \u2014 anyone who lies and cons as shamelessly and effectively as he does. Trevor Noah of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d framed Trump\u2019s Forbes 400 scam as his \u201corigin lie,\u201d the foundation he built his entire career on. That\u2019s because, as Tim O\u2019Brien wrote in his book \u201cTrumpNation\u201d: \u201cThe more often Forbes mentioned him, the more credible Donald\u2019s claim to vast wealth became. \u2026 The more credible his claim to vast wealth became, the easier it was for him to get on the Forbes 400 \u2014 which became the standard that other media, and apparently some of the country\u2019s biggest banks, used when judging Donald\u2019s riches.\u201d It is hard to imagine that financial institutions would extend $3 billion in loans to Trump\u2019s Atlantic City and New York real estate projects based on his inflated asset statements and Forbes 400 listing without insisting on audited financial statements that demonstrated exactly how much cumulative debt he was on the hook for. Yet during the eight years after he first conned his way onto the list, this appears to be exactly what happened. As with all great con men, Trump is as skilled in the art of deception as he is in the art of promotion. He made certain that nobody could definitively counter his inflated-wealth con by ensuring that a comprehensive balance sheet was never created. As The Post\u2019s Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher wrote in their book \u201cTrump Revealed,\u201d Trump, in 1990, brought in Steve Bollenbach as chief financial officer to respond to lender concerns about his crippling debt. They report: \u201cWhen Bollenbach began delving into the organization\u2019s finances, he got a surprise. The small staff on the twenty-sixth floor of Trump Tower included three accountants. Each knew about pieces of the fraying empire \u2014 the casinos, for instance, or the condos. But no one knew the overall picture; there were no consolidated financial reports.\u201d This was deliberate. And despite multiple bankruptcies, Trump\u2019s inflated-worth ruse remained at the center of his image as a successful businessman, a billionaire able to play the part of a brilliant tycoon on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d reality show and capable of licensing his name for millions of dollars. Although Trump has threatened to sue reporters many times, the only time he followed through with a libel suit was in 2006, after O\u2019Brien, in \u201cTrumpNation,\u201d reported that three experts close to Trump believed his true net worth to be between $150 million and $250 million \u2014 far from the $6 billion he claimed he was worth at the time. Trump lost the suit, appealed the ruling, then lost the appeal in 2011. This was the same year he again demonstrated how important his illusory billionaire status was to him. As noted in \u201cTrump Revealed,\u201d while cooperating with a Comedy Central \u201croast\u201d of him, Trump insisted that the show\u2019s comedians agree to keep only one subject off-limits. \u201cDon\u2019t say I have less money than I say I do,\u201d Trump insisted, according to comedian Anthony Jeselnik. \u201cMake fun of my kids, do whatever you want. Just don\u2019t say that I don\u2019t have that much money.\u201d Con No. 2: To avoid taxes, Trump lies to deflate his net worth. The only people Trump ever wanted to convince that he had less money than he did were those who worked for the Internal Revenue Service. And somehow, despite his inflated public claims of income and valuations, he managed to do just that. Last year, the New York Times published the results of a painstakingly researched investigation into Trump\u2019s tax dodges. The article stated: \u201cPresident Trump participated in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud, that greatly increased the fortune he received from his parents \u2026 He and his siblings set up a sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents \u2026 He also helped formulate a strategy to undervalue his parents\u2019 real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns, sharply reducing the tax bill when those properties were transferred to him and his siblings. \u2026 The president\u2019s parents, Fred and Mary Trump, transferred well over $1 billion in wealth to their children, which could have produced a tax bill of at least $550 million under the 55 percent tax rate then imposed on gifts and inheritances.\u201d Instead, the Times reported, \u201cthe Trumps paid a total of $52.2 million, or about 5 percent.\u201d Virtually every aspect of the Trump family empire operated like a tax evasion scheme. According to the Times, over the years, 295 separate revenue streams were created for Fred Trump to evade gift and income taxes while directing money to his children. Donald Trump not only managed to deflate the value of his family\u2019s assets for tax purposes, but in a con that probably goes unrivaled in American tax-dodging history, from at least 1996 onward, he reportedly erased personal income taxes he would have otherwise paid from profitable ventures like his \u201cApprentice\u201d TV show. How? He used the whopping $916 million loss of the money that had come from the lenders who had backed his casinos. Over the next 15 years, Trump was able to pay no income taxes on this loss of $916 million in other people\u2019s money. But Trump has not been content with schemes to avoid federal government and state tax collectors. The undervaluation con continues full throttle as he evades local real estate taxes on his golf courses. As The Post pointed out in an investigation in 2016, Trump\u2019s attorneys audaciously deflate the value of his many golf courses to minimize local taxes. In his financial disclosures for the Trump National Golf Course Westchester, The Post reported, \u201cTrump valued the course at more than $50 million. But last year, his attorneys filed papers with the state declaring the \u2018full market value\u2019 of the course was far lower: about $1.4 million.\u201d Trump has also been the king of tax-break litigation, suing the city of New York time and time again to take advantage of tax abatements that were never meant to apply to the type of luxury developments he built. Veteran New York Times real estate reporter Charles Bagli added up the staggering value of these tax dodges in a Times investigation titled, \u201cA Trump Empire Built on Inside Connections and $885 Million in Tax Breaks.\u201d During a 2016 presidential debate, when challenged by Hillary Clinton to explain why he refused to disclose his taxes and why he paid no taxes on hundreds of millions in income, Trump replied, \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d Con No. 3: To be a winner, Trump makes losers of those he does business with. To make every business deal with him sound sweeter than it was, Trump marketed his name as synonymous with gold-plated luxury. But few of his deals had happy endings. His narcissistic need to be a winner every time meant that there were losers every time. This included just about anyone who made the mistake of signing a contract to lend or partner or supply goods or services to him. After stiffing his partners and lenders in Atlantic City in 1991 by declaring bankruptcy and forcing them to write down billions of dollars in losses, Trump soon retook control of the properties by creating a public casino company in 1995 and selling the stock to suckers attracted to his name. According to a MarketWatch columnist, \u201cDonald Trump was a stock market disaster,\u201d with Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts racking up more than $1 billion in losses during his 13 years as chairman, while its stock fell from a high of $35 to just 17 cents. But despite making losers of the poor saps who invested with him, Trump emerged a winner, soaking the bankrupted public company for what Fortune magazine estimated was $82 million in compensation. Trump has bragged: \u201cDoes anyone know more about litigation than Trump? I\u2019m like a PhD in litigation.\u201d Unlike all the other things Trump says he knows more about than anybody, this one has a morsel of truth to it. While most Americans expect to do what they promise in a signed contract, Trump sees contracts as mere jumping-off points for \u201cnegotiation.\u201d Knowing that litigation is costly and can drag on for years, Trump\u2019s business modus operandi for stiffed contractors has been, \u201cYou can negotiate with my lawyers for a settlement or sue me and see how long that takes!\u201d An analysis by USA Today published in June 2016 found that during the previous 30 years, Trump and his businesses have been involved in 3,500 state and federal legal cases. Understanding special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation and Trump\u2019s long relationship with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia begins with recognizing that Trump has among the worst reputations of any businessperson in America. As investigative journalist Craig Unger explained in \u201cHouse of Trump, House of Putin,\u201d after burning so many major financial institutions by losing more than $3 billion in Atlantic City and overpriced New York properties, Putin\u2019s \u201coligarchs and Mafia kingpins\u201d were some of the only investors willing to do business with Trump, through untraceable offshore entities. Unger wrote that Trump\u2019s real estate was \u201cused as a vehicle that likely served to launder enormous amounts of money \u2014 perhaps billions of dollars \u2014 for the Russian Mafia for more than three decades.\u201d It is no coincidence that the only major financial institution willing to provide Trump with significant funding after his bankruptcies has been Deutsche Bank, which itself has been the source of fines and investigations related to billions of dollars in transactions by money-laundering clients, including Russian oligarchs. Russian oligarchs were not the only money launderers to fund Trump\u2019s properties. Global Witness, a nonprofit watchdog organization, headlined a scathing expos\u00e9 a few years ago: \u201cNarco-a-Lago: Money laundering at the Trump Ocean Club in Panama.\u201d The report found that many of the presold apartments in the 70-floor Panama City tower were funded by money launderers, including Colombian cocaine cartel members. Reuters reported that, \u201cBy the time the Trump Ocean Club project was complete in 2011, many investors had withdrawn and lost their deposits rather than stump up the 70 percent balance. Bondholders lost, too \u2026 There was one person who still profited: Donald Trump. Court records \u2026 indicate Trump \u2026 earned between $30 million and $50 million from lending his name to the project.\u201d Con No. 4: To win in politics, Trump makes voters believe that his presidency benefits them. One of the great mysteries of Trump\u2019s ascension to power is his support among working-class Americans. He is far from being a person who mingles with the masses. Trump\u2019s social and professional activities have been limited to those who are superwealthy, famous or influential. To the extent that he has interacted with common Americans, it has been as a commercial icon: He sells them chances to lose money at his casinos\u2019 slot machines; he grants them admission to real estate society through the scam that was Trump University; he offers them armchair viewing of crass demonstrations of cruel power in \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d As part of candidate Trump\u2019s campaign to attract working-class Americans to vote against their economic self-interest, Trump bragged that he was \u201cvery highly educated \u2026 I have the best words,\u201d while continually railing against those he calls \u201cthe three most dangerous voices in America: academic elites, political elites and media elites.\u201d He is easily the most successful anti-government populist to have been born with a silver spoon in his mouth. It is no coincidence that at the same time, he is a prolific liar. Accepting Trump\u2019s endless deceits have become articles of faith to any number of the 64 million Americans who, in 2016, were led to believe that his election would benefit them and their families. That Trump frequently lies about something he himself has been recorded saying in the recent past makes no difference to his base. Although the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d prosperity he promises is available only for those who are part of the club of ultrawealthy elites on whose behalf he legislates, Trump supporters willfully listen only to their leader\u2019s words instead of his actions in office. As Trump\u2019s supporters march toward an illusory future with their hate-mongering leader, they remain oblivious to the trillions of dollars that Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the top 1 percent and their corporations will add to the federal debt, or to the forecasts of diminished spending on programs that help most working and middle-class Americans. Trump told a Missouri audience in November 2017 that his tax bill was created to help the middle class and that it \u201cis going to cost me a fortune, this thing, believe me.\u201d In reality, most of the long-term tax savings will go to major corporations and the superwealthy. According to a Forbes estimate, Trump could personally save $11 million annually. Yet his base of working- and middle-class supporters remains blind to the fact that Trump is making America great for himself and not them. That Trump\u2019s lies are believed by so many is a testament to his manipulative mastery of the art of the con. In supporting his wall on the border with Mexico, Trump says that more than 3,000 terrorists were apprehended at the southern border. Yet our government\u2019s own statistics show that the number was zero. Zero! Trump promised that Mexicans would pay for the wall again and again, then denied that he had ever said it and shut down the federal government because Congress refused to pay for it. Trump has even scammed his followers out of core Judeo-Christian values such as compassion. Thousands of children will suffer lifelong trauma because they are being separated from their parents as a result of Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d border policy. When I asked a white, 82-year-old Trump-supporting Floridian grandmother how she supported this policy given her Christian faith, her face seethed with anger: \u201cIt\u2019s their parents\u2019 fault for bringing them!\u201d Scapegoating foreigners for political gain is as old and tragically effective a tactic as appealing to racism. It is the same hatemongering tune that stirs disempowered working-class white people to blame African Americans for their economic challenges. As President Lyndon Johnson said to his young aide Bill Moyers in 1960: \u201cIf you can convince the lowest white man he\u2019s better than the best colored man, he won\u2019t notice you\u2019re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he\u2019ll empty his pockets for you.\u201d Con No. 5: To avoid accountability, Trump makes the media, and truth, the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d  Truth is the greatest threat to Donald Trump. He despises the transparency and accountability that flows from a free press. He continually attacks the media as \u201cthe enemy of the people,\u201d despite increasing violence against journalists by some of his supporters, repeating the phrase in a Wednesday tweet in reference to the Times. Gabriel Sherman, national affairs editor at New York magazine, described Trump\u2019s use of this term as \u201cfull-on dictator speak.\u201d For opponents of Joseph Stalin, being branded an enemy of the people was a death sentence. In Nazi Germany, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels also favored the term, arguing in 1941 that \u201ceach Jew is a sworn enemy of the German people.\u201d In an interview on Sept. 6, 2018, Trump responded to a critical Times editorial by stating, \u201cThe Times should never have done that, because really what they\u2019ve done is, virtually, you know it\u2019s treason.\u201d Trump regularly insults or threatens to sue journalists who refuse to act as stenographers for his lies. \u201cIt\u2019s frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write. And people should look into it,\u201d he said, referring to NBC News on Oct. 11, 2017. \u201cNetwork news,\u201d he tweeted that day, \u201chas become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked.\u201d This prompted Sen. John McCain to note that the comment was \u201chow dictators get started.\u201d Repeat a lie often enough, the saying goes, and it takes root as the truth. The Post has documented (and updates each day) every \u201cfalse or merely misleading\u201d claim that Trump has made since his election, and found that the president has lied more than 8,700 times. The rate of reckless falsehoods uttered per day has accelerated with his time in office \u2014 and with the convictions of his associates stemming from the Mueller investigation. With the help of Fox News, Trump\u2019s relentless deceptions have been successful in attracting and maintaining his core supporters. Trump boasted about the power of the deception of his Fox News-misinformed supporter base when he said, on the campaign trail, \u201cI love the poorly educated,\u201d and also, famously, \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn\u2019t lose voters.\u201d In his cautionary short handbook, \u201cOn Tyranny: Twenty Lessons From the Twentieth Century,\u201d Yale history professor Timothy Snyder identifies core components of fascism that are echoed in Trump\u2019s ability to win and sustain the support of his political base. Snyder reflects on the extraordinary diaries of Victor Klemperer, a professor who survived Hitler and lived to write the tale. \u201cOnce truth had become oracular rather than factual, evidence was irrelevant,\u201d Snyder wrote. \u201cAt the end of the war, a worker told Klemperer that \u2018understanding is useless, you have to have faith. I believe in the Fuhrer.\u2019 \u201d Post columnist Greg Sargent believes that Trump\u2019s war on the truth is worse than simple self-aggrandizement. \u201cWhen Trump insists on his own invented \u2018facts,\u2019 \u201d Sargent wrote, \u201che makes reality-based political dialogue impossible. His utter disregard for truth is a subversion of our democracy and a dereliction of his duty as president.\u201d \u201cFascists,\u201d Snyder writes, \u201cdespised the small truths of daily existence, loved slogans that resonated like a new religion, and preferred creative myths to history or journalism. They used new media, which at the time was radio, to create a drumbeat of propaganda that aroused feelings before people had time to ascertain facts. And now, as then, many people confused faith in a hugely flawed leader with the truth about the world we all share. \u2026 Post-truth is pre-fascism.\u201d Con No. 6: To stoke fear, Trump recasts perpetrators as victims. As president, Trump\u2019s primary governance strategy relies on the same deceptive manipulation of human fear that brought him victory as a candidate. He has proved himself masterful at playing the white Christian male grievance card. Whether it is the foreigners streaming across the border to take American jobs, the dark-skinned urbanites coming for rural Americans\u2019 guns or empowered women upending patriarchal traditions, Trump and his Fox News echo chamber let white Christians know that they are being victimized and that far worse will follow if they do not fight for their right to oppress others. A few months before the 2016 election, Molly Ball published an extraordinary article in the Atlantic predicting how Trump could use fear to win. \u201cRatcheting up fear,\u201d Ball wrote, \u201chelps Trump. \u2026 The fear reaction is a universal one to which everyone is susceptible \u2026 fear makes them cower from the unfamiliar and seek refuge and comfort. Trump channels people\u2019s anger, but he salves their fear with promises of protection, toughness, strength. It is a feedback loop: He stirs up people\u2019s latent fears, then offers himself as the only solution.\u201d Ball quoted a top Republican admaker who explained: \u201cFear is the simplest emotion to tweak in a campaign ad. You associate your opponent with terror, with fear, with crime, with causing pain and uncertainty.\u201d Trump\u2019s argument for building the wall with Mexico, even at the cost of the largest-ever abuse of the doctrine of eminent domain to seize private property, has no basis in rational analysis. All it has going for it is the con man\u2019s relentless playing of the fear card. \u201cThe Democrats,\u201d Trump warned last October, \u201cwill open our borders to deadly drugs and ruthless gangs. The Democrats \u2014 and I say this \u2014 and I've dealt with it \u2014 the Democrats are the party of crime.\u201d Nazi leader Hermann G\u00f6ring once said: \u201cThe people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.\u201d Blaming the victim also works for sexual assault. At least 22 women have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Trump has denied every accusation, proclaiming that these \u201cfalse allegations\u201d were made by \u201cwomen who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me.\u201d At a 2016 campaign rally, he told his supporters who the real victim was. \u201cEvery woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTotal fabrication. The events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.\u201d When it came time to rescue his controversial choice of Brett M. Kavanaugh as Supreme Court justice, Trump repeated the perpetrator-as-victim strategy that had worked so well for him. Bill Shine, Trump\u2019s recently hired deputy chief of staff for communications, was just the right man for the job. Until being forced out of Fox News in 2017, Shine was the right-hand man of Fox CEO and alleged sexual predator Roger Ailes. There, as Vox observed, Shine was \u201ca man with 20 years of experience enabling and covering up rampant sexual harassment, assault, and abuse.\u201d After coaching sessions orchestrated by the White House, Kavanaugh appeared in an exclusive interview on Fox News arguing what the writer Jacob Weindling of Paste termed \u201cthe Bill O\u2019Reilly defense,\u201d the \u201cstandard Fox News sexual harassment playbook of denying everything while painting yourself as the victim.\u201d By the time Kavanaugh faced Christine Blasey Ford, who had accused him of sexual assault while they were in high school, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was arguing that her testimony was part of a \u201cshameless smear campaign\u201d by Democrats to destroy an innocent man\u2019s life. White Christian men are not the only victims in Trump\u2019s imaginary world. America itself is being victimized \u2014 though not by the usual suspects. For more than 60 years, Republican Party voters and their leaders have been the most outspoken enemies of totalitarian Russia, denouncing nuclear disarmament while fanning the fires of murderous foreign wars to stop the expansion of Soviet influence. Now, quite suddenly, Trump has recast Putin, the most ruthless dictator to control Russia since the dark days of Stalin, into America\u2019s friend, while denouncing NATO allies as freeloaders and America\u2019s CIA and FBI as \u201cdeep state\u201d enemies of the American people. Given Russia\u2019s role in propping up his candidacy and real estate empire, it is easy to understand why Trump has done everything in his power to support Putin\u2019s efforts to weaken the NATO alliance. What is tougher to understand are the self-identified conservatives and patriots who suddenly reversed a lifetime of political beliefs to suit the worldview of their corrupt leader. In George Orwell\u2019s dystopian classic \u201c1984,\u201d the empire of Oceania is in an endless war with Eurasia. Then, without notice, in the middle of \u201cHate Week,\u201d the all-powerful Party decides to join with its longtime enemy and be at war with Eastasia, its longtime ally. Once Big Brother makes known its decision, it becomes treason to disagree \u2014 or even to recall the past. Trump\u2019s seemingly limitless power over his core supporters allows him to justify even the most reprehensible behavior and manipulate their fear as he transforms friends into enemies and compassion into hatred. This power is as ominous as Big Brother\u2019s. Fear of a fascist future is what led me to write my new dystopian novel, \u201cAmerica 2034: Utopia Rising,\u201d a spinoff of \u201c1984\u201d set in Trump\u2019s nightmarish fifth term as President for Life. The story opens by describing how Trump declares his second state of emergency the day before the 2020 election, ordering a communications blackout to take control of polling places nationwide. This cautionary tale reflects what I fear may be Trump\u2019s seventh, and most far-reaching, scam: conning Americans out of our democracy.","92":"KISSIMMEE, Fla. \u2014 When they started spring training, the Atlanta Braves had one opening in their pitching rotation. With a week to go before opening day, they may have three. The Braves are holding out some hope that Kevin Gausman will work through his shoulder soreness in time to pitch a game in the first turn through their rotation. However, that appears unlikely. Gausman, who has pitched only two innings in games this spring, threw a 58-pitch bullpen session on Tuesday. \u201cYou\u2019d like to get him up to 90 before you\u2019d pitch him in a major league game,\u201d said manager Brian Snitker. Mike Foltynewicz, who last pitched Feb. 24 before elbow soreness set in, is throwing again but will need a month buildup before starting a regular-season game. That leaves Julio Teheran and Sean Newcomb as the only named members of the rotation, with Teheran expected to start the Braves\u2019 opener at Philadelphia on March 28. Snitker doesn\u2019t expect to announce any additions in the next few days. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a week left to see where we are. We aren\u2019t forced to make any decisions yet,\u201d Snitker said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens (with Gausman\u2019s) next time out and go from there.\u201d Even if Gausman is ready to pitch in the first days of April, that leaves four young and inexperienced arms competing for two spots \u2014 Touki Toussaint, Kyle Wright, left-hander Max Fried and 21-year-old Bryce Wilson, who is considered a long shot with no major league experience. Mike Soroka, another 21-year-old pitcher, is also throwing pain-free for the first time in weeks. But he hasn\u2019t pitched in a game. Soroka, who was shut down late last summer with the same kind of shoulder soreness he experienced this spring, was optioned to the minor league camp on Wednesday. Relievers A.J. Minter (shoulder) and Darren O\u2019Day (forearm tightness) are expected to start the season on the injured list, opening spots in the bullpen. The Braves had hoped to stock most of their promising young starters in the minor leagues in April and bring them up during the season. But the injuries have sped up the timetable and at least two of the pitchers are likely to start the season in the rotation. The 25-year-old Fried is the latest to state his case, with five shutout innings and seven strikeouts Tuesday against the Washington Nationals. \u201cWe have a lot of guys throwing really well, so it gives you that little extra \u2018I-want-to-top-the-other-guy,\u2019 but I think that\u2019s really healthy,\u201d said Fried, who has nine major league starts. \u201cYou\u2019re not only competing against the other team but you\u2019re competing against yourselves. It only pushes you that much farther.\u201d Snitker said Fried, Wright, Toussaint and Wilson will be ready to follow Teheran after the opener. \u201cWe\u2019ve got everybody lined up. Everybody\u2019s in good shape and we don\u2019t feel pressure to have to do anything (outside the roster),\u201d Snitker said. \u201cPretty much all of them have had really nice camps, too. Coming off the experiences they had last year, they seem to be continuing to build on that.\u201d ___","93":"JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 In a blow for Boeing, Indonesia\u2019s flag carrier is seeking the cancellation of a multibillion dollar order for 49 of the manufacturer\u2019s 737 Max 8 jets, citing a loss of confidence after two crashes within five months. It is the first announcement of a cancellation since Boeing\u2019s new model aircraft were grounded following fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. PT Garuda Indonesia, which had ordered 50 Max 8 jets in 2014 and had received just one plane last year, sent a letter to Boeing last week requesting to cancel the order worth $4.9 billion, company spokesman Ikhsan Rosan said Friday. The carrier has so far paid Boeing about $26 million for the order. Garuda joined other airlines worldwide in grounding its one Max 8 jet after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight this month which killed all 157 people aboard. It came less than five months after 189 people died in the Oct. 29 crash of another Max 8, operated by Indonesian private carrier Lion Air. \u201cPassengers always ask what type of plane they will fly as they have lost trust and confidence in the Max 8 jet,\u201d Rosan told The Associated Press. \u201cThis would harm our business.\u201d He said that Garuda plans to meet with Boeing representatives next week in Jakarta to discuss details of canceling the order. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to use Max jets ... but maybe will consider switching it with another Boeing model of plane,\u201d Rosan said. He said Indonesian passengers are afraid to take flights using any Max model, whether it\u2019s the 8, 9 or 10 series. A preliminary report from Indonesia\u2019s National Transportation Safety Committee in December stopped short of declaring a probable cause of the Oct. 29 crash. Officials have provided scant details since then, saying they are still analyzing data from a cockpit voice recorder that was only recovered from the sea in January. Meanwhile, in Europe, Polish national carrier PLL LOT said it was considering asking for financial compensation from Boeing or even a delay to deliveries of purchased 737 Max 8 aircraft after the planes were grounded globally following the crash in Ethiopia. In a statement to the AP on Friday, LOT said it would wait for communications from Boeing and flight regulators on whether to put the Max 8 planes back into service. LOT has five 737 Max 8 planes and is to receive nine more this year. Its total fleet counts over 80 aircraft. Another Polish carrier, charter airline EnterAir, said Friday it would also seek damages. It has two Max 8 planes and has placed orders for another four. Earlier this month, Norwegian Air Shuttles said it would seek compensation from Boeing. It had grounded its 18 Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft. With Boeing\u2019s backlog of 4,600 unfilled orders for Max jets, the loss of the Garuda order figures to have little financial impact on the Chicago-based company. The danger is that other airlines could follow, particularly if investigators fault the plane for the accidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia. \u201cWe think other cancellations may follow as global customers remain spooked after two crashes with seemingly similar causes,\u201d Jim Corridore, an airline analyst with CFRA Research, said in a note to clients. Corridore said, however, that if Boeing delivers a software patch to a flight-control system suspected in the crashes, and the planes are allowed to resume flying, \u201cmost customers will be reassured.\u201d He said investors will eventually focus on strong demand for airliners. The Wall Street Journal reported late Friday that federal investigators are looking into whether Boeing gave U.S. regulators and the company\u2019s customers incomplete or misleading information about the jets. The report cited people familiar with the matter who were not named. Earlier this week, a person briefed on the matter told The Associated Press that U.S. prosecutors are looking into the development of the 737 Max jets. The Transportation Department\u2019s inspector general is also investigating the FAA\u2019s approval of jets, a U.S. official told AP. Boeing Co. shares closed Friday down $10.53, or 2.8 percent, at $362.17 amid a broad stock market decline. Boeing shares have dropped 14 percent since the Ethiopia Airlines crash. ___ AP Airline Writer David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this report.","94":"INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Receiver D.K. Metcalf showed off his muscle-man physique \u2014 and his speed \u2014 in Indianapolis. Defensive end Montez Sweat proved big men can run fast, too. The two pro prospects from rival colleges in Mississippi left the NFL\u2019s annual scouting combine as the two biggest winners of the weeklong event. They were impressive. Following Metcalf\u2019s performance in the 40-yard dash, the New York Jets\u2019 official Twitter account posted: \u201c4.33? At that size?\u201d The comment could tip off the Jets\u2019 plans for the No. 3 pick in April\u2019s NFL draft, considering quarterback Sam Darnold will be entering his second season in the league this fall. And who could blame them for taking Metcalf, who possesses rare athleticism for a receiver that measures in at 6-foot-3 3\/8, 238 pounds and has 1.6 percent body fat. His performance was even better. After wowing scouts by doing 27 reps on the bench press at 225 pounds, he posted a vertical jump of 40 1\/2 inches, a broad jump of 11 feet, 2 inches, and the 40-yard dash time \u2014 all top-five performances among the receivers. What made it even more impressive for the son of former NFL offensive lineman Terrence Metcalf was that he did all of it after having season-ending neck surgery last fall. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be here right now,\u201d the former Ole Miss star told NFL Network following his workout. Meanwhile, Sweat, the former Mississippi State defensive lineman, made his workout look like it was, well, no sweat. The 6-foot-6, 260-pound Sweat was clocked at 4.41 seconds in the 40, the top speed by a defensive lineman since at least 2003 and faster times than those posted at the combine by Amari Cooper, Julio Jones or Odell Beckham Jr. Sweat also finished fourth among edge players in the broad jump (11 feet, 2inches) and three-cone drill (7 seconds flat) and was sixth in the vertical jump (36 inches). The only question might be his strength. He did 21 reps on the bench press, 12th at his position. But the NFL\u2019s official Twitter account was impressed with what it saw. \u201cSomething special out of Starkville,\u201d Sunday\u2019s post read. Now team officials will spend the next six-plus weeks picking apart game film and combine performances, attending pro day, doing additional background and medical checks while bringing in players for formal interviews before making draft-weekend decisions. LOOKING GOOD The offensive and defensive linemen are supposed to be the strength of this draft. The combine proved it. Defensive end Nick Bosa and defensive tackle Quinnen Williams of Alabama put themselves in the conversation to be the top overall pick with strong showings. Bosa completed the 40 in 4.79 seconds and did 29 reps on the bench press. Williams, at 303 pounds, ran the 40 in 4.83 seconds. Michigan\u2019s dynamic duo of defensive end Rashan Gary and linebacker Devin Bush also helped themselves with strong showings Sunday. Gary ran a 4.58 in the 40 \u2014 No. 1 among defensive linemen \u2014 while Bush posted a 4.43. Center Garrett Bradbury of North Carolina State and offensive tackle Andre Dillard of Washington State had the best performances Friday, the first full day of workouts in Indy. Both helped themselves with good performances in the 40 and demonstrated their agility with solid times in the three-cone drill and 20-yard shuttle. Bradbury also had 34 reps on the bench press, second among offensive linemen. Safety Zedrick Woods of Mississippi posted a 4.29-second 40 on Monday, fastest time all week. Cornerback Jamel Dean of Auburn ran a 4.30-second 40 on Monday, the second-fastest time of the week. THE LOSERS At least four players couldn\u2019t finish their workouts because of injuries, including potential first-round pick Jachai Polite from Florida. The outside linebacker came to Indy with high expectations but ran the 40-yard dash in 4.84 seconds, slower than inside linebacker Manti Te\u2019o in 2013, whose 4.82-second run helped him slide into the second round. Polite stopped after hurting his hamstring and will have to try and rebuild his stock before the draft. Highly rated defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence of Clemson didn\u2019t finish because of a minor thigh injury in his left leg, and his college teammate, linebacker Tre Lamar, hurt his right shoulder on the bench press. Top cornerback Greedy Williams of LSU did not compete after suffering cramps Monday. But the most serious injury may have come Sunday when Ohio State cornerback Kendall Sheffield suffered a torn pectoral muscle, NFL Network reported. Sheffield did not work out Monday. And scouts may be hard-pressed to find breakaway runners in this draft class. Though Josh Jacobs of Alabama did not run Friday, the fastest back in the group was Justice Hill of Oklahoma at 4.40. Ryquell Armstead of Temple was second at 4.45. CAUTIOUS TIGER Questions about Lawrence\u2019s suspension for using a banned substance, which kept him out of the College Football Playoff, continued in Indianapolis. And Lawrence acknowledges the surprise results of his previous test have made him wary. \u201cEvery time I take a drug test it\u2019s going to be skeptical because that was just something that I know I didn\u2019t do and something to pop up like that just really unfortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time I pee in a cup now I\u2019m just thinking, \u2018OK, let me pray because it\u2019s just something stupid like that can happen.\u2019 \u201d ___","95":"As a top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, Dorothy Robyn was charged with advancing America\u2019s aerospace industry. Part of the job was not choosing sides between companies. But there was one exception: Boeing. \u201cIt was the one company for which I could be an out-and-out advocate,\u201d Robyn said Thursday. In competitions between American companies, the administration as a rule remained neutral. But Boeing\u2019s commercial airplane division employed tens of thousands of Americans and its prime competition, Airbus, was in Europe. \u201cIn the engines business, you can\u2019t choose between GE and Pratt & Whitney. With Boeing, that\u2019s it. They\u2019re ours. It is the only sector where we have a de facto national champion and you can be an out-and-out advocate for it.\u201d For Boeing\u2019s 102-year history, dating to the start of the First World War, the company and the country have relied upon one another, together creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, outfitting the United States with top military aircraft and supplying planes worldwide to allow the growth of passenger air travel and to boost U.S. exports. Now, however, with Boeing and U.S. regulators facing criticism for appearing slow to react to the crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8 jet in Ethiopia, Boeing\u2019s intermingled interests with the U.S. government are coming under new scrutiny. There is much to examine. For decades, U.S. presidents have advocated for the company\u2019s interests and for the past 30 years they have done so while flying primarily on the two Boeing VC-25As that serve as Air Force One when the president is on them. President Barack Obama hired members of the Boeing board to serve as his chief of staff and commerce secretary. Against Republican opposition, he fiercely defended the federal Export-Import Bank, which has subsidized so many airline sales to foreign airline carriers by offering loan guarantees that conservative critics have derided it as \u201cBoeing\u2019s Bank.\u201d \u201cI have to say that, given the number of planes that I\u2019ve been selling around the world, I expect a gold watch upon my retirement,\u201d Obama said at a Boeing plant in 2012. President Trump seemed to get off to a bumpy start with the company, criticizing Boeing\u2019s Air Force One contract before entering office. But Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg, while praising Trump\u2019s \u201cbusiness headset,\u201d pledged to keep costs down and won favor with the president. Trump later made the unusual move of allowing Muilenburg to sit in on a phone call to an Air Force general managing the Pentagon\u2019s largest weapons program. In December, Trump tapped a former Boeing executive, Patrick M. Shanahan, as acting defense secretary after the resignation of Jim Mattis. And Trump\u2019s policies, including pushing for a big increase in U.S. exports and boost in military spending, have been beneficial for Boeing, which has seen its stock price nearly triple since he took office, before coming down during this past week\u2019s crisis.  Boeing was among the top companies spending money last year trying to influence U.S. government decision-making. The Chicago-based aerospace giant spent $15.1 million lobbying the federal government, employing about 100 lobbyists on its behalf. On top of that, Boeing\u2019s political action committee made $2.4\u00a0million in donations to political candidates in 2017 to 2018, eighth most in the country among corporations, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The recipients included 329 current members of Congress. The past few years have been especially good for the company\u2019s bottom line. Boeing booked a record $101.1 billion in 2018 revenue, up 13 percent from the year before, and analysts say about a quarter of that was from government contracts. In 2017, Boeing received an estimated $23.3 billion in taxpayer-funded contract awards, not including classified military funding. And its joint ventures with Lockheed Martin and Bell Helicopter Textron received $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, in federal contract funding in 2017. The company\u2019s stock reached an all-time high of $446 a share this month, before falling after the crash of Ethi\u00ado\u00adpian Airlines Flight 302 a week ago. It closed Friday just under $379 a share. Daniel Auble, a senior researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, called Boeing \u201can excellent illustration\u201d of the \u201cthe undue influence of money in our political system.\u201d In response to questions about the company\u2019s lobbying and campaign spending, Boeing issued a statement defending its practices. \u201cAs the nation\u2019s largest exporter and a leading producer of both commercial and defense aerospace products, there are a number of significant policy issues at the federal, state and local levels with the potential to impact our business, our diverse workforce, and our supply chain. Our team is focused on telling Boeing\u2019s story and supporting policies that advance the aviation industry and U.S. manufacturing in the communities where we live and work.\u201d Boeing\u2019s growth has clearly benefited the United States. Boeing remains one of the country\u2019s top manufacturers, employing an estimated 153,027 people in the United States at a time when Trump has made domestic manufacturing a top political and policy priority. Boeing serves as one of the country\u2019s biggest exporter of goods. \u201cWhenever the government is seeking to enhance exports, usually you\u2019re going to find that Boeing is heavily involved in whatever initiative they\u2019re carrying out,\u201d said Andrew Hunter, a defense industry expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThat was true in the Obama administration, and it\u2019s true in the Trump administration.\u201d Hunter said that in some cases, the government benefits from close relationships with private enterprise, such as when agencies work with private-sector scientists to develop new technologies. \u201cThe risk is obviously that when agencies that are regulatory in nature work closely with a company over a long period of time, the concern is that it could undermine its independence,\u201d Hunter said. Robyn, the former Clinton adviser, said that she became known as \u201cMs. Boeing\u201d at the White House for her intervention on a range of company issues, from titanium imports to relations with machinist unions. She said the focus came from Clinton himself. \u201cIf the Economist did an article about the Boeing-Airbus competition he would underline and it send it over to my boss. .\u2009.\u2009.,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was all over it. And it was all about jobs.\u201d U.S. transportation officials are still pressing for details on why the Ethio\u00adpian Airways Boeing 737 Max 8 jet crashed. Congress is demanding answers about the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s oversight of Boeing, especially after the FAA didn\u2019t move more quickly to ground the company\u2019s planes, instead waiting until regulators in Europe, China, Australia and elsewhere had done so. Muilenburg spoke with Trump twice in the week after the Ethio\u00adpian crash to reassure him of the safety of the planes, giving rise to concerns that the company may have undue influence on safety questions. Larry Kudlow, director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said their conversation should not be misinterpreted. Speaking on C-SPAN\u2019s \u201cNewsmakers\u201d program, Kudlow said Trump delivered a stern message to Muilenburg and that the decision to ground the planes \u201chas nothing to do with commercial considerations as far as we are concerned. And it has everything to do with safety considerations.\u201d Acting FAA administrator Daniel K. Elwell on the \u201cToday\u201d show Friday defended the speed with which U.S. regulators moved to ground the aircraft, saying it was not until they received additional information that they felt confident that a link between a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October, also involving a Boeing 737 Max, and the March 10 Ethio\u00adpian Airways crash was \u201cclose enough.\u201d \u201cYou have to establish more than a gut feeling that two crashes are related before you ground an entire fleet,\u201d he said. U.S. deaths resulting from airplane accidents remain exceedingly rare. In a speech at an air safety forum last year, Elwell pointed out that the country has gone more than nine years, or about 90 million flights, without a fatality. In response to questions about the agency\u2019s relationship with Boeing, the FAA issued a statement crediting it for the \u201ccurrent excellent safety record.\u201d \u201cThe approach we have used over the years is the same approach that has served us well. Safety always is, and will be, our top priority.\u201d Randy Babbitt, who led the FAA under Obama from 2009 to 2011, endorsed that view. \u201cIt used to be years ago that airplane crashes were almost a routine thing. It was like hearing about a car accident,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason there is so much attention around the recent crashes is a testament to how safe the system is.\u201d Boeing also has long been a stalwart aircraft provider to the U.S. military, building nearly 100,000 planes for World War II. In recent years Boeing has pursued a wider range of military contracts, but not without controversy. Boeing secured several large defense contracts in the fall, marking a reversal after it lost competitions to make the F-35 fighter and B-21 bomber to Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, respectively. Boeing also would be the beneficiary of more than $1 billion the Pentagon requested in Trump\u2019s 2020 budget proposal to buy eight F-15X fighter jets. Senior Air Force officials said they were opposed to the expenditure, saying the money would be better spent buying from Lockheed Martin more F-35 fighters, which, unlike the F-15X, are equipped to evade advanced air defenses. There are signs of concern about carelessness at the company, now the second-leading defense contractor in terms of federal sales, and whether the firm is meeting its obligations to the military. On Friday, Will Roper, an assistant secretary of the Air Force, told a House Armed Services subcommittee that he visited Boeing this past week after the Air Force grew alarmed with the amount of trash, tools and other items that were being left behind in new KC-46 tanker planes Boeing was delivering. Boeing began delivering the tankers in January, two years late and some $3 billion over budget. Foreign debris can be sucked through an aircraft\u2019s engines and damage or destroy them. \u201cTo say it bluntly, this is unacceptable,\u201d Roper told lawmakers. \u201cFOD, or foreign object debris, is something we treat very seriously in the Air Force. Our flight lines are spotless. Our depots are spotless, because debris translates into a safety issue.\u201d Roper said he and other service officials reviewed Boeing\u2019s correction plan and came away satisfied. Boeing issued a statement saying: \u201cSafety and quality are our highest priority. We are committed to delivering FOD-free aircraft to our customer and have an agreed-upon action plan in place going forward.\u201d Shanahan, who has almost no government experience, has recused himself from issues related to Boeing. Pentagon officials did not respond to a request for comment. The close relationship between the Pentagon and Boeing is part of a long-standing revolving-door culture in which senior defense officials move back and forth between jobs in government and with defense contractors. In 2004, Darleen Druyun, a high-ranking Air Force procurement official, was sentenced to prison after she admitted that she approved a purchase of 100 refueling airplanes from Boeing at an inflated price of about $20 billion to enhance her job prospects with the company. She also leaked proprietary pricing information from a competitor and helped Boeing secure a separate $4 billion as a thank you for hiring her daughter and future son-in-law. Druyun pleaded guilty to the charges and acknowledged providing special treatment to Boeing. But court records showed Boeing executives played a role as well, pushing forward with employment discussions after Druyun suggested she needed to wait. Boeing commissioned its own review of the scandal and discovered weaknesses related to its practices for hiring former government employees. As of 2016, Boeing employed 84 former Defense Department officials as either executives, board members or lobbyists, according to a report last year from the Project on Government Oversight. That dwarfed the 55 that Boeing competitor Lockheed Martin had on its staff. The author of the report, Mandy Smithberger, said that revolving door raises the question of whether U.S. officials \u2014 regulators among them \u2014 hesitate to say no to Boeing for fear of hurting their prospects if they leave public service. \u201cIt raises the question if they are pulling their punches in order for them to protect their potential employment with the company when they leave government,\u201d she said. Despite the current unease over Boeing\u2019s possible failures regarding the 737 Max, Trump has largely joined his predecessors in becoming a leading salesman for the company. On an earnings call with investors in 2017, Muilenburg said of the company\u2019s relationship with the president: \u201cWe\u2019ve had the privilege of having a very open dialogue with him on business issues.\u201d Six months earlier, speaking at a Boeing plant in South Carolina in 2017, Trump ended his remarks to the crowd with this: \u201cGod bless you, may God bless the United States of America, and God bless Boeing.\u201d","96":"The European Central Bank on Thursday unveiled a new economic rescue package, citing a darkening outlook driven by a slowdown in China, fears that the United Kingdom will make a chaotic exit from the European Union and aftershocks from President Trump\u2019s tariff wars. The mounting worries prompted the bank to cut its growth forecast for 2019 by nearly one-third to just above 1 percent. ECB President Mario Draghi also said he would maintain rock-bottom interest rates through the end of this year, several months longer than previously planned, and funnel more credit to banks in hopes of spurring business lending. The move came less than three months after European authorities said the 19-nation euro zone economy no longer needed unusual help, capping  more than a decade-long $3 trillion stimulus following the global financial crisis. Thursday\u2019s about-face sounded alarms about a global slowdown that caught officials off guard. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly significant move,\u201d said Adam Tooze, a Columbia University historian and author of \u201cCrashed,\u201d a history of recent financial crises. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to the anemic quality of Europe\u2019s recovery and the [failures] of the ECB that we\u2019ve had to go through this roller coaster.\u201d For now, the United States remains an island of relative stability, though Federal Reserve officials in recent days have voiced concerns that the economic expansion could be fraying. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 200 points or nearly 1\u00a0percent on the European announcement. Despite the accumulation of bad news, the global economy is still likely to grow this year. The bigger concern is that central banks like the ECB have little ammunition to fight a deeper downturn, whether triggered by events in Europe or elsewhere. European interest rates are already negative, meaning that banks actually pay authorities in Frankfurt to hold their deposits. In the United States, the Fed\u2019s benchmark lending rate is less than one-half what it was on the eve of the global financial crisis. So Chair Jerome H. Powell would have little room to cut rates to spur growth if a recession occurs. \u201cWhat\u2019s scary is this is the ECB signaling they are running out of ammo,\u201d said Adam Posen, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. \u201cIf we overshoot into a genuine recession, that\u2019s why I get genuinely freaked out.\u201d If that happens, European monetary authorities will have the greatest difficulty. The Federal Reserve and the People\u2019s Bank of China are in relatively better shape, he added. Fed officials have changed their thinking about how high interest rates should be when the economy is purring at an ideal pace, one that doesn\u2019t need to be accelerated or cooled down. Before the financial crisis, the\u00a0Fed believed that inflation-adjusted \u201cneutral\u201d rate was 3 percent. Today, it\u2019s probably around 1\u00a0percent. The likelihood that rates will often be lower than in the past \u2014 even when the economy is growing at its potential \u2014 \u201climits the amount of space available for cutting the federal fund rate to buffer the economy from adverse developments,\u201d Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors, said Thursday in a speech at Princeton University. If needed, the Fed could resume its bond purchases, known as quantitative easing. Along with such monetary tools, the United States could raise spending or cut taxes to fight rising unemployment. The Trump administration already cut taxes by $1.5 trillion in 2017, helping drive the national debt to nearly $22\u00a0trillion. So far, even as the public debt swells, financial markets have been willing to lend the government as much as it wants. Borrowing costs, measured by the 2.6\u00a0percent yield on the 10-year Treasury security, are less than one-half the 50-year average. Investors may not remain so sanguine indefinitely. For now, the economy is humming. Job growth in the United States remains robust, with employers hiring nearly 240,000 workers each month over the past year. Small businesses broke a 45-year-old record for job creation in February, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Brainard cited recent statistics on retail sales, consumer confidence and residential construction that suggested a \u201csoftening\u201d of economic activity. The economy in the first quarter has all but stalled, growing at an annual rate of just 0.5 percent, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s GDPNow forecast. Weakness abroad reverberates in the United States through lower orders for American exports and financial market volatility, she added. More than 40 percent of sales by companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, a key stock market benchmark, come from overseas. \u201cWe are more vulnerable than what people are suggesting,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank. Indeed, in Paris on Wednesday, Laurence Boone, chief economist for the 36-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, gave a downbeat assessment of the global outlook before cutting her forecasts for the global economy and every advanced nation. \u201cIt does not look very good,\u201d Boone said. \u201cGlobal growth looked really good in 2017 but it has slowed markedly since then.\u201d Her formal presentation carried a stark warning: \u201cVulnerabilities in China, Europe and financial markets could derail the global economy.\u201d Tensions from the trade war between the United States and China, along with uncertainty over the U.K.\u2019s planned Brexit, have sapped consumer and business confidence. China, where government leaders have been trying to wean the economy from its addiction to debt-fueled growth, also is slowing more sharply than had been anticipated. In the fourth quarter, world trade volume fell by 0.9 percent, its worst performance since 2009, according to the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis. The ECB\u2019s actions indicate that the authorities expect economic weakness to persist for at least a year, according to Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cThey\u2019re a little bit more worried than Dr. Draghi has let on,\u201d Weinberg told clients on a Thursday webinar. The global downturn reflects a buildup in business inventories and should be \u201cshort and shallow,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cAll recessions do not have to result in a financial crisis.\u201d Still, Dan Alpert, managing partner of Westwood Capital, said Europe\u2019s weakness will inevitably spill over into the United States and China. As the euro weakens, European customers won\u2019t be able to afford as many American or Chinese exports. \u201cThis is no way to run a global economy,\u201d Alpert said.","97":"With Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0Sherrod Brown was a populist before it was cool. A quarter-century before Donald Trump swept the industrial Midwest by promising to reverse manufacturing declines and renegotiate trade deals, the Ohio Democrat got elected to Congress with a campaign built around his opposition to NAFTA. At a rally outside Cleveland last night, Brown kicked off a \u201cDignity of Work\u201d tour that will take him to all four early states ahead of a likely bid for the presidency. In a 20-minute speech, Brown contrasted his brand of populism with that of the man he seeks to replace and touted himself as the candidate who would post up best against Trump in 2020. \u201cTrump has used his phony populism to divide Americans,\u201d the senator said. \u201cHe uses his phony populism to distract from the fact that he has used the White House to enrich billionaires like himself. Real populism is not racist. Real populism is not anti-Semitic. Real populists don\u2019t engage in hate speech and don\u2019t rip babies from families at the border. Real populists don\u2019t insult people\u2019s intelligence by lying.\u201d About 300 people came to cheer him on at Supply Side USA, which makes packaging and shipping products for retailers, even though it was 4 degrees below zero outside. Brown seized on the November announcement by General Motors that it will close its Lordstown plant outside Youngstown as an illustration of Trump\u2019s failure to follow through on his campaign rhetoric. \u201cHe has betrayed workers, and now that their jobs are on the line, not only has he not lifted a finger to help them, he actually passed a tax law that could reward GM for making cars in Mexico instead of here in Ohio,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight like hell to keep GM in Lordstown and save those jobs.\u201d -- Brown, with a boyish smile and a penchant for wearing a backpack around the Capitol, is older than he looks. The 66-year-old even qualifies as a \u201cWatergate baby\u201d: Just a few months after graduating in 1974 with a degree in Russian studies from Yale University, Brown rode the anti-Nixon Democratic wave to secure a seat in the state House. He has held public office for all but two of the past 44 years. He got elected to Congress after eight years as Ohio\u2019s secretary of state. After seven terms, Brown toppled incumbent Republican Sen. Mike DeWine in 2006 by capitalizing on the backlash to George W. Bush, the Iraq War and the Colombian free trade agreement. -- While Brown has changed little over the years, Ohio has changed a lot. The perennial swing state has become redder, as culturally conservative, working-class whites have gravitated toward the GOP. Ironically, for example, DeWine just got elected as Ohio\u2019s governor in November as Brown secured a third term. -- Brown said his reelection by seven points this past November in a state Trump carried by eight points two years before shows \u201ca strong progressive can win \u2014 and win decisively \u2014 in the heartland.\u201d He appealed to many of the blue-collar voters who flipped to Trump after backing Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. That puts Brown in the same lane as former vice president Joe Biden \u2014 who has also staked his rationale for a potential run on appealing to this crowd. -- Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, didn\u2019t wear a blue or white collar during his rally. He wore a black sweater over a T-shirt and argued that the conventional wisdom that Democrats need to pick between populism and progressivism in 2020 is a false choice. \u201cToo often, people act like our party has to choose between advocating for strong progressive values that excite our base or talking to working-class voters about their lives. For us, it\u2019s not either-or. It\u2019s both,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI voted against NAFTA and the misnamed Defense of Marriage Act and the Iraq War. I\u2019ve stood up to Wall Street and the gun lobby.\u201d Sherrod Brown and his wife, Connie Schultz, walk to their polling place in Cleveland last November. (Phil Long\/AP) -- Warming up the crowd last night, Connie Schultz \u2014 a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and the senator\u2019s wife \u2014 noted that she wouldn\u2019t have agreed to date Brown back in 2003 if he was not a devoted liberal champion on social issues. \u201cI had to look up his voting record first,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to know that he had a 100 percent record on women\u2019s rights and gay rights. And he was 100 percent! Don\u2019t you all wish you could just check the voting record before you go out with someone?\u201d Schultz also recalled introducing Brown to her father. A utility worker who had been active in his union, he was reluctant to meet the new boyfriend because he was a politician, she said. But Brown won him over by talking about the importance of organized labor. \u201cMy dad said afterward: \u2018You know what? He\u2019s us in a tie.\u2019\u201d -- Indeed, Brown is an old-school trade unionist who is tight with labor groups. (Ohio AFL-CIO president Tim Burga was at last night\u2019s rally.) But the senator went out of his way at the rally to make clear that he\u2019s not solely focused on helping out white guys like his wife\u2019s dad, who has since passed away. After praising immigrants from Trinidad and China who were in the room, he said: \u201cCorporate profits have soared. Executive compensation has exploded. Workers are producing more than ever before. But their wages are flat. \u2026 And we know it\u2019s even worse for women and people of color. They face the same challenges, on top of sexism and racism, that make it even harder to get ahead, no matter how hard they work.\u201d -- If he\u2019s not the nominee, Brown will almost certainly be on vice-presidential shortlists \u2014 especially if Democrats nominate a woman and\/or African American. \u201cIf I don\u2019t run for president or if I do, I want \u2018dignity of work\u2019 to be the centerpiece of every Democratic campaign in the country,\u201d Brown said in a conference call Wednesday afternoon with Ohio reporters, per the Columbus Dispatch. Sherrod Brown greets supporters after last night's rally.\u00a0(Tony Dejak\/AP) -- Brown kicks off his Iowa swing at 6 p.m. tonight with a meet-and-greet in Cresco, a town of 3,900 near the border with Minnesota in rural northeast Iowa. Tomorrow he will attend a roundtable with the Chamber of Commerce in Clear Lake, sit down with farmers at the library in Perry and tour an advanced manufacturing center in Waterloo. On Saturday, he\u2019s going to a popular cafe in Dubuque before holding a roundtable discussion with labor leaders in Clinton. That gives him exposure to business, agriculture and labor types on his first foray. -- He will then go to New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, and Brown name-checked each of them before walking off the stage last night to Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cBorn to Run.\u201d \u201cAll across the country, hard work isn\u2019t paying off like it should,\u201d he said. \u201cWe fight for the construction worker in Manchester. The physical therapist in Reno. The restaurant worker in Florence. The teacher in Iowa City.\u201d \u00a0-- But Iowa, more than anywhere else, is central to Brown\u2019s theory of the case. His hopes depend on a top-three finish in the caucuses that will kick off the sprint to the nomination next February. The Cleveland Plain Dealer\u2019s Seth Richardson likens Brown to former senator Tom Harkin in a piece that highlights \u201cstriking similarities between Iowa and Ohio.\u201d \u201cDes Moines \u2014 a city of 217,000 \u2014 is the epicenter, but in a state of more than 3 million people, urban liberals might not be the bedrock of a Brown coalition,\u201d Richardson reports. \u201cThe eastern half of the state, especially along the Mississippi River, is rife with old manufacturing communities that have suffered from outsourcing and economic contraction. Iowa is a so-called right-to-work state, but union membership and activity is still significant in these areas. The western half is predominantly rural and dominated by the prairie populists \u2014 the farmer community, New Deal-type Democrats who closely resemble the populists from President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s era. \u2026 If all of these communities sound familiar, it\u2019s because Brown has done well with precisely those types of voters. The industrial parts of the state are his bread and butter. Brown consistently outperforms other Democrats in rural Western Ohio. \u2026 \u201cFive of the seven counties Brown is visiting flipped from supporting Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016. Pete D\u2019Alessandro, a Democratic operative who ran Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 Iowa operation and has worked for Youngstown-area Rep. Tim Ryan, said Brown\u2019s brand of populism already runs rampant in Iowa. \u2026 \u2018There are those prairie populists. There\u2019s a lot of populists in Dubuque and Clinton County and the Quad Cities. There\u2019s certainly populists in Iowa City and places like that,\u2019 D\u2019Alessandro said.\u201d -- Another asset Brown has is Sarah Benzing, the longtime chief of staff in his Senate office. She\u2019s an Iowa native who has run statewide campaigns (and managed her boss\u2019s 2012 reelection). Sarah has deep ties to both the Democratic establishment and the grass roots in Iowa. SCHULTZ STUMBLING:\u00a0 -- Since announcing his interest in an independent presidential bid, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has leveled most of his criticism at Democrats. Michael Scherer reports: \u201cIn a four-day blitz of interviews across major broadcast networks, Schultz has been outspoken in his criticism of liberal Democratic leaders, saying their policies for expanding Medicare or taxing the wealthy are 'not American,' 'misinformed' and 'ridiculous.' A billionaire who supports abortion rights and more gun regulation, Schultz has called himself a 'lifelong Democrat.' But he now describes the party as an unnavigable institution, beholden to its liberal fringe and inconsequential to improvement of the country. 'Whether a Democrat wins the presidency or Donald Trump is reelected \u2014 I hope not \u2014 nothing is going to change because our politics and our government is broken,' Schultz, 65, said Wednesday on MSNBC\u2019s 'Morning Joe.'\u00a0'I do not believe in what the Democratic Party stands for.'\u201d A social media misstep: \u201cSchultz\u2019s personal Twitter account seemed to delve even further Wednesday into hard-nosed politics, with a tweet praising the \u2018thoughtful analysis\u2019 of a conservative opinion column praising his run. The column called Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) a \u2018shrill .\u2009.\u2009. quasi-socialist\u2019 and referred to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as \u2018Fauxcahontas,\u2019 a jibe at her family\u2019s claim of Native American ancestry. The tweet was later deleted after a Washington Post reporter inquired, and an adviser to Schultz said the former executive was not personally responsible for sending the message.\u201d -- Giving more ammo to Trump, Schultz said he once refused to give a campaign contribution to Warren out of fear that her policy ideas will drive the United States toward socialism.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t believe the country should be heading to socialism,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cI think she believes in programs that will lead to a level of socialism in America.\u201d (John Wagner) -- Schultz could not answer when asked by \u201cMorning Joe\u201d host Mika Brzezinski how much an 18-ounce box of Cheerios costs. When Brzezinski told him it costs $4, Schultz replied, \u201cThat's a lot.\u201d Many on the Internet pointed out it\u2019s about the cost of a grande-size\u00a0drink from Starbucks. (CNBC) -- Schultz is planning visits to the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada \u2014 even though he's not running for either party's nomination. CNBC\u2019s Brian Schwartz\u00a0reports: \u201cThe dates and specific locations within the states are \u2018not all locked in,\u2019 [a person with knowledge of Schultz\u2019s plans said]. Schultz's book tour schedule has yet to include any of these states, but his website also notes \u2018more dates and locations coming soon.\u2019\u201d -- Starbucks issued guidance to all its employees, including baristas, on how to defuse tense conversations with angry customers about their former CEO's potential spoiler campaign. The coffee chain\u2019s weekly update read, in part:\u00a0\u201cIf a customer asks if we are selling Howard\u2019s book at Starbucks: No, the books are available at bookstores and online. If a customer attempts to investigate, or share aggressive political opinions, attempt to diffuse the situation by sharing: We respect everyone\u2019s opinion. Our goal is simply to create a warm and welcoming space where we can all gather, as a community, over great coffee. If asked about Howard\u2019s political intentions: Howard\u2019s future plans are up to him.\u201d (HuffPost) -- Voting records indicate that Schultz has cast a ballot in just 11 of the past 38 elections in Washington state; he stayed home during the 2006 and 2014 midterms. From the Seattle Times\u2019s Danny Westneat: \u201cSchultz has at least voted in every election for the office he\u2019s now seeking, the presidency. He also voted in the most recent midterms, in 2018. But he has skipped most of the state and local elections over the years, as well as some of the big midterms (like in 2014, when Republicans retook the U.S. Senate, and 2006, when Democrats \u2018blue-waved\u2019 the Bush administration).\u201d -- \u201cSchultz has brought a whole latte trouble on himself,\u201d Dana Milbank writes in a brutal column: \u201cJust about everybody this side of Tucker Carlson believes we do not need another old, white, insult-doling, super-caffeinated billionaire who is stingy with charity and believes he alone can fix the nation\u2019s problems. \u2026 When he owned the National Basketball Association\u2019s Seattle SuperSonics, he reportedly rewarded employees with $3.50 Starbucks gift cards, custom-made because standard [$5] ones were too generous. Schultz\u2019s critics have questioned his civic-mindedness ... because, after declaring the Sonics a \u2018public trust\u2019 to have the team in Seattle, he sold it to a group that moved it to Oklahoma City. And some wonder why, if he truly thinks Trump is \u2018despicable,\u2019 Starbucks rents space from Trump properties.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) questions attorney general nominee William Barr during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Jan. 15. (Carolyn Kaster\/AP) MORE 2020 BUZZ: -- The most-read item on The Post\u2019s website this morning is a George Will column arguing that Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is the Democrat best positioned to defeat Trump: \u201cHer state has a significant farming population and agribusiness (e.g., Cargill, General Mills, Land O\u2019Lakes, Hormel), so she has had practice speaking to populations and interests that Democrats need, and speaking against trade wars in which farmers quickly become collateral damage. She has become informed about what could be one of the most salient issues in 2020: the high costs of prescription drugs. In the Almanac of American Politics\u2019 most recent (2015) vote rankings, she was the 27th-most-liberal senator, liberal enough to soothe other liberals without annoying everyone else. As the bidding war for the affection of the Democratic left spirals into inanity ... Klobuchar is the potential top-tier candidate most apt to resist forfeiting the general election while winning the nomination.\u201d -- As he weighs a presidential bid, Michael Bloomberg is devoting hundreds of millions of dollars to a data-driven political group aimed at defeating Trump. The Atlantic\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere reports: \u201cThough a budget has not been set, this effort would almost certainly become the biggest and most powerful political organization in the country overnight. It would also be the only real counter to the operation that Trump\u2019s campaign put together in 2016, which allowed it to reach out to millions of voters in a more targeted, under-the-radar way, and helped deliver the election to Trump by shaping their thinking for months and then activating them on Election Day. \u2026 This may yet turn this into an effort on behalf of a Bloomberg campaign, with his advisers carefully watching [Joe] Biden\u2019s moves to decide what to do, and asking around for intel on the former vice president\u2019s deliberations. They doubt there\u2019s room in the Democratic field for both.\u201d -- Democratic 2020 candidates are generally supportive of a \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d even as the proposal so far lacks any specifics. Chelsea Janes reports: \u201cA bill is expected to emerge soon, but its language has not been set, a congressional aide said. Nonetheless, the Green New Deal already has elbowed its way into Democratic dialogue \u2014 and, by extension, into a prominent place in 2020 campaign rhetoric. It is a way for Democrats angered at the Trump administration\u2019s dismissal of environmental science to demonstrate their desire to attack climate change, with the explicit details left until later. It is also an idea that divides potential Democratic blocs \u2014 appealing to the younger voters the party wants and seen more skeptically by the blue-collar voters the party needs.\u201d -- Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, who has not officially announced a presidential bid, are battling it out to win support from the Congressional Black Caucus. Politico\u2019s Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez and John Bresnahan report: Booker and Harris\u00a0\u201care aggressively courting black lawmakers as they look to build networks in key presidential voting states like South Carolina, Ohio and Michigan. Both showed up at the CBC\u2019s weekly meeting on Wednesday. As Harris worked the room, Booker told at least two members that he would call them afterward, according to sources at the meeting. But Joe Biden could complicate their plans: The former vice president is a longtime ally of the CBC and has been reaching out to veteran black lawmakers to talk about the race, according to multiple members.\u201d -- The Wall Street Journal dubs Beto O\u2019Rourke a \u201cfront-runner\u201d for the Democratic nomination. (I wouldn't go that far.)\u00a0Reid Epstein writes from El Paso: \u201cBut if Mr. O\u2019Rourke jumps into a presidential primary that could include more than 20 other Democrats, saying he is better than the incumbent isn\u2019t likely to be a strong enough argument to win the nomination and the chance to take on [Trump] in the general election, his friends and political allies say. \u2018If he ran for president, it would be much different,\u2019 said Steve Ortega, a longtime O\u2019Rourke friend who in 2005 was elected with him to the El Paso City Council. \u2018He\u2019s not going to take anyone by surprise. He\u2019s no longer the insurgent. He\u2019s one of the front-runners. It\u2019s a different deal.\u2019\u201d -- Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) declined to say whether she would endorse Trump in 2020. From John Wagner: \u201c\u2018I\u2019m not prepared at this point to make that decision,\u2019 Collins, one of the more moderate members of the Senate GOP, said during an interview on \u2018PBS NewsHour.\u2019 After saying she has not focused on the race yet, Collins was pressed by host Judy Woodruff on whether she would endorse Trump later. \u2018I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to have to see what happens between now and then and look at what his record is,\u2019 Collins said. \u2026 When asked whether she might endorse another Republican, Collins said, \u2018I\u2019m neither ruling it in nor ruling it out.\u2019\u201d -- Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), another vulnerable incumbent, said he will endorse Trump's reelection despite his \u201cdifferences\u201d with the president. \u201cI know what Kamala Harris and I know what Bernie Sanders will do to Colorado, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ll be supporting the president,\u201d he told the conservative site IJR. GET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b ICE has been force-feeding six immigrants who have been on a month-long hunger strike in a Texas detention facility. A relative of one of the hunger-strike participants said those who are being force-fed through plastic nasal tubes are having persistent nosebleeds and vomiting several times a day. The detainees say they are protesting guards\u2019 verbal abuse and threats of deportation. (AP) Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) was awarded more than $580,000 by a jury in a civil lawsuit against his neighbor, who attacked him in 2017 and broke six of his ribs. Paul said during the trial that he had trouble breathing after Rene Boucher, who pleaded guilty to the assault last March, tackled him over a landscaping dispute. (Michael Brice-Saddler) Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.) called for a hate crimes investigation into the attack on \u201cEmpire\u201d actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago. Rush wrote in a letter to the FBI director that he's \u201cdisturbed\u201d by reports that two assailants referred to Smollett by racist and homophobic slurs, even attempting to put a noose around his neck. (Felicia Sonmez) A group of Democratic lawmakers nominated former New Mexico governor and longtime diplomat Bill Richardson for the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with North Korea. Richardson has repeatedly traveled to North Korea to help secure the release of American hostages, including Otto Warmbier.

But some experts warn that e-cigarettes pose other risks, such as potential harm to the lungs or the possibility that smokers will end up using both regular and electronic cigarettes. (Laurie McGinley) New research indicates the loss of local newspapers across the United States has contributed to political polarization. When they lack local news outlets, citizens are more likely to rely on national sources to stay informed and will in turn apply their opinions of national politicians to local leaders, according to a new study. (AP) A University of Central Florida student was arrested after police found a machine gun and bump stock in his car on campus. Authorities arrested Max Bennett Chambers and charged him with two felonies after an anonymous tip warned a student had accessories to turn a semiautomatic weapon into an automatic weapon. (Susan Svrluga) TRUMP VS. CONGRESS: -- The era of accommodation is over, and Trump faces an increasingly adversarial Congress \u2014 in both parties. From Seung Min Kim, Sean Sullivan and Josh Dawsey: \u201cDemocratic committee chairs are threatening subpoenas for his top officials. \u2026 Several Cabinet secretaries have already declined to testify before committees on contentious topics such as the impact of the shutdown and the administration\u2019s abandoned policy of separating migrant families. In one example, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) sent a blistering letter this week to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen for not appearing \u2026 to discuss the administration\u2019s border security policies. \u2018If she says she\u2019s not coming, we\u2019ll subpoena her to the committee,\u2019 Thompson said in an interview Wednesday. \u2026 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar have also declined invitations to appear before Congress \u2026 In private, Trump has told aides he wants to take an aggressive posture toward such oversight \u2014 including fighting any effort by Congress to obtain his tax returns all the way to the Supreme Court. ... \u201cSenate Republicans asserted their independence from Trump on several fronts this week. \u2026 Some Republican senators are urging the president to keep his distance from a 17-member committee tasked with coming up with a border security deal and leave it to lawmakers to haggle over the specifics. Republicans on the bipartisan committee were slated to go to the White House later this week for discussions on averting a shutdown, although that meeting appears to have been called off. \u2018Let us do our work,\u2019 said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). ...\u00a0Senior Republicans are [also] warning him away from a national emergency declaration to build a border wall. ... \u201cOn Wednesday, some Senate GOP leaders rebutted Trump\u2019s latest criticism of his own intelligence officials, which the president issued in a tweet. \u2018I would prefer the president would stay off Twitter,\u2019 said Sen. John Thune (S.D.), the chamber\u2019s second-ranking Republican. \u2018And, you know, particularly with regard to these important national security issues where, you know, you\u2019ve got people who are experts and have a background and are professionals.\u2019 Sen. Roy Blunt (Mo.), another top Republican, said, \u2018This is an intel community that the president has largely put in place. And I have confidence in them. And I think he should, too.\u2019 \u201cSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) introduced this week an amendment to Middle East policy legislation that rebuked Trump\u2019s decision to pull back troops from Syria and Afghanistan. \u2026 The amendment will come to the Senate floor for a vote on Thursday. If it passes, it would be the first clear rebuke of Trump\u2019s foreign policy in the Senate this year.\u201d -- House Democrats offered their opening bid to Trump on a funding deal to keep the government open, a proposal that includes zero dollars for physical barriers on the border. Erica Werner, John Wagner and Mike DeBonis report: \u201cIt came just hours after Trump dug in on his conditions for signing off on such a deal, writing on Twitter that lawmakers would be 'wasting their time' if they\u2019re not considering a wall or physical barrier on the southern border. But in a sign of how difficult it may be for lawmakers to strike a compromise that Trump can support, Democrats dismissed the president\u2019s insistence on physical barriers on the border, arguing that security funds would be better spent elsewhere.\u201d -- Trump also appears to be making all the preparations to declare a national emergency at the southern border if a funding deal falls through, meeting with advisers this week to talk through the option. Politico\u2019s Nancy Cook reports: \u201cTrump met with his budget chief, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Jared Kushner and other top officials, including White House lawyers, on Tuesday to walk through the logistics of such a move. And White House aides have been quietly meeting with outside conservative political groups to build support for the president to take such an action. Those talking points, which emphasize Trump\u2019s legal authority, have begun to show up in such conservative media outlets as Breitbart News.\u201d -- Saying publicly what he\u2019s been saying privately for weeks, Trump criticized Paul Ryan during an interview with the Daily Caller. He accused the former speaker of promising to get him the wall if he signed a bill a year ago to fund the government and not following through. \u201cAnd then he went lame duck,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd once he went lame duck, it was just really an exercise in waving to people and the power was gone so I was very disappointed. I was very disappointed in Paul because the wall was so desperately needed. And I\u2019ll get the wall.\u201d Trump also said that his State of the Union guests will be border-related. -- An undocumented worker who left her job at one of Trump\u2019s golf clubs after publicly disclosing her immigration status will attend his State of the Union. Elise Viebeck reports: \u201cVictorina Morales, who was born in Guatemala, will be a guest of Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a New Jersey Democrat, when the president speaks to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night.\u201d -- McConnell denounced a Democratic proposal to make Election Day a federal holiday as a \u201cpower grab.\u201d Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201cMcConnell was speaking about H.R. 1, legislation that Democrats have made a centerpiece of their agenda since retaking the House earlier this month. In remarks on the Senate floor, the majority leader\u00a0said Democrats \u2018want taxpayers on the hook for generous new benefits for federal bureaucrats and government employees,\u2019 including making Election Day a \u2018new paid holiday for government workers.\u2019 \u2026 The far-reaching legislation would also prohibit the purging of voter rolls, require presidential and vice-presidential candidates to release their tax returns, compel states to adopt independent redistricting commissions and create a matching system for small-dollar donations to congressional campaigns, among other changes.\u201d -- The House approved a pay raise for civilian federal employees. Mike DeBonis reports: \u201cThe 2.6 percent raise is calibrated to match that given to military personnel in a 2019 spending bill passed last year. [Trump] subjected the rest of the federal workforce to a pay freeze in a Dec. 28 executive order, though Congress could override that at any time. \u2026 Twenty-nine Republicans joined Democrats in voting for the pay raise, but most did not. GOP leaders protested that the bill had not been vetted in committee and that across-the-board pay raises were bad policy.\u201d -- House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) is aiming to disrupt Democratic control of the chamber. Paul Kane reports: \u201cHe admits that he saw the majority as likely lost late last summer, before the November midterm elections delivered a body-blow loss of 40 Republican seats. So he began reading about how coalition governments work in countries with parliamentary systems. He has been studying how other minority parties worked when dealing with a powerful House majority, what strategy they can employ and which moves have an impact. \u2026 He promised that the Freedom Caucus is coming up with ideas to rebel against Pelosi\u2019s majority, to upend the place in a similar style, if not the same outcomes, as its rebellious days in the majority.\u201d -- Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) reiterated his opposition to Trump judicial nominee Thomas Farr over his record on race issues. Emma Dumain reports for the State: Scott\u00a0\u201csaid his worries were not alleviated by a Wednesday meeting between the two men on Capitol Hill \u2014 convened as a courtesy to North Carolina Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Farr ally. The meeting coincided with a letter that 31 conservative leaders, activists, elected officials and attorneys sent to Scott Tuesday in Farr\u2019s defense. \u2026 In his statement Wednesday, Scott said, contrary to the suggestion in Tuesday\u2019s letter that he never had met with Farr or done the necessary research into his background, \u2018I have met with him multiple times over the past 18 months, both in person and via phone.\u2019\u201d President Trump talks up his role in a now-uncertain deal to bring jobs to Wisconsin with Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou, center, and SoftBank CEO\u00a0Masayoshi Son during a groundbreaking event in June\u00a0in Mount\u00a0Pleasant, Wis. (Evan Vucci\/AP) THE TRUMP ECONOMY: -- Broken promises: The technology company Foxconn announced it is reconsidering plans to build a factory in Wisconsin, significantly altering a jobs deal repeatedly touted by Trump. Danielle Paquette reports: \u201cThe Taiwanese technology juggernaut initially pledged in 2017 to construct a $10 billion display panel plant and create up to 13,000 jobs in the state\u2019s southeastern corner over the next 15 years. The positions would pay an average annual wage of $53,000, the firm said \u2014 a solid salary in the manufacturing realm. In exchange, Wisconsin agreed to give Foxconn at least $3 billion in state tax credits and breaks \u2026 Foxconn said Wednesday it still aimed to create 13,000 jobs in the state but did not respond to questions about the nature of the positions, when they would arrive and what precisely inspired the shift. \u2026 Trump celebrated\u00a0the deal in the East Room of the White House in 2017 and attended a groundbreaking ceremony last summer in Racine County.\u201d -- Foxconn\u00a0\u201cinitially said it expected to employ about 5,200 people by the end of 2020; a company source said that figure now looks likely to be closer to 1,000 workers,\u201d Reuters adds. -- Apparently bowing to public pressure from the president, the Federal Reserve announced it will now take a more \u201cpatient\u201d approach to raising interest rates this year than previously planned.\u00a0Heather Long reports: \u201cThe Fed opted Wednesday to leave interest rates unchanged \u2014 at a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent \u2014 and the central bank signaled it was unlikely to hike rates soon, a big shift from December when the Fed predicted two more rate increases this year. The central bank pinned the change on the uncertainty around the slowdown in China and Europe as well as what would happen with Brexit, U.S.-China trade talks and any further government shutdowns. \u2026 [Fed Chairman Jerome Powell] strongly dismissed the notion that the Fed caved to Trump\u2019s demands.\u201d -- Groundhog Day: Trump yesterday celebrated the Dow breaking 25,000. He posted an almost identical tweet\u00a0celebrating the same milestone\u00a0last January: THERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Trump once again derided the expertise of the intelligence community after agency heads testified that Iran appeared to be complying with the 2015 nuclear deal.\u00a0Shane Harris and John Wagner report: \u201cTrump\u2019s attack had less to do with the substance of the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusions than it did with undermining public confidence in the agencies themselves as neutral purveyors of information, [one] official said.\u00a0In his criticism, Trump seemed to ignore the many points where he and the intelligence agencies agree.\u00a0In written testimony on behalf of all intelligence agencies, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats described Iran as actively plotting terrorist attacks in Europe, mounting aggressive cyber-campaigns against the United States and developing ballistic missiles that \u2018continue to pose a threat to countries across the Middle East.\u2019 \u201cBut since taking office, Trump has fixated on Iran\u2019s suspended nuclear weapons program. Administration officials have pressed intelligence analysts on why they believe Iran is in compliance with the nuclear agreement and questioned whether there is additional information that would show Tehran is violating its terms, according to current and former officials with knowledge of conversations between the administration and intelligence officials.\u201d -- Trump singled out Coats while ranting about coverage of the intelligence chiefs' testimony behind closed doors. CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins and Caroline Kelly report: \u201cThe President didn't see Coats' full testimony in front of lawmakers that took place on Tuesday, but he was furious Wednesday as he watched television chyrons blare that the officials had contradicted him. The snippets of Coats saying that North Korea had \u2018halted its provocative behavior related to its WMD program\u2019 but was unlikely to \u2018completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capabilities\u2019 angered him \u2026 [But Trump] didn't single Coats out in his tweets like he did verbally. The President was more frustrated with the coverage than the assessments of the intelligence chiefs, who brief him on national security matters regularly.\u201d -- Special counsel Bob Mueller\u2019s team said discovery materials in its\u00a0case against an indicted Russian company were used in a cyber-disinformation campaign meant to discredit the investigation. Spencer S. Hsu reports: \u201cThe prosecutors made the allegation in a federal court filing Wednesday as they asked a U.S. judge to reject a request by lawyers from Concord Management and Consulting to share sensitive evidence outside the United States in trial preparation with Concord\u2019s owner and indicted co-defendant, Russian businessman Yevgeniy Prigozhin. \u2026 The alleged breach, Mueller wrote, argues against allowing more sensitive evidence to be sent to Russia to be shared with defendants because it \u2018unreasonably risks the national security interests of the United States.\u2019 \u2026 \u201cIn the government\u2019s filing, prosecutors said that on Oct. 22 a newly created Twitter account with the handle \u2018@HackingRedstone\u2019 claimed it had penetrated a Russian server and gained access to the \u2018Mueller probe\u2019s database\u2019 with information on the Concord case. \u2018You can view all the files Mueller had about the IRA and Russian collusion. Enjoy the reading!\u2019 the court filing states that a tweet read ...\u00a0Mueller\u2019s filing said the online account that published the materials was registered in 2018 by a user with an Internet address in Russia. The account has been suspended.\u201d -- Trump said he would allow the DOJ to decide whether to release Mueller\u2019s report. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to make their decision within the Justice Department,\u201d Trump said\u00a0in his Daily Caller interview. \u201cThey will make the decision as to what they do.\u201d He added he has not spoken to acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker about the investigation as it nears its close. -- A law firm that has previously represented Russian entities is representing a client challenging a grand jury subpoena related to Mueller\u2019s investigation. CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz and Caroline Kelly report: \u201cTed Boutrous, the lawyer for the Reporters Committee, confirmed CNN's prior reporting that Alston & Bird represents the foreign government-owned company facing scrutiny from [Mueller]. That subpoena case is now before the Supreme Court, and Boutrous' team is attempting to get parts of it unsealed.\u201d -- Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is upset about what he views as heavy-handed tactics in the FBI arrest of Trump ally Roger Stone and has requested a briefing.\u00a0Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201cIn the letter, Graham said he was concerned about the way the arrest was conducted, particularly \u2018the number of agents involved, the tactics employed, the timing of the arrest\u2019 and whether the FBI tipped off members of the media. \u2026 Graham asked the FBI to brief his committee and answer a list of questions about Stone\u2019s arrest by Feb. 5, the same day as Trump\u2019s State of the Union address. Later Wednesday, in an interview with the conservative Daily Caller website, Trump said he would \u2018think about\u2019 asking the FBI to review its policies on the use of force in light of Stone\u2019s arrest.\u201d -- A federal judge declined to unseal criminal charges against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Rachel Weiner reports: \u201cThe existence of the case against Assange was mistakenly referenced by a prosecutor filing a motion in an unrelated case and confirmed by The Washington Post and other news outlets. The Reporter\u2019s Committee for Freedom of the Press, a journalism nonprofit, filed a lawsuit to unseal the charges, arguing there is no longer any justification for keeping the details of the case secret. But [Judge Leonie M. Brinkema] concluded \u2018an obviously erroneous filing in an unrelated case, public speculation, news stories, and anonymous statements by government officials does not supply a level of certainty comparable to that afforded by official acknowledgment.\u2019\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Trump claimed that his wall is already being built, a falsehood that The Post's Fact Checker previously awarded three Pinocchios: He also repeated his dubious claim that existing border barriers constitute the wall he promised during the 2016 campaign: A former deputy CIA director challenged Trump's swipe at leaders of the intelligence community: John Sipher retired from the CIA in 2014 after a 28-year career in the Clandestine Service, which included serving in Moscow and running the agency's Russia operations: A Harvard law professor reacted to reports that Russians are using information from Mueller's investigation: Chuck Schumer blasted Mitch McConnell's criticism of a Democratic proposal to make Election Day a federal holiday: The former director of the Office of Government Ethics suggested this compromise: Sen.

Working more than that and into late-night hours requires parental consent. A six-hour work day must include 30-minute breaks. A new bill would scrap these rules, a move that opponents fear would enable bad actors who expose minors to excessively long working hours. But there\u2019s another factor that has raised concerns: The bill\u2019s author, Republican state Sen. Chip Perfect, owns a ski resort \u2014 and he employs hundreds of minors \u2014 which has led to questions about his motivations.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT: \u201cFailed abortion bill draws GOP outrage against Va.

The furor escalated quickly after Republicans circulated a video of Del. Kathy Tran (D-Fairfax) acknowledging that her bill, like current law, would allow abortions up to the point of delivery in cases when the mother\u2019s life or health was at serious risk. Northam, a pediatric neurologist, was asked about the issue in a radio interview and gave an answer that was later used by Republicans to suggest he favored killing live babies.\u201d \u00a0 DAYBOOK: Trump will meet with a group of manufacturers and sign an executive order.

(Julio Cortez\/AP) The Federal Trade Commission is supposed to be the U.S. government\u2019s top Internet privacy cop. But a new report raises questions about whether the agency has the resources and authority it needs to protect consumers.\u00a0 Data privacy controversies seem to make headlines at least weekly. But in the past decade, the FTC has filed just 101 enforcement actions regarding Internet privacy, according to a Government Accountability Office report published yesterday. While nearly all of the actions resulted in settlements that required companies to take action, in most cases the FTC didn\u2019t have the authority to issue fines, the watchdog said.\u00a0 The more than 100-year-old FTC is under pressure to modernize\u00a0to take greater action\u00a0against Silicon Valley -- and there's broad consensus that the agency should be the one to enforce whatever privacy law potentially\u00a0emerges in Washington.\u00a0 The GAO report may encourage lawmakers to further empower the FTC so its ready to take on this challenge as it considers how to move forward with a privacy law this year.\u00a0 The government watchdog directed Congress to consider what agency should oversee Internet privacy, what authorities that agency should have and how to balance privacy with industry\u2019s need to innovate.\u00a0This sets the stage for\u00a0two\u00a0hearings at the end of the month, when lawmakers in the House and Senate will examine policy principles for a federal data privacy framework.\u00a0 From Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), the House Energy and Commerce chairman who requested the report:\u00a0 Yet there's a complex debate to be had specifically about FTC authorities. The report found some stakeholders wanted to see the size of fines increase. Some critics\u00a0have said\u00a0they are not large enough to actually impact technology titans.\u00a0Another question raised in the report: Whether the\u00a0agency should have the power to issue fines against first-time privacy offenders. The FTC generally can\u2019t do that now. The exception is when the offense involves children because as the report mentions, the only comprehensive federal privacy law is the 25-year-old Children Online Privacy Protection Act. The few privacy fines it has levied against companies \u2014 such as the $22.5 million penalty against Google \u2014 came after the search giant violated a previous settlement with the FTC. That\u2019s also the case in the agency\u2019s high-profile probe against Facebook, in an investigation opened following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, when a data analytics\u00a0firm with ties to President Trump's campaign obtained Facebook users\u2019 data without their consent. The FTC is considering hitting Facebook with a record-setting fine for violating a 2011 agreement.\u00a0 The government watchdog interviewed a wide range of stakeholders in the privacy debate, including tech companies, industry groups, academics, consumer advocacy groups and former FTC and Federal Communications Commission officials. The interviewees were somewhat divided over how the FTC's authorities\u00a0should be expanded. \u201cSome stakeholders suggested that FTC\u2019s current ability to levy civil penalties could also be enhanced,\u201d the report said, Most of the former FTC commissioners said the agency should be able to levy fines for initial violations. Some of the stakeholders, particularly consumer advocacy groups, advocated for the agency to have broader rulemaking authority on data privacy and security issues.\u00a0 Industry representatives, however, warned regulations can stifle innovation and rulemakings can be lengthy. As CNET reporter Alfred Ng noted, the industry players that the watchdog interviewed want to maintain the status quo: The GAO's report follows legislative proposals for federal privacy law from several senators, including a bipartisan bill from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.). Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) introduced a bill last year that gained broad support among other Democrats. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) floated a proposal last year,\u00a0and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) introduced legislation earlier this year. Yesterday, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce published it's own draft legislation. But this year's privacy hearings are just getting started, and it's unclear which elements of these proposals will move forward.\u00a0 The privacy debate comes amid a broader discussion about the future of the FTC \u2014 which is also tasked with addressing the competition concerns the technology behemoths present. The FTC is\u00a0holding its own set of hearings about the future of competition and consumer protection, essentially trying to gather input on how the government should address these challenges in the digital age. The FTC was scheduled to have a hearing this week on privacy and data, but it was rescheduled for April.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere is a growing debate about the federal government\u2019s role in overseeing Internet privacy,\u201d the report said.\u00a0 A makeshift memorial outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 26, 2018.

Supporters of the system say it could identify risky behavior faster than people can. Yet Mahesh Saptharishi,\u00a0chief technology officer at Motorola Solutions, which bought\u00a0Avigilon last year, also said that the accuracy of the \u201cappearance search\u201d capability changes with lighting or the time of the year.\u00a0\u201cThe desire for technological solutions to the human problem of school violence has nevertheless emboldened a flood of tech and surveillance start-ups competing for public customers,\u201d Drew reported.

From Instagram: \u2014 More news about tech incidents and blunders: \u2014 Today in funding news: All the people who Trump says cry around him: A play-by-play of Kamala Harris admitting she smoked weed:","99":"A wave of liberal economic populism has caught a number of left-leaning billionaires and Wall Street executives off-guard, and they are scrambling to beat back tax and regulatory proposals that could have profound implications for the economy. So far, there have been only a few outspoken critics of the aggressive Democratic agenda, which has been led by lawmakers including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). But the tension, which has escalated rapidly in the past week, shows how business leaders are struggling to come to grips with a party that has lost many of its corporate-friendly voices. The Clinton and Obama administrations had strong ties to Wall Street and California technology leaders, but an emerging group of liberal leaders has rejected such relations. Leading the resistance, so far, are two potential 2020 presidential candidates, former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as former Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein. Each has spoken out in recent days about what they view as overly liberal proposals on taxation and regulation from prominent Democrats. All three have criticized President Trump but are warning that some proposals from Democrats risk pushing the country too far left and alienating broad swaths of voters. Their complaints have mostly been met with mockery and scorn from liberal lawmakers. \u201cIt should come as no surprise that a few billionaires want to continue to hoard as much wealth as possible, increasing their corrupting influence over our political system,\u201d said Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). \u201cThe reality is we cannot make progress on the greatest challenges of our time \u2014 whether climate change, student debt or health-care costs \u2014 unless we ask those with the most to give in our society to contribute more.\u201d The crux of many of the new proposals is an attempt to realign economic policy in a way that raises taxes on the wealthiest Americans and, in some cases, forces companies to share more income with their workers instead of with their shareholders. Democrats propose to spend some of that new revenue on programs they believe would help lower-income and middle-class Americans, such as by expanding government-run health care and assisting with college tuition. The White House has sought to seize on these proposals in recent days, alleging that Democrats are working to tilt the country into socialism. \u201cAmerica will never be a socialist country,\u201d Trump said during his State of the Union speech Tuesday. Technology executives and venture capitalist have also expressed increasing concern in the past few weeks about Democrats\u2019 denigration of business leaders, said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), whose district includes Silicon Valley. \u201cThey\u2019re open to higher marginal taxes and increasing the estate tax, which you may find counterintuitive. But they do say, \u2018Don\u2019t make us the villain,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Khanna said. \u201cThey\u2019re less concerned with their net worth than they are with their social status.\u201d Alice Rivlin, who was a top economic official during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, said Democrats risk overestimating the public\u2019s willingness to back some of their proposals and could create a backlash that costs them political support. \u201cI think the left is very energized right now, but I\u2019m worried about it, because the country is quite cautious and centrist,\u201d she said. So far, few of these new proposals have even universal support among Democrats, and small groups of lawmakers are testing their party to gauge support. Many of the ideas have emerged in the past few weeks. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a member of the House Budget Committee, said she is working with Ocasio-Cortez on revising Schakowsky\u2019s existing proposal to raise marginal tax rates and treat capital gains like ordinary income, and other tax changes. Schakowsky\u2019s bill would create a new top rate of 49\u00a0percent, but she said the enthusiasm for Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposal may lead the bill to include much higher rates. \u201cI am definitely buoyed by the fact the American people like the idea of much higher taxes for the very wealthy,\u201d Schakowsky said, stressing that talks with Ocasio-Cortez on the plan were preliminary. \u201cIt absolutely could be a big deal. .\u2009.\u2009. I think the atmosphere in which we\u2019re working has changed.\u201d Warren, who is running for president, has proposed a 2\u00a0percent annual tax on wealth above $50\u00a0million and a 3\u00a0percent annual tax on wealth above $1\u00a0billion. The United States has never had a federal wealth tax, and the proposal could face a court challenge on constitutional grounds if it were enacted. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is also expected to run for president, followed Warren by releasing a proposal to dramatically increase the estate tax; his plan includes a 77\u00a0percent rate on the portion of estates worth more than $1\u00a0billion. Sanders\u2019s plan would also move the threshold at which the estate tax kicks in from about $11\u00a0million to $3.5\u00a0million. And in a sign that the proposals have only begun, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) is working on a plan whose provisions include a financial transaction tax that could hit banks for each stock trade. Democrats have worked on similar proposals in the past, but Schatz aims to design his to impose much steeper costs on financial companies. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Sanders are working on a bill that would prohibit companies from buying back their own stock and potentially limit dividend payments unless the companies first pay workers higher wages and offer a range of employment benefits. At an event in New Hampshire last weekend, Bloomberg likened Warren\u2019s tax proposal to the type of policy that destroyed Venezuela\u2019s economy. \u201cWe need a healthy economy, and we shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed about our system,\u201d he told reporters. Schultz has called a number of the ideas from Democrats \u201cridiculous,\u201d and Blankfein wrote Tuesday on Twitter that the Schumer and Sanders proposal to limit stock buybacks was misguided. \u201cA company used to be encouraged to return money to shareholders when it couldn\u2019t reinvest in itself for a good return,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe money doesn\u2019t vanish, it gets reinvested in higher growth businesses that boost the economy and jobs. Is that bad?\u201d There has long been a tension between different factions of the Democratic Party, as some of its most outspoken members are close with Wall Street while others are sympathetic to the Occupy Wall Street movement. Democratic lawmakers have sought to bridge this divide by characterizing Republican economic policies as unfairly tilted toward corporations and the wealthy. This coexistence, though, is being put to the test even as policymakers fail to reverse income inequality. The richest 1\u00a0percent of Americans now control as much wealth as the bottom 95\u00a0percent, according to research by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two left-leaning economists at the University of California at Berkeley. Only five of 36 nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have higher levels of income inequality than the United States, according to the OECD\u2019s ranking. Meanwhile, the number of billionaires globally rose from 470 in 2000 to 2,208 in 2018, according to Forbes. Democrats are seizing on the issue of income inequality as they fight to design the party\u2019s economic agenda ahead of the 2020 elections. Jeffrey Sachs, a Columbia University economist, predicted that these proposals are likely to resonate with a broad swath of Americans who think both parties have done too little to help expand the middle class. \u201cI think the billionaires are not panicking so much as expressing their normal bravado that \u2018we just utter the words and this will be dismissed as a rant of the left,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s wrong, actually.\u201d And there are signs that some Wall Street executives are seeking out other prominent Democrats who might not support the types of tax and regulatory proposals that have emerged in recent weeks. Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, one of the world\u2019s largest asset management companies, recently met with former vice president Joe Biden, who is considering his own presidential run and in the past has urged more bipartisanship. A key component of Trump\u2019s appeal during the 2016 election was outreach to middle-class Americans, particularly in the Midwest, who felt economically left behind and stuck with stagnant wages. He floated ideas that would break up big banks, impose steep taxes on hedge fund advisers and rip up trade deals. He abandoned the bank proposal and ended up cutting taxes for wealthy Americans, but he has worked to rewrite trade relations with numerous countries, something that remains popular with his supporters. The economy has grown since Trump took office, and the unemployment rate has fallen, but a number of progressives think they can reframe the economic message ahead of next year\u2019s election in a way that puts a Democrat in the White House. \u201cWe respect the intellect of the public enough to trust them to understand what we have to say,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday. \u201cIt is through fighting for working-class issues, while educating the public, that we can win back a very wide base.\u201d This has forced a number of the party\u2019s wealthiest supporters to try to intervene, fearful that if they wait much longer, it could be too late. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get to 2020 and have some Democrat look you in the eye and say, \u2018Hey, you never said anything,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was a top campaign adviser to Republican John McCain in 2008. \u201cWhy are you complaining now?\u201d Correction: A previous version of this article mistated the Republican presidential campaign that economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin had advised. This version has been corrected.","100":"Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee will allow Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to answer questions in writing about his inaccurate financial report rather than face public questioning on the matter at an upcoming hearing. Democrats agreed to the billionaire\u2019s request about his 2018 financial disclosure form that a U.S. government watchdog said violated his ethics agreement, according to correspondence between the two parties obtained by The Washington Post.\u00a0 The Office of Government Ethics\u00a0ruled in mid-February that Ross had inaccurately reported stock holdings on his 2018 financial disclosure form, claiming he had sold them when he had not.\u00a0 Democrats on the panel asked Ross, one of Trump\u2019s wealthiest Cabinet officials, for more information about those inaccuracies in a February letter. But Ross responded that he was not ready to answer questions on the matter. Democrats may try anyway, but they\u2019ll allow him to submit responses for the record. \u201cIf you believe you are not prepared to answer questions related to your own financial disclosures, the committee will allow you to provide responsive information for the record, and I will make a statement to this effect at the hearing,\u201d Cummings wrote to Ross in a March 6 letter. Oversight Democrats, according to the letters, were also interested in asking Ross about a push by top Trump administration officials to\u00a0sell nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia over the objections of national security officials. Ross asked not to speak of that topic either. Ross also tried in recent days to postpone the Oversight hearing to April 9, according to the correspondence. But Oversight investigators responded that the hearing had been scheduled for months and that Ross had plenty of time. \u201cThe committee invited you to testify on January 8, 2019 \u2014 more than nine weeks ago \u2014 and you have had more than enough time to prepare,\u201d Cummings wrote to Ross, listing six different dates and separate conversations where Democrats say Ross\u2019s staff confirmed his appearance.\u00a0 The Commerce Department and a spokesman for the Oversight Committee declined to comment.\u00a0 House Democrats are expected to question Ross on Thursday about the Trump administration\u2019s decision to add a citizenship question on the 2020 census.\u00a0 Multiple cities and states have sued the administration, declaring the addition of the citizenship question unconstitutional. The Supreme Court decided last month to take up the issue. A lower federal court in California ruled against the citizenship question days ago. House Democrats worry the move is aimed at intimidating immigrants and will have a chilling effect on reporting, giving the census an inaccurate picture of population. Depressed response rates would likely affect Democratic-leaning areas and could mean fewer seats for the party in the House. Additionally, Democrats want to question Ross about why he originally blamed the Justice Department for the new census question. Court records, they say, suggest Ross personally coordinated on the matter with ex-Trump official Stephen K. Bannon, an immigration hard-liner.","101":"China and Russia are working together to challenge U.S. leadership in the world, undermine democratic governments and gain military and technological superiority over the United States, the nation\u2019s top intelligence official told a Senate panel Tuesday during a hearing that also underscored the distance between the U.S. intelligence community and President Trump on several critical fronts. The two U.S. adversaries \u201care more aligned than at any point since the mid-1950s,\u201d Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats said in his prepared remarks before the Senate Intelligence Committee, seemingly invoking the Cold War of the 20th century to warn lawmakers about the strategic risk posed by China and Russia. The countries have expanded cooperation in the energy sector over the past half decade; influenced international bodies that set rules and standards, particularly around communications technology; and will collaborate on the shared goal of \u201ctaking advantage of rising doubts in some places about the liberal democratic model,\u201d Coats warned. CIA Director Gina Haspel, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray and other top officials joined Coats in a discussion that covered a wide array of national security challenges, including cyber attacks that will aim to disrupt the 2020 presidential election and the continued threat posed by the Islamic State and other terrorist groups. Coats, speaking on behalf of the assembled officials, gave a global tour of national security challenges, focused mainly on Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. He said that North Korea was \u201cunlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capabilities,\u201d which the country\u2019s leaders consider \u201ccritical to the regime\u2019s survival.\u201d That assessment threw cold water on the White House\u2019s more optimistic view that the United States and North Korea will achieve a lasting peace and that the regime will ultimately give up its nuclear weapons. It was not the first time that U.S. intelligence has determined North Korea is not on the path to surrendering its weapons. And throughout the hearing, officials found themselves repeating earlier assessments on subjects that also were at odds with the president\u2019s public statements. The statement on North Korea drew extra attention coming ahead of a planned summit meeting next month between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Their first summit last year ended with a vague agreement that contained few concrete goals and deadlines. The distance between the intelligence community and the White House extended to areas that have ignited fierce political debates in Washington. None of the officials said there is a security crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, where Trump has considered declaring a national emergency so that he can build a wall. Coats noted that high crime rates and a weak job market are likely to spur migrants from Central America to cross into the United States. But he also sounded optimistic that Mexico will cooperate with the Trump administration to address violence and the flow of illegal drugs, problems that Trump has said Mexico isn\u2019t addressing sufficiently. Officials also warned that the Islamic State was capable of attacking the United States and painted a picture of a still-formidable organization. Trump has declared the group defeated and has said he wants to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria as a result. Coats noted that the terrorist group has suffered \u201csignificant leadership and territorial losses.\u201d But it still commands thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria, he said, and maintains eight branches, more than a dozen networks and attracts thousands of supporters around the world. The officials assessed that the government of Iran was not trying to build a nuclear weapon, despite the Trump administration\u2019s persistent claims that the country has been violating the terms of an international agreement forged during the Obama administration. Officials told lawmakers that Iran was in compliance with the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as some officials had previously said privately. But Iranian leaders are discussing reneging on the deal if they fail to reap the economic benefits it was supposed to bring after international sanctions were lifted, Haspel said. The Trump administration has reimposed U.S. sanctions. Intelligence officials largely sidestepped lawmakers\u2019 questions about why certain White House staffers were given security clearances after problems were discovered in their background checks that might ordinarily keep personnel from obtaining access to classified information. Officials also warned, as they did last year, about Russia\u2019s intention to interfere with the U.S. political system via \u201cinformation warfare\u201d waged largely on social media, which stokes social and political tensions to divide Americans. Other countries are likely to employ those tactics, as well, Coats said. \u201cWe expect our adversaries and strategic competitors to refine their capabilities and add new tactics as they learn from each other\u2019s experiences, suggesting the threat landscape could look very different in 2020 and future elections,\u201d the intelligence director said in his written statement. Trump continues to equivocate on whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election on his behalf, contradicting the unanimous assessment of all the top intelligence officials currently serving. At last year\u2019s threats hearing, leaders focused much of their remarks on Russia, unanimously concluding that the country was trying to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections by sowing discord and confusion via social media, as it had two years earlier in the U.S. presidential race. Last week, Coats emphasized in a national intelligence strategy document that U.S. spy agencies were turning their main focus away from fighting global terrorist networks toward countering Russia and other state adversaries seen as geopolitical threats to the United States. The United States will be challenged in coming years, the strategy concluded, by nations that exploit \u201cthe weakening of the post-WWII international order and dominance of Western democratic ideals\u201d and \u201cincreasingly isolationist tendencies in the West.\u201d In remarks last September, Haspel said the CIA would spy more aggressively on hostile governments. The CIA\u2019s spies and analysts will \u201cinvest more heavily in collection against the hardest issues,\u201d Haspel said. She didn\u2019t name specific countries, but the agency has set up new centers to collect intelligence on Iran and North Korea and has been focusing its assets on major powers, including Russia and China, according to intelligence officials.","102":"Ctrl + N The logo of the application TikTok in Paris on Dec. 14, 2018. (Joel Saget\/AFP\/Getty Images) Some Federal Trade Commission officials are calling the agency's fine against Musical.ly (now known as TikTok) for children\u2019s privacy violations a \u201cbig win.\u201d But critics say it highlights how Washington regulators aren\u2019t doing enough to keep kids safe online.\u00a0 The fine against the app \u2014 which lets people create lip-syncing music videos \u2014 is the largest the agency has\u00a0issued in a children\u2019s privacy case. That might sound like a steep punishment, but at $5.7 million, critics say it\u2019s actually a relatively paltry sum for a Silicon Valley darling that was acquired by the Bytedance (the Chinese maker of\u00a0TikTok) for close to $1 billion.\u00a0 That penalty\u00a0for illegally collecting data -- such as location information -- from\u00a0children under 13 must be higher to properly enforce\u00a0the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act,\u00a0according to Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass).\u00a0 \u201cWhile this fine may be a historic high for a COPPA violation, it is not high enough for the harm that is done to children and to deter violations of the law in the future by other companies,\u201d Markey said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cI urge the FTC to make COPPA enforcement a top priority and protect the privacy of a uniquely vulnerable class of Americans \u2014 our children. That means making companies pay higher monetary penalties that will actually incentive COPPA compliance.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 COPPA\u00a0was written in 1998, when dial-up ruled and apps that would allow children to upload videos from their phones were still about a decade\u00a0away. But the FTC fine against Musical.ly and the ensuing criticism could bring greater attention to the need to update children\u2019s privacy laws in Washington -- and ratchet up pressure on regulators to scrutinize if there are other companies that may be in violation of federal law. Privacy advocates say Musical.ly isn\u2019t the only company taking advantage of children online and that tougher enforcement and protections are needed.\u00a0 \u201cTikTok\u00a0and others have been failing to comply with COPPA for years, and the FTC has been reluctant to challenge the privacy invasive practices of the companies that target children,\u201d Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy, told my colleagues Craig Timberg and Tony Romm. \u201cThis is too little, too late.\u201d The Musical.ly case is a particularly glaring example of how children\u2019s privacy can be exploited online.\u00a0Musical.ly, the music video app TikTok merged with in 2018, has a long, well-documented history of attracting users under 13. In 2016, the New York Times reported that the app had many users in grade school, and it was using their location data to suggest people nearby follow them.\u00a0 Yesterday's fine was a rare instance where the FTC has been able to enforce COPPA on a general-interest app. COPPA provides broad privacy protections to children under the age of 13, prohibiting online services from collecting data about kids without their parents permission. But as Craig and Tony pointed out, the law only applies to services that have \u201cactual knowledge\u201d that the users are underage or services that are specifically directed at children.\u00a0 In the Musical.ly case, the FTC was able to show that many of the children using the app had their true ages written in their profiles, and Musical.ly still did nothing to limit their access to the app.\u00a0 \u201cThe operators of Musical.ly \u2014 now known as TikTok \u2014 knew many children were using the app but they still failed to seek parental consent before collecting names, email addresses, and other personal information from users under the age of 13,\u201d FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a news release. \u201cThis record penalty should be a reminder to all online services and websites that target children.\u201d The TikTok case could give the agency the precedent to probe other general-interest apps causing concern among children\u2019s privacy advocates, such as Google's YouTube\u00a0or the video game Fortnite.\u00a0\u00a0 The agency has already received a complaint about Google\u2019s YouTube. Over 20 advocacy groups filed a complaint last year that said YouTube is violating the law because it is collecting data about children\u00a0watching videos on the service without getting permission from parents. They say YouTube knows of this because of the high-number of child-directed channels on the service. The FTC wouldn\u2019t tell my colleagues yesterday whether it was actively investigating YouTube.\u00a0 Common Sense Media, one of the groups that filed the complaint against YouTube, weighed in: \u201cIt is no secret that tech companies are illegally and knowingly collecting personal information from children,\u201d Jim Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, said in a statement to my colleagues. \u201cMusical.ly wasn\u2019t the first company and they won\u2019t be the last, which is why we need the FTC to continue to regularly enforce the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act and hold companies accountable in a big way.\u201d TikTok promised to require new users to verify their age. It also launched a separate app for people under the age of 13 that complies with U.S. privacy laws and will delete all data about children it previously collected.\u00a0 \u201cWe care deeply about the safety and privacy of our users,\u201d TikTok said in a blog post. \u201cThis is an ongoing commitment, and we are continuing to expand and evolve our protective measures in support of this.\u201d BITS: Uber and Lyft are planning to give some of the most active or longest serving drivers money to buy stocks in their upcoming initial public offerings,\u00a0the Wall Street Journal's Maureen Farrell reports. The companies are planning to give drivers a cash reward that can be applied toward stock. \u201cIt is typically hard for an ordinary investor to buy a company\u2019s stock at its IPO price before it begins trading on an exchange, so this move would give drivers access they likely wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise,\u201d Farrell writes.\u00a0 Uber, which has 3 million drivers globally, plans to give a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of its drivers around the world a cash bonus or stock, based on a sliding scale determined by length of service or number of trips. Uber has long tried to provide drivers with company shares, but \u201chad encountered a roadblock because of securities laws that make it challenging to give private shares to independent contractors,\u201d Farrell wrote.\u00a0 Lyft will give drivers that have given at least 10,000 rides $1,000 in cash that can be applied to IPO shares.\u00a0 Sen.

Almost all Republicans\u00a0on the panel supported the idea that federal privacy\u00a0legislation should replace state laws to prevent differing\u00a0rules between states.

Despite tougher laws enacted last year, smokers can light up in some restaurants and bars. Tobacco advertising is allowed on television, cigarette packages don\u2019t contain graphic health warnings, and tobacco is cheap compared to other major cities. However, don\u2019t expect to puff away at next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics. Organizers on Thursday announced a stringent ban on all tobacco products and vaping devices. Smoking will be banned at any indoor or outdoor Olympic or Paralympic venue, including perimeter areas being run by the Tokyo games. Organizers say the prohibition it tougher than regulations for the last two Summer Olympics in London and Rio de Janeiro. \u201cTokyo 2020 aims to leave a legacy of improved health for the county at large,\u201d organizers said in a statement. Japan\u2019s national legislature last year approved a ban on smoking inside public facilities, but the measure is seen a weak and excludes many bars and restaurants. Tokyo\u2019s city government separately enacted tougher rules last year to protect from second-hand smoke. All provisions kick in during the run-up to the Olympics. Smoking in still allowed in small eateries and bars. They make up half of Japanese establishments, where it\u2019s common to see a customer eating with chopsticks in one hand with a cigarette in the other. \u201cCountering passive smoking has long been a concern,\u201d Keiko Nakayama, a Tokyo city government health official, said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cWe would like to push for approving more anti-smoking measures so people stay healthy longer.\u201d The statement said the city\u2019s smoking policy would be reviewed in five years. But more regulation will always face tough opposition despite the fact that smoking has declined in recent years. The Japanese government has a large stake in tobacco. It owns a third of the stock and is the top investor in major cigarette company Japan Tobacco Inc. The industry was a government monopoly until 1985, and is a huge source of tax revenue. Smoking is cheap in Japan compared to other developed countries. A pack of Marlboro cigarettes costs about $5. In London and New York it\u2019s about $14, and in Sydney it\u2019s $20. According to World Health Organization data for 2015, 32.7 percent of Japanese males smoke, compared to 24.4 in the United States. The highest figures were East Timor (78.0) and Indonesia (74.9), and the lowest two were in Africa: Ethiopia (7.6) and Ghana (7.1). ___ ___","104":"Technology stocks led the U.S. market\u2019s rebound from its worst weekly decline of the year as investors grew more certain that central bankers around the world are doing enough to support global growth and data indicated the American economy remains on solid footing.

All Washington had to do was win its final 26 games. \u201cI said if we win out, we can get to 50,\u201d Leonsis said in an interview the following day. The Wizards lost that night at Detroit to clinch their 40th straight season \u2014 and 16th under Grunfeld \u2014 without reaching 50 wins. Every other NBA franchise has won 50 games at least once since Washington last accomplished the feat in 1979. Leonsis shared the story about his email to Grunfeld in a 45-minute interview earlier this month with WUSA9 contributor and former Washington Post columnist Mike Wise. He acknowledged the Wizards fan base\u2019s frustration with the direction of the franchise under Grunfeld, who was hired in 2003. \u201cI think that\u2019s unfortunate, but I think the fans are appropriately upset with us because we didn\u2019t meet any of our goals,\u201d Leonsis said. Leonsis was noncommittal when asked whether Grunfeld would remain in charge beyond this year. \u201cWell, let\u2019s see how the season turns out,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery year you articulate what your goals are.\" Leonsis has articulated the Wizards\u2019 goals, beyond winning 50 games, and what the consequences of not meeting them might be in recent weeks. \u201cWe set out goals, and you got to meet the goals,\u201d Leonsis told reporters ahead of Washington\u2019s game in London last month. \u201cAnd the first goal is to make it into the playoffs and to do better than we did last year, and to me that will make for a successful year.\" \u201cI\u2019m happy if we meet our goals,\u201d Leonsis told WTOP\u2019s Bruce Alan two weeks later. \u201cIf we don\u2019t meet our goals, we have to sit down and take stock on what do we have to do to improve during the offseason.\u201d The Wizards have lost four straight since Leonsis sent his 50-win email to Grunfeld and are four games back of the Hornets for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference with 22 games remaining. Basketball Reference gives Washington a 2.5 percent chance to make the postseason, while FiveThirtyEight provides a somewhat rosier 6 percent outlook. With or without a surprise playoff push, the Wizards face a summer of uncertainty. John Wall is expected to miss most or all of next season after rupturing his left Achilles\u2019 tendon last month. Tomas Satoransky, Thomas Bryant and Bobby Portis are due to become restricted free agents. Portis and Jabari Parker were acquired for Otto Porter Jr. in a trade deadline deal with Chicago that came days after Leonsis told WTOP the Wizards wouldn\u2019t trade Porter, Wall or Bradley Beal this year. \u201cI feel terrible because I read the other day that Otto felt that we had lied to him, and I understand that,\u201d Leonsis told Wise. \u201cWe did tell him we weren\u2019t going to trade him.

On Monday, President Trump unveiled a budget request that would deliver a first installment of cash for his plan to end the spread of HIV, focused in part on rural areas such as Mississippi, where a tangle of stigma, poverty, inadequate access to health care and lingering racial bias results in a disproportionately large share of HIV infections. But the proposal faces an uncertain fate in Congress \u2014 and comes as part of a budget request that, if enacted, would also make deep cuts to the country\u2019s major health-care program for the poor, on which many people with HIV depend. The virus is now concentrated in a very small number of places in the United States: the rural parts of seven states, including Mississippi; the District of Columbia; Puerto Rico and 48 hot-spot counties scattered across the country. If HIV transmission can be quelled there, the president\u2019s goal is within reach, public health officials said. \u201cWe are really at a unique moment in time now,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said. \u201cWe have got the right data, the right tools and the right leadership to achieve this historic milestone in public health.\u201d The administration\u2019s goal is to reduce HIV transmission by 75\u00a0percent within five years and by at least 90\u00a0percent by 2030, which would prevent 250,000 infections. That depends largely on getting vulnerable people on two kinds of medication: antiretroviral therapy for those already infected \u2014 which can drive viral loads so low that they cannot transmit the virus \u2014 and pre-exposure prophylactic medication, better known as PrEP or Truvada, for those at risk. The drug is more than 90\u00a0percent effective at preventing HIV infection via sex and more than 70\u00a0percent effective in blocking it in injection drug use. \u201cTheoretically, you could end the epidemic tomorrow if you did that,\u201d said Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the architects of the plan. But the obstacles are formidable. Southern states accounted for 52\u00a0percent of the 38,739 HIV diagnoses in 2017, far more than any other region, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (The annual number of new infections nationally has remained stable since 2013, according to the CDC.) The Food and Drug Administration approved Truvada in 2012, but a 2015 survey of primary-care doctors showed that a third of them had not heard of it, according to the CDC. The health agency estimates that 1.1\u00a0million people should be on PrEP but that only 90,000 were taking it in 2016. Use of the drug is climbing nationally, but the South still lags far behind. When researchers at Emory University\u2019s Rollins School of Public Health calculated a ratio of PrEP use to need for the drug in 2017, they found it was more than three times higher in the northeastern United States than in the South. Persuading many more people to take the drugs will require more federal money for health clinics as well as for education and outreach to certain groups, especially black men who have sex with other men. At current rates, half that group will be diagnosed with HIV infection. \u201cA large part of this is the will to actually stop the HIV epidemic,\u201d Azar said. In Jackson, which has the fourth-highest rate of HIV infection among U.S. cities, Open Arms tries to recruit men for PrEP from places including clinics where sexually transmitted diseases are treated. More than three-quarters of those men express interest, but fewer than 20\u00a0percent actually show up for appointments, according to research by Leandro A. Mena, Open Arms\u2019s medical director. After three months, only 9\u00a0percent of the original group is on the drug, he said. \u201cThe path to PrEP is full of little bumps,\u201d Mena said. \u201cAnd each little bump is an opportunity to drop off PrEP. My job is to smooth the road.\u201d In small, rural towns, one of the problems is hesi\u00adta\u00adtion to seek the drug because of the stigma of having a same-sex partner, sometimes coupled with racial bias, experts said. Both keep people from seeking care. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a small town, it may be that at that primary care provider, one of your cousins or one of your aunties may be working in that practice,\u201d said Patrick Sullivan, a professor of epidemiology at Emory University in Atlanta and one of the authors of the PrEP-to-need study, which appeared in the journal Annals of Epidemiology. Poorer, rural communities also have significantly less access to health care. Mississippi regularly ranks among the poorest states in the nation, and the poor have the most difficulty sticking with health-care providers\u2019 instructions and taking medications regularly. Jon\u2019Aric Nathaniel, another Open Arms client, is in the difficult-to-serve group. He has no address in Jackson, although he spends much of his time here. He crashes at friends\u2019 homes, selling marijuana and styling hair to bring in some cash. He has been in jail more times than he can remember, mostly for street fights. The 29-year-old takes a wide variety of drugs for anxiety, bipolar disorder and high blood pressure. He also self-medicates, swigging from a Crown Royal bottle much of the day and night. He was on PrEP for perhaps two years a while back, he said, and would like to stay on it. But with so many other problems, he finds it hard to stick with the daily regimen. When his father developed prostate cancer, Nathaniel found himself on the road to and from Louisiana and fell out of the routine, he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t having sex,\u201d he said, \u201cand in my life, there was so much I was going through.\u201d He mostly keeps to himself, he said, because it is safer than being promiscuous. But \u201csometimes I let the devil come for me, and sometimes I let him win.\u201d Among Open Arms clients, Mena said, 55\u00a0percent of the people who start on PrEP are uninsured, and 20\u00a0percent of men under 30 who seek care miss a meal once a week because they have no money. The health clinic also runs a food pantry for anyone in need. \u201cWe know that for them to adhere to their treatment, we need to know what they need,\u201d said Sandra Melvin, the health center\u2019s chief operating officer. Rowland, 42, lives in Inverness, a farming town of about 1,000 on the western side of the state. He said he heard about Truvada in 2014 and brought it up with his doctor. The physician hadn\u2019t heard of it but after some research advised him to begin taking the medication. He recommended Open Arms, where Rowland could receive comprehensive health services as well as help paying for the drug. Truvada sells for more than $1,600 a month. Until recently, it was not covered by all insurance companies and sometimes carried large co-payments. That changed in November, when the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that all people at high risk of contracting HIV should be on the medication. When the recommendation becomes final, insurance companies will have to cover the drug without co-payments. Rowland said he could never afford the drug. A program offered by its manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, covers all his costs. The periodic paperwork is a hassle, but at Open Arms his case manager, Isa Wrenn-Jones, helps him file it. \u201cWithout Isa, I would not be on PrEP,\u201d he said. Rowland could buy the drug at a pharmacy about 15 miles south of his home, in the town of Belzoni. But that pharmacy does not stock it, so he would have to order it at least a day in advance. \u201cThey\u2019re tight-lipped. They\u2019re discreet. They\u2019re very professional,\u201d he said. But it\u2019s easier to take care of everything at Open Arms. During a visit in January, he answered intimate questions about his sexual practices posed by nurse Kayla Parker-Logan, assuring her that he takes his medication every day, almost always uses condoms and asks his partners about their HIV status. \u201cSome people like tennis, golf. I like sex,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you do adult things, you have to accept adult responsibilities. You have to be responsible to yourself and to the person you\u2019re having sex with.\u201d Such conversations are less common in other settings, where health-care providers may be reluctant to discuss their patients\u2019 sex lives with them. \u201cToo many providers are not even willing to have conversations with their patients about PrEP,\u201d said Jesse Milan Jr., president and chief executive of the advocacy group AIDS United. \u201cMany public-health officials are very concerned that private physicians are getting off too easy around sexual health with their patients.\u201d The Trump administration\u2019s HIV initiative will have to find ways to overcome all of these obstacles, until the message to adopt PrEP becomes as ubiquitous as the advice to practice safe sex, health authorities said. \u201cNow that we have this highly efficacious prevention mechanism, it\u2019s about bringing it to scale,\u201d said Aaron Siegler, an associate professor at Emory\u2019s public-health school.","107":"Inside a covered market that cuts between peeling monoliths of public housing, middle-aged men gathered at a cafe on a late afternoon to play cards and sip steaming vials of mint tea. A good number were immigrants, most of Kurdish or Turkish heritage. And they identified with many of the grievances of France\u2019s yellow vest protesters. Transportation is also an issue here, the men noted. Although a new system is in the works, there\u2019s still no direct commuter rail link from this Paris suburb to the city center, less than 10 miles away. And economic insecurity is \u00adever-present. Unemployment is high. Many jobs pay only minimum wage, and supporting a family can be a struggle. \u201cThe yellow vests? They are right,\u201d said Recep Salmas, 54, a chauffeur who arrived in France from Turkey as a toddler and has lived in Clichy-sous-Bois since 1975. But Salmas hadn\u2019t converged with the masses protesting on the Champs-Elysees. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die with a police bullet in my head,\u201d he said. Mohamed Isaoui, 18, was waiting for a ride near the market. He said that he recently dropped out of school to take a minimum-wage job at a factory and that he, too, supported the yellow vests. \u201cThey are right to protest,\u201d Isaoui said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t bring myself to join them,\u201d he added. Three months into the protests, the movement that has rocked French politics has remained largely rural, and largely white. The demands for greater economic equality and more attention for \u201cforgotten France\u201d have given scant attention to the economically distressed suburbs outside France\u2019s major cities. The yellow vests are quick to say that their grievances have nothing to do with identity \u2014 and certainly not whiteness. Their high-visibility vests are the ones all French motorists are required to keep in their vehicles. But people in predominantly minority communities like this one say they don\u2019t feel this is their fight. In Clichy, at least, the reticence is linked to one of the last times France was convulsed by massive protests. In October 2005, two teenage boys in Clichy \u2014 one black, one Arab \u2014 came upon a police van on their way home from playing soccer. The boys ran, the police chased them. The boys \u2014 Zyed Benna and Bouna Traor\u00e9, known since as \u201cZyed and Bouna\u201d \u2014 ended up hiding in an electrical power substation, where they were electrocuted. Their deaths sparked weeks of riots and civil unrest in public housing complexes across France. Protesters declared they were fed up with police brutality, racial discrimination and the perceived indifference of the French government. Burning cars and broken glass led to a national state of emergency. \u201cEvery day, there was fire,\u201d said Salmas, the chauffeur. He shook his head as he recalled the autumn of 2005. \u201cIt was catastrophic.\u201d The riots had political consequences, but not the sort Clichy residents might have hoped for. The backlash helped propel hard-line conservative Nicolas Sarkozy to the presidency in 2007. Sarkozy had been interior minister in 2005 and made a name for himself hurling epithets at demonstrators on national television. \u201cWe\u2019re going to blast this place clean with a water hose,\u201d he said with tough-guy swagger. No one has said the same of the yellow vests, who have protested for far longer, disrupted economic activity and vandalized beloved national monuments. Some within their ranks have physically attacked journalists, issued death threats against government officials and vowed to storm the Elysee Palace. A group recently swarmed around Alain Finkielkraut, a prominent Jewish intellectual, as he walked home on a Saturday afternoon. \u201cGo back to Tel Aviv,\u201d they said. But the French government\u2019s response has been to launch a two-month talking tour to take better stock of the anger behind the protests. President Emmanuel Macron has made concessions \u2014 postponing a planned fuel tax increase and raising the minimum wage. And, in a mid-December address, he apologized. \u201cI also know that I happened to hurt some of you with my words,\u201d he said. Clichy residents note that in 2005, there was no apology, nothing that resembled Macron\u2019s \u201cgrand d\u00e9bat\u201d or any attempt to understand. \u201cThe riots began with the death of two children, which was traumatic and entirely unacceptable,\u201d said Clichy Mayor Olivier Klein. \u201cThe authorities didn\u2019t provide the words of compassion that were needed, or take responsibility for their actions.\u201d Instead, protesters were silenced, sometimes with force. The lesson of 2005 was clear, Salmas said. \u201cThe police don\u2019t protect you \u2014 they protect themselves against you.\u201d \u201cSince 2005, people have closed their mouths,\u201d Salmas said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the right to say anything.\u201d Macron has tried to take his \u201cgrand d\u00e9bat\u201d on inequality into the suburbs, hosting a town hall at Evry-Courcouronnes this month. He met with some 300 elected officials and local association leaders there. He also visited a job assistance agency, giving a nod to the issue of high unemployment in suburban communities. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen all the young people who are around the table to prepare for their internship and their job tomorrow,\u201d Macron told reporters. \u201cThey are the best ambassadors of our plan in the city.\u201d On the whole, the town halls across France have been quite popular \u2014 even if primarily as an opportunity to launch vitriol at the French president for hours. But the suburban events that didn\u2019t feature a presidential visit have struggled to draw crowds anywhere near as large, especially among ordinary residents. Klein, the Clichy mayor, noted that the loudest of the yellow vest protesters seem to be experiencing \u201cd\u00e9classement,\u201d a loss of \u00admiddle-class status. In communities like his, however, that status has always been elusive. \u201cI have the impression that there\u2019s a form of resilience here,\u201d he said, \u201ca form of solidarity and fraternity that\u2019s perhaps stronger than in the periurban areas.\u201d Rokhaya Diallo, a French television host and activist for racial equality, was less positive in her assessment. \u201cI think that people are hopeless, and they don\u2019t feel that their concerns will be heard in any way,\u201d she said. In France, a country that does not officially recognize race or religion, the white citizen is also still considered the default, Diallo said. \u201cWhiteness is not seen as an identity in France,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s neutral.\u201d Because of this perception, few question the claim among yellow vests that they are entitled to speak for \u201cthe people.\u201d \u201cWe still live in that illusion of universalism, but it\u2019s just a myth,\u201d Diallo said. Some French minorities fear they would be treated more harshly than white protesters by police. Ten deaths have been linked to the yellow vest protests, but most of those have been the result of traffic accidents related to blockades. This month, the European Parliament condemned French authorities for using \u201cflash ball\u201d projectiles, a weapon that has maimed protesters, including J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rodrigues, one of the movement\u2019s prominent figures. But so far, no yellow vests have died at the hands of police. Yet minorities sometimes do. And so some Clichy residents are reluctant to put themselves at risk \u2014 especially when, once again, they may not see any political progress. Isaoui was only a toddler during the 2005 riots, though they left an impression. \u201cI was small, but I remember a little,\u201d Isaoui said. \u201cPeople have told me. It\u2019s always like that, conflicts between us and the police.\u201d","108":"As amorous embraces go, few could be more ardent than the one Beto O\u2019Rourke got this month from Vanity Fair magazine. The perfectly timed cover treatment was the full monty: Rugged-glam photo by the legendary Annie Leibovitz, the former Texas congressman\u2019s earnest Kennedy-esque gaze, and the ripe-for-parody headline including this immortal quote: \u201cI\u2019m just born to be in it.\u201d Most Americans wouldn\u2019t see the magazine itself, of course, but the rest of the news media \u2014 including network evening news \u2014 helped spread the image around as they gave over-the-top coverage to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s kickoff. Does soft-focus treatment like this help a candidate\u2019s cause? It sure doesn\u2019t hurt. His campaign raised more than $6\u00a0million its first day, edging out Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s (Vt.) impressive one-day fundraising a few weeks earlier. A few days later, the website PredictIt (\u201cthe stock market for politics\u201d) listed as its top three presidential contenders: former vice president Joe Biden (who hasn\u2019t even declared yet), Sanders and O\u2019Rourke. Somehow, despite a remarkably diverse Democratic field \u2014 which includes a record number of women, a gay man and several people of color \u2014 the B-Boys (that is, Beto, Biden and Bernie) \u2014 were off and running. The news media undoubtedly was part of the equation. With more than 18 months to go before the 2020 election, the love and attention was not being dished out in equal measure. As author Rebecca Traister described it, she woke up one morning this week thinking about the flawed notion that being a white man is actually a disadvantage, given this diverse field. The reality is quite the opposite, she wrote on Twitter: \u201cEarly metrics would show it to be an extremely powerful polling & fundraising boon, as it has always, always been.\u201d Author Linda Hirshman told me how frustrated she felt this week after watching \u201cbrilliant\u201d town-hall appearances featuring Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.). The candidates offered detailed policy proposals and came off as smart and appealing. \u201cBut I woke up to still more media fixation on Beto,\u201d she said. (Warren did capture some prominent headlines for saying she\u2019d like to see the end of the electoral college in favor of a system where \u201cevery vote matters.\u201d) The reason for this, Hirshman posits, is the almost cartoonish way in which the national media depicts candidates: as characters in a drama. \u201cThe national media is most interested in telling stories, in an almost novelistic way,\u201d said Hirshman, whose book \u201cReckoning: The Epic Battle Against Sexual Abuse and Harassment\u201d will be published in June. This gives candidates like the B-Boys a \u201cstructural advantage,\u201d she said. Traditional fiction, after all, likes to depict a woman in peril and the caped male avenger swooping in to save the day. While local news media tend to focus on policy that would affect their communities, national media look for \u2014 and endlessly repeat \u2014 the broad-brush caricature: Gillibrand is the mean woman who unfairly took down Al Franken; O\u2019Rourke is \u201ctall and cute\u201d and wants to heal a divided country. Robert Leonard, news director of two Iowa radio stations, told me in an email exchange that he\u2019s been impressed by the enthusiastic welcome that candidates including Gillibrand, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) are getting in his state. \u201cI think the women have lots of traction \u2014 especially Warren and Harris,\u201d Leonard said. He described the Massachusetts senator as \u201celectric,\u201d attracting a huge crowd and exuding personal warmth. (A far cry from the fretting about whether she is likable enough.) \u201cPeople love Cory Booker, too.\u201d Having talked to Iowa supporters of every candidate in the race (and some who aren\u2019t yet), Leonard sees the contest as wide open and offers this caution: \u201cPoll numbers that show Biden and Sanders up top only tell us about the past, not the future.\u201d But, one might argue, doesn\u2019t it make good sense to give the most coverage to those candidates who seem to have the most early support? Well, that depends on what the coverage aim is. Is it the \u201chorse-race\u201d model that attempts to say who\u2019s ahead and who will ultimately win the nomination and the presidency? You might recall from 2016 that \u2014 despite all the honing of this skill \u2014 prognostication is not the media\u2019s forte. Or is it a citizens-first model that attempts to inform the electorate so they can make the best decisions? The horse-race model seems, as usual, to be out ahead by more than a few furlongs. And so, we hear a lot about the B-Boys. In polling, in fundraising, in media ardor, they begin to seem inevitable. Invincible. It\u2019s early, of course. And these patterns may well change. But right now, these three almost seem to have the whole thing sewn up. And, when many Democratic voters put sheer electability (unseating President Trump) as the top priority, this media-driven momentum takes on even more power. That\u2019s potentially dangerous. It would be a shame \u2014 and counterproductive \u2014 if premature judgments end up transforming all this diversity and talent into a shrugged-off bunch of also-rans.","109":"INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Many headliners boosted their draft stock at the NFL\u2019s annual scouting combine with a wonderful workout, a dazzling 40-yard dash, a brilliant bench press or, in Kyler Murray\u2019s case, just standing up straight. Mississippi State edge rusher Montez Sweat and Ole Miss wide receiver D.K. Metcalf were the big winners along with Murray , but others saw eyebrows raised and their value lowered after costly injuries, bad interviews or pedestrian performances. They\u2019ll have to do better in their pro days and private workouts ahead of the draft in late April. One of the biggest disappointments was potential first-round pick Jachai Polite, an outside linebacker from Florida who put up unimpressive numbers in the 40 (4.84 seconds) and vertical jump (32 inches) before ending his workout Sunday with a sore hamstring. Clemson\u2019s hulking defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence strained his left thigh running the 40 and sat out the remaining drills, disappointing scouts eager to see how the 350-pounder performed after missing the College Football Playoff because of a positive test for a performance-enhancing drug. Lawrence\u2019s college teammate, linebacker Tre Lamar, hurt his right shoulder on the bench press, and highly touted LSU cornerback Greedy Williams didn\u2019t compete Monday after suffering cramps. The most serious injury came Sunday when Ohio State cornerback Kendall Sheffield tore a chest muscle while heaving 225 pounds in the bench press drill. A torn pectoral typically requires surgery and a year\u2019s recovery. More disconcerting to teams are the players who can\u2019t use injury as an excuse. That group this year included: \u2014Mississippi left tackle Greg Little. He labored through the on-field drills and posted poor numbers in the 40 (5.33) and vertical jump (25 inches). Those were among the worst for O-linemen and he skipped the bench press altogether. \u2014Florida Atlantic running back Devin Singletary. The Owls\u2019 5-foot-7, 203-pound playmaker piled up 3,300 yards and 54 touchdowns the last two seasons. But his hopes of shedding concerns about the level of competition he faced took a hit with a disappointing 4.66-second 40-yard dash. \u2014Georgia running back Elijah Holyfield. His status as one of the few standouts in a rather weak running backs class took a hit when he was clocked in the 40 in 4.78 seconds, slower than the trio of punters and kickers who ran the 40 at the combine. Among running backs, only Wisconsin\u2019s Alec Ingold ran slower than Holyfield. \u2014Georgia wide receiver Riley Ridley. He posted poor numbers in the 40 \u2014 4.58 seconds \u2014 and the vertical jump \u2014 30\u00bd inches, which was second worst among wide receivers. Only Fresno State\u2019s KeeSean Johnson at 30 inches was worse. \u2014Texas WR Lil\u2019Jordan Humphrey. Scouts were left wondering if he could win 1-on-1 matchups after he posted a 4.75-second 40, the slowest among wide receivers at the combine. Now that the combine is over, prospects can turn their attention to pro days and private team workouts \u2014 and not just the guys who had bad combines who are trying to impress. Murray didn\u2019t throw or run in Indianapolis. All he did after getting measured at 5-foot-10 and 207 pounds was meet with teams. He said he\u2019ll throw and run at Oklahoma\u2019s pro day. Despite not breaking a sweat in Indy, Murray\u2019s measurements placated concerns he was way too short and small to survive in the NFL. Now, all the buzz is about how he might even follow former Oklahoma teammate Baker Mayfield as the top overall draft pick. \u201cI\u2019m going to be happy wherever I go,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAt the end of this, it\u2019s an opportunity to go play football.\u201d ___ ___","110":"Editors\u2019 note: This story failed to adequately attribute research on the impact of dollar stores on grocery stores in the Tulsa area to a 2018 report by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. The article has been updated. \u201cThe community said, \u2018We don\u2019t want any more dollar stores,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. \u201cWe need grocery stores, clothing, shoes \u2014 things that you need to live.\u201d Tulsa is one of several cities grappling with uncomfortable questions from the rise of dollar stores in urban America. These stores have gained attention as success stories in the country\u2019s most economically distressed places \u2014 largely rural counties with few retail options. Two main chains, Dollar General and Dollar Tree (which owns Family Dollar), operate more than 30,000 stores nationally and plan to open thousands more, vastly outnumbering Walmarts and other retailers. In cities, dollar stores trade in economic despair, with many residents saying they are a vital source of cheap staples. But as the stores cluster in low-income neighborhoods, some residents worry the stores deter other business, especially in neighborhoods without grocers or options for healthful food. The Institute for Self-Reliance, a nonprofit advocacy group, argued in a December report exploring the effect of dollar stores in Tulsa that \u201cthere\u2019s growing evidence that these stores are not merely a byproduct of economic distress. They\u2019re a cause of it.\u201d Dollar stores rarely sell fresh produce or meats, but they can undercut grocery stores on prices of everyday items, often pushing them out of business. In Tulsa and elsewhere, the questions are whether dollar stores are the last retail option for low-income America \u2014 and whether restrictions like Hall-Harper\u2019s can make a difference. The companies say their target customers depend on them for items as basic as toilet paper, especially in areas where no other retailers will venture. \u201cThe Dollar General customer is in a permanent recession, and we want to help them,\u201d its former chief executive Cal Turner Jr. said last year on Fox Business. More than a century ago, a stretch of North Tulsa was dubbed \u201cBlack Wall Street\u201d for its booming black-owned businesses. Much of that prosperity was wiped out during one of the worst episodes of racial violence in American history. In May 1921, a white mob set fire to hundreds of businesses and homes, killing as many as 300 people and scorching 40 blocks. Many residents say the divide created by that massacre continues to this day. Development has largely shifted southward, including the wealthiest neighborhoods and ritziest shopping districts. With fewer options for fresh food and health care, people in a North Tulsa Zip code have an average life expectancy of 11 years less than those in South Tulsa, according to a 2015 city report. Hall-Harper has made North Tulsa\u2019s lack of fresh food a priority. She was elected in 2016 in District\u00a01 \u2014 where she grew up and lives with her police officer husband and teenage daughter. Hall-Harper said she\u2019s not against the dollar store altogether. But their unstoppable rise, she said, keeps grocers from opening. Supermarkets in the area have consistently failed, and there are few smaller bodegas or markets. Tulsa\u2019s nine council districts average six dollar stores apiece. But in District 1, where there are nine, residents are at a double disadvantage. \u201cOther communities have access to quality grocery stores,\u201d Hall-Harper said. \u201cMine is the only one that does not.\u201d Hall-Harper said the disparity is also racial. According to a citywide 2018 Gallup poll, nearly three times the percentage of black residents \u2014 46 percent \u2014 say they have trouble finding stores that sell fresh food, compared with whites and Hispanics. In 2017, Hall-Harper advocated for a six-month moratorium on new dollar stores in parts of District 1, which the council approved. In April, she led the call to restrict the stores, which also passed. Any new store within certain areas of District 1 can\u2019t be within a mile of an existing one. But even among those who see a need for more fresh food, not everyone agrees that targeting dollar stores is the right tactic. Jack Henderson, who represented District 1 on the council before Hall-Harper, said dollar stores are crucial. The last Dollar General to open is across the street from a senior citizens home. That store, Henderson said, is a lifeline to residents. The restrictions mean that other businesses \u201cwould think, \u2018hey, if they don\u2019t want them, they probably don\u2019t want us either,\u201d he said. Henderson worries that District 1 will take on the reputation of being hostile to new business. The city\u2019s newspaper, the Tulsa World, argued the same in an editorial, saying: \u201cThe moratorium suggests the council thinks it\u2019s appropriate for city government to pick winners and losers in the economy. It isn\u2019t.\u201d Most Dollar Generals don\u2019t sell produce. But in response to rising criticism it added fruit and vegetables to the store across from the senior home \u2014 grapes, apples, avocados, potatoes sandwiched between bags of fried pork skins and cases of Michelob Ultra. Dollar stores are a staple in rural America. While Walmarts and other supercenters attract shoppers from miles beyond a small town, Dollar stores fill the gaps in between. Dollar Tree bought Family Dollar in 2015. Together, the chains operate more than 15,100 stores across the United States and Canada. It plans to hit 26,000 stores. Dollar General operates more than 15,200 stores. Seventy percent of the company\u2019s existing stores are in communities with 20,000 people or less. In 2017, the company notched its 28th consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth. And it is expanding rapidly. In 2009, Dollar General opened 500 stores. In 2017, it hit 1,315 new stores. In the past year, Dollar General\u2019s stock price is up 22 percent. Dollar Tree\u2019s slumped 7 percent. Some argue the dollar stores aren\u2019t a response to chronic poverty, but an instigator. \u201cIt creates an overall sense of the neighborhood being run-down,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell, the co director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. \u201cIt\u2019s a recipe for locking in poverty rather than alleviating it.\u201d Grocery stores run on thin profit margins \u2014 usually between 1\u00a0and 3 percent. And they employ more workers than dollar stores to keep perishable food stocked. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer the big-box grocery store\u201d that threatens local businesses, said David Procter, a Kansas State University professor who studies rural grocery stores. \u201cBut it\u2019s the discount retailer that\u2019s coming to town and setting up shop right across the street.\u201d Others cities are grappling with dollar stores, too. Mesquite, Tex., a Dallas suburb, approved changes to its zoning code last year that will limit the number of dollar stores. The guidelines prevent them from opening within 5,000 feet of each other. And stores must dedicate 10 percent of floor space to fresh food. In New Orleans, the city commissioned a study last year to assess the impact of dollar stores. On a recent afternoon, Jacqueline Wilson loaded honey graham crackers into her cart at a Family Dollar in North Tulsa. The nearest Walmart is a 15-mile drive. There was more dog and cat food for sale at the Family Dollar than produce. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like a desert.\u201d Wilson had a question: \u201cWhy is it taking a grant to get us a grocery store?\u201d Last March, the Tulsa Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit lender, received a $1.5\u00a0million federal grant to build a grocery store in North Tulsa. The 15,000-square-foot store will go up across from another development: a shopping center of locally owned and managed businesses, including a smoothie cafe and a UPS store. Darrell Knox opened his restaurant, Sweet Lisa\u2019s, in the center four years ago, and served up fried catfish and gumbo at another location in North Tulsa before that. He supports the restrictions on dollar stores and believes a grocer nearby would bring jobs. For years, Knox bought the food for his restaurant at a supermarket across the street. That store, Gateway Market, was also funded by a development grant. Gateway closed in 2014. The 60,000-square-foot store sits abandoned, with tiles falling from the ceiling and overturned boxes left inside. A large sign that once spelled \u201cFood\u201d above the entrance is gone, leaving the outline of what once was. Now, Knox takes his business to a Sam\u2019s Club 16 miles away. But if a grocery store were to open in District 1, he said he could spend his money locally. \u201cSometimes people want to take a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach,\u201d Knox said. \u201cIf you build it, they will come.\u201d Kojo and Onikah Asamoa-Caesar bought a home in District 1 to join that revitalization. They support restrictions on dollar stores, and they try to spend in the neighborhood. Onikah orders her groceries online now. \u201cIt\u2019s convenient for me, but it does not show the power of the dollar in the community,\u201d Onikah said. \u201cMy money is going elsewhere.\u201d Finding a grocer hasn\u2019t been simple. The Tulsa Economic Development Corporation had an agreement with one company focused on combating food deserts, but those plans fell through. That left Rose Washington, the group\u2019s executive director, to find a local group that could sell fresh, affordable groceries. Residents worried that if the food was priced too high, shoppers would just turn back to the dollar stores. This month, a deal was reached with ECO Farms, a local company that focuses on indoor vertical farming to solve food deserts. Two company executives, Jim Bloom and Adam James, said that while this is their first try at a grocery store, they\u2019re intent on making healthy food a reality in District 1 \u2014 not a luxury. \u201cWe\u2019re attending to this as a human right, not a geographic privilege,\u201d James said. But grocery stores have struggled here before. Wilson said she\u2019s considering moving to South Tulsa to be closer to a local supermarket chain and Walmart. Rent for a one-bedroom apartment there is nearly what she pays for a house in North Tulsa. But she\u2019s tired of having to drive across town for basics. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to keep living on potato chips and doughnuts and pop,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s all we are offered on this side of town.\u201d","111":"The U.S. government\u2019s top ethics watchdog has ruled that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross violated his ethics agreement by inaccurately reporting stock holdings in his 2018 financial disclosure form. Ross \u2014 one of the wealthiest members of President Trump\u2019s Cabinet \u2014 did not sell stock he held in a bank despite reporting otherwise, said Emory Rounds, director of the Office of Government Ethics. \u201cTherefore, OGE is declining to certify Secretary Ross\u2019s 2018 financial disclosure report,\u201d Rounds wrote in a letter dated Feb. 15, \u201cbecause that report was not accurate and he was not in compliance with his ethics agreement at the time of the report.\u201d Observers called the move highly unusual, and one told CNN that the office\u2019s decision amounted to \u201ca pretty giant red flag.\u201d Richard Painter, an ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, told the outlet that he has never seen a Cabinet member\u2019s disclosure form rejected in this way. In a statement Tuesday, Ross said he mistakenly believed he had sold the assets in question \u2014 100 shares of BankUnited stock \u2014 in May 2017. When he realized his error, he said, he sold the stock and disclosed the sale in October 2018. The shares, Ross said, were worth $3,700, an amount that federal regulations deem \u201cbelow the threshold of a possible conflict of interest.\u201d (According to a Bloomberg News report, that threshold is $15,000 for publicly traded securities.) \u201cTherefore, even if a BankUnited matter had come before the Department while I owned the shares \u2014 and I have not been made aware of any such matter \u2014 I would not have been disqualified from working on it,\u201d Ross said. He called the inaccuracy \u201cthe only known error in my annual report.\u201d In his letter, Rounds said his office had warned Ross before over his \u201cfailure to comply with his ethics compliance agreements\u201d and cautioned that \u201ceven inadvertent errors could undermine the public\u2019s trust in the Secretary and his Department\u2019s overall ethics program.\u201d Ross has repeatedly faced scrutiny over his investments, as lawmakers and outside groups have called for investigations into his finances. In 2018, Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, asked then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to review Ross\u2019s disclosures for \u201cpotential criminal violations.\u201d Ethics experts have said that, wrongdoing or not, government officials must avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. \u201cThe American people have entrusted @SecretaryRoss with power and authority so he can ensure the welfare of the American economy,\u201d tweeted Delaney Marsco, a lawyer with Campaign Legal Center, a public interest group. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have to wonder if he\u2019s making decisions for the benefit of the public or for his own pocketbook.\u201d Read more: White House says it will seek return of billions in federal funds for California rail line Racist comments cost Steve King his House committee roles.

United Coach Ben Olsen, who happens to be a former teammate, a close friend and the person who officiated his wedding. On a whim, Rimando decided to fly into the city with his son, Jett, to see Mumford & Sons with Olsen and his eldest son, Oscar, at Capital One Arena. \u201cOscar\u2019s first show,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cNicky is crazy. He\u2019ll jump on a plane and cross the country for a concert.\u201d The visitors crashed at Olsen\u2019s townhouse in the Shaw neighborhood of Northwest Washington and headed home the next day. Although it has been more than 14 years since he helped United win its most recent MLS Cup and a dozen-plus since he last played for D.C. (before becoming a footnote in a trade involving teenager Freddy Adu), Rimando has kept ties to Washington, mainly through his longtime buddy. On Saturday night at Audi Field, they will cross paths on soccer grounds one last time, unless both teams advance to the Nov. 10 final. Rimando\u2019s first visit to the new stadium comes after almost two decades manning the RFK Stadium nets for the deceased Miami Fusion, United for five seasons and Real Salt Lake since 2007. \u201cI was just thinking about how long it\u2019s been since I was with D.C.,\u201d he said before the team traveled east. \u201cA lot of memories: Ben, my agent [Lyle Yorks], M Street, DC101, checking to see who is playing at the 9:30 Club.\" Rimando said he does not want to talk at length about his career until the season winds down in the fall. He did not, however, hesitate to reminisce about the 2004 D.C. squad that caught fire late in the campaign, beat New England in an epic conference final \u2014 Rimando\u2019s celebratory jig after stopping Clint Dempsey in a penalty-kick tiebreaker was among many highlights \u2014 and defeated Kansas City in the title match. \u201cA lot of warm feelings about the old-school generation of MLS and what it has turned into,\u201d he said, \u201cnow that the players I used to play with are coaching.\u201d Another 2004 teammate, Mike Petke, is his head coach in Utah. \u201cI felt lucky to play to 30,\u201d said Olsen, 41. \u201cGod, another decade?\u201d Since leaving United, Rimando has become MLS\u2019s king in victories, shutouts, saves, penalty-kick saves, matches played, starts and minutes played (43,906, or 732 hours, or a month without interruption). And that does not include 37 playoff appearances. He won the league title again in 2009, beating David Beckham and the LA Galaxy in the final. He also earned 22 caps for the U.S. national team and a spot on the 2014 World Cup squad. It\u2019s an impressive march for someone who was doubted because of his size \u2014 5-foot-10 is small for a goalkeeper \u2015 and who tore a knee ligament on Giants Stadium\u2019s artificial turf in 2003. Two years after the 2004 heroics, Rimando lost the D.C. starting job to Troy Perkins. With his stock falling, he was shipped along with Adu to Real Salt Lake for another backup goalie, Jay Nolly, and a ton of financial considerations. \u201cIt was bittersweet leaving, but it was time to go,\u201d Rimando said. \u201cThe rest is history with what we\u2019ve achieved in Salt Lake and the memories we\u2019ve made.\u201d Not right away, however. Shortly after acquiring him, Salt Lake traded him to the New York Red Bulls, then reacquired him when its top-choice goalie retired. Olsen said: \u201cI don\u2019t have any real personal relationships with anyone playing anymore, mostly because of the age factor. And Nicky just keeps on ticking. And ticking at a high level. It\u2019s been a lot of fun to watch. It\u2019s nice to see him break records and become a legend in that area and elevate soccer in Salt Lake.\u201d There, Rimando is known as the \u201cWall of the Wasatch,\u201d a nod to the mountain range overlooking Salt Lake Valley. He started at least 24 regular season matches in each of his previous 12 seasons with the team. Olsen is not the only D.C. figure with long ties to Rimando. In 2007, as a rookie goalkeeper from the University of Maryland, Chris Seitz arrived at Salt Lake around the same time as Rimando. They were teammates for three seasons. \u201cHe was still a young guy looking to prove himself with a new club,\u201d said Seitz, now 32 and in his first season with United, backing up Bill Hamid. \u201cHe\u2019s smart and very true to himself, staying inside the bubble of what works for him. You are not going to see him out there fishing for crosses. He is a shot-stopper and probably the best in the league.\" Rimando\u2019s last swing through the District (for soccer, anyway) creates an awkward situation. Olsen has brainstormed ideas about how to honor him and how to beat him. \u201cHe is a big part of D.C. United, so he is certainly worth honoring,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cBut how do you do that?\u201d Memories of 2004 joy rekindling this week, Rimando sees great promise with the D.C. organization and with his buddy in charge. \u201cWhat\u2019s been going on with the stadium, with the players they brought in and with what Ben\u2019s been doing with the team,\" he said, \"I don\u2019t see it being too much longer until the next championship.\u201d Real Salt Lake at D.C.

(Photo by Oliver Contreras\/For The Washington Post) As Congress convenes its first privacy hearing of the year today, a civil rights advocate will testify\u00a0that a strong federal privacy framework is needed to protect the digital rights of people of color.\u00a0 The tech industry's sweeping data collection practices are disproportionately impacting minority groups, Brandi Collins-Dexter, senior campaign director at Color Of Change, will tell House members today. They are more vulnerable to bias in algorithms used to determine employment and housing decisions -- or even those used to calculate prices of goods sold online, she will warn. According to testimony obtained by The Post,\u00a0Collins-Dexter will tell the\u00a0House subcommittee on consumer protection and commerce\u00a0that any future privacy framework must give all people the right to know the basis for any automated decisions made about them.\u00a0 \u201cWhether intentional or unintentional, the tracking of users across the Web and what happens to that data disproportionately impacts communities of color,\u201d Collins-Dexter will say, according to prepared remarks Color Of Change shared with The Washington Post. Color Of Change\u2019s testimony on the Hill puts a fine point on how civil rights groups are increasingly emerging as challengers of Big Tech.\u00a0Collins-Dexter objects to the fact that previous privacy hearings have been dominated by industry voices: She wants to use her time on the witness stand today to convince lawmakers that ensuring protection for\u00a0minorities\u00a0online is central to any fair Internet.\u00a0 As a Senate privacy hearing scheduled for Wednesday has been criticized for\u00a0not including consumer advocates or civil rights groups, Collins-Dexter notes:\u00a0\u201cThe frame of privacy has been owned by tech wonks,\u201d she told me in an interview. \u201cReally, it's not discussed as the right to feel safe or the right to not be preyed on or the right to not have civil rights violated online.\u201d\u00a0 Brandi Collins-Dexter (Color Of Change) Today, Collins-Dexter plans to tell lawmakers just how high the stakes are for communities of color.\u00a0She will argue that\u00a0companies can use certain data such as location information as proxies for race to discriminate in advertising or hiring decisions.\u00a0 \u201cRight now corporations are able to easily combine information about you that they\u2019ve purchased, and create a profile of your vulnerabilities,\u201d she will say.\u00a0\u201cAlgorithms, which increasingly drive consumer and employee access, work as a kind of black box that can drive exclusionary practices.\u201d She'll also make the case that people of color are more exposed to certain privacy abuses because of the unique ways they use certain social media services and smartphones. Communities of color use services like Twitter or Facebook's Instagram at higher rates than white Americans, she'll testify.\u00a0She will also say that \u201cBlack and Brown people regardless of economic status rely more on their smartphones than others as their primary device to use the Internet.\u201d That could leave these groups vulnerable\u00a0to a host of privacy abuses at the hands of the tech giants, who can obtain detailed information about their location, contacts and communications through these devices.\u00a0 \u201cThis leaves Black and Brown communities grappling with how to engage with platforms not built for, operated by or meant for us,\u201d she will say in her testimony. Color Of Change wants to see policymakers address these and other privacy-related issues through a comprehensive federal privacy framework that doesn't replace any privacy provisions states pass.\u00a0Here\u2019s what the organization wants to see in a federal privacy framework: Limits on the collection, use and disclosure of sensitive personal data Enhanced limits on data belonging to children and teens Regulation of how companies build profiles about consumers based on digital data and other business practices that impact people\u2019s health, education, financial and work prospects A data protection agency that can enforce these rules Lawmakers will have plenty of recommendations to consider from the many different proposals being floated by the tech and telecom industries, privacy advocates and academics.\u00a0 Color of Change wants to give more enforcement powers to Washington regulators than do some of the industry groups floating proposals around town.\u00a0The focus on regulating how companies build data profiles about consumers could\u00a0also go further to address bias in algorithms than many of the other proposals.\u00a0 Yet representatives from business trade groups, such as the Interactive Advertising Bureau and Business Roundtable, as well as the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute and the nonprofit Center for Democracy & Technology, are also scheduled to testify at today\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe are beginning that conversation with the intention of developing legislation with the understanding that this self-regulation just isn\u2019t working,\u201d said subcommittee Chair Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) in a video about the hearing. \u201cWe look forward to having the hearing, and I promise you that I will get the job done.\u201d SpaceX CEO Elon Musk speaks at the International Astronautical Congress.

Our federal government should consider a ban on the use of Huawei inverters in the United States,\u201d the senators said in the letter, according to Reuters. \u2014 More technology news from the public sector: Indra Nooyi, chairman and chief executive officer of PepsiCo Inc., speaks during the New York Times DealBook conference. Photographer: Michael Nagle\/Bloomberg \u2014 Amazon named Indra Nooyi, Pepsi\u2019s former chief executive, to its board,\u00a0Bloomberg News\u2019s Matt Day reported. Amazon has previously faced criticism for the lack of women in its leadership ranks. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) \u2014 News about tech workforce and culture: \u2014 Tech news generating buzz around the Web: \u2014 Today in funding news: Today: Failure at Trump-Kim summit could mean a return to tensions between the U.S. and North Korea: Pence and U.S. allies in Latin America take new steps against Venezuela's Maduro: Watch high winds blow blocks of ice over from Niagara River:","114":"With Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0During his State of the Union on Jan. 30, 1974, seven months before he resigned, Richard Nixon appealed to Congress to stop probing him and his reelection campaign. \u201cI believe the time has come to bring that investigation and the other investigations of this matter to an end,\u201d he said. \u201cOne year of Watergate is enough.\u201d Forty-five years later, speaking on Tuesday night from the same spot, President Trump warned House Democrats in ominous terms against using their new subpoena power to investigate him. \u201cAn economic miracle is taking place in the United States \u2014 and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations,\u201d Trump said, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi over his left shoulder. \u201cIf there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. \u2026 We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.\u201d What the president presented, of course, is a false choice. The economy boomed in the late 1990s during a period of peace and prosperity as House Republicans investigated, and impeached, Bill Clinton. Trump didn\u2019t seem too worried about the impact of his birther crusade on the nation\u2019s health when Barack Obama was president. When they had gavels during the Obama years, House Republicans believed they had a constitutional imperative to conduct vigorous oversight of the executive branch. Many headlines this morning, just as in the previous two years, emphasize Trump\u2019s plea for both parties to come together. But the president\u2019s call for an end to the \u201cpolitical stalemate\u201d last night sounded hollow to Democrats just eight weeks after he declared that he would be \u201cproud\u201d to shut down the government to get a border wall. This brinkmanship led to the longest partial government shutdown in American history and continues to create uncertainty as a new funding deadline looms on Feb. 15. -- Teleprompter Trump never lasts. Twitter Trump always returns. The president erratically jumped between the discordant roles of unifier and disrupter. There weren\u2019t great signposts or transitions between topics, which often made the 82-minute address sound as though it had been written by committee. (There can be no doubt, though, that Stephen Miller was the main author.) \u201cJust eight hours earlier, Trump trashed Democrats \u2014 as well as ... John McCain \u2014 at a freewheeling lunch with television news anchors,\u201d Phil Rucker and Toluse Olorunnipa report. \u201cThe president remarked that the late senator\u2019s final book, a capstone to his life in public service, \u2018bombed.\u2019 He assailed Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) as a \u2018nasty son of a bitch,\u2019 ridiculed former vice president Joe Biden as \u2018dumb\u2019 for his history of gaffes, and accused Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) of \u2018choking like a dog\u2019 at a news conference where he denied being in a racist photo on his medical school yearbook page.\u201d -- Looking to 2020, Trump is again singing his greatest hits from 2016. He\u2019s like a band that struggles to play new material because the fans always want to hear the classics. He opened with paeans to unity and harked back to inspiring examples of American greatness, but he got elected promising disruption. The meat of the speech was devoted to the issues that animated his upset victory in the GOP primaries and then over Hillary Clinton. And he kept going back to the set that worked: protectionism, nativism and isolationism. His calls for rebuilding infrastructure and lowering prescription drug prices were also staples of his stump speech as a candidate. Trump is ever mindful of delivering for his base. He mentioned early on that he\u2019s delivered for \u201cthe blue-collar workers\u201d who supported him. Referring to NAFTA as a \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d he name-checked the 2020 battlegrounds of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania that will likely determine whether he secures a second term. He contrasted \u201cthe working class\u201d and \u201cthe political class.\u201d -- The president who spoke of \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in his inaugural address showed again that his brand will always be \u201ccrisis.\u201d  Trump did not declare a national emergency to allow for the unilateral, and possibly unlawful, construction of the wall he has promised Mexico would pay for. But he kept the door open to it, as he employed characteristically dark rhetoric to announce that he\u2019s deployed more troops to stop the \u201conslaught\u201d from a caravan of migrants. Our graphics team visualized the words Trump used last night that no president has ever before uttered during a State of the Union. Among them: bloodthirsty, sadistic, venomous and chilling. \u201cThe lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all Americans,\u201d Trump declared. \u201cWe have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.\u201d -- The speech \u201conce again was chock-full of stretched facts and dubious figures,\u201d write fact-checkers Glenn Kessler, Sal Rizzo and Meg Kelly. \u201cMany of these claims have been fact-checked repeatedly, yet the president persists in using them.\u201d Their story identifies 30 comments that weren\u2019t correct, and many relate to immigration: \u201cBy any available measure, there is no new security crisis at the border. \u2026 Apprehensions of people trying to cross the southern border peaked most recently at 1.6 million in 2000 and have been in decline since, falling to just under 400,000 in fiscal 2018. The decline is partly because of technology upgrades; tougher penalties in the wake of the 9\/11 terrorist attacks; a decline in migration rates from Mexico; and a sharp increase in the number of Border Patrol officers. \u2026 \u201cTrump exaggerates the link between immigration and crime; almost all research shows legal and illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population. \u2026 The consensus among economic research studies is that the impact of immigration is primarily a net positive for the U.S. economy and to workers overall, especially over the long term.\u201d -- \u201cTrump\u2019s comments on illegal immigration elicited groans, leading Pelosi to raise her hand in an attempt to quiet her members. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a former Somali refugee, listened while holding her head in her hands,\u201d Elise Viebeck and Paul Kane note. -- Like other presidents who have faced divided government, including Nixon, Trump has devoted more attention to foreign policy as his term has gone on. Obama did the same thing in 2011 after Republicans won the House. There\u2019s less room for big domestic policy gains, so the focus becomes more international. He touted negotiations with the Taliban to seek a peaceful settlement that would allow the United States to withdraw from Afghanistan. Imagine how apoplectic certain conservatives would have been if Obama had spoken to Congress about opening a dialogue with the Taliban. He also announced that he will have a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam on Feb. 27 and 28. \u201cIf I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea,\u201d Trump said, dubiously. \u201cMuch work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.\u201d -- Trump also sought to juice his standing with social conservatives by talking in stark terms about abortion. He no longer has a looming Supreme Court vacancy to keep evangelicals in line. Instead, he called for new national restrictions on women\u2019s reproductive rights during the third trimester. -- The moment that will wind up being remembered most vividly years from now came when Trump engaged with the dozens of Democratic congresswomen who were wearing white. \u201cAll Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before,\u201d the president said, \u201cand exactly one century after the Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.\u201d Wearing white, the color of the suffragists, the new female members high-fived one another and started a chant of \u201cU-S-A.\u201d If you were making a documentary about female candidates in 2018, it would be a fitting final scene as the credits roll. -- Hey, big spender: Trump didn\u2019t even make a rhetorical nod to the need for fiscal responsibility. The ballooning national debt will be a core element of Trump\u2019s legacy. It\u2019s a story line that, at least for now, continues to be under-covered. But Trump did not mention the deficit or the debt once. When the president previewed the speech for a group of supporters on Monday night, one of his allies asked whether he would discuss the deficit. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney interjected. \u201cNobody cares,\u201d Mulvaney said, per ABC News. Instead, Trump called for major new spending to eradicate HIV and develop new cancer treatments for children. Those are laudable goals, for sure, but he never talked about how he\u2019s going to pay for them. Instead, he boasted about cutting taxes, which has reduced revenue and forced the Treasury to essentially borrow more money from places like China. All of it will need to be paid back \u2014 with interest. Trump also indirectly warned that the United States might engage in a costly nuclear buildup after withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia. \u201cPerhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can\u2019t \u2014 in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far,\u201d Trump said, not giving a price tag. Unlike previous Republican presidents, Trump neglected to mention entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Other big issues Trump didn\u2019t touch included climate change, transgender rights, gun control, voting rights, forcible family separations and Puerto Rican hurricane recovery. -- But instant polls conducted after the speech showed that a significant majority of viewers approved of Trump\u2019s address. A CBS News poll found 76 percent of Americans who tuned in approved of what they saw, compared with 24 percent who disapproved. A CNN-SSRS poll showed the audience skewed Republican, with the viewership representing the most partisan tilt in any similar CNN instant poll dating to 2001. \u201cViewers were roughly 17 points more likely than the general public to identify as Republicans, and were largely fans of the President,\u201d CNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta reports. \u201cIn pre-speech surveys, 61% of speech-watchers said they approved of the job he was doing as President, compared with 40% in CNN's latest representative survey of all American adults.\u201d -- More WaPo team coverage: -- Commentary from the opinion page: WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- The Post has uncovered a 1986 registration card for the State Bar of Texas showing that Elizabeth Warren listed herself as \u201cAmerican Indian.\u201d\u00a0In an interview,\u00a0the Democratic senator said she apologizes for ever identifying as Native American. Annie Linskey and Amy Gardner report: \u201cHer comments more fully explain the regret she expressed last week to the chief of the Cherokee Nation, the first time she\u2019s said she was sorry for claiming American Indian heritage. \u2026 But as Warren undergoes increased scrutiny as a presidential candidate, additional documents could surface to keep the issue alive. Using an open records request during a general inquiry, for example, The Post obtained Warren\u2019s registration card for the State Bar of Texas, providing a previously undisclosed example of Warren identifying as an \u2018American Indian.\u2019 Warren filled out the card by hand in neat blue ink and signed it. Dated April 1986, it is the first document to surface showing Warren making the claim in her own handwriting. Her office didn\u2019t dispute its authenticity.\u201d Billionaire Joe Ricketts, whose family owns the Chicago Cubs, apologized for exchanging racist emails.

(Zach Gibson\/Getty Images) THE #METOO MOVEMENT: -- Neomi Rao, Trump\u2019s nominee to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the second-most-powerful court in the country, addressed her controversial writings on date rape during her confirmation hearing. Ann E. Marimow reports: \u201cShe also encountered resistance Tuesday from Republican Sen. Joni Ernst (Iowa), who recently disclosed that she had been sexually assaulted while in college. Rao\u2019s writings from the 1990s on date rape \u2018do give me pause,\u2019 Ernst said during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. The senator said she is concerned about the message Rao\u2019s columns send to young women \u2018about who is to blame\u2019 and has not decided whether to back Rao\u2019s nomination. \u2018I really want to know more,\u2019 Ernst said in an interview. Rao told senators that she cringes \u2018at some of the language I used\u2019 in columns she wrote as an undergraduate at Yale. \u2018I like to think I\u2019ve matured as a thinker, writer and a person,\u2019 she said. And Rao emphasized that \u2018nobody should blame the victim.\u2019\u201d -- Pope Francis confirmed that some Catholic clergy members sexually abused nuns. Max J. Rosenthal and Michelle Boorstein report: \u201c\u2018It\u2019s not that everyone does this, but there have been priests and bishops who have,\u2019 Francis told reporters aboard the papal plane on Tuesday ... Francis is due to host a gathering of bishops and cardinals in two weeks to address the broader global issue of clergy sexual abuse \u2014 including, largely for the first time, of adult victims and accountability for those at the top of the church who mismanage and cover it up.\u201d -- Two women accused the former president of Costa Rica, Nobel laureate \u00d3scar Arias S\u00e1nchez, of sexual misconduct. Kevin Sieff reports: \u201cThe allegation was reported Tuesday by Semanario Universidad, a local newspaper, and the New York Times. In interviews with both publications, the accuser explained that, at one of her meetings with Arias, he approached her from behind, touched her breasts and penetrated her with his fingers. She filed a criminal complaint against Arias this week. In a second allegation, Emma Daly, the head of communications at Human Rights Watch, told The Washington Post in an interview Tuesday that Arias groped her in 1990, when she was a reporter covering Central America and while he was still president.\u201d -- The D.C. private school St. Albans has launched an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct perpetrated by former\u00a0teachers. Justin Wm. Moyer reports: \u201cSt. Albans School in Northwest Washington announced in a letter to the school community this week that it will launch the investigation after \u2018firsthand accounts of inappropriate behavior and sexual misconduct by former St. Albans teachers.\u2019 The letter indicated there is no evidence of recent misconduct at the prestigious all-boys school. In August, The Washington Post reported allegations that teacher Vaughn Keith sexually abused a student at Key School, in Annapolis, in the 1970s and was fired for alleged sexual misconduct. Keith went on to teach Latin and classical history at St. Albans for six years in the 1980s.\u201d -- A Kansas judge sparked outrage after he described two sexual abuse victims in their early teens as \u201can aggressor\u201d in their assaults. Kristine Phillips reports: \u201c\u2018I do find that the victims in this case are more of an aggressor than a participant in the criminal conduct,\u2019 Leavenworth County District Judge Michael Gibbens said during a recent sentencing hearing just outside of Kansas City, Kan. \u2026 The defendant is Raymond Soden, a 67-year-old man who was arrested last year after, prosecutors said, he used social media to solicit sex from the minors. Soden reached a deal with the Leavenworth County Attorney\u2019s Office, and in December, was sentenced to five years in prison \u2014 about eight years short of the minimum punishment recommended in the state\u2019s sentencing guidelines.\u201d THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Federal prosecutors are seeking interviews with Trump Organization executives. CNN\u2019s Erica Orden and Cristina Alesci report: \u201cTrump and his legal team have long harbored concerns that investigations by New York federal prosecutors -- which could last throughout his presidency -- may ultimately pose more danger to him, his family and his allies than the inquiry by special counsel Robert Mueller, according to people close to Trump. Prosecutors' recent interest in executives at Trump's family company may intensify those fears. The specific inquiry or topics of interest by prosecutors in any interviews with Trump Organization executives wasn't immediately clear.\u201d -- A 1995 video surfaced showing Trump talking with Moscow officials about a possible building project in the city. The Independent\u2019s Chris Riotta reports: \u201cThe video, allegedly aired by Russian state television in 1995, shows the US president meeting with members of the former mayor\u2019s administration. \u2018Trump was in Moscow,\u2019 Yury Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow from 1992 through 2010, told the Interfax news agency. \u2018He had contacts\u2026on matters related to the construction of the Okhotny Ryad underground mall on Manezh Square.\u2019 \u2026 Mr Trump\u2019s reported meeting with Moscow officials in 1995 and the newly-unearthed footage does not show any clear wrongdoing on the part of the president. It does, however, refute the notion that he had zero dealings in Russia before assuming the White House in 2016 \u2014 a frequent claim made by Mr Trump and his inner circle.\u201d -- BuzzFeed News obtained a set of internal documents outlining how talks about a Trump Tower Moscow occurred as Trump praised Vladimir Putin on the campaign trail:\u00a0\u201cAs Trump went from rally to rally, vociferously denying any dealings in Russia, his representatives, Michael Cohen and his associate Felix Sater, worked with Trump Organization lawyers and even Ivanka Trump to push forward negotiations to build a 100-story edifice just miles from the Kremlin. The fixers believed they needed Putin\u2019s support to pull off the lucrative deal, and they planned to use Trump\u2019s public praise for him to help secure it. At the same time, they plotted to persuade Putin to openly declare his support for Trump\u2019s candidacy. \u2018If he says it we own this election,\u2019 Sater wrote to Cohen.\u201d -- Firms recruited by Paul Manafort are being investigated by federal prosecutors over foreign payments. The New York Times\u2019s Kenneth P. Vogel reports: \u201cThe previously unreported interviews about the flow of the money are among the latest developments in the investigation of key figures who worked at the three firms \u2014 Mercury Public Affairs, the Podesta Group and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Prosecutors have focused on the role of Skadden Arps\u2019s lead partner on the account, the former Obama White House counsel Gregory B. Craig, in arranging financing and media coverage for his firms\u2019 work, the people familiar with the questioning said. And the prosecutors, they said, have also been asking about the extent to which the lead partners on the accounts for Mercury and Podesta \u2014 Vin Weber, a former Republican member of Congress, and the Democratic fund-raiser Tony Podesta \u2014 were involved in orchestrating their firms\u2019 day-to-day lobbying and public relations on the account.\u201d -- A memo surfaced showing how the company owned by Tom Barrack, the president\u2019s inaugural chair, aimed to exploit his connections to the Trump administration. Justin Elliott and Ilya Marritz report for ProPublica: \u201cThe memo outlines a \u2018strategic plan\u2019 for Colony, which now has $44 billion under management, to ramp up its operations in Washington and open an office there. It envisions \u2018setting up roundtables between Ambassadors and members of the Administration to cultivate relationships\u2019 in areas including infrastructure and plans to \u2018tie into international bilateral meetings already occurring with key members of the Trump Administration.\u2019 \u2026 Barrack\u2019s company should do all this while keeping a low profile, seeking to build a \u2018subtle brand,\u2019 the memo says.\u201d -- House Democrats will ramp up their investigations into Trump\u2019s alleged Russia ties this week. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cThe House Intelligence Committee is expected to vote Wednesday to provide [Mueller] with all interview transcripts from its Republican-led probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \u2026 On Friday, [Michael Cohen], who already pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, is due to provide private testimony before the panel. \u2026 And the House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hear public testimony Friday from acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker as part of its probe of circumstances surrounding Mueller\u2019s investigation.\u201d -- Stormy Daniels dropped her defamation claim against Michael Cohen. Mark Berman reports: \u201cDistrict Judge S. James Otero, in a ruling issued Monday, allowed Daniels to amend her complaint to drop the allegation against Cohen. Otero wrote that he was dismissing the defamation claim \u2018with prejudice,\u2019 adding that this meant Daniels \u2018cannot simply re-litigate the defamation cause of action.\u2019\u201d -- The National Enquirer\u2019s reporting on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s affair has led some to speculate it was a political hit job, given the president\u2019s criticism of the Post owner and the tabloid\u2019s connections to the Trump campaign. Marc Fisher, Manuel Roig-Franzia and Sarah Ellison report: \u201cThe saga might have been easily dismissed as little more than tabloid fare, but it has taken on a more serious cast in recent days. A volley of charges and countercharges about how and why the Enquirer launched its investigation has emerged for several reasons, including the history of the Enquirer, which has acknowledged taking actions during the last presidential campaign that benefited Trump politically. Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly lodged attacks on The Post\u2019s coverage of him and on Bezos, who bought the news company in 2013. And Bezos, the head of a retail giant that is famously loath to comment to the media, has authorized his security chief to speak about his investigation. \u201cBezos\u2019s longtime private security consultant, Gavin de Becker, has concluded that the billionaire was not hacked. Rather, de Becker said in an interview, the Enquirer\u2019s scoop about Bezos\u2019s relationship with former TV anchor Lauren Sanchez began with a \u2018politically motivated\u2019 leak meant to embarrass the owner of The Post \u2014 an effort potentially involving several important figures in Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. As the Daily Beast first reported last week, de Becker has publicly named only one subject of his investigation, Michael Sanchez, Lauren\u2019s brother and a pro-Trump Hollywood talent manager who is also an acquaintance of provocative Trump backers Roger Stone and Carter Page.\u201d Republican lawmakers watch Trump deliver the State of the Union. (Jonathan Newton\/The Washington Post) THE IMMIGRATION WARS: -- Senate Republicans indicated they might agree to less border wall money than Trump wants but also signaled uncertainty about where Trump stands. Erica Werner and Robert Costa report: \u201cSen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of the bipartisan committee of House-Senate negotiators that is working on writing a border security bill, said both sides have moved off their initial positions. In the case of Republicans, that was the $5.7 billion Trump has been demanding for his wall \u2014 while Democrats\u2019 starting point in the negotiations was to offer no money for physical barriers on the border. Blunt said Tuesday that $5.7 billion \u2018is not a magic number, that\u2019s for sure.\u2019 Asked whether that was Trump\u2019s view as well, Blunt said: \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know about that. I think at the end of the day it would be, if we can write this the right way.\u2019\u201d -- New Mexico\u2019s governor ordered the state\u2019s National Guard to withdraw most of its troops from the southern border. Robert Moore reports: Gov. Michelle\u00a0Lujan Grisham, \u201ca Democrat who took office last month after serving six years in the U.S. House, made the announcement shortly before [Trump\u2019s] State of the Union address, in which he spoke of a \u2018tremendous onslaught\u2019 at the southern border. Lujan Grisham said she would keep some New Mexico Guardsmen in the southwest corner of the state, which has seen a huge influx of Central American families in recent months. But she said she rejected \u2018the federal contention that there exists an overwhelming national security crisis at the southern border, along which are some of the safest communities in the country.\u2019\u201d -- San Diego\u2019s Republican mayor announced an initiative to help welcome immigrants to the city. The AP\u2019s Julie Watson reports: \u201cEconomic growth is tied to immigrants, with one in four people in San Diego foreign-born, Mayor Kevin Faulconer said at a news conference, surrounded by civic and business leaders, including former Republican mayor Jerry Sanders, who heads the Chamber of Commerce. \u2018San Diego is proud to be a destination for immigrants in search of an opportunity,\u2019 Faulconer said, adding that immigrants from around the globe \u2018define who we are as a region.\u2019 The announcement came less than a week after San Diego County decided to provide a building to shelter asylum seekers after they are released from detention.\u201d -- A senior Customs and Border Protection official apologized after an agent at a passport control checkpoint grilled a BuzzFeed News reporter about the outlet\u2019s Michael Cohen story. BuzzFeed's Ellie Hall reports: \u201c\u2018On behalf of the agency, I would like to extend our apologies to Mr. David Mack for the inappropriate remarks made to him during his CBP processing upon his arrival to the United States,\u2019 CBP Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs Andrew Meehan said \u2026 Mack, BuzzFeed News' deputy breaking news director, landed at JFK Airport Sunday night after a brief trip to the United Kingdom to renew his US work visa. \u2026 Mack said that the [CBP] agent saw BuzzFeed listed as his employer on his visa and began to ask him questions about the outlet's reporting\u201d on\u00a0Mueller's investigation.

Matt Viser reports: \u201cIn a theater in Times Square \u2014 and sandwiched in a program that started with actor Michael B. Jordan and ended with actor-director Bradley Cooper \u2014 the former Texas congressman outlined the case for a Democratic candidate who could knit together a divided country and dropped hint after hint that he believes that candidate should be him. \u2018I have been thinking about running for president,\u2019 he said, to a large round of applause. \u2026 \u2018I\u2019ve got to tell you.

Tulsi Gabbard\u00a0(D-Hawaii) condemned David Duke after the former KKK grand wizard endorsed her presidential bid. \u201cI have strongly denounced David Duke\u2019s hateful views and his so-called \u2018support\u2019 multiple times in the past, and reject his support,\u201d Gabbard said in a statement. \u201cPublicizing Duke's so-called \u2018endorsement\u2019 is meant to distract from my message: that I will end regime-change wars, work to end the new cold war and take us away from the precipice of a nuclear war, which is a greater danger now than ever before.\u201d Duke had previously posted a picture of Gabbard with text reading, \u201cTulsi Gabbard for President. Finally a candidate who will actually put America First rather than Israel First!\u201d (The Hill) -- Howard Schultz will deliver what aides are billing as a major policy speech tomorrow to outline his vision for an independent presidential campaign. Michael Scherer reports: \u201cSchultz has yet to commit to a presidential campaign, and he has dismissed claims that he would be a spoiler, saying he will not do anything to help reelect Trump. In the meantime, his advisers have also argued that the controversy and media coverage over his potential run will ultimately help him deliver his message to the American people.\u201d -- Schultz\u2019s investment in a for-profit college could become a political liability for him if he runs for president. Politico\u2019s Christopher Cadelago reports: Schultz\u00a0\u201cinvested millions of dollars and personally owned stock in Capella University, a troubled for-profit college that overcharged the federal student loan program hundreds of thousands of dollars, records show. \u2026 The Office of the Inspector General in a 2008 audit found it overcharged the student aid program by $588,000 for the school years between 2002 and 2005 \u2014 and recommended that Federal Student Aid officials require the university to return the improperly retained funds.\u201d -- Former Massachusetts governor\u00a0William Weld changed his party registration back to Republican as he considers a primary challenge against Trump. The AP reports: \u201cWeld served as a Republican governor from 1991 until 1997. He later became a Libertarian and ran for vice president on a ticket with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson in the 2016 election. The clerk\u2019s office in Canton, Massachusetts, confirms on Tuesday that Weld recently changed his party registration to the GOP. \u2026 He recently told WMUR-TV in New Hampshire that he would discuss his potential political plans during a Feb. 15 visit to the first primary state.\u201d -- Mitch McConnell said he hopes Secretary of State Mike Pompeo runs for Kansas\u2019s Senate seat days after Trump dismissed the possibility. Felicia Sonmez and Sean Sullivan report: \u201c\u2018I\u2019d sure like for him to think about it,\u2019 [McConnell] said of Pompeo during an interview on Fox News Channel. He added that Kansas has a late filing deadline and that \u2018there\u2019s no urgency for him to make that decision.\u2019 \u2026 But Trump recently dismissed the notion that Pompeo would leave his post to run for Senate. \u2018I asked him the question the other day. He says he\u2019s absolutely not leaving,\u2019 Trump said in an interview on CBS\u2019s \u2018Face the Nation\u2019 that aired Sunday.\u201d THE LATEST FROM RICHMOND: -- Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, who built his political career on his honesty and authenticity, was shocked by the immediate calls from Democratic allies for his resignation after a racist photo was discovered on his medical school yearbook page. Gregory S. Schneider and Laura Vozzella have a behind-the-scenes look at the chaos engulfing Richmond: \u201cMost of his staff was gone for the night as [Northam] and his wife, Pam, worked the phones in the Executive Mansion. They called friends back in Norfolk, old classmates from his medical school, looking for answers about the racist photo that had emerged from his 1984 yearbook. When advisers showed up the next morning to what they thought would be the task of helping Northam resign, the near-sleepless governor had a surprise. \u201cThis isn\u2019t me,\u201d he told them Saturday, according to one adviser. \u2026 That set what was already a crisis into uncharted waters, as Northam staged a national news conference and defied calls to step down from virtually the entire political establishment. \u2026 \u201cBut his assumption that allies would give him the benefit of the doubt contributed to Northam\u2019s poor handling of the crisis over the photo, according to people close to the governor. And his shock at being so quickly discarded by the party has made it harder for Northam to accept the calls to resign, the people said. Over the past several days, he has even toyed with the idea of leaving the Democratic Party and governing as an independent \u2014 a sign of the degree that he is isolated from every political ally, from his state party and from the national party.\u201d -- Northam has started signaling to his few remaining allies that he thinks he can remain in office, according to the New York Times\u2019s Alan Blinder, Jonathan Martin and Trip Gabriel. \u201cThe governor, whose power has been on the verge of collapse since the photograph surfaced on Friday, intends to hire a private investigator to examine the circumstances of the picture, according to a Democrat familiar with his plans. \u2026 And Mr. Northam\u2019s supporters have begun to express increased confidence that he will hold on to his job, despite a national onslaught of condemnation, in part because the Republicans who control the General Assembly have demonstrated little urgency toward seeking his ouster.\u201d -- Democratic leaders are struggling with how to respond to a sexual assault allegation against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who would become governor if Northam resigns. From Jenna Portnoy, Laura Vozzella and Antonio Olivo: \u201cAlthough Democrats at the state and national level have been quick to say women should be believed and that all allegations should be investigated, they say they are resisting a rush to judgment. Unlike claims of assault against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, former senator Al Franken (D-Minn.), former congressman John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and others, Virginia Democrats privately note the accuser in the Fairfax case has not yet offered evidence she says corroborates her claim. The dilemma shows the trouble they have enforcing a policy of zero tolerance.\u201d -- If both Northam and Fairfax resign, Attorney General Mark Herring (D) would become governor, Larry J. Sabato and Kyle Kondik of U-Va.\u2019s Center for Politics note. \u201cIn the immediate aftermath of the Northam bombshell and Fairfax\u2019s seemingly likely ascension to the governorship, we thought back to Herring\u2019s decision to defer to Northam in advance of the 2017 election \u2026 With Fairfax potentially becoming governor, Herring \u2014 who previously announced his intention to seek the governorship in 2021 \u2014 could have been effectively blocked. Yet as of now, Herring is only one of the three elected Democratic statewide officeholders without a cloud over his head.\u201d Sabato and Kondik add that Northam\u2019s continued presence in the governor\u2019s mansion could have a detrimental effect on Democrats\u2019 efforts to retake control of Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates or Senate next year: \u201cRepublicans are hanging on to very slim majorities in the state House of Delegates (51-49) and state Senate (21-19). \u2026 Democrats seemed like favorites to win both chambers \u2026 particularly because a new state House of Delegates map imposed by judicial order will improve Democratic odds in that chamber. \u2026 But one could imagine the opposite happening, particularly if Northam hangs around and depresses Democrats, or the Fairfax allegations continue to churn.\u201d Gen. Joseph Votel, the commander of U.S. Central Command, testifies yesterday before the Senate Armed Services Committee. (Andrew Harnik\/AP) THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- The Senate passed its Middle East policy bill that includes a rebuke of Trump\u2019s plans to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cThe measure combines several legislative efforts that have been percolating through Congress in recent years, including an increase in sanctions against anyone who supports the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an extension of support to Jordanian security forces helping to combat the Islamic State and other threats to regional stability, and an authorization of security assistance to Israel. It also includes a politically controversial measure to bolster state and local laws to limit the reach of a global anti-Israel boycott campaign protesting the occupation of Palestinian territories \u2014 a provision that could spark challenges in the House, where some of the party\u2019s newest members are opposed to efforts seeking to limit criticism of Israel.\u201d -- The top U.S. general in the Middle East told a Senate panel he \u201cwas not consulted\u201d about Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria. The Daily Beast\u2019s Spencer Ackerman reports: Gen. Joseph Votel\u00a0\u201cwill next month step down from U.S. Central Command, where he has been in charge of the war against the Islamic State since 2016. He told [the Senate Armed Services Committee] that withdrawal will occur in a \u2018deliberate and coordinated manner,\u2019 with its details still under development. Votel also agreed with Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) that withdrawal from Syria will reduce some of the military pressure on ISIS, which he described as a \u2018resilient network.\u2019\u201d -- Saudi Arabia has transferred weapons sold to it by the United States to al-Qaeda-linked fighters and Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen. CNN\u2019s Nima Elbagir, Salma Abdelaziz, Mohamed Abo El Gheit and Laura Smith-Spark report: \u201cSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, its main partner in the war, have used the US-manufactured weapons as a form of currency to buy the loyalties of militias or tribes, bolster chosen armed actors, and influence the complex political landscape, according to local commanders on the ground and analysts \u2026 By handing off this military equipment to third parties, the Saudi-led coalition is breaking the terms of its arms sales with the US, according to the Department of Defense. After CNN presented its findings, a US defense official confirmed there was an ongoing investigation into the issue.\u201d -- John Cantlie, a British journalist abducted by the Islamic State six years ago, is believed to still be alive. The New York Times\u2019s Rukmini Callimachi, David D. Kirkpatrick and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a report: \u201cMr. Cantlie has been seen in several propaganda videos made by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, but the last one was released more than two years ago. On Tuesday, Ben Wallace, Britain\u2019s minister for security, told journalists at a Home Office briefing that Mr. Cantlie was thought to be alive, though he did not disclose how the government might have knowledge of his condition.\u201d Trump speaks during a meeting to discuss fighting human trafficking on the southern border. (Oliver Contreras for The Washington Post) WEST WING INTRIGUE: -- Trump\u2019s leaked calendars show the president has an unusual amount of unstructured time in his day compared with\u00a0his predecessors, historians said. Toluse Olorunnipa reports: \u201cInterviews with historians and a review of the schedules of recent former presidents released through their presidential libraries highlight the degree to which Trump\u2019s sparse official schedule appears to be an anomaly. \u2026 Most former presidents reported starting their mornings in the Oval Office, and adhering to a packed and highly regimented daily schedule that included briefings, ceremonial events, and meetings and phone calls with lawmakers and foreign leaders.\u201d -- Mick Mulvaney invited a bipartisan group of lawmakers to Camp David. Politico\u2019s John Bresnahan and Jake Sherman report: \u201cIt's the second time in recent weeks that Mulvaney has invited lawmakers to Camp David, although this is the first session that includes Democrats, according to administration officials. \u2026 Trump is not planning to attend the get-together.\u201d -- A new report found that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019s home state of Michigan ranks last in total education revenue growth between 1995 and 2015. Valerie Strauss reports: \u201cThe Michigan State University study, titled \u2018Michigan School Finance at the Crossroads: A Quarter Century of State Control,\u2019 offers a comprehensive look at school funding in the state since the 1994 passage of a law known as Proposal A, which largely shifted funding from local school districts to the state. According to the report, total K-12 education funding declined by 30 percent between 2002 and 2015, with 74 percent of that drop caused by declining state support for schools.\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: A senior adviser to Trump's reelection bid sparked outrage by suggesting female Democratic lawmakers' choice to wear white at the State of the Union was connected to the KKK: The color was actually a tribute to suffragists: The outspoken pro-Trump president of Liberty University, Jerry Falwell's son, made this sweeping statement about the speech: The freshman House Democrat who replaced Beto O'Rourke accused Trump of lying about her Texas district: The mayor of San Juan expressed frustration with the lack of reference to Puerto Rico: The moderator of \u201cMeet the Press\u201d highlighted something Trump neglected to mention in his speech: A New York Times reporter shared an image of lawmakers' reactions to Trump's comment on late-term abortions: The Onion poked fun at Democrats' choice of speaker to deliver the response: This 2016 tweet from Tulsi Gabbard recirculated after David Duke endorsed her 2020 bid: Al Franken appeared at a D.C. book event: The president's daughter and adviser reacted to an art exhibit featuring her likeness: A bipartisan pair of senators went to a spin class together: And spring training is just around the corner: GOOD READS: -- Bloomberg News, \u201cInside Wisconsin\u2019s Disastrous $4.5 Billion Deal With Foxconn,\u201d by Austin Carr: \u201cInterviews with 49 people familiar with Foxconn\u2019s Wisconsin project, including more than a dozen current and former employees close to its efforts there, show how hollow the boosters\u2019 assurances have been all along. While Foxconn for months declined requests to interview executives, insiders describe a chaotic environment with ever-changing goals far different from what Trump and others promised. \u2026 The only consistency, many of these people say, lay in how obvious it was that Wisconsin struck a weak deal.\u201d -- \u201cPope Francis just made history by visiting the Arabian Peninsula. But was he a pawn?\u201d by Dalia Hatuqa: \u201cReligious history was made this week on the Arabian Peninsula, with Pope Francis becoming the first pontiff to visit the region. \u2026 Yet to many Muslims like me, the famously humble and open pope may have allowed himself to be a pawn as his Gulf interlocutors use him to bolster their facade as a tolerant, liberal society while suppressing diversity and freedom and waging war in Yemen.\u201d HOT ON THE LEFT: \u201cTrump\u2019s travel to Mar-a-Lago alone probably cost taxpayers more than $64 million,\u201d from Philip Bump: \u201cOn Tuesday, [the Government Accountability Office] released a report looking only at Trump\u2019s first four trips to Mar-a-Lago as president: on Feb. 3-6; Feb. 10-12; Feb. 17-20; and March 3-5, 2017. The total? Just under $14 million, for an average cost of $3.4 million per trip. That includes about $8.5 million spent by the Defense Department and $5 million by the Department of Homeland Security. It also includes about $60,000 paid directly to Mar-a-Lago itself, $24,000 of which was for lodging for Defense Department personnel and $36,000 for operational space used by DHS. \u2026 If we, therefore, assume a blanket average of $3.4 million per trip, regardless of duration, the total the government has spent on Trump\u2019s trips to the resort tops $64 million.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT: A group of Trump\u2019s allies traveled to the southern border to explore the idea of privately funding a border wall. Politico\u2019s Ben Schreckinger reports: \u201cIn what amounted to a kind of #MAGA field trip, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, former Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo, baseball legend Curt Schilling, and former Sheriff David Clarke convened to plan construction of a wall along the southern border.

(Candace Buckner) -- Prosecutors plan to push D.C. gun crimes into federal court to help combat a spike in the city\u2019s murder rate. Spencer S. Hsu and Peter Hermann report: \u201cWith homicides in the District climbing 40 percent last year and still rising, federal prosecutors\u2019 goal is to bring all \u2018felon-in-possession\u2019 gun cases to U.S. District Court instead of D.C. Superior Court, according to the people briefed on the plan. In 2018, there were 350 of those gun cases brought in the District, but only one-quarter were charged as federal crimes. The changes, effective Feb. 1, bring to bear prosecutorial and incarceration tools last used widely in the District two decades ago and revive tactics that critics say fueled a mass-incarceration crisis easing only now.\u201d -- The District\u2019s $2.1 million bid to save a Columbia Heights dog run has sparked criticism from some city residents. Marissa J. Lang reports: \u201cWhen the District approved a budget last year allocating $1.5 million to buy the parcel of land from Metro and establish an official dog park, many thought their work was done. Then the \u2018for sale\u2019 sign went up. As the city now prepares to offer $2.1 million to acquire \u2014 and \u2018save\u2019 \u2014 the park, critics have questioned the wisdom of funneling millions into a neighborhood dog run, rather than using the money to address citywide issues, such as affordable housing.\u201d VIDEOS OF THE DAY: Late-night hosts made jokes\u00a0about Trump's State of the Union: Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) gave a speech\u00a0posted to her Facebook page before Trump's address: Ralph Northam's medical school reacted to the racist picture included on his 1984 yearbook page: And a dinosaur with spines along its back was discovered in Patagonia:","115":"Tesla chief Elon Musk\u2019s corporate jet flew more than 150,000\u00a0miles last year, or more than six times around the Earth, as he raced between the outposts of his futuristic empire during what he has called \u201cthe most difficult and painful year\u201d of his career, according to flight records obtained by The Washington Post. The billionaire executive\u2019s frequent travel on a private plane was largely paid for by Tesla, the cash-burning automaker that faces billions of dollars in debt and has laid off thousands of employees within the last year, including slashing 7\u00a0percent of its workforce this month. Musk\u2019s jet logged more than 250 flights for his work, pet projects and vacations across Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East during a year when he said his electric-car giant was losing up to $100 million a week and teetered on the brink of collapse. But Musk\u2019s relentless schedule was eased by a level of convenience and luxury few but the ultrawealthy can afford. Some of the flights were recreational getaways for Musk or his family, while others involved moving the plane from one side of Los Angeles to the other to help Musk shorten his commutes. The company will face questions about its spending when it reveals its annual earnings report Wednesday, and investors will be looking closely to see whether Tesla will squeeze out a profit despite deep losses earlier in the year. The frenzy of air travel was a key part of Musk\u2019s journey to becoming a global celebrity, showing how suddenly his attention could switch between his ambitious ventures on cars in California, batteries in Nevada, tunnels in Chicago and rockets in Florida. It provides a glimpse at the wild life of America\u2019s most polarizing tech superstar, underscoring the chaos of a year in which he savaged his enemies as idiots and pedophiles, smoked weed during a live interview and got sued by federal authorities accusing him of misleading investors \u2014 a move that cost him his chairmanship on Tesla\u2019s board. But it also reveals an awkward dynamic for one of the world\u2019s most outspoken crusaders of renewable energy: In September, a few days after calling fossil fuels \u201cthe dumbest experiment in human history,\u201d his plane burned thousands of pounds of jet fuel flying 300\u00a0miles from L.A. to Oakland so Musk could view a competitive video-gaming event. (Tesla said Musk went to the video-gaming event with this kids but also met with a Tesla board member and went to work at two Tesla offices in Fremont before flying home.) \u201cWe know we\u2019ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually,\u201d Musk tweeted in November on the same day his jet flew over Mexico for what Tesla says was a personal trip. \u201cSo why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe?\u201d Musk was not made available for comment, but a Tesla spokesman said his heavy air travel was an indispensable part of doing business. \u201cUntil we can teleport, there\u2019s unfortunately no alternative that would allow him to do his job as effectively,\u201d spokesman Dave Arnold said. Musk is worth more than $20 billion, but his companies have footed the bills for the jet\u2019s fuel, maintenance, crew and other expenses. In a June financial filing, Tesla said Musk\u2019s rocket company SpaceX operated the plane and sent Tesla a tab worth roughly $700,000 in 2017. The company said Tesla does not cover the costs for Musk\u2019s personal trips and that Musk, SpaceX and Tesla review the flights and agree on who pays for each trip. The company declined to offer an estimate for Musk\u2019s flight costs last year, when data show the jet\u2019s air travel increased. Tesla said it also covered the business expenses of a second aircraft owned by Musk, paying another $46,000 in 2017. Though Musk has often bemoaned \u201csoul-destroying traffic\u201d as the inspiration for his business interests in high-speed tunnels and self-driving cars, he has spoken little about his secret weapon for avoiding it: a 2015 Gulfstream G650ER that sells for about $70\u00a0million. It is one of the world\u2019s fastest and largest ultra-long-range executive aircraft; only a few hundred have been made. The Post obtained the flight data from an industry official, who provided it on the condition of anonymity, and confirmed details through Freedom of Information Act requests with the Federal Aviation Administration. The data does not show who was onboard during the flights, but aspects of Musk\u2019s travel were confirmed by his public appearances, interviews and tweets. Musk is far from the only corporate leader to depend on the speed, flexibility and privacy of flying across the world on a private plane, and his high-profile role as chief executive, visionary and hype man for multiple companies helps explain why he would rely on it so heavily to get around. (Tesla contested the description of Musk as a \u201chype man,\u201d and said he should instead be referred to as a \u201chands-on problem solver,\u201d which would explain why he travels so much.) But even compared to his peers, Musk\u2019s travel stands out. Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos \u2014 another West Coast tech billionaire with worldwide business ventures and the same kind of Gulfstream jet \u2014 flew 100 fewer flights than Musk did last year, a Post analysis found. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Apple, which made 19 times as much in revenue as Tesla did in 2017, paid roughly $93,000 for chief Tim Cook to fly on private aircraft \u2014 a fraction of the $700,000 Tesla spent that year. Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said Musk\u2019s travel was symptomatic of a troubling executive culture, in which public shareholders pay for the high-profile trips of their company\u2019s \u201csuperstar.\u201d \u201cDo the rank and file get to use the company plane for vacations? Do the rank and file get to use company property for personal purposes? Of course not. They\u2019re Tesla, as much as he is,\u201d Elson said. \u201cThis company has some real financial issues, and (he\u2019s) spending other people\u2019s money.\u201d Musk has characterized 2018 as an agonizing year for the companies he said teetered between \u201clife or death.\u201d The company\u2019s survival, he said, was due in large part to his herculean workload and self-sacrifice, including sleeping on the Tesla factory floor and working 120-hour weeks. \u201cHowever hard it was for\u201d his employees, he told \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d \u201cI would make it worse for me.\u201d But the flight records reveal some gaps in Musk\u2019s self-assessment of a ceaselessly \u201cexcruciating\u201d year. In a New York Times interview last summer, Musk said he spent his 47th birthday working nonstop in the Tesla factory \u201call night \u2014 no friends, nothing,\u201d before flying to his brother\u2019s wedding in Spain, saying he arrived shortly before the ceremony and left immediately afterward to rush straight back to work. The interview did not mention, however, that Musk actually left the ceremony on the Spanish coast and flew to Northern Ireland, where he visited the film set for the HBO fantasy epic \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d with his children and ate dinner at a Belfast pub, according to local media reports. (\u201cBelfast is beautiful,\u201d Musk tweeted after the trip.) That trip was three weeks after Musk announced Tesla would lay off about 3,500 employees, or 9 percent of its workforce, as part of a reorganization he called \u201cdifficult, but necessary.\u201d A Tesla official said it was the Times\u2019 characterization, not Musk\u2019s, that he left immediately afterward, but that Musk did cut short his participation in wedding festivities scheduled to last several days. The jet is registered to a subsidiary of SpaceX called Falcon Landing, named for its reusable rocket, Federal Aviation Administration records show. Musk or his associates took an additional step, common among top business executives, to request the travel not be logged on public flight-tracking databases. Many of the flights took off from or landed at L.A.\u2019s Van Nuys airport, a short drive from the tony neighborhood of Bel Air where Musk owns five separate mansions. It was on an August drive to his jet there, Musk told the Times, that he tweeted Tesla had the \u201cfunding secured\u201d to be taken private \u2014 a market-shaking promise that ultimately fell flat. Musk and Tesla later agreed to pay a $40\u00a0million settlement and institute new safeguards to resolve a Securities and Exchange Commission case alleging Musk had misled investors about the deal\u2019s prospects. Musk\u2019s jet flew roughly 75 times last year to the San Jose airport, the closest stop to Tesla\u2019s headquarters in Palo Alto and car-making factory in Fremont, where Musk often said he was so busy he would end up sleeping among the machines. Dozens of other flights were made to airports near SpaceX\u2019s headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif., and the battery-producing Gigafactory outside Reno, Nev. Tesla said Musk never used the plane to fly between different spots in Los Angeles. But the jet would fly to meet him at a closer airport if, say, he began his workday at SpaceX\u2019s office on the south side of L.A. and the plane was on the north side, the company said. Some of these repositioning flights only went about 20 miles, the aircraft data show. Musk\u2019s trips could be a whirlwind of business pursuits, with his role quickly switching from one venture to the next. In early June, Musk flew to a SpaceX office outside Seattle, where he fired a number of high-ranking officials working on a satellite project, unnamed company employees told Reuters. The flight records show Musk returned to California shortly after and, within days, was on a flight to Chicago to advocate alongside Mayor Rahm Emanuel for a government-backed tunnel system, built by Musk\u2019s new tunnel-transit business The Boring Company. But the jet also allowed Musk to skip commercial air travel when he took some time off. In the first three months of 2018, a quarter during which Tesla\u2019s investor pressures were boiling over and the company burned through more than $1 billion in cash, the jet flew more than 50,000 miles, including for a vacation in Chile, a tour of the set for the HBO robo-drama \u201cWestworld\u201d in Texas and a spring-break trip with his kids to Jordan and Israel. In May, a few days after berating financial analysts for what he called \u201cboring bonehead questions\u201d about Tesla\u2019s spending, Musk took the jet to New York, where he attended the glitzy Met Gala with his then-girlfriend, the electronic musician Grimes. On Musk\u2019s most infamous trip last summer, a few days after he had returned from his brother\u2019s wedding, he flew to Thailand for the delivery of a mini-submarine he said could help save a youth soccer team trapped in a sunken cave. The vessel went unused in the rescue, but shortly after his trip home, Musk told his tens of millions of Twitter followers a rescue volunteer who had criticized Musk\u2019s mini-sub was a pedophile. That volunteer, Vernon Unsworth, has sued Musk in an ongoing lawsuit. Musk\u2019s lawyers defended the comments as having arisen from a social-media \u201cschoolyard spat.\u201d Musk\u2019s jet soared as his companies faced escalating pressure from Tesla shareholders over the company\u2019s cash burn, which totaled hundreds of millions of dollars a month. In June, when Tesla laid off 9 percent of its workforce, Musk emailed employees that they were \u201cmaking this hard decision now so that we never have to do this again.\u201d Earlier this month, Musk again emailed workers that the company had \u201cno choice\u201d but to cut another 7 percent of its full-time staff and many more temporary workers and contractors. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any other way,\u201d he said. The cuts have fed new doubts from Wall Street that Tesla can transform into a reliably profitable car company, and its stock has plunged more than 20 percent from its 2017 peak. Musk\u2019s problems have expanded into other parts of his empire, too: Tesla\u2019s most recent mass layoff came in the same week that SpaceX announced it would be terminating 10\u00a0percent of its employees, saying it must \u201cbecome a leaner company.\u201d Musk, however, has shown few signs of sticking to a leaner flight itinerary. He ended 2018 the way he began it, with an international flight: a private business trip to Shanghai.","116":"It\u2019s one of the most dispiriting rituals that attend State of the Union addresses in the Trump era: White House advisers piously promise us that President Trump will issue new calls for unity and bipartisan comity, and for reasons that remain baffling, far too many observers then feel obliged to pretend that these soothing exhortations are real. But this time around, there\u2019s just no excuse for playing along. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve already seen what happens in the real world after Trump stands before Congress and carries out his unity routine \u2014 not once, but twice. The New York Times reports that White House officials are previewing a speech that will supposedly \u201clean into a bipartisan and optimistic vision for the country.\u201d White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway vows that it will call for \u201ccomity\u201d and \u201ccompromise.\u201d Former White House spokesman Raj Shah gushes that Trump can \u201cturn the page\u201d with \u201cunifying, patriotic, and optimistic themes that have worked well for him in previous addresses.\u201d So let\u2019s talk about those \u201cprevious addresses,\u201d and about what happened in their wake. Idea of \u2018presidential\u2019 Trump takes root, and becomes stock joke In his 2017 joint address to Congress, delivered just after he took office, Trump claimed to be delivering a \u201cmessage of unity,\u201d exhorted the country to be \u201cunited in condemning hate and evil in all its forms,\u201d called for \u201chealing and hope,\u201d vowed to \u201cwork with members in both parties,\u201d and directed the two parties to \u201cunite for the good of our country.\u201d Headlines proclaimed Trump\u2019s speech \u201csurprisingly presidential.\u201d Speaking about Trump\u2019s staged moment honoring a slain Navy SEAL\u2019s widow, one commentator enthused that \u201che became president of the United States in that moment.\u201d That line quickly became a stock joke. And for good reason. Barely a month before Trump issued those soothing words, nationwide mass protests had already erupted over the travel ban he signed upon taking office, a measure haphazardly thrown together in naked malevolence to fulfill a campaign promise premised squarely on openly advertised anti-Muslim bigotry and lies, in defiance of internal administration analyses undercutting its fake national security rationale. In the weeks after his speech, as his administration rewrote the ban to get around the courts, Trump blithely conceded that the new one was merely a \u201cwatered down\u201d version, again confirming the bad faith and malevolent intent saturating this whole process. Only a few months later, in August 2017, Trump refused to unambiguously condemn white supremacist violence and murder in Charlottesville, instead blaming \u201cmany sides.\u201d Trump only made more conciliatory remarks after aides pushed him into it, whereupon he privately exploded that this made him look \u201cweak,\u201d and reverted to the \u201cmany sides\u201d formulation. Importantly, Trump had concluded his base would thrill to the \u201cmany sides\u201d approach, which means he deliberately placed the goal of keeping his base enthralled before the presidential obligation of unifying the country at moments of searing national tension. Also in mid-2017, Trump pardoned former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who had abused and violated the rights of untold numbers of Latino immigrants. Trump had become \u201csold on the pardon as a way of pleasing his political base,\u201d again actively placing the desire to thrill his rally crowds before any institutional obligation to consider the impact of his conduct on the rule of law and the rest of the country. Anyone else notice a pattern here? In his State of the Union speech in January 2018, Trump called upon the two parties to \u201cset aside our differences,\u201d to \u201cseek out common ground,\u201d and to \u201csummon the unity we need to deliver for the people.\u201d Only a couple weeks earlier in 2018, we had learned that Trump privately derided people coming here from places like Haiti, El Salvador and Africa as immigrants from \u201cs---hole countries.\u201d Crucially, this ugly impulse drove administration policy, in that Trump rejected immigration compromises precisely because in his view they allowed too many people from those countries to remain here. Those prejudices actively trumped \u201ccommon ground\u201d and \u201cunity.\u201d Only a few months later, Trump\u2019s horrific family separations hit. Planning for the policy was slapdash, surprising officials who struggled to implement it. But Trump had pulled the trigger while claiming \u201cmy people love it,\u201d again confirming the malevolence, bad faith and prioritization of the base\u2019s prejudices festering at the core of such decisions. Similarly, as the Associated Press reported, Trump privately resolved to revive his attacks on African American football players because so doing \u201crevs up his political base.\" What followed throughout 2018 was the most virulently xenophobic and anti-immigrant campaign in modern memory. It was girded by an extraordinary campaign of agitprop and lies about desperate asylum-seeking migrants, and painted Democrats as a party enabling hordes of violent invaders and even cop-killers to breach our border. Trump\u2019s two-tiered speeches A smart Democratic strategist recently remarked to me that he believes Trump and his political operation are carrying on a conversation with his voters that is 24\/7 and is heavily laden with cultural and emotional signaling in a manner that Democrats have not quite reckoned with yet. The last two speeches to Congress took a two-tiered approach: Trump throws out a few nuggets of superficially unifying rhetoric designed to garner approval from elite centrist commentators, while also keeping a conveyor belt laden with bloody meat running to his supporters. It\u2019s all but certain that we\u2019ll hear the same in his third installment. But, given all that has followed after the last two, can we stop pretending that the unifying tones are anything other than a scam?

Here\u2019s one answer.","117":"QUEENSTOWN, New Zealand \u2014 Finland\u2019s nationwide basic income experiment has captured international attention ever since it began in January 2017. Researchers finally released preliminary results last week, and the verdict is more mixed than both supporters and opponents of the experiment may have hoped. Over the past two years, 2,000 randomly selected and unemployed Finns older than 25 and younger than 58 were paid about $640 a month, tax-free and with no conditions attached. Although that\u2019s less than monthly unemployment benefits in Finland, which are more than $100 higher, basic income recipients continued to receive the payments even after they had found jobs. Researchers had hoped that this promise may encourage their trial participants to put more effort into landing a job. In reality, they remained just as likely to be unemployed as other Finnish residents receiving ordinary benefits. But what struck researchers was a more unexpected side effect: Basic income recipients appeared to have become happier overall, suggesting that their well-being increased even though average unemployment rates remained largely unchanged. The Finnish findings feed into a broader debate about how lawmakers should measure the success of societies. GDP growth or stock market performance are still frequently being used as indicators for how well a country is doing, yet those key figures are often far removed from the realities residents experience. The United States may have one of the world\u2019s highest gross domestic products, but it came in 18th in the world for national well-being in 2017, according to Social Progress Imperative, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization. The debate about whether to drop our traditional measurements of economic success has gained more momentum in recent months, as some world leaders have publicly backed initiatives to move away from those metrics and have instead argued that more emphasis should be put on citizens\u2019 well-being. Francine Closener, Luxembourg\u2019s state secretary for the economy, already acknowledged two years ago that there was a disconnect between measured GDP and perceived well-being in her country. \u201cIt takes people a lot longer after a low point to start experiencing higher levels of well-being again,\u201d she said, cautioning that GDP data had not revealed the extent of the problem. Luxembourg has started to measure citizens\u2019 well-being with different metrics, also taking into account education or personal security, among other factors. New Zealand was among the first countries to support an initiative by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which urged its member states once again in November to \u201clook beyond the functioning of the economic system to consider the diverse experiences and living conditions of people and households.\u201d In its report last year, the organization proposed that governments should focus more on quality of life, which includes health and work-life balance among other factors, as well as ensuring future well-being and material conditions such as income and wealth. New Zealand has since considered various ways to translate the OECD\u2019s theoretical ideas into specific policies. Authorities also slightly adapted the framework to reflect advances or shortcomings in fostering the cultural identity of the country\u2019s Maori population, for instance. In May, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is set to introduce what she calls \u201cthe world\u2019s first \u2018well-being budget.\u2019 \u201d \u201cWe must accept that the race to grow our economies makes us all poorer if it comes at the cost of our environment, or leaves our people behind,\u201d Ardern wrote in an op-ed for the London-based Financial Times last month. In practice, the prime minister indicated that a well-being budget could include mental well-being support schemes for younger citizens, but also projects designed to tackle \u201cclimate change, digital transformation, social exclusion, poor health, housing and domestic violence.\u201d Whether Ardern can deliver on those promises will probably take years to determine, but in the meantime her government already has come under criticism for supposedly not delivering on her promises to provide more affordable housing within a short time frame. More lasting than any single policy, however, would be a growing consensus in redefining how societies\u2019 success should be measured, beyond GDP and unemployment data. So far, the most promising experiments on this front have emerged from smaller countries, such as Luxembourg and New Zealand, which are already ranking relatively high in well-being statistics. Bigger nations may not be ready to switch their attention fully to a different set of metrics, but interest appears to be on the rise. \u201cOur well-being approach is generating significant international interest, particularly at a time when the international rules-based order is under strain and leaders are grappling with constituencies dissatisfied with the status quo,\u201d Ardern said in January, when she promoted the idea at the Davos conference in Switzerland. Ardern\u2019s critics have mainly lashed out at her proposal for being too complicated to be widely implemented, but her supporters maintain that it\u2019s a path worth exploring: \u201cThere is no good argument why well-being should not be a national aspiration,\u201d wrote Anna Matheson, a public health lecturer at Massey University in Wellington. For governments willing to go down that path, however, there\u2019s the risk of failure. After two years of Finland\u2019s basic income experiment, the government there has decided to look for different ways to decrease unemployment. Participants who were happier but still just as unemployed apparently didn\u2019t match Finland\u2019s criteria of a successful society.

But experts are skeptical that the agency's new tech-focused task force will result in tough action -- such as breaking up\u00a0Facebook and its subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram.\u00a0 For those consumer advocates who think Facebook should be stripped of its largest acquisitions, the announcement of a new agency task force on competition is a far cry from the strong crackdown on Silicon Valley they would like to see. As the\u00a0technology company is under fire for broad abuses of users\u2019 data, they say the company's strategy of\u00a0buying\u00a0up its most promising competitors have left it with no serious challengers and outsized power -- and the FTC still isn't doing nearly enough.\u00a0 Matthew Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, said:\u00a0 The fact that the FTC is creating a task force focused solely on competition in the tech industry \u2014 and dedicating a whopping 17 attorneys to it \u2014 shows that the agency is hearing calls for it to police tech titans at a time when lawmakers are concerned about Big Tech's outsize power. But there are many reasons why experts say the move will do little more than pay\u00a0lip service to the issue.\u00a0 First, any effort to bust up tech companies would likely result in costly and lengthy legal battles that the FTC may be unwilling or unable to take on. From CNBC's editorial director of technology coverage: Second, consumer advocates pointed out that reviewing current and previous mergers is already the FTC's job -- and that it shouldn't need a new task force to take this kind of action.  \u201cObviously, we are glad that the FTC is looking more closely at competition in the tech sector, but the creation of the task force is not a substitute for overdue enforcement action,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. The group\u00a0has called on the FTC to use its authority to break off Instagram and WhatsApp from Facebook. Bruce Hoffman, the director of the FTC\u2019s competition bureau, wouldn\u2019t say in a call with reporters whether it would specifically look into Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram, saying it couldn\u2019t comment on \u201cany pending investigation or specific plans for investigations.\u201d But Hoffman did say that if FTC were to review completed mergers, it would \u201chave the full panoply\u201d of remedies at its disposal, which could include breaking up companies or spinning off companies. But of course, the agency would have to meet legal standards that would hold up in court \u2014 and that\u00a0would be no easy task.\u00a0 That's because there are legal questions about how existing competition rules should be applied to the tech giants.\u00a0The task force is emerging as some congressional Democrats are reviewing existing competition laws \u2014 which have traditionally focused on whether monopolies set\u00a0unfair prices that harm consumers. Some believe the laws may have to be updated to apply to free digital services such as\u00a0Facebook and Google.\u00a0 These lawmakers took the new announcement as a sign the FTC is taking their work seriously. Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), the House antitrust subcommittee chair, has been a leading voice on tech competition\u00a0in Congress. He applauded the new task force\u00a0on Twitter: To be sure, the time is ripe for change on antitrust laws -- as there is strong political pressure on both sides of the aisle for the FTC to take a harder look at Silicon Valley companies.\u00a0Though Facebook took the spotlight yesterday, President Trump has previously said that his administration is also looking at Amazon and Google for antitrust violations. Google's acquisition of advertiser tool DoubleClick and Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods are two other tech mergers that critics say skated by antitrust regulators with little scrutiny.\u00a0\u00a0 Tim Wu, the author of \u201cThe Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age,\u201d who has built the case for a breakup of Facebook and Instagram, said he's hopeful the task force could result in change in Silicon Valley:\u00a0 It's too early too tell if Silicon Valley companies should be shaking in their boots, said David Vladeck, a former\u00a0director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. The task force is an unprecedented initiative, he said, and it shows the agency is serious about taking a closer look at the tech industry. Even if the FTC doesn't go so far to break up existing tech mergers, retrospective analysis could give the agency insights that may be useful when reviewing future deals.\u00a0 \"This will give the agency a better sense of where companies like Facebook and the next Instagram stand,\" he said.\u00a0 The logos for Time Warner and AT&T at the New York Stock Exchange on June 13, 2018. (Richard Drew\/AP) BITS: A federal appeals court upheld AT&T and Time Warner's merger, The Washington Post's\u00a0Brian Fung reported. The court\u00a0said the Justice Department, which opposed the merger, did not prove its claim that a lower court failed to apply \u201cfundamental principles of economics\u201d when it examined the potential effects of the merger on consumers. \u201cWhile we respect the important role that the U.S. Department of Justice plays in the merger review process, we trust that today\u2019s unanimous decision from the D.C. Circuit will end this litigation,\u201d AT&T said in a statement, according to my colleague. The decision by a three-judge panel also represents a setback for\u00a0Makan Delrahim, the top antitrust chief at the Justice Department.\u00a0It's the second time Delrahim has lost in court in an attempt to block the merger.\u00a0\u201cBut while the decision could mean the end of the AT&T-Time Warner battle, it probably will not settle a growing debate in Washington about the adequacy of America\u2019s antitrust laws and whether regulators have been too meek overall in challenging mergers,\u201d Brian wrote.

Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said his panel intends to take a look at social media sites. \u201cThe argument that these are immature industries, and need to be given free rein \u2014 I don\u2019t think that applies there now among the most capital-intensive, successful businesses on the planet,\u201d Schiff told Tony in a recent interview. \u201cVigorous oversight is now the new normal.\u201d Facebook chief executive\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill in Washington on April 10, 2018.

Governments that seek to get ahold of data in investigations or to prevent threats may be unable to do so when devices or products are encrypted. Britain in 2016 passed legislation that can require tech companies to turn in data to law enforcement. India is also mulling rules that would give authorities access to some WhatsApp data, the Journal reported. Australia has also passed a law that critics say could result in weakening encryption. \u201cOn Thursday, a coalition of civil society groups, trade associations and nine tech companies, including Facebook Inc., which owns WhatsApp, Apple, Google, Twitter Inc. and Microsoft Corp. filed comments with the Australian government warning that the law, passed in December, could create back doors into technology products,\u201d the Journal reported.

They want to rebuild your home. They want to take away your hamburgers,\u201d former White House aide Sebastian Gorka declared at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday. \u201cThis is what Stalin dreamt about but never achieved.\u201d In fact, Joseph Stalin was unambiguously pro-hamburger: In the 1930s, he sent his food supply commissar on a research mission to the United States, which resulted in kotleti, a Soviet rip-off of the classic ground-beef burger, being popularized throughout Russia. Also, and more relevant to today, none of the Democrats backing the Green New Deal, which seeks to radically overhaul the U.S. economy to cut greenhouse gas emissions, have actually suggested outlawing beef consumption, or, for that matter, seizing pickup trucks. But Gorka\u2019s hyperbole \u2014 which was met with chants of \u201cU-S-A! U-S-A!\u201d \u2014 demonstrated how Republicans have turned environmentalists\u2019 recommendations to eat less meat into an all-out culture war in which nothing less than American freedom is at stake. First, they came for your guns, the argument goes, and now they\u2019re coming for your sausage links. Conservatives have been gearing up for this particular battle for several years now: The Daily Beast notes that far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones tried to taunt President Barack Obama by posing for photos with a platter of raw meat back in 2016, even though there was no particular reason Obama, who also eats meat, would be bothered by the sight of uncooked steaks. But it\u2019s heated up over the past month, thanks to the introduction of the Green New Deal. Blame it on the farting cows. The now-infamous quote appeared in a since-retracted fact sheet that the office of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) put out at the start of February, stating that the resolution\u2019s authors aimed to reach net-zero emissions, rather than zero emissions, within 10 years \u201cbecause we aren\u2019t sure that we\u2019ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s spokesman told The Washington Post that the remark was clearly intended to be ironic, but it was too late: President Trump and the right-wing media were already declaring that the Green New Deal was going to eliminate cows and airplanes altogether. In reality, the resolution calls for the government to work collaboratively with ranchers to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions \u201cas much as is technologically feasible.\u201d And, for the record, while cows are responsible for a surprisingly large percentage of the methane gas that gets released into the atmosphere, that gas is mostly released through burps, rather than farts, according to one expert cited by The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker. During an appearance on Showtime\u2019s \u201cDesus & Mero\u201d last week, Ocasio-Cortez clarified once again that no one would be forced to go vegan under the Green New Deal. But there was a legitimate need to \u201caddress factory farming,\u201d the freshman congresswoman added. \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, let\u2019s keep it real.\u201d Her suggestion that Americans might not need to eat burgers at every single meal went over about as well as you might expect. \u201cREP.

In one response that gained thousands of likes and retweets on Twitter, a man whose bio described him as an advocate for limited government replied with a photo of a gigantic burger that consisted of at least 10 beef patties layered in between congealed slices of melted American cheese and topped with roughly a dozen strips of glistening bacon. \u201cMy lunch,\u201d he wrote, adding that it was designed to troll Ocasio-Cortez. Reddit users later discovered that the photo had been pulled off Pinterest. On Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez was spotted eating dinner at a Washington restaurant. Her chief of staff, who was sitting next to her, ordered what looked like a hamburger. Naturally, the photographs immediately went viral. \u201cRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has been caught in full-blown hypocrisy mode,\u201d the conservative website LifeZette declared. \u201cShe\u2019s been pictured with her chief of staff downing a hamburger just days after telling Americans they need to cut cows out of their own diets.\u201d By Wednesday, the idea that Democrats were planning to crack down on an all-American tradition had gone from being an Internet meme to an actual talking point for members of Congress. Republican members of the House Natural Resources Committee chomped on burgers at a news conference criticizing the Green New Deal, while on Twitter Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) claimed that the resolution would \u201cban hamburgers,\u201d end air travel and outlaw cars. The next day, while speaking at CPAC, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) joked that the Green New Deal would at least be good for Chick-fil-A\u2019s stock, since getting rid of all the cows would result in people eating a lot more chicken. It all added up to literal red meat for the base \u2014 and any hamburger-loving Americans. Overstated claims about a ban on hamburgers could potentially become an effective tactic, Vice\u2019s Harry Cheadle wrote on Thursday, because they attract plenty of news coverage while also forcing Democrats to go on the defensive and explain that, no, they\u2019re not really trying to outlaw ground beef. Plus, it\u2019s an easy argument to make: People may not want to read a wonky, fact-based critique of the Green New Deal, but they do enjoy their burgers. Perhaps not coincidentally, Congress\u2019s hamburger wars are heating up at a time when Republican lawmakers in state legislatures nationwide are trying to crack down on how imitation meat and dairy products are marketed to consumers. Last August, Missouri became the first state to ban labeling plant-based meat substitutes with terms like \u201cground beef-style crumbles\u201d or \u201csoy turkey slices,\u201d which would force a significant number of companies to either change their packaging or pull their products from grocery shelves. The statute has yet to go into effect, however: It was blocked by a lawsuit from the faux-meat company Tofurky, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri and others who contend that it violates the First Amendment. Though it\u2019s unclear whether Missouri\u2019s labeling law will hold up in court, similar bills have been introduced in South Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado and Arizona this year. Supporters, including lobbying groups for the cattle and pork industries, argue that terms like \u201cvegan sausage\u201d are misleading and confusing for consumers. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is when you walk up and use simple words like \u2018milk,\u2019 we should know what that\u2019s from,\u201d David Cook, a Republican state representative in Arizona who is also a cattle rancher, explained at a hearing on Wednesday. \u201cAlmonds do not lactate.\u201d Opponents, who disagree that anyone could be confused about where tofu dogs come from, claim that amounts to censorship. The ACLU of Missouri has called that state\u2019s law \u201ca brazen attempt to stifle the growing grocery category of plant-based meat.\u201d At CPAC on Thursday, however, Gorka\u2019s defense of hamburgers focused on what he described as the encroaching threat of socialism. The Green New Deal, he said, was like a watermelon: \u201cGreen on the outside, deep, deep red communist on the inside.\u201d More from Morning Mix: The feds spent a decade trying to seize Mongol Nation\u2019s notorious patch.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposed \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d the boldest may be her plan for paying its multitrillion-dollar price tag. We can do it, she said in a blog post that has since been removed from her website, \u201cin the same ways that we paid for the 2008 bank bailout and the extended quantitative easing programs, the same ways we paid for World War II and many other wars.\u201d In other words, we can have the Federal Reserve pay for it. Wouldn\u2019t having the Fed pick up the tabs for multitrillion-dollar projects cause inflation? Not long ago, it would have. But during the subprime crisis, the Fed took steps that severed the once relatively tight link between the amount of government debt it took on and the tendency of prices to increase. As a result, it\u2019s now more tempting than ever for politicians to expect the Fed to serve not just as the banking system\u2019s lender of last resort, but as the government\u2019s financier of first resort. The Fed used to have a good excuse for not financing big projects Before the crisis, the Fed kept a lid on inflation by limiting the supply of bank reserves, meaning the actual cash banks keep in their tills, vaults and cash machines, together with deposit credits they can draw on at their district Federal Reserve Banks. Banks need reserves to meet minimum legal requirements and to settle accounts with one another at the end of each business day. Generally, the more deposits and loans banks have to manage, the more reserves they need. So long as they also keep no more reserves on hand than they need, as is the case when reserves don\u2019t pay interest, the Fed can control inflation by making reserves more or less plentiful. To combat deflation before the crisis, the Fed created fresh reserves by buying government securities in the open market. The sellers of those securities then deposited the proceeds with their banks, adding to their reserves. To combat inflation, it unloaded securities from its portfolio, taking back an equal sum of reserves. Under this traditional setup, if the Fed bought too many securities, inflation would break loose. Consequently, whenever Congress, or some president, pressured Fed officials for funding, they had a ready answer: They could only do so much without violating the Fed\u2019s mandate. Sometimes the excuse didn\u2019t work During both world wars, and again during the spending surge accompanying the Vietnam War and the Great Society, the Fed yielded to government pressure. But the consequences were as predicted: rising prices or (in the case of World War II) strict wage and price controls, with their attendant shortages. Still, fear of these consequences made it relatively easy for the Fed to resist peacetime demands that it buy up government debt. Now the game has changed A dramatic change came with the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Bros. Fearing that its post-Lehman emergency lending would cause it to blow past its inflation goal, the Fed deliberately severed the link connecting reserve creation to inflation by starting to pay interest on bank reserves. The idea was to get banks to sit on extra reserves that came their way, instead of using them to grow their own balance sheets. The change meant that the stance of monetary policy no longer depended on how many reserves the Fed created, or how many securities it purchased. Instead, it depended on how high or low the Fed set the interest rate it paid on bank reserves. Although the Fed soon switched from fearing inflation to fighting recession, it kept on paying banks to hoard reserves, and did so even as other central banks turned to negative interest rates. Instead of going negative itself, the Fed resorted to unprecedented purchases of long-term government securities, in a policy that became known as \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d in the hope that such purchases would boost the economy despite banks\u2019 tendency to stockpile cash. A temporary fix has become permanent Although the Fed\u2019s unconventional post-crisis system was originally supposed to be temporary, it officially became permanent when Chairman Jerome H. Powell announced, at his Jan. 30 news conference, the Fed\u2019s \u201cdecision \u2026 to continue indefinitely using our current operating procedure for implementing monetary policy \u2026 so that active management of reserves is not required.\u201d That \u201cactive management of reserves is not required\u201d means, among other things, that the Fed can create any quantity of reserves, and, hence, purchase any amount of government debt, without losing control of inflation. Were inflation to break out, it could check it by further raising the interest rate it pays banks to hold reserves. That\u2019s assuming, of course, that the government itself doesn\u2019t check inflation by raising taxes or spending less. Because inflation still has to be guarded against somehow, the Fed\u2019s newfound ability to stock up on government debt doesn\u2019t add up to a free lunch. It does give politicians whose pet projects come with big price tags more reason than ever to suggest that the Fed can pay for them.

On a busy street in Chawkbazar in the oldest part of Bangladesh\u2019s capital, restaurant cooks stood outside preparing roti bread on flat, circular tandoor grills as people whizzed by on motorcycles, auto-rickshaws and on foot. Suddenly, flames consumed the scene in surveillance-camera footage local media published Saturday of the deadly fire in Dhaka this past week. The blaze killed at least 67 people and injured 50 others. Earlier Saturday, Bangladeshi Prime minister Sheikh Hasina visited some of the dozens of people injured in the fire, while investigators said they had found a huge stock of flammable materials stashed in the basement of the five-story building where the blaze began. Hasina told reporters outside a burn unit of the Dhaka Medical College and Hospital that she wants all the chemical warehouses removed from the oldest part of Dhaka, a 400-year-old area cramped with apartments, shops and warehouses. Police said the fire began in a five-story building housing highly flammable chemical products. \u201cIt\u2019s regretful that still there are chemical godowns in Old Dhaka despite repeated drives against them,\u201d Hasina said. Government zoning regulations prohibit industrial activities in residential buildings. A government effort last May to clear warehouses and makeshift stalls blocking narrow alleyways in Chawkbazar and neighboring districts was met with protests by business owners and residents. Obaidul Quader, general secretary of Hasina\u2019s ruling Awami League party and a Cabinet minister, said in Chawkbazar on Saturday that there would be \u201cno compromise\u201d in removing the warehouses from the area and that \u201ca new journey has started through learning lessons from previous mistakes.\u201d Debashish Bardhan, a deputy director of the Fire Service and Civil Defense, told The Associated Press that investigators discovered a cache of combustible chemicals like drums full of dye pigments and rolls of plastic sheets on Friday in the basement of the building, and that the fire could have been far more devastating if it had spread to that area. Bardhan, a member of one of the fire investigation committees, said they were still collecting evidence from the scene to determine how the fire started and why it spread so quickly. Police have said that they are seeking up to a dozen suspects in connection with the fire and could charge them with negligence. Relatives of a 19-year-old killed in the blaze filed a separate case with police accusing the owners of a building where chemical products were stored and that caught fire of \u201cdeath by negligence, sabotage and damage of goods,\u201d said Abdul Halim, a police investigator in Chawkbazar. He said no arrests had been made.","122":"Justin Paperny, wearing his luckiest pair of golfing slacks, was about to tee off at Calabasas Country Club in Calabasas, Calif., last Tuesday morning when his phone began buzzing. On the other line was a familiar voice, a well-known lawyer whose client had recently been charged by the Justice Department for their role in a sprawling admissions scandal involving dozens of parents and name-brand schools like Yale, Georgetown and the University of Southern California. The lawyer wanted to know whether Paperny \u2014 a federal prison consultant and convicted felon who prepares people for life behind bars \u2014 was available to discuss the case. The answer was yes. But like most of his work, Paperny explained, a hefty price tag would be attached. While the college admissions scheme captured the public\u2019s attention last week, temporarily uniting the left and the right in mutual disgust, prison consultants like Paperny went to work. Part fixer, part adviser and part therapist, their jobs amorphously range from soothing exaggerated fears about sexual assault and answering the basic questions about hygiene (i.e. \u201cHow do I use the bathroom in federal prison?\u201d) to managing portions of a business when they\u2019re behind bars. Like hardened sherpas leading well-heeled clients up a treacherous peak, they\u2019ve smoothed the road to incarceration for big name clients like Bernie Madoff, Martha Stewart and former NBA referee Tim Donaghy. For a wealthy client ensnared by the admissions scandal, Paperny said one question in particular undoubtedly looms: \u201cWill I ever work again?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a million questions that go through people\u2019s minds in the beginning,\u201d said Paperny, who helps clients organize their finances and find job opportunities before they go into prison, as well as after. \u201cThe hardest part is the public shame and embarrassment and not knowing how it\u2019s going to affect your career and your finances.\u201d \u201cThose questions are harder than any day they may serve,\u201d he added. \u201cThese people in this admissions scandal are already in federal prison \u2014 they\u2019re just not getting credit for time served.\u201d For Paperny, last week\u2019s call wasn\u2019t the only reason one of largest news stories in the country hit particularly close to home. A southern California native who played baseball at USC, the 44-year-old is a regular lecturer on ethics at the university\u2019s Marshall School of Business. Already struggling to recover from recent controversies, his alma mater is ground zero for the admissions scandal, a place where six of the 50 alleged perpetrators \u2014 including several prominent athletics officials \u2014 have close ties. As a former Bear Stearns stock broker who spent 18 months in federal prison for conspiring to commit fraud, Paperny is uniquely qualified to discuss ethical failings when he visits the university. A decade after his release, his eight-person firm, \u201cWhite Collar Advice,\u201d has become a go-to resource for wealthy criminals preparing for prison. His YouTube channel, which covers much of the advice he gives his clients, has several thousand subscribers. Paperny \u2013\u2013 who has close ties to Hollywood and its glut of high-profile criminal defense attorneys \u2013\u2013 still looks the part of the life that led him astray. Clean-shaven and and professional-looking, he favors trim suits and trendy Travis Mathew apparel on the golf course. He\u2019d look equally at home behind a desk inside a Wall Street hedge fund or a corporate law firm, his confident demeanor still infused with a hint of his former brashness. Paperny said he\u2019s already been hired by one person tied to the college admissions scandal and provided The Washington Post with an invoice showing a down payment of several thousand dollars. But, he said, multiple people charged in the scandal have reached out to him for advice and he suspects he may be hired by several of them. New clients are drawn to him, he said, because he doesn\u2019t make unrealistic promises or attempt to downplay the difficulty of their situation. He maintains the criminal justice system incarcerates far too many people, wasting tax-payer dollars and ruining lives out of habit. At the same time, he embraces his own troubled past like other people embrace college, calling prison \u201ca growth opportunity\u201d and \u201cone of the best experiences\u201d of his life. It\u2019s a message he\u2019s even delivered to the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va. Paperny said his fee \u2013\u2013 which could reach tens of thousands for his latest client \u2013\u2013 is high, in part, because he\u2019s one of the few people who can speak to upper-crust criminals in a language they understand. The first step, he said, is often breaking through the denial that afflicts privileged first time offenders. To aid them in this process, Paperny asks some clients to film YouTube videos where they recount their illegal behavior, such as one he filmed with Jonathan Schwartz, a former business manager who was sentenced to six years in prison for embezzling millions from singer Alanis Morissette. The quicker Paperny can get a client to accept responsibility, the better his chance of helping them reduce a possible sentence later on. What they desperately want to avoid, he said, is a situation like Paul Manafort faced last month when a judge questioned his seeming lack of regret. How would he reach a privileged parent caught in an admissions scandal? \u201cI would tell them that I empathize with them, that I have no doubt that they probably had good intentions and that it\u2019s clear they didn\u2019t think about the consequences of their conduct and instead of making matters worse, they can take ownership of their situation and start to improve things,\u201d Paperny said. \u201cFor some it\u2019s brutal to hear that,\u201d he added. \u201cThey don\u2019t consider themselves criminals, but fathers and mothers and members of the community who have contributed things to society.\u201d Federal prosecutors would appear to disagree. They\u2019ve charged 50 people with crimes like conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud that could result in multi-year prison sentences. The unregulated prison consultant industry, which is full of ex-convicts, has long been a controversial one. This year, three people from the industry were accused of helping ineligible convicts attempt to reduce their sentences by fraudulently gaining access to the Residential Drug Abuse Program (known as RDAP), according to the Associated Press. Aside from the potential for abuse, prison consulting also raises important moral considerations, according to Robert M. Franklin, a professor of moral leadership at Emory University. \u201cThis is a fascinating and disturbing phenomenon,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to preserve and transfer the inequalities of opportunity in the free world right into the prison, a place designed to level and equalize status. Remorse, hard work and merit should govern future prospects, not money.\u201d Paperny said his company has also worked with indigent clients referred to them by public defenders and he often works within people\u2019s budgets. He said his goal is not to provide privileged people with an unfair advantage, but to provide the government with a \u201cdifferent story\u201d about someone\u2019s life than the one they\u2019ve heard from prosecutors. \u201cMy goal is for the judge and others to see that perhaps one bad decision should not define someone\u2019s whole life and that the rest of that life is taken into consideration when they\u2019re sentenced,\" he said. When Mike Shelley found out he was the target of a criminal investigation by the FBI in 2018, he panicked, his mind conjuring up a series of prison horror stories that suddenly felt all too real. \u201cIt was like a bucket of ice water being dumped on you,\" he said. \u201cYou read about people being indicted every day in the news, but never expect it to happen to you. For somebody like me who has never been in any trouble, you automatically default to what you\u2019ve seen on TV and in the movies about prison.\u201d Clueless about how to prepare, Shelley got online and Googled, \u2018What\u2019s life like in a federal facility?\u201d His search led him to Paperny, whom he hired as the life he\u2019d built began to unravel. The 38-year-old former bank president had gone from being a respectable member of the small community where he lives in Sherman, Tex., someone accustomed to advantages and opportunities, to a pariah without a career. Paperny served as a bulwark against the chaos, Shelley said, offering guidance that has been well worth the thousands of dollars he\u2019s spent on prison consulting. During weekly phone calls, Paperny helped Shelley prepare for an intensive pre-sentencing interview and he worked with family and friends on character reference letters, which are written to influence sentencing decisions. \u201cThe judge later told me those were the best letters he\u2019d ever seen,\u201d Shelley said proudly. Paperny also coached Shelley on talking to his 10-year-old son about the storm swirling around his father. Nearly a year later, as Shelley prepares to begin a decade-long prison sentence next week at a low security correctional facility about an hour from his home, his biggest concern is no longer his own safety or whether he deserves his punishment, but the effect his incarceration will have on his wife and child. To deal with that concern, Shelley said, Paperny has coached him to approach the experience with a singular goal in mind: reducing his sentence by about half though good behavior so he can come home to take care of his family. \u201cI\u2019m at peace with my sentence,\" he said. \u201cThe real punishment is really to those that love you. This experience will be way harder on my wife and my son than it will ever be on me.\"","123":"Of many bold ideas pitched in Rep.

But I love winning more. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a great offseason. .\u2009.\u2009. We do feel like we have three closers now,\u201d he added, referring to new additions Rosenthal and Kyle Barraclough. \u201cBut you can never have too many weapons at the back end of the game.\u201d Kimbrel already has an agent. But he should consider Doolittle, the man who would be affected most and perhaps lose the most money if his closer job were taken away. Of Kimbrel\u2019s career ERA of 1.91, well ahead of immortal Mariano Rivera at 2.21, Doolittle simply said, \u201cIt\u2019s insane.\u201d Kimbrel remains unsigned because he started the offseason asking for $100 million over six years \u2014 $14 million more than the record for a reliever \u2014 and he hasn\u2019t adjusted his sense of reality to today\u2019s free agent market, especially for relievers, which has crashed. Also, Kimbrel has shown a flaw only once in his career \u2014 but he picked an expensive time for it. His 2.53 ERA and 42 saves last season for the Boston Red Sox look fine, especially after a brilliant 2017. But after the All-Star Game, including October, he had a 5.01 ERA with 6.4 walks per nine innings. His velocity was career normal (96.8\u00a0mph), and his vicious breaking ball snapped. But his bouts of wildness made you sweat. \u201cKimbrel is 30. He\u2019s got 330 saves. He\u2019s as proven and battle-tested as you could want,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cHe\u2019s durable, dependable and incredibly effective. He\u2019s been superhuman. Okay, so the second half last year wasn\u2019t as good. He wasn\u2019t lights out in the playoffs. .\u2009.\u2009. But look at his whole body of work.\u201d What if Doolittle is now a bit more effective than Kimbrel? \u201cWe can figure that out,\u201d Doolittle said, shrugging away that and any other bullpen usage issues. \u201cI\u2019ve heard nothing but great things about him. Quiet guy, but really funny.\u201d Armed with these ideas, I tried to provoke a Nats veteran by saying: \u201cThis team looks good. But it may be one Craig Kimbrel away from a deep October run.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right,\u201d he said, to my surprise. Most players on all teams want to add stars so they can win more. Just like fans (and writers), they love to spend the owner\u2019s money. But Kimbrel would be a decent payroll fit for the Nats. He\u2019d probably cost about $5 million extra in luxury-tax penalties this season. But next season, the Nats have more than enough money dropping off their payroll to get under that ceiling, even if they extend Anthony Rendon, too. What about the compensation pick, and the international draft money that the Nats would lose if they signed Kimbrel? MLB\u2019s current mantra is that the Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros and Red Sox built their core through the draft. True. But it\u2019s conveniently forgotten that those clubs added big contracts in years when they could smell a title, including Justin Verlander, Gerrit Cole, Jon Lester, John Lackey, Jason Heyward, Yu Darvish, David Price, Chris Sale and (the past three years in Boston) Kimbrel. \u201cThe guy you get for that second-round compensation pick won\u2019t be as good as you already know that Craig Kimbrel is,\u201d the veteran player said. Recent history among free agent superstar relievers has crunched Kimbrel\u2019s market. Two years ago, Aroldis Chapman and Kenley Jansen shattered reliever records with five-year deals for a combined $166 million. Since then, both have been good, but Chapman\u2019s ERA has risen by 0.75, and Jansen allowed 13 homers last year. Even four-year deals have been questioned since Mark Melancon, who got $62 million, was a bust. As a result, no free agent reliever has gotten more than three years or more than $39\u00a0million (Zack Britton). General managers, including the Nats\u2019 Mike Rizzo, get a stern expression when Kimbrel is mentioned. Rizzo knows his veteran performance may have rolled over. He hates losing compensation picks and international money, especially when he sees the fruits of those dollars in Juan Soto, Victor Robles and Luis Garcia. And he knows his owners don\u2019t want to go over the luxury tax for a third straight year, meaning every extra dollar is hit with a 50\u00a0percent tax. \u201cA lot of people involved with a team want to spend more money. It\u2019s \u2018free\u2019 [to them],\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cBut [over time], that approach catches up with you.\u201d For me, this comes down to the opportunistic use of precious baseball money. Kimbrel, even as a slight overpay, is an opportunity, especially when the Phillies, Braves or maybe Los Angeles Dodgers, all in the NL, are most likely to grab him. When the stock of a great company plummets until you can\u2019t believe it has gotten so cheap, that is either a great investment or a \u201cvalue trap.\u201d The Nats need to decide which Kimbrel is \u2014 and fast. If he\u2019s \u201cvalue,\u201d then he takes pressure off setup man Rosenthal, who is coming back from elbow surgery, and helps Doolittle, who is not fragile but hasn\u2019t been a workhorse, either. Also, if you\u2019re not going to spend money in 2019, 2020 and 2021, when your rotation includes Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin, when will you? The best comparison to Kimbrel for me is the career arc of Jonathan Papelbon. When young, he had a 1.74 ERA for four years. Then at 29 and 30, his ERA jumped to 3.41. That scared some teams away from him in free agency at Kimbrel\u2019s age. But he tweaked his style and had a 2.38 ERA in the next four years. Big-money mistakes come in drastically different sizes. When you\u2019re wrong about a $250\u00a0million to $330 million contract, it\u2019s a decade-long anchor. But for one-fifth of \u201cHarper money,\u201d the Nats can make a very good run at Kimbrel and seriously improve their chances of making noise in the next three Octobers. And after staring at that empty locker between Doolittle and Rosenthal, I think the Nats should \u2014 gulp \u2014 Doo the Right Thing.","125":"Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced last month that Hungary needs more children. But only Hungarian ones, of course. Orban is staunchly anti-immigrant, so his government\u2019s solution to the country\u2019s declining population was to permanently abolish the income tax for Hungarian women who have at least four children. The Orban government, as it tends to do, put up billboards to promote its campaign. One billboard featured a young and in-love couple. They looked oddly familiar. Viewers of this billboard who spend too much time on the Internet will instantly recognize this young man and woman as the stars of the series of stock photos that gave us the \u201cdistracted boyfriend\u201d meme. For those blissfully unaware, the meme is typically used on social media to poke fun at various manifestations of the fleeting nature of human loyalty. For example: \u201cThis was such a perfect faux pas,\u201d Zselyke Csaky, research director for Europe and Eurasia at the nonprofit Freedom House, wrote in an email. \u201cOne of the reaction memes had \u2018emigration to London\u2019 written over the original distracted boyfriend meme, which kind of demonstrates young Hungarians approach to the issue.\u201d  The meme becomes a billboard, and the billboard, in turn, becomes a meme.","126":"Global and domestic economic concerns continue to drive down mortgage rates. According to the latest data released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate average slipped to 4.28 percent with an average 0.4 point. (Points are fees paid to a lender equal to 1 percent of the loan amount.) It was 4.31 percent a week ago and 4.45 percent a year ago. The 15-year fixed-rate average fell to 3.71 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 3.76 percent a week ago and 3.91 percent a year ago. The five-year adjustable rate average was unchanged at 3.84 percent with an average 0.3 point. It was 3.68 percent a year ago. \u201cMortgage rates fell this week and have yet to account for yesterday\u2019s Fed's announcement,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. \u201cLooking ahead to next week, we could see rates fall even further based on the decision to hold rates steady combined with guidance that emphasized patience.\u201d  The Federal Reserve did not increase its benchmark rate Wednesday and signaled it would not hike rates this year, a sign the central bank is concerned about a slowing economy. The Fed\u2019s retreat comes amid a slowdown in Europe and China, the uncertain status of Brexit and indications of lower spending by U.S. consumers and businesses. The Fed does not set mortgage rates, but its decisions influence them. The news caused bond yields to stumble but came too late to be factored into Freddie Mac\u2019s survey. The federally chartered mortgage investor aggregates rates from 125 lenders from across the country to come up with national average mortgage rates. With investors seeking the safety of long-term assets such as bonds, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.54 percent, its lowest level of the year. \u201cAfter a quiet start to a week that was light on market-moving economic data releases and geopolitical developments, bond yields moved sharply downward after the Fed signaled that additional hikes to its benchmark rate were unlikely to occur this year and that it will stop the reduction of its balance sheet in the fall,\u201d said Matthew Speakman, Zillow economic analyst. \u201cThese developments almost certainly mean mortgage rates will be moving even lower in the coming days after remaining in a narrow range and hovering around 14-month lows for most of the past couple of months.\u201d  Hale and Speakman aren\u2019t the only ones predicting rates will continue to drop. Bankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage rate trend index, found that three-quarters of the experts it surveyed say rates will go down in the coming week. Logan Mohtashami, senior loan officer at AMC Lending Group, is predicting lower rates. \u201cEven though we have had no bond volatility whatsoever recently and oil prices are above 60 today, a pullback in stocks could drive yields lower if the stock market feels the China trade deal might take longer,\u201d Mohtashami said. Meanwhile, mortgage applications were higher this week, according to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. The market composite index \u2014 a measure of total loan application volume \u2014 increased 1.6 percent from a week earlier. The refinance index climbed 4 percent from the previous week, while the purchase index ticked up 0.3 percent. The refinance share of mortgage activity accounted for 39.2 percent of all applications. \u201cWith rates for most loan types last week dropping to levels not seen since early 2018, refinance activity increased 3.5 percent from a year ago,\u201d said Bob Broeksmit, MBA president and CEO. \u201cPurchase activity also grew modestly \u2014 up 1 percent from last year \u2014 and has now risen year-over-year for five straight weeks.\u201d  More Real Estate:  If you\u2019re self-employed or a \u2018gig\u2019 worker, getting a mortgage just got easier Your FICO score doesn\u2019t always preordain your mortgage chances Large breach of mortgage borrowers\u2019 data raises new concerns, questions","127":"Gary Cohn, President Trump\u2019s former top economic adviser, says the president is \u201cdesperate\u201d to reach a trade deal with China and is being ill-served by protectionist advisers who have left the White House \u201cliving in chaos\u201d on major decisions. \u201cThe president needs a win,\u201d Cohn said in an interview with Freakonomics, a public radio show and podcast. Trump expects a China deal to boost the stock market, which has treaded water for the past year, the former aide said. Cohn cast doubt on the president\u2019s ability to obtain fundamental changes in China\u2019s state-led economic system, one of his core negotiating objectives. \u201cI think market access, the Chinese will give because they\u2019ve been close to giving it for a while. But how are we going to stop the Chinese from stealing intellectual property or not paying for it?\u201d he said. \u201cHow are we going to stop them from copyright infringement? What is the enforcement mechanism, and what are the punitive damages if they don\u2019t stop?\u201d The United States has proposed enforcing any agreement via 18 annual meetings with Chinese officials, backed by the threat of unilateral American tariffs, according to Robert E. Lighthizer, the chief U.S. trade negotiator. At the White House on Wednesday, the president told reporters he is \u201cnot in a hurry\u201d to reach a deal with Beijing and said \u201cthere\u2019s always a chance\u201d the talks could fail. But he also has expressed an eagerness to host a signing summit at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida for Chinese President Xi Jinping. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday that the president should \u201chave the guts to walk away\u201d if the Chinese don\u2019t offer significant concessions. Cohn, 58, the former president of Goldman Sachs, served for 14 months as Trump\u2019s director of the National Economic Council. He cited the 2017 passage of a $1.5 trillion corporate and personal income tax cut as his principal accomplishment, though he said it would be several years before the measure\u2019s success or failure becomes evident. A self-described \u201cglobalist\u201d in a nationalist White House, Cohn argued against the president\u2019s enthusiasm for imposing tariffs on products such as solar panels and steel. But he was often bested by White House adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, the administration\u2019s leading protectionists. \u201cI was losing the war on tariffs every day with the president. I knew I wasn\u2019t convincing him I was right,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not going to take a 74-year-old man who\u2019s believed something since he was 30 and convince him that I was right. Believe me, I tried.\u201d Cohn resigned in March 2018, shortly after the president abruptly announced 25 percent tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. In the Freakonomics interview, he said the president acted after Navarro and Ross circumvented normal channels to arrange a meeting between Trump and industry chief executives. Trump announced his decision to reporters at that White House meeting. \u201cThey created that meeting without anyone knowing it,\u201d Cohn said, adding that White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly had been blindsided by the move. \u201cWhen the process breaks down, then you\u2019re sort of, in my mind, living in chaos.\u201d Cohn disparaged Navarro as the \u201conly\u201d PhD economist in the world who supports the widespread use of tariffs. Cohn said he supported the president\u2019s desire to crack down on unfair Chinese trade practices, but he said tariffs \u201cdon\u2019t work.\u201d As evidence, he pointed to last year\u2019s record $891 billion trade deficit in merchandise and the record $419 billion gap in trade with China. \u201cSo tariffs were used as the threat. Did it hurt the Chinese at all? We had record trade deficits,\u201d Cohn said. Once seen as a leading candidate to replace Janet L. Yellen as Federal Reserve chair, Cohn fell out of favor with Trump after he criticized the president\u2019s handling of the August 2017 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville. But Cohn told Freakonomics that he would not have been a good fit as central bank chief, which he likened to an academic position debating the finer points of the U.S. economy. \u201cThat would be the worst position you could give to Gary Cohn,\u201d he said. \u201cI would not have been good at that job.\u201d Trump has frequently criticized his eventual appointee as Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, who took office in February 2018, for raising interest rates in the absence of significant inflation. With the Fed now having paused its campaign of rate hikes, Cohn was asked whether Powell had caved to presidential pressure. \u201cI surely hope, and I almost pray, that what the Fed did was in reaction to what they were seeing in the data, that they felt that there was an actual slowing of the economy and they were in the wrong place,\u201d he said.","128":"A Quinnipiac University poll Tuesday carried this striking top-line number: 64 percent of Americans believe President Trump committed crimes before he became president. And 45 percent say they think he committed crimes while serving in the Oval Office. In that same poll, however, only 35 percent favor starting the impeachment process, and many more \u2014 59 percent \u2014 oppose it. In other words, there is a sizable chunk of the American electorate that thinks we have a criminal as president but would rather not entertain removing him from office. (And to be clear: The question wasn\u2019t even about removing him from office; it was about merely beginning the impeachment process.) Welcome to the Democrats\u2019 impeachment dilemma. As a number of Democratic probes of the Trump administration and Trump\u2019s personal and business dealings get off the ground, it\u2019s worth taking stock of just how high a bar the American people have \u2014 and have had \u2014 for impeachment. There is a sense among some that if Robert S. Mueller III or federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York find Trump to have committed crimes (whether a campaign finance violation, collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice), that might be the end of him. Or at least it might be the beginning of his impeachment. But that\u2019s far from a certainty. We\u2019ve seen a similar disconnect with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). Over the weekend, he said that \u201cit\u2019s very clear that the president obstructed justice.\u201d But then, in almost the same breath, he said that \u201cimpeachment\u2019s a long way down the road.\u201d So obstruction apparently isn\u2019t sufficient? The standard for impeachment, of course, isn\u2019t just any crime; it\u2019s \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d Exactly what that means is in the eye of the beholder, and it\u2019s often been said that impeachment is a political remedy to a legal issue. It\u2019s basically a standard that is decided on by the American people, as reflected by their elected members of Congress. History suggests that committing crimes \u2014 even as president, and even if they are numerous \u2014 may not be sufficient in the minds of the public. Back when Bill Clinton was impeached in the late 1990s, a Harris Poll asked whether a lie was sufficient for removing him from office, or whether he needed to have \u201ccommitted a serious criminal offense.\u201d Seventy-two percent required a \u201cserious criminal offense.\u201d A Gallup poll around the same time asked whether, if people became convinced that Clinton had obstructed justice, he should be removed from office. The public was split, with 49 percent saying that would not be sufficient. The same question was asked about Clinton lying under oath in his testimony to the grand jury. In that scenario, 50 percent favored removal, but 46 percent said it wasn\u2019t enough. In both cases, about half the country shrugged off obstruction of justice and perjury, even if they were proved. Clinton, of course, wound up being accused of both by Kenneth Starr, who listed 11 impeachable offenses in what came to be known as the Starr Report. He was impeached, but the votes in the Senate weren\u2019t there for removal. (Interestingly, polls at the time also showed people didn\u2019t want Clinton charged for perjury and obstruction even after he left office. A CBS News\/New York Times poll in December 1998 showed they preferred 54 percent to 33 percent that he not face criminal charges. A later Los Angeles Times poll showed 57 percent didn\u2019t want Starr to indict Clinton once out of office.) If there\u2019s one takeaway from that era, it\u2019s that people don\u2019t necessarily like impeachment as a remedy for even proven wrongdoing, even when it pertains to what might be actual crimes. Whether Trump will ultimately get the same treatment is unclear. There are some key differences. Chief among them is that the crimes some allege Trump to have committed pertain to his actual election and to conduct related to his official actions as president, whereas Clinton\u2019s pertained to a personal affair that many people thought wasn\u2019t the public\u2019s business. Another is that Clinton had engendered lots of goodwill with his presidency and was broadly popular, which is not something Trump has ever been able to say. It\u2019s quite possible that the impeachment bar for Trump will be lower, even if it\u2019s not registering in polls just yet. But he\u2019s also got something else around that corner that could shield him from impeachment fever, and that\u2019s the 2020 election. Voters are already hearing from Democrats eager to take Trump on, and this is all something that could ultimately just be decided by voters in 20 months\u2019 time. That might not be soon enough for Trump\u2019s most ardent critics, but it might be for those in the middle whose support would be critical for any impeachment effort. They may just reason that, however obvious Trump\u2019s crimes might be, it would be better to deal with them in an election context than a fraught impeachment proceeding. In some ways, House Democratic leaders who are wary of impeachment may just need to run the clock a little. The details matter hugely here, but the public already appears to be setting a relatively high bar for Trump\u2019s impeachment. And this poll suggests that hush-money payments and obstruction of justice may not suffice.","129":"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) campaigns in Las Vegas on Sunday.\u00a0(John Locher\/AP) THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0Barack Obama opposed reparations for the descendants of slavery when he ran for president. He warned the NAACP in 2007 that they would be used as \u201can excuse for some to say we\u2019ve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work\u201d of enforcing anti-discrimination laws, improving public education, rehabilitating young men coming out of prisons and lifting people out of poverty. In 2016, neither Hillary Clinton nor Bernie Sanders supported reparations for the black community as a redress for slavery. Even as he promised a revolution of democratic socialism that would include tuition-free college and Medicare-for-all, Sanders said paying reparations to African Americans was a bridge too far. \u201cFirst of all, its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond of all, I think it would be very divisive.\u201d But this is not your father\u2019s Democratic Party, and it\u2019s not 2016 anymore.  Four declared Democratic presidential candidates have signaled support for some form of reparations to specifically benefit African Americans: Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Juli\u00e1n Castro and Marianne Williamson. This puts more pressure on the rest of the crowded field to endorse race-conscious policies and could provide fresh fodder for President Trump to portray his 2020 challengers as outside the mainstream. In the modern political sense, the term \u201creparations\u201d is a little like \u201csocialism.\u201d It means very different things to different people, and the devil is in the details. Many think of direct cash payments to African Americans when they hear the word. Others think more broadly of investments that are specifically made by the government to lift communities of color. What one person calls reparations someone else might just describe as strengthening the social safety net. The fact that candidates are willing to use the term at all after generations of Democratic standard-bearers have seemed allergic to it reflects a sea change. Like other issues where the Democratic Party is lurching leftward lately, such as the widespread embrace of the Green New Deal, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is once again driving the pace car. She expressed support for exploring the idea of reparations last month, using the pulpit that has come with her celebrity to move the issue to the front burner. \u201cPeople think reparations is reparations for slavery, but really, economically speaking, reparations are for the damage done by the New Deal and redlining because that is where we saw a compounding of the existing inequity from the legacy of slavery, where we drew red lines around black communities,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u00a0-- Warren (D-Mass.) on Thursday became the latest candidate to jump on the reparations bandwagon. \u201cWe must confront the dark history of slavery and government-sanctioned discrimination in this country that has had many consequences, including undermining the ability of black families to build wealth in America for generations,\u201d the senator said in a statement to the New York Times. \u201cWe need systemic, structural changes to address that.\u201d -- Castro expressed openness to reparations in an interview with the Root, a publication that caters to an African American audience, that also published yesterday. \u201cI have long thought that this country would be better off if we did find a way to do that,\u201d said the former secretary of housing and urban development. \u201cI don\u2019t find the notion challenging. What I do find challenging is the best way to do that.\u201d -- Harris (D-Calif.) said \u201cyes\u201d last week when asked explicitly whether she supports \u201csome form of reparations for black people.\u201d \u201cWell, look, I think that we have got to address that,\u201d the senator said during an appearance on \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d a radio show popular with African Americans. \u201cAgain, it goes back to the inequities. \u2026 We have got to recognize that and give people a lift up. And there are a number of ways to do it.\u201d Harris mentioned a bill she\u2019s introduced called the LIFT Act to help people making less than $100,000 a year. \u201cWhat I want to do about rent is the same thing,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat we need to do around education and understanding disparities. What we need to do around [historically black colleges and universities]. But we have a history of racism in America.\u201d -- The Democrat who has been most specific is Williamson, a spiritual guru who is waging a spirited long-shot campaign for the nomination that\u2019s been capturing more attention recently. \u201cWilliamson traces many of our nation\u2019s psychic wounds to slavery, for which she believes we need to make reparations in the form of a $100 billion, 10-year investment disseminated by a panel of black leaders across fields,\u201d Anna Peele writes in a profile that will run in our magazine this Sunday. \u201cWhen I wonder, sitting at a table in a Los Angeles neighborhood where the average home sells for $1.66 million, how she will enact her plan for reparations without seeming like a well-meaning white lady, Williamson crosses her arms and starts clomping the heel of her left foot like a dressage horse,\u201d Peele reports. \u201c\u2018I am a well-meaning white lady,\u2019 she says, utterly exasperated. \u2018Why should I apologize for being a well-meaning white lady? What is going on in this world today? I shouldn\u2019t apologize for being white any more than you should apologize for being black.\u2019 (I am not black, just another well-meaning white lady.) \u2018I\u2019ve been leading ritualized apologies \u2014 prayers of apology \u2014 from whites to blacks for over 20 years. I wrote a book [\u2018Healing the Soul of America\u2019] on this topic. This is not something that I just came new to. I was talking about this long before it was trending.\u2019\u201d Elizabeth Warren talks with a voter in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Feb. 10. (Charlie Neibergall\/AP) -- \u201cOther Democratic 2020 candidates \u2026 either did not respond to requests for comment or stopped short of an endorsement of reparations. Instead, several laid out policies that, though not intended as a redress for slavery, would benefit black Americans,\u201d Astead Herndon writes in today\u2019s Times. \u201cSenator Cory Booker\u2019s \u2018baby bonds\u2019 policy aims to help poorer children by giving them a government-funded savings account that could total up to $50,000 for the lowest income brackets. \u2026 And Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has endorsed a proposal to allow Americans without checking accounts to bank at the local post office; a disproportionate percentage of America\u2019s unbanked population are people of color. \u201cThe Warren campaign declined to give further details on [her statement endorsing reparations], but it came amid her calls for the federal government to provide special home-buying assistance to residents of communities that were adversely affected by \u2018redlining,\u2019 the discriminatory practice of denying mortgages, usually in poor and nonwhite areas. She also announced a sweeping universal child-care proposal that could strongly benefit minority communities that often have limited early childhood services.\u201d As people noted how relatively vague the quotes were from Harris and Warren, Herndon tweeted that he \u201cmade it clear to campaigns that \u2018policies that help black people\u2019 did not count as reparations, but would have to be intentionally race-specific and meant to address past harms \u2013 not lift all boats.\u201d He added that the Harris campaign did nothing to walk back her comments on \u201cThe Breakfast Club.\u201d \u201cWe have to be honest that people in this country do not start from the same place or have access to the same opportunities,\u201d Harris said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m serious about taking an approach that would change policies and structures and make real investments in black communities.\u201d -- Overwhelming majorities of Americans have consistently been opposed to the concept of reparations. Polling analyst Emily Guskin notes that the most recent survey she could find, a Point Taken-Marist poll from 2016, found that 68 percent said the U.S. government should not pay the descendants of slaves and that 72 percent said the U.S. should not pay African Americans in general. Racial differences were significant: 81 percent of whites opposed giving any monetary compensation to descendants of slaves, compared with 35 percent of African Americans and 47 percent of Latinos. A Kaiser-CNN poll from 2015 found 77 percent said the U.S. should not pay descendants of slaves, also with large differences by race. Even when the questions were worded slightly differently, the findings have been relatively similar and stayed somewhat consistent over the past few decades. A 2002 survey by Gallup, CNN and USA Today found 81 percent said the government should not make cash payments to black Americans who are descendants of slaves. A 1997 ABC poll found 77 percent believed the federal government should not pay black Americans whose ancestors were slaves. -- Bottom line: Get ready to hear the r-word a lot on the campaign trail over the next 20 months, mainly from Republicans who will use it to try painting Democrats as far-left and out-of-touch extremists.  Offering a taste of what\u2019s sure to come, Tucker Carlson devoted an entire segment of his show on Fox News last night to ripping Democrats over reparations. The host even quipped that Warren might be endorsing the idea because she is \u201cunder the influence of peyote,\u201d a drug associated with Native Americans. His guest, conservative commentator Mark Steyn, went further. He said it\u2019s \u201cdisturbing\u201d that the idea is becoming a \u201cmainstream\u201d position. \u201cSlavery was abolished a century and a half ago,\u201d Steyn said on Fox. \u201cNobody alive today has a grandparent who was a slave. And, in that sense, I think you reach a point where you need to move on. The reparations thing eventually, as the decades goes by, becomes ridiculous.\u201d Barack Obama hugs Golden State Warriors basketball player Stephen Curry on Tuesday night in Oakland, Calif. (Jeff Chiu\/AP) -- Based on the polls and the mood of the country, it seems like a safe bet that any Democrat who endorses the concept of reparations right now \u2013 however generically \u2013 will face immense political pressure to walk back their comments \u2013 at least somewhat \u2013 in the context of a general election. -- During an interview in his final year as president, Obama expounded at length on why endorsing reparations is bad politics.\u00a0\u201cIt is easy to make that theoretical argument,\u201d Obama told Ta-Nehisi Coates, an outspoken advocate for reparations, during an interview that appeared in the Atlantic. \u201cBut as a practical matter, it is hard to think of any society in human history in which a majority population has said that as a consequence of historic wrongs, we are now going to take a big chunk of the nation\u2019s resources over a long period of time to make that right. \u201cYou can look at examples like postwar Germany, where reparations were paid to Holocaust victims and families, but they lost the war,\u201d Obama added.\u00a0\u201cSmall population, finite amount of money that it was going to cost. Not multiple generations but people, in some cases, who are still alive, who can point to, \u2018That was my house. Those were my paintings. Those were my mother\u2019s family jewels.\u2019 If you look at countries like South Africa, where you had a black majority, there have been efforts to tax and help that black majority, but it hasn\u2019t come in the form of a formal reparations program. You have countries like India that have tried to help untouchables, with essentially affirmative-action programs, but it hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed the structure of their societies. So the bottom line is that it\u2019s hard to find a model in which you can practically administer and sustain political support for those kinds of efforts. \u201cAnd what makes America complicated as well is the degree to which this is not just a black\/white society, and it is becoming less so every year,\u201d the then-president continued.\u00a0\u201cSo how do Latinos feel if there\u2019s a big investment just in the African American community, and they\u2019re looking around and saying, \u2018We\u2019re poor as well. What kind of help are we getting?\u2019 Or Asian Americans who say, \u2018Look, I\u2019m a first-generation immigrant, and clearly I didn\u2019t have anything to do with what was taking place.\u2019 And now you start getting into trying to calibrate. \u2026 \u201cI\u2019m not so optimistic as to think that you would ever be able to garner a majority of an American Congress that would make those kinds of investments above and beyond the kinds of investments that could be made in a progressive program for lifting up all people,\u201d he concluded.\u00a0\u201cSo to restate it: I have much more confidence in my ability, or any president or any leader\u2019s ability, to mobilize the American people around a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment to help every child in poverty in this country than I am in being able to mobilize the country around providing a benefit specific to African Americans as a consequence of slavery and Jim Crow. Now, we can debate the justness of that. But I feel pretty confident in that assessment politically.\u201d WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: Schoolchildren walk by as U.S. troops patrol in Syria near the Turkish border in November. (Rodi Said\/Reuters) -- The White House announced that the United States will leave behind\u00a0200 \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d troops in Syria\u00a0for an unspecified amount of time beyond the planned withdrawal of American forces this spring. Karen DeYoung and Missy Ryan report: \u201cA U.S. official ... said that the 200 would be 'split down the middle' between Syrian Kurdish-controlled areas in the northeast of the country, and the Tanf garrison in southeast Syria. The official said the total might rise slightly. The decision was a partial reversal of President Trump\u2019s order, announced in December, that all 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria would leave, since their mission to destroy the Islamic State caliphate, in his view, had been achieved. Complete withdrawal was expected by the end of April. ...\u00a0Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) praised the move Thursday and said that the residual U.S. force would 'ensure that ISIS does not return and that Iran does not fill the vacuum that would have been left if we completely withdrew.'\u00a0It also ensures, he said, that Turkey and the Syrian Kurds 'will not go into conflict.'\" Mark Harris testifies Thursday during a hearing on voting irregularities in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District. (Travis Long\/Raleigh\u00a0News & Observer\/AP) -- North Carolina elections officials\u00a0ordered a new contest in the 9th Congressional District after a months-long investigation into alleged ballot tampering. Amy Gardner reports: \u201cThe board voted unanimously to throw out the November results between Republican Mark Harris and Democrat Dan McCready after Harris, an evangelical minister from Charlotte, admitted under oath that he was mistaken in his testimony earlier in the day. Harris blamed the error on a recent sepsis infection that he said caused two strokes and affected his memory. \u2026 Harris was under scrutiny for hiring a political operative, Leslie McCrae Dowless, who allegedly assembled a crew of election workers to illegally collect, fill out and forge mail-in ballots in two rural counties in the 9th District. \u2026 \u201cThursday\u2019s abrupt bipartisan conclusion to what had been a deeply rancorous process offered hope to some who believe the kind of fraud alleged in the 9th District often goes undetected and unprosecuted \u2014 leaving rural and often impoverished communities without fair elections or representation. \u2026 Later, the board will set a date for a new election, probably including primaries. McCready has begun preparing for a new election and is expected to run again. It appeared less likely that Harris, who had led in unofficial returns by 905 votes, would do so.\u201d -- Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said he has nothing to apologize for and plans to run for reelection despite the controversy over his history of racist remarks that has gotten him stripped of his committee assignments in Congress. The Des Moines Register\u2019s Tony Leys reports: \u201cKing confirmed that he will run for re-election in 2020, despite drawing three challengers for the Republican nomination. He offered a message to voters in his northwest Iowa district: \u2018Don\u2019t let the elitists in this country, the power brokers in this country, tell you who\u2019s going to represent you in the United States Congress.\u2019\u00a0 \u201cKing blamed his troubles on media outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, which he accused of twisting his words and \u2018weaponizing\u2019 the language. \u2018If you would just hold these publications to what is true, there is no story whatsoever,\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2026 There\u2019s no part of me that believes in anything that\u2019s advocated by folks that identify themselves as white nationalists or white supremacy.\u2019\u201d  The congressman also said he doesn\u2019t think being on a committee matters much since the House is controlled by the Democrats: \u201c\u2018If there\u2019s ever going to be a time not to have committee assignments, this time with Nancy Pelosi as the speaker of the House is the time,\u2019 he said.\u201d Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta waits for President Trump to speak at the White House. (Salwan Georges\/The Washington Post) -- A federal judge in Florida ruled that a 2007 plea deal between Jeffrey Epstein, a politically connected billionaire accused of molesting dozens of young girls,\u00a0and federal prosecutors in Miami, including Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, violated the law. Mark Berman reports: \u201cThe ruling was a stinging rebuke for prosecutors and how they behaved in a grim, high-profile case that has drawn increased scrutiny in recent months. A\u00a0Miami Herald investigation\u00a0last year highlighted the allegations and Acosta\u2019s role in cutting a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein, while a Justice Department office said it is exploring whether the federal prosecutors who reached the deal committed \u2018professional misconduct.\u2019 ...\u00a0 \u201cDistrict Judge Kenneth A. Marra was blunt, ruling that prosecutors had acted improperly in reaching the agreement with Epstein \u2014 which stopped federal action in exchange for him pleading guilty to a state charge \u2014 without telling the victims. Marra, based in West Palm Beach, Fla., wrote in a 33-page ruling that the actions violated the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act (CVRA), which entitles victims to know about significant events in their cases. Marra wrote that he was \u2018not ruling that the decision not to prosecute was improper,\u2019 noting he was \u2018simply ruling that, under the facts of this case, there was a violation of the victims rights under the CVRA'\u201d Acosta\u2019s spokesman at the Labor Department pointed to the Justice Department\u2019s long-standing defense of how prosecutors handled the case. \u201cFor more than a decade, the actions of the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of Florida in this case have been defended by the Department of Justice in litigation across three administrations and several attorneys general,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe office\u2019s decisions were approved by departmental leadership and followed departmental procedures.\u201d\u00a0The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of Florida, which Acosta led between 2005 and 2009, declined to comment.

Larry Hogan (R), who is flirting with a challenge to Trump in 2020, accused the Republican National Committee of taking \u201cunprecedented\u201d steps to shield the president from primary challengers. Ovetta Wiggins reports: \u201cHogan, who is being courted by Republican dissidents seeking an alternative to Trump, told Politico in an interview that he was disgusted by RNC efforts to close ranks around Trump and troubled by reports that Republicans in South Carolina were considering scrapping their primary altogether. \u2018I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, and I\u2019ve been involved in the Republican Party for most of my life,\u2019 Hogan told Politico reporter Alex Isenstadt. \u2018In my opinion, it\u2019s not the way we should be going about our politics.\u2019\u201d Why you should take this seriously: Hogan will take over as chairman of the National Governors Association during its meeting in D.C. this weekend. That gives him a bigger platform when\u00a0he travels to Iowa early next month, where he\u2019ll probably\u00a0hold meetings with activists and political types.

Christopher Hasson, who was allegedly plotting a domestic terrorism attack, was caught after he conducted suspicious searches using government computers to study the manifestos and methods of mass shooters.\u00a0He was arrested\u00a0at work last Friday\u00a0after being detected by an internal Coast Guard program that watches for any \u201cinsider threat.\u201d\u00a0Lynh Bui, Dan Lamothe and Michael Miller report:\u00a0\u201cThe program identified suspicious computer activity tied to Hasson, prompting the agency\u2019s investigative service to launch an investigation last fall, said Lt. Cmdr. Scott McBride, a service spokesman. ... He researched how to carry out sniper attacks, [prosecutors] contend, and whether rifle scopes were illegal. \u2026 As he built an arsenal, prosecutors contend, Hasson read manifestos by the Unabomber, the Virginia Tech shooter and the Olympic Park bomber among other domestic mass shooters, and also looked for guidance to the plot of right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik, who in 2011 unleashed two attacks in Norway that killed 77 people. \u2026 And all the while, investigators assert, he was amassing a cache of weapons.\u201d\u00a0He also had a secret-level clearance. \u201cHasson\u2019s federal public defender, Julie Stelzig, said \u2026 there was \u2018no actual indication of any plan.\u2019 She said that Hasson had no prior record and that the number of weapons he had were \u2018modest at best\u2019 for average gun collectors. \u2018It\u2019s not a crime to think negative thoughts,\u2019 Stelzig said ...\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s not a crime to think about doomsday scenarios.\u2019\u201d -- Tennessee Gov.

Bethonie Butler, Sonia Rao and Alex Horton report: \u201cSmollett\u2019s bond was set at $100,000 at a court hearing Thursday afternoon, during which Cook County Circuit Court Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. also directed Smollett to surrender his passport. \u2026 Prosecutors have identified the [two men Smollett allegedly paid to attack him] as brothers Abimbola \u2018Abel\u2019 Osundairo and Olabinjo \u2018Ola\u2019 Osundairo. They say Smollett and Abel Osundairo were close friends who worked together on \u2018Empire,\u2019 where Abel was a stand-in for a love interest of Smollett\u2019s character, Jamal Lyon. Prosecutors also say Abel had been \u2018a source of designer drugs\u2019 including molly, a form of MDMA, for Smollett since spring 2018. They say Smollett met Ola Osundairo, who appeared as an extra on \u2018Empire,\u2019 \u2018on several occasions through Abel.\u2019 \u201cAt a media briefing Thursday morning, Chicago police said Smollett concocted the story of a brutal hate crime because he was \u2018dissatisfied with his salary\u2019 on the Fox drama. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the department has a $3,500 check Smollett paid the men to help him stage the fake attack after a crude, threatening letter he sent to the \u2018Empire\u2019 set in Chicago failed to get attention. Johnson was remarkably forceful in his remarks about the case, which has gained widespread media attention since Smollett told police he was attacked in the city last month. Johnson, a black Chicago native, said the actor \u2018took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.\u2019 ... \u201cProsecutors allege that Smollett, 36, was the guiding force behind the staged attack \u2014 right down to the intersection where it took place. They say Smollett told the Osundairo brothers, who are of Nigerian descent, to call his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs, and say, \u2018This is MAGA country.\u2019 They also say Smollett provided a $100 bill for supplies including rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball hats resembling the \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 hats associated with [Trump\u2019s] campaign. According to prosecutors, Smollett coordinated the plan around a trip the brothers had planned to Nigeria.\u201d -- Trump said Smollett \u201cinsulted\u201d his supporters with the fake attack. \u201c@JussieSmollett - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA,\u201d the president wrote in a tweet. -- Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.) said Smollett\u2019s allegedly fake attack made it harder for real hate-crime victims to be believed. Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201cLate last month, when Smollett first told Chicago police that he was attacked, Rush sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray asking for a hate crimes investigation into the incident. On Thursday, the Illinois Democrat said that it is now clear that the attack \u2018was a total and complete lie.\u2019 \u2018I am beyond disappointed and extremely infuriated at Smollett\u2019s brazen, devious, and disgraceful behavior,\u2019 Rush said in a statement. \u2026 \u2018I hope that Smollett is aware that his stunt has made it harder for real victims to be believed and has caused them to relive their victimization, both from being attacked and from having their stories called into question,\u2019 he said.\u201d -- Smollett\u2019s case put some 2020 candidates in a tight spot after\u00a0they quickly decried what they at first thought was a homophobic, hate-filled attack. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: \u201cAfter Smollett reported the alleged attack to police in January, weighing it with political import by claiming his assailants chanted President Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, Democratic Sens. Kamala D. Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand quickly decried what they deemed a clear hate crime. Smollett\u2019s case, Harris and Booker said in separate tweets, was an attempted \u2018modern day lynching,\u2019 while Gillibrand called it \u2018a sickening and outrageous attack. But as questions began to emerge about Smollett\u2019s account, the three Democratic contenders faced uncomfortable questions about whether they were too quick to make a judgment and utter words of condemnation.\" -- Despite his arrest, Smollett was back at work on \u201cEmpire\u201d last night.\u00a0The New York Times's John Koblin reports: \u201cThere are still two episodes left to be shot over the next month for the show\u2019s fifth season ... When Mr. Smollett returned to work on Thursday he was prepared to film scenes from the season\u2019s second-to-last episode ... It is still an open question whether Fox will use the footage when the episodes ultimately air. 'Empire' has not yet been renewed for a sixth season, so its ultimate fate still hangs in the balance. ... Complicating matters is the fact that 20th Century Fox Television \u2014 the studio that produces 'Empire'\u00a0\u2014 is weeks away from being folded into the Walt Disney Company after Disney\u2019s deal to purchase many of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets finally closes.

(Ricky Carioti\/The Washington Post) THERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Gagged: A federal judge ordered\u00a0longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone to no\u00a0longer speak publicly about the case against him. Rachel Weiner and Manuel Roig-Franzia report: \u201cJudge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington said it would be \u2018foolhardy\u2019 to wait for Stone to transgress again in the wake of an Instagram post that appeared to show her photo near crosshairs. \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m not giving you another chance,\u2019 Jackson told Stone. \u2018I have serious doubts whether you\u2019ve learned any lesson at all.\u2019 If he violates the order in any way, Jackson warned, she will order him to jail. The judge, who sounded flabbergasted by Stone\u2019s explanations, rejected his claim that the image was not meant to be threatening. \u2018Roger Stone knows full well the power of words and the power of symbols. There is nothing ambiguous about crosshairs,\u2019 she said.\u00a0\u2026 \u201cStone took the stand during the hearing to apologize for the post \u2026 \u2018Thank you, but the apology rings quite hollow,\u2019 she said. \u2026 Both Jackson and prosecutor Jonathan Kravis grilled Stone on how he found the image and why he posted it. Stone gave inconsistent answers, saying first that it was posted by a volunteer and then that a volunteer sent him the image but he posted it himself. He said he can\u2019t remember who gave him the picture or the names of everyone who has access to his phone. \u2018How hard is it to find an image without crosshairs?\u2019 an incredulous Jackson asked Stone. \u2026 Jackson also repeatedly asked Stone why, if he immediately regretted the posting, he went on to defend it in media interviews. \u2026 Stone said the apology was drafted by his attorneys and signed by him during a doctor\u2019s appointment and that he had not read it carefully.\u201d -- An IRS analyst was charged with leaking government documents on financial transactions made by Trump\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen.

But such brevity is not necessarily good news for the president. In fact, quite the opposite. \u2026 The president\u2019s bashing of Mr. Mueller may induce him to issue a more limited, by-the-book report, which will spawn further investigation.

This was all a standard facet of the Trump intern orientation process, billed as an \u2018ethics training\u2019\u2014underscored by implicit legal threats from [Trump\u2019s] in-house lawyers. \u2026 To veterans of other administrations, the act of compelling interns to sign these types of NDAs would seem odd, if not downright unenforceable or legally dubious.\u201d -- A lobbying firm run by former Trump advisers is representing a Russian-backed U.S. energy company that has connections to a Chinese aluminum production company. From NBC News\u2019s Brian Schwartz: \u201cTurnberry Solutions, a lobbying group run by former Trump campaign advisor Jason Osborne, has signed American Ethane as a client, according to a new lobbying disclosure form. The filing was posted on the Senate lobbying disclosure website on Tuesday. The document shows that Osborne and Ryan O'Dwyer, who previously was a special assistant to the secretary of Agriculture and a senior public liaison to Trump's inaugural committee, will be the lobbyists representing American Ethane on trade and energy issues. American Ethane touts a contract it signed with the Nanshan Group, an aluminum production company based in China. The development also comes as the Trump administration is engaged in high-stakes trade talks with the Chinese government.\u201d Two men ask for information at the CSI Visa Processing headquarters in Durango, Mexico. (Luis Antonio Rojas for The Washington Post) THE IMMIGRATION WARS: -- The dwindling number of migrants trying to cross the southern border has had a severe impact on American farmers, who rely on undocumented immigrants for cheap labor. Kevin Sieff and Annie Gowen report: \u201cTo fill those positions, employers have turned to temporary visa programs that recruit workers in Mexico and Central America. Since 2016, the number of U.S. agricultural visas has grown from 165,000 to 242,000, a record high, according to the Labor Department. Amid an intractable debate over immigration and border security, America\u2019s labor force is quietly being transformed, as many employers see no choice but to shift from illegal to legal labor. \u2026 Despite his claim that immigrants take jobs away from Americans, [Trump] has touted the guest worker program, acknowledging the difficulty in finding American manual laborers and pledging to make it easier for farmers to hire workers legally.\u201d -- The Trump administration is advancing plans to withhold work permits from the spouses of high-skilled visa holders. The San Francisco Chronicle\u2019s Tal Kopan reports: \u201cAt issue are work permits for nearly 100,000 immigrants who are here with spouses working on a high-tech visa and seeking a green card. \u2026 In 2015, the Obama administration created the H-4 employment authorization document, or H-4 EAD as it\u2019s commonly known, to allow those spouses to work until the family can get green cards. \u2026 Since going into effect, there have been more than 90,000 immigrants approved for work permits under the program. [Trump] pledged early on to rescind the H-4 permit program, but the administration has been delayed in doing so.\u201d -- Fact check: Trump tweeted a video of construction at the border as evidence of his wall being built. But the video shows the replacement of existing fencing at the border. The New York Times\u2019s Michael Tackett reports: \u201cThe money for the steel-slatted barrier came from a congressional appropriation in 2017, not from newly authorized spending in the recent deal that averted a government shutdown, or from money the president is seeking to take from other federal projects under his national emergency declaration from last week.\u201d -- The end of an immigration relief program means hundreds of Liberians living in the U.S. will have to choose between becoming undocumented\u00a0or going back to Liberia, leaving their American children behind. Orion Donovan-Smith reports: Liberian immigrants \u201cwere given temporary permission to stay in the United States in 1999, when President Bill Clinton implemented \u2018deferred enforced departure.\u2019 DED was routinely extended by previous administrations but is set to end under Trump\u2019s effort to terminate programs for immigrants without permanent status \u2026 Without a change of heart from the president \u2014 or new legislation from Congress \u2014 Liberians living in the United States under DED will lose their work authorization and become subject to deportation. Instead of self-deporting, many are expected to stay in the United States in hopes of getting a hearing in immigration courts, a process that could take years.\u201d\u00a0 -- The ACLU wants the Trump administration to determine how many children were separated from their parents at the border, a request White House lawyers said would be hard to comply with. Maria Sacchetti and Tony Perry report:\u00a0The lawyers\u00a0\u201csaid it would be extremely difficult to retrace the steps of all children who were separated but then released to parents or vetted sponsors. Justice Department lawyer Scott Stewart said that reuniting the 2,700-plus children, who were in federal custody when he ordered the Trump administration to find their parents, had taken eight months. Going back to a larger group, he said, would \u2018blow the case into some other galaxy of a task.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 Federal judge Dana M. Sabraw, who last summer ordered the White House to return all separated children in federal custody to their parents, did not immediately rule on the request. But he\u00a0said it's critical to know where every child went: \u201cGovernment officials urged Sabraw in court filings to deny the ACLU\u2019s request, saying the children separated before his order already have been released from federal custody to a legal sponsor. Those children are \u2018in a different legal position\u2019 than those covered in the ACLU lawsuit, the government argued in court documents, adding that Sabraw should not allow the ACLU to \u2018move the goal posts at this late date.\u2019 \u2018The government has worked hard and in good faith over the last eight months to comply with the Court\u2019s orders and to facilitate the reunification process for class members,\u2019 the Justice Department said in a court filing.\u201d\u00a0 A man walks past boxes of USAID humanitarian aid at a warehouse on the outskirts of Cucuta, Colombia. (Fernando Vergara\/AP) THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- Opposition leaders in Venezuela predict\u00a0violence to break out tomorrow, when volunteers are expected to try to break President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s blockade of international relief. Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier report: \u201cMaduro on Thursday ordered the closure of the border with Brazil and weighed sealing the border with Colombia ... as his government scrambled to respond to the planned Saturday operation. \u2026 A month after opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 declared Maduro a usurper and claimed to be Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader, the government\u2019s enemies were in the midst of a risky gambit. By bus, car, boat, plane, motorbike and foot, thousands of Venezuelans, including Guaid\u00f3, were already mobilizing and heading toward the borders. Their plan: to force open Venezuela\u2019s doors by force of numbers.\u201d -- Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Venezuelan troops have started disobeying Maduro\u2019s orders. \u201cSaturday\u2019s a day when we\u2019re going to find a lot about the Maduro regime,\u201d Rubio said of the planned aid delivery this weekend. \u201cI have reason to believe that rank-and-file military are not going to violently suppress aid workers.\u201d (Bloomberg News) -- Venezuela's former chief of military intelligence declared his support for Guaid\u00f3, telling\u00a0Maduro, \"It's been more than enough.\"\u00a0The Wall Street Journal's Ryan Dube and Kejal Vyas report: \u201cHugo Carvajal, a retired general and current congressman for the ruling Socialist Party, called for authorities to allow into Venezuela the humanitarian aid that the U.S. is stockpiling on the Colombian border.\u00a0...\u00a0Mr. Carvajal, who spent more than three decades in Venezuela\u2019s military, also had a sobering message for active troops, many of whom have been appearing in propaganda videos meant to rile up nationalist sentiment against what the Maduro regime says is an imminent U.S. invasion.\u201d -- The vice president will travel to Colombia on Monday to meet with Latin American leaders about the deepening crisis in Venezuela. Anne Gearan reports: \u201cPence\u2019s office said he would \u2018voice the United States\u2019 unwavering support for [Guaid\u00f3] and highlight the Venezuelan people\u2019s fight for democracy over dictatorship.\u2019 The address to a diplomatic consortium known as the Lima Group comes as Guaid\u00f3 has promised a weekend mobilization against Maduro\u00a0and in support of delivery of food and medical supplies to Venezuelans facing severe shortages and hunger.\u201d -- An American detained in Russia on spy charges will be held for an extra three months.\u00a0Amie Ferris-Rotman reports: \u201cA Moscow court on Friday extended by three months custody of Paul Whelan, an American citizen charged with espionage, meaning he will stay behind bars through late May.\u00a0The request came from Russia\u2019s security services, who detained the 48-year-old former Marine in late December, seizing him at his Moscow hotel room during what his family described was a personal trip to see friends.\u00a0Whelan\u2019s lawyer, Vladi\u00admir Zherebenkov, had previously said his client was unwittingly handed a flash drive containing a 'state secret,' but no other official details have emerged in a case that has been dogged by murkiness and delays in standard procedure.\u201d\u00a0 -- A\u00a0U.S.-born woman who joined the Islamic State\u00a0and who the president said is not welcome back in America must be allowed to return home, a lawsuit filed on her behalf states.\u00a0Isaac Stanley-Becker reports: \u201cThe lawyer suing the U.S. government for her return says Hoda Muthana, 24, deserves more than a letter announcing her denaturalization. 'And certainly,\u2019 said Charles Swift, a former Navy commander and the director of the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America, 'more than a tweet.'\"\u00a0 -- China used American expertise from a Yale researcher and a Massachusetts firm\u00a0to create a system of surveillance that uses DNA to track down its own people. The New York Times's Sui-Lee Wee reports: \u201cChina wants to make the country\u2019s Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, more subservient to the Communist Party. It has detained up to a million people in what China calls 're-education'\u00a0camps, drawing condemnation from human rights groups and a threat of sanctions from the Trump administration.\u00a0Collecting genetic material is a key part of China\u2019s campaign, according to human rights groups and Uighur activists. They say a comprehensive DNA database could be used to chase down any Uighurs who resist conforming to the campaign. ...\u00a0 \u201cChina\u2019s campaign poses a direct challenge to the scientific community and the way it makes cutting-edge knowledge publicly available. The campaign relies in part on public DNA databases and commercial technology, much of it made or managed in the United States. In turn, Chinese scientists have contributed Uighur DNA samples to a global database, potentially violating scientific norms of consent.\u201d\u00a0Human rights groups are accusing the Chinese government of reportedly collecting other DNA samples through free medical checkups, a claim the government denies. -- In advance of another round of trade talks with China, Trump tweeted that he wanted \u201c5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Brian Fung explains whether 6G is even a thing: \u201cIf you have to ask, you are not alone: Searches for \u20186G\u2019 spiked on Google in the moments after Trump\u2019s tweet. The short answer is, 6G is likely what we\u2019ll call whatever advanced data networks come after 5G. And 5G is what carriers are currently building as the next generation after 4G LTE. But so far, 6G exists largely as a theoretical concept and is a long way from being deployed in the real world.\u201d -- Mitch McConnell has pressed Trump to nominate Kelly Craft, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, as the next U.N. ambassador. Axios\u2019s Jonathan Swan reports: \u201cLike McConnell, Craft is from Kentucky, where she and her husband, billionaire coal CEO Joe Craft, rank among the state's highest-profile Republican donors. She previously served as an alternate delegate in the U.S. delegation to the UN during the George W. Bush administration, specializing on the issue of U.S. engagement in Africa.\u201d\u00a0 Sen. Bernie Sanders refused to call Venezuelan leader\u00a0Nicol\u00e1s Maduro a dictator. (Andrew Harnik\/AP) MORE ON 2020: -- Florida Democrats criticized Bernie Sanders over his refusal to call\u00a0Maduro a dictator.\u00a0From Politico's Marc Caputo:\u00a0\u201cSanders also would not say whether he considered [opposition leader Guaid\u00f3] ...\u00a0the nation\u2019s interim president, which is the position of the United States and a majority of Latin American [and] European countries. ... 'He is not going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party. He has demonstrated again that he does not understand this situation,' [said]\u00a0Rep. Donna Shalala, a Miami Democrat who represents Venezuelan exiles ...\u00a0Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and former Vice President Joe Biden, however, have clearly stated they consider Maduro a dictator and Guaid\u00f3 the legitimate leader of Venezuela. And [Elizabeth Warren] said\u00a0that she believed Maduro was a dictator.\" -- Warren demanded to know how U.S.-made weapons were reportedly transferred from American allies to al-Qaeda-linked fighters, Iranian-backed rebels and hard-line Salafi militias on the ground in Yemen. Warren, a member of the Armed Services Committee, made the request in\u00a0a letter to acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,\u00a0CNN's Eliza Mackintosh reports. -- Bigger picture: The winner of the crowded Democratic primary could determine the trajectory of liberalism for years to come, Molly Ball and Philip Elliott write in a cover story for Time magazine: \u201cThe party\u2019s very identity is up for grabs, as a vast and historically diverse crop of candidates brings big, new ideas to a demanding, divided base. \u2026 Fittingly, it\u2019s women, minorities and younger candidates who have jumped into the race early, while many white male hopefuls remain on the sidelines, gauging the terrain. \u2026 As much as they would like to move away from white male dominance, some rank-and-file Democrats worry that doing so would hurt the party\u2019s chances against Trump. They fear that a woman or nonwhite candidate would be damaged by Trump\u2019s sexism and race-baiting. And to the party faithful, winning is everything.\u201d -- Barack Obama\u2019s political group,\u00a0Organizing for Action (OFA), is merging with the National Redistricting Action Fund, a group aimed at giving Democrats an edge in the redistricting process run by former attorney general Eric Holder. The Hill\u2019s Reid Wilson reports: The merger will give the newly created group \u201ccontrol of the vaunted list of supporters, donors and volunteers that Obama and his team built over more than a decade. \u2026 While the merger represents a transfer of one of the most valuable commodities in American politics, Holder said he would be legally precluded from using it for his own political purposes. Holder is still considering a run for president, a decision he said he would make in short order, and he said the merger is not an indication that he is leaning one way or the other.\u201d -- New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), another potential presidential candidate,\u00a0has turned against Amazon since the company reversed its decision to open a second headquarters in Queens, taking an offensive posture that could aid his potential presidential bid. The New York Times\u2019s William Neuman and J. David Goodman report: \u201cTaking a highly visible stand against a big corporation and its phenomenally wealthy chief executive, Jeff Bezos, could score points with the energized Democratic activists on the left who are likely to vote in primaries. It gives him a platform to discuss corporate behavior and income inequality, one of his core progressive issues. It provides an avenue for Mr. de Blasio to position himself on the campaign trail as a mayor who stood up to Amazon \u2014 even if he once stood alongside them.\u201d Bezos owns The Post. -- As they head into 2020, Democrats are seeking to recruit congressional candidates with fresh faces, interesting backgrounds \u2014 and short legislative records. From Paul Kane: \u201cIn the 2018 midterms, House Democrats had a smashing success with dozens of first-time candidates coming from the military, intelligence agencies and prosecutors\u2019 offices. \u2026 Democrats, in reviewing recent elections, privately contend that authenticity is the most important trait for victory, pointing to three incumbents who won in what should have been very tough races last year: Sens. Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and Jon Tester (Mont.). When it comes to flipping seats, however, Democrats have largely done so with relative newcomers.\u201d \u00a0 -- All\u00a02020 candidates except for Trump promised they will not use stolen data in the campaign. From the Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Stein, Jackie Kucinich and Scott Bixby: \u201cNearly three years after hacked materials upended the 2016 presidential campaign, every Democratic candidate running for the White House has pledged not to knowingly use such material should they end up being published during the current election cycle. \u2026 The Daily Beast asked each presidential campaign either up-and-running or in its exploratory phase whether they would commit to not knowingly using or referencing hacked material that appears online on grounds that it may have been obtained illegally. Each Democratic candidate responded with some form of commitment to not used hacked materials.\u201d -- Howard Schultz didn\u2019t vote in this month\u2019s Seattle school levies, a no-show vote that is in line with the former Starbucks CEO\u2019s pattern of ignoring elections despite urging Americans to become civically involved. From the Seattle Times\u2019s Jim Brunner: \u201cSchultz was asked about that record during an appearance in Seattle last month \u2026 He responded: \u2018I travel all over the world. It\u2019s not an excuse, but I have not been as engaged locally.\u2019 Asked Wednesday why he didn\u2019t vote on the latest school levies, even after facing scrutiny on the issue, Schultz, who was traveling in California, issued a brief statement through a spokeswoman. \u2018It would have been great to vote in every election, and I commend all of the Seattleites who have a 100% voting record. I didn\u2019t vote in every local election, but I am proud of Sheri\u2019s and my civic record in this community,\u2019 the statement said, referring to his wife.\u201d  -- The New Jersey Senate approved a bill to keep Trump off the 2020 ballot unless he releases his tax returns.\u00a0This is the second time Democrats in the state's Senate have tried to pass the controversial measure to block candidates from appearing on the ballot unless they make their returns public. The last time, then-Gov. Chris Christie (R) vetoed it. (NorthJersey.com) -- The New York Times's editorial-page editor, James Bennet, will recuse himself if his brother, Sen.

So, the CIA recruited a businessman to bait them,\u201d by Zach Dorfman: \u201cBeginning in 1975, a big black limousine with diplomatic plates would pull up once a month to the no-parking zone outside John Greenagel\u2019s office in the handsome Merchants Exchange Building in downtown San Francisco. A man would exit the car, paper bag in hand, and ascend the stairs to Greenagel\u2019s public relations firm. The man would hand Greenagel, then in his mid-30s, the paper bag, which always contained stale Cuban cigars and a bottle of Stolichnaya without a tax stamp. 'Compliments of Mr. Pavlov,' the man would say, and walk out. Yuri Pavlov was a diplomat based at the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco and an undercover KGB officer ... after the Soviet bag man left, Greenagel would call his CIA handler, who would pop over to his office; and they\u2019d laugh and drink the Stoly, smoke the old Cubans and talk about Greenagel\u2019s deepening friendship with Pavlov, which was entirely manufactured. ...

Despite promises of greater oversight following past advertising scandals, a Times review shows that Facebook has continued to allow advertisers to target hundreds of thousands of users the social media firm believes are curious about topics such as \u2018Joseph Goebbels,\u2019 \u2018Josef Mengele,\u2019 \u2018Heinrich Himmler,\u2019 the neo-nazi punk band Skrewdriver and Benito Mussolini\u2019s long-defunct National Fascist Party.

Health care, communications and technology companies took the heaviest losses, while financial, industrial and energy stocks notched gains. The market had veered lower early in the day after comments from a key U.S. trade negotiator stoked doubt over how much progress was being made on resolving the trade war between the U.S. and China. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told a panel of lawmakers that \u201cmuch still needs to be done\u201d before the U.S. and China can reach an agreement. China has offered to make major purchases of U.S. goods, such as soybeans and natural gas, in a bid to resolve the conflict, but Lighthizer said such steps wouldn\u2019t be enough. \u201cThe issues on the table are too serious to be resolved with promises of additional purchases,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need new rules.\u201d Investors were also keeping an eye on escalating international tensions. Pakistan said it shot down two Indian warplanes in the disputed region of Kashmir and captured a pilot. The incident worsened relations between the nuclear-armed rivals to a point not seen in the last 20 years. The news overshadowed a mix of corporate earnings reports. Weight Watchers plunged to its lowest point in nearly two years after issuing a dismal forecast. Best Buy surged on surprisingly good holiday sales. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 56 points, or 0.2 percent, to 26,001 as of 3:20 p.m. Eastern time. The S&P; 500 index fell less than 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.1 percent. Major indexes in Europe declined. TRADE DISPUTE: Negotiations between Washington and Beijing continue under the threat of additional tariffs on Chinese goods that could escalate the conflict and make products even more costly for consumers and companies. President Donald Trump has postponed increasing tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods that would have been effective March 2. He has not given a new date for the higher tariffs if negotiations falter. The main sticking point for the U.S. centers on ending cyber theft of commercial secrets, limits on state support for Chinese companies, and an end to the forced transfer of technology. ANALYST\u2019S TAKE: Lighthizer\u2019s comments are \u201ccreating market nervousness\u201d, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. Meanwhile, comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are shedding more light on the Fed\u2019s shift to a more cautious approach. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly reminding the market about the very significant about-face the Fed has made and that continues to raise questions about what the Fed has been seeing and what is it worried about,\u201d she said. SLIMMING DOWN: Weight Watchers shed 33.5 percent after the weight-loss program operator gave investors a surprisingly weak forecast. The company did not sign up as many subscribers as it hoped this winter and expects its profits to suffer. Weight Watchers says it now expects to earn between $1.25 and $1.50 a share this year. Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting $3.38 a share. CEO Mindy Grossman says the company hopes to pull in more subscribers this spring, with high-profile investor Oprah Winfrey playing a central role in its upcoming TV and digital marketing campaign. NOT SO HUNGRY: Dean Foods slid 13.6 percent after the food and beverage company reported a wider-than-expected loss in the fourth-quarter and suspended its dividend. HOLIDAY HIGHS: Best Buy surged 15.6 percent after reporting that its holiday sales bucked a downward trend for retailers. The electronics retailer\u2019s profit beat forecasts, but more importantly a key retail sales measure continued growing during a tough quarter for the industry.

Six quotes that came out on Monday, from a range of sources, could be grouped together and put into a time capsule to help future historians make sense of American politics circa 2019. -- The first is a little-noticed paragraph inside the 150-page budget request that President Trump submitted to Congress on Monday: \u201cEven with high levels of economic growth, excessive deficits continue to threaten the Nation\u2019s progress, and any unforeseen shocks to the economy could make deficits unsustainable,\u201d it says. \u201cIf financial obligations continue to grow at the current pace, the Nation\u2019s creditors may demand higher interest rates to compensate, potentially leading to lower private investment and a smaller capital stock, harming both American businesses and workers.\u201d The document warns that deficits are on track to remain over a trillion dollars per year \u201cfor the foreseeable future,\u201d the national debt \u2014 now $22 trillion \u2014 \u201cwill soon surpass a percent of GDP not seen since 1947,\u201d and interest payments alone on the federal government\u2019s debt will double by 2023 and exceed spending on the U.S. military by 2024 \u201cif nothing is done.\u201d The White House projects that the government will need to spend $482 billion on interest payments for the debt next year alone. That\u2019s more than the entire budget for Medicaid. What\u2019s remarkable is that there is no evidence of meaningful political will to tackle this potentially existential crisis. Leaders in both parties called the budget dead on arrival. Although the budget proposes \u201cthe \u2018most spending reductions ever sent to Congress,\u2019 as one of Trump\u2019s top aides put it, the deficit is expected to hit $1.1 trillion this year and stay above the trillion mark every year through at least 2022,\u201d economics correspondent Heather Long reports. \u201cThis is unprecedented in good economic times and is occurring because Trump and Congress are spending more at the same time the GOP tax cuts drive down government revenue. (Trump\u2019s budget shows small increases the next few years in tax revenue, but that might be a stretch given what is occurring so far this fiscal year).\u201d What should give Americans heartburn is that even the dire numbers are based on some fantastical \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 assumptions, including that there will not be a recession at any point in the next decade. \u201cNo president likes to predict a downturn, but Trump is being exceptionally rosy in his outlook,\u201d Heather notes. \u201cHis budget predicts about 3 percent growth every year for a decade. In contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts growth of slightly below 2 percent a year. To achieve Trump\u2019s projection, the economy would have to grow at A-plus potential for years with no recessions, something the United States has never achieved before.\u201d There are certainly some fiscal hawks who work inside the administration, like acting OMB director Russ Vought and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, but what matters is who sits in the Oval Office. Trump has called himself the king of debt and argued privately that deficits don\u2019t really matter because they won\u2019t blow up until after he leaves office. He didn\u2019t even mention the issue during his recent State of the Union address. There\u2019s a pattern of Republican politicians demanding fiscal responsibility when they\u2019re in the wilderness but then spending like drunken sailors on shore leave when they hold power. It\u2019s happening again. The 2017 GOP tax cuts, which overwhelmingly benefit the richest 1 percent of Americans and the biggest corporations, will add an estimated $1.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. With no change in trajectory, the ship of state will continue drifting down a river that ends with a waterfall. Former vice president Dick Cheney attends a memorial ceremony for George H.W. Bush at the Capitol in December. (Jonathan Ernst\/AP) 2. Dick Cheney: \u201cWe\u2019re getting into a situation when our friends and allies around the world that we depend upon are going to lack confidence in us. \u2026 I worry that the bottom line of that kind of an approach is we have an administration that looks a lot more like Barack Obama than Ronald Reagan.\u201d The former vice president uncorked one of the most searing conservative critiques to date of Trump\u2019s foreign policy while conducting a Q&A with Vice President Pence at a donor retreat this weekend sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute. Someone leaked a transcript yesterday of the off-the-record session on Sea Island, Ga. \u201cCheney respectfully but repeatedly and firmly pressed Pence on a number of the president\u2019s foreign policy moves,\u201d Ashley Parker and Bob Costa report. \u201cHe expressed concerns at such actions as taking a harder line toward U.S. allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and deciding to withdraw troops from Syria during what he fretted was \u2018the middle of a phone call.\u2019 \u2026 Cheney expressed alarm over news reports that Trump \u2018supposedly doesn\u2019t spend that much time with the intel people, or doesn\u2019t agree with them, frequently,\u2019 as well as the high staff turnover rate at the intelligence agencies. \u201cHe worried aloud, again and again, that for Trump, foreign policy boils down to a crude dollars-and-cents transaction. \u2026 He worried about Trump\u2019s decision to cancel the decades-long U.S. military exercises with South Korea and referenced a recent Bloomberg News report about the president\u2019s directive \u2018to pursue a policy that would insist that the Germans, the Japanese, and the South Koreans pay total cost for our deployments there, plus 50 percent on top of that.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018I don\u2019t know, that sounded like a New York state real estate deal to me,\u2019 Cheney quipped.\u201d Pence, unprepared for tough questions, mostly shrugged off Cheney\u2019s concerns and praised Trump as a transformational leader. Reading the transcript shows what a total loyalist Pence has become to Trump. He staked out several positions that are at odds with the posture he took as a congressman and governor. Moreover, the conversation between the two men who have held the No. 2 job underscored the deep fissures that remain inside the GOP over Trump\u2019s foreign policy. It\u2019s the same tension that led to Jim Mattis\u2019s resignation in December as defense secretary after Trump abruptly announced the complete withdrawal of troops from Syria. The president eventually relented under pressure from hawks on the Hill. Some troops will stay. 3. Nancy Pelosi: \u201cI\u2019m not for impeachment. \u2026 Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there\u2019s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don\u2019t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d \u201cThis is news,\u201d the House speaker told our Joe Heim last Wednesday for a story that published yesterday. \u201cI haven\u2019t said this to any press person before. But since you asked, and I\u2019ve been thinking about this.\u201d The California Democrat said this knowing that she\u2019d take instant and intense heat from her left flank, which she has, but her goal appears to be protecting vulnerable moderate members who are up for reelection next year in districts that Trump carried. Pelosi saw firsthand what happened to Republicans when they impeached Bill Clinton in the 1990s. She\u2019s realistic that the Republican-controlled Senate wouldn\u2019t convict Trump to remove him from office if Democrats acted unilaterally, and she gave herself an out to change her mind if something new emerges.\u00a0 Many Democratic strategists believe that impeachment would give Trump a useful foil and get recalcitrant Republicans to rally behind him for 2020, barring big new bombshells from the investigations by special counsel Bob Mueller or newly empowered congressional committees. Pelosi is one of the shrewdest tacticians in modern political history, and she appears to be playing a long game of trying to increase her party\u2019s odds of keeping its majority. \u201cWhile liberal firebrands have won an outsize share of media coverage, the House Democratic majority was captured largely because of freshmen who ran to the center, said Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \u2014 and many of them are uncomfortable with impeachment talk,\u201d Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 31 Democrats who serve in districts that Donald Trump won, and I\u2019m one of them,\u201d Bustos said. \u201cWhen I go home, I don\u2019t have people asking me about impeaching him. That is just not something that I hear. They consistently ask about health care and rebuilding our country and figuring out how to work together.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s comments will make it harder for Trump to say Democrats plan to impeach him and will tamp down on momentum to do so from the left. During her interview with Joe, the speaker was unequivocal that Trump is not fit to be president, ethically and intellectually. Then she demurred. \u201cI hardly ever talk about him,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not about him. It\u2019s about what we can do for the people to lower health-care costs, bigger paychecks [and] cleaner government.\u201d President Trump celebrates the passage of the GOP tax cuts in December 2017 with Paul Ryan. (Jabin Botsford\/The Washington Post) 4. Paul Ryan on 2020: \u201cThe person who defines that race is going to win the race. If this is about Donald Trump and his personality, he isn\u2019t going to win it.\u201d The former speaker of the House reportedly said during a speech last night in Vero Beach, Fla., that there are some Democrats who could beat Trump and the president must make the race about his policies, not his personal brand, if he\u2019s going to prevail. \u201cRyan said one of the House\u2019s biggest mistakes during his tenure was taking too long to negotiate a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Ali Schmitz reports for Treasure Coast Newspapers. \u201cRyan blamed the right-leaning flank of the party, including the Freedom Caucus, for causing a three-month delay in moving the legislation through the House. \u2018That three-month delay eroded public support for it, so by the time it got over to the Senate, it was hanging on a thread,\u2019 Ryan said. Ryan said if there weren\u2019t delays in moving it through the House, he would have expected it to pass the Senate.\u201d The 2012 GOP nominee for vice president said technology has created an outrage machine, according to the story: \u201cHe said people are \u2018monetizing\u2019 emotions, causing \u2018entertainment wings\u2019 of each party that focus on emotional responses rather than focusing on the merits\u201d of their policies. 5. Tucker Carlson: \u201c[W]e will never bow to the mob \u2014 ever. No matter what.\u201d Ryan didn\u2019t mention Carlson, but there\u2019s no doubt that the former House speaker was talking about people like him when he lamented the \u201centertainment wing\u201d of the GOP and the way it is \u201cmonetizing\u201d emotions. The Fox News host opened his 8 p.m. show last night with a defiant, six-minute monologue in which he refused to show any contrition at all over a batch of offensive comments he made a decade ago. Meanwhile, \u201cMedia Matters for America published a new video with clips of the Fox News host using racist and homophobic language to describe Iraqi people, African Americans, gay people and immigrants while speaking on a radio program between 2006 and 2011,\u201d Michael Brice-Saddler and Eli Rosenberg report. \u201cThe self-described watchdog of \u2018conservative misinformation in the U.S. media\u2019 published the audio from Carlson\u2019s appearances on a Tampa-based radio program, the \u2018Bubba the Love Sponge Show,\u2019 just 25 hours after releasing similar recordings in which he\u2019s heard flippantly using sexist language to express his views on child rape, rape shield laws, underage marriage and other sensitive topics. \u201cThe new audio highlights about a dozen instances of Carlson using racist language on the \u2018shock jock\u2019 show, which he apparently called into for about an hour per week. In 2008, Carlson lamented that \u2018everyone\u2019s embarrassed to be a white man,\u2019 before stating that white men deserve credit for \u2018creating civilization and stuff.\u2019 In another instance, Carlson is heard saying that Iraq is a \u2018crappy place filled with a bunch of, you know, semiliterate primitive monkeys,\u2019 adding, \u2018That\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t worth invading.\u2019 That follows a 2006 segment on the show in which Carlson said he had \u2018zero sympathy\u2019 for Iraqi people and their culture because they \u2018don\u2019t use toilet paper or forks.\u2019 \u201cCarlson also spoke crassly of immigrants and questioned Barack Obama\u2019s identity as a black man. \u2018How is he black, for one thing? He has one white parent, one black parent,\u2019 he said in 2006. Two years later, he added, \u2018I don\u2019t know how black he is, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a good basketball player \u2014 he says he is, anyway.\u2019\u201d Carlson went on the air about the same time the second video was released and said his critics weren\u2019t motivated by genuine concern. He said they\u2019re trying to silence him. Carlson praised the network for having his back even after the revelations. \u201cFirst, Fox News is behind us, as they have been since the very first day,\u201d he declared. \u201cToughness is a rare quality in a TV network, and we\u2019re grateful for that.\u201d We live in an era of conservative counterpunchers. Tellingly, Donald Trump Jr. praised Carlson for refusing to apologize: 6. Donald Trump: \u201cThe Democrats hate Jewish people.\u201d Attendees say the president made that comment on Friday during a Republican National Committee fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago Club. During her first news conference in more than 40 days, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders repeatedly declined to answer yesterday whether Trump truly believes Democrats \u201chate Jewish people.\u201d \u201cI think that\u2019s a question you ought to ask the Democrats,\u201d she said from\u00a0the podium. George W. Bush wrote in his memoir that Kanye West saying that \u201cBush doesn\u2019t care about black people\u201d after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was the \u201call-time low\u201d point of his presidency. The rapper\u2019s comment generated massive controversy. West later apologized to Bush, who forgave him. In this case, it\u2019s the president saying that the opposition party hates an entire faith of people and his press secretary not even trying to walk it back. The fact that it barely moves the needle shows how normalized over-the-top rhetoric, and questioning people\u2019s motives, has become in the Trump era. Sanders criticized the anti-hate resolution that passed the House last week for not singling out allegedly anti-Semitic comments made by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Trump allies say that he hopes to capitalize on the internal divisions among Democrats that the episode exposed, which pitted vocal newcomers on the far left, including Omar and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), against veteran lawmakers and Jewish members. The numbers don\u2019t bear out Trump\u2019s claims. \u201cThirty-two of the 34 Jewish members of Congress are Democrats. According to the Pew Research Center, more than 70 percent of Jewish Americans voted for [Hillary Clinton] in the 2016 presidential election,\u201d Eugene Scott notes. \u201cAn October 2018 poll found that 74 percent of Jews planned to vote for Democratic candidates in the midterm elections. Three quarters of respondents disapproved of the president\u2019s policies. \u2026 The president has developed close ties with Israel, and in particular [Bibi Netanyahu], but being pro-Israel and being the party of American Jews is not the same thing.\u201d Neither does the record: \u201cAfter white nationalists marched through Charlottesville, chanting \u2018Jews will not replace us,\u2019 Trump called some of the protesters \u2018very fine people,\u2019\u201d Eugene recalls. \u201cDuring the 2016 campaign, the president defended the use of an image of a six-point star, which resembled the Star of David, over a pile of $100 bills. The image was part of an attack against Clinton; many Jewish leaders said it was anti-Semitic. At a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition in 2015, Trump made comments that reinforced stereotypes about Jewish people. And in the final days of the campaign, he made headlines for running an ad that referenced the \u2018global power structure\u2019 attempting to control the world through Clinton while featuring images of prominent Jewish leaders.\u201d WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Britain just banned the Boeing 737 Max from its airspace after China, Australia and other nations grounded the jets in the wake of the crash in Ethiopia. Gerry Shih reports: \u201cWhen China became the first country on Monday to order all Boeing 737 Max 8 planes grounded in the wake of the Ethiopian Airlines crash, its aviation regulator sent an unmistakable signal: the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is no longer the only authority in civil aviation worldwide. \u2026 China\u2019s move, which was unprecedented for a government that once took cues from the FAA, was motivated by what Chinese officials and pilots said was months of equivocation from U.S. officials and Boeing in response to safety inquiries from China after the crash of a 737 Max 8 in Indonesia last October. \u2026 \u201cAfter China ordered a dozen carriers to ground their 96 planes \u2014 roughly a quarter of all 737 Max in operation globally \u2014 authorities in Ethiopia, Singapore, Indonesia, Morocco and Mongolia quickly followed suit, as did carriers in Latin America and South Korea. Despite the FAA issuing a statement backing the Boeing jet\u2019s airworthiness, Britain, Australia, Malaysia and Oman became the latest countries to ground the model a day later, with authorities saying the aircraft would not be allowed to fly to or from their countries pending the investigation.\u201d The U.S. embassy in Caracas. (Luis Robayo\/AFP\/Getty Images) -- The United States is pulling out its remaining diplomatic personnel from its embassy in Caracas, Venezuela, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced overnight. Paul Schemm reports: \u201cThe United States and the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro are increasingly at odds, with the Trump administration openly supporting his rival, Juan Guaid\u00f3, as the country\u2019s legitimate leader. The country has been crippled by a five-day power outage that has plunged people into darkness and left food and water scarce. \u2026 The government announced that schools and commercial activities would again be suspended on Tuesday due to the power outage. \u2026 Appearing on television Monday, Maduro stated that progress was being made in restoring power. He blamed the crisis on sabotage.\u201d -- A Venezuelan journalist whom Maduro allies have accused of orchestrating the blackout is missing, and press freedom\u00a0groups believe the government is holding him.\u00a0The reporter, Luis Carlos Diaz, has been a frequent critic of Maduro's government and frequently been the target of online attacks by accounts close to Maduro's government after he revealed\u00a0the state-run telephone and Internet provider in Venezuela was phishing its users.

(Cathy Free) MORE ON THE TRUMP\u00a0BUDGET: -- Nancy Pelosi promised that the House will reject Trump\u2019s budget, and even many congressional Republicans criticized various elements of the proposal. Damian Paletta, Erica Werner and Jeff Stein report: \u201cAnd the demand for $8.6 billion for a border wall, less than two months after a 35-day shutdown paralyzed much of Washington, raised the possibility that there could be an even more dramatic impasse if a spending deal isn\u2019t reached by the end of September. \u2026 Top White House officials acknowledged that lawmakers routinely dismiss these budget proposals, but they signaled a willingness on Monday to fight harder this year than they have in the past. \u2026 Trump\u2019s GOP allies, meanwhile, received the budget plan with a lukewarm embrace. \u2026 The defense spending increase in the budget includes funneling more than $170 billion into a special overseas account, something even some Republicans dismissed as a gimmick aimed at getting around existing spending caps.\u201d -- Trump\u2019s proposal to cut Medicare spending by $845 billion over the next 10 years, despite his campaign promises to protect the popular program, will encounter some of the strongest resistance.\u00a0From Jeff Stein and Amy Goldstein: \u201cMost of the trims relate to changing payments to doctors and hospitals\u00a0\u2026 During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump said he would not cut Medicare or Social Security, the retirement program for the elderly, but his budget last year also included a proposed cut of more than $550 billion to the program.\u201d -- \u201cMedicare-for-all v. Medicare-for-less: Trump\u2019s proposed cuts put health care at center of 2020 race,\u201d\u00a0Toluse Olorunnipa and Sean Sullivan report: \u201cTrump\u2019s proposed Medicare savings are more than three times as large as those in his previous budget, and industry lobbying groups said the reductions would hurt hospitals and seniors. ... Democratic strategists and officials argued Monday that Trump\u2019s budget proposal exposed how little credibility Republicans have in debating health care, and showed signs of confidence that it would sharpen the contrast Democrats are seeking to make in the run-up to the 2020 election.\u201d -- Cronyism alert: One of the budget's clearest beneficiaries is Trump's golfing buddy\u00a0Jack Nicklaus, the namesake of a children's hospital in Miami. Under the proposal, the Health and Human Services Department would steer $20 million toward a mobile children's hospital project at the Nicklaus Children's Hospital. Politico's Dan Diamond reports: Nicklaus \u201chad lobbied Trump on the golf course in Florida, and he met with HHS Secretary Alex Azar and then-OMB Director Mick Mulvaney in Washington, D.C., to request funds, say two individuals with knowledge. Trump personally directed HHS to earmark the funds to help Nicklaus develop mobile children's hospitals, one individual said.\u201d\u00a0 -- Trump\u2019s budget proposal would hit America\u2019s poor the hardest,\u00a0\u201cslashing billions of dollars in food stamps, health insurance and federal housing subsidies while pushing legislation to institute broad work requirements for families receiving housing vouchers, expanding on moves by some states to require recipients of Medicaid and food stamps to work,\u201d\u00a0Caitlin Dewey, Tracy Jan and Jeff Stein report. -- The budget would slash $8.5 billion from the Department of Education. Moriah Balingit and Danielle Douglas-Gabriel report: \u201cTrump\u2019s budget request again seeks to cut popular programs, including one that supports after-school activities for children in impoverished communities and another that offers wide-ranging grants that underwrite textbooks, equipment, counseling services and other needs for schools. That pool of money \u2014 the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grant program \u2014 also underwrites school safety efforts, including mental-health services and school safety equipment.\u201d -- The budget would also make federal workers pay more toward their retirement benefits until the employee and government share is equal. Eric Yoder reports: \u201cFor most employees that would mean an increase of about six percentage points, which would be phased in as one percentage point more per year. The government share would decrease on the same schedule. Also under the proposal, for employees retiring after an unspecified date, annuity benefits would be based on the highest five consecutive salary years rather than the currently used 'high-3.'\u00a0Further, it would end a supplemental benefit paid to many employees who retire before age 62, when they become eligible for Social Security.\u201d\u00a0 -- House Dems are likely to skip a vote on a budget this year to avoid what could be an embarrassing intraparty battle. Though publicly many Democrats have said they want a chance to vote on their party\u2019s fiscal blueprint, privately they\u2019re saying that a budget is unlikely to come to a vote given the multiple divisions within the caucus. (Politico) House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) wants to interview two lawyers in connection to Trump's ethical and financial disclosures. (Alex Brandon\/AP) THERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four Trump Organization projects, as well as Trump's failed effort to buy the Buffalo Bills. Michael Cohen testified during last month's hearing that Trump inflated his assets in financial statements, and Cohen provided copies of statements he said had been submitted to Deutsche Bank. \u201cThe inquiry by Ms. James\u2019s office is a civil investigation, not a criminal one, although its focus and scope were unclear,\u201d\u00a0the Times\u2019s William K. Rashbaum and Danny Hakim report. -- House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.)\u00a0is seeking\u00a0testimony from\u00a0two lawyers responsible for Trump\u2019s ethical and financial disclosures. But the White House is blocking him from talking to a potentially key witness. CNN's Jeremy Herb and Pamela Brown report: \u201cWhite House Counsel Pat Cipollone accused the committee of making 'grossly unfair' allegations against Stefan Passantino and Trump's personal attorney Sheri Dillon \u2014 both of whom Cummings wants to interview \u2014 and damaging their reputations. Last month, Cummings sent a letter to Cipollone that stated the committee has obtained new documents showing Passantino and Dillon 'may have provided false information' when they were questioned by federal ethics officials about hush money payments paid to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. ...\u00a0In response, Cipollone chided Cummings for directly requesting an interview with Passantino, instead of going through the White House counsel's office, and said the White House would not make Passantino available.\u201d -- Contradicting Cohen's sworn testimony, Stormy Daniels\u2019s former lawyer Keith Davidson said Trump\u2019s longtime fixer was outraged when no White House position materialized for him. ABC News\u2019s Tom Llamas and Kaitlyn Folmer report: \u201cThe man who once famously said he would \u2018take a bullet\u2019 for Trump was left embarrassed and embittered, Davidson said, when despite his years of loyalty, he was not tapped for a position, like White House chief of staff or attorney general, in Trump's administration. \u2018He confided in me that he was just beside himself, and, in his words, you know, he said, 'Can you \u2026 believe, after everything I've done, he's not taking me to Washington?'\u2018 Davidson recalled. \u2018He felt that it was a personal embarrassment for him, that he was rejected.\u2019\u201d -- Former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker will return to Capitol Hill tomorrow for a private meeting with the House Judiciary Committee. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cIn a letter to Whitaker after his testimony, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said members of the panel found Whitaker\u2019s answers \u2018unsatisfactory, incomplete, or contradicted by other evidence,\u2019 stressing that they wanted to meet with him again so he could \u2018elaborate\u2019 on his testimony. \u2026 Nadler questioned Whitaker\u2019s testimony indicating that he never discussed Trump\u2019s frustration with Michael Cohen.\u201d -- The Senate Intelligence Committee spoke privately to Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos, who is married to former Trump campaign foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cThe panel asked Mangiante Papadopoulos about her former employer Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor with suspected ties to the Kremlin ... Mifsud, prosecutors have said, offered to help her husband ... broker meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials \u2026 Mangiante Papadopoulos said congressional investigators were more focused on her experience working with Mifsud than what she knew of her husband\u2019s activities during the campaign.\u201d -- Attorneys for Roger Stone apologized in a new filing last night for misrepresenting to a federal judge plans about his new book criticizing Bob Mueller. But they said it was an unintentional mistake\u00a0and the court can still seat an impartial jury.\u00a0Spencer S. Hsu reports: \u201cAttorneys for the Republican operative and longtime friend of President Trump acknowledge that the gaffe could land Stone in jail if the judge finds he violated a gag order in his case barring him from feeding prejudicial pretrial publicity. But they denied using an erroneous March 1 filing notifying the court of the 'imminent release' of the book \u2014 after the judge imposed the gag order Feb. 21 \u2014 to build publicity for the work, 'The Myth of Russian Collusion,' a retitled version of his earlier book about Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, with a new introduction. 'There was\/is no intention to hide anything,'\u00a0wrote Stone\u2019s attorneys.\u201d -- The same federal judge overseeing Stone\u2019s criminal case, Amy Berman Jackson, will decide tomorrow whether to add prison time to Manafort\u2019s sentence. Spencer reports: \u201cThe looming question Wednesday is whether any prison time Jackson might impose will overlap or be tacked on to the 47-month term Manafort received last week from U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III in Alexandria. \u2026 In overseeing the Manafort case and the separate case of [Stone], Jackson has given a master class in how to try high-profile cases, some colleagues on the bench said, by relying on preparation, discretion and a refusal to get drawn into side disputes.\u201d -- For what it's worth, the special counsel's effort is fully funded through the end of September. After that, Mueller can request funding for the next fiscal year by the end of June.\u00a0(Reuters) Officials examine contains\u00a03,200 pounds of cocaine seized at the Port of New York\u00a0in Newark\u00a0by Customs and Border Protection. (U.S. Customs and Border Protection\/AP) THE IMMIGRATION WARS:\u00a0 -- A major cocaine bust highlights\u00a0an inconvenient truth for Trump and his immigration policies: The vast majority of drugs come through legal ports of entry.\u00a0Eli Rosenberg writes:\u00a0\u201cDespite Trump\u2019s claims, experts say the majority of drugs come into the United States through legal ports of entry \u2014 not illegal crossings. Customs and Border Protection announced that a task force drawn from six law enforcement organizations had seized 3,200 pounds of cocaine \u2014 a street value of $77 million \u2014 on Feb. 28, not from some dusty overland trail in Texas, but from a shipping container that arrived at the port in Newark. It was the largest cocaine seizure at the port in nearly 25 years.\u201d -- More than 2,000 people in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody have been quarantined amid an outbreak of mumps and other contagious diseases. From CNN\u2019s Geneva Sands, Michelle Lou and Susan Scutti: \u201c\u2018As of March 7, 2019, there was a total of 2,287 detainees cohorted for exposure to a detainee with a contagious condition,\u2019 said ICE spokesperson Brendan Raedy in a statement. In the past 12 months, there have been health investigations at 51 ICE detention facilities for mumps, chickenpox and influenza, according to Raedy. There have been 236 reported cases of mumps, with another 16 suspected cases during this time period. \u2026 It was unclear Monday, if ICE was taking additional steps to deal with issues of disease in its facilities.\u201d -- Top officials at a troubled Texas charity for migrants resigned following months of investigations into allegations of mismanagement and malfeasance.\u00a0The Times's Nicholas Kulish, Kim Barker and Rebecca R. Ruiz report: \u201cFor months, Juan Sanchez was at the center of the national uproar over family separations at the Mexican border because the nonprofit he founded, Southwest Key Programs, was housing migrant children taken from their parents. On Monday, facing intense scrutiny from his own organization and federal investigations over alleged financial improprieties, he stepped down after 32 years at the helm. ...\u00a0The Southwest Key shelter in a former Walmart superstore in Brownsville, Tex., known as Casa Padre, became a symbol of the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy, with immigration advocates likening it to a warehouse for children. But it was also a generator of millions of dollars in federal grants at a nonprofit unusually concerned with its bottom line. ...\u00a0Mr. Sanchez earned $1.5 million in 2017, the most recent tax return available. His wife earned $500,000. His daughter from a previous marriage also held a senior position, but her salary was not available. Ms. Chung earned $1 million.\u201d\u00a0 -- The Customs and Border Protection agency plans to implement a \u201cbiometric entry-exit system\u201d\u00a0using\u00a0facial recognition technology on more than 100 million travelers flying out of the United States. BuzzFeed News's Davey Alba reports\u00a0on\u00a0documents obtained by the nonprofit research organization Electronic Privacy Information Center: \u201cThese same documents state \u2014 explicitly \u2014 that there were no limits on how partnering airlines can use this facial recognition data. CBP did not answer specific questions about whether there are any guidelines for how other technology companies involved in processing the data can potentially also use it. ... CBP did not explain what its current policies around data sharing of biometric information with participating companies and third-party firms are, but it did say that the agency 'retains photos \u2026 for up to 14 days' of non-US citizens departing the country, for 'evaluation of the technology' and 'assurance of the accuracy of the algorithms'\u00a0\u2014 which implies such photos might be used for further training of its facial matching AI.\u201d\u00a0 Facial recognition technology is already at use in 17 international airports, including\u00a0New York, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago and Houston. Major airlines including Delta, American Airlines and British Airways support the usage of this technology. -- The apparel manufacturing, taxi and limousine services, as well as\u00a0nail salons and personal care industries depend the most on immigrant labor, according to a new report by the New American Economy group. In New York, 80 percent of limo and taxi drivers are immigrants while in California, more than 75 percent of agriculture workers are immigrants. (Axios)\u00a0 THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- British\u00a0lawmakers will determine this week whether to delay Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. William Booth and Karla Adam report: \u201cOn Tuesday, British lawmakers are scheduled to vote again on [Prime Minister Theresa]\u00a0May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, along with the supplemental statements. A possible series of votes this week will help determine whether Britain will depart on schedule on March 29 \u2014 or whether there will be more uncertainty, division and delay.\u201d -- Pelosi and Mitch McConnell extended a rare bipartisan invitation to NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg to address a joint session of Congress next month. Seung Min Kim, Rachael Bade and Robert Costa report: \u201cNATO declined to say whether Stoltenberg would accept the invitation, saying that his schedule during his Washington trip in April \u2018will be announced in due course.\u2019 The invitation could put the NATO leader in a slightly awkward position. Stoltenberg has gone to great lengths to foster a positive relationship with Trump. If the congressional invitation were seen as too direct a rebuke to the White House, it could suck him into a domestic U.S. political battle he has been eager to avoid.\u201d -- The Trump administration threatened to scale back its intelligence sharing with Germany if Berlin allows\u00a0the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei to participate in the country\u2019s development of a 5G network. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Bojan Pancevski and Sara Germano report: The threat \u201cmarks the first time the U.S. has explicitly warned an ally that refusing to ostracize Huawei could lessen security cooperation with Washington. \u2026 Both German and U.S. officials said the threat from Washington will unsettle Germany\u2019s security community, which is a big consumer of intelligence provided by the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and other U.S. information gatherers.\u201d -- The Trump administration has taken a harder-line approach to denuclearizing North Korea since the president's failed second summit with Kim Jong Un last month.\u00a0John Hudson reports: \u201cIn remarks Monday, a top U.S. envoy said the United States would not lift sanctions on North Korea until it completely dismantles its nuclear and ballistic missiles. The United States is also seeking an end to Pyongyang\u2019s chemical and biological weapons, he said. \u2026 Confronted with North Korea\u2019s insistence on major sanctions relief at the summit, the United States made a counterproposal demanding full sanctions relief for full denuclearization, said the diplomats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.\u201d -- Syrian government forces have frequently subjected male prisoners to sexual violence. Louisa Loveluck reports: \u201cAccording to a report released Monday by Lawyers and Doctors for Human Rights, a Syrian rights group, security forces have used rape and enforced sterilization, as well as the tying, burning and mutilation of men\u2019s genitals, to force confessions and submission.\u201d Kirsten Gillibrand worships at Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church in South Carolina last month. (Meg Kinnard\/AP) 2020 WATCH: -- Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) continues\u00a0to defend her office's investigation into sexual harassment claims made by a former aide.

(Felicia Sonmez) -- Beto O\u2019Rourke is expected to launch his presidential campaign very soon, even though he has not really prepared in the traditional way. The New York Times\u2019s Matt Flegenheimer and Lisa Lerer report: \u201cThere has been no flirtation tour in Iowa, no trip to New Hampshire since his college years as an Ivy League rower. Mr. O\u2019Rourke had no traditional campaign-in-waiting at the ready after the midterms \u2026 Few doubt Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s capacity to upend the race regardless, buoyed by a talent for relentless retail politics, a formidable low-dollar fundraising army and an unsubtle contrast to front-runners in their 70s, like [Biden and Sanders]. \u2026 But perhaps no major 2020 player invites as many question marks as Mr. O\u2019Rourke, and his drawn-out non-candidacy has provided few answers.\u201d\u00a0O\u2019Rourke announced in a Twitter video that he would make his first visit to Iowa this weekend. -- Stacey Abrams, who also lost the Georgia gubernatorial\u00a0race last year, said\u00a0she could run for president in 2020\u00a0after saying previously that 2028 would be the earliest race she'd consider.\u00a0(CNN) -- Under fire, Facebook quickly reversed its decision to pull ads by Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign calling for the breakup of the social media giant. Politico\u2019s Cristiano Lima reports: \u201cThe ads, which had identical images and text, touted Warren's recently announced plan to unwind \u2018anti-competitive\u2019 tech mergers, including Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram. \u2026 A message on the three ads said: \u2018This ad was taken down because it goes against Facebook's advertising policies.\u2019 A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the ads had been taken down but said the company is in the process of restoring them.\u201d -- Related: Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission accusing the agency of allowing Facebook and other tech giants to mishandle consumers\u2019 private data. Tony Romm reports: \u201cHawley said there is \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 that Facebook had broken a 2011 agreement with the FTC that settled an earlier probe into its privacy practices \u2014 a breach that could trigger steep federal fines.\u201d -- \u201cCourt packing\u201d is gaining currency among far-left activists, who in turn are trying to prod presidential candidates to embrace it.\u00a0Michael Scherer reports: \u201cFormer attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., who recently decided against running for president, became the latest figure to embrace an expansion of the nine-member court in recent talks at Yale Law School and Columbia University. \u2026 [South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg] has also discussed a 15-justice structure for the court \u2014 five Democratic appointees, five Republican appointees and five chosen by the other 10. \u2026 The concept of expanding the Supreme Court, like the phrase \u2018court packing\u2019 itself, fell into lengthy disrepute after 1937, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt ... sought to add six friendlier justices, prompting an outcry even from allies.\u00a0 -- The strong showings of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders in the latest Iowa poll are impressive but shouldn\u2019t be overemphasized, Dan Balz writes: \u201cThe poll should be read in two ways \u2014 as a sign of initial strength for each of them, and as an indication of the vulnerabilities the two best-known figures in the race could face. \u2026 With a big field assembling, those numbers \u2014 Biden at 27 percent and Sanders at 25 percent \u2014 are helpful but not overwhelmingly impressive. At every candidate event this year, there are more shoppers than buyers, and any number of candidates are drawing crowds and good reviews. Other candidates are and will have their moments. Still, it is notable that Biden and Sanders are where they are, given who they are.\u201d -- This week, Biden will address the International Association of Firefighters and the Delaware Democratic Party, two supportive audiences that will serve as the final test drive before the former vice president makes a 2020 decision. From NBC News\u2019s Mike Memoli: \u201cThe coming week may be a point of no return for him, as aides recognize that the party\u2019s patience is wearing thin. To the extent advisers identify any potential hurdles he\u2019s still reckoning with, they are parallel: how and when to engage with attacks from the most strident partisan voices in both parties, including Trump.\u201d No final decisions have been made on what Biden\u2019s campaign platform would be, but advisers said their starting point is similar to the one he sketched out when he considered joining the 2016 race which includes: \u00a0 -- Many of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s closest aides are trying to talk him out of running for president.\u00a0Politico\u2019s Laura Nahmias and Sally Goldenberg report: \u201cAs de Blasio touted his liberal record in Iowa and South Carolina in recent weeks, nearly three dozen former and current aides, consultants and allies ... panned the idea or doubted that the mayor would run for the Democratic nomination. Aside from the few people working on the nascent effort, only two said de Blasio should run.\u201d -- The large Democratic\u00a0field is stressing out a very specific group of people:\u00a0pollsters. Politico's Steven Shepard reports:\u00a0\u201cNew surveys are cramming up to 23 Democrats into their questionnaires after the Democratic National Committee set a low, 1 percent polling threshold to gain admittance into the party\u2019s first primary debates. The miles-long list of candidates has created an unusual set of methodological challenges for pollsters already battling declining engagement with their surveys. ...\u00a0The 2020 race presents a different problem: which candidates to include. Most pollsters are choosing to list as many candidates as possible \u2014 even at the risk of flooding poll respondents with a long list of names.\u201d\u00a0 -- Maryland Gov.

The message of the film is conveyed less through the story than through its casting: women and people of color need to have starring roles in major Hollywood productions, which, at the moment, mainly mean big-budget superhero movies, the most profitable films in the industry. Its implicit subject is more than representation \u2014 it\u2019s also the redistribution of power in Hollywood. There are some secondary (but still significant) messages, too, but the movie itself is, for the most part, trivial.

The FEC ordered the super PAC and the company to pay a combined $940,000 in penalties \u2014 one of its largest fines to date, according to FEC records.

Trump spent all week trying to convince Republicans not to cross him on border security -- lunching with lawmakers, calling them directly, and firing off tweets and statements that were alternatively threatening and cajoling. Yet despite his best efforts, the Republican-controlled Senate is poised to rebuke Trump's emergency declaration along the U.S.-Mexico border. 'Putting\u00a0the squeeze on': Trump's allies on the Hill say Trump's personal outreach frenzy\u00a0is the latest evidence that Trump is running the White House as he would run the Trump Organization.\u00a0 No dice: Ultimately, though, these efforts are falling flat. Uniquely Trumpian: Trump's hands-on approach has been described by lawmakers and sources\u00a0on Capitol Hill as uniquely Trumpian.\u00a0 My colleagues Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and John Wagner report that Trump himself called Lee yesterday to \"express his opposition\" to\u00a0his plan to restrain presidential emergency powers in the future. Lee\u2019s measure, which would have expired national emergencies after 30 days unless Congress voted to keep them, was seen as a compromise that could limit Republican votes on the separate measure to nullify Trump\u2019s current emergency.\u00a0 Shortly after the call, Lee announced he would vote for the disapproval resolution on Thursday.\u00a0 \"Lee\u2019s announcement ensures there will be majority support for the disapproval resolution, which already passed the House,\u201d my colleagues write. \u201cSenate passage will send the measure to Trump, forcing him to issue the first veto of his administration to strike it down. Although Congress lacks the votes needed to override Trump\u2019s veto, the Senate vote would still stand as an embarrassing rejection of a key Trump initiative at the hands of his own party.\u201d\u00a0 Not the only defeat for Trump: The Senate also voted yesterday to rebuke of the Trump administration's support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.\u00a0 Exasperation on the Hill:\u00a0\u00a0The president throwing cold water on Lee's compromise plan on the border highlighted to some how, in Trump's administration, it's\u00a0up to Trump to call the shots.\u00a0 My colleagues Seung Min and Erica had reported on Tuesday that in a meeting with Republicans that day that\u00a0\u201cPence floated the prospect of revising the 30-day period to 30 legislative days, which could considerably drag out that timeline, according to one official familiar with the discussions.\u201d Pushback: But a White House official made clear to Power Up that there was no deal\u00a0for Pence to quarterback.\u00a0 'Simply a gross inaccuracy': The letter below is a copy of the first page of a three-page letter that the White House distributed to GOP senators drafted by legal scholars who argued why Trump's national declaration is not an unconstitutional power grab.\u00a0 \"SUCKED\": The FAA finally decided to follow our counterparts around the world yesterday in grounding the Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 after reviewing\u00a0airplane data showing similarities between the deadly crash in Ethiopia last Sunday and the one that\u00a0occurred in Indonesia several months ago, The Post reports.\u00a0 Trump made the abrupt announcement after Boeing and the FAA insisted earlier in the day on Wednesday that the planes were still safe to fly.\u00a0 'Unusual step': Trump made the announcement as \"there were growing questions about the slow response to the crisis and whether the nation\u2019s top air-safety officials acted quickly enough to protect the flying public,\" my colleagues\u00a0Luz Lazo, Michael Laris, Lori Aratani\u00a0and Damian Paletta\u00a0report.\u00a0 The decision process: \"Trump was inclined to announce a grounding on Tuesday, but he received pushback from the FAA, which had not yet reached a decision, according to officials familiar with the deliberations. But Trump also equivocated himself, telling advisers that grounding planes would cause panic and could hurt the stock market, according to two people who spoke to him,\" Toluse and Josh report.

Two judges, two different tones: Jackson's remarks to Manafort\u00a0differed sharply from the sentencing judge in Virginia, T.S. Ellis, who said Manafort\u00a0had lived \"an otherwise blameless life.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Trump weighs in: \"I feel very badly for Paul Manafort,\" Trump told reporters later on Wednesday. He added that\u00a0he had \"not thought about\" pardoning him.\u00a0 PREVENTING A PARDON: Manafort's New York charges are \"an effort to ensure he will still face prison time if Mr. Trump pardons him for his federal crimes,\" the New York Times's\u00a0William Rashbaum reports.\u00a0 MEANWHILE, ON THE HILL:\u00a0House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) told reporters after a closed door meeting with the former acting attorney general yesterday\u00a0that Matthew Whitaker had been \u201cdirectly involved\u201d in \u201cconversations about whether to fire U.S. attorneys, though the congressman didn\u2019t specify which ones,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Rebecca Ballhaus and Dustin Volz report. MUELLER REPORT WATCH: And for those of us searching for any sign of when the Mueller report will be released: NPR\u2019s Carrie Johnson reports that one of his top\u00a0prosecutors, Andrew Weissmann, \u201cwill soon leave the office and the Justice Department, two sources close to the matter tell NPR\u2026. The departure is the strongest sign yet that Mueller and his team have all but concluded their work.\u201d What we're reading:\u00a0","133":"THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0During that freewheeling news conference at which he declared a national emergency the Friday before last, President Trump made the case for why he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize. In doing so, he came closer than ever to publicly acknowledging that he is a disciple of what Richard Nixon dubbed the \u201cmadman theory\u201d of foreign policy. The president gleefully recounted his own bellicosity to suggest that his rhetoric scared North Korean leader Kim Jong Un into coming to the table in pursuit of peace. \u201c\u2018Fire and fury,\u2019 \u2018Total annihilation,\u2019 \u2018My button is bigger than yours,\u2019 and \u2018My button works.\u2019 Remember that? \u2026 And people said, \u2018Trump is crazy,\u2019\u201d Trump said in the Rose Garden. \u201cAnd you know what it ended up being? A very good relationship. I like him a lot, and he likes me a lot.\u201d The president\u2019s comments are instructive ahead of his second summit with Kim on Wednesday in Hanoi, where he just touched down on Air Force One. The North Korean leader arrived overnight via train. \u201cNobody else would have done that,\u201d Trump said of his willingness to escalate tensions with Pyongyang in a bid to ultimately defuse them. \u201cThe Obama administration couldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d -- When Trump seems crazy to his critics, sometimes he is being crazy like a fox. Friends and former aides say he is more aware than most people think of how he\u2019s perceived at home and abroad. He has repeatedly sought to use his reputation for rashness and unpredictability to his advantage, sometimes successfully. Trump is not wrong that his threats have packed more of a punch because foreign leaders think he might go through with them. For example, no one would have believed Barack Obama or George W. Bush if either of them threatened to scuttle NATO or NAFTA to prod allies to spend more on defense or improve the terms of existing trade deals. People also wouldn\u2019t have believed past presidents if they had tweeted they were going to impose stiff tariffs on all Chinese imports. Yet many serious people really thought a year ago that there was some possibility Trump might actually go through with a preemptive strike on Pyongyang after all his charged rhetoric, despite American military commanders warning that such a move could lead to tens of thousands being killed. In other words, Trump\u2019s intimidations have seemed more credible because he\u2019s gladly encouraged the global perception that he\u2019s quarrelsome. The president has preached the virtue of strategic unpredictability as a lever to gain the upper hand in negotiations. \u201cWe must as a nation be more unpredictable,\u201d Trump said as a candidate in 2016. \u201cWe have to be unpredictable!\u201d President Trump confers with Henry Kissinger in the Oval Office in October 2017. (Melina Mara\/The Washington Post) -- A generation ago, when the eyes of the world were on Hanoi for a very different reason, Nixon wanted to convince the Soviets and their North Vietnamese clients that he was an unstable hothead who was willing to use nuclear weapons. The goal was to bring an end to the quagmire at the negotiating table. \u201cI call it the madman theory,\u201d Nixon explained to H.R. Haldeman, who would serve as his White House chief of staff, while they walked along a foggy beach one day in 1968, according to Haldeman\u2019s memoir. \u201cI want the North Vietnamese to believe I\u2019ve reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We\u2019ll just slip the word to them that, \u2018For God\u2019s sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about communism. We can\u2019t restrain him when he\u2019s angry \u2014 and he has his hand on the nuclear button!\u2019 And Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.\u201d -- Nixon certainly didn\u2019t invent the concept; he just coined the term. Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli wrote back in 1517 that \u201cat times it is a very wise thing to simulate madness.\u201d -- Trump has long admired Nixon, and he signaled even before taking office that he\u2019d embrace the madman theory. Henry Kissinger, the nonagenarian who was tasked back in the day with \u201cslipping the word\u201d that Nixon might just be wacky enough to use The Bomb, has tutored Trump on foreign policy and repeatedly given him advice before big meetings with heads of state, including Kim and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. During an April 1971 conversation, which was recorded and has now been transcribed, Nixon told Kissinger that he should try to break an impasse in peace talks by hinting to Hanoi that the use of nuclear weapons was back on the table. \u201cYou can say, \u2018I cannot control him.\u2019 Put it that way,\u201d Nixon told his secretary of state. \u201cYeah,\u201d Kissinger replied. \u201cAnd imply that you might use nuclear weapons.\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Nixon, adding that Kissinger should say: \u201cI just want you to know he is not going to cave.\u201d -- Game theory experts teach that acting irrationally can sometimes be very rational. Trump plainly believes he\u2019s a good bluffer, even when his bluffs get called again and again. The fact that he doesn\u2019t always fold right away, even when he has a losing hand, has strengthened his capacity to keep others on their toes. Consider the partial government shutdown, which became the longest in American history. Even though he ultimately caved, and declared a national emergency to try getting the money Congress would not appropriate for a wall, Trump showed he was willing to drag out the fight. He kept it going even as his polling numbers took a hit. The same is true on the world stage. He\u2019s kept the door open to military intervention in Venezuela, even as he orders a drawdown of troops in Syria and Afghanistan. He\u2019s also saber-rattled against Iran since pulling out of the nuclear deal. And he said during his State of the Union this month that he would be willing to spend whatever is necessary to win an arms race with the Russians. All these moves are risky and might backfire over the long term, but Trump appears to believe he is setting the terms of the debate. -- Ever the showman, Trump recognizes the power of fear. Indeed, Bob Woodward\u2019s entire book last year (\u201cFear\u201d) was based on this premise. -- Trump has even advised his own aides to tell people on the outside that he is \u201ccrazy\u201d if they think it will help in negotiations. During an Oval Office meeting in September 2017, Trump told chief trade negotiator Bob Lighthizer that he should threaten to have the U.S. withdraw from its free trade agreement with South Korea. Axios reported this exchange at the time: \u201cYou've got 30 days, and if you don't get concessions, then I'm pulling out,\u201d Trump told Lighthizer. \u201cOkay,\u00a0well I'll tell the Koreans they've got 30 days,\" Lighthizer replied. \u201cNo, no, no,\" Trump interjected. \"That's not how you negotiate. You don't tell them they've got 30 days. You tell them, 'This guy's so crazy he could pull out any minute!\u2019\u201d \u201cThat's what you tell them: Any minute,\u201d Trump continued. During an Oval Office meeting this past Friday focused on defusing the trade war that he started, Trump once again admonished Lighthizer \u2013 this time in front of a Chinese delegation. The veteran lawyer was rebuked by Trump for saying the two sides were working on a \u201cmemorandum of understanding.\u201d Trump said the term, routinely used in situations like this, does not \u201cmean very much.\u201d The president also did this in front of reporters. For close Trump observers, it felt like he was saying this as much to unnerve his foreign visitors and keep them on their toes as because he was going to kill the deal. But with Trump you never know. And that\u2019s just the way he wants it. -- The irony, of course, is that the madman theory did not ultimately work for Nixon. Vietnam remains one of the most humiliating chapters in America\u2019s history. New York University historian Tim Naftali, the former director of the Nixon presidential library, says North Vietnam more likely came to the table for other reasons. He also argues that Nixon played the part of a madman to give himself domestic cover with his base to open relations with China and pursue detente with the Kremlin. \u201cNixon\u2019s madman strategy wasn\u2019t supposed to take three and a half years, over 21,000 U.S. deaths, and untold Vietnamese losses, to work. It was supposed to be a version of 'shock and awe,\u2019\u201d Naftali wrote for the Atlantic in 2017. \u201cThere can be little debate, however, over what Nixon\u2019s calculated unpredictability abroad achieved at home. It tore this country apart. In a declassified \u2018eyes only\u2019 memorandum to Alexander Haig on May 20, 1972, after ordering the mining of Haiphong harbor, Nixon explained who his domestic audience was: \u2018The hawks are our hard core and we must do everything that we can to keep them from jumping ship [in reaction to arms-control talks with Moscow] after getting their enthusiasm restored as a result of our mining operation in the North.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- British Prime Minister Theresa May for the first time admitted that Brexit may be delayed, as a bitterly divided Parliament struggles over how \u2014 or even if \u2014 Britain should leave the European Union. William Booth and Karla Adam report from London: \u201cMay told lawmakers that if Parliament next month rejects her Brexit deal again, the lawmakers will be given a vote on whether to ask the European Union to allow Britain to remain a part of the trading bloc for several more months. May said that if such an extension were triggered, it would likely be granted only once and that the time would be \u2018short and limited.\u2019 She suggested an extension until June would be possible, so as not to collide with upcoming elections for the European parliament. This was a major concession by May, who has insisted that not only is her Brexit deal the best and only one on offer, but that it would be reckless to delay leaving the European Union beyond March 29. \u2026 Now May is offering compromise in a series of possible votes, each one based upon the results of the one before.\u201d -- India launched an airstrike into Pakistan-controlled territory in retaliation for the terrorist attack earlier this month that killed 40 Indian paramilitary officers in Kashmir. A spokesman for Pakistan's military said there were no casualties, while the Indian foreign ministry said there were \u201ca large number of casualties.\u201d\u00a0Joanna Slater reports: \u201cIndia\u2019s foreign secretary, Vijay Gokhale, told reporters that the strike targeted a training camp run by Jaish-e-Muhammad, the Pakistan-based militant group that claimed responsibility for the attack this month. ... Gokhale ... said the Indian strike was based on \u2018credible intelligence\u2019\u00a0that further attacks were being planned by Jaish-e-Muhammad, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States.\u00a0He called the strike a \u2018preemptive action\u2019\u00a0specifically targeting Jaish-e-Muhammad that was \u2018conditioned by our desire to avoid civilian casualties.\u2019\u201d GET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b Australian Cardinal George Pell, one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church, was convicted of sexually assaulting two 13-year-old choirboys.

(Lindsey Bever) TRUMPING THE EMERGENCY DECLARATION:\u00a0 -- Members of the House spent the day preparing to advance the resolution of disapproval that could overturn Trump\u2019s emergency declaration \u2014 temporarily, anyway. GOP leaders pushed their members to fall in line to keep the final vote tally low, even though it is all but certain to pass the lower chamber. Erica Werner reports: \u201cWhile Democrats tried to focus on the constitutional issues at stake in Trump using an emergency declaration to get border-wall money denied by Congress, Republicans trained their arguments on what they called dire conditions along the border that necessitated Trump\u2019s move. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Monday evening that he wasn\u2019t sure how many Republicans would vote for the resolution, \u2018but there will not be enough to override any veto.\u2019\u201d -- The outcome in the Senate remains uncertain. Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Thom Tillis (N.C.) are, so far, the only Republicans who have said they are likely to\u00a0vote to overturn Trump\u2019s declaration.\u00a0Tillis, who has a tough reelection fight on his hands next year, explains\u00a0his position in an op-ed for today\u2019s Post: \u201cAlthough Trump certainly has legitimate grievances over congressional Democrats\u2019 obstruction of border-security funding, his national emergency declaration on Feb. 15 was not the right answer. ... If I were the leader of the Constitution\u2019s Article II branch, I would probably declare an emergency and use all the tools at my disposal as well. But I am not. I am a member of the Senate, and I have grave concerns when our institution looks the other way at the expense of weakening Congress\u2019s power. It is my responsibility to be a steward of the Article I branch, to preserve the separation of powers and to curb the kind of executive overreach that Congress has allowed to fester for the better part of the past century. I stood by that principle during the Obama administration, and I stand by it now.\u201d -- A group of 26\u00a0Republican former members of Congress signed an open letter\u00a0opposing the declaration. John Wagner reports: \u201cThe letter argues that Trump is encroaching on Congress\u2019s \u2018power of the purse\u2019 and urges current lawmakers to stand up for its constitutional powers. \u2018We who have served where you serve now call on you to honor your oath of office and to protect the Constitution and the responsibilities it vested in Congress,\u2019 says the letter.\u201d\u00a0Its signers are\u00a0former senators John Danforth (Mo.), Chuck Hagel (Neb.), Gordon Humphrey (N.H.), Richard Lugar (Ind.) and\u00a0Olympia Snowe (Maine) and 21 former House members. --\u00a0Trump, who has promised to veto a rejection of his emergency declaration, warned Republicans against defecting.\u00a0\u201cBe strong and smart,\u201d\u00a0he tweeted, \u201cdon't fall into the Democrats \u2018trap\u2019\u00a0of Open Borders and Crime.\u201d Reality check: The House will probably pass the disapproval resolution. Even if the Senate follows suit, however, Trump has promised to veto the measure, and there aren\u2019t enough votes in Congress to override such a veto. The issue is likely to be tied up in the courts a long time, however. THERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Almost certainly alluding to Bob Mueller\u2019s impending report, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein argued that the Justice Department should not reveal information about people it does not charge with crimes. Matt Zapotosky reports: \u201cRosenstein conceded there \u2018may be legitimate reasons for making exceptions,\u2019 but he felt the Justice Department generally should be sensitive \u2018to the rights of uncharged people.\u2019 \u2026 The comments seem to foreshadow what could be a grueling legal battle between Congress and the Justice Department over what information about Mueller\u2019s work ultimately is released. The regulations that govern Mueller\u2019s work require him to submit to the attorney general a confidential report detailing whom he charged \u2014 as well as who was investigated and not charged. The attorney general is then to notify Congress that Mueller\u2019s investigation has ended. The regulations do not require the attorney general or Mueller to make significant details public, although they do not prohibit officials from doing so.\u201d\u00a0 -- Paul Manafort\u2019s attorneys urged a judge last night to sentence Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman to less than 10 years in prison, arguing that he has been treated harshly by the special counsel and unfairly vilified. Spencer S. Hsu and Rachel Weiner report: \u201cManafort \u2018is presented to this Court by the government as a hardened criminal who \u2018brazenly\u2019 violated the law and deserves no mercy. But this case is not about murder, drug cartels, organized crime, the Madoff Ponzi scheme or the collapse of Enron,\u2019 the attorneys wrote in a memo filed in U.S. District Court in Washington. \u2026 The defense said Manafort was unduly singled out for prosecution by the special counsel\u2019s office for \u2018garden-variety\u2019 financial crimes and \u2018esoteric\u2019 foreign lobbying disclosure violations but not, they said, on charges that showed any links between the Russian government or individuals and the campaign. \u2026\u00a0The two wide-ranging conspiracy charges to which Manafort pleaded guilty in Washington carry a maximum sentence of 10 years. \u2026 Manafort\u2019s attorneys asked for any sentences to run concurrently. \u2018In light of his age and health concerns, a significant additional period of incarceration will likely amount to a life sentence for a first time offender,\u2019\u201d his attorneys said. -- Although Mueller\u2019s name has captured headlines, it has been one of his lead prosecutors, Andrew Goldstein, who has questioned Trump\u2019s associates and negotiated with his attorneys about a potential interview. The New York Times\u2019s Noah Weiland and Michael S. Schmidt profile the former high school teacher and Time magazine reporter: \u201cMr. Goldstein, the lone prosecutor in Mr. Mueller\u2019s office who came directly from a corruption unit at the Justice Department, has conducted every major interview of the president\u2019s advisers. \u2026 And he was one of two prosecutors who relayed to the president\u2019s lawyers dozens of questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior in office that Mr. Mueller wanted the president to answer under oath. The questions showed the Mueller team\u2019s hand for the first time: extensive, detailed lines of inquiry that could imperil the presidency. \u2026 \u201cAs evidence built over two years, Mr. Goldstein functioned as a repository of conversations that Mr. Trump had with lawyers, advisers and top law enforcement officials from early 2017 on. Among Mr. Goldstein\u2019s jewels, according to Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers: exhaustive notes taken by Annie Donaldson, Mr. McGahn\u2019s former chief of staff, which detailed in real time Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior in the West Wing. \u2026 Like Mr. Mueller, Mr. Goldstein wears starched white dress shirts to work and prizes secrecy. Mr. Goldstein told a friend, Tim Lear, that Mr. Mueller even complained to his prosecutors about being photographed near Donald Trump Jr. at an airport.\u201d Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, leaves Capitol Hill on Thursday. (Susan Walsh\/AP) -- Michael Cohen plans on telling lawmakers that Trump repeatedly asked him about a skyscraper project in Moscow long after securing the Republican nomination, Reuters\u2019s Nathan Layne and Ginger Gibson report:\u00a0\u201cCohen\u2019s assertion that Trump was inquiring about the project as late as June 2016, if true, would show Trump remained personally interested in a business venture in Russia well into his candidacy. Cohen, scheduled to report to prison in May, has already said he briefed Trump on the project in June 2016. ...\u00a0In addition, Cohen will offer new information on Trump\u2019s financial statements that \u2018have never been produced before\u2019\u00a0relating to how Trump represented the values of his assets in financial transactions and other matters,\u201d according to a person familiar with the matter. -- Here are some other questions Cohen might answer during his testimony on Wednesday, as compiled by\u00a0Matt Zapotosky and\u00a0Rosalind S. Helderman:\u00a0 \u00a0-- House investigators are probing the president\u2019s contacts with then-acting attorney general Matt Whitaker after reports that Trump asked\u00a0Whitaker whether\u00a0U.S. attorney Geoffrey Berman\u00a0could un-recuse himself to intervene in Cohen\u2019s case. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Rebecca Ballhaus and Dustin Volz report:\u00a0\u201cThere is no sign Mr. Whitaker acted on any request from Mr. Trump \u2026 But the House Judiciary Committee is investigating whether Mr. Whitaker may have perjured himself in his appearance before the panel earlier this month, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Mr. Whitaker told the panel: \u2018At no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel\u2019s investigation or any other investigation.\u2019 Any evidence that Mr. Trump sought to intervene in the federal prosecutors\u2019 probe could propel further lines of inquiry by lawmakers into whether he has tried to obstruct the investigation into his business dealings.\u201d -- The Trump Organization asked the House Judiciary Committee to stop investigating the company, accusing the panel of hiring a lawyer with a conflict of interest. John Wagner and Tom Hamburger report: \u201cIn a letter Monday to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), Trump Organization lawyer Alan S. Futerfas objected to the committee\u2019s hiring of Berry H. Berke on the grounds that his law firm, Kramer Levin, has represented the Trump Organization on an array of issues. \u2018This state of affairs violates recognized ethical obligations and irreparably taints the Committee\u2019s work,\u2019 Futerfas wrote \u2026 In a statement, Kramer Levin called the Trump Organization\u2019s letter to Nadler \u2018baseless\u2019 and said Berke\u2019s consulting work for the Judiciary Committee \u2018complies fully with all applicable ethical rules, does not pose any conflicts of interest and respects any obligations the firm may have.\u2019\u201d -- Trump has asked his outside legal team to remain with him as investigations continue to unfold. The Daily Beast\u2019s Asawin Suebsaeng and Erin Banco report: \u201cThe president broached the topic of keeping his team together starting late last year, according to two sources familiar with the exchanges, by discussing other legal woes he might face after the Special Counsel\u2019s Office submits its report to the Department of Justice. Trump\u2019s focus at the time? The Southern District of New York. \u2026 Despite all the bustle surrounding the submission of a Mueller report, sources close to the president say Trump\u2019s legal team remains focused on pending matters in New York, as well as preparing for whatever other legal fallout could come stemming from Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\u201d -- Washington\u2019s Prettyman Courthouse has become a public stage for the Mueller investigation. On days when Trump associates are questioned, more than\u00a0a hundred people\u00a0routinely line up to catch a glimpse of the action. Avi Selk reports: \u201cThe people came for Roger Stone\u2019s hearing, as they have been coming to other Trump confidant hearings in this building for months \u2014 sleuthing for clues, or awaiting grand jury smoke signals, or simply compelled to be proximate to what could be the most potent criminal case since Watergate. \u2026 There were people in matching blue suits, in sloganed sweatshirts and sneakers. One man brought a guitar case for reasons unknown. Court security guards impersonated bouncers, snatching forbidden camera phones out of the queue and turning handbags inside out. Snippets of hazy, speculative chatter issued from the queuers, as if they were in line at a movie theater discussing the fate of some character: \u2018I hope Roger gets a taste.\u2019 \u2018Roger is looking for the next piece.\u2019 \u2026\u00a0The courthouse is also where Mueller\u2019s grand jury regularly convenes behind closed doors with no public warning, weighing evidence the public may never see, making decisions that could affect the United States for years to come.\u201d ANOTHER ACCUSER: -- A former staffer on the president\u2019s 2016 campaign has filed a lawsuit in which she claims Trump forcibly kissed her before a Florida rally. The White House denies it.\u00a0Beth Reinhard and Alice Crites report: \u201cIn interviews and in the lawsuit, Alva Johnson said Trump grabbed her hand and leaned in to kiss her on the lips as he exited an RV outside the rally in Tampa on Aug. 24, 2016. Johnson said she turned her head and the unwanted kiss landed on the side of her mouth. In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed Johnson\u2019s allegation as \u2018absurd on its face.\u2019\u00a0\u2018This never happened and is directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eye witness accounts,\u2019\u00a0she wrote. Two Trump supporters that Johnson identified as witnesses \u2014 a campaign official and Pam Bondi, then the Florida attorney general \u2014 denied seeing the alleged kiss in interviews with The Washington Post. \u201cAs recently as May 2017, Johnson spoke glowingly of Trump in a radio interview. \u2018He is more incredible in person than I think you would even think as you see him on TV,\u2019\u00a0she told the Alabama-based program \u2018Politics and Moore.\u2019\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s just the nicest guy. \u2026\u00a0He treats everyone as if they are a part of his family.\u2019\u00a0She also said she expected to be given a job as the \u2018second-in-command\u2019\u00a0at the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon. \u2018I will at some point be heading over to Portugal to work in the embassy,\u2019\u00a0she said. The Post found the recording of the show after the first version of this story was published.\u00a0One of Johnson\u2019s lawyers, Hassan Zavareei, said that at the time of the radio interview, she was bound by a nondisclosure agreement and was \u2018saying what she thought Trump and his supporters wanted.\u2019\u00a0\u2026 \u201cJohnson said she told her boyfriend, mother and stepfather about the alleged kiss on the day that it occurred, an account all three confirmed to The Post. Two months later, Johnson consulted a Florida attorney; he gave The Post text messages showing that he considered her \u2018credible\u2019 but did not take her case for business reasons. The attorney gave Johnson the name of a therapist, whose notes, which The Post reviewed, reference an unspecified event during the campaign that had left her distraught. \u2026 Johnson, an event planner who lives in Madison County, Ala., is seeking unspecified damages for emotional pain and suffering. The federal lawsuit, filed Monday in Florida, also alleges that the campaign discriminated against Johnson, who is black, by paying her less than her white male counterparts. A campaign spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany, rejected that claim as \u2018off-base and unfounded.\u2019\u201d -- \u201cThe most legally significant aspect of Johnson\u2019s suit may ultimately be something the complaint does not explicitly address: the pervasive use of nondisclosure agreements by Trump during his campaign and in his Administration,\u201d\u00a0Ronan Farrow adds in the New Yorker. \u201cJohnson\u2019s suit is at least the sixth legal case in which Trump campaign or Administration employees have defied their nondisclosure agreements. Three of those actions, including Johnson\u2019s, were filed this month. ...\u00a0Legal experts said that Johnson\u2019s case, and the broader pattern of high-profile legal skirmishes over Trump\u2019s use of nondisclosure agreements, could produce significant legal rulings and affect the President\u2019s ability to enforce the contracts.\u201d -- Johnson\u2019s attorney\u00a0said Trump\u2019s reaction to the violence in Charlottesville helped persuade\u00a0her client to come forward. The Daily Beast\u2019s Olivia Messer reports: \u201cZavareei said that Johnson watched\u2014and suffered\u2014with each national controversy, including when Trump enacted a policy of separating migrant children from their parents coming into the United States without documentation. \u2018It made her feel like she had some responsibility, having worked on his campaign,\u2019\u00a0said Zavareei.\u201d Neil Gorsuch whispers to Elena Kagan during an event last October at George Mason University\u2019s Antonin Scalia Law School. (Katherine Frey\/The Washington Post) POWER PLAYERS: -- Justice Elena Kagan could cast the deciding vote in one of the year\u2019s biggest cases: whether the Bladensburg Peace Cross dedicated to Marylanders killed in World War I stays or goes.\u00a0Robert Barnes has a fun preview of oral arguments scheduled for tomorrow:\u00a0\u201cKagan has emerged as one of the Supreme Court\u2019s most powerful voices on the separation of church and state, often rebuking conservative colleagues for allowing government actions that she says favor one religion over another.\u00a0But the last time the justices considered the fate of a cross constructed on public land, Kagan was on the other side of the bench and on one side of the issue.\u00a0As President Barack Obama\u2019s solicitor general, Kagan successfully defended a cross in the Mojave National Preserve, convincing the court\u2019s conservatives that what she unwaveringly referred to as a \u2018war memorial\u2019 should remain as a tribute to the sacrifice of World War I dead.\u00a0\u2026 \u201cOne of only four women to serve on the Supreme Court, Kagan is the least in the public eye. Although she is consistently on the court\u2019s left, she crosses over more often than the better-known Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. But she is a favorite of those who follow and practice before the court. Lawyers who argue conservative causes say she is the justice most likely to probe the weak spots of their cases. And law professors across the ideological spectrum praise her clear and often colloquial writing style.\u201d\u00a0 -- Nikki Haley is launching a policy group as the former U.N. ambassador deflects questions about a potential 2024 presidential bid. Anne Gearan reports: \u201cShe insists she is not planning that far ahead, even as her range of activities suggest she is keeping her options open. \u2026 The organization\u2019s initial list of subjects reflects Haley\u2019s conservative worldview and political instincts, while its website features photographs of Haley traveling the world as U.N. ambassador and taking questions in the White House briefing room. The group\u2019s policy positions mostly align with Trump\u2019s, while also bearing echoes of traditional Republican views that have taken a back seat during the populist-flavored Trump era. She is tougher rhetorically on Russia than\u00a0her former boss usually is\u00a0and says she disagrees with Trump\u2019s preference for punitive tariffs as a negotiating tactic in trade disputes.\u201d -- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has undergone a transformation from Trump\u2019s virulent 2016 primary opponent to one of the president\u2019s biggest backers, isolating some of his colleagues in the process. Mark Leibovich (of \u201cThis Town\u201d\u00a0fame) profiles Graham for Sunday\u2019s\u00a0New York Times Magazine: -- Former Fed chair Janet Yellen said she does not believe Trump understands macroeconomics. \u201cI doubt that he would even be able to say that the Fed\u2019s goals are maximum employment and price stability, which is the goals that Congress have assigned to the Fed,\u201d\u00a0Yellen said in a Marketplace interview. \u201cHe\u2019s made comments about the Fed having an exchange rate objective in order to support his trade plans, or possibly targeting the U.S. balance of trade. And, you know, I think comments like that shows a lack of understanding of the impact of the Fed on the economy, and appropriate policy goals.\u201d\u00a0(Politico) THE REST OF THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:\u00a0 -- The Senate blocked a bill that would have punished doctors for failing to provide full medical care to a child born alive after an attempted abortion. Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201cAll but three Democrats voted against a procedural motion on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, denying it the necessary 60 votes to proceed. \u2026 The bill includes criminal penalties, a right of civil action for an affected mother and a mandatory reporting requirement for other health providers. Opponents of the bill argued that it represented an unjustified attack on abortion rights, preventing doctors from exercising their best medical judgment and exposing them to possible lawsuits or prosecution. \u2026\u00a0Several medical groups, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Women\u2019s Association and the American Public Health Association \u2026 have publicly opposed the bill ... The Republican push to pass these bills follows efforts in New York and Virginia to roll back restrictions surrounding late-term abortions. -- A federal judge said the bump-stock ban enacted by the Trump administration can stand.\u00a0Meagan Flynn reports: \u201cU.S. District Judge Dabney L. Friedrich found that the Firearms Policy Coalition and other groups did not put forth any convincing legal arguments in favor of stopping the Trump administration from carrying out the ban, which targets a device used in the 2017 Las Vegas massacre, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\u00a0Friedrich, a 2017 appointee of President Trump to the District of Columbia, ruled it was \u2018reasonable\u2019\u00a0of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to conclude that a bump-stock, which uses the recoil energy from a rifle to automatically fire the next round, performs the same function as a machine gun and should therefore be banned just like machine guns under federal law.\u201d -- Several House Democrats requested information from the Pentagon on how it screens military recruits after service members were recently arrested in cases involving white supremacy. The lawmakers asked how these recruits were able to circumvent the military\u2019s checks with their extremist views, which they said posed a \u201csignificant concern, particularly given their combat and weapons training.\u201d (Dan Lamothe) --\u00a0A 24-year-old Honduran woman\u2019s pregnancy ended in a stillbirth while she was being held at an ICE detention center. Reis Thebault reports: \u201cThe woman ... was arrested near Hidalgo, Tex., on Feb. 18. She was six months pregnant at the time. Four days later, she went into labor and delivered a premature and unresponsive baby boy. Local doctors pronounced the newborn dead soon after. \u2026 ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection doesn\u2019t count stillbirths as in-custody deaths; rather, they\u2019re recorded in their own category, along with miscarriages. \u2026 The stillbirth will probably raise new questions about ICE\u2019s policy of detaining pregnant women, which changed from a \u2018presumption of release for all pregnant detainees\u2019 after an executive order from President Trump directed the agency \u2018to enforce the immigration laws of the United States against all removable aliens.\u2019\u201d -- Border officials didn\u2019t receive guidance on\u00a0the \u201czero tolerance\u201d\u00a0policy until after\u00a0Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen enacted it. From BuzzFeed News\u2019s Hamed\u00a0Aleaziz: \u201cThe guidance was delivered May 4, 2018, nearly a month after then-attorney general Jeff Sessions announced that Justice Department prosecutors would charge all individuals who crossed the southern border without authorization under a zero tolerance policy. Even then, the memo appeared to leave some room for confusion among officials, who said they would apply \u2018common sense\u2019\u00a0until additional clarification and guidance was issued.\u201d -- The Interior Department has given offshore oil drillers nearly 1,700 waivers to Obama-era safety regulations put in place after the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil disaster. From Politico\u2019s Ben Lefebvre: \u201cThe waivers mostly focused on 53 provisions of the final Obama-era rule that took effect at the end of July 2016 and which the industry had complained were the most burdensome. The Trump administration has begun to ease those provisions under its own rulemaking that began in May 2018. Those revisions are currently under review at the Office of Management and Budget. \u2026 BP, Chevron, Hess, Anadarko Petroleum and other companies that had applied for roughly 1,300 Gulf drilling permits during the 20-month period \u2026 More than a third of the 1,679 waivers granted during those 20 months allowed companies to deviate from regulations concerning tests that companies must perform on blowout preventers.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will reportedly release 10\u00a0years of tax returns. (John Bazemore\/AP) 2020 WATCH: -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced she will not participate in a high-dollar fundraising program during her bid for the Democratic nomination. \u201cCandidates spend too much time with wealthy donors, and I\u2019ve made a decision to change that,\u201d she wrote in an email to supporters. \u201cThat means no fancy receptions or big money fundraisers only with people who can write the big checks. It means that wealthy donors won\u2019t be able to purchase better seats or one-on-one time with me at our events.\u201d Reading between the lines: \u201cWarren has acknowledged in her fundraising emails that she hasn\u2019t achieved her online targets, a problem confirmed by a person familiar with her campaign\u2019s finances,\u201d Annie Linskey reports. \u201cThe move will provide Warren\u2019s camp with a ready-made excuse if her first-quarter fundraising totals are lower than expected. Those figures are released in mid-April and are traditionally seen as an early gauge of a candidate\u2019s strength. \u2026 Closing the door to high-dollar events will put even more pressure on her to come up with smaller contributions.\u201d -- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he has already raised $10 million since announcing his bid last week. The\u00a0New York Times\u2019s Shane Goldmacher reports: \u201cBut perhaps just as daunting a figure for his rivals is this: Nearly 39 percent of those donors used an email address that had never before been used to give to Mr. Sanders. For Mr. Sanders, the flood of money from fresh email addresses suggested to his team that he was dramatically expanding a donor network that had already dwarfed his 2020 competition.\u201d -- Bernie is also preparing to release 10 years of his tax returns, according to the National Journal\u2019s Hanna Trudo:\u00a0\u201cThe display of personal financial transparency goes well beyond what the Vermont independent did during his 2016 presidential bid, when he failed to produce a comprehensive look at prior returns. \u2026 Sanders brought in roughly $1.75 million in book royalties across 2016 and 2017, on top of his $174,000 Senate salary. But he still ranks among the least wealthy senators, according to the most recent public data.\u201d -- During a CNN town hall last night, Sanders praised Trump for his willingness to meet with Kim. The senator\u00a0also pledged to support the Democratic presidential candidate, no matter who it ends up being, and said that learning about allegations of sexual harassment within his campaign was very painful. He promised it \u201cwill not happen again.\u201d (CNN) -- Trump\u2019s former deputy campaign manager David Bossie is using a collection of endorsements\u00a0from prominent Maryland Republicans for the president\u2019s reelection campaign\u00a0to discourage Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) from a 2020 primary challenge.\u00a0Jenna Johnson, Robert Costa and Arelis R. Hern\u00e1ndez report: \u201cBossie, who is one of two Republican National Committee representatives for Maryland, spoke at the Montgomery County GOP Convention on Saturday. There he met privately with allies of the president to discuss assembling a statement that would send a clear signal to Hogan (R) about Trump\u2019s support in the state as the governor mulls a 2020 bid \u2026 the statement, which is not yet finalized, is expected to express support for Hogan as governor while fully backing Trump in the 2020 presidential election. \u2026 Hogan criticized Bossie\u2019s attempt to divide Republicans in his state. \u2018These kind of heavy-handed tactics are not what we need in our politics. We should be focused on encouraging discussion and debate, not seeking to divide,\u2019 Hogan said.\u201d -- Hillary Clinton is not running in 2020, but her presence is still felt. From the Times\u2019 Shane Goldmacher and Lisa Lerer: \u201cWhether it is building or deepening a relationship with Mrs. Clinton \u2014 or navigating or repairing a long-term one \u2014 the men and women in the 2020 race must grapple with how the 2016 nominee will factor into the next 18 months.\"\u00a0Not everyone has reached out to Clinton, including Bernie Sanders, Beto O\u2019Rourke and, more notably, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. According to a Clinton strategist, she doesn\u2019t plan on endorsing a primary candidate but will support the eventual nominee.\u00a0 -- Democratic campaigns are grappling with whether they should pursue the Rust Belt states that Trump carried in 2016 or chase Sun Belt states trending purple. The Times\u2019s Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns report: \u201cThere is a growing school of thought that Democrats should not spend so much time, money and psychic energy tailoring their message to a heavily white, rural and blue-collar part of the country when their coalition is increasingly made up of racial minorities and suburbanites. \u2026 The dispute is not merely a tactical one \u2014 it goes to the heart of how Democrats envision themselves becoming a majority party. The question is whether that is accomplished through a focus on kitchen-table topics like health care and jobs, aimed at winning moderates and disaffected Trump voters, or by unapologetically elevating matters of race and identity, such as immigration, to mobilize young people and minorities with new fervor.\u201d -- On the other side of the aisle: Major GOP donors fear Trump will not be able to hold on to Rust Belt states in 2020. Politico\u2019s Anita Kumar and Maggie Severns report: \u201cLate last month, more than 100 major Republican donors gathered at the Trump International Hotel for a presentation from the president\u2019s campaign manager Brad Parscale and other top political hands on their plans to keep the White House in 2020 after a brutal midterm election. \u2026 According to two attendees, campaign officials acknowledged that Trump is under-performing in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, though they said he is holding steady in Florida and trending upward in Ohio. But they offered no details on what they're doing to regain ground in the Midwest, the attendees said.\u201d -- Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is making an early play for the support of grass-roots groups in South Carolina. The State\u2019s Emma Dumain reports: \u201cIn interviews with nearly a dozen S.C. advocacy groups \u2014 many of them local chapters of national progressive organizations \u2014 representatives report they so far only have heard from the campaign of [Harris]. Harris\u2019 strategy has been to reach out to these groups early, long before anyone is prepared to offer an endorsement, in hopes of laying the groundwork for future support. \u2026 So far, the strategy is paying off. Activists in the traditionally conservative state are excited about being courted, listened to and valued.\u201d -- Former White House official Anthony Scaramucci said Trump would be worried if former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg runs for president.\u00a0Scaramucci said Bloomberg is \u201cthe one that the president would be quietly worried about\u201d because he has the \u201cmental discipline\u201d to handle challenges posed by Trump. Bloomberg, a registered Democrat, hasn't announced his intention to run yet, but fellow billionaire Warren Buffett already said he will support his bid. (CNBC) THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- Vice President Pence announced new sanctions against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in the Trump administration\u2019s latest effort to force the autocratic leader out of office. Anne Gearan, Anthony Faiola and Carol Morello report: \u201cPence arrived in [Bogota, Colombia] to reiterate that Washington will not back away from diplomatic confrontation. His trip comes as some in the Venezuelan opposition have begun openly calling for the use of 'force' to oust Maduro\u2019s socialist government. Pence did not publicly back immediate military force, but he reiterated a long-standing administration stance that all options were being considered. \u2026 Pence later acknowledged to reporters that Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 has sought assurances that the United States could use force if necessary, but the vice president did not set a red line for that decision or hint at what he would recommend to Trump.\u201d -- Univision journalist Jorge Ramos and his team were detained at Maduro's presidential palace after showing him a video of Venezuelans eating out of a garbage truck, Ramos said.\u00a0Reis Thebault, Michael Brice-Saddler and Eli Rosenberg report: \u201cThe group was freed shortly after, said Daniel Coronell, Univision\u2019s president for news in the United States. Coronell said Venezuelan government officials confiscated the journalists\u2019 equipment. Ramos, in a phone interview with Univision after he was released, said the interview with Maduro lasted about 17 minutes. 'He didn\u2019t like the things we were asking him about the lack of democracy in Venezuela, about torture, political prisoners, the humanitarian crisis that they were living,'\u00a0he said. ...\u00a0Ramos said the interview they recorded was also taken.\u201d\u00a0 This is the video that Ramos said upset Maduro:\u00a0 -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad made an unannounced visit to Iran to discuss U.S. policy with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani. From the AP\u2019s Nasser Karimi and Albert Aji: \u201cIran\u2019s semi-official Fars news agency said Khamenei told the visiting Assad that \u2018the buffer zone that Americans are after in Syria is among dangerous plots that should be rejected,\u2019 and that the U.S. plan to maintain a presence in Syria near the Iraqi border \u2018is another sample of their designs.\u2019 \u2026 Assad accused the U.S. and its regional allies like Saudi Arabia of creating rifts among various religious and ethnic groups in Syria, saying such efforts have backfired.\u201d -- Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif abruptly resigned, via Instagram. Erin Cunningham and Carol Morello report: \u201cThe move by Zarif, a well-liked diplomat both at home and abroad, could upend Iran\u2019s foreign policy at a critical time for the Islamic republic, which is suffering from renewed U.S. sanctions. \u2026 The reason for Zarif\u2019s resignation was not disclosed. Nor is it clear whether top Iranian officials will accept the resignation, and there were immediately conflicting reports about whether President Hassan Rouhani had already rejected it. \u2018He has handed in his resignation, but that doesn\u2019t mean that this is the end of this story,\u2019 said Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council in Washington. \u2026 Zarif\u2019s departure may be rooted in domestic issues, rather than foreign policy, because there are no significant prospects for negotiations on either Iran\u2019s nuclear program or on the issues of concern to Europeans and Americans.\u201d -- U.S. senators predict a vote on whether to end U.S. involvement in Yemen as soon as next week. From Reuters\u2019s Patricia Zengerle: \u201cOfficials from the U.S. State and Defense Departments met with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee behind closed doors on Monday to discuss the situation in Yemen, amid a months-long outcry in Congress about Saudi Arabia. \u2018I don\u2019t think they won any hearts and minds,\u2019 Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told reporters as he left the briefing. Critics of Riyadh, including some of President Donald Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, have blasted a Saudi-led coalition waging an air campaign in Yemen\u2019s civil war over high civilian casualties.\u201d -- China's Xi Jinping is nervous about the multiple major risks the Communist Party faces this year.\u00a0The New York Times's Chris Buckley reports: Xi \u201cabruptly summoned hundreds of officials to Beijing recently, forcing some to reschedule long-planned local assemblies. ... 'Globally, sources of turmoil and points of risk are multiplying,'\u00a0he told the gathering in January at the Central Party School. At home, he added, 'the party is at risk from indolence, incompetence and of becoming divorced from the public.' ...\u00a0There are no political challengers on the horizon who could pose an immediate threat to the Communist Party or Mr. Xi. But his remarks made clear that especially in 2019 \u2014 a year of politically sensitive anniversaries \u2014 the party would aggressively extinguish sparks that could ignite protests and turbulence.\u201d\u00a0 -- Also nervous? U.S. businessmen in China. According to a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, two-thirds of U.S. businesses in China have suffered\u00a0as a result of the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. But there's still general support for the president's approach to Beijing.\u00a0Anna Fifield reports: \u201cTrump\u2019s constant exhortations for American businesses to move their operations back home, coupled with Chinese [Xi\u2019s] calls for 'self reliance,' have only exacerbated business concerns about a protracted trade war leading to what is sometimes called economic 'decoupling'\u00a0\u2014 the world\u2019s two biggest economies trying to separate from each other...\u00a0Still, the American companies generally felt that the pain would be worth it if the Trump administration could force China to make structural changes in its economy that would create better business conditions.\u201d -- The Post is launching a fellowship in honor of the paper\u2019s late contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi Arabian writer and activist Hala Al-Dosari was named the first recipient of the fellowship, which offers a platform for journalists who come from parts of the world where freedom of expression is restricted. -- Israel leader Benjamin Netanyahu's opponent Benny Gatz is surging in polls after joining forces with the country's second-largest opposition party. Alon Yakter and Mark Tessler explain why: \u201cGantz\u2019s centrist political party, Blue and White, leads the opposition despite being particularly vague on Israel\u2019s most important ideological cleavage: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In what has become something of a joke, Gantz has both stated that he would seek peace through compromise with the Palestinians and has run graphic ads boasting of the damage inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza during his time as head\u201d of the Israel Defense Forces.

It called out the stuffiness of ESPN\u2019s analysts and exposed network executives for having an extramarital affair \u2026 As its national profile grew exponentially, it also suffered from charges of sexism and homophobia, crossing journalistic lines and moral lines \u2014 with few apologies. \u2026 These days, the most shocking and paid-for scoops in sports typically are found at TMZ, while a coterie of other outlets and reporters thoroughly cover ESPN and provide the media criticism Deadspin made famous. Deadspin has evolved into an unabashedly progressive voice in sports and beyond. \u2026 Deadspin is currently for sale by parent company Univision, but even as it wrestles with the uncertain economics of digital media, there is a more fundamental question for the site.

Her desperate family won't give up,\u201d by Kate Hodal:\u00a0\u201cThere is no single database that tracks the number of Native women who go missing or are murdered every year. But FBI figures show that Native Americans disappear at twice the per capita rate of white Americans \u2013 despite comprising a far smaller population. Last year, after more than two dozen Native Americans, most of them women, went missing in Montana alone, state senator Jon Tester declared the number of missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW) across America an \u2018epidemic\u2019\u00a0and vowed to find solutions.\u00a0\u2018People ask me: \u201cWhy are these women going missing?

But school district organization in states such as\u00a0Maryland and Virginia make funding more equitable.\u00a0Laura Meckler reports: \u201cThe problem is worse in states where districts are small, cordoning off wealthy communities and limiting the likelihood that wealthier taxpayers will subsidize poorer students, said Rebecca Sibilia, EdBuild\u2019s chief executive. In states such as Maryland and Virginia, she said, many school districts are comprised of entire counties, making funding more equitable. In Maryland, 880,000 students are served by just 24 districts, vs. New Jersey, where 1.3 million students are divided between 540 districts. Nonwhite districts in Maryland received $501 more per student than white districts, and in Virginia, they got $255 more per student.\u201d\u00a0 VIDEOS OF THE DAY: Trevor Noah rounded up\u00a0all the stories about alleged\u00a0sex crimes\u00a0making headlines worldwide:\u00a0 Stephen Colbert shared what Trump's golf simulator might look like if it were programmed in the interest of national security:\u00a0 The group Republicans for the Rule of Law released a video criticizing Trump's emergency declaration:\u00a0 Rep.

Not long before Kim arrived, a notice was distributed to the press corps that the filing center would be moved to a separate filing center for the international press corps at the Cultural Friendship Palace. ...\u00a0That left the U.S. press contingent scrambling to make the move. Television network producers had spent weeks setting up cameras, lights, monitors and other equipment shipped halfway across the world.

From the board rooms to the factory floors, there is consensus: This is no way to treat the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy. The nail-biting final days have triggered anxiety and division across Britain. But the complete incertitude is especially mind-boggling for British businesses. Companies have been forced to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on contingency planning. Others have had to cut jobs or delay expansions or idle production. Some are already giving up on Britain and moving their operations elsewhere. \u201cBrexit uncertainty has already done enormous damage to output, investment and jobs,\u201d said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a trade group representing more than 800 automotive companies. Britain\u2019s auto-manufacturing industry is in a swoon, with weekly announcements of job cuts at Jaguar, Honda and Vauxhall. The distress is related to an economic slowdown in China and Europe\u2019s move away from diesel. But the absence of clarity on Brexit is also playing a role. \u201cBrexit is the clear and present danger,\u201d\u00a0Hawes said. Ahead of the 2016 referendum, many businesses campaigned to remain in the E.U., the world\u2019s largest and richest trading bloc. Others said they wanted to leave, complaining that Brussels bureaucrats \u2014 aided and abetted by France and Germany \u2014 undermined their competitiveness and Britain\u2019s ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the United States. In some ways, so far, Brexit has been better for the British economy and British business than mainstream economists had anticipated. The pound has slid but hasn\u2019t crashed. The gross domestic product managed a 1.4\u00a0percent rise in 2018 \u2014 the weakest since the financial meltdown of 2008, but not the recession some had forecast. But no one wanted\u00a0this: days from the Brexit deadline, without a clue about how or when or if. The British Parliament has once overwhelmingly\u00a0rejected the withdrawal agreement negotiated over two years between the E.U. and Prime Minister Theresa May. Her party whip isn\u2019t confident they have the votes to pass the tweaked deal when Parliament takes it up again on Tuesday.\u00a0 Unless Britain requests and the E.U. approves an extension, the default legal position is that the nation will \u201ccrash out\u201d of Europe\u2019s enormous single market and regulatory regime on March\u00a029. Free and frictionless trade could come to a halt. Britain could find itself suddenly branded a \u201cthird country\u201d under E.U. trade rules, subject to quotas, tariffs and border-control inspections. Might the prime minister\u2019s deal squeak through Parliament this week? Might Britain push to delay Brexit? Might the stalemate continue until there\u2019s no choice but to call for a second referendum?\u00a0 May warned Parliament on Friday that rejecting her deal again could mean \u201cmore months and years arguing. If we go down that road, we might never leave the E.U. at all.\u201d For modern businesses, operating in the lean, just-in-time delivery ecosystem, this is a problem. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything, and I don\u2019t know anything because they have left absolutely everything until the last moment,\u201d said Charlie Allen, managing director of Shiner, a Bristol-based skateboard distributor that promises \u201cguaranteed stock\u201d and \u201ctimely replenishment.\u201d Some high-profile companies decided soon after the 2016 referendum to begin shifting their European headquarters out of London. They hoped to avoid potential tax issues (something electronics company\u00a0Panasonic cited), or they feared data flow disruptions (of obvious concern to tech companies), or they wanted to secure E.U. market access (a particular worry in the financial sector). Although London is expected to maintain its claim as the financial capital of Europe, the accounting firm EY estimated in January that financial services companies had moved $1 trillion in assets to other European cities. \u201cDublin is our headquarters for our European bank now \u2014 full stop,\u201d Anne M. Finucane, Bank of America\u2019s vice chairman, told the\u00a0Financial Times\u2019s European Financial Forum last month. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a return. That bridge has been pulled up. .\u2009.\u2009. From a trading perspective, likewise, Paris would be the European trading arm.\u201d Alexandra Renison, head of trade policy at the Institute of Directors, a lobbying group for business leaders, said a recent survey of its members found that a third had relocated part of their operations outside of Britain or were considering it. Those firms that thought they\u2019d stick it out, or that don\u2019t have the sort of business that can pick up and move, are now in frantic contingency-planning mode as they wait to see whether Brexit might sort itself out \u2014 or whether things are about to get really bad. If Parliament rejects May\u2019s withdrawal deal on Tuesday, lawmakers are supposed to vote Wednesday on whether to embrace leaving the E.U. without a deal. If they decide they still want to try for a managed withdrawal, they\u2019re expected on Thursday to vote on whether they want to delay Brexit. May\u2019s center-right Conservative Party traditionally represents business interests in Britain. But fighting within its ranks has prevented majority agreement on most courses of action. Almost all businesses in Britain are united against a no-deal Brexit. A coalition representing 190,000 companies has warned that crashing out would be \u201can unparalleled act of self-harm.\u201d \u201cPlease don\u2019t listen to the Brexiteers\u2019 madness, which asserts that, because we have huge plants here, we will not move and we will always be here,\u201d Airbus chief executive Tom Enders said in a\u00a0video message. \u201cThey are wrong.\u201d The aerospace giant employs more than 14,000 people in Britain and countless more in its supply chain. Meanwhile, British manufacturers are stockpiling raw materials at a record pace, according to\u00a0research\u00a0from IHS Markit\/CIPS, which tracks the sector. Supermarket chains have ordered extra food. Drug companies are booking space on charter planes so they can fly in vital medicines. Cross-border transportation companies have been among the most vocal about their fears over what happens next. \u201cWhen our members say, \u2018Tell us what\u2019s going on,\u2019 we say, \u2018We don\u2019t really know.\u2019 It\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d said Rod McKenzie, a spokesman for the trade group\u00a0Road Haulage Association. Among the open questions is whether truckers crossing the English Channel could suddenly be required to hand over customs documents \u2014 a dramatic change that would create complications and delays. \u201cLet\u2019s take one theoretical lorry,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cIt has 8,000 packages in it \u2014 books, bath plugs, all sorts of things. Each one would require a separate form being filled out in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Imagine how long it would take? \u201cIt\u2019s extremely frustrating \u2014 the quality of information the British government has supplied to businesses is shockingly bad.\u201d Carolyn Fairbairn, head of the Confederation of British Industry, a lobbying group composed of Britain\u2019s largest companies, said businesses are desperate for clarity. If Brexit is delayed, as many believe is likely, Fairbairn said, \u201cmore time must not mean more gridlock \u2014 a clear plan is needed.\u201d It is small firms that are especially vulnerable \u2014 the companies that don\u2019t have the resources to stockpile months and months of goods or set up a subsidiary in continental Europe just in case.\u00a0 \u201cUncertainty is not good for business,\u201d said Keith Kyle,\u00a0managing director at YardMaster, a company based in Northern Ireland that makes metal garden sheds, about half of which are sold in continental Europe. Sales have been going well, and he\u2019d like to expand. But he has tapped the brakes on investment plans because of the Brexit fog. \u201cIf there\u2019s going to be new tariffs between us and customers in France and Germany, why would we build extra production capacity here? The logical thing would be to build that capacity closer to your customers. It doesn\u2019t make sense to expand until you see a more secure way to move forward,\u201d he said. Kyle worries that a no-deal Brexit could produce chaos \u2014 for example, that he would no longer be able to receive an order on a Friday and get it to Germany on a Tuesday. But, like some here, he wonders whether perhaps the prime minister will get a deal through after all, thus avoiding major disruptions to business. \u201cMaybe we aren\u2019t hearing the whole thing and she will pull a rabbit out of the hat at the last minute. That\u2019s the only thing we can understand, that she is deliberately running down the clock to avoid other issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very risky strategy. A lot of people\u2019s livelihoods are at risk just for brinkmanship.\u201d","135":"But this is no ordinary farm. The food grown on these\u00a0acres\u00a0in southern Russia\u00a0is produced with one main\u00a0customer\u00a0in mind:\u00a0the metals magnate Oleg Deripaska,\u00a0whose power in his home district resonates like that of a modern-day feudal lord. His riches paid for the district\u2019s schools, kindergartens, churches, rural gas pipelines and sports facilities, and\u00a0trips to Paris for his former teachers. He has negotiated\u00a0agreements specifying how his\u00a0tax money is spent.\u00a0The district court consistently rules in his favor. His home \u2014 and the adjoining hotel, offices, employee residences and farm \u2014 occupy an entire village in southern Russia. \u201cHe likes domestic, traditional kinds of sausage. They\u2019re fatty, of course,\u201d said Deripaska\u2019s farm manager, Ralf Dreeris.\u00a0The recipe for a Ukrainian-style sausage that Dreeris makes was given to Deripaska by Ukraine\u2019s ousted pro-Moscow president,\u00a0Viktor Yanukovych. The immense wealth and influence of the men known as oligarchs, who won control of assets after the fall of the Soviet Union, is one of the hallmarks of modern Russia. Here in the district of Ust-Labinsk \u2014 a swath of plain where Deripaska grew up, and which he still calls home \u2014 the union of riches and privilege in President Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia may have reached its apogee. \u201cThey call this district his property,\u201d said Alexander Savelyev, who also hails from this mostly rural area and works as a journalist and at the regional office of the opposition activist Alexei Navalny. \u201cHe can do whatever he wants here.\u201d\u00a0 The U.S. Senate last month upheld a Trump administration move to lift sanctions on Deripaska\u2019s companies after he reduced his stake and stepped down from their boards, sending share prices back up. The many critics of the deal in Washington claimed that Deripaska, 51, still retained control of the companies, and questioned the propriety of easing the penalty on a figure on the fringes of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Deripaska\u2019s ties to Paul Manafort, President Trump\u2019s now-jailed former campaign chairman and a former consultant to Yanukovych, stoked speculation that Deripaska may have played a role in linking the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.\u00a0 In a statement to The Washington Post, Deripaska called the allegations \u201cbeyond absurd\u201d and said he had no contact with Manafort for more than seven years. \u201cWhile I realize I\u2019ve involuntarily become a lightning rod for the anger some Americans have about the elections result, they need to look elsewhere for a scapegoat,\u201d Deripaska said. \u201cI am nobody\u2019s man, in Russia, the U.S., or anywhere else, for that matter.\u201d In April 2018, the United States\u00a0imposed sanctions on him in response to Russia\u2019s \u201cworldwide malign activity,\u201d costing Deripaska billions as his companies\u2019 stock price cratered.\u00a0 Weeks earlier, social media posts emerged showing a self-proclaimed sex expert known as Nastya Rybka and Deripaska relaxing on his yacht with a Russian deputy prime minister. Deripaska then sued Rybka \u2014 whose real name is Anastasia Vashukevich \u2014 in the Ust-Labinsk district court. A favorable verdict\u00a0arrived within 29 minutes,\u00a0along with a rare order forcing Instagram to take down the posts that irked Deripaska. In Ust-Labinsk, few people seemed willing to criticize Deripaska. Not even the priest who leads Deripaska\u2019s congregation. \u201cIf he did something somewhere that was morally or ethically wrong, then that is his personal problem,\u201d said the Rev. Grigory Gureyev. \u201cThe man takes care of his home region.\u201d Gureyev preaches at the Deripaska-built Church of St. Vladimir. Deripaska\u2019s father, Vladimir, is buried in the adjacent graveyard. An architect on Deripaska\u2019s staff who specializes in churches designed it as a replica of the Church of the Intercession on the Nerl, one of Russia\u2019s most famous medieval buildings. Another staff member procured a rare relic of Saint Demetrios of Thessaloniki. In the district\u2019s main town, Ust-Labinsk, population 40,000, Deripaska is building a boarding school. The central quad\u2019s columned arcade is already complete, set against the town\u2019s vegetable-oil-extraction plant and the grain elevator.\u00a0 \u201cHe believes that classical architecture, in particular, allows schoolchildren, in particular, to study academic subjects more deeply,\u201d said Yury Ryabchenyuk, who heads Deripaska\u2019s economic development fund focused on the region. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a campus. This is an Italian palazzo.\u201d The surrounding small-town roads don\u2019t radiate Roman grace. So Deripaska will also help pay to renovate the streets in the boarding school\u2019s vicinity. Public officials in Ust-Labinsk at times described themselves as stewards and executors of Deripaska\u2019s wishes rather than as decision-makers in their own right. They spoke in interviews set up by Deripaska\u2019s foundation after The Washington Post reached out to the foundation regarding a story about Ust-Labinsk. \u201cI\u2019m like the manager, dealing with things like infrastructure,\u201d said Ust-Labinsk\u2019s mayor, Sergey Vyskubov. Referring to Deripaska in the respectful patronymic form, he added: \u201cOleg Vladimirovich thinks much more long-term, in terms of strategic projects.\u201d Deripaska has negotiated agreements with regional authorities specifying how his tax money is to be spent. One of his long-term interests is kaizen \u2014 a Japanese business-management approach emphasizing continuous improvement. A kaizen suggestion box greets visitors to City Hall, and even the kindergartens are designed according to the philosophy\u2019s teachings.\u00a0 Other projects appear to come together on a whim. Last spring, after a meeting with the governor, Deripaska ordered his staff to come up with a comprehensive plan to get children in the Krasnodar region, which includes Ust-Labinsk, to play rugby. He had played the sport growing up.\u00a0 Over the summer, Deripaska\u2019s staff brought in professional rugby players to teach the rules to Ust-Labinsk gym teachers. They bought uniforms and equipment. They hired a former member of Russia\u2019s national team to help run the program.\u00a0By the start of the school year in September,\u00a0eight Ust-Labinsk schools were offering rugby classes. He also persuaded his old karate teacher, Pavel Pisarenko, who years ago emigrated to the United States, to come back to Ust-Labinsk from Colorado Springs to head a new martial arts center.\u00a0 In the village of Oktyabrsky, Deripaska had his grandmother\u2019s one-story wooden house preserved to look just like it did when she was alive \u2014 down to the napkins.\u00a0 Deripaska moved to Moscow for university and became a metals trader after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Starting out with a stake in a Siberian smelter, he built one of the world\u2019s largest aluminum conglomerates. Along the way, according to the Treasury notice announcing sanctions against him last year, Deripaska \u201chas been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering.\u201d Deripaska has denied those allegations, but he\u2019s been open about his support for Putin \u2014 and the Kremlin has supported him. As recently as 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov asked then-Secretary of State John F. Kerry for assistance in getting Deripaska a U.S. visa, The Post reported. In a written statement, Deripaska said that he considered Ust-Labinsk home and that he spent more time there than in Moscow.\u00a0 \u201cOur efforts are a drop in the ocean,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil the residents of the district start to get involved themselves, fundamentally, nothing will change.\u201d\u00a0 The area has come to rely on Deripaska\u2019s money. He paid for the seed and fertilizer for the children\u2019s sugar-beet cultivation contest and for the sand for a village beach volleyball court. When the director of the district history museum heard about a site where the invading Germans may have massacred local Jews in World War II, he asked Deripaska\u2019s foundation for funding to examine it.\u00a0 The museum director, Furkat Baychibayev, said it was a no-brainer to seek money from the foundation rather than the local government. \u201cIt\u2019s a more flexible system,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Although the U.S. Treasury lifted sanctions on his companies, Deripaska himself remains banned from doing business with any Americans. Sanctions helped cut Deripaska\u2019s wealth to $3.6\u00a0billion from $6.7\u00a0billion in the past year, according to Forbes.\u00a0 The sanctions have been felt in Ust-Labinsk, too. Deripaska\u2019s effort to bring foreign companies into an industrial park he built in the district broke down after the U.S. sanctions were announced, Ryabchenyuk said. So did a deal to buy a combine harvester from John Deere, according to Dreeris, the farm manager. Dreeris said Deripaska has been spending more time on the property lately and has shown interest in expanding his farming operation. It already boasts plums, apricots, 56 varieties of apples, dairy and beef cows, quail, rabbits, a food-safety laboratory and an animal-feed processing plant. Much of what Deripaska doesn\u2019t consume is sold in local markets. \u201cIt\u2019s said that the locals eat what the oligarch eats,\u201d Dreeris said. \u201cIt\u2019s very prestigious for them.\u201d","136":"U.S. stocks capped a day of choppy trading with an uneven finish Monday as investors wrestled to make sense of newly pessimistic outlooks for the global economy. Traders also weighed another troubling drop in long-term bond yields, which many see as a warning sign of a possible recession. Large-company stocks ended broadly lower, led by drops in big technology companies. Apple fell 1.2 percent after announcing several new services including streaming video and news. Small-company stocks fared better. The bout of volatile trading left the S&P; 500 index slightly lower, extending the benchmark index\u2019s losses from a broad market sell-off last week. \u201cToday\u2019s moves are very reflective of very different interpretations of the environment and risks ahead,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. \u201cDifferent investors and different investment shops are interpreting the data very differently.\u201d The S&P; 500 dropped 2.35 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,798.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14.51 points, or 0.1 percent, to 25,516.83. It was down as much as 130 and up as much as 100 earlier in the day. The Nasdaq composite lost 5.13 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,637.54. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks picked up 6.94 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,512.86. Major European stock indexes finished lower as uncertainty over Brexit continued. Despite the market\u2019s recent slide, the S&P; 500 index is still up more than 11 percent so far in 2019, an unusually strong start to a year. Stocks spent much of the morning wavering between gains and losses as investors weighed another downbeat outlook on the economy. Citing a global slowdown and trade conflicts, economists from the National Association for Business Economics collectively project that growth will reach a modest 2.4 this year and just 2 percent in 2020. That\u2019s in sharp contrast to the Trump administration\u2019s predictions that growth will accelerate in the coming years. Still, the economists say they think a recession remains unlikely any time soon. Worried investors have shifted money into bonds, sending yields lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slid to 2.40 percent from 2.45 percent late Friday. At one point, the yield had fallen to 2.38 percent, briefly triggering deeper declines in the stock indexes. The 10-year Treasury yield remains below the yield on the three-month Treasury bill, a worrying sign that in the past has preceded recessions. That \u201cinversion\u201d occurred on Friday and has spooked investors. \u201cReally, the things that are driving markets are the uncertainties about global growth and also about how the Fed is going to respond to the inversion of the yield curve,\u201d Tilley said. The market\u2019s recent skid follows what has been a strong start to the year on Wall Street as stocks rebounded from a steep slide at the end of 2018. The bull market for U.S. stocks recently marked its 10th anniversary and is now the longest of all time. Monday\u2019s shaky start to the markets came amid a lull in news on the tariffs war between the United States and China. Trade talks are due to resume Thursday in Beijing. U.S. stock indexes did not appear to have a significant move either way in response to news that the special counsel\u2019s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election concluded without finding evidence that the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia. Attorney General William Barr issued a summary of the report Sunday, in which Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not find evidence that President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia to influence the election. Mueller also reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice. Still, the end of the Russia probe alleviates some reasons for concern in the market, said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager with Globalt Investments. \u201cThe Mueller report, at the margin, is a net positive for the market, as it removes some degree of uncertainty, although some uncertainty remains about what the various and ongoing investigations will turn up,\u201d he said. Losses in technology and financial companies outweighed gains in consumer discretionary and industrial stocks Monday. Chipmaker Micron Technology dropped 2.6 percent, while Synchrony Financial slid 1.4 percent. Homebuilder Lennar climbed 3.6 percent to lead the consumer discretionary sector, while retailer L Brands picked up 2.6 percent. Apple\u2019s splashy announcement of new offerings, including a subscription TV service due to launch in the fall, failed to impress investors. The stock slid 1.2 percent after the consumer electronics giant disclosed details of its forthcoming Apple TV Plus and other services, including subscriptions for games and news. The company did not say how much Apple TV Plus, which will be ad-free, will cost or when exactly it will debut. The new service will put Apple in direct competition with big streaming services including Netflix and Amazon Video. Apple is pushing digital subscriptions as it searches for new growth amid declining sales of its iPhones, long the company\u2019s marquee product and main money maker. Airline shares declined as major carriers continued to cancel flights due to the grounding of Boeing 737 Max aircraft as federal regulators continue to investigate two deadly crashes involving the plane model. American Airlines fell 1.2 percent a day after the company said it will be canceling about 90 flights a day through April 24. The airline has 24 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in its fleet. Southwest Airlines, which has 34 Max aircraft, is canceling, on average, 130 daily flights. Its shares slid 1.3 percent. Boeing fared better, adding 2.3 percent. Energy futures finished mostly higher. Benchmark U.S. crude oil dipped 0.4 percent to settle at $58.82 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 0.3 percent to close at $67.21 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline added 0.6 percent to $1.94 a gallon, heating oil gained 0.7 percent to $1.98 a gallon and natural gas inched up 0.1 percent to $2.76 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold gained 0.8 percent to $1,322.60 an ounce, silver rose 1 percent to $15.57 an ounce and copper picked up 0.5 percent to $2.86 a pound. The dollar fell to 110.06 yen from 110.07 Japanese yen on Friday. The euro strengthened to $1.1312 from $1.1294.","137":"President Trump\u2019s economic advisers insist the shutdown their boss provoked wouldn\u2019t do significant harm to the economy. Evidence suggests otherwise. This week some new economic data points to nervousness about the economy. Bloomberg News reports: \u201cU.S. consumer confidence slumped in January to the weakest level since July 2017 as optimism on the economy soured during the longest-ever U.S. government shutdown. .\u2009.\u2009. The measure gauging consumer expectations slumped to the lowest since October 2016 while Americans\u2019 views on present conditions weakened for a second month.\u201d Now, the slide in consumer confidence began before the shutdown, to be sure. However, that slide coincided with another Trump blunder \u2014 the opening of a trade war and the ensuing market volatility. (Remember the stock market plunged in December and had the worst year in a decade.) Given that nearly 70 percent of the U.S. economy is consumer spending, a downturn in confidence and retrenchment in spending would be worrisome. That\u2019s what some outside economic groups are predicting: The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), an advocacy group, did a survey of its members. In addition to the drop in optimism, it also found expectations for lower sales in upcoming months. The Economic Advisory Committee of the American Bankers Association is predicting that consumer spending in Q4 will fall to a growth rate of 2.2 percent, down from 2.9 percent a year ago. Many retailers rely on that time of year \u2013 the holiday shopping season \u2013 for a huge chunk in their revenue. Is this a temporary glitch or a sign of a recession? \u201cExtended drops in consumer confidence are often harbingers of recession. But temporary ones do happen and are nothing to sweat about,\u201d said Austan Goolsbee, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s temporary. Government shutdowns do tend to drop consumer confidence but most shutdowns are short-lived so it rebounds quickly.\u201d Then again, we haven\u2019t had a president who intentionally created chaos and made ludicrous policy pronouncements. As former car czar Steven Rattner told me, \u201cJohn Maynard Keynes coined the term \u2018animal spirits\u2019 to recognize that not everything about how an economy performs is driven by policy actions. When consumer confidence falls, for example, it can have a material negative economic effect if Americans cut back on their spending.\u201d He added, \u201cIn extreme cases, expansions can become recessions.\u201d Two other factors are key as we look at the near-term economic outlook. First, the tax plan was a bust insofar as it did not deliver on the promised increase in wages and investment. Its temporary stimulus is wearing off and, with it, the certainty that good times will continue indefinitely. (The business cycle still exists.) Second, worldwide growth is slowing, especially in China and Mexico. If U.S. consumer demand slows and other countries buy less, we really will have downward pressure on the economy.

The Washington Post published a document that shows, for the first time, Warren\u2019s handwritten assertion that she was an \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d on a 1986 registration card she filled out for the Texas bar. Warren in recent days offered apologies for claiming Native American identity, first privately to the leader of the Cherokee Nation and then publicly. In forcefully populist language, Warren sought to carve out a distinctive position in the crowded Democratic field, citing achievements like the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which regulates banks and other financial institutions. Other Democrats are also speaking out on inequality, but Warren is hitting particularly hard on the notion of creating new operating rules for the capitalist system. \u201cIt won\u2019t be enough to just undo the terrible acts of this administration,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to just tinker around the edges \u2014 a tax credit here, a regulation there. Our fight is for big, structural change.\u201d During the roughly 45-minute speech, she repeatedly stressed her image as a fighter, linking her family\u2019s economic struggles to a promise to battle for middle-class Americans. Supporters hope that reputation will eclipse any image of her as someone who misrepresented herself as a Native American for years. But even some of those who attended the kickoff had concerns about the strength of her candidacy, given the identity issue and President Trump\u2019s aggressive campaign style. \u201cTrump is an intimidating guy to take on,\u201d said Hugh Stinson, 40, of Douglas, Mass., before the speech, adding that he hadn\u2019t decided whom to support for president. \u201cWarren has left herself open on a couple fronts to pile on. He loves dredging up Pocahontas,\u201d he added, referencing Trump\u2019s nickname for Warren. Others worried that the country isn\u2019t ready for a female president. \u201cI want a candidate who will win. It\u2019s a challenging time,\u201d said Pamela Baldwin, 55, of Arlington, who said she likes Warren as a senator but believes sexism will prevent a woman from becoming president in 2020. The president tweeted later Saturday about Warren\u2019s decision to enter the race, referencing the Texas bar registration card from 1986. \u201cWill she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore?\u201d wrote the president. \u201cSee you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign issued a statement Saturday saying Warren has been \u201cexposed as a fraud\u201d by claiming Native American ancestry. \u201cThe American people will reject her dishonest campaign and socialist ideas, like the Green New Deal, that will raise taxes, kill jobs and crush America\u2019s middle class,\u201d Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, said in the statement. The Green New Deal, supported by an array of Democrats, is a sweeping environmental initiative. Warren acknowledged in her speech that some view her ideas as unrealistic. \u201cThere will be plenty of doubters and cowards and armchair critics this time around,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBut we learned a long time ago that you don\u2019t get what you don\u2019t fight for.\u201d Warren was introduced by Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy, once seen as a potential 2020 presidential candidate himself, and Sen. Edward J. Markey, along with local officials whom Warren has backed. Supporters held signs reading \u201cPersist, Persist, Persist,\u201d while some munched on butter cookies with the same word. It became an unofficial Warren motto after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), in a 2017 incident, complained that she had been warned against continuing to speak on the Senate floor in violation of Senate rules, but \u201cnevertheless, she persisted.\u201d After the rally, Warren headed to Dover, N.H., a town of 32,000 with a long history in now-faded industries like shipbuilding. Several of those who braved the biting wind to hear Warren speak at the old City Hall were impatient with the attention on Warren\u2019s Native American ancestry claims. \u201cIf they are going to toss her out of the ring over that, then they aren\u2019t looking deep enough,\u201d said Sheri Clark Nadell, 58, a high school teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s a very superficial way of looking at things.\u201d Others cited Warren\u2019s explanation that a Native American background was part of her family lore. \u201cShe is in the exact same position as me,\u201d said Fay Scofield, 70. \u201cI was told ever since I was a young child that we are part Native American. I have no idea if it\u2019s true, but it\u2019s always been part of the family story, and we\u2019ve been proud of it. I\u2019m sure she was, too.\u201d At the Massachusetts event, Warren added some biographical elements, describing herself, as a young mother entering law school, having to quickly toilet-train her toddler so she could leave the child at a day-care center while she attended classes. And she blamed the divides in American culture on \u201cthe rich and powerful,\u201d saying the country\u2019s problems go beyond the current occupant of the White House. Warren has proposed an \u201cultra-millionaire\u201d tax that adds an annual 2 percent levy on wealth over $50 million and a 3 percent tax on those with assets worth more than $1 billion. She wants large companies to be more tightly regulated, requiring them to focus on more than stock prices and consider their employees and communities. And she wants workers included on corporate boards. \u201cWhen I talk about this, some rich guys scream, \u2018Class warfare!\u2019\u00a0\u201d Warren said. \u201cWell, let me tell you something \u2014 these same rich guys have been waging class warfare against hard-working people for decades. I say it\u2019s time to fight back.\u201d Warren did not refer to her Native American claims, but she repeatedly mentioned race and the added difficulties confronting minorities. Nonwhite voters made up more than a quarter of the Democratic primary electorate in 2016. \u201cRace matters \u2014 and we need to say so,\u201d Warren said, noting that blacks continue to face, for example, discriminatory housing practices. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t be blind to the fact that the rules in our country have been rigged against other people for a long time,\u201d listing women, gays and lesbians, Latinos, Native Americans, immigrants and people with disabilities. She got some of her biggest applause when she talked about her plan to change politics, repeating a pledge not to take money from special interests. \u201cI\u2019m not taking applications from billionaires who want to run a super PAC on my behalf,\u201d Warren said. She also backed a constitutional amendment to ensure the right to vote, and she advocated for tightening ethics requirements on members of Congress and even Supreme Court justices. Warren was the first major candidate to announce a presidential exploratory committee, sending out a video on New Year\u2019s Eve. Since then, the field has grown considerably, including her Senate colleagues Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Cory Booker (N.J.). It\u2019s expected to expand further Sunday, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) set to announce her bid. Warren has visited Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Puerto Rico. In coming days, she plans events in Georgia, South Carolina, Nevada and California. She is scheduled to be in Iowa on Sunday.","139":"A superbly tuned human machine on display in nothing but spandex is so seductive at the NFL Scouting Combine. All of the cool executive judgment and professional posture fall away in the face of a D.K. Metcalf, with his body-armor physique, the sinews in his legs and shoulders standing up like cords, and the torso \u2014 my God, the torso. Statistical studies consistently show there is pretty much zero correlation between a strong showing in the \u201cUnderwear Olympics\u201d and success in the NFL. And yet Metcalf sent the entire league and much of the Internet into a collective pant by flexing his abdominals, which look as if hand grenades have been stuffed under his skin. When, on top of that, the wide receiver out of Mississippi posted a time of 4.33 seconds in the \u00ad40-yard dash, he vaulted right to a high first-round draft pick, and perhaps deservedly. But in truth, the combine indicates nothing, no hard core analytics, about whether he will have a career. The only thing the combine is good for predicting is the NFL draft order. Several academics in recent years have sought mathematical proof of whether the cone drills, vertical leaps and other measurements can be extrapolated into success on the NFL field, and the answer is no. In 2008, a study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research by a team of University of Louisville scholars concluded: \u201cUsing correlation analysis, we find no consistent statistical relationship between combine tests and professional football performance. .\u2009.\u2009. Consequently, we question the overall usefulness of the combine.\u201d In 2011, analysts from the University of Georgia found very much the same and added this insight: Teams would be much better off watching game tape than players in singlets dashing around. \u201cPast performance, collegiate performance engendered a stronger relationship with future NFL performance than a variety of physical ability tests administered during the NFL combine,\u201d they wrote. \u201cUnlike physical ability, past performance remained a valid predictor.\u201d Yet another statistician at UC Berkeley in 2016 found that acing the 40-yard dash \u201cwill almost guarantee a prospect\u2019s entrance to the NFL.\u201d Yet he could establish only one \u201cfairly reasonable linear relationship\u201d between the combine speed drills and eventual NFL performance, and that was at running back. Otherwise, \u201cAs for building a statistical model from data used in this study, it was actively disappointing and, often times, a mixture of various techniques had to be conducted just to make sure that we were not making up stories.\u201d Making up stories \u2014 that\u2019s what a lot of team executives and scouts are doing at the NFL combine. All of the rigorous analysis shows that the combine is all but useless as a predictive tool. Yet these scouts and executives use it anyway to determine their draft orders.\u00a0 What does that say? It says they are as susceptible as the rest of us to the persuasive power and the Leonardo-like awe of the human form. It says we keep thinking we can take the exterior, visible measure of someone. Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray became the buzziest story of the combine, simply for standing an inch taller than anyone expected. Metcalf\u2019s rising\u00a0draft stock is based far more on his 6-foot-3 height, gasp-inducing shirtlessness and sprinting at the combine than anything on his game tape, of which there is precious little. He caught 67 passes in his college career before a neck injury sidelined him seven games into his sophomore season and he declared for the draft. Yet teams are entranced by him. \u201cYou got to ask yourself, \u2018Who\u2019s tackling this guy?\u2019\u2009\u201d Raiders Coach Jon Gruden said. What it also says is that a lot of teams are reluctant to work more counterintuitively. But in looking for a strong predictor, why not study the best team in football for the past 18 years, the New England Patriots? Here is a startling statistic: Seventeen players on their Super Bowl-winning roster, fully one-third of the team, never appeared at the NFL combine.\u00a0The heart of their roster was formed from uninviteds and rejectees. Super Bowl MVP wide receiver Julian Edelman is only the most obvious example.\u00a0The list includes almost the whole of their offensive line (including undrafted linchpin center David Andrews and guard Shaq Mason), half of their secondary (Duron Harmon, Nate Ebner, J.C. Jackson and Jason McCourty, who made the most critical pass breakup of the Super Bowl), special teams captain Matthew Slater and fullback James Develin.\u00a0 It\u2019s always fun to revisit the NFL\u2019s appraisal of tight end Rob Gronkowski at the 2010 combine, when he was an oft-injured tight end out of Arizona. \u201cDurability concerns. .\u2009.\u2009. Does not have great top-end speed and may not be able to stretch the field at the next level. Lacks the elusiveness to make people miss after catch.\u201d The Patriots made him a second-round pick anyway. There is something endlessly intriguing about the Patriots\u2019 method of assessing players, the ability of Coach Bill Belichick and director of player personnel Nick Caserio to see potential that other teams don\u2019t. It\u2019s unclear what their measurables and metrics are. But three things are obvious: They exercise perfect discipline when it comes to salary structure, they never allow their heads to be turned unduly by raw talent, and they have perfect faith in their ability to discover and develop undervalued gems. For 15 straight years, an undrafted rookie free agent has made the Patriots\u2019 53-man roster.\u00a0 As Slater said: \u201cObviously Coach Belichick and his staff have an idea in their minds of, \u2018This is what a Patriot is.\u2019 But I don\u2019t know how they identify it. I just know they find a lot of them.\u201d If you could identify it, if you could crack open the Patriots\u2019 book on player assessment, you\u2019d have the football grail. Here\u2019s another interesting predictor you won\u2019t get at the combine: Teams that invest heavily in finding undrafted free agents tend to succeed. In 2017, SB Nation writer Levi Damien did an analysis of the NFL teams that carried the most undrafted free agents on their rosters. The top six teams all had winning records, including the Patriots.\u00a0 If there is a moral to learn from the NFL combine, it\u2019s not that speed kills or that strength rules. It\u2019s that it\u2019s more important to find the right player than the \u201cbest\u201d player."}}
