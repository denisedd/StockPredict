McAfee said it found that the North Korean hackers have tried to infiltrate nearly 80 business in critical sectors like finance, telecommunications, energy and defense around the world. Governments themselves were also targeted, McAfee said.  The hacking is believed to have continued during US President Donald Trump's summit with Kim Jong Un. The largest number of recent attacks primarily target Germany, Turkey and the United Kingdom as well as the United States, McAfee said.   Pyongyang is believed to operate some of the most sophisticated hacking cells in the world, though the North Korean government has long denied any wrongdoing.  McAffee said it partnered with a \"government entity\" in its investigation, though it declined to reveal which government it worked with. The company said the hacking operation shared \"numerous technical links\" to the Lazarus Group, North Korean hackers believed to have been behind bank heists around the world.","1":"Srinagar, India (CNN)At least 37 people were killed Thursday afternoon when a bomb exploded near a convoy of Indian paramilitary personnel in Indian-administered Kashmir, one of the deadliest attacks in the disputed region in recent years. Bharat Bhushan, spokesperson for India's Ministry of Home Affairs, told CNN Friday that 37 soldiers had died, with five wounded.  Earlier reporting from CNN affiliate News 18 had the death toll at 40 but has since revised down to 37. The convoy, which was transporting members of the Central Reserve Police Force, was on the national highway when it was struck by a blast from an improvised explosive device, said Muneer Khan, the state's director general of police. \"One vehicle which was part of the convoy carrying the CRPF personnel bore the brunt of the blast resulting in multiple casualties,\" a police statement said. The Indian government has blamed a Pakistan-based terrorist organization for the attack. \"This heinous and despicable act has been perpetrated by Jaish-e-Mohammed,\" India's foreign ministry said in a statement. \"The Government of India is firmly and resolutely committed to take all necessary measures to safeguard national security...We demand that Pakistan stop supporting terrorists and terror groups operating from their territory and dismantle the infrastructure operated by terrorist outfits to launch attacks in other countries,\" the statement continued. Pakistan responds Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement hours after the attack, describing it as \"a matter of grave concern.\" \"We have always condemned acts of violence anywhere in the world,\" the statement said. It continued: \"We strongly reject any insinuation by elements in the Indian media and government that seek to link the attack to Pakistan without investigations.\" Jaish-e-Mohammed, which translates to the Army of the Prophet Mohammed, is a Pakistan-based group that operates on both sides of the border of the disputed state. The group, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the US State Department since 2001, seeks to unite the Indian-administered area of Kashmir with Pakistan. The attack took place in the Pulwama district -- about 15 miles (25 kilometers) from Kashmir's capital, Srinagar. Local media reported that militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed had claimed responsibility in a video statement circulating online. However CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the video. Indian PM condemns 'dastardly attack' India's Prime Minister responded to the attack and tweeted his support for soldiers in the state. \"Attack on CRPF personnel in Pulwama is despicable. I strongly condemn this dastardly attack. The sacrifices of our brave security personnel shall not go in vain. The entire nation stands shoulder to shoulder with the families of the brave martyrs. May the injured recover quickly,\" said Narendra Modi in a tweet. Modi has taken a stronger stand towards terrorism in the state since he came to power almost five years ago. In 2018, 253 terrorists were killed by Indian security forces -- more than double the number of terrorists killed in 2015, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs. India's finance minister, Arun Jaitley, also condemned the attack: \"Attack on CRPF in #Pulwama, J&K is a cowardice & condemnable act of terrorists. Nation salutes martyred soldiers and we all stand united with families of martyrs. We pray for speedy recovery of the injured. Terrorists will be given unforgettable lesson for their heinous act,\" tweeted Jaitley. Kashmir has had a tumultuous history ever since the India-Pakistan partition -- which resulted in a predominantly Hindu India and a Muslim Pakistan. After India gained independence in 1947, Kashmir has been bitterly contested by both India and Pakistan, resulting in three wars between the two countries and numerous other skirmishes. The attack on Friday comes more than two years after armed militants entered an army base in the garrison town of Uri, about 63 miles (102 kilometers) from Srinagar -- killing 18.  Separatist violence in the region has killed more than 47,000 people since 1989, although this toll doesn't include people who have disappeared due to the conflict. Some human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations put the death toll at twice that amount.","2":" (CNN)Seven executives of top pharmaceutical companies were grilled before a congressional panel Tuesday about the nation's skyrocketing drug prices, with one senator accusing Big Pharma of blaming everyone but themselves and another saying the execs were \"stonewalling\" in their answers.  The drama unfolded during a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, the largest gathering in decades of pharmaceutical executives before a congressional panel. Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking member of the committee, blasted Big Pharma as \"morally repugnant\" and accused the companies of operating in an \"unacceptable\" way. He grew testy when he believed the executives weren't being forthcoming about reducing list prices. \"All of this other stuff is window dressing,\" Wyden snapped. \"You are stonewalling on the key issue.\" At one point, he pressed the chairman and CEO of AbbVie, maker of the arthritis drug Humira, which, according to a recent New York Times story, has doubled in list price since 2012, from about $19,000 a year to $38,000. Wyden wanted to know whether the company makes money on drugs in Germany and other Westernized nations where patients pay, on average, 40% less than Americans. \"Yes, we do,\" CEO Richard Gonzalez said. If that's the case, Wyden said, \"you can do the same thing in the United States.\" \"How is that not gouging the American consumer?\" he asked. \"You are willing to sit by and hose the American consumer and give breaks to those overseas.\" Sen. Steve Daines, R-Montana, sought clarity on who ultimately pays for astronomically high list prices. The patients, he was told by the executives.  \"That is, to me, the biggest problem that we have as a country,\" Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier said, \"as we now have a system where the poorest and sickest are subsidizing others.\" Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley opened the hearing by criticizing pharmaceutical companies, saying that skyrocketing prices are hurting Americans and that the time has come for a reckoning. \"We've all seen the finger-pointing. Every link in the supply chain has gotten skilled at that,\" said Grassley, R-Iowa. \"But, like most Americans, I'm sick and tired of the blame game. It's time for solutions.\" The committee hearing was a rare display of bipartisanship at a time when the country remains mired in polarization. Grassley said after the more than three-hour hearing that he believed bipartisan legislation on drug prices could come out of his committee.  Six of the seven CEOs said they support legislation to require \"advance warnings\" of price increases, similar to a California law. The heads of AbbVie and AstraZeneca also said that any fixes would require legislative action by Congress, because the entire system can't fix itself. At other moments, the drug executives -- and some senators -- put the blame on pharmacy benefit managers and insurance companies as complicating the system and driving up prices.  Those answers didn't sit well with most panel members.  Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican from Georgia who has Parkinson's disease, said he'd recently gone to pick up one of his seven medications at a pharmacy, and one of the meds was $90 more than it was in December.  \"I said, 'how can that be?' \"  Within an hour, he said, the pharmacy came back with four prices for the same drug. He said it's \"tough\" to be an elected official if you can't explain drug prices to constituents. \"I can't explain the cost increases,\" Isakson said. \"We've got to get to the bottom of this.\" During one heated exchange, Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-New Hampshire, demanded answers from Johnson & Johnson for what she said was aggressively selling and marketing opioids. Chairwoman and Executive Vice President Jennifer Taubert seemed caught off-guard, defending the company's handling of opioids as \"very appropriate and responsible.\" \"It is hard for me to take the industry's goal here as promoting good health seriously when its behavior to maximize sales of opioids created an epidemic,\" Hassan replied.  Also testifying were Olivier Brandicourt, the CEO of Sanofi; Pascal Soriot, the executive director and CEO of AstraZeneca; Giovanni Caforio, chairman and CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb; and Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer. The executives said that if any changes to the system are implemented, they must be done in a way that doesn't hamper innovation and research and development. In his opening statement, Wyden ripped Soriot for complaining about his $12 million salary as \"the lowest-paid CEO in the whole industry.\" \"He said it was 'annoying to some extent,' \" Wyden said. \"His company, meanwhile, continues to raise the price of Symbicort,\" which is used treat asthma. The rising costs of drugs have become a hot political issue, with President Donald Trump vowing to take action to bring down prices and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle making similar pledges. \"America has a problem with the high cost of prescription medicines,\" Grassley said. \"We're all trying to understand the sticker shock that many drugs generate -- especially when some of those drugs have been around for a long time.\" He said he'd heard from people who leave their prescriptions on the pharmacy counter because the meds cost too much, and others who skip \"doses of their prescription drugs to make them last until the next paycheck.\" \"I'm not a doctor, but rationing one's medicine doesn't sound like a safe prescription for health and wellness,\" Grassley said. He acknowledged that drug pricing is a complex issue but then said, \"But I think we should all be asking: Should it be so complex?\" In an an opinion piece published Tuesday in the Des Moines Register, Grassley said he wanted answers to a simple question: \"Why do prescription drug prices keep rising?\" Last week, Grassley and Wyden began an investigation into insulin prices, sending letters to leading manufacturers Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi about their recent price increases of up to 500%. At the start of the hearing, Wyden said he was present decades ago when tobacco executives were called before Congress to explain themselves. \"They lied that day,\" Wyden said. \"This chairman and I expect better than that today.\" Sanofi's Brandicourt told lawmakers that there was no single cause for rising costs and that it was time to take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"I understand the anger,\" he said. More than 650 products had price increases this year, through early February, according to Rx Savings Solutions, which sells software to employers and insurers to reduce drug costs. The industry justifies the moves as essential for investing in research and development. Drugmakers often point out that they see very little of the increases because of the big rebates they distribute to others in the supply chain, including insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who in turn blame Pharma for setting high list prices. Among cost-saving ideas from the Trump administration, one suggests setting the reimbursement level for certain drugs administered in doctors' offices and hospital outpatient centers based on their cost in other countries, which typically pay far less. The so-called International Pricing Index model has faced blowback from many quarters, including some Republican lawmakers. Democrats have begun pushing a plan to allow the government to directly negotiate the prices of Medicare prescription drugs, saying that such a move could save billions of dollars. The pharmaceutical industry has long resisted such a change. Pfizer's Bourla said that his company was committed to reform but that any reform should take a look at all market segments. He said rising drug prices were causing hardships on Americans. \"This is forcing patients to forgo taking needed medications or to limit their doses,\" he said. \"This is bad.\" Grassley said it was an issue that is not going away, and he vowed to keep pressing.","3":" (CNN)Donald Trump's former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen testified in detail Wednesday about the President's involvement in hush-money payments to women and his knowledge of longtime confidant Roger Stone's efforts to contact WikiLeaks, while Trump's Republican defenders aggressively worked to undermine Cohen's credibility. Cohen's dramatic public testimony before the House Oversight Committee ping-ponged between Democrats who walked Cohen through the actions Trump took and Republicans who challenged Cohen over his financial crimes and past lies to Congress. Cohen's public testimony Wednesday was undoubtedly a spectacle, but its ultimate impact will depend upon whether Cohen's allegations are viewed as credible. Cohen's hearing comes while the President has his own big moment: Cohen is testifying about what he says are Trump's misdeeds while the President is in Vietnam meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Cohen also revealed that prosecutors in New York are investigating conversations between Trump and Cohen that occurred after Cohen's office was searched by the FBI in April 2018. In his testimony, Cohen explained how Trump instructed him to pay $130,000 to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump, which Trump denies. Trump then reimbursed Cohen as President for the payments, Cohen said \u2014 and he provided a copy of the check to show it. Cohen told the committee that there was \"no doubt in his mind\" that Trump knew he was paying Cohen for \"hush money payments.\" Further, Cohen testified that Trump had called him in February 2018 to discuss messaging surrounding the payment, where Trump directed him to lie about the President's knowledge of the payment. In his opening statement, Cohen launched a broadside against Trump, accusing him of being \"a racist,\" \"a conman\" and \"a cheat.\" Cohen also talked about how Trump discussed the Trump Tower Moscow project with him into the 2016 campaign \u2014 the topic that Cohen would ultimately lie to Congress about \u2014 and that Trump had knowledge of Stone's efforts to reach out to WikiLeaks ahead of the release of hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign. \"The last time I appeared before Congress, I came to protect Mr. Trump. Today I am here to tell the truth about Mr. Trump,\" Cohen said. Republicans attack Cohen's credibility Republicans pressed Cohen repeatedly on the crimes he pleaded guilty to, arguing he had no credibility having previously lied to Congress and that his own financial crimes \u2014 which he pleaded guilty to along with the campaign finance violations \u2014 had nothing to do with Trump. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, accused Cohen of turning against Trump after he did not get a job at the White House. \"You wanted to work in the White House, you didn't get brought to the dance,\" Jordan said. \"I was extremely proud to be the personal attorney for the President of the United States of America. I did not want to go to the White House,\" Cohen responded. But Republicans didn't buy Cohen's answer, pointing to court filings from the Southern District of New York that stated Cohen \"privately told friends and colleagues, including in seized text messages, that he expected to be given a prominent role and title in the new administration. Cohen insisted he didn't want a White House role, saying that prosecutors statement was \"not accurate.\" Cohen, in fact, was angling for the White House chief of staff job, according to a person who talked to him about it, and at one point there was a movement to push him into the White House counsel's office. The President suggested it to former White House counsel Don McGahn, but he said Cohen didn't have the necessary experience and background to work there, and Trump dropped it after that. Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, accused Cohen of lying in the hearing itself, pointing to documents he had filed with the committee on whether he had any foreign contracts. Cohen said he would review the form and amend it if necessary. The White House said ahead of the hearing it was \"laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word.\" Republicans hammered Cohen on the same theme, with one member calling Cohen \"a pathological liar.\" Another Republican asked Cohen what he would call himself if he had called Trump a cheat. \"A fool,\" Cohen responded. Jordan and Cohen continued to battle throughout the hearing. After one exchange with another Republican, Jordan exclaimed: \"His remorse is nonexistent!\" \"Shame on you, Mr. Jordan. That's not what I said,\" Cohen shot back. Preparing for his (false) testimony When it was the Democrats' turn to question Cohen, they gave him the chance to add new details about how he had prepared his previous congressional testimony, in which he lied, as well as the hush money payments and Trump's conversations with Stone. Cohen also disclosed new information when he said he could not discuss conversations with Trump that took place two months after the FBI raided his offices because they were still under investigation. The Manhattan US Attorney's Office, which prosecuted Cohen, is examining that conversation as well as other possible wrongdoing or illegal behavior by Trump, Cohen said. Cohen took his preparations for his 2017 congressional testimony into the White House, telling one Democrat that changes were made to his testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project when it was reviewed by Trump's lawyers. \"There were several changes that were made, including how we were going to handle that message,\" Cohen said. \"The message, of course, being the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed, and remained alive.\" Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, said committee staff had uncovered an email the White House had mistakenly released to lawmakers that revealed a meeting Trump had requested in May of 2017 with Cohen and Jay Sekulow, a member of the President's legal team, where Cohen said he discussed his upcoming testimony. Later, Cohen said he did not know who at the White House had edited his testimony, but that it had been circulated, including into the White House, because of a joint defense agreement. Cohen also revealed that he had discussed with Trump the public messaging surrounding the payment to Daniels, saying that he had \"purposefully\" left Trump out of a statement last year to reporters when he said the campaign and Trump Organization were not involved with the payment. And Cohen discussed the details of a phone call he said that he had heard between Stone and Trump, in which Stone told Trump that he had spoken by phone with Julian Assange and an email dump was coming that would hurt the Clinton campaign, according to Cohen. A broadside against Trump Cohen detailed several episodes involving Trump, from Trump arranging for the bidder of an auction for his portrait to when Cohen said he threatened Trump's high school, his college and the College Board not to release his grades or test scores. Cohen also took a shot at Trump for his medical deferments during the Vietnam War, saying he asked Trump for medical records to about his bone spur to explain it to reporters, but he was not provided any. \"I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now,\" Cohen said. Cohen provided new details claiming Trump was heavily involved in the pursuit of the Trump Tower Moscow project in 2016. \"To be clear, Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Tower negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it,\" Cohen said. \"He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.\" CNN reported in July 2018 that Cohen was willing to testify to the special counsel that Trump knew in advance about the planned meeting at Trump Tower. Cohen said that Trump did not \"directly\" tell him to lie to Congress, but that Trump would tell him personally and the public that he had \"no business\" with Russia, even as he was negotiating the Moscow project. \"In his way, he was telling me to lie,\" Cohen said. Battling over Cohen's allegations Republicans pushed back on the allegations. Meadows brought to the hearing Lynne Patton, an African-American Department of Housing and Urban Development official who worked with the Trump family before the campaign. She stood behind him and submitted a letter for the record, rebutting Cohen's claims about Trump being racist. Democrats argued that Republicans were trying to sweep Cohen's allegations under the table to protect Trump. House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, said that the new evidence Cohen provided \"raises a host of troubling legal and ethical concerns about the President's actions in the White House and before.\" Jordan said that Cummings' tenure would be marked by bringing in Cohen, whom he labeled a \"fraudster, a cheat, convicted felon and, in two months, a federal inmate.\" Jordan responded by charging that Cummings' tenure would be marked by bringing in Cohen, whom he labeled a \"fraudster, a cheat, convicted felon and, in two months, a federal inmate.\" Wednesday's hearing is the second of three congressional appearances for Cohen this week, after he appeared behind closed doors before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday and will do the same before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. Cohen's congressional appearances come before he is scheduled to report to prison on May 6 for a three-year sentence after he pleaded guilty to tax crimes, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress in 2017. Cummings said that he would not prevent committee members from asking questions about the Russia investigation at Wednesday's hearing. Cummings had originally said the scope of the hearing would not include Russia, but said at the hearing that after objections from Jordan, Russia questions were now within the scope of the hearing. Cummings said he was allowing the Russia questions also because Cohen made statements about the investigation in his written testimony, and because they \"do not raise concern from the Department of Justice.\" This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday and will continue to update throughout the day.","4":"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump is casting a wide net in the search for a new leader of the World Bank, one that, against all odds, has included the woman at the root of a bitter 2016 primary battle.  Trump interviewed Heidi Cruz, the wife of Sen. Ted Cruz, for the World Bank president job. Cruz currently works for Goldman Sachs as a managing director of the investment division in the company's Houston office. \"It was an honor for Heidi to be considered by the Administration as a finalist for President of the World Bank,\" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told CNN in a statement.  \"She was humbled to be among a strong list of other strong candidates to serve,\" Frazier added. The interview was first reported by Bloomberg, which noted Cruz is not expected to receive the job.  A contentious history It goes without saying that there is a complicated and contentious history between the Cruz family and the President following the bruising 2016 Republican primary.  In March of 2016, Trump expressed anger that an anti-Trump super PAC used an old photo of his wife Melania, a model who posed in the nude for a 2000 British GQ spread, in a provocative Facebook ad that read, \"Meet Melania Trump. Your Next First Lady. Or, You Could Support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.\" Trump accused Cruz's team of being behind the ad, which Cruz vehemently denied. Still, Trump took to Twitter, threatening that Cruz, whom he dubbed \"Lyin' Ted,\" ought to \"be careful\" or else Trump would \"spill the beans\" on his wife. Trump later retweeted a follower who posted an unflattering photo of Heidi Cruz alongside a glamour shot of Melania Trump, with the caption: \"no need to 'spill the beans' the images are worth a thousand words.\"  In return, Cruz, speaking at a sheet metal factory in Wisconsin, labeled Trump a \"sniveling coward\" and called on Trump to \"leave Heidi the hell alone.\"  Trump later expressed some regret over the incident. The couples appeared to mend fences and the Trumps invited the Cruz family for dinner at the White House in March of 2017. The Cruzes also had dinner with Ivanka Trump, who is leading the World Bank search, and Jared Kushner that September, per Politico. The President and Ivanka Trump also traveled to Texas in 2018 to support Cruz's Senate campaign.   Qualifications Heidi Cruz has a broad set of qualifications for the top post at the international development and sustainability group. She \"previously served as Economic Director for Western Hemisphere at the National Security Council, ran the Latin America group at the Treasury Department, closed large banking deals for companies in emerging markets, and has spent two decades as a banker in private finance,\" Frazier said. Cruz, a California native, also lived in Africa as a child, something Frazier said gave her \"a passion for the developing world and the power of free-market solutions to alleviate poverty.\"  The mother of two was a hesitant but frequent presence on the campaign trail, taking unpaid leave from her job at Goldman Sachs during the campaign and often introducing her husband to crowds of voters. She has since returned to Goldman Sachs. ","5":"Joshua A. Douglas is a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law who specializes in election law, voting rights, and constitutional law. He is the author of the forthcoming book, \"Vote for US: How to Take Back Our Elections and Change the Future of Voting.\" Follow him @JoshuaADouglas. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion at CNN.   As a professor of election law and voting rights at the University of Kentucky College of Law -- your state's flagship institution and your alma mater -- I invite you to come sit in on my election law class. Given your recent commentary on the subject, it might teach you a lot.   For instance, you can learn about the true merits of H.R. 1, the For the People Act, a proposed law that Democrats in Congress have introduced to completely revamp our elections. Yes, it would include a provision to make Election Day a federal holiday as part of a suite of reforms to improve voter turnout.  You mocked the holiday idea on the Senate floor this week (and in your recent Washington Post op-ed) while ignoring the comprehensive nature of the election reform package. You claim it's all part of a Democratic \"power grab.\" Senator, are you really afraid of more eligible people going to the polls?   The law includes many reforms -- like automatic voter registration, felon re-enfranchisement, improved election security, and methods to make voting more convenient -- that all amount to one thing: modernizing our election system for everyone.   What's more, the law would enact numerous ideas that are already working in various states and localities throughout the country.  It is aimed at bringing more eligible voters into our political process. In fact, several Republican-controlled states have enacted some of these reforms.   Take automatic voter registration, which is sweeping the nation. The idea is built on a simple premise: When the government already has information about voters, such as through the Department of Motor Vehicles office, it should simply add that information to the voter registration rolls. Voter registration is often an unnecessary barrier to voter participation, and states can eliminate that barrier by automatically registering valid voters in this way.   Far from a ruse that registers invalid voters (an assertion from your op-ed that the Washington Post later corrected), it would simply make it easier for more people to participate in our elections. In fact, automatic voter registration actually improves election integrity by helping states clean up their voter rolls.   In 2016, Oregon was the first state to adopt automatic voter registration, and the idea has now spread to places like Alaska, Georgia and West Virginia -- hardly Democratic strongholds. More than a dozen states have enacted automatic voter registration. Perhaps most impressively, this reform has led to improved voter turnout.   Sen. McConnell, your commentary also attacked H.R. 1's plans for campaign finance reform and greater disclosure of who is spending money in campaigns. You claim that with the bill, Democrats would be \"coming after free speech.\" Not so. Though you may oppose disclosure, the Supreme Court has declared that greater disclosure is the way to solve many of the problems of our campaign finance system and, in almost all circumstances, is perfectly legal under the First Amendment.   As for publicly funded Democracy Vouchers that voters can give to candidates to fund their campaigns -- used successfully in Seattle -- the idea is to insert more money into our political system. But instead of having wealthy interests and groups that obscure their identity flood our airwaves, Democracy Vouchers, as a form of public financing, would allow everyday Americans to have a say in who receives campaign funds and democratize who has the financial ability to run for office.   Ironically, you assert that \"Americans [don't] see an urgent need for their tax dollars to be used to bankroll robocalls and attack ads,\" yet in heralding Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United and supporting the deregulation of campaign finance, you seem to have no problem with more money being inserted into our political system so long as it comes from wealthy interests who can obscure their identities.   You also suggested it is a power grab to change the Federal Election Commission  from its current system of having three members appointed by each political party to having a 3-2 split. Right now the FEC is largely ineffectual, as it often deadlocks on a 3-3 vote (and right now it has only four members, the minimum for a quorum). Having an odd number of commissioners would help the agency actually enforce federal campaign finance laws. And the proposal would simply give an advantage to whichever party is currently in the White House, Republican or Democrat.   Now, there may be better ways to reform the agency, and perhaps giving the party in power more control might help them entrench themselves if they set out rules for the next election -- but that's true for both parties.   H.R. 1 also includes numerous other proposals that, once again, already work well in various states and localities. Everyday Americans -- such as the \"democracy champions\" I profile in my forthcoming book who have worked to improve our democracy through sustained advocacy for positive voting rights reforms -- desperately want these enhancements to our election system.   For instance, voters are clamoring for independent redistricting commissions, as the results of the five states to vote on the idea in 2018 showed: All five measures passed. That includes both red and blue states, like Utah and Michigan. Americans understand that voters should pick their politicians and not the other way around.   The proposed law would also restore the right to vote to felons who have completed their sentences, reversing a policy that harms minority voters in particular and strips millions of the core aspect of their citizenship. Plenty of states all across the country -- including Florida, this past November through a ballot initiative -- have eased their felon disenfranchisement rules.   In addition to declaring Election Day a national holiday, which, to be sure, has its own complexities, such as potentially harming hourly employees, the law would also expand early voting and vote-by-mail\/vote-at-home opportunities.   The law would require a verified paper trail to enhance the security and integrity of our election system.   It would improve access for voters with disabilities.   It would impose more rigorous ethics requirements on our public officials.   In sum, H.R. 1 would modernize America's election system for everyone. That should be the goal: let's make it easy for all eligible Americans to participate and allow the best candidates and best ideas -- and not election rules -- dictate the outcomes.   Sen. McConnell, I promise that my election law class presents a fair, unbiased overview of our election system and the numerous laws and regulations involved. We can debate the merits of some of the proposals in H.R. 1, but one thing is clear: States and localities are already seeing success with many of these ideas, modernizing their elections and bringing more people into the political process.   Isn't that something that all sides should want? Shouldn't everyone champion improved voter participation?   I invite you to the classroom anytime you are available.","6":"Washington (CNN)More than a month after the longest government shutdown in US history ended, a significant number of Transportation Security Administration employees still have not received all of the back-pay they are owed. The delay has been caused in part due to an unusual move during the shutdown to pay a partial paycheck to workers in order to help keep them on the job. TSA Administrator David Pekoske told employees at the time the decision was to \"alleviate some of the financial hardship many of you are facing.\" Hundreds of TSA workers called out from work during the shutdown and officials from the national TSA employee union said many of the callouts were due to financial hardship. According to a source with knowledge of the situation who was not authorized to speak to the media, more than 1,000 TSA employees are still waiting to be paid in full. The exact number is unclear as employees continue to come forward with complaints that they are still owed money from the shutdown.  During the partial government shutdown, which lasted from December 22 until January 25, CNN was first to report hundreds of TSA screeners were not showing up to work as it became more difficult to make ends meet for many employees without their usual paycheck. The staffing shortages caused long lines at some airports during the 35-day shutdown and even forced some of those airports to shutdown security checkpoints. When the shutdown ended, President Donald Trump said issuing back pay to federal employees would be the priority, and the Office of Management of Budget instructed agencies to prioritize repaying its employees. In a statement, TSA put the number of employees who have not been paid in full at about 1,000. \"Of TSA's 60,000 employees, approximately 1,000 throughout the country require some sort of pay correction,\" the agency's statement read. The agency says it continues to process those corrections, which mostly affect one pay period. The median TSA salary is less than $41,000, according to 2017 data and published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  RELATED: This shutdown is teaching a hard lesson about inequality in government service A TSA official who is \"frustrated with the situation\" said the delay in pay is a self-inflicted wound. The official, who spoke anonymously because they are not authorized to speak to the media, blames it on Pekoske's actions during the shutdown.  \"The problems are with pay period 26,\" the official said, referring to the final two-week pay period of 2018 that was partially paid as an incentive to try to keep workers who were calling out on the job. TSA said at the time that one week of back pay was paid out. \"It appears as though their effort to partially pay people screwed things up and they are still getting their act together,\" the source said. Following the publication of this story, Michael Bilello, the assistant administrator for public affairs at TSA, said agency leaders \"made the best decision given the circumstances.\" \"To help support our employee's during the 35 days of the lapse in funding, TSA processed partial payments to its frontline employees. Coincidentally, the payment was processed on the very same day the partial shutdown ended. Of the 60,000 employees, unfortunately, 2% have experienced pay discrepancies,\" Bilello said in an email to CNN. \"This partial payment was complicated by a payroll process that goes from TSA to the National Finance Center (NFC). TSA leadership assumed this risk and made the best decision given the circumstances and information at the time. TSA has contacted employees with known issues to ensure they are resolved.\" Discussed on call with TSA field offices The current problem with back pay was the subject of a phone call that TSA headquarters held with field offices across the country on Wednesday, according to a partial transcript obtained by CNN. On the call, Karen Shelton Waters, who oversees human resources issues at TSA headquarters, explained that the agency's help desk and the administrator himself have been overloaded with questions, concerns and complaints about the situation, according to the transcript. Waters is quoted in the transcript explaining the agency's understanding of why approximately 1,000 TSA workers have yet to receive full pay, pointing to the timing of the agency's decision to pay workers during the shutdown.   \"Pay period 26 was the partial pay that we did and then the remainder of that pay period should have been a correction that came through the system once the funding was restored,\" she said.  \"Our timing ... could not have been poorer in terms of when we executed partial pay. We actually got approval to do that almost simultaneously with the time funding was restored,\" she added. The result is an administrative mess. Now, the agency is working to make corrections in its system to reflect that employees have already received a partial payment so that the balance owed to them is accurate. \"If I give you a partial payment, I can't pay you more than you work,\" the first source explained. \"They need to go back and match what was worked and that all has to be done manually to make sure the difference owed to employees is accurate.\" The TSA official added, \"The administrator used FY18 money to partially pay TSA employees. This cheated the purpose of the shutdown. They were scrambling to keep people on the job because you had a number of sick outs taking place, but in fact, they created more problems for employees. And they're dealing with it one month after the shutdown is over.\" The National Finance Center, which handles human resources issues for TSA, did not respond to a request for comment. On the call, Waters gave out an email address where employees can flag problems to the agency, but it is unclear when TSA will successfully pay all of its employees in full.","7":"Craig Kielburger is co-founder of the WE Movement, a global organization that empowers young people to end child labor and break the cycle of poverty.   Sometimes it takes a child to raise a village -- or to take down an injustice.    When I was 12, I read about Iqbal Masih, a child slave who escaped the carpet factory where he'd been chained to a loom since the age of four. Iqbal led an anti-child labor crusade that made global headlines, including the one that first caught my attention.   \"Battled child labor, boy, 12, murdered.\" I was stunned. I was sitting at a breakfast table in small town, Ontario, Canada, with enough food to eat, a soccer coach and a comfortable life. Meanwhile, another boy my age had been gunned down in Pakistan for speaking out about the factory owners who bought him for $16 to settle a family debt. How could two lives be so different? I started calling anti-child labor organizations, asking how I could help. They told me a kid couldn't make any difference, so I decided to start a movement for young people to fight child labor, and to prove them wrong. You could call it the hubris of youth, except that it stuck.    A global network Twenty-four years later, the WE Movement is over 4 million strong, a global network of students and teachers in 16,000 schools across Canada, the US and the UK. Together, we work to move the needle on issues like child labor, local and global hunger, poverty, and more. Read: Child slaves risk their lives on Ghana's Lake Volta    Internationally, WE works in countries with high rates of child trafficking and bonded labor -- India, Kenya and Ethiopia among them -- using what's called our WE Villages development model. That's a holistic and sustainable approach that uses five pillars: education, health, clean water, alternative income programming and food security to help communities lift themselves free from the cycle of poverty to help ensure that no family faces the choice Iqbal's did: whether to sell a child into slavery.      Domestically, our greatest champions are young people. Students take action through WE Schools, our program that brings world issues into the classroom through acts of service.   In Elizabeth, New Jersey, 97 students from J. Christian Bollwage Finance Academy got together for an all-night relay walk in solidarity with children in Sierra Leone, who often drop out to take the daily job of hauling water for their families. Through the WE Walk For Water campaign, students collected $959 in pledges for clean water projects that keep kids at school instead of trekking to distant lakes and rivers.     A WE Schools club at Bird's Hill School in East Saint Paul, Manitoba, sold $2 ballots to vote on which teacher had to kiss a goat. Students raised $414, enough to provide eight women in developing communities with goats of their own, which offer nutritious milk and small business opportunities for livestock rearing.    With sustainable income and savings, parents don't have to pull children from school to work or leave them to take jobs outside the community. For every extra year a child spends in school, the UN estimates their future earnings increase 10 percent.  When you give a child the opportunity to learn, they always give back.   When I was young, I was told I'd have to wait until I was older to change the world. I'm sure kids today hear the same thing.   But the world needs young leaders now.   Three tips for young people taking action on child labor   1. Study up. Visit websites or hit the local library for books on child labor. You have to know the issue before you can make your actions count. Find out what causes it, who benefits from the system, and who suffers. Talk to other people about what you've learned.  2. Think global, act local. If the issue seems overwhelming, start small, and start at home. Find out where your clothes are made and by whom. Learn about the manufacturer's commitment and efforts to eliminate child labor from its supply chain. Explore the effects of poverty in your own community\u2014how they are similar or different to issues overseas. Volunteer at a local food bank or shelter. 3. Gift + issue = change. The biggest changes happen when young leaders apply their talents and passions for the causes they care about. What gets you up in the morning? Sports? Singing? Organize a charity music showcase or baseball tournament.   The WE Movement is looking for young people who want to get involved. We've got action campaigns and toolkits to support you in taking action for vulnerable communities around the world.    Every child deserves the freedom to get an education and pursue their dreams.   No one understands that better than another child. ","8":"London (CNN)When Donald Tusk, President of the EU Council, tweeted on Wednesday that there was a \"special place in hell\" for those who promoted Brexit without a plan, the reaction from certain corners of London was furious. Throughout the Brexit process, many in the UK have been apoplectic at the European Union's perceived arrogance and disrespect. But few have tried to appreciate why the EU has taken such a firm line.  It may be a cliche to say that Brexit presents an existential crisis for the EU as well as the UK. But, so the cliche goes, all cliches exist for a reason. The EU wants to get Brexit out the way so it can deal with the other problems currently facing the bloc -- and there are quite a few, not least the European parliamentary elections in May. Europe has endured a near-unprecedented migration crisis. The euro area is still recovering from the aftermath of the global financial crisis -- which hit Greece so hard it needed the largest bailout in history. It is coping with populist movements becoming increasingly powerful in national elections, forcing mainstream politicians to ape once-fringe political ideas. It has among its ranks countries like Poland and Hungary openly undermining the rule of law. And it is looking at Rome, wondering if -- maybe when -- Italy's sovereign debt mountain will collapse its economy, making Greece look like a walk in the park. With all that going on, it's little wonder the Brexit turmoil is frustrating European officials.  So why won't Brussels give in to UK Prime Minister Theresa May's demands, reopen negotiations and get Brexit over with? In the narrow terms of Brexit, the EU has to stand up for the interests of its members -- a position it has more or less stuck to since day one. But more broadly, the EU is not strong enough to be weak right now. 'Fake deadline' Few understand this paradox better than former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. \"What the UK has failed to understand is the weakness of the union and the single market, but also the enormous political will to keep it all together,\" he told me earlier this week. \"Only when you put the two together can you begin to understand the harshness the EU has demonstrated to London.\" He went on to describe the EU's signature tactic: the finite deadline. When Varoufakis was negotiating Greece's debt and austerity program in 2015, he had a mandate to push for a debt restructure. The EU did not want to negotiate on this, so imposed a deadline.  \"I was told if I missed the deadline, then Greek banks would close. Article 50 has created a fake deadline. Agree a deal by March 29, or leave with nothing. We all know we are going to die, but if we know the date, we will live every day up till that point in panic.\" That March 29 deadline is central to the Brexit debate in the UK. Despite the UK agreeing to this deadline, as per the terms of the Treaty of the European Union, many believe it will inevitably need to be delayed to avoid no deal. But this is far from Brussels' preferred option and, unfortunately for the UK, it is a matter entirely for the EU. Why doesn't the EU want to extend the deadline? A few reasons. First, there is not much appetite in Brussels to talk to a brick wall. Recent events in the UK parliament have led to a total erosion of trust. Despite the EU now seeing that offering some concession on the so-called \"backstop\" might see the UK parliament approve the deal, to tweak it would require reopening negotiations -- a huge climbdown -- and defying the wishes of EU member Ireland. And it's still not 100% clear this would be enough. Then there are those upcoming EU elections. The EU parliament is currently dominated by groups that hail from across the political spectrum, but are largely pro-EU. While this is not expected to change, current projections from Europe Elects point to the three largest groups losing seats. And that could have complicated consequences. \"Populists won't take over the new parliament, just smaller parties across the political spectrum will do better,\" Agata Gosty\u0144ska-Jakubowska, a senior research fellow at the Centre For European Reform think tank told me. \"But the European elections will create space for a populist movement to create pressure and gain more influence within the EU.\" What's that got to do with delaying Brexit? When asked what the biggest fear for the elections was, a source inside the EU Parliament replied: \"The Brits still being there.\" Should Article 50 be delayed beyond the date of the elections, then the UK could still have MEPs sitting in parliament. Some EU officials are concerned at the prospect of far-right figures like Tommy Robinson, standing, winning and building some form of \"anti-EU, populist supergroup,\" the source explained. The other issue with delaying article 50 is that it might cause fights over money between the remaining 27 EU nations. If the UK stays, it stands to reason that its budget contributions would have to increase from the current \u00a339 billion to insert your own number. And negotiations over the EU's long-term budgets, as Gosty\u0144ska-Jakubowska explained, \"can cause serious rows between the member states that are net contributors and those that are net recipients.\" The last thing the EU wants, after two years of unity on Brexit, is for cracks to appear in the final hours. The EU is in a funny spot. But its ongoing problems were misread by some in London as evidence that Brussels would bend over backwards to give the UK a far-reaching, free-trade deal in a matter of weeks. After all, Germany and Italy still want to sell the UK their cars and prosecco, right? Well, yes, they do. But while Europe has so many plates spinning, it's more essential than ever that the EU stands up for its principles and the interests of its own members. How, for example, could Brussels punish Poland or Hungary for undermining the judiciary in one breath then offer the UK a sweet trade deal the next? Place this alongside the feeling among some member states that the EU has already made too many concessions to a country that is walking away, and you get an idea of the bind Brussels is in. So, if a deal is to happen, what might that final push to achieve it look like? When Varoufakis spoke of the \"artificial deadline,\" he explained that the tough talk and hard deadlines laid the ground for an 11th-hour fudge that the EU could claim as victory.  Tusk's harsh words -- immediately replicated on Twitter -- might be a sign of what is to come. Watch the theater in the coming days like a hawk.","9":"Washington (CNN)Roger Stone is known for hyperbole, but his latest graphic warning should worry Donald Trump. The political trickster said Tuesday, a day he pleaded not guilty to seven charges laid by special counsel Robert Mueller, that Trump's presidency is in mortal peril because the Russia investigation amounts to a \"speeding bullet heading for his head.\" Stone's comment, to \"Breitbart News Daily\" on Sirius XM radio, added to soaring anticipation, fueled by a remark by acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker on Monday, that the probe could soon end with Mueller's final report. And it raised the question of whether Trump's repeated claim of \"no collusion\" fired off in scores of tweets and comments to the press, is a sufficiently broad defense to the existential threat that Stone perceives from Mueller's work. The indictment of Stone, Trump's longest serving political adviser, refocused attention on whether Trump and his team crossed legal and ethical lines during an effort to defeat Hillary Clinton in an election that featured a simultaneous Russian meddling operation. The key question for Mueller has always been whether there was a criminal conspiracy by members of Trump's team to cooperate with Moscow's bid to make him President. So far, he has offered no proof of such a bombshell finding, in a forest of indictments, court filings, one trial and convictions of people around the President in a probe that appears to be getting ever closer to the Oval Office. If Mueller does establish such behavior, it would answer the puzzling question: Why have so many people around Trump -- at great costs to themselves -- repeatedly lied about ties to Russians? Or, it's conceivable -- if the special counsel could conclude that though there was evidence of a cover-up -- it was not motivated by a desire to hide a crime, but was meant to spare Trump the political embarrassment of noncriminal links to Russia? But even if that is the case, Mueller's voluminous filings and other publicly available information have established a pattern of behavior by Trump and aides that tore at norms of behavior during campaign season and shows clear disrespect for the integrity of a presidential election -- part of the fabric of US democracy. It is likely to fall to the Democratic-led House to consider whether such activity is unethical and in such conflict with American values, that it merits further action -- potentially even impeachment. A record of questionable electioneering   There is already no doubt the Trump team was ready to go to extreme lengths in 2016 to win. In one of many staggering revelations about Russia in 2017, The New York Times reported that Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., wrote in an email \"I love it\" when told a senior Russian official had \"dirt\" to hand over on Clinton in a subsequent meeting in Trump Tower in New York. A more recent bombshell raised more doubts about the Trump camp's observance of electoral propriety. The President's former lawyer Michael Cohen admitted paying adult film actress Stormy Daniels a $130,000 hush payment in violation of campaign finance laws at the direction of the President. Then, when Cohen pleaded guilty to a charge lodged by Mueller in November, he said he had lied about the duration of a project to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. He originally said discussions ended in January 2016 but corrected that to say they continued as late as June 2016.  That left open the possibility that Trump had not only lied when he told Americans he had no business ties to Russia, but that he saw his campaign -- a form of public trust when he should have been promoting America's interests -- as a way to grease the wheels to a deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Another question that Mueller could clear up is why Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort offered proprietary polling data to Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime business associate with ties to Russia intelligence. The episode emerged from a botched campaign filing this month by Manafort's lawyers. It is not known whether the uber lobbyist was acting alone, possibly in an effort to funnel information to Ukrainian oligarchs to whom he was in debt. There was immediate speculation that Manafort was acting at the behest of other campaign operatives and the polling data might have helped the targeting of social media disinformation campaigns in key swing states by Russian intelligence. Mueller alleged in a separate indictment that a Kremlin-linked troll farm spent millions to influence Americans on social media, though the charges did not describe any coordination with Trump's team.   Trump often showed disdain for accepted standards of behavior in campaigns. For instance, the then-Republican nominee called on Russia to find 30,000 missing emails from the private server Hillary Clinton used while secretary of state. Later that day, according to a Mueller indictment, Russian intelligence operatives, spent hours trying to hack emails from a domain used by Clinton's private office. In August 2016, Trump was personally warned by senior US intelligence officials that foreign adversaries including Russia would likely attempt to infiltrate his team or gather intelligence about his campaign. In October, US intelligence agencies went public with findings that Russia had directed efforts by DCLeaks and WikiLeaks to release Democratic emails stolen by its spies. Yet the candidate Trump repeatedly praised WikiLeaks for the emails that badly damaged the Clinton campaign from the stump. \"I love WikiLeaks,\" he said at one point. The public warning from the intelligence agencies coincided with the release of an \"Access Hollywood\" tape that contained shocking audio of Trump making lewd comments about women. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks dumped a new batch of emails that appeared to have been designed to take the sting out of an October surprise that threatened to derail Trump's entire campaign. Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and conspiracy theorist, told CNN in November that Stone had called him several times that day to ask him to get in touch with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to get him to release more material. Stone denies this. Stone pleaded not guilty in court Tuesday to seven criminal charges of false statements, witness tampering and obstruction. He was not charged with conspiracy, though the indictment described how Stone allegedly coordinated with Trump campaign officials about his outreach to WikiLeaks. In one intriguing passage, Mueller alleged that \"after the July 22, 2016 release of stolen (Democratic National Committee) emails by (WikiLeaks), a senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact STONE about any additional releases and what other damaging information (WikiLeaks) had regarding the Clinton Campaign.\" The sentence sparked speculation about whether the person giving that direction, was Trump, or a member of his family. Even if it was Trump, it would not necessarily be a sign of a crime -- but could put him in jeopardy if he solicited information from WikiLeaks he knew was illegally obtained. Stone is a flashing warning sign   Even without clarity on whether the President directed Stone's activity, his presence close to Trump during the 2016 campaign is casting a suspicious light on the strategy the President pursued to win. Stone is a link between the Watergate storm, when he worked for President Richard Nixon's notorious dirty tricks gang, and the Russia intrigue -- potentially the biggest Washington scandal since the one that felled the 37th President. \"Stone will do anything to win,\" Princeton University history professor Julian Zelizer recently said on CNN. \"I think a lot of Republicans shudder to see him back in the news right now, literally flashing the Nixon signs and people are making that comparison between President Trump and President Nixon.\" If Mueller does not establish the activity during 2016 adds up to a criminal conspiracy, Congress will have to decide whether it needs to act in defense of the US electoral system. If it does, it wouldn't be the first time, and lawmakers may look to history for guidance. In an appendix to the final report of the Senate Select Committee on the Watergate scandal, which he chaired, North Carolina Sen. Sam Ervin defined that drama as an effort \"to destroy, insofar as the Presidential election of 1972 was concerned, the integrity of the process by which the President of the United States is nominated and elected.\" Should Congress decide Trump is guilty of a similar transgression, with or without a recommendation by Mueller, it must then work out whether it meets the standard of a high crime and misdemeanor, the standard for impeachment. A debate is likely at that point over whether wrongdoing before a President is elected requires the ultimate sanction against a commander in chief. After all, Nixon was already in office when the President's men set out to stain the integrity of the 1972 election. Corey Brettschneider, author of the recent book \"The Oath and the Office: a Guide to the Constitution for Future Presidents\" says that a candidate who undermines elections cannot be taken seriously when they later take an oath to defend the constitutional system. \"Certainly, cheating in an election or committing illegal acts to influence an election not only undermines a future president's integrity, it represents an existential threat to democracy, especially when it comes to colluding with a foreign government,\" Brettschneider said. \"If Trump cheated on the way to becoming president, he betrayed his oath to defend the basic law that underlies our system of self government,\" he said.","10":"Laura Beers is an associate professor of history at American University.

Hamilton's signal political achievement was his success in piloting his scheme for a national bank through a hostile Congress and then winning over opposition within George Washington's Cabinet. As Lin-Manuel Miranda's Hamilton laments to Washington, his opponents \"don't have a plan, they just hate mine!\" Faced with such intransigence, Miranda depicts Hamilton's transformation from a righteous defender of his own position into a master of the art of the compromise. Determined to stay in the game and come out with a win, he holds his nose, closes his eyes, and trades his support for moving the nation's capital south to the Potomac in exchange for James Madison and Thomas Jefferson's support for the new bank.  Unlike Prince Harry, who notoriously joined the cast on stage with his wife Meghan Markle after a charity production of Hamilton last summer and briefly broke into song, May apparently has not yet been to see the phenomenal production whose sell-out run helped give the West End its highest grossing year ever. In steering clear of Hamilton mania, May shares company with American President Donald Trump, who has declined to see the play since the New York cast was (to quote Trump's tweets) \"very rude\" to Vice President Mike Pence when he went to see the performance in 2016. At the time, the cast asked Pence to \"uphold our American values.\"   Yet both May and Trump could learn a lot from Hamilton's willingness to reach across the aisle and negotiate a grand settlement that transcended party divides. Since her Brexit deal was voted down by 432-202, May has made no real effort to listen to the concerns of the 304 members of the opposition who voted against the deal. Instead, she has focused her energies on trying to finesse the backstop and persuade the 128 Tory and Democratic Unionist Party defectors to get behind her plan.  Over the past week, the EU has shown no willingness to give ground on the issue of the backstop -- the provision in the Brexit deal agreed between May's government and Brussels which stipulates that, if a settlement cannot be reached that maintains the free movement of goods and people across the Irish border, the United Kingdom will remain in an indefinite customs union with the EU. Miraculously, as we go to press, May has just succeeded in bringing enough of the hard Brexiteers together behind her Plan B -- which is essentially Plan A, minus a decision to charge Europeans currently living in Britain to remain in the country and plus a promise to try her best to renegotiate on the backstop -- to eke out a narrow victory.  However, it is a triumph of Tory party unity, not a successful product of cross-party negotiation.     Faced with the prospect of his finance bill not passing, Miranda's Hamilton asked Washington, \"What happens if I don't get congressional approval?\" to which the President ruefully replies, \"I imagine they'll call for your removal.\"  May's success in both a party leadership vote and a parliamentary vote of no confidence means that she is not at imminent risk of removal, but she is facing a real risk of losing control of the Brexit negotiating process. If May wants to be the one who delivers a Brexit deal that the country can get behind, she needs to abandon her \"red lines\" and reach across the aisle and engage seriously with Labour politicians' demands for a softer Brexit that includes some form of customs union.  Trump could learn a similar lesson from Hamilton. In the United States, the government has finally reopened, after a shutdown lasting an unprecedented 35 days. Both Democratic and hard-right Republican pundits are suggesting that the President caved to pressure from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But Friday's decision to temporarily reopen the government is not a permanent solution to the funding crisis, and Trump has made it clear that he has not ruled out shutting the government down again if the Democrats have not agreed to fund his wall by February 15.  Trump, unlike May, presents himself as a master of the art of the compromise. In his own view, he was genuinely seeking to make a deal when he offered a three-year extension of protections for so-called Dreamers who entered the United States illegally as children, in exchange for reopening the government with a bill that includes funding for his wall. But a temporary extension of Dreamer status is not an offer to move the nation's capital 140 miles south from Philadelphia into plantation territory. It wasn't a sufficiently grand gesture to bring Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to the negotiating table. Trump's problem is that, what the Democrats view as too little compromise, his own right-wing sees as giving away too much.  May's and Trump's situations are different, as are their personalities as politicians, but what unites them both is their inability to put nation before party. While Hamilton could remain confident that the Federalists would ultimately stand behind his compromise, May's Tory Party is so plagued by division that a grand compromise that sidelined the hard Brexiteers would risk an irrevocable breach.  Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the polarization of American politics has made it politically dangerous for Trump to offer even minor quarter to the Democrats. As Republicans have pointed out, Democrats did vote to fund a border wall in 2013, but they did so as part of a broad package that would have also offered a path to citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants. Trump's base, which opposed even his offer of a three-year amnesty for Dreamers, would never support his offering a similar compromise today.  The company in Hamilton sing that they \"want our leaders to save the day,\" but saving the day would require a statesman, and May and Trump have proved that they are better at leading their party than leading the nation.  \"Winning was easy ... governing is harder.\"","11":" (CNN)Federal law enforcement officials raided top Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy's office last summer as part of a wide-ranging investigation into whether he illegally peddled his influence with the Trump administration on behalf of foreign officials, according to a sealed search warrant obtained by ProPublica. Federal authorities executed the search warrant at Broidy's Los Angeles office last summer, according to ProPublica, to seize records related to his dealings with dozens of individuals, foreign countries and companies.  News outlets reported last summer that Broidy was under federal investigation for his dealings with Chinese and Malaysian officials and his attempts to influence US policy relating to the two countries, but the sealed search warrant offers new details about the extent and seriousness of the probe. While the search warrant is reportedly from the summer and Broidy has not been charged, it's not clear if the investigation remains ongoing. Christopher Clark, an attorney for Broidy, did not respond to CNN's request for comment, but told The Washington Post in a statement last summer: \"Elliott Broidy has never agreed to work for, been retained by nor been compensated by any foreign government for any interaction with the United States Government, ever. Any implication to the contrary is a lie.\" Law enforcement officials sought to seize records related to Broidy's interactions with officials from both of those countries, as well as with Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. And they were also seeking records related to Rick Gates, the former Trump campaign official and deputy chairman of President Donald Trump's inaugural committee who pleaded guilty last year to federal charges in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Broidy, a top fundraiser for Trump's 2016 campaign, was named deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee in April 2017, only to resign a year later after payments he made to a former Playboy model in exchange for her silence about their affair became public. But before his resignation, the venture capitalist maintained close ties with top Trump administration officials and the President.","12":"Washington  (CNN)The possibility of getting a presidential pardon for Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former fixer who is going to jail after arranging hush money payments to protect Trump's presidential campaign, was discussed last year between Cohen's attorney and lawyers for the President, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. The Journal, citing conversations with people familiar with the discussions, reported that the talks occurred in April after the FBI raided Cohen's office, home and hotel room. The conversations, the paper said, took place between Stephen Ryan, Cohen's attorney at the time, and Jay Sekulow, Rudy Giuliani and Joanna Hendon, then the President's personal lawyers. Ryan also approached Alan Futerfas, an outside lawyer for the Trump Organization, and Alan Garten, the company's general counsel, according to the paper. Trump's lawyers \"dismissed the idea of a pardon at the time,\" but Giuliani, who still works as Trump's lawyer, \"left open the possibility\" of a future pardon for Cohen, the Journal reported. The Journal said the pardon discussions took place while Ryan was working with Trump's lawyers \"to review files seized from Mr. Cohen's premises by the FBI to determine whether they were protected by attorney-client privilege.\"  While testifying before the House Oversight Committee last week, Cohen, who is set to begin serving a three-year prison sentence in May, said he hadn't requested, nor would he accept, a pardon from Trump. The paper reported that during the discussions, Ryan \"left the impression that if Mr. Cohen couldn't rely on a pardon, he might cooperate\" with prosecutors in the Manhattan case.  The Journal said the discussions are now being looked into by the House Judiciary Committee as part of a sweeping investigation into Trump's campaign, businesses, transition and administration. CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said on \"New Day\" Tuesday that Ryan was \"doing (his) job\" by trying to get Cohen a pardon.  \"The President has shown through pardoning (Arizona sheriff) Joe Arpaio, through pardoning (conservative author and filmmaker) Dinesh D'Souza, that he uses the pardon power to help out his friends. So it is not surprising that they went out there trying to get a pardon. I don't think it was even inappropriate,\" Toobin told CNN's John Berman, adding that it's unclear whether or not Cohen knew about the discussions.  In August, Cohen pleaded guilty in a Manhattan US attorney's case to two campaign-finance violations tied to hush money payments he made or orchestrated to women during the campaign to stay silent about alleged sexual encounters with Trump, which the President has denied. Cohen has said he committed the crimes at Trump's direction.","13":"New York (CNN)Less than a month before he is set to testify in front of Congress, Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, has shaken up his legal team. Cohen, who has been subpoenaed to testify in mid-February by the Senate Intelligence Committee, will be represented by attorneys Michael Monico, a former federal prosecutor in the Northern District of Illinois, and his law partner, Barry Spevack, according to a statement from Cohen's legal consultant and spokesman, Lanny Davis. Since last summer, Cohen had been represented by Guy Petrillo, a criminal-defense attorney with strong ties to the Manhattan US Attorney's Office, where he had worked as the chief of the criminal division. That office investigated and charged Cohen with eight counts including tax fraud and campaign finance violations. Cohen, who was also subsequently charged with lying to Congress by special counsel Robert Mueller's office, pleaded guilty to all charges by both offices. He is scheduled to report to prison for a three-year sentence on March 6.  It was not clear exactly why Cohen replaced his legal team, but the relationship between Cohen and Petrillo had been unraveling for some time, according to a source with knowledge of the dynamic between the two men, and had devolved to a \"forced marriage.\"  Petrillo declined to comment Monday on the circumstances of his departure. Despite his upcoming incarceration, Cohen has fielded continued interest from Congress and a variety of prosecutors' offices for his testimony and other forms of assistance. Prior to being subpoenaed by the Senate committee, Cohen was scheduled to testify voluntarily before the House Oversight Committee next week. He said last week, however, that he would postpone that appearance, citing threats to his family from Trump and Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani. In his statement Monday, Davis said Cohen's newly installed legal team would handle his representation \"as he continues to cooperate\" with the special counsel, the Manhattan US Attorney's Office, the New York State Attorney General's Office and Congress. \"We look forward to helping Mr. Cohen fulfill what he has told us is his only mission -- to tell the truth as he knows it and to turn the corner on his past life and taking ownership for his past mistakes by cooperating as best as he can with all governmental authorities in search of the truth,\" Monico and Spevack said.  This story has been updated.","14":"New York (CNN Business)Legendary investor Bill Gross, the onetime king of the bond market, announced plans on Monday to retire after more than four decades in finance. Gross, 74, will step aside on March 1 to focus on managing his personal assets and charitable foundation, according to Janus Henderson (JHG), the firm he joined in 2014 after a messy divorce with PIMCO. Long a superstar in the investing world, Gross' investments have fallen on hard times in recent years. The funds he manages struggled and clients yanked their money. \"I've had a wonderful ride for over 40 years in my career,\" Gross said in a statement. \"I'm off -- leaving this port for another destination with high hopes, sunny skies and smooth seas!\" Gross co-founded PIMCO in 1971, turning the Newport Beach, California, firm into a powerhouse in the bond industry. Gross was named fixed income manager of the decade (2000 to 2009) by Morningstar. He enjoyed so much success that he became known as the \"bond king,\" a title that has since been bestowed upon DoubleLine Capital's Jeff Gundlach.  \"Bill spearheaded a series of transformational market innovations and frameworks that many investors still implement today,\" Mohamed El-Erian, a former top PIMCO exec who worked with Gross, told CNN Business' Paul R. La Monica on Monday.  Gross reportedly clashed with El-Erian at PIMCO, which by 2014 was gripped by turmoil. During a speech that year, Gross famously donned a pair of sunglasses to downplay media reports about the state of affairs at PIMCO. \"We're a happy kingdom at Newport Beach,\" Gross said at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago. Just three months later, Gross left PIMCO on bad terms. At the time, PIMCO was the world's largest bond firm, with nearly $2 trillion in assets.  Gross filed a lawsuit against PIMCO in 2015 that alleged a \"cabal\" of executives had wrongfully removed him in a conspiracy driven by a \"lust for power.\" Gross and PIMCO reached an $81 million settlement two years later.  \"He built a firm that stands today as among the very best, even in his absence,\" Morningstar research analysts wrote in a report on Monday. \"That said, his jarring departure from PIMCO and the nasty spat with his former firm were blemishes on his record.\"  After leaving PIMCO, Gross joined Janus Capital, now known as Janus Henderson. Gross's global unconstrained fund (JUCAX) initially enjoyed a surge of inflows. But the fund has stumbled in recent years and suffered from hefty client withdrawals.  The unconstrained fund ranked 88th in its category in 2018 and 76th the prior year, according to Morningstar.  Janus said that the fund has underperformed its three-month Libor benchmark since Gross joined in late 2014.  \"The four-year performance has been unsatisfactory no doubt,\" Gross told Bloomberg News on Monday. He noted that his fund's performance was still \"positive.\"  According to Janus, a separate total return fund managed by Gross outperformed its benchmark through the end of 2018. \"Bill is one of the greatest investors of all time and it has been my honor to work alongside him,\" said Dick Weil, CEO of Janus Henderson.  Janus said that effective February 15 it will rename Gross's global unconstrained bond fund the \"Absolute Return Income Opportunities.\" Gross isn't done managing money though.  He will continue to oversee $390 million held by the William, Jeff and Jennifer Gross Family Foundation. In addition to managing his personal fortune, Gross said he plans to work with his son and daughter to find worthy causes to support that are \"creating better lives locally and around the world.\"","15":"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)Many called Chike Ukaegbu's bluff when he announced he was running for the highest office in Nigeria at the age of 35.  The New York-based tech entrepreneur was entering a world largely dominated by older politicians with deep pockets. Popular wisdom suggested he stood no chance at the polls. A year ago, he would not have been able to put up his candidacy. Politics in Nigeria was closed to younger candidates up until the Not Too Young To Run bill -- championed by a youth movement -- succeeded last year in lowering the ages for elected offices. Ukaegbu is part of the new cohort of young aspirants taking advantage of the eligibility law to demand their seats at the table. Nigeria has recycled the same crop of older leaders for decades. President Muhammadu Buhari first ruled Nigeria in 1983 as a military head of state. He returned as a democratically elected president in 2015. The 76-year-old president is standing for re-election in February 16, and his main challenger is Atiku Abubakar, 72, Nigeria's former vice president, who has also been long in the corridors of power. \"What I am doing is not unprecedented in Nigeria. It was 31-year-old Yakubu Gowon that led the country out of a civil war,\" Ukaegbu said. \"The only problem is that our generation of millennials has not seen any young dynamic leader in Nigeria, and it's now an anomaly for us when we see a young person going into politics, and it should not be.\" The old guard Millennials make up more than 60% of Nigeria's 190 million people, yet older leaders preside over its affairs. The dominance of the old guard is deeply rooted in corruption, Leonard Raphael, Nigerian political commentator and research fellow at the University of Sussex, told CNN.  Only candidates with deep pockets and wealth amassed from the nation's resources have emerged victorious in past elections, Raphael said, shutting out younger aspirants and newcomers without a \"war chest\" to finance their campaigns. To rattle the older order, young contestants need to \"sell themselves to the populace\" and those building their political presence from scratch often do not have the resources. \"Electoral violence and rigging, vote buying and money politics have been the negative trend since 1999 and by previous leaders. The 'do or die' attitude to elections has been the bane of our politics and this has yet to change,\" Raphael said. The situation in Nigeria mirrors that in many other countries across the continent. Despite its young population, Africa has been under the grip of older leaders, widening the gap and disconnect between the leadership and the electorate. In the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is sparking hope for a new reform. At 42, Abiy is the youngest head of government in Africa and has since championed radical changes since he came into power in 2018.  His performance has triggered calls for youthful government across Africa, but older leaders remain elsewhere. Cameroon's 85-year-old president Paul Biya was elected for a seventh term last October, extending his 36-year rule in the country. More than 60 percent of Cameroonians were not born when Biya came into power 36 years ago.   More than 70% of Ugandans were not born when Yoweri Museveni took over power 32 years ago.  The 74-year-old president has held the country's politics in a vice-like grip, changing the constitution twice to extend his stay in office. He has been known to stifle newcomers wanting to get into the ring.  Ugandan pop star turned lawmaker, Bobi Wine, who challenged Museveni is currently facing treason charges. His legal battles aside, the 36-year-old MP's youth movement seeks to end Museveni's long-time rule when the country heads to the polls in 2021. \"We started a campaign calling upon all people of Uganda, especially the young people that have been so apathetic to go ahead and register themselves and be voters. \"By the time we get to the election... we will have many Ugandans registered as voters,\" Wine said. The grassroots advocate While Wine is going toe-to-toe with the Ugandan president, thousands of kilometers away, Nigerian actor and musician Bankole Wellington (or Banky W) is taking on politics \"one community at a time.\" He is going door to door in Eti-Osa, an affluent neighborhood in Lagos, mobilizing young people to vote for his new party. The 37-year-old says nothing will change if young people remain apathetic and abstain from the polls and politics. \"We have done a lot of talking, tweeting and complaining and that is where we have stopped. Not enough of us are doing something about it. We actually have to get into the system to fix it, and I am not just talking about from the presidential level,\" Wellington said.   \"It's like we are obsessed with who is running for president or governor, forgetting that the choice of our lawmakers can make the country better.\" Raphael agrees with Wellington, while young aspirants bring fresh perspectives that energize the electorate, they must build their way up the political ladder. \"The major parties in Nigeria have built deep political structures since 1999, and the current crop of young contestants, especially those vying in the presidential election are representing parties which do not have the required grass root to be a formidable force against the old guards,\" he said. \"They can start with junior positions in politics to build their experience and influence in society and hopefully will eventually get to the top.\" Newcomers vs old timers Activists and technocrats have joined the race for Nigeria's most powerful office, promising to disrupt the presidential race in 2019. Journalist Omoyele Sowore, 47, launched a campaign to \"take back the government\" from the grip of corruption, while Nigerian motivational speaker Fela Durotoye, 47 and former UN official, Kingsley Moghalu, 56, are running for president on the same promises.  None of these men are by definition youthful candidates, but they are newcomers and some decades younger than the frontrunners.  A coalition to pick a single presidential aspirant among these candidates last year descended into chaos, amplifying concerns that the emerging political class might not be different from their predecessors, given the same chance. Ukaegbu, who has focused his campaign on the three prongs of technology, education, and entrepreneurship, says only a young candidate can understand and tackle the frustrations of the Nigerian youth. \"I represent the largest block of the Nigerian population,\" he said. \"I understand the three key things that can transform the lives of millions of unemployed youth in the country. Now, we have old leaders ruling a digital population.\"","16":"Washington (CNN)During the 2016 presidential election, then-candidate Donald Trump was not granted a loan from Deutsche Bank following an extensive debate within the ranks of the bank, The New York Times reported on Saturday.  According to The Times' report, three people familiar with Trump's loan request said the decision ultimately came down to senior bank officials thinking that Trump's bombastic candidacy made the loan too high of a risk for the bank to take on. Two people familiar with the loan request told the paper that the Trump Organization's request was made in order to get financing for work on a golf property in Turnberry, Scotland, by borrowing against the organization's Miami property.  \"This story is absolutely false,\" Trump Organization spokeswoman, Amanda Miller told the New York Times.  \"We bought Trump Turnberry without any financing and put tens of millions of dollars of our own money into the renovation, which began in 2014. At no time was any money needed to finance the purchase or the refurbishment of Trump Turnberry.\" The New York Times also reported that Troy Gravitt, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, declined comment.","17":"Washington (CNN)Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie argued that the Southern District of New York -- and not the special counsel's Russia investigation -- presents more of a \"problem and a threat\" to President Donald Trump.  \"I always said that (special counsel) Bob Mueller is not what should concern the President or the White House. That's the Southern District of New York,\" Christie, who led Trump's transition team, told CNN's Chris Cuomo Thursday night.  Christie, a former federal prosecutor, argued that the SDNY has no limit on the scope of their investigation, unlike Mueller's investigation.  He also told CNN that Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen and Trump's deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates, who pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in Mueller's investigation, could serve as \"two tour guides that can take them through the Trump business and personal life.\" Christie pointed to Cohen's testimony before the House Oversight Committee Wednesday in which Cohen said he was in \"constant contact\" with the SDNY \"regarding ongoing investigations.\" Christie said he's confident that the SDNY is building a case to go after those around Trump who may have committed crimes and against Trump himself for when he leaves office.  \"Statute of limitations on most of this stuff, my guess is, would not run,\" Christie told Cuomo.  The former Republican governor added that he does not believe the SDNY has a case against the President \"at the moment.\" During his hearing Wednesday before the House Oversight committee, Cohen suggested the SDNY is examining a conversation he had with Trump in spring 2018, within two months of the FBI having executed search warrants on Cohen's home, hotel room and office. He was also asked whether he was aware of any other wrongdoing or illegal acts regarding Trump that hadn't been discussed yet. \"Yes, and again those are part of the investigation that's currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York,\" Cohen said.  CNN previously reported that federal prosecutors in New York were known to have been examining whether any Trump Organization executives violated campaign-finance laws as part of the scheme to reimburse Cohen for payments and had been conducting an investigation of the Trump inaugural committee.","18":"In this new weekly column \"Cross-exam,\" Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, gives his take on the latest legal news and answers questions from readers. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on \"CNN Newsroom\" at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. The cooperator responded from the witness stand, \"You got something to say to me?\" -- to which the boss screamed from the defense table, \"You're a punk!  You're a dog!  You're a dog!  You always were a dog your whole life, you punk dog!\"  The US Marshals had to restore order in the courtroom before we could finish the cooperator's testimony.       When Michael Cohen testified publicly in the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday, we did not see death threats or profane screaming matches. But the public did see the classic cooperator dynamic in play: One man swears to what the other vehemently denies, feelings of betrayal and mutual resentment boil to the surface and the stakes are at an all-time high.   After Cohen's testimony, many readers asked: As a former prosecutor, did you find his testimony credible?  I did.  Cohen, like all cooperating witnesses, is a flawed person and witness.  But the question is not whether a cooperator is likeable; it is whether they can be believed. And prosecutors assess believability by examining corroboration -- external, independent evidence that supports (or undermines) the cooperator's testimony.   Corroboration is king. A prosecutor rarely asks a jury simply to accept the word of a cooperating witness as gospel.  Rather, prosecutors test the cooperator's testimony against the independent evidence, and they know the jury will do the same. Much (but not all) of Cohen's testimony is backed up by independent, external evidence.  For example, Cohen produced a check for $35,000 signed by President Donald Trump in 2017 to reimburse Cohen for hush money payments to Stormy Daniels.  Cynics can call Cohen a liar all day long, but there's no cross-examining a signed check.   While Cohen does not have a smoking gun for every element of his testimony, think of the corroborating evidence as a series of solid posts that lend structural support to the overall fencing of his testimony.   Cohen also draws support from a particularly persuasive and credible source: the United States Department of Justice. In key respects, Cohen's testimony comports with factual assertions the DOJ has made in prior court filings. For example, Cohen testified that in July 2016 Trump learned from Roger Stone that WikiLeaks would publish stolen emails and encouraged Stone -- \"Wouldn't that be great\" -- to proceed.  In the Stone indictment, Mueller alleges that \"senior Trump Campaign officials\" contacted Stone about WikiLeaks and that one senior official \"was directed\" by an unnamed person to contact Stone about WikiLeaks' releases of emails. Cohen's testimony is entirely consistent with the allegations the DOJ makes in the Stone indictment.      If Wednesday's hearing had been a criminal trial, Cohen's testimony would have been the decisive moment in determining the President's fate on charges, including the same campaign finance violations to which Cohen himself has pleaded guilty. But ultimately -- given the current DOJ policy against indicting a sitting President -- Trump's fate will turn on politics. So the biggest remaining question is whether Cohen's testimony was both credible and persuasive enough to change the political calculus.      Now, your questions Robert, Arizona: Several pundits (yourself included) have indicated that Paul Manafort may face a long prison sentence. Given that potential reality, what are the chances that President Trump gives him a pardon?  Manafort is staring down the barrel of a devastating sentence -- two, in fact. First he faces a sentencing guidelines range of 235 to 293 months (just over 19 to 24 years) in the Eastern District of Virginia, where he was convicted by a federal jury on eight fraud counts. Manafort also faces up to a 10-year sentence in the District of Columbia, where he pleaded guilty to two additional felonies. So Manafort is down to one final hope: a presidential pardon. And his sentencing memo is a thinly veiled love letter to Trump. Dutifully parroting Trump's talking points, Manafort's defense team notes repeatedly in the memo that he was convicted of mere \"garden variety\" \"esoteric\" offenses, but not \"Russian collusion.\" I do not see Trump pardoning Manafort any time soon.  Because Manafort can no longer cooperate (having squandered the opportunity by lying to Mueller), Manafort can no longer hurt Trump, so Trump gains nothing by a pardon.  Additionally, Trump might incur a political cost by pardoning a convicted felon who has lied and cheated at every turn.  However, I do think a pardon is possible after Election Day 2020, whatever the outcome, when the political cost for Trump will likely be much lower.     Paul, California: How can Mueller's report be complete if he has not interviewed a key player in known campaign\/Russian communications: Donald Trump Jr.?  Mueller has not interviewed or subpoenaed Trump Jr., which raises questions about his status. I see two possible scenarios here. First, Mueller might believe Trump Jr. is neither a target -- somebody who is likely to be indicted -- nor a witness.  But given how central Trump Jr. was to the campaign and family business, it seems unlikely that he is not even a witness with information relevant to Mueller's investigation.   Second, Trump Jr. might be a target and, keeping with common prosecutorial practice, Mueller has not sought to interview him directly.  Roger Stone is an example; Mueller never interviewed Stone before indicting him. Given Cohen's testimony that he briefed Trump Jr. on the Trump Tower Moscow project approximately 10 times, coupled with Trump Jr.'s  prior testimony to Congress that he only had \"peripheral\" awareness of the project, Trump Jr. could face potential charges for perjury and false statements. There also could be a middle ground where Mueller has not conclusively determined Trump Jr.'s criminal exposure and intends to refer any continuing investigation to some other component of DOJ.   Speaking of which: Susan, Arizona: Is it possible that Mueller will hand off indictments or investigations to the SDNY if he doesn't complete them before he files his report? As Mueller reportedly finishes his work and prepares to send a report to the attorney general, this moment is more transition than finale. Many loose ends remain -- the sentencing of Manafort, Michael Flynn and Rick Gates; the trial of Stone; and a \"mystery\" subpoena battle, to name a few -- which will not cease to exist the moment Mueller packs up shop. And those are just open matters that we know about. Remember the golden rule: Mueller always knows more than we do.   Mueller already has referred portions of his investigation to the Southern District of New York (Cohen and other investigations), the District of Washington, DC (which is helping staff the Stone case) and other DOJ components. The SDNY in particular has expanded on its referrals from Mueller, with growing investigations of the Trump Organization and inaugural committee. Then, of course, there's the Mueller report, by which Mueller -- through the attorney general -- may transmit his findings to Congress for further action, ranging from hearings to potential impeachment.   Do not count on Mueller to walk away until he has ensured that his work can be completed, even in his eventual absence.  Ron, California: Two DOJ rules seem to conspire to put a sitting president above the law: 1) The DOJ policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted. 2) And that the DOJ must be silent about any subject under investigation against whom the evidence does not rise to the level of indictment.  Doesn't that derail a constitutional process for flushing out corruption from government? House Democratic leaders sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr anticipating this precise Catch-22: \"To maintain that a sitting president cannot be indicted, and then to withhold evidence of wrongdoing from Congress because the President will not be charged, is to convert [DOJ] policy into the means for a coverup.\"    While this result seems patently unjust, do not despair.  First, there is ample precedent for public disclosure of derogatory facts relating to uncharged individuals. In several cases of extraordinary public interest -- the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Ferguson Police Department investigation -- the DOJ made detailed public statements about subjects who were never charged with crimes.  Mueller's investigation is of similar or greater public importance. Second, House Democrats have made clear they will not accept a circular argument that places the President above the law. Their letter notes that because DOJ policy counsels against indicting a sitting president, \"Congress could be the only institution currently situated to act on evidence of the President's misconduct.\" Look for House Democrats to use every tool at their disposal, including the subpoena power, to prevent this loophole from insulating the President from accountability.  Mary Belle, Missouri: How much is this Mueller investigation costing the American taxpayer? According to the DOJ, the Mueller investigation cost approximately $25 million from its inception in May 2017 through September 2018. Assuming a roughly constant rate of spending, the investigation now has cost more than $30 million. While criminal investigations are not intended to be profit-making ventures, Mueller has more than recouped his own costs. The investigation has uncovered tax evasion totaling an estimated $48 million (which the government can recover through an arduous process of civil recovery), and Manafort alone has agreed to forfeit property worth more than $20 million.   Frank, Nebraska: If the declaration of a national emergency ends up before the Supreme Court, what will the court examine to determine the validity of the President's decision? For example, will it review the sources of information the President used to make that decision?  You've identified a key decision point for any court considering a legal challenge to Trump's national emergency declaration: How deeply will the court dig into the substantive merits of the emergency declaration? Courts typically steer clear of what they call \"political questions.\" The rationale is that courts should not substitute their policy judgments for that of elected policymakers. If the court sees the national emergency declaration as a political question, then a legal challenge will fail.  On the other hand, the court might decide that while it will defer generally to the President's determination, it still must evaluate the merits and ensure the President has not abused his authority.  In that case, even if the court gives some deference to the President, then I believe the facts -- including the Department of Homeland Security's data showing that illegal immigration is at or near historic lows, and a statement from a bipartisan group of 58 former senior national security officials that there is \"no factual basis\" for a national emergency -- will establish that the declaration is unfounded and should be struck down.  3 questions for next week:  1) How much time will Manafort get when he faces his first sentencing in federal court in Virginia? 2) Will Mueller send his report to the attorney general? 3) Now that we know Cohen continues to cooperate with the SDNY on ongoing investigations, what matters might the SDNY be probing?","19":" (CNN)This week the Trump administration learns what Democratic oversight looks like. After a 35-day government shutdown that consumed congressional leaders, Democrats hold a series of hearings this week that define a new normal in Washington: the Trump administration is in the hot seat. Empowered with their new majority and already facing roadblocks from key players in Trump's orbit, committee leaders are moving ahead with the spotlight on some of the President's most controversial policies and associates in a marathon not expected to end for the next two years. After Trump delivers his State of the Union this week -- an address intended to temporarily unite the country -- Democrats gavel in oversight hearings on the President's family separation policy along the southern border, probe the precedent of Presidential candidates releasing their tax returns and hear from Matt Whitaker -- the acting attorney general of the United States who has alarmed Democrats with his posture toward special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.  The week will end with a closed-door hearing in the House Intelligence Committee with the President's former lawyer and longtime fixer Michael Cohen and there are still questions about whether Cohen will also appear in an open setting before the House Oversight Committee. The long list of hearings is just a sampling of the scrutiny the Trump administration will face over the next two years, testing not just the President, but his Cabinet, policies and legacy. \"The Republican majority was willing to give the President the benefit of the doubt, and we are not going to be waiting for it work out. If kids are going to be taken from their parents at the border, we are going to be immediately investigating it,\" said Rep. Diana DeGette, the chair of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on investigations. \"It says we are not afraid to exercise our Article 1 prerogative of oversight of the executive branch.\" It's taken Democrats weeks to put their committees together, an always-lengthy process that was delayed slightly by the pressures of the government shutdown. But, chairmen are vowing not to let the drama of the spending crisis permanently keep them from their work. Already, Democrats have sent dozens of letters demanding documents from the administration. Last week, Democrats on the Oversight, Senate Finance Committee, Foreign Relations, Intelligence and Financial Services committees sent letters to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin seeking to know why the administration rolled back sanctions on three Russian firms tied to billionaire oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The House Oversight Committee formally launched an investigation into security clearance protocols at the White House. The Ways and Means Committee continues to be engaged in preparing to ask for the President's tax returns using an arcane IRS code, and some committees have begun summoning cabinet secretaries to appear before their committees for questioning. In some cases, those asks have fueled bitter public feuds and questions about whether secretaries are purposefully stonewalling the committees. The House Ways and Means Committee canceled a hearing it had planned to hold on the effects of the government shutdown after Mnuchin declined to appear in January. And, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declined to appear before an Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing on family separation although in a statement Health and Human Services said they had \"communicated in good faith\" with the congressional staff \"to provide the department's most knowledgeable subject matter experts to the subcommittee.\"  DeGette has told CNN she reserves the right to request Azar to appear again if she doesn't feel satisfied by answers at next week's hearing. The White House is also gearing up for the oversight and announced last week in an interview with CBS that Steven Groves, who previously worked as an assistant special counsel, would be the deputy press secretary devoted especially to coordinating press related to congressional investigations. New chairmen -- aware of the political risks of appearing too zealous in their new majority -- have taken care to impress upon their members that there is a fine line between getting answers and political showboating. But, with high-profile freshman and liberal members serving on key committees like Oversight and Financial Services, warnings and preparations may only go so far. \"I have been on the oversight subcommittee hearings for 20 years, and I have seen chairmen come and go. I have told (members) we are not going to badgering witnesses. We are not going to be unreasonable in our documents requests,\" DeGette said. \"It is not going to be gotcha.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also warned Friday in a KQED radio appearance that Democrats would be \"strategic\" in how they deploy subpoenas, \"but we will not be delinquent.\" So far, Democrats have cautiously avoided using their new subpoena power, but that restraint may soon be coming to an end. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, has said he won't hesitate to issue a subpoena to compel the Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen to testify before his committee. Thompson has accused Nielsen of stonewalling the committee after she declined to appear February 6, but Nielsen's staff has pushed back arguing they offered the chairman alternative dates for testimony. The push and pull between the new Democratic Congress and the administration is only expected to intensify as the President's circle seeks to shield Trump from around the clock scrutiny and Democrats continue to deliver rigorous pushback they say voters elected them to pursue. \"Hopefully we can get people in hearings and things to talk to them, but if there is a reluctance to talk to chairpersons and other things, I think those individuals don't leave you much choice,\" Thompson said on Capitol Hill last week. \"There are new chairpersons taking over. I would assume that you would want to hear that vision that those individuals have. I would assume you want to see how you can be helpful in pursuing their roles and responsibilities and you can only do that when you talk to people, and hopefully we will get that done.\"","20":" (CNN)A number of top donors to the Democratic Party have told 2020 candidates and campaigns that they are waiting for former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe to decide whether he will run for president before fully committing to other candidates. McAuliffe has deep ties to the Democratic donor community after years of raising money for Bill and Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and his two campaigns for governor of Virginia. He has publicly said he will decide whether to run for president in the next month, but as he waits, a number of prolific Democratic donors are sitting on the sidelines. The group includes Robert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television; longtime Democratic donor and former Ambassador to Portugal Elizabeth Frawley Bagley; and Chris Korge, a prolific donor to the Clintons and the co-chair of Miami Beach's 2020 convention efforts. \"I did give a contribution to Kamala Harris, but when I gave it to her, I told her, 'If McAuliffe jumps in, I am supporting him,'\" Korge told CNN. \"I have made it clear to her, as well as every other person who has approached me, including five or six of them running, that if McAuliffe runs, I am supporting him.\" Korge was echoed by John Morgan, the Florida-based attorney and donor who recently announced he was leaving the Democratic Party because he was disillusioned by the leftward shift of Democrats. Morgan has known McAuliffe since the early 1990s. \"I don't know who your close friends are, but it would be like one of your close friends ran for president and you were supporting Elizabeth Warren,\" Morgan said. \"It would be like, 'what the f***?'\" McAuliffe has long touted his expertise in raising money for Democratic causes and all of the donors CNN contacted said they had known the former Virginia governor for decades. But in the 2020 Democratic primary, connections to wealthy donors could be a negative for McAuliffe given how candidates like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are swearing off big donors and posh fundraisers. To some donors, that isn't a bad thing for McAuliffe. \"I think for Terry, depending on what Joe Biden does, may have a real path to say, 'I'm the capitalist in the room,'\" said Morgan. \"I think the best way to describe Terry is he is a compassionate capitalist.\" McAuliffe was the finance director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in his 20s and began raising money for presidential campaigns in 1980 with President Jimmy Carter's re-election effort. When he raised money for Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale in 1984, an article about him noted he could \"sell an icebox to an Eskimo or soda water to W. C. Fields.'' In 1988, McAuliffe was all in for Rep. Richard Gephardt and became one of his top fundraisers. \"You've only cost us the presidency,\" McAuliffe once told a donor who didn't want to give $5,000 to Gephardt. \"I hope you sleep easy tonight.'' It was around the 1992 presidential campaign, however, that McAuliffe made his most lasting political connection when he began raising money and advising Bill and Hillary Clinton. By the end of Clinton's two terms in the White House, McAuliffe boasted raising around $275 million for Clinton's campaigns, his second inaugural, the legal defense fund that protected him from being ousted from office, his presidential library and the former first lady's first Senate campaign. That relationship would deepen in the subsequent years. McAuliffe was elected chair of the DNC in 2001 and served until 2005. He was the chair of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign and worked on the board of directors of the Clinton Foundation. And McAuliffe himself would successfully run for governor of Virginia, with the Clinton's backing, in 2013 after a failed run in 2009. This lengthy history in Democratic politics has endeared the former governor to a number of top Democratic donors, earning McAuliffe as arguably one of the best Democratic fundraisers of his generation. \"I am comfortable holding off and not making any significant commitment until he decides,\" said Al Dwoskin, a top Democratic donor who started working with McAuliffe in the 1980s. \"I would say it is highly likely he will run.\" One reason, said Dwoskin, is the fact that McAuliffe knows he will have the resources to get his message out. \"There is a big difference between having the resources to have a campaign and having an effective campaign. It is hard to have one without the resources,\" Dwoskin said of McAuliffe. \"That's a big part of it.\" Elizabeth Frawley Bagley, a longtime Clinton donor, also told CNN she was holding off donating to candidates who have asked for support. \"I support what they are doing, some of them called me before they were running and asked what I thought,\" said Bagley. \"But at this point, I am holding off and waiting Terry.\" McAuliffe has told Bagely and others that he will decide on running by the end of March, something he has also told a handful of reporters. One question that these donors have, though, is what the former Virginia governor will do if former Vice President Joe Biden, a candidate that many believe could make a McAuliffe run less successful, decides to run for office. A source close to McAuliffe tells CNN that Biden, more than other possible contenders, directly impacts the former Virginia governor's decision to run, but adds that McAuliffe would still consider running if Biden is in. \"It is a factor in his thought process,\" the source said. \"They would likely be speaking to the same voters and Biden would impact his chances.\" The source added: \"It would certainly not rule it out, but it is a factor in his thinking.\" McAuliffe has expressed the same to donors, said the Democrats CNN spoke to. \"I think if Biden doesn't run,\" said Korge, \"he should run.\" \"I really think that if Joe Biden does not run... Terry runs as fast as he can to Des Moines, Iowa,\" said Morgan. \"And Des Moines, Iowa will see the greatest retail politician they have ever seen since Bill Clinton.\"","21":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN)On Tuesday, former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak will appear in court -- facing years in prison if convicted on corruption charges which seemed impossible less than a year ago.  The son and nephew of former prime ministers, scion of the Malay elite and head of the all-powerful United Malays National Organization (UMNO), which has dominated Malaysian politics since the country's independence, Najib's downfall is as staggering as the scale of the corruption he has been accused of.  Even after the scandal over 1MDB -- the sovereign wealth fund Najib set up and allegedly helped embezzle billions of dollars from -- erupted worldwide, the idea of Malaysia prosecuting its former leader still seemed like fantasy. Najib was the \"Teflon prime minister,\" and almost all observers expected him to weather the storm.  Political son Najib grew up surrounded by privilege and power. The son of Prime Minister Abdul Razak Hussein, he attended the elite Malvern College in the UK from the ages of 15 to 18 before going on to study economics at the University of Nottingham, an education which reportedly left him with a pronounced British accent some observers felt could hold him back in politics.  After a brief stint as an executive at the state-run oil company Petronas, Najib entered politics at just 23, taking over the Pekan parliamentary seat occupied by his father after the older man's death in 1976. He quickly rose through the ranks of UMNO, the largest party in the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition set up by Abdul. Between 1976 and 1999, Najib held finance, culture, education and defense portfolios, overseeing in the latter role a significant investment in and modernization of Malaysia's armed forces.  Najib proved an adept electoral operator, winning majorities of 23,000 and 26,000 in 2004 and 2008 respectively -- among the highest margins in Malaysian history. In 2009, he succeeded Abdullah Ahmad Badawi as both UMNO leader and prime minister. While UMNO had previously succeeded in appealing to ethnic Malays, at the expense of Chinese and Indian voters, Najib emphasized a \"multiracial, multi-religious\" nation under the banner of 1Malaysia. A key part of this approach was the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) sovereign wealth fund, which Najib and others said would be instrumental in \"propelling Malaysia towards becoming a developed nation.\"  However, according to prosecutors in Malaysia, the US and Singapore, 1MDB became a slush fund for executives including Najib, who allegedly used it to pay for his and his wife's increasingly extravagant lifestyles as well as for vote-grabbing projects in parts of the country where UMNO support was flagging.  Scoops and scandal In early 2015, journalists from the Sarawak Report and Wall Street Journal began reporting that millions of dollars had been siphoned off the fund after allegedly securing a series of leaked documents.  At first it seemed like the scandal might spell the end of Najib, as opponents -- and even some within his party -- demanded an investigation and called for him to resign.  Behind the scenes, there were efforts to smother the scandal. Xavier Justo, a former employee of the 1MDB-linked PetroSaudi, who allegedly attempted to blackmail that company with stolen documents before leaking them to journalists, was arrested in Thailand. Facing years in a Thai jail, Justo was allegedly pressured to claim the Sarawak Report and The Edge, a Malaysian newspaper which had been leading the story domestically, of fabricating and doctoring the leaked documents.  Even as Najib denied any wrongdoing, the cascade of negative stories continued, and in July of that year he took to Facebook to defend himself.  \"Let me be very clear: I have never taken funds for personal gain as alleged by my political opponents -- whether from 1MDB, SRC International or other entities, as these companies have confirmed,\" he wrote. \"It is now clear that false allegations such as these are part of a concerted campaign of political sabotage to topple a democratically elected Prime Minister.\"  Clare Rewcastle-Brown, of the Sarawak Report, said Malaysia had struggled for decades with corruption and entrenched privilege -- but it allegedly all \"got out of control under Najib.\" \"It had been kind of contained under the strong rule of his predecessors,\" she said. Autocratic turn In mid-2015, Attorney General Abdul Gani Patail informed police that investigators had enough information to prepare a charge sheet against Najib.  Yet Abdul Gani was later removed from his position for \"health reasons\" and replaced by a Najib ally who would later clear the Prime Minister of wrongdoing. Senior police and government officials involved in the investigation or critical of Najib were also replaced.  After Rewcastle-Brown secured the charge sheet and published it, Malaysia issued a warrant for her arrest. The reporter was accused of committing an act \"detrimental to parliamentary democracy.\" \"They thought that when I came out with the story originally at the start of 2015 that they could contain it,\" Rewcastle-Brown said. \"They created me into this sort of monstrous machine of forged documents and all the rest.\"  While she was safe in the UK, journalists in Malaysia were more vulnerable. The Edge publisher Ho Kay Tat had already been arrested on sedition charges, and now the authorities moved to suspend the newspaper's publication license altogether.  To clamp down on anti-government demonstrators, yellow clothing with the slogan \"Bersih\" -- the word meaning \"clean\" used as the name for the protests -- was banned.  Yet while he might have been able to contain anger on the streets, Najib had underestimated the frustrations bubbling up within the Malaysian state.  According to Tom Wright and Bradley Hope, who reported on the case for the Wall Street Journal and wrote the book \"Billion Dollar Whale: The Man Who Fooled Wall Street, Hollywood, and the World,\" some officials feared Najib would shrug off the scandal.  \"At the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, which had recommended the prime minister's arrest, there was simmering anger over the mothballing of their investigation,\" Wright and Hope wrote. \"And so, a handful of investigators began to secretly feed information to the FBI.\" In July 2016, the US Justice Department stunned Malaysia by filing a suit to recover more than $1 billion in assets it said had been embezzled from 1MDB.   This was the \"point of real no return (for Najib), although he probably didn't see it,\" Rewcastle-Brown said.  As prosecutors in the US chased assets and witnesses, 1MDB began to collapse under the weight of its massive borrowing. While Najib tried to win back favor following Donald Trump's election, meeting the American leader in Washington in late 2017, it did not stop the Justice Department's pursuit of him.  Najib, who had long courted Washington as a key ally, now turned to China. Chinese companies reportedly agreed to help bail out 1MDB, giving it a temporary reprieve, though some of the deals later fell through.  Election shock Despite the negative headlines, lawsuits and alleged corruption, few counted Najib out as Malaysia entered the 2018 election. The country's opposition had never won an election. Its most dynamic politician, Anwar Ibrahim, was in jail on charges of sodomy, and while the various parties had formed a coalition led by former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, he was 92 -- and with a dubious history of his own.  The Malaysian electoral map was also heavily skewed in Najib's favor, with some estimates saying his Barisan Nasional coalition could win a parliamentary majority with less than 20% of the popular vote.  Further, the government introduced a new law claiming to crack down on \"fake news\" which critics said was an attempt to criminalize criticism of Najib. Weeks before the poll, Mahathir's party was dissolved for allegedly missing paperwork and he faced charges under the new \"fake news\" law. \"Malaysia was on the brink of utter catastrophe,\" Rewcastle-Brown said. \"He was running the economy into the ground and China's hands, turning the place into a dictatorship. If he'd won that election it would have been the validation he was looking for.\"  But she added that while \"no one thought that this powerful grip he had on the country could be relinquished (the 2018 election) was the only chance Malaysians had.\" More than 76% of the 14.3 million eligible voters in the country turned out, with Mahathir's opposition coalition taking 121 of 222 seats. Najib's Barisan Nasional won just 79.  \"We did not anticipate that the wave of change was ... so convincing. That (Najib) had to acknowledge it and quit,\" Anwar told CNN months after the election.  Downfall Within days of the stunning election loss, Najib and his wife were barred from leaving the country. Police soon raided their properties and seized millions of dollars in luxury goods allegedly linked to the 1MDB funds.  In July 2018 -- three years after the first 1MDB stories began emerging -- Najib was charged with four counts of corruption. The charge sheet was later expanded to cover dozens of other alleged crimes. His wife, Rosmah Mansour, whose profligate spending with funds allegedly embezzled from 1MDB had helped fuel public outrage, was arrested months later.  And this week, as Najib faces his accusers, many Malaysians hope the country will finally shed its old reputation and transform into an open democracy governed by the rule of law.  \"I think the key people who are responsible must be held accountable,\" Anwar said. \"You must either accept this new regime of transparency and good governance, or you get out.\"","22":"Budapest, Hungary (CNN)Flick through a Hungarian history book for high school students, and you're left in no doubt about the government's view on migrants. The section on \"Multiculturalism\" opens with a photo of refugees camped under a Budapest railway station. Flanking the image is a speech given by strongman Prime Minister Viktor Orban on the perils of migration: \"We consider it a value that Hungary is a homogenous country,\" he says. The state-sanctioned textbooks are part of a government shakeup of Hungary's education system that is causing deep unease among some teachers and publishers. Critics say the textbooks are just one front in a government crusade to remake the education system -- and the country -- in its Christian, nationalist image. Orban has also scrapped academic programs that don't fit with his conservative values, effectively forcing one of Hungary's leading universities to move its courses abroad.   Education 'straight from the state' The shake-up comes amid weeks of street protests against Orban's hardline policies, signaling cracks in his grip on the central eastern European nation. Since Orban's populist Fidesz Party swept into power in 2010, and most recently won a landslide victory again in April last year, it has been at the helm of a \"major educational reform,\" government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told CNN when it visited Hungary late last year. Previously, local municipalities oversaw the country's public schools. But in recent years the state has taken over responsibility -- and that includes supplying textbooks, said Kovacs of the measure to tackle funding \"insufficiencies.\" He said that \"finally, after almost 20 years of struggle of how to finance and run the education system, we have taken responsibility.\" The government hoped to introduce a new curriculum by fall this year, Kovacs added. School books are created in the state-run Education Research and Development Center (OFI) by various contributing experts, explained Ildiko Rep\u00e1rszky, a history teacher and author of some of the earlier versions. These days, the books don't bear the name of a single author on the cover. Instead, a board of editors reportedly handles the texts from contributors \"completely freely, as raw material, reshaping them at will,\" said Rep\u00e1rszky.  The reforms come as the country's Central European University -- founded by billionaire philanthropist and well-known Orban foe George Soros -- announced last month it had been \"forced out\" of Hungary by a hostile government and was moving its US-accredited courses to the Austrian capital Vienna. The internationally renowned university called it a \"dark day\" for Hungary and Europe -- something the government dismissed as \"nothing more than a Soros-style political bluff.\" But some educators in Hungary told CNN that Orban's hardline policies were already having a deep impact on the nation's children, long before they entered university. 'This is just everyday politics' In his small office in central Budapest, chairman of Hungary's Association of History Teachers, Laszlo Miklosi, opens a history book for 14 and 15-year-olds covered in Post-it notes. He turns to the page on multiculturalism and points to a speech Orban gave to the European Parliament in Strasbourg in May 2015 that laid out Hungary's position on migrants.   In the speech, the Prime Minister said Hungarians considered it a value that their country was homogenous in terms of its \"culture,\" \"traits\" and \"way of thinking.\" \"This is just everyday politics,\" said Miklosi, adding \"It doesn't say anything about the actual reasons for existing problems of migration -- instead it's what the current prime minister thinks about it.\" Orban's defiant relationship with the European Union also plays out in a cartoon showing Germany as a giant sow feeding piglets representing Greece, Spain, Belgium and Portugal. Standing apart from the rest and happily munching its own grass, is the Hungary piglet. In the same geography book under the chapter on \"Population Decline and Migration,\" another cartoon shows a Hungarian boy and girl with the caption: \"The number of those who think Hungary is the best place to live has significantly increased.\" The illustration includes statistics like \"67% of young people can only imagine their future in this country.\" And \"every 4th young person lives in a marriage or a permanent relationship and 68% of those who don't, would like to,\" with no clear source for the findings. The image \"enlarges the patriotic feelings of young people in Hungary, their contentedness with their country, their willingness to get married and start a family -- while also downplaying their willingness to move abroad,\" said Rep\u00e1rszky, who is also part of the Association of History Teachers, which has around 400 members. Government spokesman Kovacs dismissed the teachers' concerns as a \"political opinion,\" adding that the government always welcomed \"criticism, contribution, observations and comments\" from \"professional organizations.\" 'Migrant' and 'Soros' are schoolyard taunts Miklosi, who has reviewed school textbooks for more than 30 years, believes Orban's anti-migrant rhetoric has filtered down to classrooms and playgrounds. \"'Migrant' has become a swear word for many people, including many children,\" he said. Should a teacher say the words \"Jewish\" or \"gypsy\" or \"Slovak\" they are often met with students \"giggling and nudging each other\" and the teacher has to \"actively fight for space to discuss these categories in a neutral way,\" Miklosi added. It's a view shared by English teacher Juli Karolyi, who said for some students the words \"migrant\" and \"Soros\" had become \"swear words used in schoolyards and playground conflicts.\" But she added that children's views were \"mostly decided in the home\" rather than in the pages of textbooks. \"If the parents fall for the government propaganda, the kids will follow suit -- especially the younger ones,\" she said. A few blocks from Miklosi's inner-city office, 18-year-old student Akos Blaskovics has just finished a morning history class at his high school, Fazekas Mih\u00e1ly Gimn\u00e1zium. The quietly-spoken teenager told CNN that he \"hasn't really seen a difference in the messages of textbooks in recent years.\"  But he did think the government has tried to \"make people focus on the question of migrants,\" rather than \"more important things like education, healthcare and social problems.\" Five textbook publishers, 123 trials  In a small village 30 minutes' drive east of Budapest, publisher Andr\u00e1s Romankovics' home office is packed with bookshelf after bookshelf of rainbow-colored spines arranged by decade. The former teacher and his wife started publishing school textbooks in 1978, and he estimates around 10 million copies have been printed over the years. Hungarian school textbook licenses must be renewed every five years. Romankovics is one of five independent textbook publishers who are suing the government after it rejected their requests to extend their licenses, which were due to expire at the end of 2018. The court case relates to 123 books in total -- meaning 123 separate trials for each book. Needless to say it's a lengthy process, and since the trials began in September, around 20 books have been granted permission to extend their licenses, said Romankovics. Meanwhile the licenses of state-sponsored textbooks were extended, he said. Kovacs, the government spokesman, would not comment on why the government had rejected the independent textbook publishers' license requests, saying only that it was an \"ongoing case\" and \"going through a higher level of decision-making.\" But Romankovics, who is also chair of the National Textbook Association, which represents 20 publishers, warned that without a true diversity of books, children's education would suffer. 'There is a deeper problem here'  While independent publishers battle to keep their textbooks in schools, university professors are battling to keep their programs in Hungary. Inside the grand, high-ceilinged offices of Budapest's CEU, gender studies associate professor Eva Fodor is dismayed that the government has scrapped her program which has been running for over 20 years. The university offers US- and Hungarian-accredited gender studies degrees -- or at least it did, until the government struck gender studies from its list of accredited programs in October.  While the US-accredited program will continue in Vienna, the Hungarian-accredited degree no longer exists, affecting around 45 MA students enrolling each year, said Fodor. The only other Hungarian university to offer gender studies -- E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd (ELTE) -- was also forced to scrap its program. \"It's a clear and unprecedented violation of academic freedom,\" said Fodor, adding that it wasn't just gender studies that didn't fit with Orban's world view. \"It indicates that there is a deeper problem here,\" she said. Orban wants to create a strong ideology that people can hold on to, based on \"national pride and his idea of very simple Christian values,\" Fodor said. \"And (he's) eliminating everyone else who is not willing to subscribe to this ideology,\" she added. According to Kovacs, gender studies degrees were scrapped because of low enrollment, scarce job opportunities, and the government's \"philosophical approach.\" \"We believe there are only two sexes -- men and women,\" he said. Kovacs added that students were still free to research gender issues from the perspective of other disciplines, such as philosophy or sociology. \"But we don't believe that gender is an independent discipline in itself.\" Students who see it otherwise had better look for classrooms outside Hungary.","23":" (CNN)The phone rang shortly before Christmas in 2014. When Maya Fischer answered, a nurse from the nursing home where her mother had been staying for more than a decade was on the other end of the line. In her Minnesota home, Fischer braced herself for difficult news.  \"When you receive a phone call from the nursing home, your first thought is that ... my mother has passed,\" Fischer said. The news was indeed troubling, but it was not what she expected. \"I was not at all prepared for the call that I received. ... The call that my mother had been a victim of a sexual assault in her nursing home,\" Fischer said. \"For me and my family, it's been devastating.\" Fischer testified in front of lawmakers in the nation's capital on Wednesday. The US Senate Committee on Finance held a hearing to discuss reports of abuse and neglect in some nursing homes nationwide and what can be done to protect those of all ages at risk of abuse. \"My final memories of my mother's life now include watching her bang uncontrollably on her private parts for days after the rape, with tears rolling down her eyes, apparently trying to tell me what had been done to her but unable to speak due to her disease,\" Fischer said in the hearing, referring to her mother's Alzheimer's disease. Along with Fischer, Iowa resident Patricia Blank testified about how she is the daughter of a nursing home neglect victim, Virginia Olthoff. In a news release on Tuesday, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley's office noted how the nursing home where Blank's mother resided and died \"received the highest possible ranking from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for quality of resident care, though it had been fined for physical and verbal abuse a year before Olthoff's death.\" \"How a place with the highest possible rating could yield such a tragic incident is just outrageous,\" he said in the news release. \"Things need to change, both for the standards at care facilities and for how CMS rates them. When American families consider where their loved ones can get the care they need, they should be able to rely on CMS information. That's clearly not the case right now.\" After the hearing, Grassley said in a statement that Fischer's and Blank's stories were \"troubling.\" \"Today I heard troubling accounts, which lead me to believe continued oversight is needed in this area. There are two government watchdog agencies currently working on reports for Congress. One is the Inspector General of Health and Human Services and the other is the Government Accountability Office. I plan to convene another hearing on this topic after these agencies release their reports. I also intend to submit follow-up questions to each of the witnesses as we work toward reforms,\" he said. On Tuesday, CMS announced that updates will be made next month to the online tools for consumers to research nursing home quality: the Nursing Home Compare database, which allows users to compare nursing homes, and the Five-Star Quality Rating System, which rates nursing homes based on inspections, staffing and quality measures.  CMS also issued new guidance Tuesday that \"clarifies what information is needed to identify immediate jeopardy cases across all healthcare provider types, which we believe will result in quickly identifying and ultimately preventing these situations,\" such as abuse or neglect cases. \"Every nursing home serving Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries is required to keep its residents safe and provide high quality care. We have focused on strengthening requirements for nursing homes, working with states to enforce statutory and regulatory requirements, increasing transparency of nursing home performance, and promoting improved health outcomes for nursing home residents,\" Dr. Kate Goodrich, director of the Center for Clinical Standards and Quality at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a statement Tuesday. At Wednesday's hearing, lawmakers pressed Goodrich on what has been done and what more could be done to ensure quality at facilities. There were several factors mentioned about why a nursing home might fall behind certain quality standards, including being unable to retain qualified staff and conduct comprehensive background checks on staff.  \"We do have expectations for nursing facilities for having the appropriate staffing for their patient population, and we survey for that on a regular basis,\" Goodrich said in the hearing. At the hearing, New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez said in response, \"I think there's a gulf between the expectations and the reality in several of these instances and we look forward to working with you to bridge the gulf.\" 'The most vulnerable people in our society' Wednesday's hearing came just weeks after a sexual assault case at an Arizona health care facility involving a 29-year-old woman who has been in a vegetative state for years and gave birth in December. She has been a patient at the facility since 1992, according to court records. In January, a 36-year-old nurse was arrested on suspicion of impregnating the woman. Among nursing homes, an exclusive CNN investigation in 2017 found that the federal government has cited more than 1,000 for mishandling or failing to prevent alleged cases of sex abuse, including rape and assault, at their facilities between 2013 and 2016 -- before revisions were made in November 2016 relating to how CMS surveys and inspects long-term care facilities. Fischer's mother's case was one of several in CNN's 2017 investigation. Her mother has since died. \"My goal by attending the hearing is simply to be my mom's voice and to put a face with her name. I don't want her to go down as being just another horrible statistic,\" Fischer said. \"Stronger legislation needs to be enacted to protect the elderly. These are some of the most vulnerable people in our society, and I don't think that we're doing enough to ensure their safety.\" Anyone -- a nurse, family member or resident -- can report nursing home abuse or neglect to CMS through state groups or a state's long-term care ombudsman program, whose information is provided on the Medicare website. State health investigators examine all types of abuse reported at nursing homes and assisted living facilities. In the case of nursing homes, state officials typically conduct these investigations on behalf of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which regulates the more than 15,000 facilities that receive government reimbursements that pay for many residents' care.  Additionally, states conduct standard survey inspections of nursing homes that are unannounced and can come at any time. Both state health agencies and the federal government use the information from routine surveys to rate facilities. If abuse or neglect is found in a nursing home, penalties are enforced, ranging from monetary penalties to termination from the Medicare and Medicaid program.  A database of nursing home penalties in the United States can be found on the Medicare website, and there is a national registry of Medicare-funded nursing homes where you can find out how the facility ranks and whether it has any recent citations. The American Health Care Association represents nursing centers, assisted living communities and centers and homes for individuals with disabilities.  Dr. David Gifford, senior vice president of quality and regulatory affairs at the association, who testified at the hearing, said in a statement after the hearing that the group \"remains committed to reducing any future cases of abuse and neglect.\"  \"AHCA stands ready to work with Congress, members of the Senate Finance Committee, CMS, and other providers to keep residents safe and continue improving the quality of care provided. There are robust regulatory requirements and penalties already in place to ensure patients are protected and corrective measures are implemented after a case of abuse or neglect occurs. But we can -- and must -- do more,\" Gifford said in the statement. \"We should expand federal programs that attract health care workers to the nursing home profession. We should strengthen federal regulations around reporting and sharing of information about employees who have engaged in abuse through the creation of a national background check registry. And we should make resident and family satisfaction ratings of nursing homes publicly available.\"   This isn't the first time lawmakers looked into nursing home safety. In September, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a subcommittee hearing on \"examining federal efforts to ensure quality of care and resident safety in nursing homes.\" In a response at that time, Mark Parkinson, president and CEO of the American Health Care Association, said in a statement that long-term care providers have made improvements in quality of care, such as by reducing rehospitalization rates and increasing staffing.  \"Instead of praise for this progress, we have been subjected to additional scrutiny and criticism,\" Parkinson said. \"The reality is that nursing homes are a convenient political punching bag. Over the years, Congress has turned to us to pay for everything from student loan debt relief to Medicare physician payments,\" he said. \"At a time when Congress faces public criticism for its failure to work together and accomplish shared goals, this hearing seems like a misguided effort to find more ways to regulate an already overburdened sector. Long term care is one of the most regulated industries in the country, yet we've shown some of the most dramatic improvement on both self-reported and government quality measures.\" 'I find it hard to believe that the time he was caught was the first time' George Kpingbah, the 76-year-old nursing assistant accused of assaulting Fischer's mother, Sonja Fischer, had a history of sexual assault allegations. Personnel records obtained by prosecutors during the investigation into Sonja Fischer's case and reviewed by CNN showed that Kpingbah was suspended three times as officials at Walker Methodist Health Center in Minneapolis investigated accusations of sexual abuse at the facility, including at least two in which he was the main suspect. The earliest complaint was in 2008, when police investigated allegations that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with a 65-year-old with multiple sclerosis. In another case, an 83-year-old blind and deaf woman who lived on the same wing as Maya Fischer's mother said she was raped multiple times -- always at midnight.  Police investigated her report just seven months before Fischer's mother was assaulted. Though the woman could not identify her assailant, Kpingbah was suspended, along with several other male staffers who were on duty during the nights of the alleged assaults. None of these allegations was found to be substantiated by the facility or the state. For years, Walker Methodist kept Kpingbah on the overnight shift -- until one early morning in December 2014, when someone caught him in the act. It was 4:30 a.m. December 18, 2014, when a fellow caregiver saw Kpingbah in 83-year-old Sonja Fischer's room at Walker Methodist. The witness noticed the aide thrusting back and forth, which is when she said she knew that a sexual assault was occurring.  Kpingbah ultimately pleaded guilty to third-degree criminal sexual conduct with a mentally impaired or helpless victim and was sentenced to eight years in prison. In a court statement in 2015, Maya Fischer said that her mother, who had Alzheimer's disease, was \"unable to speak\" and \"unable to fight back\" against her assailant. Fischer detailed her mother's story, recounting how she had fled Indonesia with her family to escape the rape and killing of young girls by Japanese soldiers, only to fall victim decades later to a man whose job was to care for her. \"I find it hard to believe that the time he was caught was the first time he assaulted her, and that will always haunt me,\" Fischer said Monday. Abuse cases typically get reported to state departments of health, and Fischer hopes nursing homes and state agencies will be more transparent when there are future cases of abuse. \"The Department of Health needs to take these accusations and investigations more seriously,\" she said. \"It's my understanding that Mr. Kpingbah was a suspect in prior investigations before he was caught raping my mother, and my mother lived there for 12 years.\" Regarding Sonja Fischer's case, the Minnesota Department of Health found that the facility acted immediately to ensure the resident's safety and promptly removed Kpingbah. The state also noted that the facility had provided Kpingbah with required abuse training. As a result, the facility was not cited for any wrongdoing; only Kpingbah was held accountable for the assault. Maya Fischer had no way of knowing about the previous allegations against Kpingbah uncovered by CNN. But she sued Kpingbah, who agreed to an unusual arrangement in which, as of 2017, he is on the hook for a $15 million judgment only if he abuses again. Walker Methodist refused to comment on the previous allegations against Kpingbah, who worked at the facility for nearly eight years, but said in a statement that it fully cooperated with authorities and that \"the care and well-being of all of our residents and patients is our primary focus.\" Mark Kosieradzki, a Minnesota attorney who has represented a number of victims and their families, including the Fischer family, said he has seen the number of nursing home abuse cases rise within his own practice.  \"The number of calls we get are increasing. The severity of some of the problems we're seeing is increasing. Whether more people are calling because there's a greater awareness in the community or whether there's more problems, I guess it would be nice if we had information from [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] about that, but the fact of the matter is, we'll get six to eight calls a day in our law firm,\" Kosieradzki said.  \"Certainly, there's good nursing homes out there, but there's also nursing homes that are focused on their profits as opposed to the care they're giving, and that's what we try to focus on to change,\" he said.  Although laws require abuses to be reported and investigated, these laws may not always be followed by some nursing homes. Then there are concerns that if an incident gets reported, some experts say, investigations should be conducted more aggressively. Many nursing home employees promptly report abusers to authorities, as required by federal law, and assist in the investigations, but in numerous examples of abuse uncovered by CNN in 2017, some facilities made it possible for violent rapes and sexual assaults to go unchecked. In those facilities, allegations were routinely questioned or dismissed because victims had cognitive conditions such as Alzheimer's. Workers often lacked the specific training needed to spot sexual abuse, keeping reports of abuse from ever reaching authorities, and the reputation and safety of the facility may have taken priority if there was fear that bringing investigators into a cash-strapped facility could expose other issues or threaten a nursing home with closure or costly lawsuits. As for Wednesday's hearing, Kosieradzki said he hopes for more awareness about various types of abuse: sexual abuse, overmedicating with opioids and neglect. \"I'm looking for the CMS and the [state] Department of Health to start looking at these consumers and these patients to help them.\" Despite the litany of abuses detailed in government reports, there is no comprehensive national data on how many cases of sexual abuse have been reported in facilities housing the elderly. In CNN's 2017 analysis, the health departments and other agencies that oversee long-term care facilities in all 50 states were surveyed. Of the states that could provide at least some data, the responses varied widely. Some improvements in care There can be difficulty in identifying abuse and neglect in nursing homes, and so gathering that data has been a challenge, said David Stevenson, assistant professor of health policy at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, who has conducted research on negligence claims against nursing homes. \"We try to identify broader trends about quality of care, but specifically identifying abuse and neglect can be challenging,\" Stevenson said, adding that progress has been made recently.  \"Broadly speaking, I think there have been a lot of quality improvements in nursing home care over the last few decades,\" he said. \"But I also think that data have shown that also poor-quality care has been kind of frustratingly persistent and has been around for a long time.\" Stevenson added that he hopes Wednesday's hearing called attention to the issue. \"Hearing from the relatives of people who have suffered abuse and neglect in nursing homes will be incredibly important and powerful, and also hearing from industry leaders and researchers and those who are engaged in nursing home oversight and accountability I think will be really important,\" said Stevenson, who was not involved in the hearing. \"The big challenge of abuse and neglect in nursing homes is, I think, it has been persistent over a number of years,\" he said. \"I don't think it's incredibly prevalent, but really having any abuse and neglect in nursing homes is not acceptable.\"","24":" (CNN)On an emotional evening in Nantes, players and fans paid tribute to missing footballer Emiliano Sala in the French team's first match since the plane carrying the Argentine striker disappeared from radar last week.  Play was stopped in the ninth minute -- the player's squad number -- of the Ligue 1 match against Saint-Etienne as players and fans took part in a minute's applause, reducing Nantes manager Vahid Halilhodzic to tears.  Argentina flags and \"Sala\" scarves were waved in the stands and green armbands, symbolizing hope, were worn by players during the match.  READ: Seat cushions found believed to be from missing plane A video featuring the 28-year-old's highlights was played before the match and in the warm-up Nantes players wore white shirts bearing a photo of Sala and the message \"On t'aime Emi\" -- which translates as \"We love you Emi\" -- on the back, while a picture of the player covered the center circle.  As the players shook hands before kick-off, his name was spelled out by supporters using yellow and green cards in the stands.  READ: Touching tributes to Emiliano Sala Some Cardiff fans had traveled to the match, which ended in 1-1 draw, and held the same banner which was displayed before Cardiff's English Premier League match with Arsenal Tuesday.  \"We never saw you play and never saw you score but Emiliano our beautiful Bluebird we will love you forever more,\" it read.  Earlier Wednesday it was revealed that seat cushions believed to be from the plane carrying the missing footballer had been found on a beach in the northwest coast of France.  As a result, an underwater search was expected to take place at the end of this week, covering four square nautical miles and taking up to three days. The 28-year-old joined Cardiff City from French club Nantes for $19.3 million less than a fortnight ago and was traveling to the Welsh capital, having said goodbye to his former teammates, when the plane he was on board disappeared on January 21.  On Tuesday, Cardiff played Arsenal, losing 2-1, in the Welsh club's first game since the striker went missing and a minute's applause was also held at the Emirates Stadium before kick-off.  A crowdfunding initiative to finance a private search was launched last weekend in response to the decision by UK authorities to abandon its recovery mission last Thursday. French World Cup star Kylian Mbappe has donated $34,000, while his Paris Saint-Germain teammate Adrien Rabiot and Marseille's Dmitri Payet, as well as several other well known players from across Europe, have also made sizable donations to the campaign, which was set up by Sport Cover, the management agency that represents Sala. The Guernsey Harbour head of Port Operations manager told CNN Wednesday that the private search had started to be organized but was not yet underway.","25":"Denver (CNN)Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper on Monday announced he is running for president, launching a 2020 campaign in which he will lean on his Western roots and decades of executive experience.  He made the announcement in a video titled \"Standing Tall,\" which tracks Hickenlooper's life from laid-off geologist, to owner of a brew pub, to mayor of Denver and to governor, and touts the Democrat's experience in a variety of fields as a key reason he should be the person to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. Hickenlooper casts the President as a \"bully\" in the more than two-minute video. \"I'm running for president because we're facing a crisis that threatens everything we stand for,\" Hickenlooper says in the video as images of Trump play. \"As a skinny kid with coke bottle glasses and a funny last name, I've stood up to my fair share of bullies.\" He adds: \"I'm running for president because we need dreamers in Washington but we also need to get things done. I've proven again and again I can bring people together to produce the progressive change Washington has failed to deliver.\" Hickenlooper is the second governor to enter the crowded 2020 race after Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee announced a run last week. The field of Democrats is now at 14 candidates, including six senators. Hickenlooper will follow up the video with an appearance on Good Morning America on Monday. He will then headline a \"hometown send-off\" in Denver on Thursday at the city's Civic Center Park. Hickenlooper will be joined at the event by Colorado leaders throughout his time in the state, as well as Nathaniel Rateliff and the Night Sweats, a band based in Denver. Hickenlooper will then make his first post-announcement trip to Iowa on March 8 and March 9. He will then cap his announcement week with an appearance at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. Hickenlooper has been teasing a 2020 run for months, telling CNN in January that he would bet on the fact that he was going to run for President. \"I've been known to play a little cards,\" Hickenlooper said during the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington, D.C. \"Given that there is still uncertainty in the future, I probably would take the bet that I would run for President.\" His political action committee -- Giddy Up PAC -- also staffed up earlier this year by hiring senior communications adviser Marie Logsden, finance director Dan Sorenson and adding foreign policy adviser Jeremy Rosner to a committee that already includes Brad Komar, Hickenlooper's 2014 campaign manager and someone who would likely assume a senior role in a presidential bid. And the committee has been flying prospective campaign aides to Denver for interviews with the governor. Hickenlooper is seen as a dark horse for the presidency, in part because he doesn't have the national profile of other Democratic candidates, but he and his team hope that his record of achievement in Colorado, including his ability to work with Republicans, will set him apart. Born in Pennsylvania in 1952, Hickenlooper attended Wesleyan University, where he received a master's degree in geology. The field brought him to Colorado, where he worked for in Buckhorn Petroleum, but a downturn in the industry in the 80s led him to be laid off.  During his unemployment, Hickenlooper traveled to California, saw a brewpub in Oakland and thought that concept would work in Denver. It led him to open Wynkoop Brewing Company in 1988, a large brewpub that went on to help reinvigorate the LoDo area of Denver and made Hickenlooper a wealthy man with enough money to fund, invest and run breweries across the country. The success of Wynkoop -- and Hickenlooper's connections to Denver that grew out of that -- led him to successfully run for mayor of Denver in 2003, a position he held for eight years before serving two terms as Colorado's governor from 2011 to 2019. The governor's electoral history includes winning re-election in 2014, an election cycle that saw a number of Democrats lose their jobs. Hickenlooper's eight years as governor were defined by a series of tragedies, namely catastrophic wildfires and floods in 2013 and the 2012 shooting in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, that left 12 people dead. And the former mayor spent considerable time working with Republicans in the state to pass methane gas regulations and expand Medicaid. \"Some of his biggest supporters have been prominent statewide Republicans,\" said Max Potter, Hickenlooper's former senior media advisor and speechwriter. That ability to appeal to Republicans has led Hickenlooper to have a national reputation as a moderate executive. \"What John brings to the table may not 'excite' the Ocasio-Cortez base,\" Potter said, referencing the liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from New York, \"but what it should excite is the chance for a Democratic party to beat Donald Trump\" Floyd Ciruli, an independent pollster in Colorado and the professor of Public Opinion and Foreign Policy at the University of Denver, said that centrist reputation could be an issue in a Democratic primary. \"If these voters were unaffiliated or independent then he'd have a much easier time,\" Ciruli said. \"The worst time he ever had in his life was when he went far to the left.\" Democrats in Washington and in Colorado have pushed Hickenlooper to challenge Republican Sen. Cory Gardner, who is up for reelection in 2020. But Hickenlooper had said he dreaded the idea of being a legislator after years as an executive.  Far from a liberal firebrand, Hickenlooper believes that there is a portion of the Democratic primary electorate that is hungry for someone who is able to defeat Trump without getting into the gutter with him. \"I think there is a silent majority,\" Hickenlooper told CNN in January, \"a new silent majority that wants to elect people that get stuff done, stop fighting, stop hurling invective and roll up their sleeves and start working together.\"","26":" (CNN)President Donald Trump's ex-attorney Michael Cohen has postponed his congressional testimony before a second House committee, as the House Intelligence panel has scrapped his planned Friday appearance. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said in a statement that Cohen's closed-door testimony would be postponed until later this month. \"In the interests of the investigation, Michael Cohen's testimony has been postponed until February 28th,\" said Schiff, a Democrat from California. Schiff would not comment further on what he was referring to in citing \"the interests of the investigation.\"   \"Mr. Cohen has been fully cooperative with us and we hope and expect that will continue. But it was in the investigation's interest that we postpone to that date,\" he told reporters Wednesday. It's the second time that a House committee has announced that Cohen would be appearing, only for it later to be postponed. Cohen was also scheduled to testify publicly before the House Oversight Committee on Thursday, but Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings announced last month that the hearing was postponed. A new date has not been announced. Cohen was also subpoenaed to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee next week. Cohen's congressional testimony comes before he is slated to begin a three-year prison sentence on March 6. Cohen was sentenced in December after pleading guilty to tax and campaign finance crimes, as well as lying to Congress in his 2017 testimony.  This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.","27":" (CNN)The House of Representatives on Friday passed a key priority of the new Democratic majority: A sweeping legislative proposal that Democrats call HR 1 that seeks to enact wide-ranging ethics reform, expand voting rights and mandate the disclosure of presidential tax returns. The vote was 234 to 193 and the measure passed along party lines.  Congressional Republicans have criticized the legislation as an attempted power grab by Democrats, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made clear it won't be taken up in the Senate. The White House has also issued a veto threat on the measure.  But the legislation was still a key campaign promise for Democrats and a way to send a message to voters about the kind of government reforms the party would pursue if it wins back the Senate and the presidency. Efforts by House Democrats to focus attention on HR 1 were largely overshadowed this week by an internal Democratic debate over how to respond to controversy surrounding freshmen Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who has ignited criticism within the party over comments related to Israel.  The House passed a resolution on Thursday condemning both anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim discrimination as well as other forms of hate and intolerance. By Friday, however, Democrats had largely succeeded in re-focusing attention on HR 1, a massive legislative package that runs hundreds of pages in length. It reads like a list of liberal priorities on fighting government corruption, reforming campaign finance and making it easier for people to vote. And House Democrats have described the measure as proof that the party is working to restore the American public's faith in democracy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to Republicans calling HR 1 a power grab during a news conference on Friday, saying \"Yes, it is a power grab\u2014a power grab on behalf of the people.\" Pelosi briefly stood next to Omar during the news conference. They greeted each other, as they both held tiny American flags. Ethics and campaign finance reform The legislative package calls for far-reaching ethics and government changes that would impact Congress, the President and even the Supreme Court.  HR 1 would ban congressional lawmakers from sitting on corporate boards. It would also stop lawmakers from using taxpayer money to reach settlements in employment discrimination cases stemming from their own actions.  It would also institute an ethics code for the US Supreme Court that would apply to high court justices.  The bill is aimed at lessening the influence of big money in politics and it takes aim at Citizens United, the landmark 2010 Supreme Court decision, by calling for a constitutional amendment to overturn the high court ruling that opened the door to unlimited spending by corporations and unions to influence elections.  While Republicans argue the bill is overreaching and limits free political speech, Democrats simply point to a key campaign pledge made by President Donald Trump to \"drain the swamp.\"  \"I do not know how you could have the hypocrisy and the gall to support a presidential campaign that calls for the swamp to be drained and then say this is dead on arrival,\" said Democratic Rep. Max Rose of New York.  Presidential tax returns  The legislation would require US presidents, vice presidents and presidential nominees to disclose their tax returns. Specifically, it requires the release of 10 years of personal and business tax returns -- a provision that would apply to the current President.   Trump broke with past precedent by refusing to release his tax returns while running for office.  The tax section of the bill underwent changes in the week before the vote with liberals fighting to also include a measure that would require candidates to disclose business tax returns as well, a nod to Democratic questions about Trump's own finances and whether they influence decisions he's making in office.   The question of business tax disclosures has become a hot button issue on the House Ways and Means Committee where Chairman Richard Neal is expected to formally request the President's tax returns in upcoming weeks. It's unclear what precisely Neal would request using an arcane IRS code that Democrats believe gives the chairman the ability to request Trump's personal tax information, but the drafting of HR 1 has largely been seen as a reflection of what the House Ways and Means committee's priorities could be.  Members of the House Ways and Means Committee have been pushing Neal to make Trump's business returns a target of his inquiry in addition to pushing for them to be included in HR 1, arguing that the business returns could help other congressional committees with their own investigations.  Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, a member of the Ways and Means Committee, told CNN that he believes Neal should request the business returns.  \"I think if you're going to do this, you have to do it right, it should be business returns and it should be of course personal returns,\" he said.  Voting rights and elections HR 1 also seeks to advance a number of long-standing liberal agenda items with respect to voting and elections, including provisions that Democrats say will make it easier to vote and protect voting rights. The legislation requires states to create and operate a system for automatic voter registration for federal elections via an opt-out system. It would restore the right to vote in federal elections to former felons who have served out their sentences.  Democrats also say they want to give voters more opportunities to vote, and the bill requires 15 days of early voting in states for federal elections. Republicans criticize legislation as a power grab  Republicans have criticized the bill as overreach regarding states' rights to manage elections and a major attempt to limit free speech in political and advocacy campaigns by trying to reduce spending.  This was a key point made by McConnell in a news conference Wednesday designed to explicitly attack the bill, which he called a \"terrible proposal\" that won't be brought up in the Senate.  It's rare for McConnell to hold news conferences outside his regular weekly conference -- particularly on a bill that he's not expected to bring up -- but HR1 touches on issues, namely campaign finance reform, that have been a key topic of his throughout his career.  House GOP whip Steve Scalise framed the issue during the same news conference by calling it \"a choice between freedom and socialism\" and arguing the legislation would infringe on American's First Amendment rights. Pressed on why he's letting the Green New Deal get a vote -- which he also opposes -- and not HR 1, McConnell quipped to reporters Wednesday: \"Because I get to decide what we vote on.\" This story has been updated to reflect additional developments Friday.","28":" (CNN)Trade talks between the United States and the European Union remain at an impasse after the most recent round of negotiations in Washington last week, President Donald Trump's top negotiator told Congress on Tuesday.   US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the United States has reached a \"complete stalemate\" with the EU over intractable agricultural demands, though Trump and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker declared in a Rose Garden press conference last year that the two leaders had agreed to the makings of a deal. \"We're at a stalemate,\" Lighthizer told the Senate Finance Committee. \"The United States can't have a trade agreement with Europe that doesn't deal with agriculture, and their view is that they can't have one that does,\" he said. The Rose Garden comments last July de-escalated tensions stemming from Trump's imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs and subsequent retaliatory tariffs from the EU on a range of American products -- as well as Trump's still-looming threat to slap tariffs on European cars. In some ways, the preliminary European deal was quite narrow. It applied a \"zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies\" goal only to non-auto industrial goods, and a joint statement from Trump and Juncker at the time made no mention of agricultural products beyond soybeans. Yet Lighthizer included an array of ambitious agriculture goals in January when the United States released its negotiating objectives for the potential trade agreement.  Agricultural products were a point of major contention during negotiations for the Obama-era Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, and the EU is adamant about avoiding the historically tricky subject altogether. \"We have been very clear that from the EU side that we will not discuss agriculture,\" European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said in January. Lighthizer and Malmstr\u00f6m met again on March 6, but the pair don't appear any closer to a solution on the issue. \"We're at a complete stalemate with them,\" Lighthizer reiterated during his testimony on Tuesday. \"We're working on other areas with the realization that there's not going to be any [free trade agreement] without agriculture.\" Lighthizer said pressure from Congress to open up the EU market to American farmers is strong enough that a deal without agricultural provisions would be dead on arrival. \"It wouldn't even make any difference if we conceded or not,\" he said.","29":" (CNN)Dillon Hooley loves his parents, so when he heard last year they were struggling to pay for his insulin, he wanted to help out any way he could. The high school senior came up with an idea: He would cut back on his insulin by about a third. Dillon, who has type1 diabetes, is supposed to keep his blood sugar levels between 130 and 150. After he started rationing insulin, his levels jumped as high as 300. He knew that was dangerously high, and in the back of his mind he worried he might go into a diabetic coma.\"I wasn't thinking right, but my parents work so hard to give me what I need, and I didn't want to put more financial stress on them,\" said Dillon, now 18. Skyrocketing insulin prices From 2012 until 2016, the cost of insulin for people with type1 diabetes nearly doubled, from $2,864 per year to $5,705, according to a study out this month from the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit research institute. The cost of Dillon's insulin was much higher. He was insured last year through his father's job at a steel mill in Utah. When Dillon started rationing his insulin, the mill had just switched to an insurance plan with a high deductible, which meant his parents would have to pay $5,000 out of their own pocket before the insurance would kick in. Under this new insurance, the Hooleys had to pay $800 a month for Dillon's insulin, instead of the $60 a month they'd paid under their old plan. Preoccupied with his family's financial woes, Dillon's father, Jason Hooley, was at work and didn't notice that a 400 pound steel beam was about to fall on his middle finger.  He lost half of his finger and could only do light work at the mill. With his hours cut back, he earned $300 less a week. That's when Dillon secretly started cutting back on his insulin. His parents found out when he went in for a regular doctor's appointment and the doctor was shocked at his high blood sugar levels. Dillon's father then switched jobs twice to get better health insurance.  Now the family pays $160 a month for his insulin, which is better than $800 a month, but still a financial struggle for the family of five. Dillon has gone back to taking his full doses of insulin under his mother's watchful eye. Mindie Hooley cries when she thinks about what her son did to help his parents. \"He's such a selfless person,\" she said. \"My heart just broke, because you want to do everything to protect him, but instead he was protecting us.\" Promises from lawmakers Some people with diabetes haven't survived the rising price of insulin. In 2017, 22-year-old Antavia Worsham from Cincinatti died when she couldn't afford her insulin. Her mother, Antroinette Worsham, testified Tuesday on Capitol Hill to the House Oversight and Reform Committee. A Senate committee also held a hearing Tuesday on rising drug prices. \"This is unacceptable, and I intend to specifically get to the bottom of the insulin price increase,\" Sen. Charles Grassley, chair of the Senate Finance Committee said at the hearing. The pharmaceutical industry says patients with insurance, like the Hooleys, shouldn't have to pay full price, as insulin makers give deep discounts to insurance companies. \"These savings are often not shared with patients whose out-of-pocket costs continue to soar,\" said Holly Campell, spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. A spokeswoman for the insurance industry, however, said that's not true. \"Savings from rebates go directly to customers,\" said Cathryn Donaldson, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans. In December of 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland asked the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether insulin manufacturers had colluded on drug prices. In October, the Minnesota attorney general's office filed a lawsuit against insulin makers alleging illegal pricing practices. A lawsuit filed by patients with diabetes in Massachusetts accusing insulin makers of price fixing is pending in federal court. Dillon's future While drug and insurance companies point fingers at each other, the Hooleys are still struggling to pay the $160 a month for Dillon's insulin, along with other supplies such as his test strips.  Paying for his insulin has made it impossible for Dillon's parents to save up enough to buy him a glucose monitor that sets off an alarm if his blood sugar gets too low while he sleeps.  They know he needs one. Last month his mother checked in on him while he was sleeping and saw he didn't look right. She woke him up and gave him some honey, but he was so confused from his low blood sugar that instead of eating it he smeared the honey all over his body. An ambulance brought him o the emergency room, where was stabilized and released. After graduating from high school last May, Dillon wanted to go to school to become a nurse or a respiratory therapist. Instead, he got a job at the factory where his father works to help pay for his insulin and to save up for school. He looks back on his two and a half months of insulin rationing, and knows he made the wrong choice -- but it was a choice borne from love. \"My parents do so much for me, and it was so hard to watch them struggle financially,\" he said. \"I felt helpless not to be able to contribute.\"","30":"Washington (CNN)White House press secretary Sarah Sanders reasserted during Monday's press briefing that President Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, lied before Congress last month when he claimed that he never asked the President for a pardon.  \"I'm not going to get into specifics of things that are currently under review by the (House) Oversight Committee and other committees. What I can tell you is that Cohen's own attorney stated and contradicted his client when he said he was aware that those conversations had taken place,\" Sanders said.  \"We know Michael Cohen lied to Congress prior to his testimony, most recently. We know he's lied at least twice in that hearing. I think that it's time to stop giving him a platform. Let him go on to serve his time and let's move forward,\" she added.  Cohen told members of Congress last month that he never asked the President for a pardon.   \"I have never asked for it, nor would I accept a pardon from President Trump,\" Cohen had testified. Multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN that the prospect of a Cohen pardon was raised more than once between Cohen's lawyer and attorneys representing the President. The depth of those discussions -- including whether a pardon was truly on the table in exchange for Cohen's cooperation -- is being disputed publicly among the different factions.  Cohen's current attorney, Lanny Davis, said that Cohen's testimony is not inconsistent with his legal team's inquiry into a pardon. He said in a statement that prior to Cohen's decision to leave a joint defense agreement with Trump's legal team and cooperate with federal investigators, Cohen \"was open to the ongoing 'dangling' of a possible pardon by Trump representatives privately and in the media.\" But Trump has insisted that Cohen lied about the matter, tweeting aboard Air Force One on Friday that Cohen's lawyers \"totally contradicted him. He lied!\" \"Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again! He also badly wanted to work at the White House. He lied!\" Trump continued.  Congressional investigators are now looking into the pardon discussions.  During Monday's briefing, Sanders also refused to address the issue of Trump's checks to Cohen while occupying the Oval Office, allegedly to refund hush money payments, instead referring reporters to the President's personal attorneys. Pressed further, Sanders only reiterated Trump's claim that he did not violate any campaign finance laws and referred reporters to the President's personal attorneys. Sanders also declined to say whether Trump is indeed \"Individual-1,\" as referenced in federal court documents related to the special counsel's investigation. \"I'm not going to comment on an ongoing case,\" Sanders said. Cohen said in his congressional testimony last month that Trump is \"Individual-1.\" Sanders was also asked why the President has not ruled out a pardon for his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.  \"The President has made his position on that clear,\" Sanders replied. \"He'll make a decision when he's ready.\"","31":" (CNN)One of K-pop's biggest idols has dramatically quit the entertainment industry after it emerged he is being investigated on suspicion of violating South Korea's prostitution law. The youngest member of K-Pop mega-group Big Bang, Seungri made the announcement on his official Instagram account on Tuesday.    \"I think I'd better leave the entertainment industry at this moment,\" he wrote. \"I just cannot bear causing any further damage to people around me, while being hated and criticized by the public and being treated as a nation's enemy during the investigation.\" Seungri has for years maintained the squeaky-clean image required of South Korean entertainers. But in recent months a scandal dogging the Burning Sun nightclub in Seoul, which Seungri sat on the board of, had put that reputation in danger. It had also caused some to question how clean-cut K-pop idols really are. The Burning Sun club, located in the upscale Gangnam neighborhood, faces allegations of bribery, violence against customers, securing prostitutes for VIPs, rape, drug trafficking and drug use, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Police. Numerous women have come forward with claims of being assaulted or drugged at the club, which the authorities have been investigating for two months.  Burning Sun last month posted a statement on social media saying it was \"actively cooperating\" with the police. It had also promised to introduce measures to protect customers, including female security officers and extra surveillance cameras. But since then the hotel in which it is located said Burning Sun has opted to end its lease early and close. The club did not respond to a request for comment. Last month, 28-year-old Seungri, who also oversaw publicity for Burning Sun, resigned from the club's board. Neither Seungri or his label, YG Entertainment, responded to CNN's request for comment, but a statement from the label said that he and its executives were cooperating with police. According to multiple reports, Seungri apologized on stage at a concert on February 14 and canceled events in Osaka and Jakarta this month. But, in the end, those efforts were not enough to save his career. \"I'm truly grateful for all my fans in Korea and in the world for showing much love for the past 10 years,\" he wrote on social media. \"I feel that I need to end it here for the reputation of YG and Big Bang.\"  Spiraling scandal  K-Pop stars are expected to conform to notoriously high standards of conduct, both from their management and fans. Their labels impose restrictions on who and how publicly they can date, what they wear and how they behave in public. Big Bang has been at the forefront of the K-Pop industry since its debut in 2006, and was the first Korean group to win the Best Worldwide Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2011. That success put additional pressure on Seungri. CedarBough Saeji, an expert in Korean culture and society at the University of British Columbia, said that for K-Pop stars: \"Their every public moment is a product to be consumed as representative of the nation, representative of ideal behavior, and representative of performative talent.\"  Jenna Gibson, a Korea expert at the University of Chicago, said that if the allegations against Seungri and Burning Sun were true, \"this level of scandal goes beyond anything we've seen in recent memory\" in K-pop. Drug laws are exceptionally strict in South Korea and drug use is also rare. Only about 7,800 arrests were made in 2017, according to the Korean Statistical Information Service, in a country of more than 51 million people.  Celebrities caught with even small amounts of marijuana can find themselves suspended by labels or forced to make public apologies.   \"Scandals involving drinking, drugs or even dating not only make waves in the entertainment news section but also the finance news section,\" Bernie Cho, a Korean music industry executive, told CNN last year.  \"Many of the biggest Korean music management companies are also publicly traded stocks on the Korean stock exchange. Sensational headlines can take a serious hit on the bottom line.\" Often in the wake of a scandal, labels and stars will cancel events -- as Seungri has done -- and postpone record releases until attention in the story wanes.  Gibson predicted Seungri might choose to begin his mandatory military service early in order to get out of the public eye.  All South Korean men are required to perform between 18 and 21 months of public service, something that can be devastating for entertainers' careers. But in this case it could benefit Seungri.  Gender divide  Fresh accusations around the Burning Sun scandal have been appearing in the Korean press almost every day. There is huge public appetite for the story because part of the case resonates with an ongoing reckoning with attitudes in South Korea towards women, said Korean culture expert Saeji. Last year, tens of thousands of women took to the streets of Seoul to protest against an epidemic of illegal filming and sexual harassment, under the slogan \"My Life is Not Your Porn.\"  An increasingly active women's movement has also taken aim at the country's gender divide and pay gap, one of the worst in the developed world, which President Moon Jae-in has described as \"shameful\" and pledged to improve. In 2018, the country ranked 30 out of 36 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nations for women's employment, even though it has the highest tertiary education rate of the group for women aged 25 to 34.  Politics is particularly unequal. Women hold just 17% of seats in South Korea's parliament, according to the World Bank. Saeji said that the Burning Sun scandal came at a time when such issues \"are being faced by society more directly than ever before.\"  Like the spy cam epidemic -- which exposed a constant unease many South Korean women felt about being watched, both in public and private -- the nightclub scandal, particularly the allegations regarding date rape and sexual assault, has painted a picture of a predatory environment many women know only too well.  \"Many Korean women have had unfortunate or scary experiences at clubs, and some men are also aware and outraged about this sort of predatory and illegal behavior,\" Saeji said.  The presence of Seungri on the board, who as a K-Pop star \"presumed to represent the best role model for young Korean men,\" only heightens the anger over it, she added.","32":"In this new weekly column \"Cross-exam,\" Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, gives his take on the latest legal news and answers questions from readers. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on \"CNN Newsroom\" at 5 p.m. ET Sundays. Public attention has turned increasingly to the Mueller report in the wake of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker's combative (and evasive) testimony to Congress following his declaration that Mueller is \"close to being completed\"; the likely imminent confirmation of attorney general nominee William Barr, who will receive the report from Mueller and decide where it goes next; and the brash proclamation from President Donald Trump's former attorney John Dowd that \"I don't think there'll be a report.\"' Dowd is wrong. There will be a Mueller report. The special counsel regulations require Mueller to \"provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions.\" And Whitaker confirmed to Congress that \"we have followed the special counsel's regulation to a T.\"  The big question -- which you asked, and I answer below -- is what happens to the report after the attorney general gets it from Mueller.     As Joan Biskupic notes, history provides two divergent models for what the Mueller report could contain. In 1974, Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski filed a concise \"road map\" setting forth factual findings to Congress without drawing legal conclusions. In 1998, independent counsel Kenneth Starr issued a novel-length report detailing alleged offenses arising from President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.  While issuance of the Mueller report will be a pivotal moment in the Trump presidency, it will not mark the end of Trump's legal troubles. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and others already have begun flexing their newfound subpoena power, and the Southern District of New York's probes of the Trump Organization and the Trump inaugural committee continue to expand. Trump smartly beefed up his legal team in anticipation of the battles to come.  In other news, after protracted hearings, a federal judge determined that former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort intentionally lied on three of five points to the FBI, Mueller and a grand jury. This means that Manafort is going to get hammered at sentencing; I'd expect the 69-year-old Manafort -- who already has been convicted at trial, pleaded guilty to additional offenses and now poured gasoline on the fire by lying while trying to cooperate -- to receive a sentence that will keep him behind bars for most or all of his life.  In the broader sense, it means the judge has sided with Mueller's prosecutors, who argued that Manafort intentionally lied to cover up his dealings with Konstantin Kilimnik -- including providing Kilimnik, who has been linked with the Russian intelligence agency, with internal polling data during the heat of the 2016 election -- which goes \"very much to the heart of what the special counsel is investigating.\"     Now, your questions. Shrisha: Is it possible that Mueller completes his report, but the general public never sees it because Trump and his attorney general do not permit it to be released? The attorney general, after receiving the report, has broad discretion under the special counsel regulations about whether and how to provide the report to Congress and the public. Trump recently stated that the decision is \"totally up to the attorney general\" -- then immediately contradicted himself by saying \"I don't know. It depends.\" Any effort by Trump to suppress the report would come at his own political peril, given a new Washington Post-Schar School poll showing that 81% of Americans favor its public release. Once he receives the Mueller report, Barr will have several options available. He could provide the entire report (perhaps with classified information redacted) to Congress and the public. Or he could lock the report in a safe and show it to nobody -- though this seems unlikely given Barr's testimony that he would \"provide as much transparency as I can.\"   The critical legal and political battles will happen in the middle ground. Will Trump and his attorneys seek to remove information from the report based on claims of executive privilege? Will Barr accept their objections? If not, will Trump challenge the report in court, and will Barr stand his ground? If the report goes only to Congress, will Schiff make good on his vow to do \"everything possible\" to make it available to the general public? Prepare for a multifront legal and political battle.        Susan: If Trump can't be indicted while in office, can he be charged immediately after he leaves office? And what is the statute of limitations on all the crimes he may have committed?   While there is a healthy debate about whether a sitting president can and should be indicted -- current Department of Justice policy counsels against indictment, scholars differ and no court has ruled on the issue -- he certainly can be charged with a crime once he is out of office. But there are two big caveats. First, a president might be pardoned by his successor (as Richard Nixon was pardoned by Gerald Ford) or perhaps even by himself before he leaves office (though the courts have never addressed whether a president can legally pardon himself). Second, any criminal charge must be brought within a time limit known as the statute of limitations. For most federal crimes, the statute of limitations is five years. So, if a president wins election to two terms covering eight years, any crime he committed before the first election or in his first three years in office might be precluded. But there is a counterargument that the statute of limitations should be put on hold while a president is in office, if he cannot be charged while in office.  Mark: Can an agreement to pardon an individual for the purpose of obstructing an investigation be a crime?  The courts have never ruled on this issue, one of many seemingly far-fetched law school hypotheticals that now may spring to life. Some -- including Trump's attorneys and Barr -- argue that the president has broad constitutional powers, including the pardon power, and it cannot be a crime for the president to exercise those powers.  I disagree. To take an extreme example: If the president tweeted, \"Pardons for sale, $25,000 each, cash only!\" that would have to qualify as bribery. By that measure, if a president uses the pardon power to commit some other crime -- for example, to prevent a witness from testifying -- then that pardon could constitute obstruction of justice. A president certainly has broad powers, but that does not mean he is above the law.  David: If the election was proven tainted, would it be invalidated? And if the answer to that is \"yes,\" do all of Trump's appointments also become invalidated -- such as his Supreme Court picks and members of his administration?  Even if a president was impeached, removed from office and\/or convicted of a crime, there is no way -- legally or practically -- to unwind the decisions he made during his term in office. Though Nixon wasn't technically impeached, none of his Supreme Court or other judicial nominations were undone after his resignation. Even after Clinton was impeached (though he was not ultimately convicted by the Senate and removed from office), there was no attempt to remove his appointments.  I believe the law makes good sense here. A president makes dozens of consequential decisions every day. Where would we even start if we had to undo everything a tainted president did? Un-appoint all of his hundreds of appointments? Invalidate every law he signed? Take back the money allocated in his budgets? The government would fall into chaos. Coke: How does Mueller's mandate differ from Kenneth Starr's? Mueller's mandate is to investigate \"coordination between the Russian government\" and the Trump campaign (and directly related matters). Starr also began with a defined mandate: to investigate financial dealings between Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and various banks and investment companies (\"Whitewater\"). Nearly four years into his investigation -- take note, those who say Mueller is taking too long -- Starr sought and received permission to expand his mandate to include perjury and other crimes arising from Clinton's affair with Lewinsky.    Mueller and Starr served under different laws, and those differences will influence who gets to see Mueller's report. The independent counsel statute (which is no longer effective) under which Starr served required him to provide a written report to Congress. Starr, accordingly, filed his memorably lascivious report directly with Congress and the public. The special counsel regulations, by contrast, require that Mueller send his findings confidentially to the attorney general, who in turn can decide to provide all, some or none of the report to Congress and the public. So, Mueller operates under a less transparent legal regime than Starr did.     Ed: Have you considered the \"ostrich defense\" we're likely to encounter from Team Trump?  The \"ostrich defense\" refers to a defendant who \"buries his head in the sand,\" enabling him to claim he had no idea about criminality happening around him. Typically, you'll see this defense from bosses -- corporate CEOs, mafia bosses or political leaders who try to distance themselves from wrongdoing by their subordinates. The law says that if a person genuinely did not know what was happening -- even if his closest associates were doing it -- he cannot be held responsible.   But the law also recognizes an important doctrine called \"willful blindness\": If a defendant intentionally closed his eyes to something that should have been obvious to him, then he has the requisite guilty knowledge just the same as if he had actual knowledge. So, the more people around him who get convicted of crimes, and the more pervasive the criminality within an organization, the harder it is for any boss to get away with the \"I had no idea\" defense.          Tim: We understand that in the American Media Inc.\/David Pecker immunity agreement (protecting them from prosecution by the Southern District of New York for making hush money payments to Karen McDougal, potentially violating campaign finance laws), they agreed not to commit any more crimes. In this type of agreement, would AMI have to be convicted of a crime to violate the agreement, or is it a crime if the prosecutors decide it is?  AMI first got in trouble in late 2018 for making hush money payments to McDougal, potentially violating campaign finance laws. However, the Southern District of New York gave AMI a deal: You cooperate, you stay out of further trouble, and we won't prosecute you for campaign finance violations.     Simple enough -- until last week, when AMI seemingly extorted Jeff Bezos. (AMI has said it is conducting an investigation into the matter.)  If so, then AMI and its principals can be prosecuted both for (1) extorting Bezos and (2) campaign finance violations, because they have violated their non-prosecution agreement with the Southern District of New York by committing a new crime (the Bezos extortion).  The Southern District of New York does not have to go to a jury and get a conviction to void the non-prosecution agreement; the agreement itself states that is up to the district whether AMI has committed a crime and violated the deal.   Bottom line: AMI seemingly had gotten itself a free pass, but now it's in double trouble.  3 questions for the next week: 1) With Manafort now looking at a very long sentence, will Trump rescue him with a pardon?  2) Assuming Barr is confirmed as attorney general, will he limit or end Mueller's obstruction of justice probe, which Barr previously derided as \"fatally misconceived\" and \"asinine\"? 3) Will Schiff's decision to send dozens of interview transcripts to Mueller result in additional indictments, and, if so, who should be losing sleep? ","33":"Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor, is a CNN legal analyst and a Rutgers University scholar. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Two critical points at the outset. First, Barr's letter is not the Mueller report; it is a four-page distillation. There is no reason to believe Barr has distorted Mueller's report, but -- as anyone who ever skated through English class using Cliff's Notes can attest -- a summary can be a pale substitute for the real thing. Second, Barr's letter appropriately applies the standards of criminal law. That is, Barr employs the familiar \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" burden of proof necessary to convict a defendant of a crime. Further Congressional action is a separate, and political, question.  As such, Barr delivers a decisive exoneration of Trump and the administration on the question of criminal conspiracy or coordination with Russia. Again, remember: Barr reports that Mueller found insufficient evidence to charge a federal crime, but not necessarily that Mueller found no evidence whatsoever.   The coordination inquiry took place in between two undisputed factual pillars:  (1) the Russian state hacked various e-mail accounts associated with Hillary Clinton in an effort to help Trump win the 2016 election, and (2) Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged, even in a cheeky fashion, the Russian hacking effort (\"if it's what you say I love it;\" \"Russia, if you're listening...\"). Trump claimed he was joking.  We also know the Trump campaign had dozens of contact with Russians, and that several campaign officials and advisers -- Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen, George Papadopoulos -- admitted to lying to the FBI or Congress about those contacts.  The question, then, was whether there was enough connective tissue between Russia's efforts to interfere in the election and the Trump campaign's desire to benefit from those efforts to support a criminal charge. Barr today delivered a clear answer: no. The obstruction part of Barr's letter is more complicated. Barr notes that Mueller \"did not draw a conclusion -- one way or the other -- as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction.\" Barr also quotes this key line from Mueller's report: \"While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\" Mueller punted on the obstruction question. While I have the highest possible regard for Mueller as a prosecutor -- I'd be happy to be half the prosecutor he is -- this was an unusual move. Prosecutors make difficult, and often razor's edge-close calls about criminal charges all the time. Mueller has been a paragon of decisiveness throughout his career, so this \"hard pass\" is tough to understand.  Once the ball landed in Barr's hands, it was easy to tell what he would do on obstruction. Remember: In June 2018 -- before Trump chose him as Attorney General -- Barr sent an unsolicited, detailed 19-page memo to the Justice Department arguing that Mueller's \"obstruction theory is fatally misconceived.\" Barr previously offered The Hill a more plainspoken assessment, calling the obstruction investigation \"asinine.\" Barr also wrote, \"There is no legal prohibition -- as opposed to a political constraint -- against the President's acting on a matter in which he has a personal stake.\" Translation: The President is the head of the Executive Branch, the Justice Department is part of the Executive Branch, so the President seemingly can do whatever he wants regarding the Justice Department -- even if intended to protect himself. The focus now shifts to Congress. First, Congress must ascertain whether Barr gave the thumbs-down to obstruction charges because of insufficient evidence or because of his extreme and untested views on presidential authority. Congress also must make an important political calculation: Even if there is not proof of obstruction beyond a reasonable doubt, is there enough for Congress to justify further proceedings? Other battles lie ahead. House Democrats will fight like mad to get not just Mueller's report, but also the evidence that underlies it. Leaders of the House also have stated that they intend to subpoena Barr and perhaps Mueller. This means we are likely to see a series of legal and political battles -- over the authority of the Legislative Branch to compel testimony from the Executive Branch, grand jury secrecy and executive privilege -- each of which carries broad constitutional implications. Through all of this, Trump still faces many investigations -- criminal, civil and legislative. The most potent threat comes from my former office, the Southern District of New York (SDNY), which already has convicted Michael Cohen and reportedly is digging deep on potential campaign finance violations, the Trump Organization and the Trump inaugural committee. While I do not expect the SDNY to defy existing Justice Department policy and indict a sitting president, the investigations nonetheless could expose criminal wrongdoing by Trump and others in his orbit (the latter group being subject to indictment based on sufficient evidence, of course). Mueller's investigation, long seen as an existential threat to Trump's presidency, will not end with the President in handcuffs. Barr's letter all but assures that. But many high-stakes showdowns still lie ahead -- for the President, Justice Department, Congress and the courts.","34":" (CNN)Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's one-time personal attorney and fixer, is testifying before the House Oversight Committee Wednesday -- likely the only chance the public will have to hear from him before he is sent to jail in May for a series of tax and campaign finance charges.  Cohen's testimony is one of the biggest moments of Trump's time in office and among the most high-profile hearings on Capitol Hill in modern political memory. I watched Cohen's testimony throughout the day, plucked out key lines from him and added context and analysis.  These lines are in the chronological order in which Cohen said them. 1. \"I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.\" These lines, from Cohen's opening statement, set the tone for the day. And the tone is this: Cohen is not going to be pulling any punches on Trump. A man who spent a decade at the right hand of the current President of the United States is now saying on the record that that man is a \"racist,\" a \"conman\" and a \"cheat.\" We've grown used to the abnormal in Trump's White House, but even by that standard, this is a \"whoa\" moment. 2. \"He was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails.\" And boom goes the dynamite. This is a Very Big Deal.  Remember that Trump told The New York Times earlier this year that he had never spoken to Stone -- who has been indicted on charges that he lied to Congress about the nature and extent of his dealing with WikiLeaks -- about the DNC emails hacked by the Russians and then released to do maximum damage to Hillary Clinton's campaign. \"No, I didn't. I never did,\" Trump said when asked whether he talked to Stone about the stolen emails. The Times also pressed on whether Trump told anyone, including Stone, to get in touch with WikiLeaks to see when they were planning to drop the emails. \"Never did,\" Trump responded. 3. \"A copy of a check Mr. Trump wrote from his personal bank account -- after he became president -- to reimburse me for the hush money payments I made to cover up his affair with an adult film star and prevent damage to his campaign.\" Cohen has the receipts -- literally! The check -- for $35,000 -- is dated August 1, 2017, and signed in Trump's very distinctive script. That date is, obviously, after Trump became president. And if Cohen is to be believed, it also directly contradicts Trump's assertions in April 2018 that he knew nothing about where Cohen got the money to keep porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal -- both of whom alleged affairs with Trump -- quiet during the 2016 campaign.   Of course, a check signed to Cohen is not proof that the money was a reimbursement for the hush payments -- although the check is consistent with Cohen's version of events and the version of events that prosecutors in the Southern District of New York seem to believe: That Trump played a role in coordinating and orchestrating the payments to Daniels and McDougal in a clear end-run of campaign finance laws. 4. \"Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That's not how he operates.\" This from Cohen directly disputes reporting from BuzzFeed News that Cohen was instructed to lie by the President. Special counsel Robert Mueller's office released a statement that took issue with the BuzzFeed reporting shortly after it published. 5. \"There were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa Caucus in January 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me 'How's it going in Russia?' -- referring to the Moscow Tower project.\" This sheds light on the breadth of Trump's interest in and conversations about Trump Tower Moscow. What we knew prior to today is that Cohen lied to Congress when he told them that all conversations with the Russians about the development had stopped by January 2016. Cohen later admitted that he had lied about that because he was concerned it might hurt Trump's presidential chances if people knew that the conversations had continued all the way into the summer of 2016. 6. \"Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.\" A few things here are relevant. First, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in January that Trump was involved in discussions about the possible Trump Tower Moscow project all the way through the election. (Giuliani later said he was speaking only hypothetically about what Trump knew when.) Second, both that admission from Giuliani and Cohen's claim seem to directly dispute Trump's repeated insistence during the campaign that \"I have nothing to do with Russia. I don't have any jobs in Russia. I'm all over the world but we're not involved in Russia.\" 7. \"Mr. Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the 'greatest infomercial in political history.'\" No matter how Trump tries to rewrite history, it is a fact that he never, ever thought he would be the Republican nominee -- much less the president. He had walked up to the edge of running a few times before and knew that if he didn't do it this time then people wouldn't cover him when he thought about it in the future. You can dispute Cohen's assertion that Trump's entire campaign was solely to further brand awareness, but you cannot dispute that the billionaire businessman never thought he would win. 8. \"Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of 'wouldn't that be great.'\" These lines are probably the most important in all of Cohen's opening statement -- and maybe in his broader daylong testimony. Per No. 2 above, Cohen's assertion that he was in the room when Trump talked to Stone about WikiLeaks and its plans to release stolen emails runs directly counter to Trump's public insistence that he had never talked to Stone about WikiLeaks. Directly counter. The timing of all of this is very interesting too. Cohen says in his testimony that the call occurred between Stone and Trump about WikiLeaks in July 2016. Later that month, Trump held a news conference in which he said: \"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\" Either on or right around that day, according to an indictment of a number of Russian officials by Mueller, Russia sent phishing attempts to Clinton staffers. Ahem. 9. \"He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn't a 'shithole.' This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States.\" Impossible to corroborate what Cohen is saying here -- unless there were other people in the room -- but this is consistent with reporting from CNN and others in January 2018 that Trump referred to immigrants coming into the US from \"shithole\" countries. 10. \"He told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.\"  Again, virtually impossible to corroborate this. While Trump never said anything like what Cohen alleges in the 2016 campaign, his pitch to black voters was hugely stereotypical -- suggesting that they didn't have much, so why not take a chance on voting for him. \"What do you have to lose by trying something new, like Trump,\" Trump would often ask. \"What the hell do you have to lose?\" 11. \"He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did.\" This runs directly counter to Trump's insistence that he a) knew nothing about the payment to Stormy Daniels  and b) never spoke with Cohen about how to handle that situation. It is also runs counter to Trump's repeated denials that he ever engaged in extramarital acts with Daniels. 12. \"This $35,000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year -- while he was President. The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws.\" The check Cohen is referencing -- from No. 3 above -- could be damning evidence. The problem, of course, is that nowhere on the check does it say that Trump is reimbursing Cohen for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels. Which gives Trump plausible deniability. Still, it doesn't look good. At all. 13. \"I'm talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores.\" If you don't think Cohen is telling the truth here, then you have missed the entirety of Trump's professional and political life -- all of which make Cohen's claim wholly credible. 14. \"He finished the conversation with the following comment. 'You think I'm stupid, I wasn't going to Vietnam.'\" Trump received a series of deferments that kept him out of the Vietnam war. He claimed he had a medical condition -- bone spurs -- that would make him unable to serve. Two daughters of the podiatrist who diagnosed Trump with those bone spurs told The New York Times that their father did so as a \"favor\" to Trump's father, Fred. 15. \"Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not.\" NO COLLUSION! 16.  \"Don Jr. came into the room and walked behind his father's desk -- which in itself was unusual. People didn't just walk behind Mr. Trump's desk to talk to him. I recalled Don Jr. leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying: 'The meeting is all set.' I remember Mr. Trump saying, 'OK good...let me know.'\" This conversation, which Cohen said happened in early June 2016, is what he believes is a sign that President Trump knew about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Don Jr, Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and a group of Russians promising dirt on Clinton. Trump and Trump Jr. have denied that the President ever knew about the meeting. And in their defense, Cohen's memory is pure conjecture here; Don Jr. could have been talking about any number of meetings and Cohen has no proof that the President's eldest son was actually looping his father in on the meeting with the Russians. 17. \"I have never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump.\" This clears up one question I had coming into this hearing. But Cohen's statement doesn't make clear whether a pardon was ever offered -- or even floated by Trump or his allies.  18. \"I did not want to go to the White House. I was offered jobs.\" Cohen pushed back hard on the idea that Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan put forward that Cohen's willingness to attack Trump was entirely born of his anger that he had not been asked to serve in the White House. Cohen said that Trump wanted him to work in the White House but that he believed it would invalidate their attorney-client privilege and therefore make it impossible to do his other work on behalf of Trump. Donald Trump Jr. disagreed with Cohen's version of events, tweeting: \"Hahahaha Michael Cohen begged to work at the White House and everyone knows it.\" 19. \"[Stone] frequently reached out to Mr. Trump and Mr. Trump was very happy to take his calls. It was -- free service.\" This is important. Cohen made clear here that Roger Stone was not an operative of the Trump campaign but rather a sort-of friend who flitted in and out of Trump world.  There was, according to Cohen, no codified relationship between the two  -- although Cohen did say Trump was more than happy to take Stone's call and any information he offered. 20. \"Mr. Trump's desire to win would have him work with anyone.\" This was Cohen's response to Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz's question as to whether the President was capable of working with the Russians to help him win an election. This is entirely speculative, of course, but it is worth noting that Cohen did know Trump better than almost anyone for more than a decade. 21. \"Everything was done with the knowledge of, and at the direction of, Mr. Trump.\" Cohen is speaking specifically here about his allegation that he worked on Trump's behalf to make him look wealthier in order to boost him on Forbes' list of the richest people in the country. For what it's worth, Trump dropped 220 slots on Forbes' list in 2017.  22. \"It wasn't our responsibility to be the fact checker for a news agency.\" Jordan wanted to know why Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, had not denied the BuzzFeed News story last month which, citing informed sources, said that Cohen had told the special counsel's office that Trump had asked him to lie to Congress. The special counsel's office did dispute the story -- in broad terms -- although BuzzFeed did not retract it.  Earlier in his testimony (see No. 5 above) Cohen said under oath that Trump had never directly asked him to lie to Congress. 23. \"They want to know what I know about Mr. Trump ... and not one question has been asked about Mr. Trump.\" After two hours of questioning and a brief break, Cohen used a question from Jordan to lecture Republicans. Cohen noted that Republicans on the Oversight Committee had spent hours forcing him to confess wrongs he had committed, which he had already admitted, rather than asking questions about his dealings with Trump as it related to either the hush payments to Daniels and McDougal or the President's involvement in the conversations about the Trump Tower Moscow development. The two sparred several times on Wednesday. In another key moment of the hearing, Cohen said, \"shame on you, Mr. Jordan,\" when arguing that the congressman had mischaracterized his testimony. 24. \"I have no reason to believe that tape exists.\" Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland kind of, sort of asked Cohen about whether he was aware -- or had ever seen -- what has been called the \"pee tape,\" a rumored video of Trump watching prostitutes urinating at a hotel in Russia. (The allegation was made as part of a broader dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.)  According to former FBI Director James Comey, Trump brought up the tape allegation and asked him to dispute it publicly if he could. 25. \"He speaks in a code. And I understand the code because I've been around him for a decade.\" One of Cohen's core arguments in his testimony is that Trump never directly told him to, say, lie to Congress because he didn't have to: Cohen, like others who had spent years with Trump, knew exactly what Trump wanted done. Whether you believe Cohen truly understands the \"code\" that Trump is speaking in -- or whether he is actually speaking in any code at all -- depends on how you view Trump (and Cohen). Regardless, it seems clear that Trump did not expressly tell Cohen to break the law, although Cohen has clearly stated in his testimony that Trump sought to end-run campaign finance laws in paying off two women who alleged affairs with Trump in the mid-2000s. 26. \"I have never been to Prague.\" Well, that settles that. The Steele dossier alleged that Cohen traveled to Prague to meet with a Russian official during the 2016 campaign. Cohen denied he went to Prague, and said he instead went to Europe in 2016 but was in London to visit his daughter, who was studying abroad. 27. \"I don't believe Mr. Trump ever struck Mrs. Trump, ever.\" Cohen made this comment in response to questioning by Democratic California Rep. Jackie Speier about the possible existence of an elevator tape from Trump Tower in which Donald Trump is allegedly seen hitting his wife, Melania Trump. \"Comedian\" Tom Arnold has spread the idea that such an elevator tape exists, while offering no proof of that fact. Cohen said he believes no tape like that exists and that Trump was never violent with his wife. 28. \"What he didn't want was to have an entire group of thinks tanks run through his tax return ... and then he'll end up in an audit and eventually have taxable consequences.\" Asked by California Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D) what Trump had told Cohen about why he didn't want to release his tax returns, Cohen offered up this answer -- which is FAR different from the White House's official line that he cannot release the returns because he is under audit. According to Cohen, Trump was worried about being under audit if his returns were released and picked through. Which would suggest that he is not currently under audit, and that the real reason Trump is afraid of releasing his taxes is because he doesn't want to pay tax fines. 29. \"I fear that if he loses the presidential election in 2020, there will never be a peaceful transition of power.\" In Cohen's closing statement, he offered this ominous warning about what might happen if Trump loses a bid for a second term in 2020. It's not an idle threat, either. Remember that Trump has argued -- with no evidence -- that 3 to 5 million votes had been cast illegally in the 2016 election. And that was an election he won! Imagine what it would be like if he lost.","35":"Washington  (CNN)Elizabeth Warren wants contributions as small as $3 for her \"Elect-a-New-President Fund.\" Kamala Harris offered 10% Presidents' Day discounts on baseball caps, T-shirts, tote bags and other campaign swag. And on Twitter, Pete Buttigieg invoked the Democratic National Committee's new debate fundraising requirements to encourage his supporters to donate. The Democrats running for the presidency are relying on a mix of social media salesmanship and old-fashioned merchandising to scoop up what is fast becoming one of the most valuable commodities in the 2020 presidential campaign: small-dollar donors who they can tap repeatedly to fuel their primary campaigns and a general election fight likely to cost billions of dollars. As the Democratic Party's early contenders rally around a populist message that rejects big money in politics, they are scrambling to find grass-roots donations to remain competitive in a crowded field. And the party's new debate criteria have made small-dollar donors even more important: In addition to a polling requirement, candidates can also get on the debate stage by receiving contributions from at least 65,000 unique donors. To show widespread support, candidates also must demonstrate they have financial support from a minimum of 200 donors per state in at least 20 states. \"65,000 is not a low number,\" said Ken Christensen, who runs The Politics Company Inc., a political and fundraising consulting firm in Washington. \"Unless you have an organization that can be proactive on your behalf in 20 states, it can become quite difficult to meet that threshold.\" Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who announced his second presidential run on Tuesday, relied on small-dollar donors to help raise a staggering $237 million in his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination in 2016. And the power of Sanders' supporter list was on display this week. On Wednesday, his campaign said it had raised $5.9 million from 223,000 people in the first 24 hours of his candidacy, swamping the fundraising figures announced by his rivals to date. In all, a dozen Democrats already have announced presidential campaigns or exploratory committees, and several others are weighing bids. All of the major-party candidates have denounced contributions from corporate PACs, and several say they want nothing to do with super PACs, which are independent committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts to support candidates.  \"Small-dollar donors are going to be instrumental in choosing who our Democratic nominee will be,\" said Erin Hill, executive director of ActBlue, which serves as a central online fundraising platform for Democratic candidates and causes.  \"We don't have the billionaires on our side; we have the people,\" Hill said. \"Practically and pragmatically, it's the only way to have enough resources to win.\"  'Feel the Bern' for $15 The new debate rules put particular pressure on lesser-known candidates to step up their digital outreach, whether that means selling kitchen magnets or working to create viral campaign moments that draw eyeballs to politicians' Instagram feeds and Twitter accounts. Businessman and former US Rep. John Delaney of Maryland has been running for the presidency since 2017, relying on $4.5 million of his own money to fuel his long-shot campaign. And although he's crisscrossed Iowa repeatedly, only about 1% of the respondents to the CNN\/Des Moines Register\/Mediacom Iowa Poll in December named him as their first or second choices for president. Even so, Delaney's press secretary Michael Starr Hopkins said he's confident Delaney will meet the debate criteria by achieving 1% or more support in three polls. \"We are aggressively ramping up our digital fundraising, but we expect to be polling above 1%,\" Hopkins told CNN. Sanders, who appears to have jumped to an early fundraising lead, is among the candidates using swag to sell his campaign. His online store offers \"Feel the Bern\" coffee mugs ($15) and \"Medicare for all\" T-shirts (from $27). People who purchase campaign merchandise aren't really buying a product under federal rules; they are making campaign donations. Those transactions provide data valuable to candidates: email and shipping addresses and phone numbers -- allowing politicians to hit them up for more contributions and urge them to turn out to vote. \"That's worth a lot more to a campaign than the $10 you spent for the hat,\" said Michael Malbin, who runs the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute. Just as important, merchandising opens up new avenues to donors, drawing in revenue from people who may not be diehard supporters. \"A lot of people aren't 100% sold on the candidate's platform, but they want the T-shirt,\" said Bentley Hensel, who runs 1776 Consulting, a political e-commerce firm based in Louisiana.  'Chip in, any amount' Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, announced his exploratory committee earlier this month. The 37-year-old former Rhodes scholar faces an uphill battle for attention in a field crowded with better-known Democrats. But he quickly seized on the new debate rules as a fundraising opportunity. \"DNC says having >65,000 individual contributors will be a debate criterion,\" Buttigieg (pronounced boot-edge-edge) tweeted. \"Now would be a great time to chip in, any amount, to the exploratory committee!\" His campaign aides did not immediately respond to requests about how much money the pitch had raised. But it drew hundreds of retweets and scores of comments from people who said they had donated. Karen Campbell, who runs her own advertising firm in Springfield, Missouri, told CNN she had answered Buttigieg's call with a $10 contribution. Campbell said she hasn't decided which candidate she'll back in 2020 but that she's impressed by Buttigieg's intelligence. \"I want him to be on the debate stage,\" she said.","36":"Washington (CNN)An attorney who said he was speaking with President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani reassured Michael Cohen in an April 2018 email that Cohen could \"sleep well tonight\" because he had \"friends in high places,\" according to a copy of an email obtained by CNN. Two emails -- both dated April 21, 2018, and among documents provided to Congress by the President's former attorney and fixer -- do not specifically mention a pardon. Cohen, in his closed-door congressional testimony, has provided these emails in an effort to corroborate his claim that a pardon was dangled before he decided to cooperate with federal prosecutors, according to sources familiar with his testimony. But the attorney who wrote those emails, Robert Costello, told CNN that Cohen's interpretation of events is \"utter nonsense.\" Costello said that Cohen asked him to raise the issue of a pardon with Giuliani. \"Does dangled mean that he (Cohen) raised it and I mentioned it to Giuliani, and Giuliani said the President is not going to discuss pardons with anybody? If that's dangling it, that's dangling it for about 15 seconds,\" said Costello, who has a four-decade long relationship with Giuliani and was exploring potentially representing Cohen. \"The first time I kind of danced around the issue because Michael brought it up with me and I told him, 'Look, this is way too premature. ... But if you want me to bring it up, I will bring it up.' And I did.\" READ: Lawyer tells Cohen about 'back channel' with Giuliani A source with knowledge of Cohen's thinking at the time disputes Costello's version of events and insists it was Costello who was pushing his relationship with Giuliani. Another source familiar with the emails said that Trump's legal team was trying to keep Cohen in the fold as a way to keep him quiet, hinting that a pardon could be in the mix at some point. But Trump's team says it was Cohen and his lawyers who were bringing up a prospect of a pardon. The two completely contradictory narratives come as congressional committees grapple with the issue of a pardon and Cohen, specifically who initiated the pardon conversations and how far they progressed. Cohen's testimony has sparked a full-blown fight with Republicans accusing Cohen of lying when he said he \"never asked for, nor would I accept\" a pardon from Trump. Giuliani told CNN the emails Cohen provided to Congress weren't about pardons. \"That was about Michael Cohen thinking that the President was mad at him,\" Giuliani told CNN. \"I called (Costello) to reassure him that the President was not mad. It wasn't long after the raid and the President felt bad for him.\" Lanny Davis, Cohen's attorney and spokesman, told CNN that he couldn't comment on the matter if it involved documents provided to the intelligence committees. \"However, as a general matter from my own past experience, it is impossible to deny or try to spin your way out of what documents say. For example, Michael Cohen in his public testimony did not ask anyone to rely on what he was saying alone. He provided documents that speak for themselves to corroborate what he was saying,\" Davis said. In the emails obtained by CNN, Costello tells Cohen -- whom Costello says was worried about his relationship with Trump -- that all was well with Trump and that the President was still with him. \"I just spoke to Rudy Giuliani and told him I was on your team,\" Costello wrote in the first of two emails. \"He asked me to tell you that he knows how tough this is on you and your family and he will make (sure) to tell the President. He said thank you for opening this back channel of communication and asked me to keep in touch.\" In a follow-up email, Costello told Cohen he had spoken to Giuliani and told Cohen that it was \"very very positive.\" \"There was never a doubt and they are in our corner,\" Costello wrote. \"Rudy said this communication channel must be maintained. He called it crucial and noted how reassured they were that they had someone like me whom Rudy has known for so many years in this role.\" \"Sleep well tonight, you have friends in high places,\" Costello ended the email. It's not known what written response, if any, Cohen had to Costello's emails. Costello said he first started talking to Cohen after Cohen was raided by the FBI in April 2018, when Cohen was still part of the Trump joint defense agreement. Costello said he was looped in on Cohen's case by his law partner, Jeffrey Citron, who had a previous relationship with Cohen. Citron told Cohen in an email that Costello had experience both with the Southern District of New York and dealing with \"highly sensitive matters.\" No retainer was signed, according to Costello. At the time, Stephen Ryan was representing Cohen in the exhaustive review of documents seized from Cohen. One source said that Cohen was primarily concerned with a campaign finance violation at that point in the investigation. Costello said that one reason he spoke to Giuliani was because Cohen was concerned that Trump had soured on him -- or thought that he had soured on Trump -- following a New York Times report that detailed Trump's poor treatment of Cohen. The conversations occurred just days after Giuliani had joined Trump's legal team and Cohen's office and home were searched. \"He wanted to make sure that the boss or the big guy knew that he didn't hate Trump. That he wasn't blaming Trump,\" Costello said. \"There were reports out there that Trump hated Cohen, and that Cohen hated Trump... Michael couldn't say whether Trump hated him. He didn't think so. But he wanted to make sure that Trump knew that he didn't hate Trump.\" The morning after Costello's first email was sent, Trump tweeted about Cohen. \"Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if...it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!\" the President tweeted. Costello included a \"PS\" message in his follow-up email, which was sent after Trump's tweet, noting the \"very positive comments about you from the White House. Rudy noted how that followed my chat with him last night.\" Cohen testified to Congress that he spoke directly about a pardon with Trump attorney Jay Sekulow, CNN has previously reported, which Sekulow denies. But Cohen said he did not speak about pardons with Giuliani. Giuliani has previously said he never offered anyone a pardon on behalf of Trump. Following Cohen's testimony, multiple congressional committees have signaled they plan to investigate the issue of pardons. \"Congress is investigating reports that Trump and his legal team privately dangled pardons to obstruct investigations, including ours,\" House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California tweeted on Tuesday. But Cohen's testimony has also sparked a backlash from Republicans. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, on Wednesday urged Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Democratic chairman of the committee, to join his criminal referral of Cohen to the Justice Department. \"We warned the chairman when you're bringing a guy in front of Congress ... who has a history of lying and specifically lying to Congress, you run this risk,\" Jordan said last week. In a letter sent to Cummings Tuesday, Cohen attorney Michael Monico wrote that Cohen's statement \"could have been clearer\" about the time frame with pardons and when he left the joint defense agreement, but he said the statement was nevertheless still true and Cohen stood by it. Cummings said in a statement Wednesday he was satisfied with Cohen's clarification and did not intend to take any further action on the matter at this time. Costello said he had not yet heard from Congress about his conversations with Cohen -- but he expected he might soon. Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have requested the emails between Cohen and Costello, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times both reported Wednesday.","37":"London (CNN)UK Prime Minister Theresa May is braced for what could be her biggest policy climbdown yet, after insisting for years that \"no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal\" and that her country would leave the European Union on March 29, 2019.  That road map is at stake this Tuesday, when lawmakers vote for a second time on her withdrawal agreement to take Britain out of the EU. If that agreement is defeated, they will be asked the following day whether or not the UK should leave without a deal -- an option May said should be kept for negotiating purposes. And if that fails, MPs are likely to vote again Thursday on requesting a delay to Brexit from the EU. May's beleaguered deal and its widely expected parliamentary defeat goes to show that the job of untangling more than four decades of European integration is struggling to live up to the lofty promises of the 2016 referendum campaign.  The hubris and fantastical claims sold by many Brexit-supporting politicians -- and indeed some remainers -- are now facing their moment of truth as the deadline for the UK's withdrawal from the EU looms large.  As some companies jump ship, retailers stockpile products and fears of medicine shortages run high, one thing is becoming clear: The utopia that many of the 17.4 million Brexit voters dreamed of may be undeliverable.  The sunlit uplands They initially said it would be so easy. The Vote Leave campaign and its supporters claimed that negotiating with the EU would result in the \"easiest trade deal in human history.\" The vote would put the UK in \"a free trade area stretching from Iceland to Turkey,\" said prominent Brexiteer Michael Gove -- now a senior member of the government. Leaving the 28-nation bloc -- the largest free-trade area in the world -- would have \"no downsides, only considerable upsides,\" former Brexit Secretary David Davis said. The future arrangements would bring the \"exact same benefits\" as Britain had as an EU member.  These claims were repeated ad nauseam. Leaving would be \"quick and easy\" because \"the UK holds most of the cards in any negotiation,\" Conservative MP John Redwood said in 2016. Meanwhile, former London Mayor Boris Johnson and other Brexiteers assured the public that \"there will continue to be free trade, and access to the single market,\" if Britain voted to leave.  But even before the June 2016 referendum vote, the rhetoric was being picked apart. Johnson claimed -- in numerous editorials, speeches and interviews -- the weekly sum of \u00a3350 million ($456 million) paid to Europe could instead be used to finance Britain's beloved, but overstretched, National Health Service. That figure was lampooned as \"potentially misleading\" by the nation's statistical body, as it did not take into account the rebate applied before Britain pays its contributions to the EU -- or other benefits it receives. The gloomy lowlands Fast forward to 2019, and the many promises are under even more scrutiny. Estimates now suggest that the weekly cost of leaving the EU is more than double the \u00a3350 million famously emblazoned on the side of the Leave campaign's battle bus.  Bank of England economist Gertjan Vlieghe said in a February speech that Brexit had cost \u00a340 billion ($52 billion) a year since the 2016 vote -- a weekly loss of \u00a3800 million ($1 billion). Other aspects of the Brexit campaign now ring hollow, with trade minister Liam Fox possibly regretting his prediction that a trade deal with the EU would be \"one of the easiest in human history.\" Even supporters admit there will be at least short-term disruption, and claims of \"sunlit uplands\" have been replaced by assurances that Brexit \"will not be the end of the world,\" as May said last August on a trade mission to Africa.  Brexiteers campaigned on the idea they could \"take back control\" of Britain's borders and immigration controls, and \"make our own laws,\" while retaining all the economic benefits of the single market. \"Our policy is having our cake and eating it,\" as Johnson declared. Exactly how this was possible remained unclear. \"Cakeism,\" as the Brexiteer approach came to be known, failed to recognize that the European single market came with its \"four freedoms\" -- the free movement of goods, services, capital and, most importantly, people. And leaving the customs union came with major complications, namely the creating of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic that would contravene the 1998 Good Friday agreement that aimed to end decades of sectarian violence.  And what Brexiteers underestimated was the unity of European leaders during negotiations -- and how Northern Ireland, and the Conservative party's governing partner, the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland (DUP), would be a huge source of constraint.  By September 2017, Brexit Secretary Davis admitted negotiations with the EU were tougher than he'd thought. \"Nobody has ever pretended this will be easy. I have always said this negotiation will be tough, complex and at times confrontational,\" he said.  The Brexiteer response In 2018, it became clear that May's \"red lines\" of leaving both the single market and customs unions were softening toward a divorce deal that would indefinitely bind the UK closer to the EU's rules. Davis resigned as Brexit secretary that July to protest May's new customs plan.  He was followed out of the Cabinet the next day by Johnson. Johnson's resignation highlighted Brexiteer politicians' new and relaxed view of leaving the EU with no deal and trading under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules -- a scenario barely mentioned during the referendum campaign.  Leave supporters \"voted to come out,\" Johnson wrote in his weekly column for The Telegraph this January, advocating for a hard exit from the EU.  \"It is no deal, or WTO terms, that actually corresponds to their idea of coming out, and they view that option with a confidence that is now directly proportional to the growing strength of the government's warnings against it.\"  From global Britain to lonely Britain Among the many climbdowns was Britain's ability to strike free trade deals with any country of its choosing -- something it cannot do while still in the customs union.  Davis had claimed, for example, that it would take only two years for Britain to \"negotiate a free trade area massively larger than the EU.\" Not only would these \"new trade agreements ... come into force at the point of exit from the EU, but they will be fully negotiated,\" he said in a 2016 Conservative Home piece.  That year, Brexiteer Liam Fox was tasked to do just that with the newly created title of international trade secretary. He promised that \"one second after midnight in March 2019\" the UK would have 40 trade deals in the bag. But with the clock ticking toward that very midnight, local reports said he had signed post-Brexit trade agreements with six governments, among them Switzerland, the Faroe Islands, the Palestinian Authority and Chile. Culture war Immigration was the hot-button issue that drove the Brexit vote; the Office of National Statistics (ONS) ranked it British people's main preoccupation in the spring of 2016.  That view was encouraged by Vote Leave claiming that remaining in the EU would mean up to 5.23 million more immigrants coming to Britain. In the weeks before the referendum vote, Brexit-supporting politicians, including Penny Mordaunt and Michael Gove, had falsely stated that Britain would be exposed to a wave of Muslim immigration by Turkey joining the EU.   \"With the terrorism threat that we face only growing, it is hard to see how it could possibly be in our security interests to open visa-free travel to 77 million Turkish citizens and to create a border-free zone from Iraq, Iran and Syria to the English Channel,\" Gove told a Vote Leave event.  The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, a UN body, accused British politicians of fueling a sharp rise in racist hate crimes during and after the EU referendum campaign -- something right-wing newspapers and commentators continue to claim is a myth.  Gove now expresses regret and said it was wrong of the campaign to fuel immigration fears about Turkey. \"If it had been left entirely to me, the Leave campaign would have had a slightly different feel,\" he said, according to Tom Baldwin's 2018 book, \"Ctrl Alt Delete: How Politics and the Media Crashed Our Democracy.\" In 2017, May promised to slash the number of migrants to the \"tens of thousands\" and to end free movement -- the right of Europeans who live in the EU to move to other member states. However, the attempt to do so was abandoned during negotiations.   But by that point no one was listening. According to the spring 2018 ONS statistics, immigration concerns had lost their bite -- ranking below housing, cost of living, and health and social security. A tale of two sides The Remain camp was not free from miscalculations, either. When the Leave campaign won, David Cameron resigned as prime minister -- after saying he would stay on. Leave voters also say Remain predicted a \"Brexaggedon\" that has not come to pass. There is an element of truth in their claims. Former Chancellor George Osborne warned that a leave vote would lead to \"an immediate and profound shock to our economy. That shock would push our economy into a recession and lead to an increase in unemployment of around 500,000.\"  The economy did not contract and the level of unemployment is now the lowest on record. But it was only the Treasury that wrongly predicted a recession.  Other forecasters, such as the Bank of England, International Monetary Fund, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and Institute for Fiscal Studies, accurately predicted slower growth in the event of a leave vote -- in line with Britain's 2017 growth slowing to 1.7% -- making it the only country in the G7 group of wealthy nations to record a slowdown that year. By 2018, UK's economy expanded at its slowest annual rate in half a decade and the British pound is now 14% lower than before the referendum. It comes amid strident warnings that businesses would struggle or relocate after Brexit.  Not quite an apocalypse, but nor does it signal Britain is making what Boris Johnson once declared would be a \"titanic success\" with Brexit. Amid the predictions and confusion, one thing is certain -- if Brexit does go ahead, it will look nothing like the vision that the British people were originally sold.","38":"Washington (CNN)The US and Poland host a Middle East conference Thursday that's meant to address a broad range of security challenges, but looks set to be dominated by Iran, which has become a source of tension between the US and allies and is reportedly causing friction within the administration as well.  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set the tone Wednesday, declaring the gathering in Warsaw important because it gives Arab countries and Israel a chance to meet openly \"to advance the common interest of war with Iran.\" The Israeli prime minister's office later softened the statement to read \"combatting Iran,\" but there's little doubt that Tehran remains a central focus of the ministerial meeting, even with a list of agenda items that include Syria and Yemen.  Before broadening the agenda, the US initially told allies the meeting would focus on Iran, a b\u00eate noire for national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, both of whom have advocated for regime change in Tehran in the past.  Calling out Iran US Vice President Mike Pence will deliver a speech Thursday in which he \"will essentially call out Iran for their actions,\" according to administration officials who added that \"he will give a message to those groups that are there that if you stand with us, we will stand with you.\"   Outside the confines of the conference, Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, attended a Wednesday rally in Warsaw devoted to overthrowing the regime in Iran. \"There's something about peace and stability in the Middle East,\" Giuliani told the crowd, \"and that is we need to have a stable, decent Iran that is not fomenting tremendous problems.\" The ministerial is drawing representatives from more than 50 countries, according to the State Department, which listed a series of topics that could apply generally to the Middle East or very specifically to Iran.  Attendees will discuss \"regional crises and their effects on civilians in the Middle East; missile development and proliferation; cyber security and emerging threats to the energy sector; and countering extremism and illicit finance.\"  Other issues on the table include Syria, Yemen, humanitarian challenges and efforts to resolve the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.  A senior administration official, briefing reporters in Washington about the Warsaw meeting, said, \"Obviously, Iran is a key topic,\" and that discussions would center on its influence in the Middle East, \"what we can do to help get Iran on a more helpful footing\" and how to collectively push back on its malign behavior in the region.  The Trump administration says it is intent on pressuring Tehran to change its behavior in the region, not on regime change, but the aggressive US stance and Washington's decision to leave the Iran nuclear pact has frustrated European allies, creating tensions in the trans-Atlantic alliance.  Azita Raji, a former US ambassador to Sweden and current adviser to Foreign Policy for America, said, \"It is still unclear what the US expects to achieve at the Warsaw meeting. Is it to strengthen European opposition to Tehran by creating a Euro-US coalition to fight Iranian influence? Or is it about peace in the Middle East as it is now being re-billed?\" \"Either way,\" said Raji, an Obama administration appointee, \"such an ambitious agenda is doomed to fail given the lack of senior European participants, a sure sign that buy-in from our transatlantic allies is weak.\" Europeans point to Iran's compliance with the nuclear deal and are pushing back against US efforts to squeeze Tehran, setting up a special economic mechanism to allow Iran to continue trade in goods permitted under the international agreement.  Some European countries declined to send senior officials to the Warsaw conference to make the point. \"In the beginning it was about Iran, now it's disjointed,\" said one European diplomat, who pointed out that the Warsaw ministerial comes 10 days after a meeting of the 79-member coalition against ISIS, where broad Mideast issues could easily have been discussed.  A second senior administration official, briefing reporters in about the Warsaw meeting, said, \"We're not disappointed with the turnout.\"  Bolton's 'proclivity' for action Iran is also causing friction within the US government, a senior military official said. The military is seeking to avoid open conflict with Iran and rely instead on economic and diplomatic pressure, the administration's current approach.  However, some Pentagon military commanders believe Bolton is more strident and has a \"proclivity\" for action in the Gulf, the official said. In a White House video message on Monday, as Iran celebrated the 40th anniversary of its revolution against the Shah, Bolton responded to Iranian threats by telling Ayatollah Khamenei, \"I don't think you will have many more anniversaries to enjoy.\" The military official said that while Iran may possess threatening capabilities, it has been \"deliberate\" in its actions to date, carefully seeking to avoid open conflict with the US.  Vice Adm. James Malloy, the commander of US Naval Forces Central Command, told a small of group of reporters in Bahrain on Wednesday that if it wanted to, Iran is in possession of improved and dangerous weapons systems that gives it the ability to threaten to some of the world's most important waterways. \"They have a growing capability in cruise missiles, they have a growing capability in ballistic missiles, they have a growing capability in unmanned surfaced systems, all these things that we watch that are offensive, and destabilizing in nature,\" Malloy said. ","39":" (CNN)House Democrats wanted this week to be about two things: 1) the revolt against President Donald Trump by Senate Republicans over the national emergency resolution and 2) their planned vote on a package of campaign finance and ethics reforms on Friday. Instead, the week has been entirely consumed by the controversy surrounding what some Democrats took to be anti-Semitic remarks made by Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar. On Thursday, after more than 24 hours of semi-open drama about how to handle Omar's comment regarding \"the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country,\" House Democrats voted in favor of a broad measure that condemns anti-Semitism as well as Islamophobia and white nationalism. The House passed the measure, 407-23. It's a cobbled-together solution that Democrats hope puts all of this back-and-forth behind them -- even while acknowledging that they lost a week of messaging to this intra-party squabble. \"I like that. It's a gift,\" Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn told CNN's Phil Mattingly of his response to the Democratic debate over how to respond to Omar's comments. And he's right! But the episode is also revealing of a few realities of the current state of the Democratic Party -- both in Congress and nationally. Here's what it tells us: 1) It's a party caught between its past and its future. The current House Democratic freshman class represents the future of the Democratic Party: an increasingly diverse, female, liberal and younger face of a party that, for decades and decades (and like all politics), was dominated by white men and smoke-filled rooms.  And it's not only that these new members look different than how past Democratic majorities looked. It's that they act differently, too. They are more willing to say -- or tweet -- what's on their minds, whether or not it is \"politically correct\" to do so. Or if what they say will get them in trouble with their party's leadership. Omar drew the attention this week, but other freshmen like Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) have also shown a willingness to speak their minds -- even when leadership would rather they not -- in the first few months of the 116th Congress. And that has, predictably, rankled many of the older members who came up in a different political time and would like these young whippersnappers to pay their dues the same way they believe they did. 2) Being in the majority is no easy thing. The path to the House majority is paved with winning candidates from across the ideological spectrum. You can't win a majority of seats in Congress by nominating just liberal candidates. Or just conservative candidates. The way you win is to nominate candidates that effectively fit the districts in which they are running. Makes sense, right? The problem with that approach is that, if you win the majority, you are going to have members of your caucus or conference from all over the ideological map representing views that are, at times, directly at odds with established views within your party or in Washington more generally. And there is simply no easy way to either reconcile those views or get members not to express them. 3) Party leaders don't totally grasp where the party is headed. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) is, without question, one of the most astute politicians, not just currently in the House, but of all time. And yet, she seemed to underestimate the pushback she would get from Omar allies within the caucus to a resolution that targeted the Minnesota member for her comments. For Pelosi, it likely looked like a no-brainer. Omar made a comment that, when coupled with other things she has said, had the whiff of anti-Semitism. Democratic New York Rep. Eliot Engel, a prominent and long serving Jewish member of the House, was outraged and demanded action. Pelosi set the wheels in motion to do just that. But that process ran aground, forcing her to re-craft a broader anti-hate message that the whole Democratic caucus could get behind. For all the attention paid to the hostile takeover of the Republican Party by Trump over the past three-plus years, the transformation happening within the Democratic Party has been somewhat overlooked. The debate over what Omar said, what she meant and what Democrats in Congress could or should do about it shines a light on just how much the party is in flux right now. While the passage of the resolution may put this controversy to rest, there will be other disputes in the coming weeks, months and even years that will further highlight the contours of the evolution of what it means to be a Democrat in 2019.","40":"Washington (CNN)The progressive, Trump-resistant first-term Democrats in the House of Representatives -- a younger, female-dominated, and more racially diverse class -- have wielded their new powers with relish. They're pushing the party further left with ideas like the Green New Deal. They're directly challenging Washington's conventional wisdom, from foreign policy to campaign finance. And they're aggressively pursuing the Trump administration. Along the way, through committee hearings, TV appearances, and a savvy use of social media, they're building a brand for themselves.  But at the same time they're soaring, the newcomers are also stumbling. They've overreached on occasion and bumped up against resistance from the political establishment in Washington. The pattern is a familiar one for the most vocal members of a brand-new, highly motivated majority -- conservative Republicans seized their moment in similar ways when they came to power eight years earlier. But this time, female lawmakers are also making history. Among the leaders of this unofficial caucus is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the inescapable 29-year-old New York Democrat. Ocasio-Cortez's haphazard rollout of her \"Green New Deal\" environmental proposal, her viral line of questioning about campaign-finance laws, and her declaration of victory as Amazon pulls out of its plans to expand to Queens have all kept her name and her agenda at the forefront of the debate in Washington.  During her Feb. 7 appearance on the Oversight committee hearing on a relatively moderate ethics bill, Ocasio-Cortez castigated \"dark money\" and a \"fundamentally broken\" system of campaign finance. One video of her exchange shared on Twitter has received more than 38 million views, suggesting Ocasio-Cortez has captured some part of the progressive imagination. Less than two months into the new Congress, there hasn't been time for much more than that. The real test will come when Ocasio-Cortez and her freshmen peers try to pass legislation. \"Like all new members of Congress she's getting adjusted to compressing a lot of facts and feelings and ideas into just five minutes,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, told CNN last week. \"From my understanding, it was a very creative way of compressing a lot of thought and passion into a few minutes. That's always the challenge.\" There's also a learning curve. The Republican-selected witness for the hearing, former Federal Election Commission chairman Bradley A. Smith, tells CNN Ocasio-Cortez misinterpreted his public statements about campaign-finance law. \"She didn't know what she was talking about. She thought her own campaign funds were dark money. They weren't,\" Smith says. \"She didn't seem to be aware of how PACs operate, and she would have been a person who really should have been trying to learn in the hearing and she wasn't.\" Many have taken the opportunities in committee hearings to push their agendas and challenge the Trump administration through big moments designed to grab attention, go viral, and earn plaudits from like-minded liberals. They've also made themselves targets for criticism and potential headaches for their own party leadership. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota had been drawing harsh responses from both Republicans and Democrats this week over tweets implying support for Israel in Congress was driven by political donations from Jews. Democratic leadership has so far resisted calls to strip Omar of her seat on the Foreign Relations Committee, where on Wednesday she drew further attention to herself. Questioning Elliott Abrams, the State Department's newly named special envoy to Venezuela, Omar first misidentified him as \"Mr. Adams\" before reciting a series of statements about Abrams's 1991 conviction for withholding information from Congress during the Iran-Contra probe. She also questioned whether his support for anti-communist forces in Central America during his stint at the State Department during the Reagan administration meant he supported genocide committed by some of those forces. \"That is a ridiculous question,\" Abrams responded.  Others have stumbled in their bids for made-for-social-media moments. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, the 48-year-old freshman Democrat from Florida, was lost in the middle of her questioning of acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker, last week. \"Um, I have some more questions here,\" Mucarsel-Powell said as she rifled through papers, the seconds ticking down on her precious five minutes. It had been four hours since Whitaker and the committee began, not counting breaks for lunch and votes, and as a new member of the House, she came near the end of the round of questioning. \"All this time I'm waiting, and I can't find the questions,\" Mucarsel-Powell said after several seconds of awkward silence. An aide handed her a sheet of paper. \"Thank you!\" she said, relieved to have her next question finally in front of her. \"This pertains to, also, an issue that's very close and dear to my heart, LGBTQ issues.\" Mucarsel-Powell proceeded to ask Whitaker why the Department of Justice had, in 2017, rewritten a memo on sex discrimination in the workplace to exclude transgendered people from the protections of the Civil Rights Act. \"Do you stand by the department's decision to reverse its position that Title VII protects transgender people from discrimination?\" she said. Whitaker began protesting, \"Congresswoman, I think a plain reading\u2014.\" She cut him off. \"Just answer the question,\" Mucarsel-Powell said, pressing Whitaker on whether he believed members of the LGBT community should not be protected from workplace discrimination by federal law. As Whitaker hedged and reverted to explaining the DOJ's position, Mucarsel-Powell shot back, demanding a \"yes or no.\" The two went back and forth like this before the congresswoman's time expired, with dreams of a viral moment dashed. What frustrates Mia Love, the former two-term Republican congresswoman from Utah and a CNN contributor, is the sense that new members are increasingly playing to social media. \"They're making this really about them,\" Love says. \"I think they're trying to make moments go viral, to gain popularity. Love, who lost her re-election bid in November, has also been critical of Donald Trump for his divisive rhetoric. The President's own Twitter activity has contributed to a change in the norms of political discourse on social media. \"It's one thing to be loud, it's another thing to be heard,\" Love adds. Asked Thursday if new members had an \"outsized influence\" thanks to these viral moments, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said \"no.\" \"The members come, they bring their enthusiasms, their priorities, and we welcome that. They are not programmed, they are spontaneous, prepared, and I'm proud of them,\" she said. Pelosi has kind words for her new colleagues now. But their approach may eventually wear thin. Just ask John Boehner or Paul Ryan, who during their speakerships dealt with a similar dynamic from the most conservative Republicans in the conference. Grandstanding on committees and bucking leadership became standard operating procedure for a sizable wing of the last GOP majority, driving Boehner to resign and Ryan to retire from Congress before the age of 50. On Thursday, there was another hint of what might be coming Pelosi's way. Just after House Democrats had finished negotiating a spending resolution with Senate Republicans, Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, and two more freshmen Democrats, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, issued a joint statement. The new members blasted the agreement for giving more money to \"abusive agencies,\" including the Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. \"That is why we intend to vote no on this funding package,\" the four members wrote, echoing a phrase so often deployed by members of the Republican majority they have just replaced.","41":" (CNN)President Donald Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen will unleash a stunning indictment of his former client Wednesday that will amount to one of the strongest rebukes of a sitting President in living memory. Cohen will accuse Trump in a congressional hearing of being a racist and a conman in testimony that will offer a rare televised glimpse into the cloud of scandals that have haunted Trump's presidency. According to testimony released ahead of his appearance, Cohen will say Trump knew that his former political adviser Roger Stone was aware of pending releases of stolen emails intended to damage Hillary Cinton's presidential campaign. The disclosure will revive speculation that the President colluded with representatives of Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, which evolved into an effort by Moscow to help Trump win in his duel against Clinton. Cohen's allegations, if true, would amount to the first time anyone with direct knowledge of the situation has said the President had advance knowledge of the WikiLeaks dump of Clinton emails. Trump has said all along that there was \"no collusion\" between his campaign and Russia in 2016. And the President provided an early rebuttal to Cohen's testimony, tweeting from Hanoi just two hours before he is slated to meet Kim Jong Un one-on-one to kick off their second nuclear summit. \"Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately),\" Trump tweeted. \"He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying & fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time. Using Crooked's lawyer!\" Cohen's Wednesday appearance before the House Oversight Committee promises a look into the foundation of the concurrent scandals that have mostly been pursued by special counsel Robert Mueller, who has run an unusually leak-proof investigation by Washington standards. Cohen's quest for retribution has the potential to be a pivotal development in Trump's term and will certainly be the most suspenseful public moment yet in the swirl of scandals afflicting the President. RELATED: House panel to Dems: Russia off limits in Cohen's public hearing Adding to the intrigue, Trump will be watching 12 time zones away in the middle of the night in his hotel in communist Vietnam, the setting for his summit with North Korea's tyrant leader. Cohen, who served for years as Trump's legal \"fixer,\" plans to offer behind-the-scenes details of Trump's business practices and events that went on during his presidential campaign, a source told CNN's Gloria Borger on Tuesday. He may also provide documents to back up his claims, the source said, an important consideration since Trump's Republican allies will seek to impugn Cohen's credibility given that he has already pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, along with tax and fraud charges. Tuesday's hearing will likely raise a flurry of questions that will go far beyond Cohen's trustworthiness as a witness. It could test Trump's unmatched ability to slide past scandals that would doom any normal politician. And it may offer hints at the extent of the information Cohen has already given to prosecutors. The hearing could potentially also allow fresh assessments of steps, up to and possibly including an impeachment investigation, that Democrats could take against Trump in future. Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier of California believes that Cohen's life-changing decision to split with Trump and to take responsibility for his own financial crimes lends credibility to testimony that Cohen's lawyer has promised will be \"chilling.\" \"I think he's going to be pretty pure in terms of his responses, and I think there will be people who are implicated as a result of his testimony,\" Speier, who will be one of the lawmakers questioning Cohen, told CNN's Brianna Keilar on Tuesday. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders preceded Trump in launching a pre-emptive strike against Cohen, saying he should not be believed in anything he says. \"Disgraced felon Michael Cohen is going to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"Sadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same. It's laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.\" Those entrenched views could serve to limit the political impact of the revelations from Cohen. It seems unlikely, after all, that many Americans have yet to make up their minds about the President's character and personal conduct. Trump has been in the public eye for decades and has used his notoriety and lack of contrition as a political weapon. Legal threats But the deepest peril for Trump may lie in whether his former fixer implicates him in any legal transgressions before he was a politician, during his campaign or even while he was President, before the two became estranged. Trump is already facing scrutiny in a long list of civil and criminal prosecutions into his business, campaign, transition, inauguration and presidency. Cohen has already admitted to paying hush money to two women who claimed they had affairs with Trump. He said he acted at the then-Republican nominee's direction, in contravention of campaign finance laws. It is not clear whether Mueller or New York prosecutors with whom Cohen is cooperating have asked him to avoid any specific questions or issues that could influence their investigations. Sources told CNN that Cohen apologized for lying in a private hearing with the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said the formerly bombastic lawyer came across as a \"very different guy\" during his appearance. Cohen's demeanor could be crucial to his hopes of overcoming suspicions about his motives in the committee and as to whether the claims he will make about the President can be believed. Will he appear contrite and humbled in a way that will make his split with Trump and vow to clean up his own life convincing? Or will he come across as a crook seeking vengeance? His handling of cross-examination will also be important: If he snaps back at Republicans, who are sure to goad him, he could undermine his testimony. Another key question is whether Cohen will be able to provide documentary evidence about the accusations he will level against the President. Television viewers in Washington -- and Hanoi -- will also be watching to see whether he adds any dimensions to the controversies swamping Trump or opens new areas of investigation for the committee. He will surely be asked whether Trump asked him to lie to Congress before his previous congressional appearances. Such a request could theoretically rise to the level of an impeachable offense. Cohen is also expected to weigh in on whether he feels threatened by tweets and comments by the President -- who has called him a \"rat\" -- and supporters, after canceling a previous appointment to deliver witness testimony in public, saying he feared for his family's safety. On Tuesday, one Trump ally, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, tweeted: \"Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she'll remain faithful when you're in prison. She's about to learn a lot...\" Democrats will likely probe Cohen for details of hush payments made to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. He may be asked whether any other women got similar treatment. Democrats will want to know whether he was offered a pardon in return for his silence about these and other matters, as they seek evidence that the President sought to obstruct various probes into his conduct. Trump Tower project Cohen is also expected to talk about Trump's ambitions to build a luxury office and residential tower in Moscow, which court filings now show went on well into an election campaign in which the Russian government has been accused of interfering to help him win. The committee's Democratic leadership said in a statement last week that Cohen would provide details of \"potentially fraudulent or inappropriate practices by the Trump Foundation\" -- the subject of a civil lawsuit brought by the New York Attorney General's Office. The issue of Cohen's alleged travel abroad during the campaign could also intrigue Democrats seeking evidence of any meetings with Russian contacts. Republicans to blast Cohen's 'grudge' play Republicans on the committee are certain to seek to unhinge Cohen during what is expected to be a tortuously long day of testimony. In a statement last week, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, blasted Cohen as bent on avenging \"his grudge with the president\" and hoping to \"feed his insatiable desire for celebrity while being a patsy for political aims of the far left.\" Jordan, one of Trump's closest congressional allies, and his colleagues may try to turn the hearing into a circus that could obscure the impact of Cohen's claims. Democrats, led by committee Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland, therefore face pressure to deliver sharp, targeted questioning and to avoid the impression that House hearings, especially, are nothing but a partisan bear pit. Washington polarization has splintered the custom that politics should stop at the water's edge and everyone should line up behind a President when he is on critical national security business abroad. Still, the Democrats are playing hardball by not rescheduling the Cohen hearings for after Trump gets home, though given his penchant for inflammatory tweets and media skills, the notion that he will not be able to defend himself is not credible. It is unclear how Trump will react to the testimony. But CNN's Pamela Brown reported on Tuesday that aides expected him to stay up late in Hanoi to watch, and a team will be following Cohen's every word in the White House as the administration plots its counterattack. Cohen's appearance will take place hours after Trump meets Kim for the first time since their summit in Singapore last year. And it will play out ahead of the formal portion of their crucial nuclear diplomacy in Vietnam. The stagecraft of the summit and the gravity of the issues could offer Trump an opening to create a dramatic, historic gesture toward Kim that would be partly aimed at distracting attention from the spectacle back in Washington. But there is always the chance that Cohen's appearance will be so dramatic that there will be nothing the President can do to change the subject. Cohen, after all, has made it clear that he plans to damage his former client beyond repair.","42":"Washington (CNN)Senate Democrats pressed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about his financial holdings on Thursday, calling on the former financier to explain why there have been delays in certifying his required ethics disclosures. The government's chief ethics watchdog agency has yet to certify Mnuchin's 2018 financial disclosure, which was filed more than eight months ago. The delay in certification of Mnuchin's forms by the Office of Government Ethics was first reported last week by the nonprofit Center for Public Integrity. Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, asked the Treasury secretary at the Senate Finance hearing whether he had completely shed his interest in film production company, StormChaser Partners, founded by his wife, Louise Linton. \"What we have wondered is if there has been an exchange of an asset for a loan rather than a divestment,\" Wyden asked. Mnuchin responded that he has complied with rules according to certified career ethics officials inside the Treasury Department. \"I am advised by people at Treasury that I am fully in compliance and I have no ethical issues,\" Mnuchin said. The secretary declined to go into specifics about particular divestments of assets, but said that career staff at Treasury had been in ongoing discussions with OGE. \"I'm in compliance, I have been certified, and I look forward to them resolving whatever issues there are between them and OGE,\" Mnuchin told reporters following the hearing. The Treasury secretary sold his film and real estate businesses in 2017 for at least $15 million to avoid conflicts of interest. An OGE spokeswoman declined to comment when asked about Mnuchin's disclosures. The office did, however, say deadlines for certification have been extended because of the partial government shutdown earlier this year, to April 5. Trump's top finance chief is not the only member of Trump's cabinet waiting on ethics certifications. Last month, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was found to have violated his ethics agreement, while also submitting an inaccurate financial disclosure form, according to OGE. OGE Director Emory Rounds wrote at the time that Ross reported in his annual financial disclosure that he sold bank stock that other reports indicate he did not sell.   Ross asked House Democrats before testifying Thursday if he could address questions in writing about his inaccurate financial report rather than be questioned in public. The Washington Post reported earlier this week that the request was granted by the Democratic chairman of the committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings.","43":"Washington (CNN)Top Trump administration officials will privately reveal key aspects of the White House's Israeli-Palestinian peace plan during a trip to the Middle East later this month as they inch closer to a public rollout, two senior White House officials said. The top US officials will share details of the economic portion of their peace plan with several wealthy Arab countries as they look to secure financial support for the economic plan, which is designed to boost the Palestinian economy if Israelis and Palestinians reach a political settlement. Even though the officials will not address the administration's vision for a political settlement, the presentations will be the most significant to date of the administration's closely held peace plan. \"We would not be taking this trip if we were not serious about a launch in the coming months,\" said one senior White House official, who was granted anonymity to share details of the yet-unannounced trip. Senior adviser Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, the special representative for international negotiations, will offer up the details to their counterparts during a weeklong trip at the end of the month to Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, the senior White House officials said. Kushner and Greenblatt will be looking for the countries to back the concepts of the economic plan, but will not be asking for immediate financial pledges, mindful that these governments will first want to see details of the political settlement the Trump administration plans to offer, two senior White House officials said. \"They're not going to support the economic plan without making sure they also support the political plan, and we recognize that. So the support, I'm sure, will be conditioned on whether they are comfortable with the political plan,\" one senior White House official said, adding that Kushner and Greenblatt will also seek feedback from the regional leaders. White House officials said the US would also help finance an eventual economic package, but buy-in from Middle Eastern countries will be crucial as administration officials consider the economic portion to be a lynchpin of its peace proposal. \"The economic plan only works if the region supports it,\" the official said. \"We really are taking very seriously both aspects of this, the political and the economic ... We understand that if the political aspect of it is not solid, the economic aspect is meaningless. But at the same time the political aspect will not succeed without a proper economic plan.\" But the slow march toward a rollout comes even as Palestinian officials have continued to refuse any direct talks with the Trump administration. Palestinian officials cut off contact with the White House after Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017, but senior White House officials said they have consulted with other Palestinians to gauge the Palestinian perspective. Amid Palestinian officials' refusal to engage with the US-led peace process, the Trump administration moved last summer to cut off US funding to the United Nations' Palestinian relief agency. And relations between the US and the Palestinian Authority have only frayed further in recent weeks. Palestinian officials rejected US funding for its security forces late last month amid concerns that accepting the funds could leave the Palestinian Authority liable to legal claims under a new US anti-terror law, the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act. Congress and the State Department are trying to find a way around the new law's constraints. The trip to the region was initially scheduled to take place last month, but was delayed because of the partial government shutdown. Kushner and Greenblatt will also be accompanied by Brian Hook, US special representative for Iran and a senior policy adviser to the secretary of state, as well as by several administration officials involved in crafting the economic plan. The economic plan will include a combination of public- and private-sector investments designed to spur job creation in the Palestinian territories should Palestinian and Israeli officials reach a political settlement to end the conflict, the White House officials said. Trump administration officials hope the economic package will incentivize Palestinian leaders to agree to a deal. Kushner, Greenblatt and other US officials have worked to develop the peace plan over the last two years and had begun to beef up their staff last fall to prepare for a public rollout. Trump said in September he would likely unveil his administration's peace plan by the end of January. But turmoil in domestic Israeli politics forced the White House to push back its timeline as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called snap elections scheduled for April. A senior White House official said the White House would likely wait until after the elections to release its peace plan publicly. The White House's decision to share significant details of its peace plan with other countries was the surest indication yet that the White House is gearing up for a public rollout as they have so far refused to share details of the plan for fear that aspects of the plan would leak and undermine their plans. Two senior White House officials acknowledged Thursday that the presentations to foreign government officials could result in parts of the economic plan leaking to the public because it was important to get those countries on board. Trump administration officials have repeatedly pointed to shifting dynamics in the Middle East as sowing fertile ground for the release of an eventual peace plan. Israel and Sunni Muslim countries in the Middle East have quietly grown closer in recent years over a shared view of the Iranian threat, and the White House is hoping those Arab countries can encourage Palestinian leaders to accept a deal.","44":" (CNN)House Democrats on Monday unveiled an initial 2020 battlefield map, targeting 33 Republican-held or open congressional seats with an emphasis on suburban districts -- and Texas in particular. The target list was released in a strategy memo from Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and DCCC executive director Allison Jaslow, who announced that the committee \"is gearing up for an aggressive effort to fortify and expand\" the majority won by House Democrats in 2018.  \"As the saying goes, the best defense is a good offense, and we couldn't agree more,\" they wrote. \"2018 was just the tip of the iceberg for Democrats,\" said Bustos. \"Today we are announcing our plan to go on offense and grow our New Democratic Majority. We have a clear path to expanding our Democratic Majority, and by putting our plans in motion earlier in the cycle than ever before, we are demonstrating to Democrats across the country that the political arm of House Democrats is operating in high gear from the start. Looking to build on their success targeting such seats in the recent midterms, the Democrats said that \"many of the districts on our list have big suburban populations; many have also experienced rapid population growth in recent years -- particularly in diverse communities\" and described the districts as \"ripe pick-up opportunities.\"  That's reflected in the committee's focus on Texas, the state most heavily represented on the target list. The DCCC is targeting six Texas seats: the 10th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th and 31st districts located in suburbs outside San Antonio, Houston, Dallas and Austin.  The party scored a couple of key wins in Texas in 2018: Rep. Colin Allred defeated veteran Republican Rep. Pete Sessions in the Dallas-area 32nd district and Rep. Lizzie Fletcher similarly toppled Republican John Culberson in the 7th district near Houston. A DCCC aide noted that the districts on the 2020 target list have trended Democratic in recent cycles and share characteristics like high population density as well as high or growing levels of education and diversity -- key demographic factors for the party. And these trends \"aren't exclusive to Texas,\" per the memo, as the committee plans to target suburban districts near cities like Phoenix (Arizona's 6th), Atlanta (Georgia's 7th), Indianapolis (Indiana's 5th), St. Louis (Missouri's 2nd), and Charlotte (North Carolina's 9th). Democrats will confront a Republican electorate in 2020 that's likely to be more energized by a presidential contest than they were in the recent midterms. In their strategy memo, however, the DCCC argued that President Donald Trump is \"dragging his enablers in Congress down with him,\" and that \"presidential battleground states like Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania are shaping up to be treacherous terrain for House Republicans.\" Many of the districts have been top Democratic targets in recent cycles, including some near misses in the midterms, like in Illinois'13th (2018 margin under 1%), Kentucky's 6th (under 4%), Minnesota's 1st (under 1%), Nebraska's 2nd (under 2%), and Pennsylvania's 10th (under 3%). All were on the committee's 2018 \"Red to Blue\" list. In total, the party identified 26 districts where Republicans won by 5 points or fewer in 2018. The DCCC strategy memo pointed to retirements, a key factor in the 2018 midterms, as another significant 2020 variable. The committee highlighted that 20 of the 33 seats on the 2020 target list are held by incumbent Republicans who have never served in the minority, while noting the retirement of Rep. Tom Marino in Pennsylvania's 12th district less than a month into his term. Rep. Fred Upton in Michigan's 6th district and Rep. Peter King in New York's 2nd district are \"at the top of the retirement watch list,\" the DCCC wrote.  A number of high-profile Republican representatives were also on the target list: California Rep. Devin Nunes (22nd district), the controversial former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee; Iowa Rep. Steve King (4th district), whose recent comments defending \"white supremacy\" earned him the condemnation of his own party; and Reps. Chris Collins (New York's 27th) and Duncan Hunter (California's 50th), who won close 2018 contests in deep red districts despite being indicted on ethics and campaign finance violations, respectively, amid their reelection campaigns. The 9th district in North Carolina, where 2018 results still haven't been certified amid litigation over allegations of election fraud by a Republican operative, is also on the list.  Pointing to corruption and health care as \"key motivating factors for voters in 2018,\" the committee previewed similar messaging themes for the party in 2020. The memo touted House Democrats' package of campaign finance and ethics reforms, and described the House majority as \"the single check on the Trump Administration's lawsuit to gut the Affordable Care Act.\" \"If 2018 was the new 2006, then we're already on course for 2020 to shape up as the new 2008, where Democrats expanded the House majority they had just won,\" Bustos said. \"Similar to the 2008 cycle, Democrats go into 2020 with a House Majority and a battlefield with a clear path taking shape to win more seats.\" Here's the full list of targeted districts: AZ-06 -- Dave SchweikertCA-22 -- Devin NunesCA-50 -- Duncan HunterCO-03 -- Scott TiptonFL-15 -- Ross SpanoFL-18 -- Brian MastGA-07 -- Rob WoodallIA-04 -- Steve KingIL-13 -- Rodney DavisIN-05 - Susan BrooksKY-06 -- Andy BarrMI-06 -- Fred UptonMN-01 -- Jim HagedornMO-02 -- Ann WagnerNC-02 -- George HoldingNC-09 -- OPENNC-13 - Ted BuddNE-02 -- Don BaconNY-01 -- Lee ZeldinNY-02 -- Peter KingNY-24 -- John KatkoNY-27 -- Chris CollinsOH-01 -- Steve ChabotPA-01 -- Brian FitzpatrickPA-10 -- Scott PerryPA-16 - Mike KellyTX-10 -- Mike McCaulTX-21 -- Chip RoyTX-22 -- Pete OlsonTX-23 -- Will HurdTX-24 -- Kenny MarchantTX-31 -- John CarterWA-03 -- Jaime Herrera Beutler","45":"Washington (CNN)One week after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, Imaad Zuberi, an American venture capitalist and longtime Democratic donor, began piling tens of thousands of dollars into Republican coffers.  It was a dramatic shift for Zuberi, who embraced Democrats as his entr\u00e9e into Washington, serving as a major donor on fundraising committees for Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. To gain access to the incoming regime, Zuberi made a $900,000 donation to Trump's inaugural committee through his company Avenue Ventures LLC.  That donation has now entangled Zuberi in a criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan who have launched a wide-ranging probe into the finances around the inauguration.  On Monday, prosecutors with the US attorney's office in Manhattan subpoenaed the inaugural committee for any documents and communications it had with Zuberi and his company. He was the only individual singled out in the subpoena, which also sought the identities of all donors, benefits they received, communications about donations from foreign nationals, and payments to vendors.   It isn't clear why Zuberi is on the prosecutors' radar. He's a big political player, investor and consultant to foreign governments. During the transition and beyond, he spoke briefly with Trump's then-personal attorney Michael Cohen, took a selfie photograph at Trump Tower with Michael Flynn, who later briefly served as Trump's national security adviser, and reportedly had contact at least twice with the President.  Zuberi has not been contacted by special counsel Robert Mueller's office or federal prosecutors, according to his spokesman Steve Rabinowitz. \"Imaad knows nothing about a subpoena, other than what's been written. It's well known that after supporting President Obama and Hillary Clinton, that Imaad gave generously and directly to the Trump inaugural.  But many others gave considerably more.  For what it's worth, Imaad, as always, gave only his own money from his own resources. If, in fact, he is named in this subpoena -- never mind somehow named alone -- he is bewildered why,\" Rabinowitz said. Access to Trump and his world After Trump's election, Zuberi continued donating to a wide swath of candidates from both political parties but he began piling more money to the Republican party, according to records from the Federal Election Commission. He and his company gave to Trump's re-election fund, the Republican National Committee, campaign funds for House and Senate Republicans and a long list of Trump-friendly candidates across the country.  Zuberi's donation opened the doors to access to the President and his inner circle. He attended an exclusive formal dinner before the inauguration with members of the foreign diplomatic corps where he was photographed with Trump, according to The New York Times. His donation went through GOP fundraiser Caroline Wren, according to a person familiar with the donation. Wren did not respond to a request for comment.  Zuberi's turn toward Republicans continued to give him audiences with the President well past the inauguration. In addition to the inauguration dinner, Zuberi was part of a small private gathering of donors with Trump in October 2017 at a fundraiser for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, according to The Post and Courier, a newspaper in Charleston, South Carolina.  The intimate event brought together about 30 people, mostly donors, and included Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.  It wasn't just the President with whom Zuberi had increased access in the wake of his donations. In 2016 and 2017 Zuberi crossed paths with Cohen, Trump's now-former personal attorney, and had three brief conversations, lasting between two and 10 minutes, according to Rabinowitz. At that time, CNN has reported, Cohen aggressively pitched himself to prominent companies and business leaders as someone who could broker access to Trump and influence the nascent administration.  Cohen has provided more than 70 hours of cooperation with federal prosecutors, according to a source with knowledge of the discussions, and The New York Times has reported the inaugural investigation has stemmed from the investigation into campaign finance violations by Cohen.   Zuberi spoke with Cohen and others about the inauguration, Rabinowitz said, seeking advice about which events to attend. He added that Zuberi did not donate through Cohen. In one conversation, Cohen asked Zuberi to be involved in a Manhattan real estate project, but the discussion never went any further than a brief conversation, the spokesman said.   Foreign ties and a Trump Tower selfie Zuberi's foreign consulting work has attracted some controversy. Zuberi had a consulting agreement in 2014 on behalf of Sri Lanka, according to records. Foreign Policy reported that the public affairs companies his firm hired were all subpoenaed by the Department of Justice but said none of them were targets of the investigation.  A California-based company had listed Zuberi as a \"consultant\" for this work in federal filings in 2014. But weeks after the Foreign Policy story was published, Zuberi himself registered with the Justice Department and reported his work for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, according to a federal database maintained under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. These same laws have entangled other players in Trump's orbit.  Zuberi graduated from the University of Southern California and worked mostly in finance early in his career at TransAmerica and Aegon Group, venturing into private investments and serving on the boards of a few startup companies. He speaks several languages, including Hindi, Mandarin, Arabic and English.  One area Zuberi had done business is in Qatar, where he owns rental properties, his spokesman said. Zuberi met with Qatari officials in New York in December 2016 and accompanied them as they walked to a separate meeting at Trump Tower. Zuberi rode the elevator with the officials but he did not attend the meeting and has no idea then or now who the Qatari officials met with or what the meeting was about, according to the spokesman. In the elevator, he saw Flynn and took a selfie with him and later posted it on his Facebook page.  A spokesman for Ahmed Al-Rumaihi, the then-head of the QIA, previously told CNN, \"Mr. Al-Rumaihi was at Trump Tower on December 12, 2016. He was there in his then role as head of Qatar Investments, an internal division of QIA, to accompany the Qatari delegation that was meeting with Trump transition officials on that date.\"  Photos surfaced of Al-Rumaihi in the building around the same time as Flynn and Cohen. Al-Rumaihi's spokesman said he did not meet with Flynn. The Washington Post reported that Cohen sought a $1 million contract with Qatar in exchange for access to the incoming administration on the heels of the meeting.  Qatar's media attach\u00e9 in Washington, Jassim Al-Thani, explained later in a statement that the meetings with the incoming administration in December 2016 were to discuss \"many critical areas, including: regional security, military cooperation, counterterrorism, and economic partnership.\" He said Al-Rumaihi \"was present at Trump Tower but did not participate in any meetings\" with the government delegation.","46":"In this new weekly column \"Cross-exam,\" Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, gives his take on the latest legal news and answers questions from readers. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on \"CNN Newsroom\" at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. If the reporting is accurate, Trump's actions make his intent clear: Get my hand-picked appointee -- Trump personally interviewed Berman before he was appointed to run the Southern District of New York -- back on the Cohen case to limit the damage done to me. I've charged and tried obstruction of justice cases. If this isn't an attempt to obstruct, then I don't know what is.  Trump has offered only the weakest of defenses: The conversation with Whitaker didn't happen, and the report is \"fake news.\" (Note the pause in this video before Trump answers; prosecutors or poker players might call this a \"tell.)  That defense collapses under scrutiny. First, Whitaker has essentially admitted he did speak with Trump about the Southern District of New York case. Under questioning in Congress -- stemming from CNN's exclusive reporting that Trump discussed that investigation with Whitaker -- Whitaker forcefully denied he had spoken to Trump about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation but bobbed, weaved and ultimately declined to answer when asked if he and Trump had discussed the Southern District of New York case.  Common sense: When a witness strongly denies he discussed one thing but dodges on the other, that means he discussed the other thing. Also, Trump happens to have done the exact same thing he reportedly tried to do to Berman -- convince him to un-recuse and take charge of a criminal matter to limit potential damage to Trump -- to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Trump repeatedly and publicly berated Sessions, calling him \"scared stiff and Missing in Action,\" retweeting a commentator who referred to Sessions' recusal as \"an unforced betrayal,\" and declaring that Sessions should un-recuse and \"stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now.\" Trump tried to bully Sessions into getting back into the Russia case to limit damage done to Trump; is it any wonder Trump tried to do the exact same thing to the Southern District of New York?  Now, your questions Sandra, Massachusetts: Can Congress subpoena Mueller to testify as to the report and to any interference his office has experienced -- particularly if new Attorney General William Barr refuses to make the full report public? Many readers suggested this as a possible recourse if some or all of the Mueller report is kept out of public view. Yes, Congress -- almost certainly the Democratic-controlled House -- could subpoena Mueller and ask what he learned during the investigation. However, Mueller would face limits on what he could talk about publicly. He cannot disclose classified or sensitive national security materials.   Prosecutors also are prohibited from publicly discussing grand jury material, meaning information or testimony obtained through a subpoena. However, there are ways around this prohibition; former Bill Clinton independent counsel Kenneth Starr obtained court permission to disclose grand jury materials, for example. And Trump might assert executive privilege to block Mueller from testifying about Trump's discussions with his advisers. Though, as discussed below, I doubt Trump would prevail legally.  So, while Mueller's live testimony would be limited in some respects, it remains an important fail-safe if Trump or Barr quashes the special counsel's written report altogether. And the pure drama of Mueller taking the stand in Congress would be unparalleled.     Andrea, New York: What will happen to the Mueller probe and all the new congressional investigations if Trump invokes executive privilege? Executive privilege is not a \"get out of jail free\" card. It does, however, enable the President and perhaps others to avoid answering questions or producing evidence in response to a subpoena. The idea is that the president should be able to speak freely and confidentially with his advisers without worrying about those discussions ever becoming public -- as with other legal privileges between attorney and client or doctor and patient. I expect executive privilege could still become a flashpoint in the Russia investigation. Trump and his team already have suggested he might invoke executive privilege to avoid answering direct questions from Mueller, to resist congressional subpoenas and to redact portions of Mueller's written report.   The issue could end up before the Supreme Court, as it did in 1974 in United States v. Nixon. The court unanimously ruled against President Richard Nixon, who argued that executive privilege protected him from having to turn over White House tapes to the Watergate special prosecutor. The court held that executive privilege protects national security and military secrets but does not provide a generalized shield in criminal matters. Given the Nixon precedent, I think Trump will fail if he tries to exert executive privilege for anything other than sensitive national security communications.   While the Nixon decision arose from a dispute over a grand jury subpoena, the precedent likely would also apply to congressional testimony. Mueller's probe may be ending, but as congressional inquiries continue, executive privilege is likely to an ongoing issue. Michael, Missouri: I'm not a lawyer, but can Roger Stone get away with just apologizing?   In 14 years as a prosecutor, I saw defendants do reckless things while released on bail awaiting trial. But I've never seen a defendant do anything quite as blatant as Stone publicly posting on social media a photo of Judge Amy Berman Jackson with rifle cross hairs next to her head and accusing the judge of presiding over a \"show trial.\" In other words, I doubt he will be able to get away with it. Stone committed new federal crimes by threatening the judge and obstructing justice. Stone might argue he did not intend the post as a threat -- his mealy-mouthed, heavily lawyered, passive-voiced \"Notice of Apology\" lamely makes that argument -- but any rational person sees an image of cross hairs as a threat.   Apparently, Jackson does, too; she has summoned Stone to court to consider whether to revoke his bail based on a violation of bail conditions (which include a prohibition on committing new crimes) or to broaden the gag order that Jackson issued Friday. Stone grew up in a political underworld where you can slide by with cheap shots and flimsy denials. But the criminal courts are different; accountability is enforced. Stone's dangerous actions pose a threat to the judge, the justice system and his own liberty. John, Tennessee: Since Paul Manafort is being prosecuted and sentenced to prison for lying to the FBI, isn't Andrew McCabe subject to the same since he has been found to have lied to the FBI as well? In a February 2018 report, the Department of Justice inspector general found that former acting FBI Director McCabe \"lacked candor\" in responding to questioning about his involvement in anonymous leaks to the media; those leaks rebutted an incorrect narrative that McCabe had terminated an investigation of Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. In March 2018, Sessions, then attorney general, fired McCabe, based on the inspector general's findings. McCabe might be charged with federal crimes, including false statements and obstruction of justice. McCabe has claimed publicly that he did not intentionally lie but rather was confused by investigators' questioning and distracted by other events swirling around the FBI.   I find that defense hard to believe. The inspector general found that McCabe \"lacked candor\" not once -- when maybe he had a bad day or was out of sorts -- but three separate times on three separate dates, all while under oath. McCabe's statements were straightforward -- he falsely denied authorizing or being the source of leaks to the media about a recent and exceptionally high-profile case. That's not the kind of thing one forgets or misremembers or misstates.   Ultimately, a prosecutor will weigh all the facts and determine if a criminal prosecution of McCabe is appropriate and warranted. Mueller is not handling the McCabe investigation, but he has indicted Manafort, Stone, Michael Flynn, Cohen, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos for allegedly making false statements to federal investigators or Congress. McCabe, too, lied to federal investigators (repeatedly), and it is hard to see a meaningful distinction between his case and the ones Mueller has charged. Joe, Massachusetts: What is the rationale for the Department of Justice counseling against indicting a sitting president for a crime? I thought that no American was above the law. The primary rationale for the Justice Department's current policy against indicting a sitting president is that it could effectively cripple the executive branch: \"To wound (the President) by a criminal proceeding is to hamstring the operation of the whole governmental apparatus, both in foreign and domestic affairs.\" The department's policy also considers the possibility of indicting the president while in office and delaying trial until his term ends, but concludes that \"an indictment hanging over the President while he remains in office would damage the institution of the Presidency virtually to the same extent as an actual conviction.\" For those who worry that Justice Department policy places a sitting president above the law, remember two things. First, a president can be impeached, removed from office and potentially indicted or indicted after the natural end of his term (subject to statute of limitations). Second, the department's policy acknowledges that there is no clear answer in the Constitution --  \"neither the text nor the history of the Constitution ultimately provided dispositive guidance\" -- and there is healthy disagreement among scholars about the issue.     Molly, Georgia: In a tweet, Trump called the 25th Amendment \"unconstitutional.\" Is it even possible for part of the Constitution to be unconstitutional? Trump, quoting Alan Dershowitz, tweeted that trying \"to use the 25th Amendment to try and circumvent the Election is a despicable act of unconstitutional power grabbing.\" By definition, something that is part of the Constitution cannot be unconstitutional.   However, I think Trump meant that it would have been an abuse of the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. I agree with that. The 25th Amendment applies not to a president who acts badly or rashly or irresponsibly, but rather to a president who is \"unable to discharge the duties of his office.\" The amendment passed in 1967, after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, when concerns ran high about contingency plans if a president was grievously wounded and incapacitated.    McCabe and others at the FBI might have genuinely believed Trump was compromised by his potential ties to Russia. The proper constitutional remedy, however, would not be removal through the 25th Amendment but rather investigation and, if warranted, impeachment.  McCabe and the FBI acted appropriately and wisely when they initiated counterintelligence and obstruction of justice investigations of Trump in 2017; those investigations were, and remain, necessary to determine the full extent of Trump's relationship with Russia.  Our Constitution provides various mechanisms to hold a president accountable, and here I think that an investigation and potential impeachment (depending on the findings) are a better fit than the 25th Amendment.  Bethany, Georgia: There is so little talk of the immunity granted to Allen Weisselberg, Trump's longtime chief financial officer. Do you believe Weisselberg's cooperation has led to the recent subpoenas to the Trump inaugural committee and interview requests with the Trump Organization? We haven't heard much about Weisselberg since he received immunity from the Southern District of New York, but don't sleep on him.  The Southern District immunized Weisselberg -- meaning essentially it agreed not to charge him if he provided full and truthful testimony -- in relation to hush money payments to two women, potentially in violation of campaign finance laws. After Weisselberg entered the immunity deal with the Southern District of New York, Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations relating to those payments. The Cohen charging papers also detail the involvement of Trump Organization \"Executive-1\" and \"Executive-2,\" both of whom eventually could face campaign finance charges.  More broadly, Weisselberg kept the books for Trump for decades and reportedly \"knows where all the financial bodies are buried.\" If Weisselberg continues to cooperate, he could give the Southern District of New York a guided tour of decades' worth of financial and potentially other malfeasance by the Trump Organization.  3 questions for the next week: 1)  Will Mueller send his report to Barr next week, as reportedly expected, and what will Barr do with it from there? 2)  Will Sen. Lindsey Graham follow through on his vow to hold hearings on the FBI's consideration of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump? And, if so, what more will we learn about the early days of the Russia investigation? 3)  When Cohen testifies publicly in the House Intelligence Committee next Wednesday, what will the committee and public learn?","47":"Cohen is testifying before three congressional committees this week.

The 21-year-old, who had just earned an associate's degree at her local community college, signed up for four classes in her quest to earn a bachelor's degree in psychology. But the partial government shutdown threw a wrench in those plans. With the Internal Revenue Service closed, Monahan wasn't able to retrieve tax documents she needed for financial aid in time and was forced to drop three classes -- and even then she had to borrow money from family to pay the first installment of $270 on the single class she kept.  \"I'd like to earn my bachelor's as quickly as possible so I can begin to work full time as a certified teacher and continue on to a master's program,\" said Monahan, who eventually got her aid and now plans to take summer classes to catch up. \"I do not want to postpone a semester but because of the shutdown, I have very little other options.\"   President Donald Trump signed a bill ending the shutdown Friday. Top Trump administration officials had suggested that the effects of the shutdown will evaporate as soon as the government reopens. \"The moment, the nanosecond the government is ... reopened all these glitches will go away,\" National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Thursday.  But the experience of students like Monahan shows that's not true. The 35-day closure wreaked havoc not just on furloughed workers and contractors, but on the millions of Americans who depend on the government to provide crucial services or information. College students ran into trouble because the IRS tool to get tax transcripts was down until last week. Many students needed these transcripts to receive their financial aid for the spring semester, and it was \"causing a lot of problems,\" said Megan Coval, vice president for policy and federal relations at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.  The agency's website said the tool was down for maintenance, but students were unable to get help on the phone or at IRS offices because the workers had been furloughed. The IRS did not return a request for comment. Take Taylor and Aubry Evans, who moved from California to Canada a few weeks ago to continue their higher education at a more prestigious college. The 21-year-old twins realized they needed additional tax documents when they arrived on campus in early January. While Taylor Evans was recently able to obtain her tax transcript, their father still hasn't been able to, blocking them from completing their paperwork. They are trying to reach the IRS, but they can't get through because the call volume is too high. Without aid, they cannot pay their tuition -- due January 31 -- or their February rent. If the funds don't arrive in the next few days, they will have to return to San Diego -- but they'll still be on the hook for tuition since the deadline to drop classes has already passed. \"We had it budgeted perfectly,\" Taylor Evans said, noting the sisters don't feel they can count on the aid coming through. \"If it's not resolved, we're going to go home.\" The delays prompted some schools -- such as York Technical College in Rock Hill, South Carolina -- to require students to set up payment plans in order to remain registered for the semester, said Justin Pichey, associate director of financial aid at York, which has roughly 7,000 students. That's what Kat Lucena had to do. A freshman double majoring in arts and finance at Technical College of the LowCountry in South Carolina, Lucena requested her tax transcript soon after the IRS tool became operational last week. But her aid has not yet come through, so she was forced to set up a plan and put the first $500 tuition payment on her credit card. Lucena, 23, already works full time at a print shop to cover her other bills. She won't be able to pay off the tuition in full so she'll incur interest and late fees -- at least until her aid is finalized, she said. \"It's adding more stress than I need,\" said Lucena, of Bluffton, S.C. \"I'd rather focus just on my studies.\"","49":"Washington  (CNN)Fred Malek, the former president of the Marriott hotel chain and one of the Republican Party's most influential fundraisers, has died, his office confirmed Monday. Malek died Sunday at age 82. A cause of death was not immediately available. Malek underwent treatment for bladder cancer about five years ago.  Malek was one of the most enduring figures in Republican politics and his prodigious fundraising on behalf of GOP candidates put him at the center of presidential politics for more than four decades.  He worked for Richard Nixon's administration, ran the 1988 Republican National Convention in the run-up to George H.W. Bush's election and managed Bush's unsuccessful re-election campaign in 1992. He later served as finance chairman of Arizona Sen. John McCain's failed 2008 presidential bid.  Malek also was a top fundraiser for the Republican Governors Association and helped found the American Action Network,  a political nonprofit that pushed conservative policy. Although he did not engage in President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, Trump in 2017 appointed him to chair the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Over his long career in politics, Malek also faced recurring criticism for his role in compiling a list of Jews working at the Bureau of Labor Statistics at Nixon's request -- something for which he apologized repeatedly over the years. \"I made a mistake 41 years ago for which I apologized,\" Malek told USA Today during a 2012 interview at the Republican National Convention. \"It's something I regret.\"  At the time, former Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota, who is Jewish and co-founded the American Action Network with Malek, told the paper that anti-Semitism \"is not even in (Malek's) universe.\" On Monday, Coleman praised Malek as a \"fearless warrior in life and in politics.\"  \"Fred never walked away from a fight that needed to be fought,\" Coleman said. In a statement, Nixon's daughters, Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower, called Malek a \"giant.\" \"He rose from the humblest of beginnings to serve as a dedicated public servant and counselor to presidents and a decisive, inspirational leader in business, real estate and hotel management,\" they said. Frederic Malek grew up in the Chicago area, the son of a beer delivery truck driver. He attended West Point and became an Army Ranger. He graduated from Harvard's business school in 1964.  His business career spanned several fields. In addition to his role at Marriott, he served as Northwest Airlines' chief executive and even dabbled in sports as a co-owner -- with George W. Bush and other investors -- of the Texas Rangers baseball team. His most recent venture -- Thayer Lodging Group, named for an early superintendent of West Point -- invested in hotel real estate. Malek donated to and raised millions for his favorite causes, including West Point and the Richard Nixon Foundation. The visitors' center at West Point bears his name.

So far, that exchange (during a hearing on House Democrats' sweeping democracy reform bill) has garnered an astounding 38 million views. It's not hard to see why. But what the viral video leaves out is that the reform bill includes a solution to curb the power of big money in politics: a voluntary public financing system for congressional races. Here's how it would work. Small contributions would receive public matching funds, at a ratio of 6-to-1. If you give a candidate $100, for example, that becomes $700. Participating candidates would agree to curb the size of contributions they receive. They could now fund their races by amassing small contributions, rather than those from big donors and special interests. This shift could transform politics and policymaking. Voters long have seethed over big money's role. But the US Supreme Court has made matters far worse.  Thanks to Citizens United and other rulings, billionaires (sorry, \"people of means\" ... well lots of means) now can fund campaigns effectively without limit, and without public disclosure. A big donor system tilts policymaking. Just one recent example: According to the Center for Public Integrity, a small group of wealthy donors suddenly poured funds into Republican campaigns and political committees as the tax cut bill was being shaped. Incumbents must spend hours a day raising funds, trooping to call centers near the Capitol that resemble nothing less than the skeezy boiler room in \"Sorry to Bother You.\" Public financing has long been understood to offer a better way to fund campaigns. Theodore Roosevelt first proposed it in his 1907 State of the Union. It was enacted for presidential campaigns in 1974 when the Watergate scandal revealed tales such as the Cabinet official who had to handle a briefcase crammed with $200,000 in cash from a donor. The system worked well enough for several decades. Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush participated. In fact, in the first five elections presidential public financing was used, three challengers unseated incumbents, a far more competitive record than nearly any congressional district. Eventually that system fell, mostly because it simply did not provide enough money.    The issue of campaign finance receded. Sure, big money mattered, but what could anyone do about it? That notion was exploded in the 2018 election. Nearly 120 House challengers shunned corporate PAC money and vowed reform. Forty or so now serve in the freshman class, part of the most diverse Congress in history. That's a bloc as big as the \"Watergate Babies\" elected in 1974 who pushed House changes. This new version of reform reflects the realities of today's digital politics.  A small donor system doesn't try to end all private money in politics, a futile goal sought by earlier plans. Rather, it aims to bolster one of the most encouraging trends in political life. In 2018, individuals giving less than $200 gave $381 million to general election federal candidates.    The federal proposal is based on a successful approach used in New York City for three decades. The city's matching fund system is considered the country's best set of campaign rules. The vast majority of candidates from both parties participate. It's led to a far more diverse set of officeholders and has helped ensure that several candidates compete for each seat with enough funds. Above all it has helped curb corruption. Some smaller incidents notwithstanding, compared with recent decades, New York politicians are seldom brought down by campaign finance-related scandals or prosecutions. Because it aims to amplify rather than squelch speech, the general constitutionality of public financing has been reaffirmed by the US Supreme Court, even in the current deregulatory era.  Today the loudest attacks come from Republicans. Why, they worry, help Democrats raise small funds? But other years, Republicans have benefited more. As Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows noted, he might receive millions in public funding. That's a feature, not a bug in the proposal. It would incentivize lawmakers of both parties to turn to grassroots fundraising. Critics also warn against wasting taxpayer money on politics. The plan would cost taxpayers about $1 each but would save far more by avoiding unjustified tax and regulatory policies.   Many Democrats whisper opposition, too, when caucus doors close. They don't want to bite the hand that funds them. They worry that voters might punish a plan that uses taxpayer money for politics. Since incumbents typically outraise challengers, they want to be able to build a cash wall to protect their seats. They would ignore the rumblings of public discontent at their peril. Today voters are enthusiastic about reform. If Democrats flinch, it will be public anger that goes viral.  An earlier version of this article incorrectly described an aspect of the voluntary public financing system. The size of contributions, not the amount of candidate spending, would be limited.","51":"Washington (CNN)On the evening Robert Mueller submitted his report to the Justice Department, ending the special counsel investigation that has clouded all but a few months of his presidency, President Donald Trump was not huddled in a war room or dictating defiant tweets to his underlings. Instead he was on the tiled patio of Mar-a-Lago, bathed in golden light, with his wife and son Barron, who had reached teenagerhood two days earlier. In the eyes of the President and his aides, many of whom traveled to South Florida for the weekend, it was a moment to celebrate: the conclusion of an investigation that did not find enough evidence to indict the President or his confidants for conspiring with Russia to win the 2016 election.  Whether the end of Mueller's probe means the end of Trump's long legal albatross, or just the beginning, is largely a matter for Congress and the various other prosecutors who have taken on ancillary investigations.  Even as Mueller's team vacates the bland Washington office building where he's been working every day since May 2017, another struggle is beginning, opening a new chapter Trump will try to control but which he will write only part of the script. Still, Trump and his allies are already signaling the report is an unequivocal victory, once that exonerates the President from the various misdeeds -- collusion, obstruction -- that his opponents have used as bywords for what they regard as a shambolic presidency. While there was not a strict plan in place ahead of the report's conclusion, Trump and his Republican allies immediately launched an effort to cast the document as absolving him of wrongdoing.  Talking points distributed by the Republican National Committee encouraged Trump's allies to stress that \"after two years, millions of taxpayer dollars, and multiple congressional investigations confirming there was no collusion, it's good this report has finally concluded.\" It's done News the investigation had ended became official on Friday around 5 p.m. ET, as Trump was discussing trade and Brexit in a businesslike phone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at his Florida club. Earlier, Emmet Flood -- the White House lawyer tasked with overseeing matters related to the Russia probe -- received a phone call from an aide to Attorney General William Barr telling him the report had been delivered to the Justice Department. Flood, who almost never travels with the President, had decided to accompany him to Palm Beach this weekend, anticipating what all of Washington seemed to know: that Mueller was nearing the end of his investigation. He helped comprise a larger-than-usual coterie of aides who descended on the President's Italianate club.  In the early evening, many of them were seen milling about the main floor of the estate, all waiting to learn what might be contained in Mueller's report. In the days and weeks leading up to the report, there were few planning sessions to prepare for the document, according to people familiar with the matter. While vague plans for statements and reaction were laid, West Wing staffers said there was little to indicate how the White House would respond once the investigation concluded, and a source close to the President told CNN Saturday the White House does not have a war room set up in anticipation of the report's release, unlike the Clinton administration ahead of the release of former independent counsel Ken Starr's report. \"I have no idea about the Mueller report,\" Trump told reporters on Friday morning as he headed to Florida, insisting he would be keeping busy at his resort between a meeting with Caribbean leaders and various other sessions on trade. Trump himself was kept updated by his team of lawyers, whom he quizzed periodically about the status of the report over the last several weeks. Trump himself had grown impatient with the waiting game, aides said, which dominated his beloved cable news for several days. As it became clear Mueller was nearing the end of his investigation, Trump appeared in a combative and sometimes foul mood. It was hard to separate the two things, and aides openly speculated his 50-tweet rage last weekend and his renewed attacks on Sen. John McCain were an attempt to counter-program the investigation's end.  A source close to the President, who spent time playing golf at his resort on Saturday, told CNN Trump is happy the investigation has finished and that \"no one is panicking\" ahead of the next Mueller-related news. The source added that \"we're letting it play out.\"  Others in Trump's orbit described him as cautiously optimistic, but with an emphasis on the caution: Trump did not tweet about the report -- or anything else -- on Saturday. Those who interacted with him described him as calm. \"What a great man, so down to earth and so fun to be with!!\" tweeted the singer Kid Rock, who joined Trump on the golf course. He posted a photo of photo of himself -- clad in American flag-print trousers -- alongside the President. On Friday, before the President sat down to dinner with his family at a cordoned-off table, he and his lawyer Flood were seen in easygoing conversation. Guests and aides said Trump was in a spirited mood as he was briefed on various pieces of information that were emerging from the Justice Department, including that Mueller was not recommending any further indictments. His eldest son Donald Trump Jr. -- long the subject of legal speculation -- mingled with guests, his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle by his side. Later, he appeared on stage at an fundraiser for the Palm Beach Republicans underway in the Louis XIV-style ballroom named in his honor. Trump didn't mention the Mueller report in his remarks -- but as his close ally Sen. Lindsey Graham was calling on the FBI to investigate Hillary Clinton, Trump looked on as the crowd broke into a \"lock her up\" chant. That could be a signal of the direction Trump and Republicans plan to head as the President launches his re-election campaign without the looming presence of the special counsel. White House aides and those close to Trump were universally optimistic on Friday and Saturday that Mueller's report would provide a boon politically, showing the Democrats and the media had vastly overstated the implications of the ongoing probe. \"It's a great day for America,\" one Trump campaign adviser said. \"We won.\" \"The fat lady has sung,\" another White House official said, adding that it's \"absolutely embarrassing\" for Democrats who have been predicting a collusion finding for two years. Persistent cloud Whether the report exonerates Trump or not, it has remained a persistent cloud on his presidency from the day it was announced in 2017. And it's colored the first half of the Trump presidency in ways that will forever be entwined with the country's 45th commander in chief. He's cycled through several iterations of a legal team, each offering their own strategy, from outright cooperation to a campaign to discredit the entire operation. His current lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has enjoyed a late-in-life return to political life as a tottering \u2014 and sometimes wildly off-message \u2014 legal guru. After recusing himself from oversight of the Mueller prove, Trump's first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, became a punching bag, never recovering the President's trust. After more than a year of insults, he departed last year. By Trump's own telling, the investigation had embarrassed him in front of foreign leaders, who he believed viewed him as less-than-legitimate amid questions about how he was elected. Developments kept popping up as he traveled abroad, from the Justice Department announcement it was appointing a special counsel days before his very first foreign trip to the testimony of his former lawyer Michael Cohen that dominated headlines while he was in Vietnam attempting to broker a nuclear deal with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump's denunciations of the investigation will be engraved in a modern political lexicon: \"No collusion,\" \"witch hunt\" and \"hoax\" have all been uttered or tweeted so often they now stand alone as political rallying cries, devoid of context or any explanation at the President's political rallies or on his social media.  The minutia of the investigation have become so engrained in the President's day-to-day patter, one sometimes forgets how complicated the whole thing was -- or the revelations that have been discovered as part of Mueller's probe.  For all of Trump's talk about \"lovers\" and \"dirty cops\" and \"12 angry Democrats,\" there have been startling discoveries about the President and his circle that would not have been uncovered were it not for the special counsel's work. His former campaign chairman is serving years in prison. His national security adviser lied to investigators. And Trump himself has been implicated in a campaign finance crime involving sex with a pornographic actress. Those discoveries have not seemed to damped Republicans' quiet glee at the comparatively benign ending to the Mueller investigation, though as of Saturday morning there were few people who could say for certain what was contained in the report. Perhaps the best indication the White House is still holding its breath: Trump's own silence. Instead of proclaiming victory from the podium of the Donald J. Trump Ballroom on Friday evening, the President avoided the topic altogether. Instead, he let the moment speak for itself. \"Enjoy yourselves,\" he told the crowd.","52":"Washington (CNN)Special counsel Robert Mueller's 22-month investigation was an often-shocking story about what Russians, Trump campaign associates and others did in the 2016 election so their preferred candidate could win. Now that investigation is complete. And the public, the media and Congress are anxiously waiting to learn what more, if anything, Mueller uncovered, and how much Attorney General William Barr will make public. Mueller's office has been notoriously silent, choosing instead to speak almost exclusively through court filings -- and with Mueller slipping out of his office unseen on Friday afternoon with no public statement to make and no more indictments to bring. The only public message, through a spokesman, was that Mueller would finish his service as special counsel \"in the coming days\" and that the office would be closing. However, what Mueller has revealed in court has already told the story of Russia's ambitious and brazen attempt to interfere with the 2016 presidential election, the operatives who aided -- wittingly or otherwise -- in that effort, and the extent to which people around Donald Trump lied when faced with tough questions. Along the way, the special counsel charged 37 criminal defendants, interviewed dozens of witnesses and subpoenaed terabytes of documents, revealing that Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton were far more extensive than previously known \u2014 and that multiple Trump associates were never as innocent as they claimed. What Mueller uncovered regarding the President's involvement remains a mystery. He has not brought charges against Trump or any of his family members, as some thought he would. He has not alleged a conspiracy to collude with the Russians.  Mueller also hasn't yet revealed what he learned about one of the key questions that has hung over the investigation: whether the President obstructed justice, first by pressuring then-FBI Director James Comey to go easy on former national security adviser Michael Flynn in 2017, and then by firing Comey, which Trump later admitted was tied to the Russia investigation. There are still lingering, unanswered questions about what new information Mueller's team uncovered that didn't add up to a criminal indictment and thus remains shielded from public view. Mueller's team of prosecutors also uncovered alleged criminal activity that opened up a cascade of connected investigations and prosecutions from other sections of the Justice Department against Russians working in America, foreign lobbyists and even Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen. Some of these, like a probe into the Trump inauguration's donations and spending and another into Cohen's campaign finance violation of paying off women, continue to this day and will not end with the conclusion of the special counsel's investigation.   The next phase of the Mueller investigation could be a desperate political fight to provide details from the investigation to Congress and the public, one that could spark a prolonged court battle. But the special counsel has already exposed a range of revelations to the American public: \u2014 The dirty deeds of Paul Manafort are central to the investigation: Prosecutors made clear in court filings that the former Trump campaign chairman's ties to powerful pro-Russian Ukrainians ran to the \"heart\" of the collusion investigation and were not just about Manafort's lobbying business, including his continued contact with a Russian man accused of witness tampering and having ties to Russian intelligence. \u2014 The surprising start to the Russia probe: A relatively unknown campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, was thrust to the center of the collusion allegations after he was charged with lying to the FBI about speaking to a Russian-linked professor who told him about \"dirt\" on the Hillary Clinton campaign. His encounter with an Australian diplomat, in which he bragged about what he had been told, sparked the FBI's counterintelligence investigation in July 2016 that eventually became Mueller's probe into collusion. \u2014 The many lies from Trump world: Despite Trump's initial claims that his campaign had no contacts with Russia, we now know of at least 16 officials who in fact had contact with Russians during the campaign and transition. Not only that, but the special counsel charged six people close to the President with lying about their contacts \u2014 raising the question, still unanswered, of why did they lie?   \u2014 Russia's sophisticated operation: Mueller's filings provided painstaking detail about how Russia's election interference went well beyond hacking Democrats and included a sophisticated social media propaganda effort that, allegedly, was ultimately backed by the Russian government. The Justice Department, in additional court filings, has now alleged that subversion effort continues on social media sites to this day.   This is a retelling of how Mueller's work played out and what the special counsel found.   Papa-Who? It was almost six months before Mueller made his first public moves. When he did, the cases put the investigation further into the Trump campaign than many had expected, thanks to a surprise indictment of a little-known figure. Mueller's first charges alleged a broad criminal lobbying business scheme for Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates, an accusation that was widely expected. Manafort had long been on the shortlist of targets with various witnesses walking in and out of the federal courthouse in Washington to testify against him to a grand jury in the months before Mueller made a move. The indictment, once public, only alleged Manafort and Gates committed crimes before the Trump campaign began. The White House seized on the timeframe. The President tweeted that day \"there is NO COLLUSION!\"   But while Trump was crowing about no collusion, Mueller later that day announced another criminal case against a little-known campaign adviser named George Papadopoulos. As revealed in the plea documents, Papadopoulos, a 20-something from Chicago, heard that the Russians had \"dirt\" on Clinton early in 2016, then lobbied campaign officials to arrange a meeting with the Russian government \u2014 maybe even one between Trump himself and Vladimir Putin, according to court documents. Papadopoulos then lied to investigators about his interactions with a woman claiming to be related to Putin and to a mysterious Russia-linked foreign professor. The announcement of Papadopoulos' case was such a left turn the special counsel's spokesman misspelled his last name when the office first announced his plea. (It was corrected days after the unsealing.) Trump and associates downgraded Papadopoulos' role on the Trump campaign's foreign policy team, calling him a \"coffee boy,\" and his significance in the investigation wasn't made clear.   But the transcript of that plea hearing shows that the Mueller team dropped the first clue of what was to come. \"There's a large-scale ongoing investigation of which this case is a small part,\" prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky said in court. Manafort and Gates With Papadopoulos' charge revealed and his sentencing put on hold, the public focus quickly shifted back to Manafort and Gates. The pair vowed to fight their charges of money laundering, tax crimes and foreign lobbying violations. Both were placed on house arrests, and the government seized their passports. A day after their arrests, on Halloween, Mueller outlined how much more he knew about the two top-level political men. The two had connections to Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs, traveled extensively abroad, moved money through offshore accounts and hid millions of dollars acquired through off-the-books Ukrainian political work. But how did the past transgressions of the former Trump campaign chair and the deputy chair fit in to Mueller's attempt to find the truth of the 2016 presidential election? For months, Mueller wouldn't say. Instead, he turned his attention to others who had also always been suspected to be in the middle of the probe. Flynn and the Russians Next up was Michael Flynn. On Dec. 1, 2017, the former lieutenant general and Trump national security adviser on the campaign and, briefly, in the White House strode into a packed federal courtroom with an entourage of family members and lawyers. He pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about several things, namely his conversations with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the Trump presidential transition. The pair had discussed over a series of phone calls the US position toward economic sanctions on Russia and the Russian response.READ: Flynn charges and plea agreement here   Sanctions have long been a thorn in the US-Russia relationship, and with Flynn's case in place, Mueller had found a motivation that later became a theme among some Trump associates' contacts with Russia. Mueller had learned Flynn was in touch with officials on the Trump transition team about his calls with Kislyak. While Flynn and Kislyak were exchanging phone calls, Trump associates at the President-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida over Christmas and New Year's 2016, Mueller said, and kept in touch with Flynn. At this point, Mueller's cases against Flynn and Papadopoulos pointed to moments on the campaign and transition. Other top advisers around Trump knew about the interactions on Russia. Still, Mueller had no \"collusion\" to detail. The 13 Russians By February 2018, Mueller had his next big case to drop. The special counsel's Office introduced to the public a Russia-based company with an amorphous name, the Internet Research Agency. Mueller detailed in his court filings how the IRA, two other companies operating under the name \"Concord\" and 13 Russians allegedly executed an elaborate social media propaganda conspiracy in 2016. Some traveled to the US, got in touch with grassroots political operatives and campaign officials, then created fake online accounts to spread misinformation across Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter. One of those Russians directing the operation, Mueller alleged, was a catering executive and businessman named  Yevgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch so close to Putin he's often described as \"Putin's chef.\" The allegations unmasked the extent to which misinformation had infiltrated the American political psyche, driving conservatives and liberals further away from one another. The Russians allegedly encouraged black voters to skip voting in the 2016 election, Muslim voters to demonstrate for Clinton, and Trump supporters in Florida, New York and Pennsylvania to rally. At one point, one of the Russian co-conspirators had an American hold a sign in front of the White House that wished Prigozhin a happy 55th birthday.   Concord Management and Consulting, the parent company of Prigozhin's catering business, was indicted in the case and has tapped a US law firm to fight the case on its behalf. The Russian company says it's not guilty. That challenge is ongoing. The defense team continues to try to pry open evidence in the case for its clients to see. At the same time, the prosecutors are daring Prigozhin to come to the US and face the court. In June 2018, Mueller landed another indictment against Russian government-backed operatives. The new case accused 12 military intelligence officers of hacking Democratic officials in 2016. This case had long been expected when Mueller opened it, since it essentially bolstered a January 2017 report by US intelligence agencies that detailed how the Russian government orchestrated the attack on the Democrats and Clinton's campaign.   Mueller's filings allege that the Russians, after looting the political computers and accounts, released batches of emails themselves online, and sent some to WikiLeaks for maximum political effect. The email releases came as a bombshell days before the Democratic National Convention in 2016, and again on the same day in October 2016 that an \"Access Hollywood\" tape of Trump bragging about grabbing women sexually went public.  The leak before the convention ultimately forced the resignation of DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who came under fire for favoring Clinton over her primary challenger Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. This was the \"dirt\" Papadopoulos had heard about, that Mueller had tracked down in full by July 2018.    Six months later, at the end of 2018, Mueller tied the hackers to a willingness among more Trump campaign advisers to get that same dirt. But before he got to that, Mueller had more to reveal.   Turning the Screws Mueller's prosecutors plodded along with their court filings in Manafort and Gates' proceeding. Week by week, from October 2017 and then going forward, they used the court record to trickle out damning details that would squeeze Gates and Manafort closer to cooperation. As the two tried to get out from their house arrest restrictions, prosecutors dug into their banking history, making it harder for the men to find millions of dollars they could use as collateral for bail. The prosecutors changed and added to their indictments, making it clear how much they knew. The defendants' legal bills skyrocketed. Manafort's defense team at one point, in April 2018, unsuccessfully challenged Mueller's approach, saying the special counsel had no authority to pursue Manafort's long-ago crimes in Ukraine when he should be focused on Russia and the election. But prosecutor Michael Dreeben let on that Manafort's work in Ukraine may connect back to Russia. \"Here you have somebody who was a campaign official in the Trump campaign, that he had longstanding ties to Russia-backed politicians in the Ukraine,\" Dreeben said on behalf of Mueller at a court hearing. \"What were the nature of those connections? Did they provide means for surreptitious communications? Did they provide back channels to Russia? Investigators will naturally look at those things.\" To bolster this argument, Dreeben relied on what may be the single most important document made public so far in the Mueller investigation. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had written a memo for Mueller two-and-a-half months after his appointment in 2017. This became known as the \"August 2 memo\" and spelled out exactly who and what Mueller should investigate, including Manafort's years of financial ties in Ukraine and communications with Russians in 2016. The three-page memo that prosecutors revealed in the court filing is still largely redacted. No charge related to the allegation against Manafort's efforts in 2016 has been brought. Gates flips The special counsel's office found other ways to bear down on Manafort: line up cooperators against him and get him sent to jail. Ultimately, Mueller landed the man who could be the most damaging witness against Manafort, his former partner Gates, who proved to be the star witness. Gates' house arrest in Richmond had been a burden for him, his wife and four children. He'd struggled with financing his legal fees as he fought his charges alongside Manafort, his long-time boss. While keeping the public front that he was preparing for trial, Gates secretly hired a top Washington defense attorney to negotiate a deal with Mueller beginning in January 2018. The next month, Gates' new defense lawyer publicly announced his role the night before Gates walked into court to plead guilty to a much-reduced pair of crimes. He agreed to cooperate and began spilling what he knew of Manafort over more than 20 interview sessions with Mueller, his lawyer has said in court filings. And he prepared to help the prosecution in the trial of his former boss.   Manafort march to trial About a month before Manafort was set to go to trial, prosecutors revealed they had followed conversations between him and his Russian associate Konstantin Kilimnik as they attempted to get in touch with their lobbying contacts and shape what they might tell investigators. As a result, both Kilimnik, now living in Moscow, and Manafort were indicted for witness tampering. A federal judge revoked Manafort's house arrest, putting him in near-solitary detention in Virginia. He has stayed under those conditions since then. Kilimnik also surfaced when another witness was charged with lying: Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch lawyer who worked with Manafort and Gates on a public relations strategy in Ukraine. In a filing detailing how van der Zwaan covered up what he knew about communications in 2016 between Kilimnik and his Ukrainian lobbying partners, Mueller slipped in a key detail the FBI had learned: In 2016, Kilimnik had ties to Russian intelligence.   Manafort's trial began in Alexandria, Virginia in late July 2018. Prosecutors detailed the trappings of Manafort's luxurious life -- fine clothes, expensive rugs, landscapers and contractors -- to outline how he got rich in Ukraine, then hid the money in foreign bank accounts and used the cash to support his lavish spending. They showed dozens of emails, including one where Manafort wrote to Gates \"WTF? ... You told me you were on top of this,\" regarding keeping his tax payments artificially low.   Gates took the stand against his former boss over three days of the trial. The questioning badly damaged Gates' credibility, after he admitted to stealing from Manafort \u2014 possibly from the Trump political operation, too \u2014 and said he had an affair. But the damage was worse for Manafort. Gates detailed how Manafort had orchestrated years of financial fraud.   After deliberating for about four days, on August 21, the jury convicted Manafort on eight financial fraud charges. The jurors couldn't agree unanimously on 10 other financial charges \u2014 but among them, only one juror had doubt of Manafort's guilt. In an extraordinary bit of timing, the same hour a jury in Virginia read its guilty verdict for Manafort, Trump's long-time lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to several financial crimes including tax fraud and campaign finance violations. Crucially, in his plea, Cohen implicated the President, whom Cohen told the court had directed him to pay hush money in the final days of the campaign to women who were alleging affairs with Trump. Trump has denied the affairs. In the span of an hour, Mueller had secured a conviction of Trump's former campaign manager and the long-time personal lawyer to Trump had turned against the President. Cohen began meeting with Mueller's team and eventually pleaded guilty to an additional lying charge. Mueller's subsequent case against Cohen revealed that the Trump Organization and Trump's family had worked on a plan to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow throughout the first half of 2016 while Trump campaigned for the presidency \u2014 much further into 2016 than Cohen had testified to Congress in 2017 and that Trump publicly claimed. Things speed up With Manafort damaged and Cohen on board, Mueller moved many of his cases toward their final positions. Manafort was headed for a second trial in DC about his Ukrainian lobbying and dozens among Washington's elite were lined as possible witnesses. Manafort \u2014 after holding prosecutors off for 11 months \u2014 finally admitted to his crimes in September 2018 and agreed to cooperate with Mueller.   Papadopoulos' and Flynn's criminal cases also fast-tracked to a close in the fall of 2018. Prosecutors said Papadopoulos had never really been helpful to them and had even thwarted their ability to question the mysterious foreign professor who knew about the Russians' \"dirt\" on Clinton before it was released. Papadopoulos got two weeks in prison. Flynn, on the other hand, had proven more useful. Mueller's team told a federal judge their well-known cooperator deserved no jail time because he had contributed substantially to ongoing investigations. Flynn's cooperation \"likely affected the decisions of related firsthand witnesses to be forthcoming\" with investigators, Mueller's team wrote. With that assertion about other witnesses, Mueller put a point on what had become most perilous for so many defendants during the probe: Significant lies would be charged as crimes. Flynn readied for his sentencing in December. The hearing started like any other, with prosecutors and defense counsel on friendly terms. But the judge, Emmet Sullivan of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, came ready with tough questions. Sullivan was appalled by Flynn's actions, especially while the military leader sat in the West Wing speaking with the FBI. Sullivan asked whether Flynn could have been charged with treason. Did Flynn realize how he had disgraced the American flag? The special counsel's office said no, treason was never a line Flynn crossed-- and Sullivan said he had misunderstood the timeline of Flynn's private lobbying. But Sullivan's lecture left its mark. Flynn's attorneys realized the peril for their client in that charged moment and asked the judge not to sentence him that day. Flynn has finished cooperating with the investigation, prosecutors have said, but may still be of use as a witness in another case brought by the Justice Department against his former lobbying partner. Flynn's sentencing has not yet been rescheduled. Cohen, too, received a sentence. He'll go to prison in May for almost three years for his financial fraud crimes. For lying to Congress, he got two months in prison, though that time won't make the time he serves lengthier. At Cohen's sentencing, also in December, Mueller prosecutor Jeannie Rhee spoke about \"core Russia-related issues under investigation\" for which Cohen gave \"credible and reliable\" information. This statement still hasn't been explained.  But what Cohen knows and did for Trump has clearly been a live current throughout Mueller's tenure. The special counsel's office got access to his campaign-time and earlier emails beginning in July 2017- two months after Mueller's appointment. Other parts of Justice Department investigations involving Cohen are still under seal.  There are additional unresolved questions. Cohen has alleged in public testimony to Congress that he overheard Trump and Roger Stone speaking during the campaign about Wikileaks emails that could hurt the Democrats. Trump and Stone have denied the conversation happened. Stone zone With seven defendants sentenced or heading that direction and two dozen Russians charged, Mueller had one more case to unlock. Stone, Manafort's former lobbying partner-turned-Republican spin doctor, awoke to a swarm of FBI agents on his lawn in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on January 25, 2019. CNN had tracked the grand jury foot traffic for months and positioned a camera crew on Stone's lawn early that morning, with the possibility an indictment was coming. \"FBI, warrant,\" the heavily armed agents yelled as they knocked on Stone's door just after 6 a.m. that day. The arrest caught on tape became one of the most viral moments of Mueller's work. Stone had been charged under seal the day before by the grand jury in the DC courthouse for obstruction, lying during a congressional proceeding and threatening witnesses who might have contradicted his congressional statements. Mueller alleged that Stone attempted to reach WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign about the stolen Democratic emails and that Stone wanted to understand the \"dirt\" the hackers found before new batches dropped. The most tantalizing allegation Mueller leveled against Stone was that he was \"contacted by\" senior Trump campaign staffers also keen on learning about what WikiLeaks might drop to hurt Clinton. The Stone criminal case is ongoing. Stone has pleaded not guilty and is under strict orders not to speak publicly about the case, the court or Mueller.  'Heart' of the Investigation Just after Thanksgiving 2018, prosecutors revealed another bombshell development: They believed Manafort was lying to them and the grand jury. This left Manafort with little leverage. He was already in jail and no longer useful to prosecutors. It was time for him to be sentenced. Manafort, now grayed after eight months in jail and using a wheelchair, said he never intended to lie. Prosecutors submitted more than 800 pages of evidence suggesting he did, and the judge agreed. In a filing leading up to the decision, Manafort's attorneys redacted their document badly, allowing the public to copy and read text beneath the blacked-out sections in digital copies.  That text said Manafort had discussed with Kilimnik about a Ukraine peace plan and had shared 2016 polling data with him. The polling data revelation, especially, sent the Trump camp dialing back their blanket \"no collusion\" claims. \"I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or people in the campaign,\" Trump's personal defense attorney Rudy Giuliani said on CNN in response to the Manafort filing. \"I said the President of the United States.\"   In one of the hearings about the lies, Mueller prosecutor Andrew Weissmann gave one more nod to where Mueller's been headed all along, which has still not been revealed in full. Manafort and Kilimnik had met on August 2, 2016, at a cigar bar in Manhattan while Manafort led the Trump campaign. They talked about their old contacts in Ukraine and about a policy idea for peace that touched on US sanctions against Russia -- the same idea Flynn had discussed with Kislyak after the election.   Judge Jackson pressed the special counsel's office on its apparent obsession with Kilimnik's efforts. \"Why is that important?\" she asked. Weissmann responded with an answer that's still largely redacted in the court file. He began by saying, \"Okay. So, I mean, this goes to the larger view of what we think is going on, and what we think the motive here is.\" Kilimnik had a Russian intelligence connection, Weissmann reminded her. Then he turned to Manafort, saying, \"There is an in-person meeting at an unusual time for somebody who is the campaign chairman to be spending time, and to be doing it in person. That meeting and what happened at that meeting is of significance to the special counsel.\" It was the \"heart\" of the investigation, he added. Prosecutors have yet to close the loop on whether this meeting of great significance led them to something larger.   But they did earn hefty penalties time for Manafort. The former Trump campaign chairman was sentenced to a total of 7.5 years in prison, and is giving up $35 million of his assets in forfeiture to the US government and restitution to victims.   In his final report, Mueller is poised to answer this: Do Manafort and Kilimnik, Stone and WikiLeaks, Flynn and Papadopoulos, the hackers and the troll farm, and the Trump campaign and the Russian government have more than lies and coincidences in common? The answers, for now, are still under seal.","53":" (CNN)Michael Cohen's depiction this week of how the Trump Organization manipulated figures to change the value of the company opened up the possibility that Donald Trump's strategy of using the illusion of vast wealth as an ego- and image-enhancing measure might also have been a crime. In his public congressional testimony on Wednesday, Cohen indicated that his former client potentially committed a variety of financial crimes from bank to tax fraud in order to secure loans and even to move up in Forbes magazine's rankings of the very rich. It's not clear whether Cohen's claims are being pursued by criminal investigators, but top Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, chair of the House Oversight Committee, said Wednesday that congressional committees are already divvying up the revelations for further investigation. \"We got a lot of information that I think will be -- we may not look into it in our committee, but one of the five or six committees will, and that's one of things that we have to discuss to figure out,\" Cummings told reporters. Cohen testified that, in 2014 when Trump was making a play for the Buffalo Bills football team, he provided financial statements to his long-time lender that his former attorney now claims were inflated. Among the documents that Cohen provided to Congress were Trump's financial statements for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013. The documents showed a near doubling in Trump's net worth from $4.26 billion in 2011 and $4.56 billion 2012 to $8.66 billion in 2013. The leap was attributed to $4 billion in \"brand value.\" \"These documents and others were provided to Deutsche Bank on one occasion when I was with him in our attempt to obtain money so that we can put a bid on the Buffalo Bills,\" Cohen told the House Oversight Committee. A lawyer for the Trump Organization declined to comment to CNN Thursday. Earlier Thursday morning, Trump dismissed Cohen's testimony during a news conference in Hanoi, Vietnam. \"He lied a lot,\" Trump said following his summit with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un. \"He lied about so many different things.\" Trump never did get a loan from Deutsche Bank to bid for the football team. But Trump has borrowed more than $300 million in loans from the German lender. Deutsche Bank has been the only major bank willing to loan to the Trump Organization for much of the last two decades. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment. Cohen also alleged that Trump inflated assets provided to an insurance company and when asked if there was other wrongdoing he was aware of that hadn't come up in testimony Cohen replied, \"Yes, and again, those are part of the investigation that's currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York.\" Cohen offered only three internal financial documents as his proof, but no other documents to bolster his claims. He alleged that the Trump Organization manipulated financial statements by deriving value for a property by comparing it to another higher-valued asset or by making up a number to get to the desired outcome. Cohen explained that when looking to value one of the Trump properties at 40 Wall Street, they found an asset that was roughly the same size, 1.2 million square feet, and then worked to \"find an asset that is comparable, find the highest price per square foot that's achieved in the area and apply it to that building.\" Another strategy, he explained, was to \"make up the multiple\" -- a backwards approach that Cohen said was \"based upon what [Trump] wanted to value the asset at.\"   Providing false statements to a bank to obtain a loan is a crime even if the loan is not ultimately granted. But experts said whether a crime was committed turns on several factors, such as if the numbers are truly false and what the intent of the person was in coming up with the number. \"Everyone knows appraisals are really soft numbers that are spongy,\" said one accounting professor who declined to be identified. \"You're making yourself look better, which is not uncommon. The question is, 'Is it done in a way that's beyond the norm and is fraudulent.'\" In 2012, Trump valued a property in Westchester County, New York, at $291 million. In 2018, the same property was listed in Trump's federal ethics filings as being worth between $25 million and $50 million. The discrepancy was first reported by the New York Times. Cohen also said Trump \"deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.\" And he alleged they would play with the number when dealing with insurance companies. \"When we were dealing, later on, with insurance companies, we would provide them with these copies so that they would understand that the premium, which is based sometimes upon the individual's capabilities to pay, would be reduced,\" he testified.  Much of Cohen's testimony was uncorroborated and it's unclear how much of it is part of the sprawling investigation by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. Cohen pleaded guilty last year in the southern district to federal campaign finance violations, lying to a bank and tax fraud relating to his personal accounts. During his testimony, Cohen was also asked if there were any other illegal activities that he hadn't been questioned about. He said, \"Yes, and again, those are part of the investigation that's currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York.\" A spokesman for the US attorney's office declined to comment. But Cohens' testimony was restricted based on his communications with prosecutors and the special counsel's office. One lawyer said since Cohen is discussing the matters in public it seems less likely they are a focus of an ongoing investigation. \"It seems likely given what Cohen said that those matters are no longer under investigation if they ever were,\" said Daniel R Alonso, a former federal prosecutor.","54":"Washington (CNN)The New York attorney general's office issued subpoenas on Monday to two banks for records relating to the funding of several Trump Organization projects, The New York Times reported.   Citing an unnamed source briefed on the subpoenas, the Times reported that the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James opened a new inquiry based on the testimony of Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen before Congress last month. The inquiry is a civil investigation, not a criminal probe, the Times said, adding that its scope and focus were unclear. Cohen testified that Trump inflated his assets and presented copies of financial statements he said were provided to Deutsche Bank. Investigators requested financial records from the German lender related to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, the Trump National Doral outside Miami, the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, and an unsuccessful effort to buy the NFL Buffalo Bills, the Times reported. Investors Bank, based in New Jersey, \"was subpoenaed for records relating to Trump Park Avenue\" in Manhattan, the Times said.  CNN has reached out to the New York attorney general's office and Investors Bank. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Deutsche Bank is already the subject of a joint investigation between the House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees into Trump's businesses and money laundering involving Russia.  The committees' top Democrats have been interested in Deutsche Bank because it's one of the few big banks willing to lend to the Trump Organization. Trump businesses have borrowed over $300 million from Deutsche Bank to finance the company's Florida golf course and hotels in Chicago and Washington, according to financial disclosures and public filings from 2012 to 2015.","55":"Washington (CNN)Robert Mueller's latest service to America is all but complete. But the reverberations from his yet-to-be-revealed report could amount to inestimable political and constitutional consequences. The conclusion of the special counsel's investigation was an important landmark in itself, at a moment in America's modern history when governing institutions are under intense strain. It demonstrated that so far at least, a credible legal examination is possible into the most explosive of charges against an unchained President, without interference and despite the bitter polarization of the times. The question now is whether everyone accepts the result. The nation could learn within days whether Mueller answered key inquiries: Did Trump cooperate with a hostile foreign power to win the 2016 election? Did he use that platform to seek to enrich himself with multi-billion dollar business deals in Russia? Did the President obstruct justice, including by firing FBI Director James Comey, in an effort to cover it all up? And is there any evidence to suggest why Trump often appears to be obedient to Russian President Vladimir Putin, following fears felt deep within the FBI that the US President was compromised? And can he explain the multiple suspicions contacts between Trump's associates and Russians -- both before and after the election -- and the lies they all told about those relationships? Trump's team is already celebrating, claiming it is already clear that the President has already been vindicated since Mueller did not indict anyone for cooperating with Russian election meddling. The lack of charges against Trump's son, Donald Jr. and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who were involved in a 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians offering \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton, especially disappointed his critics. Their escape proved the shrewdness of Trump's consistent messaging that the only question that mattered in an investigation that held Washington spellbound for two years was whether there was collusion. \"The fat lady has sung,\" one Trump aide told CNN's Jim Acosta. For now, consistent with Mueller's tightly controlled investigation, no one outside the Justice Department knows what is in the report, how long it is and how much it deals with the President's own actions. But its delivery sets up an even bigger test for Washington's political institutions than those involved in getting it safely to its culmination. So much political and emotional capital has been invested in Mueller's probe by partisans on all sides that it's already clear that it will not mark a moment of catharsis that will once and for all drain the bitter poison of the 2016 election. Mueller is sure to anger millions of Americans who do not find validation for their set-in-stone political convictions in an assessment that could conceivably dictate the fate of the Trump presidency. The choices made in the coming days and the revelations to come are likely to ensure that whatever Mueller's report says, the question of Russia's assault on the last presidential election will stain the next one in 20 months. Attorney General William Barr, a pillar of the legal establishment, weeks into his second spell in the job, now assumes the crucial historic role of deciding how much of the report the White House will initially see, and the extent to which Mueller's conclusions will be shared with Congress and the public. Still, even if there is not legal liability for the President or his family in the Mueller report, it could still inflict significant political damage. Peril still lurks for Trump The biggest peril for Trump always lay in the obstruction question and whether there was conduct on his part that Mueller could not charge in deference to the tradition that a sitting President can't be indicted. Democrats wasted little time in demanding the full and swift release of Mueller's entire report, seeking the evidentiary haul behind to power their own investigations. But they have a sensitive set of decisions as well. If the report in any way vindicates Trump, Democrats could endanger their new House majority by continuing to pursue him aggressively. Republicans will argue that if Mueller, a decorated former Marine and ultimate Washington straight arrow, clears Trump, a new flurry of investigations would amount to presidential persecution. However the political battle shapes up, it's important to realize that the Mueller probe -- though it has dominated Washington's attention for nearly two years -- is only one piece of the legal puzzle gathering around Trump. It is unclear how much evidence Mueller can present on the question of contacts between Russians and people in Trump's orbit since the counter-intelligence side of the investigation -- which could still be going on at the FBI -- involves classified information, sources and methods. There are also multiple criminal and civil cases threatening Trump, his businesses, his inaugural committee and his presidential transition. The most perilous appears to be one launched by the US attorney's office in the Southern District of New York that has already implicated Trump in campaign finance offenses over hush money payments made to women who alleged affairs with him before the election. Then there are multiple investigations launched by Democratic House committees that if they do not result in grounds or the political motivation for an impeachment drive, could be used to make a case against Trump to lay before voters in 2020. Where do Barr and Mueller go from here?   Barr spent several hours reading the Mueller report in his office after the special counsel handed it over just before 5 p.m. ET on Friday afternoon. Now he must decide whether there are sufficient grounds to share parts of it with White House lawyers in anticipation of executive privilege assertions -- a move that could give Trump and his team the chance to mount a pre-emptive defense. In a surprise, a Justice Department official said that Barr could brief lawmakers on his takeaways from the Mueller report as soon as this weekend. That means that the crucial answers from Mueller's investigation could emerge publicly more quickly than expected. Still, a constitutional showdown still seems likely. Evidence gathered by Mueller about the firing of Comey, the President's conversations about Russia with his fired national security adviser Mike Flynn and his conversations with aides about the Trump Tower meeting once he was President could all be subject to executive privilege assertions. Democrats with subpoena battle could then launch a court battle that could drag on for months. And Democrats are already threatening action if the whole of the report, and all of its supporting evidence is not quickly released. They also may call on the special counsel to explain himself in person. \"I think the American people need to hear from Mr. Mueller,\" said California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, on CNN. One of the difficulties in assessing how the Mueller drama will unfold from here is that the structure of his report remains unclear -- even though a Justice Department official described it as \"comprehensive.\" Will he, for instance, confine himself to an examination of criminal matters -- and a explanation of the charges he laid against 37 people and entities, including associates of Trump like former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump's ex-attorney Michael Cohen and his reasons for not charging other key players? Or has the special counsel told a story of political offenses committed by the President and his team, that could be potentially relevant to the question of impeachment? How has he dealt with the intense public interest in his investigation and the President's conduct -- and the wider mission of uncovering and explaining an attempt by Russian intelligence agencies to sway the 2016 election to Trump? How Trump will spin the outcome   It must have come as a huge relief for the President that no one in his immediate family was indicted and Mueller did not lay charges on the question of conspiracy to collude with Russia to interfere in the election. There have been plenty of dark days for the President during the Russia investigation. But the news that Mueller would make no more indictments arrived as he settled into his Mar-a-Lago resort for a weekend with friends -- surrounded by his legal and political teams. One person close to Trump told CNN's Pamela Brown that \"we won\" and that the campaign -- which has been tainted for two years by the suggestion of wrongdoing -- was absolved. \"Zero indictments mean we're clear,\" the person said. Trump's legal team can also claim a victory since they were able to protect their client by not permitting him to sit for an interview under oath with Mueller -- a situation that could have exposed the President to the possibility of perjury. The President did provide answers to written questions filed by Mueller, with the help of his counsel. Still, the President's team faces nervous hours until they can learn the entirety of the report. Whether Mueller finds a pattern of repeated obstruction by the President remains a mystery. It's also possible that the special counsel outlines a pattern of behavior related to Russia, that if known by voters before November 2016, would have appeared deeply unpatriotic and made it impossible for him to win the presidency. While there was a mood of celebration in the Trump camp on Friday night -- things could quickly change. The President has made clear that if Mueller delivers a result favorable to him, he will see the report as accurate and fair. Despite months of angry tweets and comments insulting Mueller and his team, the President is likely to quickly pivot to using the special counsel's sterling reputation to his own advantage. But if he is criticized in the report, it will validate in his own mind, the endless claims that the whole exercise was a \"witch hunt\" all along. The President's legal team has gamed out a range of strategies to cope with a report that is highly critical of Trump, that is mixed, or offers him a measure of validation, CNN has reported. Democrats face a choice   Indications that Barr may be able to brief lawmakers soon about the report sparked immediate speculation, alongside the lack of new indictments, that the Mueller report could be more favorable to the President than expected. Democrats appeared to be preparing for that possibility by stressing that the report was just the beginning of a new phase of the Russia intrigue. In a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, warned that Barr should not give the White House a \"sneak preview\" of the report. In an apparently coordinated messaging blitz, key Democratic leaders and presidential candidates issued statements demanding the immediate public release of Mueller's entire report and evidence backing it up. Such a trove would be valuable for the multiple House committees that are delving into almost every aspect of Trump's business and political affairs. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff made clear that his investigation would look at questions that may not be covered by Mueller, including why Manafort gave polling data to a Russian contact with links to Kremlin intelligence agencies. He also pledged to look at whether Trump was compromised by his business or other links with Russia from before he became President. \"If they are not answered, we are going to have to answer them,\" Schiff told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. His comments showed that while Mueller's decision to file a report and end his investigation was a milestone moment, it was also the start of a new beginning of the Russia saga.","56":"Washington (CNN)Four leading Democrats are demanding a new FBI investigation into a Florida woman's apparent ties to Donald Trump, focusing on whether she illegally sought to leverage her relationship with the President by selling access to Chinese clients. The Democrats -- Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler -- are calling on the FBI to conduct criminal and counterintelligence probes into allegations of human trafficking, foreign lobbying and potential campaign finance violations against Cindy Yang, the founder and former owner of a chain of Florida massage parlors. The Democrats' letter says Yang's website used to offer clients \"the opportunity to interact with the President\" and other top political leaders, and they point to public reports saying she has been a frequent guest of Trump's, including at his Mar-a-Lago estate. \"Although Ms. Yang's activities may only be those of an unscrupulous actor allegedly selling access to politicians for profit, her activities also could permit adversary governments or their agents access to these same politicians to acquire potential material for blackmail or other even more nefarious purposes,\" the lawmakers wrote. The letter, addressed to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Secret Service Director Randolph Alles, asks for responses by Thursday to a number of questions about her contacts with Trump. \"We have seen the Democratic partisan letter and allegations. Our firm will represent our client and her interest as an American through any developments in this case. It seems as another politically driven expedition. We will be addressing these matters when appropriate,\" said Yang's attorney, Evan Turk, in a statement. Last month, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was charged with soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor in Florida, as part of a months-long police sting operation investigating a prostitution and sex trafficking ring operating in southern Florida. Yang founded the spa, but sold her interest in the company years ago. Kraft has pleaded not guilty.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on the letter that the \"facts in this situation are very concerning and we urge Director Wray to adhere to the joint bicameral requests of the Democratic Senate ranking members and Democratic House chairmen and start an investigation.\"","57":"New York (CNN)The New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan has disbarred Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, after Cohen pleaded guilty last year to multiple felony charges, according to a decision released Tuesday.  A five-judge panel found that Cohen, who began a three-day stretch of congressional testimony on Tuesday, should be disbarred for his federal conviction for having previously made false statements to Congress, the decision said.  Though Cohen's disbarment was widely expected in legal circles, for a onetime trusted legal adviser to the President to be stricken from the roll of attorneys in New York state nevertheless constituted another striking step in the escalating consequences of the investigation into Cohen.  Cohen, who pleaded guilty in two cases to an array of charges that included campaign-finance violations connected to his work for Trump, is scheduled to report to prison for a three-year sentence beginning on May 6.  The decision was posted online early Tuesday evening. It was released two days earlier than initially intended, according to the New York Law Journal. On Tuesday afternoon, paper copies of the decision, containing the same text but dated February 28, were distributed to reporters in the courthouse press room. Court officials declined to confirm that those copies were legitimate and told CNN the decision was not ready to be released, only to then post it online with Tuesday's date. Lanny Davis, an adviser to Cohen, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Cohen's disbarment. Though an attorney for Trump, Rudy Giuliani, on several occasions has raised concerns that Cohen could have violated attorney-client privilege, the decision from the court didn't address that subject.  In New York, conviction of a federal felony triggers disbarment if the offense would constitute a felony under state law.  The court has repeatedly found that a conviction for making false statements to Congress \"is analogous to a conviction under the New York felony of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree and, therefore, automatic disbarment is appropriate herein,\" the decision said.","58":"London and Moscow (CNN)Senate investigators want to question a Moscow-based American businessman with longstanding ties to President Donald Trump after witnesses told them he could shed light on the President's commercial and personal activities in Russia dating back to the 1990s, multiple sources have told CNN.  The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is probing allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 elections, has been keen to speak with David Geovanis for several months, the sources say.  Geovanis helped organize a 1996 trip to Moscow by Trump, who was in the early stages of pursuing what would become a long-held goal of building a Trump Tower in the Russian capital, according to multiple media reports at the time. Years later, Geovanis worked for the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, whose ties to Trump's 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort have also been of interest to investigators. Two witnesses who have given evidence to the Senate Intelligence Committee say they were asked about Geovanis' past relationship with the President during interviews last year. The interviews were conducted by staff working for both the Republican and Democratic sides of the committee, according to the sources, who wish to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the Senate inquiry. This is the first time that Geovanis' name has been revealed in connection with the various investigations underway into Russian influence on US politics, which include a sweeping new House investigation into Trump's financial interests. The Senate Intelligence Committee's interest in Geovanis indicates its investigation is delving further back into Trump's past in Russia than previously thought.  A businessman, three women and Joseph Stalin One of the two witnesses says the committee has a photograph of a younger Geovanis apparently posing in a portrait with three partially clothed women. The portrait, once displayed in a Russian gallery under the title \"The Capitalist,\" depicts the subjects in front of a picture of the former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. It's not clear whether the portrait is a single photograph or a composite.  The witness told CNN that they were shown the photograph during questioning.  A third witness has alleged in written testimony, seen by CNN, that Geovanis may be valuable in the mystery of whether Russia has material on Trump that could be personally embarrassing to him.  Known by the nickname \"Geo\" to his friends, Geovanis was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, and is a graduate of Trump's alma mater, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. After starting his career in finance, Geovanis went to Moscow to work for a Russian venture of a company called Brooke Group, which owned land earmarked for the site of a proposed Trump Tower. When Trump came to town to promote the project, sources say, it was Geovanis' job to show him around. Also on the trip were Brooke Group's owners, the real estate moguls Bennett LeBow and Howard Lorber, who went on to become substantial donors to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Trump personally acknowledged the pair from the podium after he won the 2016 New York Republican primary. An archive video report of Trump's 1996 Moscow trip emerged online in late January. The news report -- misidentified on YouTube as dating from 1995 -- shows Lorber, Lebow and Trump in discussion with Moscow's then deputy mayor, Vladimir Resin, and his staff, with Geovanis looking on from the background. Blocked numbers and 'dirt' on Clinton Lorber has already been linked to the Senate investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections. The New York Times named him earlier this month as one of the Trump family associates who spoke with Donald Trump Jr. from blocked numbers around the time of a highly scrutinized 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York. That meeting was attended by top Trump campaign advisers --- Trump Jr., the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Manafort -- and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskya, who had promised dirt on Trump's election opponent, Hillary Clinton. Lorber has not responded to multiple calls for comment. When contacted by CNN via telephone, Geovanis declined to comment on his relationship with the President or talk about the photograph said to be in the possession of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He would not disclose his location, although CNN was able to confirm he was in the Moscow area as recently as this month. Asked whether he had been approached by the committee and whether he was aware of its interest, Geovanis told CNN he had \"no comment.\" A spokeswoman for the Senate Intelligence Committee's Republican chairman, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, declined to comment on whether Geovanis was of interest to it. A spokeswoman for the committee's Democratic Vice Chair, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, also declined to comment. It's not known whether Geovanis is also of interest to the investigation into alleged Russian election meddling by special counsel Robert Mueller. The President's legal team declined to comment on his relationship to Geovanis. A lawyer for the Trump Organization also declined to comment. A tower that never got built Geovanis was quoted by the Moscow Times in 1996 as saying officials were \"very receptive\" to the original Trump Tower project, but Trump's early designs on the Moscow skyline never got off the ground. Discussions two decades later to build another Trump Tower in the Russian capital have been a focal point in the Mueller investigation. Trump has often denied that his dealings with Russia continued into the 2016 campaign. Even in late 2018 Trump tweeted he \"never met a single Russian official.\" It is not clear what prompted the Senate Intelligence Committee's interest in Geovanis. But multiple sources familiar with its activities tell CNN their inquiries date back to spring last year when it sent him a letter requesting he give evidence. The sources say he has not yet done so but added that he had appointed US legal counsel. Lebow and Lorber changed their company name from Brooke Group to Vector Group, a Nasdaq-listed cigarette and real estate company. Vector Group's top three shareholders include Renaissance Technologies, the hedge fund once run by Robert Mercer, the conservative donor who was once a patron of business and political ventures of Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist. A spokeswoman for Vector did not reply to CNN's emails requesting comment. A fax to BSL Capital, Lebow's family firm, went unanswered, despite an assistant confirming it had been received. Geovanis, who married a Russian woman, obtained a Russian passport in 2014. He was last seen by family members in the US in early 2017 after the death of his mother.     He is not believed to have returned to the US since then, and his decision to remain in Moscow means US congressional investigators can't easily find out what he knows.     In 2017 Geovanis was reemployed by Lebow to set up the Russian arm of another venture, Somerset Coal International, an energy technology company which claims to \"clean\" coal by washing it at high pressure. Among those approached by Geovanis for investment was Deripaska, the billionaire metals and mining magnate, for whom Geovanis worked in the mid-2000s, according to a person familiar with Somerset Coal's business plan, speaking on condition of anonymity. Deripaska is so closely aligned with Russian President Vladimir Putin that the US sanctioned him and his companies in order to punish the Russian government for its activities around the 2016 election. The Trump administration lifted sanctions on three of those companies last month. A spokesperson for Deripaska did not return CNN's requests for comment.","59":" (CNN)Adapted from \"The Chief: The Life and Turbulent Times of Chief Justice John Roberts\" by Joan Biskupic. Copyright \u00a9 2019. Available from Basic Books. Chief Justice John Roberts arrived at the Valletta campus of the University of Malta on July 3, 2012, to teach a class on Supreme Court history. As he emerged from the back seat of a black sedan, he held his brown leather briefcase in front of him, almost as a shield. He wore a blue blazer, striped button-down shirt, and tan khakis. His clothes looked crisp, though his face was haggard. He was as exhausted and distressed as he had been in years.  Roberts had left behind a storm in Washington over his opinion upholding President Barack Obama's health-care overhaul -- the Affordable Care Act -- a stunning validation of Obama's signature domestic achievement that transformed public perceptions of the chief justice.  Republicans in Congress had been fighting the law dubbed Obamacare at every turn for two years, and all the GOP presidential candidates in 2012 had vowed to repeal it. And now Roberts, a nominee of President George W. Bush, had saved it. Going forward, the chief justice would be viewed with skepticism by conservatives, despite also having taken the lead on limiting racial remedies and voting rights, helping roll back campaign finance regulations and voting for stronger Second Amendment gun rights.  Roberts' moves behind the scenes were as extraordinary as his ruling. He changed course multiple times. He was part of the majority of justices who initially voted in a private conference to strike down the individual insurance mandate -- the heart of the law -- but he also voted to uphold an expansion of Medicaid for people near the poverty line. Two months later, Roberts had shifted on both.  The final tallies, 5-4 to uphold the individual mandate and 7-2 to curtail the Medicaid plan, came after weeks of negotiations and trade-offs among the justices. The ACA, signed by Obama in 2010, followed decades of failed attempts in Washington to control spiraling medical costs and provide Americans with higher-quality health care. It created a marketplace where the uninsured could buy coverage and protected people from being unable to get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer and other chronic illnesses. To support the system and draw in the healthy as well as the sick, the law required that most uninsured people obtain coverage (the \"individual mandate\") or pay a penalty, to be collected as part of an individual's annual taxes -- a provision critical to the final ruling. The law also expanded Medicaid benefits to a wider range of needy individuals. The money for about 90% of that expansion would come from the federal government. But it would come with a strict condition: If states did not broaden their programs as dictated they would lose all Medicaid funds. RELATED: Why Trump can't count on the Supreme Court to kill Obamacare The first meeting -- 5-4 against the mandate After an unusual three full days of oral arguments in late March 2012 (a typical case gets one hour on one day), the nine justices gathered in a private conference room off the chief's chambers to cast initial votes. They were alone, with no law clerks or administrative staff.  The discussion focused on the individual insurance mandate and Congress' power to regulate commerce. Roberts went first, as was the custom, laying out his views. He emphasized that he believed the Constitution's commerce clause never was intended to cover inactivity, such as the refusal to buy insurance. After the chief, conservative Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas offered their views. Like Roberts, they thought Congress' commerce authority did not cover an individual's decision to forgo -- rather than obtain -- health insurance. There were thus four immediate votes cast to invalidate the mandate. No one at the table was surprised, based on the questions during oral arguments and word from law clerks inside the building circulating intelligence among the justices' chambers.  The votes of the liberals were known, too. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, fifth in seniority, was the first to cast a vote to uphold the individual mandate. She believed Supreme Court precedent demanded the law be found constitutional. She was followed by Justice Stephen Breyer, who agreed with her. Next in seniority was conservative Samuel Alito, who cast the fifth and final vote to strike down the law. The eighth and ninth justices at the table, liberals Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, joined Ginsburg and Breyer in voting for the law as part of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce.  There was no sign on March 30, 2012, that any of the nine would defy the usual ideological and partisan alignment. That political division bothered Roberts, but he felt just as strongly about boundaries on the commerce power as the other four in the majority did.  Regarding Medicaid, all four liberals voted to uphold the program, and Roberts joined them. At the same time, he expressed some tentativeness.  No vote had been taken related to congressional taxing power. It did not seem to matter, because the individual mandate was going to be struck down. The only uncertainty was whether any of Obamacare would survive.  Roberts did not want the entire law to fall. A pro-business conservative, he understood the importance of the insurance industry to US businesses, and he was genuinely concerned about invalidating an entire law that had been approved through the democratic process to solve the intractable health care problem.  But his four fellow conservatives believed that if the individual mandate was going down, it should take the whole law with it. They believed all the pieces were interlocked. Roberts thought the individual mandate was entwined with only two other provisions, those known as the \"community rating\" and \"guaranteed issue.\" The community-rating section prevented insurers from charging some individuals higher premiums than others based on health status. The guaranteed-issue section required insurers to cover people regardless of pre-existing conditions.  As was his prerogative as chief justice, Roberts chose to write the majority opinion, giving him the ability to shape what the court would ultimately say. Senior liberal justice Ginsburg was ready to write for the dissenting foursome.   Soon after, Roberts began trying to persuade Kennedy to find that the unconstitutional insurance requirement could be severed from the rest of the law. But Kennedy -- often a swing vote on high-profile cases -- was firm in his position. He was puzzled, and then put off, by Roberts' view that the ACA provisions could be severed.    The deal is struck  Later in April, Roberts tried another path. He began exploring whether, as the Obama administration had argued, the individual mandate could be upheld as a tax. (CBS's Jan Crawford reported earlier on Roberts' reversal on the mandate, but the full story of Roberts' switch, including on Medicaid expansion, and the changed votes of two liberal justices is detailed now for the first time.) The chief justice then turned to Breyer and Kagan, the liberals most likely to work with him on contentious issues, to see if they could find common ground. At the same time, Roberts began incorporating arguments that would invalidate the Medicaid expansion. This was a strange turn. None of the lower courts that had taken up the ACA had rejected the Medicaid expansion, and it wasn't seen as controversial in terms of constitutional debate and public controversy.  Roberts posited in a draft opinion that Congress had in effect held \"a gun to the head\" of the states by conditioning all Medicaid money on the expanded coverage. Yet he was not prepared to find that the expansion had to be scrapped altogether, only that states could not be forced to join through the leverage of losing all Medicaid funding. Breyer and Kagan had voted in the private March conference to uphold the new Medicaid requirement, and their votes had been unequivocal. But they were pragmatists. If there was a chance that Roberts would cast the critical vote to uphold the central plank of Obamacare -- and negotiations in May were such that they still considered that a shaky proposition -- they were willing to meet him partway.  When Ginsburg found out about Roberts' new position, her first thought was, \"It ain't over till it's over.\" She understood that the process could continue to be fluid, especially in such a monumental case.  \"People change their minds about what they thought. So it isn't at all something extraordinary, and that's how it should work. We're in the process of trying to persuade each other and then the public,\" she told me in a 2012 interview in her chambers.  At the time, Ginsburg knew that Roberts was not deviating from his view of limited commerce clause power, and she wanted to make her dissent as persuasive as possible.  \"I was forcing myself to stay awake and work on the opinion,\" Ginsburg said.   Another complication for Ginsburg was that in late spring she had fallen on the marble floor of her bathroom and cracked several ribs. There was nothing to be done except to work through the pain.  Scalia and the other conservatives were livid at the development. Scalia believed the taxing-power possibility had never truly been discussed in court, calling it a \"fly-by-night briefing.\" Kennedy thought Roberts had presented his interpretation as \"judicial modesty,\" when it amounted instead \"to a vast judicial overreaching.\" The announcement The decision was revealed on June 28, the last courtroom sitting of the 2011-12 session. As Roberts began reading his opinion from the bench, he tried to speak steadily, but he was nervous. About 13 minutes into the 20-minute announcement, after he had summarized various legal rationales, he misstated the overall judgment. Few noticed the slip because he had already laid out the reasoning.  As Roberts spoke, he occasionally looked out at the spectators. Among them was retired Justice John Paul Stevens, who later said he thought the chief had shown integrity. \"He had to be thinking he did the right thing,\" Stevens said in a 2016 interview in his chambers, \"because he certainly made himself very unpopular\" with the conservatives. Perhaps Roberts' move was born of a concern for the business of health care. Perhaps he had worries about his own legitimacy and legacy, intertwined with concerns about the legitimacy and legacy of the court. Perhaps his change of heart really arose from a sudden new understanding of congressional taxing power. However the chief would explain it -- and he has not explained it beyond his written opinion -- the case added a new dimension to a man who insisted that he always decided cases based on the law. Viewed only through a judicial lens, his moves were not consistent, and his legal arguments were not entirely coherent. But he brought people and their different interests together. His moves may have been good for the country at a time of division and a real crisis in health care, even as they engendered, in the years since, anger, confusion and distrust. Criticism on the right -- from insiders and outsiders -- was swift, including from the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which described the decision as \"shot through with confusion.\" Donald Trump, three years from launching his presidential run, went right to Twitter: \"Wow, the Supreme Court passed @ObamaCare. I guess Justice Roberts wanted to be part of Georgetown society more than anyone knew.\" Trump later added: \"John Roberts arrived in Malta yesterday. Maybe we will get lucky and he will stay there.\"","60":" (CNN)For our readers, real life doesn't have a Hollywood nickname like \"Operation Varsity Blues\" and the scandal, as it continues to unfold, isn't an abstraction. \"It's a slap in the face to the American dream and to the other kids in the Chicago Public School system,\" said Christian Badillo, the first student from his high school to be admitted to Stanford University, where he is now a senior. It's a reminder that, as graduating high school senior Mick Hashimoto put it, \"We are frustrated with what America has become.\" Hashimoto, like so many of his peers across the country, is waiting this week and beyond for the results of his own college applications.  \"The best lesson I learned there,\" wrote Liza Lockard of her time as a graduate student at Yale University, was that those \"who come from extraordinary privilege\" were \"no smarter, or no more talented than I was.\" And \"because of what it took for me to get there\" -- Lockard, now a professor in Hawaii, had battled addiction and homelessness -- \"I knew was much stronger than they were.\" For Celeste A., the university admissions process is too narrowly focused on standardized tests -- and courting the kind of privilege that breeds self-doubt in too many other hard-working kids. Her daughter has been accepted to prestigious universities, but still questions whether she is \"smart enough.\" Chris H., who worked his way through an Ivy League school in his 20s, now says that degree \"has been worth very little.\" For artist Aimee Manion, college felt like a bait-and-switch for which she was unprepared; on the far side of it, \"student loan debt shaped the course of my life.\"  Badillo, Hashimoto, Lockard, Celeste, Chris and Manion are six of the hundreds of CNN Opinion readers who shared their stories in response to a question we posed as part of an op-ed by David Perry, a longtime scholar and journalist with expertise on disability issues. Perry deemed the scandal \"just the tip of the iceberg\" in terms of the gross inequalities perpetuated by the systems of higher education in America. He also noted the potentially devastating rebound effects of the scandal on students with disabilities in particular; \"alleged criminals like these\" risk making \"disability accommodation\" into \"a battle between student and suspicious professor, rather than a process of community building and inclusion.\" The college admissions scheme hits many of us -- parents, students, teachers, citizens -- in places where we are vulnerable. For some, it's because you believe in fair play or have been made to feel less than at school or at work. For others, it's that you have been or have raised the kid who went sleepless to earn those extra points on an assignment. Or you just grew up watching \"Full House\" or \"Desperate Housewives\" and can't look at Lori Loughlin or Felicity Huffman the same way on your screens, or -- like reader Hosniya Zarabi -- still remember the moment you got the \"big envelope\" from the college of your dreams and now wonder what it all meant. Whatever your perspective, a lot of illusions died last week. The full toll of the charges of fraud and bribery and the further events and revelations they have touched off won't be known for a long time to come. Thank you to all the readers who weighed in. Here is a sampling of your responses. Some have been lightly edited for clarity and flow. Stanford senior: This is a slap in the face to the American dream Like many other working-class families around the country, my parents told me that if I worked hard in high school, I could gain access to opportunities that were unavailable to all previous generations of our family. College was a foreign concept to them, but I truly believed what they told me. I worked hard, applied to Stanford University my senior year, and got in despite no one in my high school getting in before. I was lucky enough that out of the stack of admissions applications they received, they chose mine out of the pile. Many other people worked just as hard or harder than I had with less opportunities, and it felt bitter sweet to be chosen.  I am now a senior at Stanford and have seen the disparities between those who had opportunities and those who didn't. These differences manifest themselves in many ways and it is disappointing to say the least. But what's even more disappointing is knowing that among my peers are those who cut in line; those who prevented other first-generation, low-income students who worked just as hard or harder than I had from getting in, just because they had money. It's a slap in the face to the American dream and to the other kids in the Chicago Public School system who believed what their parents told them. It makes me question the value of the degree I will receive this June, and it hurts me to my core that other parents who worked hard like mine to see their kids go to a school like Stanford won't be in attendance. Christian Badillo, Palo Alto, CA   High school senior: We are frustrated with what America has become I am currently a senior in high school, I and all my peers await on college decisions as March rolls by us. The last four years of work and dedication for some of us means that we will be attending higher education. As early decisions have already come out, a lot of being crushed by getting rejected by our dream schools. We ask ourselves whether or not the decisions we have made in the last four years were correct or not. We ask whether there were times when we could've worked a little harder. We begin to question the meaning of it all under the devastation of not getting to a dream we have all dreamed of. It's the current societal pressure in part that forces all of us to look through college rankings and make sure to get into the big-name schools. In the midst of the depressive states of some of our peers though, many are delighted to hear that the college of our dreams accepted us. But once again, societal greed shows that for some, it wasn't the hard work that has gotten us into the schools. It's the bribery and fraud. Again, we question whether or not the decisions we made were the correct decisions.  I was born into a middle-class family like many Americans but am fortunate to be able to go to a well-funded public school. The American education system needs reform. American teachers are not paid enough. Some schools only open for four days because they don't have enough funding. We categorize all these schools as public so all Americans can be educated, but the education we receive is not all the same. In the midst of that, the top 1% cheat the system to avoid the poorly funded schools. They cheat to get into the schools we worked hard to get into. What I get from this news is that I like many others am frustrated with the system. We are frustrated with greed that clouds the American future. We are frustrated with what America has become. All I ask is for justice to be brought forth. Mick Hashimoto, Denver area, Colorado   I still remember the \"big envelope\" -- and how hard it was to get it Reminiscing about the day I received my early acceptance to Stanford. My dad handed me \"the big envelope\" when I came home, and though it had the word \"congratulations\" written on it in bold letters, I still hesitated about its contents and ran to my room to open it in private. It was one of the happiest moments of my and my family's life, a moment made even sweeter given the sheer time and effort I'd dedicated to this goal growing up. Looking back, I frequently slept little in high school, juggling numerous extracurriculars, AP classes, and independent projects, as I did during my intern year in neurosurgery residency. Growing up in the Bay Area with many driven peers (most of whom were immigrants like myself or children of immigrants), the competition was stiff, and despite our efforts, near perfect SAT scores and 4.5+ GPAs, there was no guarantee any of us would get a coveted spot at a top-tier institution.  The news [of the admissions scam] is frustrating in that it highlights a system that many hard-working students are already familiar with -- a system where privilege, legacy, family donations and connections can easily trump a perfect application and the years and efforts it takes to build such a thing. The same is also true for graduate and medical school admissions, where spots are sometimes even tougher to come by. But I am also hopeful that this incident will encourage those students who've earned their way, especially those dealing with imposter syndrome, to feel more confident about the fact that they do indeed belong at these institutions. Hosniya Zarabi, San Francisco area, California My daughter's self-doubt makes me the angriest I was born without privilege in North Philadelphia back in 1972, when many African-American families were just beginning to make a better life. My dad did just that, finishing an apprenticeship as an architect. We \"moved on up\" like the intro to \"The Jeffersons\" said and life was much better. My parents' sacrifices paved the way for me to attend a four-year college and graduate with a STEM degree. I now own a small IT business and live a comfortable life.  I raised both of my children with similar values, which brings me to my daughter who is waiting anxiously for her college acceptance letters this month. She is graduating with a 4.3 and a 1340 SAT score, a score which she worked so hard to get -- $3500 worth of tutors which I could barely afford and many nights on Khan Academy to improve her score from 1150 to 1340. This kid has worked her butt off taking a very rigorous course load, running several clubs, Girl Scouts, public relations coordinator for the Maryland state class council ... you name it, she's doing it or trying to do it to show how \"well-rounded\" she is and what an asset she will be for any school. She's scared that her SAT score wasn't good enough, but then a couple of acceptances came in: UNC Chapel Hill, UMD-College Park and Georgia Tech.  Then the self-doubt starts. She asks me, \"Am I smart enough for these schools, Mom?\" \"Why?\" I ask. She tells me that all her friends stress about the SAT score and remark about how her score isn't that high, so how did a girl like her get into a school like Georgia Tech. Random folks on social media ask her to share her SAT score and GPA. Is it because she is black? We wonder, and it eats at us. We don't want to be the affirmative action quota. EVERYTHING is about that damned test. Our lives hang in the balance on that score. And the values that I have worked so hard to instill in my children don't matter. What matters is that SAT score. And now to find out the level of cheating going on -- it really pisses me off. I had heard rumors before this, that parents were paying tens of thousands of dollars to cheat their way into a great SAT score. So I am not surprised, but I am still pissed. Why should your acceptance to a college depend on one test taken on one day of your 12-grade career as a student? Life is so stacked against people like my daughter. We play the game and follow the rules, only to find out again that the rules are only for people like us. Celeste A., Washington, DC area  I need the accommodations that others have abused. What happens to people like me now? I have a learning disability: ADHD and a low form of Aspergers. When I was diagnosed when I was 12 years old, I was afforded every accommodation in order to get through school. I was struggling even then, but with hard work and some of the best teachers who taught me the skills I needed to succeed, I was able to get through my struggles and make it in the real world. I'm now a successful computer engineer in NYC.  When I took my SATs, I didn't get above 900 the first time and the second time I got 1000. Both times I used my accommodation of double time to take the exam because I cannot take tests. My fellow peers and others who have the same situation as me are now going to have a harder time getting the time they need to get those SAT scores to get into schools, perhaps trying to get into a top-flight school if they have the grades to prove it. I am afforded this accommodation in my adult life when I have to take tests and other things that are timed because I need it in order to succeed. I would not be where I am today or where I want to go in the future without this accommodation. I feel like it's now going to be harder to prove that I need it in the wake of the scandal. This hurts me to the core of my soul. Shane F., Brooklyn, New York   The best lesson I ever learned at Yale was about myself I was the unlikeliest of candidates to attend college: I was kicked out of my home in my teens, graduated from high school in the bottom quintile of my class, subsequently became addicted to drugs and found myself homeless for a spell. However, nine years later I was accepted into a master's program at any Ivy League school with a half-tuition scholarship. That had never been an explicit goal for me, but my dismal circumstances drove me to forge a better life for myself -- even more so than had I come from a supportive upbringing. I worked hard to turn my life around, and against overwhelming odds, got accepted to Yale and Columbia. I ultimately chose to attend Yale. I did not have any connections or money, nor could I brag of an illustrious academic history or exceptional accomplishments. But I never hid my dismal past in my application either; I, in fact, owned it, because it was what made me unique apart from everyone else. I was proud to have overcome the formidable obstacles in my path, because if nothing else, I possessed incredible tenacity, perseverance and resilience. The first few days at Yale, I admit, were terrifying. I found out that I was the only student in my program who had ever waited on tables to earn a living; most of my classmates had never had to work before. There seemed to be a collective fascination with exotic classmates who hailed from wealthy faraway countries; I, on the other hand, had much more admiration for students who came from places like Paramus, New Jersey or Chicago's South Side. I witnessed what life was like for those who come from extraordinary privilege, and despite my early intimidation, eventually came to discover that they were no smarter, or no more talented than I was. But because of what it took for me to get there, I knew I was much stronger than they were. Best lesson I ever learned there. Liza Lockard, Honolulu, Hawaii   Student loan debt shaped the course of my life. Kids need to know what this system can do to them I graduated from high school in 2001 in a really incredible school district in the suburbs of southwestern Pennsylvania. Most of my classmates lived in expensive new homes in gated communities. Out of 1,500 students, there were only three kids who weren't white. And everyone went to college. Everyone. It was just what you were supposed to do after graduation. Well, my family was middle-class, so my parents couldn't afford to pay our tuition. But my dad was an engineer and above the threshold for me to get any financial aid. So I took out several high interest loans to finance my education myself. The amount of debt I accumulated was overwhelming. I went into severe depression for many years because of the daunting amount of debt I owed. I had no idea what I was getting into when I was 18 and making these huge financial life decisions ... I've basically been paying a high-interest mortgage for twelve years, with eight more to go.  Student loan debt shaped the course of my life. Because of my debt, I couldn't do normal things like buy a car or a house, go on vacation or generate savings. I was living check to check, in hopeless depression. I'm 35 now and finally just bought a house. I am married, but I don't plan on ever having kids. How could I afford kids when I still have my student loans and a mortgage to pay?! I'll be 43 years old when my student loans are finally paid, and I don't want to become a mother in my mid-40s. My degrees are in fine art and biological anthropology. While I loved school and love learning, the degrees themselves are pretty useless to me. I am currently a professional artist and a bartender -- both jobs I could do without a degree. I always say that I should have majored in business, because as an artist I am an entrepreneur.  My biggest gripe about my situation is the lack of education I received about student loans, debt, and college. Why don't they teach you these things in high school? We need a class to teach young kids about money -- loans, interest, taxes, credit scores, how to buy a car or home, all of these big important things we will face once we become adults. Why are we letting ignorant young kids make huge financial decisions that will affect the rest of their lives? Education is becoming more expensive, and college is not necessary for success. It's not for everyone. If I knew the amount of debt I was accumulating and knew how much interest I would pay over time, I never would have gone to college. We are doing a disservice to young students, and it's affecting our economy in the long run. My entire generation has postponed buying houses and having kids -- instead of putting our money into the economy, we are putting it into the pockets of private banks. We are becoming indentured servants to a system we didn't understand when we were forced to make these financial decisions. Things need to change. Aimee Manion, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania   My son is the first to attend college and I know he understands true success My grandparents didn't attend college, my parents didn't attend college, my brothers and I, no college. So it was such a proud moment the day my only son began his college career! Learning of these despicable people and practices makes me even more angry when I remember how upset my son was at being denied entrance to his first choices. Looks like all those spots were bought, not earned. It's disheartening for these kids that they have helicopter parents who never believe in their abilities, have no faith in them and will buy their futures. They're buying their failure. And they've taken away from so many others to feed their selfish needs. I'm proud that my son earns every grade, feels every achievement, and knows how to rebound from a loss. That's true success. Heather B., Noblesville, Indiana   My Ivy League degree let me down My Ivy League degree has been worth very little. It has led me to observe that most opportunities afforded to persons with elite degrees depends on who you know, and who you know depends on how much money you're born with. My education was interrupted in my 20s after both of my parents died. I had to stop going to school and start working for a living. I was fortunate enough to eventually secure a job at an Ivy League university located in the heart of a major city. Among the benefits is a generous tuition benefit package that permitted me, over the span of seven years, to complete my B. A. in 2013. My attempts at using my degree to further my career has been an eye-opener.  After I left employment with the school I earned my degree from and moved to a different city, I was only able to secure a job that paid $20,000 a year less -- despite the prestige carried by my diploma and an uninterrupted 17-year work history of promotion to positions of increasing responsibility. I returned to my former employer after four years -- to a position that paid scarcely more than the one I left, even after negotiation. My experience of job prospects as an experienced adult in the workplace with an Ivy League degree differs sharply from the paths of the younger, wealthier students who shared the same classrooms with me. They were armed with the latest top-end MacBook Pro computers, sometimes carried in Kenneth Cole or Michael Kors bags, and the talk among them was of which of their father's friend's firms they were going to intern at during the summer. It is perfectly obvious to me that socioeconomic background is the biggest factor in educational and post-education outcomes after more than 20 years as a higher education professional and seven as a recent student. Chris H., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  My acceptance was built, not bought As someone who is busy applying for scholarships and pitching myself to high net worth individuals so I can afford the tuition at Cornell University-Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island, this struck a nerve. Initially I had a pity party: \"Poor me, too poor to go to an Ivy League school and I have to beg for money.\" Then I realized, that I have secured my place all on my own merit, me, a girl from Africa who was raised by a single father. I had earned a place in a very selective LLM (masters of law) program that is at the cutting edge of technology and entrepreneurship -- then I felt sorry for the parents and the children. I don't want to be like them, but they want to be like me -- to be in my position and they would do anything. Yet, what they don't see and embrace is what I went through to become this person. When I was 13 I lost my mother, two brothers and our nanny when they were murdered by my uncle -- this was on September 13, 2001.  This masters degree is another building block in my life. When I was 26, I started my legal consulting firm and I was homeless for almost a year as I put the business together. These challenges have given me something that money cannot buy -- which is empathy -- and through my education and entrepreneurship my desire is to share the little bit of privilege I have with others that are often overlooked. I have started non profit organizations to help early stage entrepreneurs with actionable advice and practical tool, a social enterprise to expose women and children in mining communities to digital skills.  My acceptance into Cornell has been built, not bought. I owe it to all my traumas and the single father that raised me -- in what I thought was a laissez-faire manner, because he didn't helicopter me. He provided an environment for me to discover my interests, he paid for everything I needed so I could do what I want and he was constantly there to listen, love and guide from the periphery. Although it seems terrible that the scheme has been exposed, it could be an opportunity to develop character, something too many have discounted for so long. The parents have not modeled leadership well for their children up to this point. Tiyani Majoko, Johannesburg, South Africa Maybe my son will get a fairer shake now that this scandal is national news My son is a junior and attends an all-boys private Catholic high school for which I have worked up to three jobs at a time to pay for. I have always told him that he has to work hard and can't slack off like some of his classmates can because whether they do well or not their parents can and will buy them into schools and jobs. This kind of behavior is very well known to the less privileged and especially those of us in the African American community. I and others are not surprised by this, I'm more surprised that a bunch of the wealthy and entitled got caught. My son is about to start applying to colleges ... maybe he'll actually get a fair shake now that this behavior has come to the national spotlight. One can hope. Shannon Faulk, Newark, Delaware   These people have no idea what it is to struggle to get an education I am 40-year-old immigrant, a single mother, and a survivor of domestic violence. For many years, I paid for my classes out of my pocket because I was undocumented and I could not apply for financial aid. It has been a long journey. I am a government major at Suffolk University in Boston. Finally, I graduate in May.  Suffolk first put my application on hold and asked me to go to a community college because they were afraid that I would not handle the workload of a full time student. I graduated from Bunker Hill Community College with a 3.8 GPA. I transferred to Suffolk and I showed them that I was capable. My current GPA is 3.5. My GPA dropped in the semester I lost my father, otherwise it would be higher than that. I work extremely hard. I study hours into the night and weekends. In order to attend school full time, I work two days as a housekeeper making just enough money to eat and barely pay my bills. One night, after returning from school, I found my apartment dark. The electricity was disconnected. I had been saving all my money to pay rent. My daughter asked me why we did not have electricity. Quickly, a statement I read in a T.D. Jakes' book came to mind. He said that he had been in the same situation and he told his kids that that night was a tent night and to grab the flash lights and have some fun. That was my answer to my daughter and she loved it. That night, I cried myself to sleep, but I told myself: \"It's better to sleep without lights than sleep without a roof over my head.\" The struggle goes on and on, but I never give up. My child needs an educated mother. I am heading to law school next year. We Latinos and single parents do have a chance to be admitted to an Ivy League school, but our chances could be stripped away by students who are cheating the system. If I -- a person who barely has time to study -- can get good grades, why couldn't they? They have money to attend private schools their whole life and hire all types of tutors. Why are they cheating the system? These people have no idea what it is to struggle to access a higher education. Luciana Silva, Arlington, MA   Their stories of privilege make me laugh. I know it can all be gone in a moment I actually have a unique story, because I grew up in an upper middle class family, only to have my world come crashing down when I was in college after my father was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. When he died my junior year, he left a wife and four kids behind, and I had no idea how I was going to afford the private school I was attending. My academic scholarship, in addition to a specialized anonymous grant (specific to kids who lose their parents and persevere to graduation) were what allowed me to graduate, although I was not emotionally or mentally fully present the following year and a half.  Since graduation, I have had to fully support myself while my other peers (who come from my wealthy community back home) get to travel, live in fancy apartments and have extra money to buy nice things with the help from their parents. At 25, I remind myself that my journey is not like theirs, so it doesn't bother me until I think about my future and how my plans are becoming increasingly harder to achieve due to lack of privilege and my setbacks. I dream of going back to school to become an art therapist for children with cancer. I cannot fathom adding to my loans, going back to college to pause my decently small paycheck for no paycheck, or being able to afford to live in a new city with more possibility than mine.  I hear these stories of wealth and I laugh because I know firsthand that you can lose it all in a heartbeat and our American systems fail to appreciate the value of hard work and perseverance over privilege. Still, I am hopeful that someday it will all work out for me and for many others who work hard to make ends meet and keep their dreams alive despite all the setbacks. Erika Krenn, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania   A first generation college graduate's journey  I am a first generation college graduate. My journey towards higher education is a story of service, community development and environmental conservation. It all began when I was 22 years old, after I enrolled in a partnership program between the California Conservation Corps (CCC) and AmeriCorps, service learning programs developed to serve communities and develop youth. I worked on conservation and trail building projects across California. Both of these programs provided scholarships based on the amount of hours I completed within my program. I used these scholarships to enroll in a community college. I began by taking remedial math and English classes. These classes are no longer required since placement tests traditionally used by colleges tend to \"under-place\" a significant portion of students.  After earning enough credits and obtaining an associates degree in transfer studies, I transferred to Humboldt State University and completed my BA in geography with a minor in natural resources and planning. During this time, I worked seasonally for the US Forest Service and as a research assistant for a professor on climate change studies and bark beetle migration. After completing my degree, I was accepted into the US Peace Corps to serve as a community based natural resource manager. After completing my Peace Corps service, I received a fellowship and continued my education by earning a masters degree in sustainable development at the School for International training. Alysia Ballinger, Willits, California  I'm a mother and an SAT tutor. Colleges need to face reality My son worked every day for years to get into MIT. He decided in 9th grade, when he visited the university. It was his decision. He gave up having fun and friends. He gave up every weekend, holiday and vacation for four years to earn the right qualifications. He entered and won academic contests. As a student athlete he gave up all his free time to be good enough for consideration. I was in awe of my son and his discipline and effort, and I supported every step but never ran the show or suggested any illegal or immoral actions. The actions of these parents cheapens my son's real efforts.  As a tutor for the SAT and ACT, I see people all the time with false ideas and hopes about what it takes to be in the top 1% of students nationwide. It is a calling and a full time job. It is a huge struggle, a grinding commitment, and for the parents, an expensive, heart-wrenching gamble to fund the effort.  These institutions that are seeing mediocre students get in, then not fail out, certainly must be systematically supporting them in some way. My son learned how truly elite a student must be to rightfully earn a place at a top tier university, and it is unbelievably difficult. It is also wearing out young people and creating the atmosphere we live in today.  This kind of competition is not healthy for anyone, let alone a young person. University admissions teams must do more to work together to stop this kind of crime, that cheapens everyone around them. But they also should take a hard look at the ridiculous standards they are holding young persons to, and place a cap on admissions expectations or young people will continue to exhaust themselves and cheaters will continue to cheat. I work with young hopefuls every day. Let me tell you, the damage to the mental health of our young people is a major contributing factor to the downfall of our country.

So far it's been the same in Congress, where she's using her star power to turn ordinarily dry hearings into viral, must-see TV. This week her target -- well, one of them -- was campaign finance. Seated at a big leather chair, she went on the attack like she was back on the stump, whipping through a fierce argument about Washington's influence machinery that got retweeted and described as \"just sensational\" by late-night host James Corden. By Friday afternoon, she was getting invited to watch the Grammys with Chrissy Teigen, who called her \"my hero.\" The episodes capped a week that started with Ocasio-Cortez being photographed striding into the House chamber for the State of the Union, wearing a white cape that appeared to awe a group of starstruck young men.  She then debuted the Green New Deal resolution, her first major legislative proposal, alongside Sen. Ed Markey -- a Massachusetts Democrat who's been in Congress for longer than she's been alive. The launch further stoked a suddenly riveting debate over climate change and jobs programs, which landed on the front page of The New York Times. While the fate of the Green New Deal remains a long way off, Ocasio-Cortez has consistently defied critics from both parties who at times seem to be tripping over each other to question her tactics, especially her aggressive use of social media. Ocasio-Cortez's communications director and longtime aide, Corbin Trent, said the Bronx-born congresswoman has no plans to change -- that Twitter and Instagram were key tools for galvanizing the public support that ultimately inspired a handful of the party's top presidential hopes to back the resolution. \"The way she operates, whether it's to come up with lines of questioning or lines of messaging, or how to present things to her constituents or to the American people or to the party -- it's continuous listening and talking,\" Trent told CNN. \"When she using social media, that is essentially a practice run and a conversation that she's working and developing.\"   It's a long way from November, when she spent part of her first official visit to Washington joining a sit-in of now-Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, where young activists from the Sunrise Movement gathered to agitate for urgent climate action. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said Ocasio-Cortez represents \"a classic story of how somebody gets assimilated into the institution while preserving all their values and desires for change.\"  \"I think it's been a wonderful transition to see someone go from being a full-time activist to being a legislator and an activist,\" he said.  Pelosi's relationship with Ocasio-Cortez has, to date, been mutually beneficial. Ocasio-Cortez helped secure the California liberal's left flank amid a leadership challenge. Pelosi, even while denying the New Yorker a new select committee assignment that would have been dedicated specifically to shaping the Green New Deal, offered her a seat on a different climate panel.  Ocasio-Cortez turned down the offer, citing the time she needed to manage her other assignments. Their relationship now is less a fight than a dance. Asked on Thursday about Pelosi's description, in a Politico report, of the Green New Deal as \"the green dream or whatever they call it,\" Ocasio-Cortez passed up a chance to land a jab. \"No, it is a green dream,\" she told reporters. \"I don't consider that to be a dismissive term.\"   Even as her profile -- and influence -- rises, Ocasio-Cortez operates much as she did on the campaign trail. During a visit to the Midwest last summer to stump for other progressive hopefuls, Ocasio-Cortez would unleash her fire at the mic but then move quietly backstage at events, jotting in her notebook, constantly updating her speech with a new line or idea.  \"What we're seeing is that there is not one single way to get things done,\" Trent said. \"She was saying today, everybody says this is the way things are done in Washington and there certainly is a way things have been done in Washington, and there are certainly people who are going to continue to work that way. And I'm sure they'll be able to get things done. But there are also other paths.\" Rep. Brenda Lawrence said Ocasio-Cortez and other new members who came in as activists are learning how to operate in a deliberative body.  \"It's one thing to protest. It's another to pass laws and bills and actually impact lives and make a difference,\" said Lawrence, a third-term Michigan Democrat who co-chairs the bipartisan Women's Caucus. \"So she's at the beginning of that. And I'm excited. She's going to have some growth and some bumps in the road.\" \"Every step is growth,\" she added. \"She has such a large media platform, which I pray continues to be a positive one and continues to be one of the boldness of speaking truth to power.\" ","62":" (CNN)Democrats spent Thursday sorting through a torrent of information about potential fraud and other crimes provided in hours of gripping public testimony from President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen. Much of that detail was generated by sharp, efficient questioning from some of the party's freshest faces -- not just prominent freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez but also her peer Rep. Katie Hill and second-termers Rep. Ro Khanna and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi. Those lawmakers -- along with one Republican whose pointed questions set him apart from the rest of his party -- told CNN significant preparation went into their questioning, including poring over Oversight committee resources, getting briefings from the committee staff, and consulting with outside experts, family members and colleagues about how best to elicit information during the blockbuster hearing.  In congressional hearings, lawmakers often opt for a variety of approaches: some deliver speeches in an attempt to get a point across, others hammer down on a specific point of interest, and still others try to fit as many questions as possible in their limited allotted time. On Wednesday, this group of Democrats proved some strategies are more effective than others.   Krishnamoorthi said he put a lot of time into preparation. \"I got up at 4:00 in the morning and just read everything I could,\" he said. \"We'd been working on the outline for a couple of days. It's interesting how long you're working on an outline for just five minutes of questioning.\"  In preparing for the hearing, Khanna, a lawyer, said he turned to an old friend, former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti, who is now a legal analyst for CNN.  \"Renato was a law school roommate of mine and he knows everything about these hearings,\" Khanna told CNN on Thursday. \"I spent a good amount of time talking to him. He's a former prosecutor and so he said, speak less, ask more questions, speak slowly, don't give a long preamble, don't be a politician.\"  That approach elicited one of the most notable interactions during Cohen's appearance. Khanna's questions led Cohen to openly accuse Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr., and Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg of committing fraud by repaying Cohen for $130,000 in hush money given during the presidential campaign to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006.  \"Are you telling us, Mr. Cohen, that the President directed transactions in conspiracy with Allen Weisselberg and his son Donald Trump Jr. as part of a criminal conspiracy of financial fraud. Is that your testimony today?\" Khanna asked.  \"Yes,\" Cohen replied. Asked whether he knew if the matter, which Khanna described as \"garden variety financial fraud,\" was being investigated by the Southern District of New York, Cohen declined to answer because \"it could be part of investigations currently ongoing.\"   Mariotti said the best congressional questioners save time by cutting out long speeches at the beginning of their five minutes and avoid interrupting witnesses while they answer questions.  Both Mariotti and Khanna cited freshman Ocasio-Cortez's approach as a success during Wednesday's hearing.  \"Ocasio did really well, again, in asking questions and establishing a basis for the taxes,\" Khanna said when asked whose questioning stuck out to him the most. The congresswoman used her time late in the hearing to build on the case for subpoenaing Trump's tax returns, asking Cohen to confirm reports about Trump deflating the value of his assets to avoid paying more in real estate taxes.  She also asked follow-up questions designed to identify other potential witnesses -- \"Who else knows that the President did this?\" -- and received a clear result when Cohen pointed to Weisselberg and two other Trump associates. In an interview Thursday with CNN, Ocasio-Cortez credited the Oversight committee staff for helping prepare members for the hearing, She added that as a freshman, her time to speak came later than more senior members, which meant she tailored her approach based on what had already been discussed. \"You prepare a lot, but then you also have to be very adaptable during the actual process,\" she said in a hallway interview on Thursday. Ocasio-Cortez also returned Khanna's compliment by singling out his performance. \"Representative Khanna had an amazing line of questioning,\" she told CNN. \"I don't think what he did is getting talked about enough.\"  Republicans, many of whom ceded their time during the hearing to ranking member Jim Jordan, primarily avoided conversations that could be damaging to Trump and attacked Cohen's character. Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison for tax fraud, bank fraud, and campaign finance violations, and he has admitted to lying to Congress in previous testimony. But Republican Rep. Justin Amash, a libertarian who often splits with the rest of his party, stood out. First giving a disclaimer that he wasn't sure whether to trust Cohen, Amash asked a question that left Cohen nearly speechless: \"What is the truth that you know President Trump fears most?\" \"That's a tough question, sir,\" Cohen replied after some thought. \"I don't have an answer for that one.\" Amash told CNN on Thursday he didn't coordinate with his fellow Republicans before the hearing, though he did inform Jordan, a fellow House Freedom Caucus member, of the general direction he would be taking.  \"It was an opportunity to conduct oversight and gather information. I believed it was best to give Mr. Cohen room to talk about his relationship with the President,\" said Amash. \"My staff and I drafted some ideas based on my approach, and I asked my brothers, who also are lawyers, for suggestions. I narrowed the list of questions the night before and during the hearing.\"","63":"New York (CNN)President Donald Trump is considering new tariffs on foreign cars and auto parts, but some of the strongest opposition is coming from the industry they are meant to protect: American automakers.  In theory, the big three -- Fiat Chrysler, General Motors and Ford -- could stand to benefit if tariffs are put on foreign vehicles. But they aren't asking for the tariffs, which carmakers argue would raise the price of vehicles made in the United States and hurt sales. \"I'm not aware of any company, organization or entity that broadly supports the imposition of these tariffs,\" said former Missouri Republican Gov. Matt Blunt, who represents the three big American automakers as president of the American Automotive Policy Council.  The President, however, loves to dangle the threat of tariffs in international negotiations. He only this week backed off a threat to radically hike tariffs on consumer goods imports if he can't get a comprehensive trade deal with Beijing by March 1.  On Wednesday, during an appearance at the White House alongside visiting Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, Trump indicated that he might impose auto tariffs if he isn't happy about trade talks with the European Union.  \"It's something we think about and we're negotiating with them. If we don't make the deal we'll do the tariffs,\" Trump said.  But every corner of the auto industry -- vehicle makers, part manufacturers, and dealers -- have lined up against the proposed levies since Trump first asked for an investigation into whether imported vehicles and parts pose a threat to national security last year. The Commerce Department on Sunday delivered its findings, which could give the President the legal justification to impose the tariffs. The report has yet to be made public, but Trump has 90 days to make a decision.  Trump appeared to suggest in his comments on Wednesday that the Commerce report wouldn't be a major factor in his decision-making process.  \"The new report is not that kind of report. It's just really a study that's underway. We've studied it very carefully. We've seen the results. But the bottom line result is whether or not we can make a deal with the EU that is fair,\" he said.  The President previously used the same authority to impose tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum. But the steel industry, and at least some American aluminum producers, welcomed the protection. The tariffs, which went into effect last March, have boosted demand for American steel, while also squeezing some manufacturers who are paying higher prices for metal components they need to produce other goods.  Trump has threatened tariffs on not just foreign-made vehicles, but auto parts made abroad, too. That's why American automakers, who use imported parts in almost every model, say the cost of production would go up.   \"There is nothing good that comes out of this, even for the domestic industry. There are going to be spillover effects all over the supply chain,\" said Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox Automotive, which runs Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader. In a worst-case scenario, the tariffs could raise the price of an American-made vehicle by an average of $2,750, according to a report released this month by the Center for Automotive Research. The study says that the bigger price tag could lead to a dip in sales and job losses. Foreign companies that have plants in the United States, including major players like BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen, are also against the proposed tariffs. Some of the cars they make in the United States are shipped back to Europe, and sales of those models could dampen if the price goes up. BMW, which has its largest plant worldwide in South Carolina, has called for removing US and EU auto duties entirely.  There is also a fear that countries could put retaliatory tariffs in place on cars assembled in the United States that are shipped overseas. A BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report warned Wednesday that \"full-blown tit-for-tat auto tariffs could trigger a global recession.\" The uncertainty itself is a problem for automakers, and could stifle foreign investment in the American industry, said John Bozzella, president and CEO of Global Automakers, a trade association that represents international automakers operating in the United States.  Steel and aluminum tariffs have already raised the price of manufacturing, and it's unclear how long they will remain in place. The renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement, which is awaiting ratification by Congress, would also bring big changes to the auto industry by creating stricter rules of origin in order to remain duty free. But it remains uncertain if the new trade deal has enough votes to pass, given opposition from some Republicans as well as Democrats.  Automakers are eager for clues as to whether Trump will impose the new tariffs. Some analysts believe the President will use them as a threat to gain some ground with trading partners as he attempts to strike new bilateral agreements with the European Union and Japan.  A bipartisan group of lawmakers recently claimed that Trump has abused his power to impose tariffs in the interest of national security, and introduced legislation that would rein in his authority to do so.  Last week, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, called on Trump to forgo the tariffs.  \"In short, raising tariffs on cars and parts would be a huge tax on consumers who buy or service their cars, whether they are imported or domestically produced,\" Grassley said in a statement.  But there's no question the American auto industry has already made up its mind about the potential for tariffs, said Blunt. \"The tariffs would have such a negative impact on the market, I don't think there would be any winners,\" he said.","64":"Washington (CNN)Special counsel Robert Mueller on Friday unveiled the indictment of Trump ally Roger Stone, opening a new chapter in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.  The court filings shed some startling new light on how President Donald Trump's campaign allegedly eagerly tried to benefit from Russian meddling in real time.  Stone denies colluding with the Russian government and said he plans to plead not guilty and fight the charges, which include obstruction, lying to Congress and witness tampering.    Here's what we learned and how it fits into the bigger picture.  Direction from above to get WikiLeaks intel The most damning part of the 24-page indictment directly connects the highest echelon of the Trump campaign to Stone's alleged  effort to glean inside information about future WikiLeaks dumps.  It reads: \"After the July 22, 2016 release of stolen DNC emails by (WikiLeaks), a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact STONE about any additional releases and what other damaging information (WikiLeaks) had regarding the Clinton Campaign. STONE thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by (WikiLeaks).\"  This paragraph makes it clear that Mueller believes Stone was not engaged in a rogue quest to contact WikiLeaks. Rather, Stone is alleged to have coordinated some of his efforts with the Trump campaign. And someone at the tippy-top of the campaign power structure directed a \"senior\" official to ask Stone to make it happen, according to the indictment. The big question remains: Who was it?  It's unknown whether Stone's indictment is the final word on WikiLeaks or yet another building block toward a larger campaign conspiracy. If the Trump team back-channeled with WikiLeaks to schedule its releases for Trump's maximum benefit -- as has been alluded to in draft court filings obtained by CNN -- that could potentially violate campaign finance laws.  RELATED: How CNN captured video of the Roger Stone raid Stone's role with the Trump campaign An unconventional politician, Trump regularly looks to a coterie of informal advisers and friends for advice. This is true today and was a big part of his campaign -- and Stone was a key player.  Stone is an exaggerator, but during the campaign, he claimed he spoke with Trump on a near-weekly basis and was in regular contact with then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Stone said those conversations continued after Manafort resigned, and that Manafort was \"keeping in touch with a lot of friends in the campaign.\" Court filings from Mueller tell a more definitive story. The indictment says Stone \"maintained regular contact with ... the Trump Campaign through the 2016 election\" and described how he communicated with \"senior Trump Campaign officials\" about upcoming WikiLeaks releases. On at least one occasion, the campaign reached out to Stone for information about WikiLeaks, according to court filings.  Despite efforts at the time by Manafort and others to publicly dissociate Stone from the Trump campaign, Friday's indictment makes a case that Stone was \"in the fold\" with Team Trump.  They knew Russia was behind the hacks  The first words of the indictment note that Russia's responsibility for the hacks was well-known before Stone or anyone on the Trump campaign allegedly secretly sought information about WikiLeaks. The Democratic National Committee announced in June 2016 that it had been hacked and Russia was the culprit. Hillary Clinton's campaign regularly made this point, though Trump and his team repeatedly dismissed Russia's role and questioned whether there had been any hacks at all.  After that announcement, according to the indictment, Stone asked his associates to \"get to\" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and seek information. (This was around the same time that Trump publicly asked Russia to hack Clinton's emails.) Stone got word from Assange that more releases was coming in October, and relayed that tip to Trump's orbit, according to the indictment. Meanwhile, the US intelligence community publicly confirmed that Russia was trying to influence the election by leaking Democrats' private emails.  WikiLeaks soon started publishing Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's hacked emails, and a Trump campaign associate texted Stone \"well done,\" according to the indictment. Trump publicly embraced WikiLeaks and cited these leaked materials at nearly all of his campaign rallies during the closing weeks of the campaign. He went on to a stunning victory over Clinton. Mueller started closing the loop Mueller has now closed the loop between the Russian government, WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign. But he has yet to charge anyone in a grand collusion conspiracy. His 2018 indictment of Russian intelligence officers formally established how the Kremlin hacked Democratic targets and facilitated public releases through WikiLeaks. This was done to influence the US presidential election and help Trump win, per US intelligence agencies.  The Stone indictment completed the other half of the equation. It alleges ties between Trump's campaign to WikiLeaks and the email leaks that severely weakened Clinton's hand down the stretch. It's anyone's guess if Mueller will continue connecting the dots, or if this is all that's left. More indictments could be in the cards if evidence is found of additional campaign coordination with WikiLeaks or the Russians. Alternatively, this could be the extent of the \"collusion\" web. Time will tell. Mueller clearly doesn't trust Stone Stone is not the first Trump associate to face charges in the Russia investigation (he's the sixth, actually), but he is the first to be arrested by FBI agents raiding his home with guns drawn. The spectacle unfolded in Florida, but the indictment was handed up one day earlier by the special counsel's grand jury in Washington. Mueller's team asked a judge to keep it secret until Stone's arrest. They wrote: \"Law enforcement believes that publicity resulting from disclosure of the Indictment and related materials on the public record prior to arrest will increase the risk of the defendant fleeing and destroying (or tampering with) evidence. It is therefore essential that any information concerning the pending indictment in this district be kept sealed prior to the defendant's arrest.\" The request was granted. And after Stone was released Friday on $250,000 bond, he was adamant as ever, telling reporters outside the federal courthouse that he was prepared to fight the charges. And he said he would never \"bear false witness\" and testify against Trump. Stone will be arraigned Tuesday in Washington. The beginning of the end? There are a few clues suggesting that this might be the beginning of the end for Mueller. The Stone indictment offered a new clue. This is the first time where special counsel prosecutors are jointly working with prosecutors from another US attorney's office to bring a case. That could suggest that Mueller doesn't intend for his team to see the case through the trial, which could be months away, and instead hand it off to Justice Department colleagues.  A few factors are already in the ether. A few prosecutors have left Mueller's team. Mueller is already writing his final report, CNN reported in November. And the imminent departure of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is seen as a signal that Mueller could be wrapping up.

Max Stier is the president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the authors. View more opinion at CNN. The reality today is that our government suffers from a shockingly low number of young employees, a talent crisis that will deepen because of the fallout from the 35-day partial shutdown that upended critical work by many federal agencies, and left 800,000 employees demoralized and without a paycheck.  Currently, just 6% of the roughly 2 million permanent, full-time federal employees are under the age of 30, a number that has declined from 9% since 2010. Attracting new motivated talent is the lifeblood of any organization, and the federal government is no different. In the private sector, about 21% of all employees are under 30, and at some companies such as Goldman Sachs and the technology firms in Silicon Valley, the numbers of employees in their 20's are well in excess of 50%. As young people are shunning government, the federal workforce is aging, with 45% over the age of 50, and 32% who were on the payroll at the start of fiscal 2018 eligible to retire in 2022.  The world is changing dramatically along with the nature of work and the types of skills needed in the workplace. The federal government -- the one institution in our democracy with the public mandate, resources and the ability to address the nation's most difficult problems -- must have the best talent available now and in the future. This includes a new generation of young people capable of functioning in a fast-changing, data- and technology-driven environment, and with expertise in such sectors as science, technology, engineering, finance, cybersecurity and health care.  There is no doubt that the recent and previous shutdowns, hiring and pay freezes, and the disparagement of government by some in public office has discouraged motivated and idealistic young individuals from federal service, and that is unfortunate. But the problems also are systemic, requiring action by Congress and the agency leaders to ensure the long-term health of our government. The federal hiring system, for example, is painfully slow, with agencies taking an average of 106 days and often longer to hire employees compared with roughly 42 days in the private sector. With new hiring halted during the shutdown, the timeline will likely be much longer for current applicants who may have become discouraged and started looking elsewhere for employment. Besides the problematic hiring process, the government tends to show a preference for experience over talent, which shuts out young people. Agencies do not make good use of student internships, bringing in only a small number of its entry-level hires through this process, while the rigidity of the personnel system does not fit in with the mobile and agile model expected by today's younger generation. Adding to these problems is a 70-year-old compensation system that makes it hard to pay employees with specialized skills anywhere close to what they could make in the private sector. Government will never be able to pay private sector salaries, but it must do better in the competition for mission-critical talent.  Congress last year passed legislation giving federal agencies the authority to bypass normal hiring procedures and more quickly bring qualified students and recent college graduates on board to fill professional and administrative positions. This could have an impact if aggressively implemented. We must deal with the long-term neglect of the civil service by enacting changes that will allow agencies to better identify the best job candidates and to speed up the selection process. We should revamp the pay structure, creating an occupation-specific, market-sensitive compensation system to better reflect the broader labor market for skilled professionals.  Agency leaders also must make full use of internship programs to assess and hire top talent, engage subject matter experts to proactively recruit and evaluate applicants, and develop a stronger presence on college campuses. Finally, Congress must permanently resolve the current budget crisis, fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year and make sure we stop the regular threat of shutting our government. It's time for our government to develop better talent pipelines and make itself more attractive for a new generation of motivated young professionals who can bring in fresh ideas and help our country address its biggest challenges. The shutdown crisis will make that job more difficult, but it also should create a new sense of urgency and a commitment from our nation's leaders to reach out to the younger generation and find ways to bring them on board. ","66":"London (CNN Business)Banks and other financial companies are shifting more assets and jobs out of the United Kingdom as the country lurches towards Brexit.  Financial services companies in Britain have announced plans to move \u00a31 trillion ($1.3 trillion) into the European Union, according to consultancy EY. That's up from an earlier estimate of \u00a3800 billion ($1.1 trillion). Many banks have set up new offices in Germany, France, Ireland and other EU countries to safeguard their regional business after Brexit. That means they also have to move substantial assets there to satisfy EU regulators.  Other companies are moving assets to protect their clients against the wild market swings and sudden changes in regulation that could accompany the rupture between Britain and its biggest trading partner.  The financial services industry accounts for roughly 12% of the UK economy, and employs 2.2 million people. EY has tracked 222 of the biggest financial services companies in the United Kingdom since the Brexit referendum in June 2016. It said there has been a \"steady increase\" in the number of companies announcing that they are moving employees, operations and assets in preparation for Brexit.  Lost tax revenue The number of jobs that will be relocated out of the United Kingdom in the near future stands at 7,000, according to EY. It estimates that will cost Britain at least \u00a3600 million ($794 million) in lost taxes.  EY said its estimate of assets moving to Europe was \"conservative.\" But it roughly matches the expectations of the European Central Bank. Andrea Enria, head of banking regulation at the ECB, told the Financial Times last week that the central bank expects about \u20ac1.2 trillion ($1.4 billion) of assets to be moved from Britain to the 19 EU countries that use the euro currency.  The ultimate scale of the exodus is likely to depend on the terms of the divorce and when it occurs.  Britain is due to leave the European Union in just nine days, but Prime Minister Theresa May has failed to win support in the UK parliament for the divorce deal she struck with the rest of the European Union. May is now asking the European Union to delay Brexit until June 30. If that doesn't happen, the chances of the country crashing out of the bloc without a transitional deal on March 29 increase.  The Bank of England has said the fallout from that scenario would be worse than the 2008 financial crisis. For financial institutions, a disorderly Brexit would be a nightmare, and they're taking steps to limit the damage.  \"As the day draws nearer, we need to recognize that there are risks that are out of the sector's control,\" said Omar Ali, head of UK financial services at EY. \"No financial services businesses can know for sure how a disorderly Brexit will impact them, their clients, people and supply chains or, more broadly, the UK economy.\"","67":" (CNN)French World Cup star Kylian Mbappe has donated $34,000 to a crowdfunding campaign launched to finance a private search mission in the hope of finding missing soccer player Emiliano Sala. Mbappe's Paris Saint-Germain teammate Adrien Rabiot and Marseille's Dmitri Payet as well as several other well known players from across Europe have also made sizable donations to the campaign, which was set up by Sport Cover, the management agency that represents Sala. The crowdfunding initiative, which has nearly reached $400,000, was launched in response to the decision by UK authorities to abandon its recovery mission last Thursday. Sala, who had just signed for Cardiff City, was flying from Nantes to the Welsh capital after saying farewell to his former teammates following his $19.3 million move to the Premier League club. Rescue workers had been attempting to locate the plane since it disappeared from radar near the Channel Islands just before 8:30 p.m. local time (3:30 p.m. ET) last Monday. The plane had requested descent on passing Guernsey but disappeared from radar at about 2,300 feet. But police finally called off the search at 15.15pm local time (10.15 a.m ET) Thursday, adding they had been unable to find any trace of the plane, pilot David Ibbotson or Sala Guernsey harbourmaster Captain David Barker said any chances of survival were \"extremely remote.\" Sala's sister Romina, who arrived in Cardiff last week, had begged the authorities to reconsider its decision but to no avail. She has since been joined in the UK by other family members. \"The family still have some hope, they're looking at this as a missing person, a missing plane, and until they are satisfied, that's the mode that we're in,\" David Mearns, a spokesman for the Sala family, told reporters Sunday. \"This is a family that have come from Argentina with this huge shock out of nowhere and (is) struggling with what had happened, with very, very few answers about an unexplained loss.\" Sala had been expected to make his Premier League debut for Cardiff at Arsenal on Tuesday. On Monday, the club's manager, Neil Warnock revealed that the League Managers' Association (LMA) -- an organization representing managers of English football clubs -- had offered him support, and that several Cardiff players had spoken to psychologists in the wake of Sala's disappearance. Warnock said the dressing room had been a \"somber\" place over the last week, adding that he had been struggling to cope with the emotional impact of the player's disappearance. \"You think 24 hours a day about whether to carry on,\" Warnock told reporters. \"It's impossible to sleep. I've been in football management for 40 years and it's been by far the most difficult week in my career, by an absolute mile  \"It's been a traumatic week and even now I can't get my head around the situation. It's probably hit me harder than anyone else as I've met the lad and talked to him for the last six to eight weeks.\" Sala had been expected in Cardiff for his first day of training last Tuesday.. But his failure to arrive in the Welsh capital sparked a rescue mission over the English Channel after the plane, a single turbine Piper Malibu, disappeared from radar after departing from Nantes. Last Wednesday it emerged that Sala sent a WhatsApp audio message to a group of friends while on board the plane. It was unclear exactly when Sala sent the message but he describes being tired and can be heard yawning. Sala appears to joke about the aircraft, telling his friends in a deadpan tone: \"I'm here on the plane and it looks like it's going to fall down in pieces.\" He then says that training with Cardiff would start the next day. Near the end of the recording, he appears to make another joke, saying: \"If in an hour and a half you don't have news from me ... I don't know if they would send someone to look for me because they won't find me, but you will know. Dude, I'm so scared.\" Throughout the message, his voice is monotone and there is no indication that his comments about the state of the plane are anything but dark humor. Sala's family spokesperson confirmed to reporters in Argentina that the message was genuine and expressed dismay that it had been made public. The UK Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) has opened an investigation into the plane's disappearance.  \"We are looking at all operational aspects of the flight including licensing,\" an AAIB spokesman told the UK Press Association. Rescue teams searched 1,700 square miles and scanned through phone data and satellite imagery but were unable to find any trace of the plane.","68":" (CNN)During most of President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, members of Congress limited their responses to standard moves like applause, cheers or silence. A couple of times, lawmakers were more animated. One of those moments came when Missouri Republican Rep. Ann Wagner reacted to Trump's comments on paid family leave, an effort his daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has prioritized since early in his presidency. \"I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave -- so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child,\" Trump said. \"Yes!\" Wagner shouted as Trump touted the proposal. Wagner worked with Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and Ivanka Trump to put forward a bill last August that would allow new parents to finance paid leave by pulling from their Social Security funds. Their proposal received criticism at the time from Democrats who slammed the idea of delaying retirement benefits for those who want to take part, arguing instead for the creation of a national paid leave program funded by a payroll tax. The issue is likely to reemerge in the 116th Congress under Democratic leadership in the House. Wagner confirmed after the speech that she had been the one who reacted loudly during that portion of Trump's speech. She told reporters she has spoken \"extensively\" about the bill with the White House and that she hopes to restart the conversation soon. \"We're looking forward to resurrecting some of those discussions now,\" Wagner said. \"I was so pleased to hear the President give a strong shoutout for it tonight. I was the first on my feet to say, 'Yes!' I'm a big supporter and advocate in this arena.\" \"I am very, very much about bringing this legislation forward. We're working, like I said, on a bipartisan basis to get this done,\" she added.","69":" (CNN)It would be hard to think of a more damaging day for a President than one on which his former campaign chairman disappeared behind bars for years to come. But Paul Manafort's new sentence was the least of Donald Trump's worries Wednesday as his Russia investigation nightmare took yet another turn for the worse. New suspicions about dangled pardons, conflicting congressional testimony, implicit pleas for clemency and fresh suggestions of inappropriate presidential behavior delivered a new twist to the drama with Washington already on edge in anticipation of special counsel Robert Mueller's final report. A new firestorm erupted over disputed assertions that ex-acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker did not deny in a closed congressional meeting that he had spoken with President Donald Trump about a case involving Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen. CNN reported explosive new revelations involving Cohen's allegation that a pardon had been dangled in exchange for him staying loyal to the President, in which he was purportedly told he could be sure he had \"friends in high places.\" Both new angles on the Russia intrigue came on the day that a judge added to the prison sentence of Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, after he was snared in Mueller's investigation. He faces a total of 7.5 years in prison.  For the second time in a week, a Manafort attorney emerged from a sentencing hearing and appeared to twist a judge's words in a way that raised suspicions he was bolstering Trump's claims that there was \"no collusion\" in return for a pardon for his client. Trump did little to stem speculation he might act in such a manner by saying he felt \"very badly\" for Manafort, while making the barely believable assertion that the thought of springing Manafort from jail after his convictions for tax and financial fraud, obstruction and witness tampering had never entered his mind. Those comments came two days after White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared to imply Trump had at least thought about freeing Manafort by saying, \"He'll make a decision when he is ready.\" As is often the case in the Russia investigation and associated cases, vital details remain unknown and there is a sense that the information available to the public is only scratching the surface of what might really have happened. But equally there is no proven direct evidence of collusion by the President from any of the multiple investigations that are swirling around his White House and are now digging deep into his personal and business affairs as well as the 2016 campaign. Still, a day of frenetic activity and foreboding claims and counterclaims raised new questions about the appropriateness of the President's past behavior and whether he will try to absolve his former associates with his pardon power -- one of the most compelling questions in Washington in early 2019. Wednesday's developments underscored once more the peril the President potentially faces from the new investigative powers of the freshly elected Democratic-led House. The politics raging around the investigations also suggested yet again how hard it will be for the nation to eventually coalesce around an outcome that offers a sense of closure after the uproar of the 2016 election. The new developments could also prompt a discussion of whether Mueller has more work to do at a moment when he had appeared to be close to filing the report on his investigation with the attorney general. Whitaker back on the hot seat House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler demonstrated the Democrats' capacity to break open new seams of the Russia controversy when he emerged from a closed-door meeting with Whitaker to talk to reporters. The New York Democrat said that unlike in a previous open congressional hearing, Whitaker did not deny that Trump had called him to discuss the Cohen case, \"He did not deny it,\" Nadler said. \"He did not say no.\" The issue could be significant because it raises the possibility that the President spoke to the then-top Justice Department official about a case linked to his personal and business affairs involving his former fixer. At best, such a conversation would appear inappropriate and unethical since the President is the country's top law enforcement officer. At worst it could again raise suggestions that Trump may have obstructed justice, in addition to possible past examples of such behavior being investigated by Mueller. Nadler also said Whitaker had indicated that he was involved in conversations about the recusal of Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, in the Cohen case. The former acting attorney general also said he was involved in discussions over whether Berman's prosecutors had gone too far in a campaign finance case in which Trump was effectively referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator. It would not be unusual for a President to discuss personnel matters with an attorney general or even specific cases. But if the officials in question were involved in investigations of the commander in chief, it would look highly suspicious. Like most of the developments in the Russia investigation, the new revelations were difficult to fit into a wider picture since the top Republican on the committee provided a contrary version of events in the meeting with Whitaker. \"In fact, he had said he did not talk with the President about Mr. Cohen at all,\" said Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia. \"And then no conversation with the Southern District of New York at all, either.\" 'Friends in high places' There was another case Wednesday of conflicting narratives involving Cohen -- who is headed to jail in May for offenses including lying to Congress. Two emails provided to Congress by the President's former attorney reopened the controversy over his claims that Trump had dangled a pardon -- an accusation that the President and his allies have vigorously denied. An attorney who said he had been speaking with Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani reassured Cohen in an April 2018 email that Cohen could \"sleep well tonight\" because he had \"friends in high places.\" CNN's Gloria Borger reported. That and another email obtained by CNN and dated the same day do not specifically mention a pardon. The attorney who wrote them, Robert Costello, told CNN that Cohen's interpretation of events is \"utter nonsense.\" Costello said Cohen had asked him to raise the issue of a pardon with Giuliani. A source with knowledge of Cohen's thinking at the time disputes Costello's version of events and says it was Costello who was pushing his relationship with Giuliani. Another source familiar with the emails said Trump's legal team had been trying to keep Cohen in the fold as a way to keep him quiet, hinting that a pardon could be in the mix at some point. Trump twists a judge's words -- again Before she sentenced Manafort in a hearing in Washington on Wednesday, Judge Amy Berman Jackson took pains to try to ensure the substance of the case could not be willfully misinterpreted by anyone outside the courtroom -- perhaps even the President. Trump had seized on out-of-context comments emerging from Manafort's case in Virginia last week to claim that the judge had effectively absolved his 2016 campaign of colluding with Russia's election interference effort. Jackson clearly said the question of collusion was \"not resolved\" in this case, \"one way or another,\" and was part of an ongoing investigation.   That did not stop Trump from misinterpreting her remarks in the service of his ongoing effort to brand the Russia investigation a \"witch hunt\": \"Today, again, no collusion. The other day, no collusion.\" Manafort's lawyer Kevin Downing emerged after sentencing to voice a message that could have been written by Trump himself and was widely seen as a direct appeal to Trump on behalf of his aging client. \"So that makes two courts,\" Downing said. \"Two courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with the Russians.\"   The sense that the Manafort saga is one of the most politicized in recent memory deepened when Manhattan's district attorney -- shortly after Jackson handed down her sentence -- unveiled new state charges against Manafort including mortgage fraud, falsifying business records and conspiracy. Though the indictment was exhaustive, the move has political implications since it could be interpreted as a warning to Trump that if he pardons Manafort for his federal convictions, the ex-lobbyist could still face years in jail on state charges that are beyond the President's reach. Several leading Democrats also left the impression that the judicial process -- which resulted in two credible cases against Manafort in separate jurisdictions  -- risked being tainted by political considerations. Commenting on Manafort's sentence of 47 months in Virginia, which was below federal guidelines, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff argued that \"those who are well represented get one kind of sentence, and those who are not get a different kind of sentence.\" The California Democrat spoke before Jackson delivered her verdict. After Manafort's second sentence, which could see the almost 70-year-old spend most of the rest of his life behind bars, Sen. Cory Booker, who's running for president, was asked by CNN's Manu Raju whether it was sufficient. \"No,\" the New Jersey Democrat said.","70":" (CNN)Beto O'Rourke says he supports universal health care, but he wants to take a different path to get there than many of his more progressive rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The former Texas representative is backing a little-known House Democratic proposal called Medicare for America, which calls for expanding government-run health coverage while keeping employer-sponsored insurance plans.  For O'Rourke, the proposal's appeal is that he thinks it moves the country to guaranteed health care more quickly than the alternatives, including the signature Medicare for All proposal from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who is also vying for the Democratic nomination. That's in part because it would maintain the private insurance industry, which is a deal breaker among progressives. \"What it says is, if you like your employer-sponsored insurance, you like the network that you're in, you like the doctors that you can see, you're happy with that, you can keep it,\" O'Rourke said Thursday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. in response to an audience question. \"If you do not like your employer-based insurance and want to enroll in Medicare, you can. If you have no insurance whatsoever or if you are under-insured today, you can enroll in Medicare as well.\"  While many Americans like the idea of expanding Medicare, their support drops when they hear private insurance would be eliminated, according to polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Medicare for America would address those concerns, said Jen Tolbert, the foundation's director of state health reform. \"The bill does try to strike a middle ground,\" she said. The Medicare for America legislation was introduced last year by Reps. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, and Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from Illinois. But unlike most of the other Medicare for All-type plans, it doesn't have a Senate version that's supported by other candidates. The gradual shift to a government-run program is very similar to a proposal from the Center for American Progress, a moderate left-leaning think tank. It provides the most politically viable path to universal coverage, while respecting those who like their employer coverage, said Topher Spiro, the center's vice president for health policy. \"For those who are not satisfied with their employer coverage, it allows them the option to move over to the Medicare plan at their own pace,\" Spiro said. \"Our view is that people will vote with their feet.\" Retaining private insurance plans, however, is unlikely to win the plan many fans in the health care industry. It's still a stepping stone to a single payer system, which eliminates consumer choice and does little to address costs, said Lauren Crawford Shaver, executive director of the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a coalition of insurance, pharmaceutical, hospital and doctor groups, which opposes all Medicare for All-type plans. Here's how Medicare for America would work: Medicare for America provides comprehensive benefits -- including prescription drugs, dental, vision and long-term care -- to those currently on Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare plans, as well as to the uninsured. Newborns would automatically be enrolled.  Private insurance, however, would continue to be an option. Large employers could keep providing benefits, though they can also help their workers buy Medicare for America coverage. Employees can also choose Medicare for America coverage over their work-based plan. And folks could opt to buy private policies through a Medicare Advantage-type plan or decide to keep their children on their work-based polices. The legislation, however, isn't as generous as the Medicare for All proposals, which essentially provides all care at no cost. Enrollees would have to pay up to 9.7% of their monthly income as premiums, though the poor would pay nothing and subsidies would be available for the middle class. There would also be deductibles and co-pays, with an annual limit of $3,500, or $5,000 for families. To finance the program, the plans calls for undoing the Republican tax bill, imposing a 5% surtax on adjusted gross income above $500,000, and increasing the Medicare payroll tax. Also, there would be levies on investment income above a certain threshold, tobacco products, beer, wine, liquor, and sugar-sweetened drinks. States would also have to contribute an amount equal to what they currently spend on Medicaid.","71":"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump looks -- and is acting -- rattled and encircled by the Russia investigation. And a series of fresh disclosures on Tuesday show there is every reason for him to feel threatened by the vast shadow it is casting over his life, business and presidency. Newly unsealed court documents detailing special counsel Robert Mueller's activity reveal an investigative field of breathtaking scope and a prosecutorial machine that ratcheted quickly up in mid-2017. The search warrants targeting Trump's ex-personal lawyer Michael Cohen offer a glimpse of the covert world of the probe. As is often the case with Mueller, they give only a tantalizing hint of the wider, yet still hidden, puzzle. But such disclosures are almost never good news for Trump. There is enough to explain from Tuesday's reveal why the investigation must be weighing on Trump's spirits, and driving his angry Twitter outbursts. The vast breadth of the investigation by various jurisdictions also could offer a rich seam for Democratic House chairmen should they eventually subpoena primary evidence uncovered by Mueller and other prosecutors. And the release underlines that various investigations that are penetrating deep into Trump's business, personal and political life are likely to be haunting the President for years to come -- even after Mueller has left the stage. Campaign finance case still alive The pages of warrants make clear that the investigation into whether the Trump Organization is implicated in the campaign finance case involving his hush money payments to women before the 2016 election is still open. Eighteen-and-a-half blacked-out pages at the end of one document under the title \"The Illegal Campaign Contribution Scheme\" almost certainly contain details of Trump's interactions with Cohen. That prosecutors from the Southern District of New York believe those elements need to be kept out of the public eye suggests that their investigations -- which have already indirectly implicated Trump -- are not over. \"They are not done. We have seen this in filings over and over again,\" Preet Bharara, a former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, told CNN's Jake Tapper. So Trump cannot yet be sure whether his family members or top business associates in his firm could face criminal jeopardy. For the President, who seeks to exert dominance over every room, situation or relationship, the lack of control over the fate of his own clan and the business that bears his name as prosecutors bear down must be close to intolerable. Some legal observers see the work of the Southern District as Trump's most perilous legal front, even more so than Mueller's look at whether there was coordination between Trump campaign aides and Russia and whether the President obstructed justice to cover it up. While a sitting President cannot be indicted, according to current Justice Department guidance, Trump cannot be certain that he will not be prosecuted for campaign finance violations when he eventually leaves office. \"If I was Donald Trump, I would be scared,\" Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, said on CNN's \"The Situation Room.\" The fact that prosecutors have already endorsed Cohen's statement that he made the payments in violation of campaign finance laws at the direction of Trump means \"there may be another shoe to drop,\" said Bharara. \"There may be other people who are assisting or who are conspiring, up to and including the President, and they haven't decided how they want to proceed on that,\" he added. More Russia links Tuesday's documents also contain more evidence that Trump associates, in this case Cohen, appeared to have at least indirect connections to powerful Russians. They show that Cohen was paid more than $500,000 through his company as a business consultant from January to August 2017 by Columbus Nova LLC., an investment management firm that is linked to Russian national Viktor Vekselberg. Vekselberg is an oligarch -- with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin -- who is under US sanctions regarding election interference. Columbus Nova said in a statement that neither Vekselberg nor anyone outside the firm had been involved in the decision to hire Cohen or to provide funding for his work. Cohen, who will go to jail in May after he admitted lying to Congress and for tax and fraud offenses, was not charged with unlawfully acting as an unregistered foreign lobbyist. But he is far from the only Trump associate to have suggestions of links that can be traced back to prominent Russians. Many of those Trump allies have been caught by Mueller trying to hide such relationships. The question of whether foreign influence and quid pro quos were in play during the Trump campaign for the presidency, and early in his administration, gets to the heart of what Mueller is charged with investigating. Feeding the 'witch hunt' narrative  Methods used by investigators to track Cohen, including state-of-the-art techniques targeting Apple devices, and the revelation of their sweep through the lawyer's emails and telephone communications may fuel Trump's fury about what he sees as the special counsel's \"witch hunt.\" They also suggest that Mueller and his counterparts in New York may know a lot about the communications of people around Trump during parts of the 2016 campaign and early in the presidency. The documents show that Mueller had shown probable cause that Cohen had committed a crime to obtain warrants for two email accounts as far back as the summer of 2017, nine months before FBI agents acting on behalf of New York prosecutors raided Cohen's office and residences. Trump's siege mentality is unlikely to be helped by the simultaneous publication Tuesday of a double page spread in his hometown newspaper, The New York Times, revealing his complicated financial relationship with Deutsche Bank. Although the article did not show any illegality, it is the kind of unflattering deep dive critique of his personal and business practices that Trump abhors. Given the avalanche of revelations, it's not surprising that the President is sometimes prone to isolated outbursts of fury directed at Mueller. \"THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO A PRESIDENT AGAIN!\" Trump tweeted out of the blue on Saturday. Tuesday's revelations also provided the context against which the President stood in the White House Rose Garden and claimed the real \"collusion\" in US politics was between social media companies opposed to conservatives. Trump praised Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro -- a leader with autocratic tendencies in his own image -- of buying into his \"fake news\" narrative. \"It seems to be if they're conservative, if they're Republicans, if they're in a certain group, there's discrimination, and big discrimination,\" Trump added. Claims that the President is being muffled on social media hardly seem credible given that he has 59 million Twitter followers and can set the political agenda by banging out a few characters. It's also notable that Mueller has indicted three Russian entities and 13 Russian nationals in connection with Moscow's operation to use social media to interfere in the 2016 election, sow political discord and elect Trump. New intrigue over Rosenstein Washington has been on edge for several weeks over expectations that Mueller is getting toward the end of the road. But there was a new wrinkle on Tuesday with the news that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has overseen much of the Mueller probe, is not yet ready to leave his job. Rosenstein had been expected to leave in mid-March, now that a new attorney general, William Barr, who is not recused from the Russia probe like his predecessor Jeff Sessions, has taken office. Rosenstein will now stay \"a little longer\" than originally anticipated. A source familiar with the matter told CNN's Pamela Brown that Rosenstein is waiting for Mueller to deliver his report to Barr. Rosenstein sees himself as the \"heat shield\" since he appointed Mueller, and could be in position to take the \"hit\" if controversy explodes when the report drops, the source said. Slow-rolling Trump's defense While Trump may feel increasingly isolated, there are new indications that Democrats who have launched their own vast investigation against Trump world will encounter significant difficulties. The White House has missed a House Judiciary Committee deadline to turn over scores of records related to an investigation over whether Trump abused power. Some former officials who received letters from the committee requesting documents, including former White House counsel Don McGahn and former deputy counsel Annie Donaldson, are referring them to the White House. Republican aides said the committee had gotten responses from only eight of the 81 officials who had received letters from the committee earlier this month, and a ninth had mailed documents, though they had yet to be received. Democrats painted a more positive picture, but the speed bumps were a sign of the tortuous road of subpoenas and legal challenges ahead as House Democrats face White House resistance. People outside the government, however, are more exposed to subpoenas than others in the administration, as they cannot wage long fights citing executive privilege concerns as an excuse not to hand over documents.","72":"Washington (CNN)House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings says that his panel has obtained information that calls into question previous statements made by attorneys representing President Donald Trump to federal officials about 2016 hush-money payments to keep an alleged Trump extramarital affair under wraps. In a letter February 15 to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, Cummings says his committee has obtained new documents showing that Trump's personal attorney Sheri Dillon and Stefan Passantino, a former White House official who now represents the Trump Organization, \"may have provided false information\" when they were questioned by federal ethics officials about hush money payments paid to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. CNN has reached out to Passantino, Cipollone and Dillon for comment. Passantino declined to comment and CNN has not yet heard back from Dillon and Cipollone.  In a separate letter to Trump Organization attorney Alan Futerfas, Cummings warns that his panel may subpoena the Trump Organization for documents related to the payments made by Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to prevent her from speaking publicly about her alleged affair with Trump, if the company doesn't comply by next week. \"I write to correct your fundamental misunderstanding of the role of Congressional oversight and to insist on full compliance with the Committee's January 8, 2019, document request,\" writes Cummings, a Maryland Democrat. \"We just received the letter and we'll review it carefully,\" Futerfas told CNN.  In the letter to Cipollone, Cummings refers to notes his committee obtained citing a federal Office of Government Ethics official who referred to the \"changing explanations and excuse from the President's legal team as 'evolving stories.'\" According to the letter, Dillon \"repeatedly\" told OGE officials in spring 2018 that Trump \"never owed any money\" to Cohen. But after Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani revealed in a May 2018 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity that Trump reimbursed Cohen for the payments, and Trump confirmed he did on Twitter, Dillon changed her story, according to the Cummings letter. After being asked about the Giulani comments and Trump tweet, Dillon told OGE officials that Cohen \"always knew\" he would be \"reimbursed\" but the \"mechanisms for reimbursement changed over time.\" Cohen pleaded guilty to two campaign finance related charges for facilitating the payment to Daniels and a $150,000 \"catch and kill\" payment American Media Inc. made to former playboy model Karen McDougal to silence her allegation of an affair with Trump. Cohen said under oath that he made the payments \"in coordination with and at the direction of\" Trump.   The letter says that Passantino made similar comments, telling OGE officials that Cohen \"was authorized to outlay and that was part of the retainer agreement.\" But Dillon would not allow OGE staff to see the retainer agreement because, she said, \"it was privileged.\" But federal prosecutors from the US Attorneys Office in the Southern District of New York said there was \"no retainer agreement\" between Cohen and Trump dealing with these payments to silence women's stories ahead of the 2016 election.  Cummings, in his letter to Cipollone, also cites also the President's financial disclosure form, which in May 2018 belatedly disclosed payments up to $250,000 to Cohen. But federal prosecutors said that Trump's payments to Cohen came in 12 monthly installments of $35,000, beginning in 2017, amounting to a total of $420,000, according to the Cummings letter. The top Republican on the committee -- Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio -- said the letter \"is merely retreading an old and tired story intended to embarrass the President\" and that \"There is nothing new here.\" \"The Democrats' attempt to use cherry-picked confidential deliberations with the Office of Government Ethics to smear the President will have a chilling effect on Executive Branch employees wishing to obtain ethics advice,\" Jordan said in a statement.  In a follow-up letter, Jordan and Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina accused Cummings of making \"extremely unfair and unsupported accusations.\" \"By making public assertions that these two lawyers made false statements \u2014 without even allowing them to respond \u2014 you have besmirched their reputations and have caused them irreparable professional harm,\" the GOP lawmakers wrote. This story has been updated to include details from a letter House Republicans sent in response to Cummings. ","73":" (CNN)President Donald Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen spent several hours Thursday inside the Senate Intelligence Committee's secure spaces ahead of his closed-door testimony scheduled before the panel next week. Cohen was on Capitol Hill on Thursday in the Senate Intelligence Committee's secure spaces ahead of next week's interview. He spent most of the day there, with a break for lunch at the Monocle, a restaurant near the Capitol. He left shortly before 5 p.m. ET and declined to answer any questions on his way out. Cohen is scheduled to be interviewed by the Senate Intelligence Committee behind closed doors on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the matter, the first of three congressional appearances next week for the President's former lawyer. Cohen is slated to testify publicly on Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee and behind closed doors again Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee. It's not clear why Cohen was in the Senate Intelligence Committee's office ahead of his testimony, an unusual step for witnesses who have been interviewed by the panel as part of its two-year Russia investigation. Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, told reporters Thursday afternoon that Cohen was conferring with his attorneys and did not have any meetings with the committee. He would not say if Cohen was reviewing the committee's documents or his previous interview transcript. A spokeswoman for Senate Intelligence chairman Richard Burr did not respond to requests for comment on Cohen's testimony next week or his appearance Thursday. A spokeswoman for the panel's top Democrat Sen. Mark Warner declined comment. Cohen is scheduled to begin a three-year prison sentence on May 6, a date that was pushed back by two months in part because his lawyer requested more time for Cohen to prepare for his congressional testimony. Cohen was sentenced in December for tax crimes, campaign finance violations tied to hush money payments to women and lying to Congress during his 2017 testimony about how long negotiations for a Trump Tower Moscow extended into the 2016 campaign. The Intelligence Committee's staff has done the vast majority of the questioning for the committee's Russia investigation, which has included more than 200 interviews. Burr has publicly lauded the staff from both parties for their conduct in the interviews, saying that witnesses often commented they didn't know who was a Republican and who was a Democrat. But Cohen is coming to the committee for a second time -- when he first appeared in 2017 he told the lies that he pleaded guilty to in December 2018 -- and this time he is appearing under subpoena. Before Cohen's first interview, Burr threatened to hold a public hearing for Cohen after he released a statement to the media. But Burr relented and Cohen was interviewed by staff behind closed doors. The House Oversight and Senate and House Intelligence committees have eagerly sought for Cohen to appear before he reports to prison \u2014 though all three had to postpone his testimony earlier this month, citing different reasons. The Senate Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena for his testimony, while he is appearing voluntarily before the House panels. Cohen's closed-door testimony is expected to touch on the Russia investigation, but not his public testimony. House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings wrote a memo outlining the scope of Cohen's public testimony, including Trump's \"debts and payments relating to efforts to influence the 2016 election\"; Trump's compliance with financial disclosure requirements, campaign finance laws and tax laws; and Trump's business practices. Republicans have signaled they won't abide by those guidelines. Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the panel, said in a statement Thursday that the Cohen hearing was \"phase one of the Democrats' coordinated campaign to remove the President from office.\" \"Our members intend to question Mr. Cohen about the crimes he pleaded guilty to, other criminal activity he participated in but refused to disclose, his international financial dealings, and a long list of other probative activities,\" Jordan said.","74":"If your day doesn't start until you've gotten up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

College admissions scandal It's being called the biggest college admissions scam ever.\u00a0Fifty people -- including rich parents, famous actresses, college prep officials and coaches -- are accused in a federal indictment of participating in a scheme to get students into top-notch colleges. Here's how the scam allegedly worked: Parents paid a college prep organization to take tests on students' behalf or correct their answers. The organization also bribed college coaches to get the students into desired schools as recruited athletes, even if they didn't play sports, prosecutors said.\u00a0 The biggest names caught up in this include actresses\u00a0Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin. Prosecutors say they have Huffman, a one-time Oscar nominee, on tape talking about the scheme.

Ethiopian plane crash The pilot of the Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed over the weekend was wrestling with \"flight control problems\" before the plane went down, the airline's CEO\u00a0told CNN. A number of nations have temporarily banned Boeing 737 Max jets from flying in their countries as authorities continue investigating the air tragedy. And many still wonder if there's any link between this crash and October's Lion Air disaster, when another 737 Max 8 flight went down in the Java Sea, killing 189 people. Right now, 737 Max planes are only flying in the US and Canada. Boeing says the planes are safe. But some in\u00a0Congress aren't so sure, and the Senate plans to hold an air safety hearing. Among the 157 people killed in the Ethiopia crash was an\u00a0entire family from Canada. Kosha Vaidya, of Ontario, was\u00a0taking\u00a0her teen daughters to Kenya to show them where she was born.

View more opinion at CNN.  As the President spent his day overseas trying to reach a historic deal with the North Koreans, Cohen painted a portrait of a leader who has engaged in all sorts of fraud, broke campaign finance laws, associated with devious figures, knew of the dirty and possibly illegal tricks being done by some members of his campaign and who instructed associates like Cohen to intimidate people who were perceived as a threat. As if that was not enough, Cohen alleged that the President is a racist. (All of these allegations have been denied by the White House or by the President's GOP defenders.)  But will the hearings change public opinion?  The Republicans on the Oversight Committee gave a pretty good indication of why President Trump's base is unlikely to move even a little. They essentially are in tune with Trump's statement from 2016: \"I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters.\" Throughout their questioning of Cohen, the Republicans showed absolutely no interest in probing the issues that were raised about the President.  They spent the entire time  attacking Cohen's behavior and making insinuations about the Democratic-led hearings themselves. Republicans took every opportunity to remind the public that Cohen is on his way to prison, in part for lying to Congress. They used Cohen's lawyer and former Clinton associate, Lanny Davis, and suggestions about mysterious forces funding him, as the bogeyman to allege that Cohen's testimony was politically motivated.  The actual substance of the charges, which have not only been raised by Cohen but have come from multiple investigations, were of no interest. Republicans didn't want to listen to his answers and used this opportunity to grandstand for their voters. Their performance reveals how many of Trump's most loyal Republicans will certainly act.  But that does not mean that portions of the Republican Party outside the base can't be moved by congressional hearings. After all, what motivates their ongoing support for President Trump is much more about partisan interests than loyalty. This means he is not invulnerable. It would be possible to turn segments of the party against him if he has taken actions that they feel are too risky.  The first tangible evidence that defections are possible since the passage of the Russians sanctions legislation in 2017, were the 13 Republicans who voted with House Democrats to pass a resolution seeking to revoke his emergency power to build a wall.  It was also clear to President Trump during the final days of the shutdown that his time for that battle was over: either he agreed to pass a budget resolution or the Republicans would move forward without him. With the midterms only a few months behind them and polls showing that Trump is struggling in the battleground states which were key to his victory, such as Wisconsin and Michigan, Republicans are justifiably worried.  These signs of defection are certainly far from any indication that he is at any risk with his own party. But it would be a mistake to discount the potential for full-blown hearings to change the dynamics within the Republican Party and to further damage Trump's standing with independent voters. The testimony of Michael Cohen alone won't do the trick. He is a severely flawed witness given his record, and his words alone cannot paint a damning picture of the administration to Republicans who remain focused on victory in 2020.  Committee Republicans demonstrated that they have no interest in listening. The conservative media, which didn't exist when Richard Nixon was president, will be spinning the day's events a million different ways, in Trump's favor.  However, robust hearings can matter. Seeing and hearing the major players in a scandal is much different than reading about them or seeing a prosecutorial report.  The gold standard remains the Watergate committee that did have the effect, over a period of many weeks and with numerous witnesses, to break down the Republican support that President Nixon continued to count on until the very end. The congressional hearings and investigations were successful in that they helped legislators in both parties gain a fuller picture of what the Nixon White House was about and to put the original sin, the break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters, into a larger context.  Some of the outcome in 2019 will depend on the Democrats and how far they are willing to go to ensure accountability and pursue a full-blown investigation, even at the risk of political backlash.

View more opinion at CNN. With numbers like these, Sanders has -- for the second time in four years -- taken Democrats by surprise. The Brooklyn native has been repeatedly dismissed as a far-out senior and socialist who represents the \"Ben and Jerry\" electorate of Vermont. \"There's enough ageism, religious bigotry and reflexive horror at the idea of socialism among the broad electorate,\" wrote columnist Eric Zorn in the Chicago Tribune in 2016, \"that, if he wins the nomination, Sanders would probably lose every state\u2014even his home state of Vermont.\"  Despite the skeptics, Sanders has demonstrated yet again that he has the ability to draw the kind of passionate and loyal support that Democrats will need going into 2020.  Other Democrats who are in the campaign mix are moving quickly to quash his candidacy. Harris, one of the most promising challengers to emerge so far, rejected the label commonly associated with Sanders and told voters in New Hampshire earlier this week, \"I am not a democratic socialist.\" Beto O'Rourke, who is still considering a campaign, told reporters that the country can't meet \"fundamental challenges\" without \"harnessing the power of the market.\" These and other remarks have all been interpreted as a slam against Sanders. Although many Democratic candidates appear focused on beating Sanders, they should take a pause from the horse race to look at both his years in the Senate and the elements of his 2016 campaign that seem to give him such strong appeal. Given that President Donald Trump attracts resolute devotion from many of his supporters, Democrats should learn from some aspects of Sanders' example and use them to galvanize a strong base. Here are key elements from Sanders' approach to politics that could benefit the other candidates. Build a movement, not a campaign Sanders understood from the start of his 2016 presidential campaign that his mission was to build a movement, not just run for office. He always framed his candidacy in terms of bringing together voters who were frustrated with the status quo and wanted to fight for a different vision of American society. In doing so, he tapped into the spirit of the 1960s activism that rocked American politics. Despite having what some critics say is a larger-than-life ego, Sanders offered a candidacy that made his followers feel as if they were fighting for something bigger than themselves.  The movement was essential to sustaining his campaign against Hillary Clinton through an improbable primary and caucus run. And it didn't stop after Sanders lost. He has continued to work with candidates running for Congress and has used his public platform to keep selling his message. Many of his key ideas have since been embraced throughout the Democratic Party, and the payoff was evident from a new crop of legislators elected in the 2018 midterms. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for one, does not shy away from progressive visions.  Don't be afraid to present bold ideas Say what you will about his socialism or his sometimes-abrasive personality, but Sanders is a politician who believes in putting forward big ideas. The senator is not cut from the Bill Clinton model of politics, where the goal is to aim toward the pragmatic center and position one's ideas in such a way that they are difficult to attack as leftist.  In contrast to a political orthodoxy in Washington which almost always pushes candidates in that centrist direction, Sanders simply refuses to twist himself into knots. He likes to give the electorate big policies to chew on. In 2016, he focused on Medicare-for-all, a higher minimum wage, free college tuition, campaign finance reform, and ending growing economic inequality. Although it was easy to mock the repetitious and unpolished style of his campaign rhetoric, it gave voters a menu of ideas that very much defined what his movement was about. Many voters were glad to hear from a candidate who aimed for the moon and believed that the goal of a political campaign was to offer inspiration and aspiration rather than a set of finely tuned positions that had been watered down after several rounds of focus-group tests.  Authenticity matters Sanders, who ostensibly understood that he didn't look the role of a president with his disheveled professorial appearance, decided that he wasn't going to change much. He would give voters Bernie Sanders and hope that they liked what they saw. He didn't embellish his speeches with bombast and he walked onto the stage and into the television studio dressed as he would on any other day in his office. There was a logic to what he did and it explains some of the constituents' passion for Bernie. Voters are sophisticated enough to see through staged events and scripted talking points, and they like to see a real person asking for their vote. On the campaign stage, Sanders acted exactly as he has done throughout his career. He is the grumpy and certain leftie who has a real point of view about how the world works and is insistent on telling everyone what he thinks. He knows what he likes and knows what he hates and refuses to stay quiet about those opinions. From his entrance into presidential politics, he has insisted on being exactly who he is and letting the voters decide what they think rather than molding himself to appeal to their whims.  Fight, fight, fight Sanders doesn't back away from a tough fight. It took a certain amount of chutzpah for him to even run for president in 2016. It was crazy to think that he could take on Clinton or that he could actually put together a legitimate campaign. But he did.  And Sanders did not hesitate to play tough. He is a progressive who knows how to throw a political punch. Sanders mounted an incredibly aggressive campaign in 2016, ignoring the party leaders who asked him to stop his primary campaign to directly confront Clinton on some of her biggest vulnerabilities, from high-paying speeches to corporate donations to her campaign. Since losing the Democratic nomination, Sanders has continued to fight back against President Trump. After Sanders threw his hat in the 2020 ring, Trump tweeted, \"Crazy Bernie has just entered the race. I wish him well!\" Sanders fired back and wrote, \"What's crazy is that we have a president who is racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and a fraud.\" That is the kind of blunt talk Democrats will need to employ in the ugly general election campaign that is sure to come.  It's also important to note that Sanders has on both occasions refused to run for President as a third-party candidate. In doing so, Sanders has demonstrated that he knows what he is fighting for and can see the clear differences between Republican and Democratic policies. Though he certainly made things more difficult for Clinton in 2016, he conducted his fight in the legitimate arena of the primaries rather than risking a Republican victory in the general election by peeling away left-leaning Democratic votes.  While Sanders is certainly a formidable candidate, there are plenty of reasons why many Democrats don't like him. He is not registered as a Democrat. He leans too far to the left for some in the party. He is often vague on the details. His ego seems way too large. He lost in the 2016 primaries so there is no reason to believe he can do better this time.  Female staffers have spoken out about allegations of sexual harassment, disparities in pay, and an uncomfortable professional environment while working for his 2016 campaign. His candidacy also seems like a throwback to the past at a time when a record number of women are running for the presidential nomination; his entrance in the race this time around will also likely steal away support from Sen. Elizabeth Warren in particular, who could be a much stronger general election candidate against Trump.  All of these criticisms are valid and present issues to be vetted.  But Democrats need to stop living in the past and start using a different playbook to take on the future. Sanders' approach, disconnected from the candidate himself, offers 2020 Democratic hopefuls some useful lessons about how they can put together a campaign that energizes, inspires and mobilizes voters to give their party the best chance of winning the White House.","77":"Madeleine Albright is a former US secretary of state. David Miliband is president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee and a former UK foreign secretary. The opinions in this article are those of the authors.  The IRC put Gr\u00f3f on a boat to the United States. When he arrived at Ellis Island, he took the name Andy Grove. Andy Grove went on to become co-founder and CEO of Intel. He is recognized today as one of the people who profoundly shaped Silicon Valley and the digital transformation of the world economy. The decision to admit this one refugee created immense prosperity for America. Not every person fleeing violence is the next Andy Grove, but his story represents a basic truth: when given the opportunity to rebuild their lives in a welcoming country, refugees make enormous contributions. Despite being among the most vulnerable and destitute when they arrive, the data shows that refugees work hard and quickly become net economic contributors in their host societies. In other words, resettling refugees is not just the right thing to do -- it's the smart thing, too. Yet today, the global refugee resettlement system is breaking down. There are approximately 1.4 million refugees worldwide who are in need of urgent resettlement -- either because of their ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or poor health. But in 2018, just 100,000 refugees were resettled, down from the previous year's 180,000. Countries that once proudly welcomed refugees are closing their doors. Under the Trump administration, the United States is less welcoming to the international homeless now than at any time in modern memory. This moment demands bold action -- not only to revive the bipartisan American tradition of resettling refugees, but to broaden the coalition of countries accepting the world's most vulnerable people. At the IRC, we have concluded that persuading more countries to accept refugees requires a new coalition of actors -- from the private sector, philanthropy and civil society -- to address three constraints that hold countries back from doing more. First, we need to address the concern that refugees represent a cost, rather than an asset. In the United States, refugees become net economic contributors -- contributing more to the economy than they have taken out -- after eight years. The European Commission estimates that for every euro spent on refugees, two euros is generated within five years.  We can make the economic argument even more compelling. Right now, when a refugee is resettled, agency representatives decide which town or city to send them to, based on a wide range of criteria. Our partners at Stanford University have developed an algorithm to improve placement decisions by harnessing employment data -- the skills and characteristics of refugees, available jobs in a community, housing costs and other local factors. If we applied the algorithm to the 25 cities where we work today in the US, the employment rate of refugees after three months could be 40% higher. In Switzerland, the algorithm yields a 70% improvement. Second, while refugees go on to become economic contributors, they require up-front investment of between $10,000 and $20,000 to cover the costs of plane tickets, the first few months of housing, and language training. In some countries, enough political will exists to resettle refugees, but not enough to win spending battles at a time of tight public finances. An answer to this problem is to borrow from the models developed in global health, climate finance, and social impact bonds, which have harnessed private finance for public good. At the IRC, we are exploring the possibility of creating a financial facility that pays for the initial cost of resettling refugees. This investment would then be paid back using the refugees' tax contributions as they work.  Finally, we have to deal with the more intangible concern that refugees often face a backlash from local communities. When a refugee is resettled in Canada, a few members of the public -- from a church or local organization -- come together to act as their legal sponsors. This group finds housing, gets children into school, connects them with local jobs, and, like volunteers in the US, provides guidance on everything from transportation to financial literacy. Two million Canadians, or 7% of the adult population, have now sponsored a refugee. By using a digital platform, we believe we can spread the sponsorship model, so that it is much easier to recruit sponsors, match them to refugees, and provide sponsors with the information and support needed to help refugees. Taken together, these three solutions can change the way governments make decisions. There is no easy fix to the current global refugee crisis. But if people see that refugees will be an economic asset, at no up-front cost, with an army of citizens prepared to integrate them and support the cause, we believe the political dynamic around refugee resettlement will begin to shift -- offering hope to millions of refugees around the world who carry the same dreams that Andy Grove once did.","78":" (CNN)Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is facing intensifying pressure by congressional Democrats to provide more details over the Trump administration's decision to remove sanctions on three Russian firms tied to billionaire oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Lawmakers from both chambers sent four separate letters to Mnuchin on Tuesday requesting further details on the Treasury Department's decision to rescind sanctions on Rusal, the world's second-largest aluminum producer, as well as EN+ Group and JSC EuroSibEnergo. The letters asked for details on possible conflicts of interest. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, and Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, wrote to Mnuchin citing press reports asking how he managed his own potential personal and professional conflicts of interest with a major Rusal shareholder, Len Blavatnik. A second letter from California Democrat Rep. Jackie Speier also called into question how their relationship may have influenced the deal.  In a tweet responding to the Speier letter, Tony Sayegh, assistant secretary for public affairs at the US Treasury, said her \"concerns are premised on false information. As our response to her letter will make clear, @stevenmnuchin1 had no direct business relationship with Mr. Blavatnik and any suggestion of a conflict of interest is baseless.\"  A Treasury spokesperson said they have received the letters and are reviewing them. Earlier in the afternoon, the Democratic chairs of the House Financial Services, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees also sent a joint letter to Mnuchin, asking for a detailed accounting of the decision, noting \"the terms of removal are unusual and many questions remain unanswered.\" \"For these reasons, the committees are interested in the process that led to the December 19th announcement to delist,\" the letter stated signed by Reps. Maxine Waters, Rep. Adam Schiff and Rep. Eliot Engel.  Democrats have criticized the deal, arguing in their letter that Deripaska still retains \"significant influence, if not de facto control, over En+, Rusal and ESE\" through his associates and family members. The letters to Mnuchin comes less then two weeks after a hostile meeting with House Democrats on Capitol Hill, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi describing a classified briefing on the plan to relax Russian sanctions as a \"waste of time.\"  Treasury initially notified Congress in December of its intent to lift the sanctions on the firms after months of negotiations to significantly reduce Deripaska's stake in the companies and after the firms agreed to make \"significant restructuring and corporate governance changes.\"  Senate Democrats tried earlier this month to reverse the Trump administration's decision to lift sanctions on the firms utilizing a provision a 2017 Russia sanctions law, but failed to win the 60 votes needed.  Sanctions on the three Russian firms were officially relaxed over the weekend, according to an official government notice. One letter to Mnuchin, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, also requested regular briefings from the Trump administration on any reviews performed so that Congress can continue its oversight of the sanctions imposed on Deripaska and his companies.  \"These recent reports strengthen my determination that the agreement Treasury has struck with Deripaska needs to be overseen strictly not only by OFAC but also by Congress,\" wrote Warner, referring to holdings by family members and close associates of Deripaska -- including his personal foundation, his ex-wife, her father and a firm with links to her family, which combined would amount to a nearly 57% stake of equity in En+.  \"The combination of a nearly 57% equity stake and the ability to vote 35% of EN+ shares suggests that Deripaska and his close associates will continue to have the largest stake -- by far -- in EN+,\" wrote Warner.

Dozens of lawmakers endorsed by the gun-safety group Everytown for Gun Safety now hold seats in the US House -- many part of a freshman wave that helped Democrats seize control of the chamber in November's midterm elections. More than 20 states have passed some form of gun regulation in the last year, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. And a growing number of companies are risking customer backlash to link their brands to the gun-safety movement. Gun-control advocates say nationwide student protests after Parkland -- and the grim succession of mass shootings that have followed in the year since -- all have spurred the further shift in gun politics. And they say a strategy adopted years ago -- to follow a trail blazed by same-sex marriage advocates and take their fights to the states and corporate America -- is paying off. In the coming year, the gun debate could be thrust into the center of the looming 2020 presidential campaign like never before.   Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the largest financial benefactors of the gun-safety movement, is considering entering the Democratic presidential primary. One early 2020 contender -- New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who once earned an A-rating from the National Rifle Association as a moderate Democrat representing an upstate House district -- already has spent part of her campaign rollout explaining her evolution on the gun issue to an increasingly progressive Democratic electorate.  \"We're heading toward a new era on guns,\" said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at the centrist think tank Third Way and a former aide to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. \"I think the tables have turned on the NRA. The gun-safety organizations are just better and smarter than they used to be. They have a lot more resources than they have in the past.\" In House races last year, groups and candidates promoting gun control spent an estimated $23.6 million on television campaign ads -- more than three times the amount spent on ads opposing gun control, according to a Kantar-CMAG analysis prepared for CNN. That's a stark reversal from the 2014 midterms when anti-gun control ads outnumbered gun-control spots by nearly 5-to-1. Last year, the National Rifle Association's spending in federal races dropped sharply, following a record $54 million in 2016 contests, including $30 million to elect pro-gun President Donald Trump, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics. \"Gun safety is no longer the third rail of American politics,\" said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown, a Bloomberg-aligned group that plowed $30 million into the 2018 midterm elections for Congress. \"We've buried that myth.\" In one of the latest examples of the growing corporate activism on guns, Blake Mycoskie, the founder of the California-based Toms shoe company, heads to Capitol Hill this week to deliver more than 700,000 postcards. They urge lawmakers to pass one of the first bills introduced by the new Democratic majority in the House: a measure that would impose background checks on virtually all gun sales. State battles Bloomberg, who Forbes estimates is worth nearly $50 billion, launched Everytown partly in response to a 2012 mass shooting at a Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, where 20 young children and six adults died. Despite weeks of intense debate on Capitol Hill, congressional efforts on guns stalled. Feinblatt said Everytown took a cue from the architects of the marriage-equality movement, which chipped away at state restrictions on same-sex marriage until scoring a historic victory in 2015 when the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide. \"The gun-safety movement did the same thing and is racking up win after win across the country in red, blue and purple states,\" he said.  Gun-control activists have helped pass background-check ballot initiatives in Washington and Nevada, along with a slew of new laws to disarm domestic abusers and allow family members and law enforcement officials to petition courts to temporarily remove firearms from people deemed a threat to themselves or others. In Florida, then-Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, signed bills last year, in the wake of Parkland, raising the minimum age to purchase a gun to 21 from 18 and imposing a three-day waiting period on buying firearms. In neighboring Georgia, Democrat Lucy McBath, a gun-control activist who lost her son to gun violence in 2012, captured a Republican House seat once held by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich following $4 million in spending on her behalf by Everytown. The group also saw 2018 wins in Nevada and Michigan, where Everytown spent $760,000 backing the campaign of Michigan's new Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. It said it spent $2.8 million supporting Steve Sisolak in Nevada, the first Democrat elected governor there since 1994. Sisolak defeated Republican Adam Laxalt, who as Nevada attorney general had opposed a 2016 Bloomberg-backed ballot initiative expanding background checks in the state.  Both states are crucial to Democrats' presidential ambitions: Michigan narrowly backed Trump in 2016 after going for President Barack Obama four years earlier. And Nevada, a perennial presidential swing state, hosts the West's first Democratic nominating contest in 2020.  Everytown's activism means \"no candidate for president can go into those states and not talk pretty muscularly about the issue of gun safety,\" Feinblatt said. Several already have delivered impassioned calls to action against gun-rights forces.   At a CNN town hall last month, California Sen. Kamala Harris, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, lamented the failure of Congress to act on expanded background checks after Sandy Hook. She said lawmakers should have been forced to examine the autopsy photos of the \"babies\" killed at the school. At her presidential campaign announcement Sunday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, declared she was \"not afraid to join the vast majority of Americans ... to stand up to the gun lobby\" and advocate for universal background checks. Bloomberg recently told the Associated Press that he will decide on a presidential bid by month's end. Through his activism on gun-safety issues, Bloomberg has built a substantial political operation.  Everytown officials say it and its affiliates have 5.7 million supporters. In the last six months alone, the former mayor has attended 17 events in 15 states with volunteers from Moms Demand Action, Everytown's grassroots arm, his aides say. \"No one has done more to lead on gun safety than Mike,\" his advisor Howard Wolfson said in a statement. \"Guns would undoubtedly be central to a Bloomberg campaign.\" Under scrutiny The NRA faces its own tests in the months ahead. The organization is under increased scrutiny from Capitol Hill after alleged Russian spy Maria Butina pleaded guilty last December to attempting to infiltrate the association and other conservative groups before and after the 2016 election. Last week, two Democratic lawmakers, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse wrote to the NRA, demanding it provide more information about its activity to help Trump. Advocacy organizations, including a gun-control legal group founded by former Arizona congresswoman and shooting victim Gabby Giffords, have filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission, alleging the NRA illegally coordinated its political advertising with Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and other Republican candidates. Those complaints followed media reports that raised questions about the NRA's relationship with what appeared to be shell companies purchasing ads. Campaign-finance laws bar outside groups from coordinating their spending activities with federal candidates. \"The NRA complies with all election laws and any suggestion to the contrary is false,\" NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said in an email to CNN. And the NRA has argued in an ongoing lawsuit against New York state officials that it could be forced to curtail its operations if New York regulators persist with a crackdown that threatens its insurance and banking relationships.  To be sure, gun-rights groups have had gains in the last year, particularly in red states. NRA officials say 84% of the candidates it endorsed at the state level in 2018 won their elections. A recent law in Wyoming allows individuals to carry concealed weapons into places of worship. And last month, South Dakota's newly elected Republican Gov. Kristi Noem signed her first bill into law: an NRA-backed measure that allows residents and visitors to carry a concealed handgun without first acquiring a permit.  At the federal level, an ardent gun-rights advocate, Republican Marsha Blackburn, won an open US Senate seat in Tennessee last November. Two other Republicans favored by the NRA, Josh Hawley in Missouri and Mike Braun in Indiana toppled Democratic incumbents, helping expand the GOP's majority in the Senate. Those Senate victories have strengthened the NRA's firewall against any efforts in Congress to restrict access to guns, Baker said. \"With (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi and her anti-gun minions in control of the House, we will see an uptick in PR stunts as the House passes every extreme gun-control measure under the sun,\" Baker said. \"But the fact remains: They do not have 60 votes in the Senate or an anti-gun President in the White House, so their theatrics will be geared towards fundraising and establishing the most liberal records for the 2020 primary election instead of doing their jobs.\" NRA officials say the focus on the Senate -- where Republicans have retained their power to confirm Trump's judicial picks -- already has paid off with the Supreme Court's recent decision to take up a gun-rights case for the first time since 2010.  That case centers on whether a New York City gun law, restricting where licensed handgun owners can travel with their firearms, violates the Second Amendment. By tackling the issue, the high court's newly reinforced conservative majority \"may finally re-energize a Second Amendment that has been neglected for too long,\" the NRA said in a statement.  The court will hear those arguments in the next term, which starts in October. And despite recent gains by gun-control advocates, few political observers doubt the NRA's ability to rapidly fill its coffers as the 2020 presidential contest heats up. In a video last week, NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch singled out the candidacy of Harris, a former California attorney general, as representing an \"existential threat\" to the Second Amendment.   Loesch then urged viewers to donate to the NRA, which she called \"the one organization powerful enough to disrupt the socialist plan to disarm America.\" Smart business? For many people who joined the gun-control movement in the past year, Parkland was a defining moment. Survivors led hundreds of thousands of protestors in March for Our Lives rallies around the country a little more than a month after the shooting. And some businesses began to reexamine their policies. Dick's Sporting Goods, for instance, removed assault-style rifles from its Field & Stream stores and stopped selling guns to anyone younger than 21. Walmart raised the age to purchase firearms to 21 from 18. Last September, the iconic denim brand Levi Strauss pledged $1 million to groups working to curb gun violence and partnered with Bloomberg to build a coalition of business executives committed to working on gun control. As a father, Mycoskie, the founder of Toms, said he had been shaken by the carnage in Parkland. Last November, however, the violence struck closer: 12 people were shot dead at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, just 15 minutes from his home. The following morning his wife, Heather, called him as he headed into Toms headquarters and said, \"'I'm scared, and I don't want to take our (four-year-old) son to school today,' \"Mycoskie recalled in a recent interview. \"She was very emotional and basically said that somebody has to do something about this.\" Within weeks, Toms had committed $5 million to groups working on gun violence, including Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense, a grassroots arm of Everytown for Gun Safety. He launched a postcard-writing campaign on the Toms website and in its stores, urging Congress to pass universal background checks. Mycoskie, 42, is no stranger to corporate activism. He started the shoe brand in 2006 with a mission of philanthropy and has donated shoes to more than 86 million people so far. The Toms eyeglass brand helps finance eyesight restoration; proceeds from its coffee-roasting operation help supply clean water in poor communities. Jumping into the gun debate was a new risk, however. For starters, the company's internal polling shows its customer base divides equally between Republicans and Democrats, Mycoskie said.  And corporations taking gun-safety stands have faced a backlash from gun owners and conservatives. Just last year, Georgia's Republican-controlled legislature blocked a tax break on jet fuel after Delta ended a discount-fare program with the NRA. (A few months later, then-Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, took executive action and halted collection of the tax.) \"What these corporations and billionaire politicians fail to realize is that the Second Amendment is in the hearts and minds of the American people,\" said Andrew Arulanandam, another NRA spokesman. But for some companies, the benefits of reaching a new segment of shoppers could outweigh the downsides. Millennials, defined by the Pew Research Center as those born between 1981 and 1996, are poised to overtake Baby Boomers as the nation's largest living generation this year. CNN's 2018 exit polling shows the highest level of support for gun control measures -- 66% -- among younger voters between the ages of 18 to 29. These generational differences underscore the \"upside potential\" on the gun issue for brands that appeal to a younger customer base, said Roger Beahm, executive director of the Center for Retail Innovation at Wake Forest University's School of Business.  \"Corporations have a finger in the wind and they are looking down the road -- what's the likely direction in the future?\" added Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at the State University of New York-Cortland, who has written five books on gun policy. \"Many have come to the conclusion that this a good step for them, precisely because it burnishes their social responsibility model,\" he said. Mycoskie said Toms draws on mothers on the \"older edge\" of the millennial generation for the biggest share of its customers, and, so far, the reaction to its gun activism seems mostly positive. The company's review of social media found that about 75% of customers back the move, and about 12% oppose it strongly and say they will boycott Toms brands. \"In theory, we lost about 12% of our customers, which is a big number in a business our size,\" he said. But Mycoskie said direct, e-commerce sales are up about 21% -- as people visit the website site to join the postcard campaign and start shopping while there. It's too soon, he said, to gauge the effect on wholesale orders, many of which were placed months before his background-check campaign began. \"We knew going in that if it got positioned as a highly political, left-leaning act that it would be very bad for business,\" he said. \"But we felt like we had to take that risk because the other risk we have is that we are a brand that is completely built on standing for something.\" \"When things like this happen and we don't act,\" he said, \"then there's also a large group of our customers who will lose faith in us.\"","81":"Jo Ann Jenkins is CEO of AARP and based in Washington DC. The opinions expressed in this commentary are the author's. View more opinion articles on CNN. If the recent Senate Finance Committee hearing in which the CEOs of several drug industry titans were called before Congress is any indication, big pharma will use its massive profits and lobbying clout to oppose any serious attempts to lower drug prices. After all, they've got a good thing going. Consider, for example, a recent study by the Public Policy Institute that found that annual retail prices for more than 100 top brand name medications used by chronic sufferers have, on average, more than tripled in cost since 2006. A medicine that cost $100 in 2006 now costs more than $300; a $400 medicine is now more than $1,200. To be clear, we're talking about the same medicines, just at more than three times the cost.  Meanwhile, people are suffering -- some more than others to be sure -- but few escape the deleterious effects of out-of-control drug prices. Last year, the average senior taking brand name drugs to treat chronic conditions faced more than $30,000 in drug costs. Sure, insurance (depending on the kind you have) covers some of that, but with 7.1 million older adults in the US living in poverty, too often older people face the grim reality of having to choose between paying for their medicines and paying for food or rent.   And if the last decade is anything to go on, what will these medicines cost a dozen or so years from now? Six times their current prices? If past is prologue, that's where we're headed.  So, what can be done?  Allow Medicare to negotiate on what it pays for prescription drugs  Currently, Medicare cannot negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. That's right, for some medicines, drug makers name their price and taxpayers pay it -- no questions asked. The time is now to enable the Health and Human Services Secretary to use the bargaining power of Medicare's more than 55 million beneficiaries to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices. Prohibit anti-competitive practices Brand name drug makers hate losing customers when another manufacturer is able to bring to market a generic drug that does the same thing for a lower cost, and there are lots of ways they try to reduce the competition. One of them is to pay the generic drug maker to delay bringing the drug to market for an agreed-upon time, usually measured in years. Another is to refuse to sell generic drug makers the samples of brand drugs that they need to conduct tests in order to demonstrate to Food and Drug Administration regulators that a generic is as effective as the brand name drug. So much for competition. Congress should act to stop these kinds of abuses that delay the availability of less-expensive generic drugs, costing the US billions of dollars.  Lower out-of-pocket costs  The combination of limited income and rising drug costs means many older Americans are struggling to afford the high out-of-pocket costs for expensive prescription drugs. Medicare Part D, which covers pharmacy costs, has an out-of-pocket limit of $5,100. But beneficiaries are still responsible for some costs even after they reach catastrophic coverage (which begins once you hit your out-of-pocket limit). And Medicare Part B, which covers doctors' treatments, does not limit out-of-pocket costs at all. The bottom line is that too many older people struggle financially just trying to maintain their health. It's time to lower or cap out-of-pocket costs. To be sure, none of these things on their own, or even in concert, will solve the problem of ever-skyrocketing prescription drug costs. There's also work to be done around importation, drug pricing transparency and more. But there's a lot that can -- and should -- be done now.  A lot of it is common sense, and the only parties who seek to obscure that are those with a vested interest in keeping things the way they are.  The Senate Finance Committee hearing on runaway prescription drug costs was a good start, but it's just that: a start. To provide citizens with drugs they can afford, we must take steps to limit the power of big pharma. ","82":"Washington (CNN)Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will face lawmakers on Thursday for his first public appearance since Democrats seized control of the House, a rendezvous that will likely include grillings on everything from tax refunds to Russian sanctions to whether he would agree to release President Donald Trump's tax returns. Trump's finance chief will appear in back-to-back hearings before the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee, following through on a pledge he made earlier this year to return to Capitol Hill after the President's fiscal 2020 budget was delivered to Congress on Monday.  Democrats have blasted Trump's proposed $4.7 trillion budget, the largest in history, as a \"gut punch\" to middle-class Americans that proposes \"malicious\" spending cuts to mandatory safety net programs like Medicare, student lending and nutritional assistance for low-income families, leaving Mnuchin to once again step in as defender-in-chief for the President. Under the new Congress, the secretary has had a rocky start with House Democrats, including a tense classified briefing in January on the administration's decision to de-list three Russian firms with close ties to Oleg Deripaska, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the closed-door meeting as a \"waste of time\" and \"one of the worst classified briefings\" she's ever received during the Trump administration.  Speaking to reporters following the briefing, Mnuchin expressed dismay, saying he was \"somewhat shocked\" by Pelosi's comments, arguing he had spent close to an hour and a half answering questions by House lawmakers. Members left him waiting for more than an hour in a secure room due to floor votes. A few weeks later, Mnuchin found himself in hot water again after refusing to testify before a House panel on a decision to bring more than 36,000 federal workers at the Internal Revenue Service back to work unpaid as the government shutdown dragged into tax season. Instead, the Treasury Department offered to have senior officials, including the deputy IRS commissioner, appear before the panel to answer questions, but not Mnuchin -- an offer the House panel ultimately declined. The timing of the request for Mnuchin to testify by Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Richard Neal, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, also raised questions at the time whether some Democrats were hoping to politically capitalize on the fact that their request would have conflicted with a previously scheduled trip to the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, where Mnuchin was expected to lead the US delegation. The White House, however, canceled the trip to the elite resort town in Switzerland shortly thereafter due to the government shutdown. Neal, the only Democrat who has the power to request Trump's tax returns, cleared the air with Mnuchin over a telephone call a few days later, ending the debacle with the secretary extending his willingness to appear before the committee at a \"mutually agreeable time\" after the President's budget was released. The chairman of the tax-writing committee told CNN this week he is \"still preparing\" his case and has yet to set a deadline to request the president's tax returns.  The episode came amid intensifying pressure by congressional Democrats, who have sent numerous letters to the secretary since the start of the year asking for further details on the Trump administration's controversial decision to rescind sanctions on Rusal, the world's second-largest aluminum producer, as well as EN+ Group and JSC EuroSibEnergo. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, and Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, wrote to Mnuchin in late January citing press reports asking how he managed his own potential personal and professional conflicts of interest with a major Rusal shareholder, Len Blavatnik. A second letter from California Democrat Rep. Jackie Speier also called into question how their relationship may have influenced the deal, with a Treasury spokesman at the time rebuking her concerns as \"premised on false information.\" Democrats have criticized the deal, arguing in their letter that Deripaska still retains \"significant influence, if not de facto control, over En+, Rusal and ESE\" through his associates and family members. California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the House Financial Services, has also been in talks with Mnuchin to appear before her committee on the issue. Mnuchin had also declined to initially testify in February after Treasury failed to meet the panel's document request on the matter. The two have spoken by phone and have agreed to work together to find a time for him to appear before the committee. The Democratic chairs of the House Financial Services, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees had sent a joint letter to Mnuchin, asking for a detailed accounting of the decision, noting \"the terms of removal are unusual and many questions remain unanswered.\"","83":"US Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat, is the chairman of the House Rules Committee, and a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He's also the sponsor of a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. The views expressed in this commentary are the author's own. View more opinion at CNN. Fast-forward to 2019, and things have only gotten worse. The Supreme Court's disastrous Citizens United decision in 2010 led to the rise of dark money groups (nonprofits that don't have to disclose their donors) and super PACs, political action committees that can accept unlimited contributions from individuals and corporations and spend it on behalf of candidates as long as they don't hand the money directly to them. It's notable that big corporate interests that donate generously to campaigns scored a huge tax break while middle class families were an afterthought in the 2017 Republican tax bill. Many Republicans also refused to act on climate change as extreme weather events ravaged communities and hurt our economy -- just what the wealthy CEOs of dirty energy companies would want. While most climate scientists agree that global warming is caused by human activity, many members of Congress seem to listen to the fossil fuel industry that fund their campaigns instead of the facts. This is not the political system our founders envisioned. Of course it takes money to win elections. But the never-ending fundraising required to win an election takes too much of our attention away from the real work of serving our constituents and our country. It also makes individuals who are not well off or well-connected think twice before running for office. That's why I'm proud that the new Democratic majority in the House proposed, as one of our first items of business, H.R. 1 -- a sweeping elections and campaign reform bill that will remove the roadblocks many eligible Americans face on their way to the ballot box and help end the dominance of big money in politics. As the new chairman of the House Rules Committee, I look forward to bringing H.R. 1 to the floor for debate. But I've also come to believe that I must do more than just support legislation to end the dominance of big money in politics. I need to change the way I run my own campaign fundraising. Over the past year, I've been asked by my constituents whether I would stop taking corporate PAC money for my campaign. I'll be honest -- at first, I was reluctant to consider such a big change. And It's important to state that I've never let a donation from anyone influence my vote. If corporate PACs have tried to buy my vote by cutting me a campaign check, they've ended up with a low return on their so-called investment. My voting record speaks for itself. Still, I was hesitant that I would put myself at a disadvantage against a well-funded opponent. But our country is in trouble. Our system is rigged to favor those at the top. And I believe the perception of corruption, even where it doesn't exist, must be addressed if we're going to restore faith in our government. My constituents want me to lead by example -- and I will. I will no longer take corporate PAC money for my campaign. It's what the people of Massachusetts' 2nd Congressional District want. And it's the right thing to do. I'm proud to join dozens of other members of Congress who have made this decision, including my Massachusetts colleagues Elizabeth Warren, Ayanna Pressley and Lori Trahan. I'm also grateful to the PAC End Citizens United, which is funded by grassroots supporters who hope to bring accountability and transparency back to Washington. Fundraisers, lobbyists and even some of my colleagues will surely tell me this is a terrible idea. They'll say the first rule of running for office is that you don't leave money on the table. As chairman of the Rules Committee -- a committee that touches every piece of major legislation that comes to the House floor -- I probably stand to lose a lot of campaign dollars. But when voters see economic policies that favor the rich, and inaction on climate change despite all the evidence of its impact, they're left wondering who politicians are working for. I don't want there to be any question about whom I'm working for. I think the public will reward this transparency. In November, citizens banded together to raise millions through small donations for candidates they believed in. Many of these $10 or $20 donations helped elect candidates who are now supporting H.R. 1. A government of the people and for the people should be funded by the people. Try as they may, Republicans will never succeed in convincing Americans that corporations are people. I'm proud to take this step to ensure there is no question as to whom I'm working for when I call the Rules Committee to order.","84":"Arlington, Virginia (CNN)There are no moldy pipes or electrical wires hanging from the ceiling in the new headquarters for President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign.   The walls aren't lined with an eclectic assortment of Trump swag and fan mail. There is no \"wall of shame\" exhibiting pictures of vanquished rivals. Staffers work at desks and in sleek, glass-doored offices rather than huddled behind plastic folding tables surrounded by unpainted dry wall.   In almost every way, the effort to re-elect Trump is a stark contrast to the insurgent, chaotic bid that propelled him to the White House in 2016. Moving out of the bare-bones production offices of \"The Apprentice\" in Trump Tower and into shiny, modern offices in the Washington suburbs is just the beginning.   Nearly 20 months out from the presidential election, the Trump campaign is already more organized and better-structured than its 2016 predecessor ever was. It's hired dozens of staffers, expanded its already impressive data operation, and begun to build out a formidable ground game across the country.  It's also raised (and spent) a record amount of money for a presidential re-election campaign at this stage. The campaign ended 2018 with $19 million in the bank, after raising more than $100 million alongside its joint fundraising committees over the first two years of Trump's presidency.   Perhaps the most significant difference is the relationship the campaign has with the Republican National Committee. Compared to the uneasy, bolted-on partnership forged in the final sprint to Election Day in 2016, the Trump campaign and RNC are now practically one entity. Under an unprecedented agreement announced earlier this year, the two merged their field operations and fundraising efforts and will share office space.   Under this setup, the RNC will pay for and provide much of the infrastructure, and the Trump campaign will call the shots.   The joint Trump\/RNC re-election outfit, Trump Victory, is already putting its ground game in motion, with two deputy political directors and nine of 10 regional field directors hired and plans to deploy state directors in all key battleground states by early this summer, two senior Trump campaign officials said.   The result, according to interviews with 16 Trump campaign officials, Republican operatives and White House officials, is a presidential re-election campaign unlike any other at this early stage. That's partly because the Trump campaign never actually ended. Trump filed for re-election just hours after his inauguration on January 20, 2017, something no other president has ever done.  Both Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush had been in office for more than two years before they filed for re-election. By getting out of the gate so early, the campaign has also been able to foot millions of dollars in legal fees \u2014 some to cover the expenses of the campaign and Trump associates caught up in federal and congressional investigations. The campaign and its supporting outside groups have also provided a soft landing spot for a handful of former White House aides and family members.   While Democrats are only just beginning their primary squabble, Trump campaign aides say they're sitting on a juggernaut. Whether Trump \u2014 who has a track record of sabotaging his aides' best-laid plans \u2014 takes full advantage of the operation remains to be seen.   In charge of it all is Brad Parscale, a 43-year-old, 6-foot-8 digital marketing executive who had no campaign experience until he was hired as the 2016 campaign's digital director. Before that, Parscale spent several years running an online marketing business and building websites, including for the Trump Organization.   Since Trump tapped him as campaign manager a year ago, Parscale has quietly developed a highly structured re-election organization that will be driven by a data-centric approach that reflects Parscale's digital marketing background.   \"We now have an operation and time to build that \u2014 a building that has proper desks in it and proper things,\" Parscale said in an interview with CNN. \"Last time \u2014 not for any fault of some of the people that run it \u2014 but it just was fly-by-night sometimes because it was going so fast.\" Parscale also has one key advantage he didn't last time: \"We already have the President of the United States,\" he says. \"We have the incumbency, we know where we're going.\" Still, he has his work cut out for him. Trump is among the most unpopular presidents in modern history, having never breached the 50% approval mark in polling averages. He's also under investigation on a number of fronts. Congressional and federal investigators are probing his administration as well as his business, his inauguration committee and his foundation. That's all helped fuel a tide of liberal enthusiasm that swept Democrats to victories in last year's midterms, including in many swing states that were critical to Trump's narrow path to victory in 2016.   To win, it's crucial that Parscale mobilizes Trump's avid core of supporters. The campaign is already turning its attention to addressing Rust Belt warning signs, with Trump planning to rally supporters in Michigan next week. It will be the 56th rally of his presidency, a staple of Trump's campaign style that will remain central to his 2020 effort.   Beyond data analytics, field operations, fundraising and advertising, the election will likely come down to voters' charged feelings about a controversial President. Parscale sees Trump as his ace in the hole.   \"When the President and this campaign gets ready to go full speed again, the President will turn on every ignition switch that's necessary to get the enthusiasm back. Anyone who doesn't think that this president will go 5 million miles an hour, day and night, to bring enthusiasm back and talk about what he can do next \u2014 they don't know him,\" Parscale said.     Turning rallies into \"real data machines\"   On a February night in El Paso, Texas, chants of \"build that wall!\" fill the El Paso County Coliseum as Parscale confidently strides onto the stage with a box of \"Make America Great Again\" hats under his arm. Without undoing the top button on his expertly tailored three-piece suit, he tosses several hats into the crowd before reaching for the microphone.   \"I am feeling the enthusiasm in here tonight! You gotta understand, though, this is our first rally for this presidential cycle, so you guys gotta be extra loud today,\" Parscale says as the crowd breaks into a raucous cheer.   Parscale has become a staple of the pre-programming at Trump rallies \u2014 a stark departure from the behind-the-scenes role he played in 2016 running the campaign's digital operation.   In that role, Parscale pushed the campaign to spend half its ad budget online, a move that initially left Trump fuming at Parscale, but is now one of the reasons he sits atop the campaign. Already in 2019, the Trump campaign has spent $3.5 million on Facebook ads and another $1 million on Google, according to public spending data analyzed by communications firm Bully Pulpit Interactive. That's nearly double the combined online ad spending for the full Democratic field of presidential candidates.   Back in 2016, that sort of precise targeting of voters through digital ads would not have worked without the RNC's data operation, the byproduct of a multimillion-dollar investment spurred by the Republican defeat in 2012. RNC operatives credit Parscale with encouraging Trump campaign officials to use what they'd built.   \"Brad was able to go through the hierarchy up to the President, with Jared (Kushner), with (Steve) Bannon with Kellyanne (Conway), with everybody...and he was able to go and say, I looked under the hood and they have this amazing machine,\" a former senior RNC official said.   Now campaign manager, Parscale is putting data at the core of the re-election campaign's efforts. Standing at the lectern in El Paso, Parscale quickly reveals his true interest in these rallies when he whips out his phone and asks the crowd to \"text WALL\" to a specific phone number.   \"That's how we can connect with you and that's very important to helping us win in 2020,\" Parscale explains as he entices the crowd with a sweepstakes-like promises of free campaign swag.   Just like in 2016, the campaign is capitalizing on Trump's ability to draw thousands of supporters \u2014 many of whom are infrequent voters or non-traditional Republicans \u2014 to expand their voter data files and improve turnout. Now, the campaign is focused on getting even more granular data out of rallies and marshaling that energy into volunteer work, turning the rallies into \"real data machines,\" as Parscale says.   The El Paso rally is an important step in that direction. Outside the coliseum, volunteers use handheld electronic ticket scanners for the first time to confirm which supporters have actually shown up, instead of simply tracking which ones sign up for a ticket on Eventbrite. With this data in hand, the campaign determines that half the rally attendees are registered Democrats, and that 23% hadn't voted in any of the last four elections \u2014 crucial information in identifying voters it might not have otherwise known to target.   The scanners also give the campaign access to the phone numbers of some of Trump's most motivated supporters, which the campaign plans to use to boost its ranks of volunteers \u2014 something they felt was a shortcoming of the 2016 campaign, two senior Trump campaign officials said.   \"What we did not do a good enough job of was to activate them into their neighborhoods,\" Trump campaign political director Chris Carr said of rallygoers in 2016. \"That's what we're going to do this cycle. Because when we activate them into their neighborhoods, it just grows. The army (of volunteers) grows.\"    The campaign is aiming to have at least 1.5 million volunteers for the presidential election, a senior campaign official said. There's even an app that's in development.   \"We need to give them digital technology right on their phone,\" says Parscale. \"As they're waiting for the President, while they're standing outside or a couple of days before when they're excited, they're interested, they're peaking of, 'I'm going to go see the President' and say, 'Hey, here are some activities we'd like you to do.'\"     If there's one aspect of the re-election operation that Trump campaign and RNC officials are most confident in, it's their data operation. It was crucial in helping to steer digital advertising dollars with precision and direct resources to midwestern states that proved to be the difference. Now, the Trump campaign and RNC have had two years to improve their synergy, collect more voter data and perfect their voter targeting, and they believe they have a critical edge over Democrats.   Republicans' voter database has long lived in a shared data exchange called The Data Trust, which allows a slew of Republican groups \u2014 from campaigns to state parties and even super PACs \u2014 to feed in and extract voter information. Democrats \u2014 whose data analytics outpaced Republicans' in 2008 and 2012 \u2014 are now playing catch up.    \"I think, right now, we're not competitive,\" said former Gov. Howard Dean, a former presidential candidate and DNC chairman who has been tasked by the Democratic National Committee with creating the Democrats' version of The Data Trust. \"They've been doing this the right way for two cycles and you know the DNC has really started out in a hole. You know, we have basically 12 months or so to get us in shape.\"   \"I'm not the least bit panicked about it, but we don't have a lot of time,\" he added.   Conductor of the Trump train   Standing outside the coliseum in El Paso, Parscale towers over the crowd. He's popped outside for a few minutes to survey the snaking line of supporters, knowing that the President will ask him about the crowd size when he shows up in three hours, especially with the Democratic sensation and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke leading a counter-rally just a few blocks away.   \"I want to make sure we fill it and I want to see how much we back-fill it outside,\" Parscale says, before predicting 8,000 supporters will fit inside the 6,500-capacity coliseum. Even that hyperbole wasn't satisfactory for Trump. That night from the stage he claimed that, with the help of the fire department, 10,000 people fit inside the coliseum, a claim the fire department later denied.   While Parscale's height might give him an edge in the eyes of Trump, who famously likes to surround himself with tall people, it's not the reason he has his current job.   The unconventional selection was borne largely out of Parscale's close relationship with the President's family, namely Eric Trump and Jared Kushner. Eric initially hired Parscale in 2011 to build websites for the Trump Organization. Kushner recognized his digital savvy during the 2016 campaign, quietly elevating the Trump campaign digital director to a role that many on the campaign likened to that of a deputy campaign manager.   Parscale is almost universally well-liked and respected inside Trumpworld, a rarity considering it's rife with intense rivalries and backstabbing, though two sources familiar with the matter reported tension between Trump's 2016 campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and Parscale. In an effort to keep the peace, Parscale recently began convening a regular \"kitchen cabinet\" conference call with a group of former top Trump campaign officials and informal political advisers, from Lewandowski to pro-Trump activist Charlie Kirk, seeking their input and sharing updates about the campaign, two sources familiar with the calls said.   The Kansas native-turned-Texas transplant also knows where he stands vis-\u00e0-vis Trump.   \"I've always said, he's the campaign manager, the communications director, the finance director \u2014 he is the master of the Trump train and I'm a conductor on it,\" Parscale says back in the campaign offices.   Parscale typically speaks with the President at least once a week by phone, two sources familiar with the matter said. He talks to Kushner nearly every day. The President's son-in-law has been a quiet force behind many of the campaign's early efforts to prepare for 2020 and will serve as Trump's primary go-between with the campaign.   In 2016, Trump micromanaged much of his campaign , and he is already keeping close tabs on the re-election effort. Multiple sources close to the President said he will be the ultimate driver of his re-election strategy.   During a recent meeting in the White House residence where Trump campaign officials outlined the structure of the campaign for the President and vice president, Trump was locked in, two sources who attended the meeting said, even as the meeting stretched for an hour and a half.   Trump also flashed his penchant for keeping a close eye on the money, cheering the forthcoming hire of an in-house legal counsel, which is aimed at reducing the campaign's legal bills.   \"I love that!\" Trump exclaimed, the two sources said.   The road to Charlotte   While nearly nine in 10 Republicans tell pollsters they approve of Trump's job as President, his presidency has provoked more intra-Republican bloodletting than any other in modern history. Since he took office, there has been rampant speculation about which Republican would mount a primary challenge.   So far it's just one\u2014 former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who ran for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016. Former Ohio governor and CNN senior political commentator John Kasich is said to still be mulling a possible primary challenge, and Maryland's Gov. Larry Hogan has recently emerged as a possible alternative.   The campaign isn't leaving anything to chance, and is working hard to close off as many pathways to the RNC convention floor as possible.   Two former White House officials, Bill Stepien and Justin Clark, are heading up a small team of Trump campaign officials whose singular mission is to ensure the 2020 RNC convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, is \"drama-free.\"   They have already hit the ground, heading off any cracks in support for the President at the state party level by working to ensure that RNC convention delegates and state party chairs elected this year are reliably pro-Trump.   At the national level, the merger between the Trump campaign and RNC is sending a powerful message that Trump and the Republican Party are synonymous. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel has proved a fierce defender of the President, even firing off missives at her uncle, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, after he penned an op-ed critical of Trump. The RNC has since also installed Tommy Hicks, Jr., a Texas businessman and close friend of the President's eldest son, as co-chairman.     While part of the campaign's team is focused on heading off primary challenges, the campaign and the RNC are focused on building out a formidable general election ground operation.   Led by Carr, the political director, the campaign is planning to deploy staff into key battleground states by early this summer, a full year before the two parties formally nominate their candidates for the general election.   The campaign has hired regional directors for all but the upper Midwest region and is preparing to hire state directors who will manage the Trump campaign and RNC efforts in each state. Carr is requiring all state directors to undergo and pass a weeklong training course this spring before they are hired \u2014 even if they already currently serve as RNC state directors, according to a senior Trump campaign official.   The deployments will allow the campaign to turn its attention early on to engaging and deploying field workers and volunteers into \"turfs,\" territories comprised of 15,000 households the Trump campaign plans to target in 2020. Residents in those households are either fervent Trump supporters who vote infrequently or reliable voters who are leaning toward supporting Trump but are not yet \"in the bank,\" in the words of a senior Trump campaign official.   It's a similar effort to the ground game the RNC ran in 2016 \u2014 except this time it is beginning early, and supercharged.    The money   None of this would be possible without raising a record amount of money. The Trump campaign and its affiliated committees have raked in nearly $130 million over the past two years. That's given it a financial advantage that Trump campaign officials say will allow them to vigorously compete in more states than they did in 2016.   A super PAC and nonprofit organization supporting Trump \u2014 America First Action and America First Policies \u2014 raised an additional $75 million, according to a spokeswoman for the combined America First operation. Both are closely aligned with the President, with a coterie of former Trump aides helping to develop them. Parscale is one of the founders of America First Policies but is no longer involved.    The super PAC, America First Action, spent heavily on ads to boost Republican candidates in 2018, burning through most of its money. The organization also serves as home to some key Trump loyalists, including former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who serves as a senior adviser and spokesman for the group, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host who is dating the President's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Guilfoyle is the group's vice chairwoman.   For all of its fundraising prowess, the Trump campaign has burned through donors' contributions at a fast clip.   In the last three months of 2018 alone, according to a CNN review of FEC records, the campaign spent $23 million \u2014 exceeding the $21 million that Trump and his political operation with the RNC raised in that time. The campaign plowed nearly a third of its money \u2014 $8 million \u2014 into advertising, as it worked to boost its data gathering and drive support for Republicans in the midterm elections. Another $2 million went to purchasing campaign swag \u2014 the T-shirts, mugs, stickers and \"Make America Great Again\" hats \u2014 that his avid supporters snap up.     Over the past two years, some of the campaign's money has flowed directly to Parscale's own businesses. Between the Trump campaign and the RNC, Parscale's firms have pulled in more than $21 million for services including digital consulting, online advertising and fundraising.   Parscale has said that much of that money goes directly toward purchasing advertising and other expenses, but he declined to provide a detailed accounting of the spending and how much he has profited from his business with the RNC and Trump campaign.   He points out that unlike other political consultants, he will not earn a percentage of the campaign's ad buys, instead agreeing to a $300,000 annual retainer with the campaign, plus bonuses.   \"In the last election, I was hired as an advertising agency and we received a percentage. After that, I felt like as campaign manager it would seem not very ethical and very good of myself to pay myself a percentage for my own decisions,\" Parscale said. \"I know a lot of guys in this industry that do that. I feel differently about it.\"     Legal Fees The campaign's fundraising has also served another crucial function: paying the legal bills of Trump campaign officials and family members.   In the first two years of Trump's presidency, donors to the Trump campaign have underwritten more than $6.7 million in legal expenses \u2014 more than $1 out of every $10 the campaign has spent on operating costs \u2014 at a time when the President, his family and aides have had to respond to federal and congressional investigations stemming from Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.   That's nearly as much at the $7.4 million President Barack Obama's campaign spent on legal services during the entire eight years of his presidency, according to a CNN analysis of Federal Election Commission records. The bulk of the campaign's spending on legal fees \u2014 nearly $4.4 million \u2014 has gone to the law firm Jones Day, which handles the campaign's FEC compliance and document request matters. Almost all the remaining $2.3 million has flowed to other law firms, several of which represent Trump campaign officials and Trump family members swept up in the Russia-related investigations.   More than $317,000 of those legal expenses have been paid out to firms representing Donald Trump Jr., who brokered the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting in the summer of 2016 with a Russian lawyer promising \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government.   And firms representing former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, former Trump bodyguard Keith Schiller and Kushner have been paid nearly $366,000 by the campaign. A spokesman for Kushner's attorney said payments to his firm were related to the DNC's lawsuit against Trump's campaign officials, including Kushner. Back at its gleaming new office space in Virginia, Parscale proudly claims the campaign saved hundreds of thousands of dollars by subleasing a fully furnished office \u2014 which was a trading floor for a financial company \u2014 after that company was purchased and downsized. Savings aside, some Trump political advisers worry the campaign will lose the \"start-up mentality\" that defined Trump's stunning 2016 victory as it becomes a more traditional national campaign \u2014 modern office space and all. \"You kind of still have to keep that \u2014 I don't want to say fly by the seat of your pants \u2014 but that's what made this campaign very successful,\" one Republican operative close to the campaign said. \"You don't want to have a thousand layers and become some giant corporation where you can't make a decision.\"   Parscale is mindful of the criticism and wary of the campaign being cast as too \"traditional.\" This won't be a campaign that will grow to \"400 employees in 400 offices across America,\" he says.   And if there's anything he can lean on to make his case, it's his own nontraditional background.   \"I don't think there's anything traditional about me,\" he said. \"I think that I was the right hybrid for the President.\"","85":" (CNN)Even by the combustible standards of Donald Trump, the spectacle set to unfold around his presidency in time zones 12 hours apart in the next few days could defy description. On one side of the planet, Michael Cohen, the President's former personal lawyer, is expected to dish dirt in a congressional hearing on Trump's turbulent personal and business affairs that are becoming an increasing legal and political threat. On the other side in Vietnam, Trump will be pursuing a Nobel Peace Prize, convening a second summit and media extravaganza with North Korean tyrant Kim Jong Un that will take place despite a lack of genuine progress since their first encounter. Trump is giving the talks top billing. He said at the White House on Sunday night that he has a \"very, very good relationship\" with Kim. \"We see eye to eye, I believe,\" Trump said. Yet Cohen's appearance, if it brings significant revelations and congressional fireworks, is likely to complicate and detract from Trump's efforts to orchestrate an international peace pageant at the summit in Hanoi, and could also inflict serious political damage on the President even as he is out of the country. In another sign of the controversy perpetually swirling around this White House, House Democrats will meanwhile vote on Tuesday on a resolution to terminate what they say is Trump's \"lawless\" state of emergency declared to finance his border wall. The move will impose new pressure on Senate Republicans and could eventually draw a presidential veto. And hovering over everything will be the expectation that once the President is back home, special counsel Robert Mueller will soon file a report that could have grave implications for the Trump presidency. How the Cohen show may upstage the Kim sit-down Perhaps only in the age of Trump could a nuclear summit between a President and the tyrant leader of a hermit nation with which the US has been technically at war for nearly 70 years be the second biggest news story of the week. Cohen's testimony before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday has the potential to be a historic moment in the Trump administration and to thicken the cloud of sleaze that has engulfed his White House. According to the Democratic leadership of the committee, Cohen, who once served as Trump's fixer, will discuss \"debts and payments relating to efforts to influence the 2016 election.\" That subject will include payments made by Cohen to buy the silence of two women who claimed they had affairs with the President, which Trump has denied multiple times. Cohen says Trump directed him to make the payments in a scheme that his former attorney claims was an attempt to influence the 2016 election, a potential breach of campaign finance laws. Cohen, who once guarded the secrets of the Trump empire, is also expected to testify about \"potentially fraudulent or inappropriate practices by the Trump Foundation\" \u2014 the subject of a civil lawsuit brought by the New York Attorney General's Office. On Friday, the New York Times reported that Cohen had given information about possible irregularities in Trump's family businesses to prosecutors in New York in a move that reflects the President's growing legal peril. What Cohen may say Democrats on the committee may also ask whether Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress about a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, one of the crimes for which the attorney will shortly go to prison. It is not clear whether the Department of Justice or the special counsel have directed Cohen not to address any specific questions given that they could be germane to Mueller's continuing investigation. But House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, said Cohen will talk about \"public efforts by the President and his attorney to intimidate Mr. Cohen or others not to testify\" after the lawyer canceled an earlier appearance saying he feared for his family's safety. Intimidating witnesses, as Cohen claims the President did, and trying to get a witness to lie to Congress, are offenses that could potentially be investigated in any impeachment proceedings initiated by House Democrats against Trump. \"Looking forward to the #American people hearing my story in my voice! #truth,\" Cohen wrote on Twitter last week. Trump insisted that he has no concerns about what may unfold in room 2154 of the Rayburn House Office Building on Wednesday, in a somewhat oblique comment on Friday. \"No, no, no,\" Trump said. \"'Lawyer\/client,' but, you know, he's taking his own chances.\" The White House and Republicans will assail Cohen's testimony by pointing out that he is already an admitted liar and that everything he says should be dismissed. So the question of whether he can corroborate his claims about Trump will be critical. \"No one should be scared of the truth, but everyone should be scared when the deck is stacked in favor of a liar,\" Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee said in a statement last week. Extreme pressure on Trump for results Cohen's appearance will take place in the middle of Trump's visit to Hanoi where he will meet Kim for private one-on-one talks, and negotiations with delegations. That means that any bombshells in Washington could disrupt Trump's efforts to grab center stage for the meeting and force him to address any such issues if he talks to reporters. That the summit itself is going ahead at all is controversial since Trump has arguably not extracted any concrete progress since last year's Singapore summit, despite making several significant concessions. The White House insists that a lack of missile or nuclear tests by the isolated state and the return of the remains of 55 US war dead from the Korean War are significant steps. Trump has claimed hyperbolically that his predecessor Barack Obama was close to \"a big war\" with North Korea \u2014 an argument that the former President's national security team has refuted. Ahead of the summit, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders downplayed expectations and accused the media of using the summit to attack the President. \"He's had great success here in the fact that they were even able to sit down at the table. The fact that he's able to do it again is in itself a big success,\" she said. It's a fair point that talking to the North Koreans and reducing tensions is a worthy goal and makes Americans safer. And if Trump convinces Kim to verifiably give up nuclear weapons, he would deserve the praise that history would heap on him for an achievement no other President managed. But there is extreme pressure on Trump to produce something tangible from the summit after Kim agreed at the first to \"work toward complete denuclearization\" of the Korean peninsula but has so far failed to follow through. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats angered Trump last month by saying in congressional testimony that US spy agencies assess that North Korea will seek to retain its weapons of mass destruction and is unlikely to completely give up nuclear weapons and production facilities because its leaders view the arsenal as \"critical to regime survival.\" Pompeo on the spot After the Singapore summit last year, where he became the first US President to meet a North Korean leader, Trump tweeted the false claim that \"There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.\"  But so far there is not even a common definition agreed by each side about the core issue. A senior White House official told reporters last week that one of the goals of the summit would be to develop a \"shared understanding of what denuclearization means.\" In an exchange with CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sought to reconcile the President's misleading rhetoric with the reality of North Korean intransigence. \"Do you think North Korea remains a nuclear threat?\" Tapper asked. \"Yes,\" Pompeo replied, promoting Tapper to point out: \"The president said he doesn't.\" \"That's not what he said,\" Pompeo said, before Tapper quoted Trump's tweet. \"What he said was that the efforts that had been made in Singapore, this commitment that Chairman Kim, may have substantially taken down the risk to the American people.\" Tapper replied ... \"OK.  I mean, that's just a direct quote, but I want to move on.\" There is palpable anxiety in the foreign policy community and even inside the White House that Trump's desperation for a win in Hanoi could lead him to make substantial concessions that could further weaken US leverage. That temptation could be all the greater if Cohen steals the show. In Singapore, Trump shocked US allies and his own officials by freezing US-South Korea military exercises in what was seen as a big win for Kim \u2014 but which has not unlocked key concessions from Pyongyang. This time there are signs that Washington is prepared to water down one of its previous demands that the North provide a full inventory of its nuclear and missile programs ahead of any new US concessions. Some experts believe that Trump could try to smoke Kim out this time by offering to exchange liaison offices in the two nation's capitals, or by agreeing to a peace declaration to formally end the Korean War. The latter move would satisfy Trump's need for an eye-catching PR coup after his open campaigning for a Nobel Peace Prize, but it would have huge implications since it would weaken the case for US troops staying in South Korea. US officials have insisted that the US garrison is not on the table in the summit.","86":"Washington (CNN)Democratic lawmakers pressed the National Rifle Association for more information around millions of dollars in donations the group funneled towards the campaigns of President Donald Trump and Republican congressional candidates in a letter to the NRA's president Wednesday. The letter, from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse and Rep. Jamie Raskin, follows a series of news reports that raised questions about the NRA's relationship with apparent shell companies that purchased political ads in potential violation of campaign finance law.  According to those reports -- which appeared in outlets including Politico, The Daily Beast and The Trace, a digital news organization funded in part by money from a gun control group -- the NRA doled out more than $50 million in support of Trump's 2016 campaign, and more than $25 million for Republican candidates in 2014, through political consulting firms that were connected to firms employed by the Republican campaigns, suggesting illegal coordination between the NRA and the campaigns, the lawmakers write.  \"Any expenditure made in coordination with a candidate is considered to be an in-kind contribution to the candidate,\" Whitehouse and Raskin write. \"The relationship between the firms the NRA employed and the firms the Trump Campaign and other Republican candidates used suggests illegal coordination.\" Advocacy groups, including the gun control legal group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords, have filed a number of complaints with the Federal Elections Commission detailing the alleged violations.  In their letter, the lawmakers ask the NRA for documentation and communications around the group's policies to comply with federal and state campaign finance law, as well as communications between the NRA and a number of political consulting firms the group reportedly paid to support the Republican candidates. The lawmakers also wrote similar letters to the political consulting firms requesting documents. Whitehouse and Raskin put a deadline of March 6 on their requests. A representative for the NRA's outside counsel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ","87":"Washington (CNN)Michael Cohen, the one-time personal attorney and fixer to President Donald Trump, on Wednesday presented an extensive set of his former boss's possible criminal liabilities that Cohen described as under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York. In public testimony before Congress, Cohen provided fresh details about Trump's participation in Cohen's campaign finance crimes, including steps that occurred after Trump took office, and revealed that prosecutors are investigating other unspecified criminal activity by Trump. Cohen also told the House Oversight Committee that Trump Organization executives, including the President's son Donald Trump Jr. and Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg, participated in what prosecutors have described in court documents as a scheme to reimburse Cohen for a $130,000 payment he made to silence an adult-film actress, Stormy Daniels, who claimed an affair with Trump. And Cohen testified that Trump had an arrangement stretching back more than a decade with David Pecker, the CEO of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer tabloid, to eliminate stories that could prove detrimental to Trump if published. In an effort to corroborate his claims, particularly those concerning an alleged reimbursement payment by Trump himself, Cohen came armed with copies of checks. One, dated August 2017, seven months after Trump was sworn into office, came from Trump's personal bank account and appeared to showed Trump's distinctive signature authorizing what Cohen testified was partial reimbursement by the sitting President. RELATED: This billionaire reportedly paid $60K for a portrait of Trump.  Cohen's testimony dramatically expanded the scope of what is publicly known about New York federal prosecutors' examination of the President, his company and his family.  Prior to Wednesday, prosecutors in the Southern District of New York were known to have been examining whether any Trump Org executives violated campaign-finance laws as part of the scheme to reimburse Cohen and had been conducting an investigation of the Trump inaugural committee, CNN has reported. On Wednesday, Cohen suggested they are also examining a conversation he had with Trump in the spring of 2018, within two months of the FBI having executed search warrants on Cohen's home, hotel room and office. After telling the committee that conversation was the last time Cohen spoke to Trump, Cohen said he couldn't speak further about that matter because it is under investigation by prosecutors. \"I've been asked by them not to discuss and not to talk about these issues,\" Cohen said. Minutes later, Cohen was asked: \"Is there any other wrongdoing or illegal acts that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven't yet discussed today?\" Cohen replied: \"Yes, and again those are part of the investigation that's currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York.\" At another point, Cohen disclosed: \"I am in constant contact with the Southern District of New York regarding ongoing investigations.\" RELATED: How Michael Cohen says Trump cheated on his net worth A spokesman for the US Attorney's Office declined to comment on Cohen's testimony. Stormy Daniels payment another legal problem for Trump The newly disclosed investigative efforts aren't the only aspect of Cohen's testimony that may spell significant legal trouble for Trump. For the first time, Cohen publicly described in great detail Trump's participation in and direction of Cohen's payment to Daniels and the effort to reimburse him for that payment.  Cohen told the committee that in 2016, when Cohen was engaged in discussions with Daniels's then-attorney about whether to pay Daniels to remain silent, \"what I did each and every time is go straight into Mr. Trump's office and discuss the issue with him.\" Days before the election, when a leaked tape of Trump making crude comments about women on the set of \"Access Hollywood\" created what Cohen described in his testimony as a \"wildfire,\" Cohen said he met with Trump and Weisselberg in Trump's office, and Trump decided to pay Daniels. \"He acknowledged to Allen that he was going to pay the $130,000, and that Allen and I should go back to his office and figure out how to do it,\" Cohen said. According to Cohen, he asked Weisselberg to use his own money to pay Daniels. After Weisselberg said he couldn't, Cohen said, Weisselberg suggested to Cohen that the two find someone who \"wants to have a party at one of his clubs that could pay me instead, or somebody who may have wanted to become a member of one of the golf clubs.\" After concluding that they didn't know anyone who could cover for them in such a manner, Cohen said he decided to use his home-equity line of credit to make the Daniels payment. Trump knew of and approved that step, as well as the entire reimbursement scheme, Cohen said. \"Oh, he knew about everything, yes,\" Cohen told the committee. Federal prosecutors have previously explained the scheme in court filings, saying that Cohen falsely submitted invoices to the Trump Organization at the direction of \"executives\" of the company during the year 2017, for a total of $420,000. The reimbursement was paid in monthly installments of $35,000, according to prosecutors. In court filings, prosecutors cited two company executives (\"Executive-1\" and \"Executive-2\") who were involved in the reimbursement scheme, but didn't name them. On Wednesday, Cohen testified that he \"believed\" that Weisselberg, who had limited immunity and provided information to investigators, is \"Executive-1\" and that Trump Jr. is \"Executive-2.\" Cohen also made public a copy of what he said was one of the $35,000 reimbursement checks, signed by Weisselberg and Trump Jr. \"Are you telling us, Mr. Cohen, that the President directed transactions in conspiracy with Allen Weisselberg and his son, Donald Trump Jr., as part of ... a criminal conspiracy of financial fraud? Is that your testimony today?\" Rep. Ro Khanna asked. \"Yes,\" Cohen replied. An attorney for Trump Jr. declined to comment on Cohen's claims. \"Is there any doubt that President Trump knew exactly what he was paying for?\" Cohen was asked at another point in the hearing. \"There is no doubt in my mind,\" Cohen said. Though federal prosecutors didn't reference a check from Trump in their charges against Cohen, they obtained evidence of such a from Trump's personal account during their investigation, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Catch-and-kill Cohen also resurfaced details of Trump's efforts to suppress unflattering stories with the help of Pecker, who received immunity from prosecutors.  Cohen testified that Pecker had helped kill a prospective story on an alleged Trump love child. A tip about that story was obtained by AMI, but the story was never published by the National Enquirer after AMI paid $30,000 in August 2015 to a former doorman at Trump World Tower, Dino Sajudin, who was selling the rights to what he claimed was information that Trump had fathered a child with a former employee. No outlets, including CNN, have found any evidence to support the allegation about the child. The $30,000 contract, however, was scrutinized by federal prosecutors in New York in the spring of 2018 as a third hush money payment, according to people familiar with the matter. Cohen had told media outlets that his involvement in the matter was limited to trying as Trump's spokesman to tamp down what AMI said were its efforts to confirm Sajudin's tip. But in fact, Cohen was involved much earlier in the process than previously known, people familiar with the matter said, and helped engineer the contract between AMI and Sajudin in the same manner he later orchestrated another hush money contract to an ex-Playboy model, Karen McDougal, according to two people involved in the process. Investigators ultimately decided against charging it as a crime. It's not clear why prosecutors didn't pursue charges over the Sajudin contract, but former officials from the Southern District of New York suggested that prosecutors may have considered the timing of the contract to be too far removed from Election Day to make as compelling of a case as the payments to McDougal and Daniels.","88":"New York (CNN Business)The Federal Reserve made a mistake when it raised interest rates in December, but that could be good news for the stock market, according to Wharton School finance professor Jeremy Siegel. Siegel is confident the Fed recognizes it makes more sense to be \"patient,\" and the central bank is not going to keep hiking rates this year. He also believes a recession is not imminent in the United Sates, even though the economy is likely to slow. The market should react positively to that. Siegel has said in recent interviews on CNBC and SiriusXM that the market turmoil of late 2018 has helped bring down valuations to more reasonable levels.  He thinks stocks could post a decent 2019, with gains of between 5% and 15% for the broader market.

","89":"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump said Friday he doesn't see car imports as a national security threat, even though he has considered using national security justifications to slap tariffs on foreign automobiles and auto parts.  \"Well, no,\" Trump said when Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo asked if auto imports threaten the United States. \"What poses a national security risk is our balance sheet,\" he said, pointing to trade deficits with the European Union. Trump's comments could provide fodder for legal challenges from the auto industry if he follows through on the tariffs he promised last year.  Some companies harmed by his steel and aluminum tariffs last year have pushed back in the courts, arguing the President abused the Section 232 authority. Another more fundamental challenge from an alliance of steel importers makes the case that the power was improperly delegated to the White House when Congress passed the law in the first place. Trump received a report from the Commerce Department last month about using the Cold War-era provision to impose tariffs on auto imports. The report has so far been kept secret, frustrating members of Congress who have pushed back on the threatened tariffs.  A dozen senators led by Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey, Alabama Democrat Doug Jones and Maine Independent Angus King sent a letter on Friday urging the Commerce Department to publish its findings and to answer key questions about its methods.  Trump has until the middle of May to decide whether to impose the trade restrictions or not. He has repeatedly threatened to target the European Union with auto tariffs, and pressure is ramping up as negotiations for a bilateral trade deal with the United States have hit a wall due to the parties' intractable differences on agricultural products. The EU \"frankly treats us as badly as China,\" Trump said in the interview. Although Trump agreed to a tariff ceasefire with the EU in July, unity was short lived. The White House now wants a comprehensive agreement that would open up European markets to American agricultural products, despite the EU's unwavering demand that the deal avoid agriculture altogether. Trump's top trade negotiator acknowledged at a hearing on March 12 that the two sides had reached \"a complete stalemate\" over the scope of the deal. Opponents say auto tariffs would disrupt global supply chains, hurt consumers and punish American manufacturers who depend on imported auto parts. A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers has recently called for legislation to curb Trump's power to impose the tariffs without congressional approval, and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, says he is working on a compromise bill to address the matter.  The President has been unaffected by their concerns. \"Sure, it does,\" Trump said when Bartiromo asked about the potential negative impacts of auto tariffs. \"But you know what it does? I'll tell you what the end game is: They'll build their plants in the United States. Then they have no tariffs.\" He pointed specifically to Mercedes Benz and BMW. \"I want them to make them here. Instead of making them over there, make them here. If you're going to sell them to the Americans, make them here,\" the President argued. BMW has a plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Mercedes-Benz operates a plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  Trump also addressed ongoing talks with China during the interview.  \"The deal will probably happen. I think they need it very badly,\" he said. Earlier this week, Trump said current tariffs on China could remain \"for a substantial period of time,\" even if a deal is reached. \"We have to make sure that if we do the deal with China that China lives by the deal because they've had a lot of problems living by certain deals,\" he remarked on Wednesday. Negotiations between the world's two largest economies will continue next week when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer go to Beijing. \"We're getting very close,\" the President said. \"That doesn't mean we get there. But we're getting very close.\"","90":"Washington (CNN)Michael Cohen's testimony Wednesday represented the biggest moment to date for House Democrats and their sweeping investigation into every aspect of President Donald Trump's life. Cohen implicated Trump on numerous fronts, from hush-money payments during the campaign to financial shenanigans at the Trump Organization to orchestrating lies while he was in the Oval Office. And he maligned the President's character, calling him a \"racist\" and a \"conman.\"  Republicans and the White House dismissed Cohen, calling him a convicted liar motivated by greed. But the hearing made clear that Cohen's allegations will be a jumping off point for Democrats to probe deeper into Trump's world. Here are six takeaways from Cohen's hearing: Cohen's remarkable accusations For the first time in a nationally televised setting, Cohen accused the President of directing him to commit the crimes he pleaded guilty to last year when he paid hush money to women alleging they had affairs with Trump. But Cohen went further than that. He displayed a copy of the check that Trump signed to reimburse him, and he said that Trump told him to lie publicly in February 2018 that Trump had any knowledge of the payment.  Beyond that, Cohen claimed Roger Stone told Trump that he has spoken to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and there would be an email leak forthcoming. And he explained why he thought Donald Trump Jr. had told his father in advance about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer promising dirt on Hillary Clinton.  Those charges weren't as solid, however, as the allegations involving the payments to women, which in a vacuum -- a presidential candidate directing payments to silence women alleging affairs -- is a remarkable accusation. It underscores the notion that Trump's campaign finance issues could ultimately prove to be his biggest potential liability. Cohen also said he could not discuss his last conversation with Trump that occurred after the FBI raid of his offices, citing an ongoing investigation from federal prosecutors in New York. Trump's former lawyer said he was \"aware\" of wrongdoing or illegal acts that involved Trump, but he could not talk about them because they are currently under investigation. Road map for ongoing investigation Cohen's testimony showed plenty of possible exposure for those in Trump's orbit on several fronts. Several Trump associates are likely to be hearing from Congress soon enough -- most notably Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg -- as multiple Democrats asked Cohen to name names when it came to questions about Trump's finances. Cohen provided financial statements from 2011 and 2013 given to Deutsche Bank in an attempt to ask about a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills, suggesting Trump inflated his income when it suited his interests. Cohen told Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that Trump had also provided inflated assets to an insurance company, which the New York Democrat said was a reason that Congress should see Trump's financial statements and tax returns. Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Massachusetts, said the hearing could help give the Ways and Means Committee \"probable cause\" to subpoena Trump's tax records. Cummings said after the hearing that he would \"probably\" bring in both Weisselberg and Trump Jr. for questioning. Republicans' game plan: attack, attack, attack Republicans came into Wednesday's hearing with a clear strategy: attack Michael Cohen's credibility.  They aggressively went after Cohen's crimes that weren't tied to the hush-money payments -- lying to Congress, cheating on his taxes -- to paint him as an uncredible witness whose accusations were meaningless. The GOP side also gave its two most vocal attack dogs -- ranking member Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina -- ample time to press Cohen, with most Republicans deferring their final minute to one of the two House Freedom Caucus leaders.  But they largely avoided trying to defend Trump against Cohen's allegations. Instead, they worked to muddy the waters by raising questions about Cohen's character, even accusing him of lying during his testimony on Wednesday. And Republicans put Cohen on the defensive about whether he wanted to work at the White House, after he insisted in his testimony that he did not despite federal prosecutors stating in court filings Cohen had told friends he expected a prominent position. After the hearing, Meadows said there were six inconsistencies that they planned to probe.  Cohen was critical of Trump, to a point Cohen spent most of the day criticizing his former boss. But he also ruled out some of the more salacious accusations that have been leveled against Trump. Cohen was asked about multiple rumored tapes of Trump, including a claim of alleged \"catch-and-kill\" footage of Trump striking his wife, Melania Trump. \"I have no reason to believe that tape exists,\" Cohen said. \"I don't believe Mr. Trump ever struck Mrs. Trump, ever.\" Later, Cohen was asked if there are any tapes that could be the subject of \"extortion or blackmail\" -- a reference to long rumored Russian kompromat. \"I've heard about these tapes for a long time, I've had many people contact me over the years -- I have no reason to believe that that tape exists,\" Cohen said. And Cohen also shot down the notion of a \"love child.\" \"There is not, to the best of my knowledge.\" More significantly, Cohen said he did not believe that Trump had directed Stone to reach out to WikiLeaks. While Cohen accused Trump of learning from Stone about a WikiLeaks' email dump, he said Stone was \"freelancing.\"  Testimony contradicts Stone and Trump Jr.   Cohen's testimony is at odds with statements from several other key witnesses, including Stone and Trump Jr. It's not clear whether Cohen opened anyone up to legal scrutiny, but he did raise questions about what key Trump officials have previously testified. Trump Jr., for instance, has denied telling his father ahead of time about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. Cohen said he thought he heard such a conversation occur -- though he didn't have proof. \"Don Jr. came into the room and walked behind his father's desk -- which in itself was unusual,\" Cohen said. \"I recalled Don Jr. leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying: 'The meeting is all set.' I remember Mr. Trump saying, 'OK good ... let me know.'\" But Cohen raised other potential issues for Trump's eldest son. He said that he briefed Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump 10 times about the Trump Tower Moscow project. Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2017 that he knew \"very little\" about the project. \"I was peripherally aware of it, but most of my knowledge has been gained since,\" Trump Jr. testified. Cohen's testimony about Stone and WikiLeaks is also at odds with Stone's previous testimony that he didn't speak to Assange, though like Cohen, Stone has also been charged with lying to Congress. (Stone has pleaded not guilty.) WikiLeaks tweeted on Wednesday that Assange \"has never had a telephone call with Roger Stone.\" This is a White House problem, not just a campaign one  Cohen is known for his work in the Trump Organization, and he never worked in the White House. But his testimony makes clear that Trump's problems with Cohen's allegations stretch directly into the Oval Office. While the two hush-money payments occurred before Trump was elected President, Trump was paying back Cohen while he was in the White House, as Cohen testified. And Trump spoke to Cohen last year about directing the public fallout from the payments, directing him to lie about Trump's knowledge of the payments, Cohen said. In addition, Cohen said that he went over his false testimony with Trump's lawyers in the White House -- and spoke to Trump ahead of his testimony. Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, asked Cohen about an email that Trump had requested a meeting with Cohen and the President's former attorney Jay Sekulow, where he said he discussed his upcoming testimony. Cohen said his statement was edited by Trump's attorneys. And he claimed the President was suggesting he lie to Congress, even if he didn't say it directly.  Instead, Cohen said that Trump did not \"directly\" tell him to lie to Congress, but that Trump would tell him personally and the public that he had \"no business\" with Russia, even as he was negotiating the Moscow project. \"In his way, he was telling me to lie,\" Cohen said. In a statement, Sekulow responded that Cohen's testimony about editing the Trump Tower Moscow testimony was \"completely false.\"","91":" (CNN)The former owner of a Florida massage parlor on Wednesday denied any wrongdoing after allegations she had sold access to President Donald Trump to Chinese clients.  In an interview with NBC, Cindy Yang -- the founder and former owner of a chain of Florida massage parlors that was the target of a months-long police sting operation investigating a prostitution and sex trafficking ring -- denied she has done \"anything wrong\" and said she believes people take issue with her being a \"Chinese Republican.\"  Yang sold her interest in the company years ago and was not affiliated with the chain when it was busted by police last month. \"I don't do anything wrong,\" Yang said. Four leading Democrats have called on the FBI to conduct criminal and counterintelligence probes into allegations of foreign lobbying, human trafficking and potential campaign finance violations against Yang. The call for the probe followed a report by the Miami Herald that Yang arranged for a large group of Chinese businesspeople to attend a New York City fundraiser for Trump in 2017 as her guests.  Democrats argue that Yang's alleged actions raise \"serious counterintelligence concerns\" in a letter addressed to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Secret Service Director Randolph Alles.  Foreign nationals may not donate to US political campaigns, but they are legally allowed to attend fundraisers if their tickets are paid for by US citizens or permanent residents.  The Democrats' letter to the FBI says Yang's website offered clients \"the opportunity to interact with the President\" and other political leaders. The letter points to public records that say Yang has been a frequent guest of Trump's, including at his Mar-a-Lago estate. \"Although Ms. Yang's activities may only be those of an unscrupulous actor allegedly selling access to politicians for profit, her activities also could permit adversary governments or their agents access to these same politicians to acquire potential material for blackmail or other even more nefarious purposes,\"\u00a0the lawmakers wrote.  The letter was signed by Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York.  Yang is connected to the recent high-profile prostitution case involving New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Last month, Kraft was charged with soliciting prostitution at the Florida massage parlor that Yang founded. Kraft has pleaded not guilty. ","92":"David A.

Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Under tradition, though not law, the president of the United States is supposed to have the final say. On Wednesday, Donald Trump is expected to name as his nominee David Malpass, current undersecretary for international affairs at the Treasury Department and a confirmed Trump acolyte who has spent his two years in office doing his best to diminish the World Bank in a host of ways \u2014 effectively,  driving from office prematurely the man Barack Obama named to this post, according to the Nikkei Asian Review.   If the World Bank's board allows Malpass to lead the organization, which channels lending to developing countries and sets goals in governance and reform, it could change the bank's global role substantially \u2014 and not for the better.  Putting Malpass in this job, and ignoring the value of a strong, independent World Bank \u2014 failing to choose wisely \u2014 could prove very damaging. Yet again, the President will be putting first what he sees as America's interests and not those of the vast stretches of the world that depend so heavily on the actions of the World Bank and its leader. What is rapidly assuming the dimensions of a crisis erupted three weeks ago when the incumbent, Jim Yong Kim, a Korean-born American and former president of Dartmouth College, twice appointed by President Obama, unexpectedly resigned halfway through his second five-year term.  Until a new president is chosen, the bank's number two, Kristalina Georgieva, a Bulgarian and former senior European Union official, will run the show.  Kim's resignation was a warning sign. By his actions, Kim seemed to be trapped between the Trump administration's priorities in cutting costs and the expenses of fulfilling the bank's global mission.  And then there was the overhang of the American withdrawal entirely from such international organizations as UNESCO and the United Nations Human Rights Council.  Though it seems unlikely Trump would pull out of either the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund, mirror organizations that serve the developing and developed worlds, cuts in funding or a scaled-back mission for either body could prove catastrophic. Which now leaves us with the critical question of the choice of Kim's successor. In recent days, Trump had reportedly been auditioning a group of wannabe presidents before settling on Malpass. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and even Trump's own daughter, Ivanka, were said to have played key roles in the selection process. At one point, according to a report from the Financial Times, Ivanka was  being considered for the job herself. The White House said those reports were false.  Malpass, a conservative critic of the global organizations, could put Trump one step closer to setting the global development agenda himself.  Malpass has played an important role in seeking to redirect the mission and focus of the bank's operations. Believing that such global organizations have \"grown larger and more intrusive,\" he has seen \"the challenge of refocusing them [becoming] urgent and more difficult.\"  While a large amount of the bank's lending has flowed to India and China, Malpass has been pressing Trump's agenda of slashing World Bank loans to China, which now total more than $60 billion. This put Kim in a particularly difficult position, as China has been a trusted and reliable borrower and is the third largest bank shareholder.  With Malpass at the helm, resistance to Chinese borrowing from the bank would likely increase. Still, there are other candidates. In April, the bank's board will designate three candidates, then select a winner. The most broadly accepted, with the apparent endorsement of the developing world, is former Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. I first met Okonjo-Iweala nearly 20 years ago as she was en route back to her native Nigeria for her first term as finance minister under President Olusegun Obasanjo. She saw herself as an unreconstructed reformer and described to me her mission of reducing dramatically her nation's crushing international debt burden.  Her resume was impeccable: a magna cum laude graduate in economics from Harvard College, a Ph.D. in development from MIT. She spent 25 years at the World Bank, rising through the ranks to a top post of managing director. Trump could do no better than to step aside and cede the post to Okonjo-Iweala.  Many across Africa still remember how Donald Trump had allegedly referred to their nations as \"shithole countries.\" The President has denied he made the comment.  His allowing the best-qualified candidate to be elected would go a long way toward reversing the image conveyed late last year by national security adviser John Bolton's avowedly America First policy on Africa.  And this would free the World Bank to act responsibly on all its activities, while demonstrating to China that the United States can be a willing partner and not merely an adversary as trade talks head into their most crucial stages. What might someone not tethered to the blinkered American development agenda be able to accomplish?  First, there's climate change. Kim made major strides, refusing to finance most oil and gas projects this year, doubling investments to $200 billion in low-carbon projects \u2014 directly contrary to the policies of the Trump administration. But the most important accomplishment of any Kim successor would be returning the World Bank to a sense of itself as a central player in global development. Kim stepped down at least partly out of his belief that in the private sector, he \"will be able to make the largest impact on major global issues.\" In any case, it is now up to the voting directors of the World Bank to break with precedent (there has never been a non-American president) and assert its vision of the future by selecting a leader who is willing and able to fight for everything the bank can and should represent, especially to the least advantaged and those in greatest need of its resources. In the short run, standing up to Trump could be painful and expensive. But it is one area where the bank could deny Trump a legacy that will last long past his term as President.","93":" (CNN)President Donald Trump placed more pressure on the stalled trade talks with the European Union Wednesday, threatening tariffs on European automobiles if no deal is reached. \"The European Union has been very tough on the United States for many years,\" Trump told reporters on Wednesday, saying the auto tariffs were under review. \"We're looking at something to combat it.\" Trump received a report from the Commerce Department last month with the findings of an investigation into whether imports of automobiles and auto parts could qualify for tariffs as a national security threat under an obscure Cold-War era statute. The report and its recommendations have not been made public; Trump has until the middle of May to choose a course of action. On Wednesday, Trump said his decision would hinge on how talks with the EU proceed. He has long threatened to impose hefty tariffs on European autos and auto parts. Tensions heightened last year after Trump slapped tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, leading the EU to retaliate with tariffs on American products. The President reached a ceasefire with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last July, when the two agreed to pursue a bilateral trade deal.  Although they initially agreed to a narrow framework for a deal that would affect primarily non-auto industrial goods, the United States and the EU are now worlds apart on what should be included in the deal. Trump's administration, under pressure from Congress and the American agriculture industry, now wants to ink a comprehensive deal that would open up European markets to agricultural products, which the Europeans say would be a dealbreaker. \"The United States can't have a trade agreement with Europe that doesn't deal with agriculture, and their view is that they can't have one that does,\" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told the Senate Finance Committee last week. Agriculture has long been one of the most contentious aspects of the trade relationship -- it was the Obama administration's primary stumbling block during drawn-out negotiations for the uncompleted Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the EU. Whereas the Obama administration's efforts seemed to hit a wall in the third year of talks, the Trump administration has reached a stalemate before negotiations have even begun in earnest.  \"Tariffs create tensions that don't exist in normal trade negotiations,\" observed conservative one trade lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the matter publicly. \"With the tariffs in play, it's a bit of a hostage situation.\" While Trump's strategy of trade restrictions and bluster may have brought the Europeans to the table in the first place, it hasn't yet been able to dismantle the deeply entrenched political dynamics that have stumped negotiators in years past. \"The EU is not going to be threatened to change food rules. That is the opposite of which way the debate's going in Europe and the UK generally on food rules,\" said David Henig, who negotiated TTIP for the United Kingdom. American negotiators want to see trade barriers for agricultural products lifted, but EU member states are standing firm on food safety standards and restrictions on genetically modified foods. France is especially outspoken about avoiding agriculture in the bilateral trade talks. \"The Commission is really frustrating to deal with,\" said Henig, now the director of the UK Trade Policy Project at the European Centre for International Political Economy, in a phone interview with CNN. \"The Commission has found very clever ways not to do what you want them to do. So has USTR, actually. They're both very formidable when you get down to them. They're probably more similar than they wish to admit.\" But different administrations have different styles. Henig said the United States was far from a nice negotiating partner five years ago, but the White House \"was a little bit more targeted and a little bit more sensitive to what was likely to be achievable than it is now.\" Republicans in Congress have pushed back on the potential auto tariffs, with some key lawmakers --  such as Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, of Iowa -- planning to advance bipartisan legislation to roll back Trump's power to impose such restrictions unilaterally. They haven't managed to convince the President to stand down. About a dozen Republican senators who attended a nearly two-hour trade meeting with Trump and some of his top economic advisers last Wednesday were tight-lipped about what took place after the conversation. But one Republican senator who went to the meeting told CNN that Trump \"absolutely\" pushed back on the senators' aversion to auto tariffs and emphasized \"his willingness to use them and the concessions he thought he was getting by having that on the table.\" Senate Republican Whip John Thune, of South Dakota, confirmed Trump wasn't deterred by the senators' remarks. \"They want to be able to have all the tools in their toolbox to get the attention of some of these countries we're trying to deal with,\" Thune said of the White House's position. \"I hope that doesn't become necessary, but I guess based on what I heard today, I don't think I would rule anything out.\"","94":" (CNN)Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar said not doing more to address prescription drug prices in the Affordable Care Act was a \"missed opportunity\" by former President Barack Obama. Klobuchar, in an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow that aired Friday morning, laid out policy positions on regulating large tech companies, addressing prescription drug prices and tackling the opioid epidemic. In all of her answers, however, Klobuchar said either the former Democratic president or some of her colleagues in Congress did not grasp the issues early on. Klobuchar, one of more than a dozen Democrats running for president in 2020, has made prescription drug prices a paramount issue in both her Senate work and in her campaign. And her comments about Obama follow an earlier statement in which the Minnesota Democrat said high drug prices have been neglected \"under any administration\" in the last two decades. \"I see it as a missed opportunity, but now we must move forward,\" she said. \"And that's why I think both parties have been guilty of not bringing these up, but there's one party in charge right now and that's the Republican Party.\" Klobuchar voted for the Affordable Care Act, Obama's sweeping healthcare law that passed the Senate in 2009, but -- like others in the Democratic caucus -- now believes that changes could be made to update the law. Prescription drug prices were not nearly the spotlight issue that they are now, but even Democrats at the time that the law was passed acknowledged more could have been done in the law to address health care issues. \"I would have liked to see this be part of the Affordable Care Act.  But it wasn't, in part, because they were working with the pharmaceutical companies on the premiums issue. They were working with them on getting support for the Affordable Care Act because they knew that pharma could stop that bill in its tracks,\" she said. Obama has met with a series of 2020 candidates, including Klobuchar, and made defending his health care law a central theme of his post-presidency political work.  Klobuchar announced her 2020 run with a February speech in Minneapolis and has since focused considerable attention on making key policy areas she has pushed in the Senate -- namely high prescription drug prices, fighting the opioid epidemic and regulation large technology companies -- part of her 2020 message. \"I think there are members of Congress that had their eyes closed because they don't want to deal with this,\" Klobuchar told CNN about regulating technology companies. Ahead of launching her 2020 bid, Klobuchar introduced a bill in February to modernize anti-trust enforcement rules, saying that these rules affect \"more than just price and output -- it's part of our everyday lives, from the price of groceries at the market to the cost of prescription drugs.\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren went further earlier this month when she suggested breaking up companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. \"Today's big tech companies have too much power -- too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said. \"That's why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition.\" Klobuchar said she agreed with Warren. \"Some of this is worth looking at, in terms of she's getting at the fact that there are conflicts, when they own companies that are being actually featured on their own platforms,\" the Minnesota Democrat said. But she also attempted to take a more measured approach, telling CNN that she would only support breaking up companies if it is warranted. \"How I would approach it is a little different,\" Klobuchar said. \"If, in fact, the law shows that they should be broken up and it may well do that,\" she added. \"One, you try to change the laws so they're better suited for what we're dealing with, for things like a company being the only source for all of the companies underneath it.\" On opioids, Klobuchar said that when she worked with Democrat Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Republicans Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire to \"put this bill forward for a blueprint\" on tackling the opioid crisis \"other senators (were) kind of patting us on the head saying, 'Oh yeah.'\" The opioid crisis is one area that Klobuchar, who proudly touts her work with other Republicans, has found success with President Donald Trump. To date, the Republican president has signed three bills dealing with opioids that Klobuchar has worked on. \"I think they understand now,\" Klobuchar said when asked if Congress understands the crisis. Klobuchar named Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa as one of the senators with whom she can work on this issue. \"Chuck Grassley's a bit of a maverick,\" Klobuchar said with a laugh, giving him a nickname that harkened back to the late Sen. John McCain. \"He's now chair of the Finance Committee, so he should be in a place to bring these bills up.\"","95":"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen said under oath Wednesday that he had never traveled to Prague to collude with Russian officials in 2016, denying a key claim of the infamous \"dossier\" that alleged a conspiracy between Trump and the Kremlin. His comments during a marathon House Oversight Committee hearing were his first public denial under oath, meaning he could be prosecuted for perjury if he was not telling the truth. \"I've never been to Prague. ... I've never been to the Czech Republic,\" Cohen told lawmakers.  Cohen has denied the allegation from the very beginning. CNN did not publish the unverified intelligence memos compiled by a retired British spy but was first to report in January 2017 that the documents were being circulated among US intelligence agencies.  The dossier said Cohen had traveled to Prague during summer 2016 and struck a corrupt bargain with Russians, agreeing to coordinate with their efforts to help Trump win the election.  And Trump has always insisted that there was \"no collusion whatsoever\" between his campaign and the Kremlin. At Wednesday's hearing, Cohen said he didn't know about \"direct evidence\" of collusion but \"I have my suspicions,\" and he accused Trump of lying about topics related to Russian election interference.  In private testimony to congressional committees in 2017, Cohen denied that he had gone to Prague. But in that same testimony, he lied to lawmakers about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. He pleaded guilty last year to lying to Congress and to eight unrelated charges of financial fraud and campaign finance violations. His three-year prison term begins in May.  Rumors about Cohen's supposed Prague trip have flourished among Trump's opponents and liberal-leaning Twitter personalities who follow the Russia investigation. The chatter flared up last year when a reputable news service reported that special counsel Robert Mueller had evidence linking Cohen to Prague. That report wasn't corroborated by CNN or any other outlets.  Trump and Cohen are now bitter enemies. Trump has called his former lawyer a \"rat\" for helping federal investigators, and Cohen said Wednesday that Trump is a racist \"conman\" who broke the law. But back in 2017 when the allegations came out, Trump rushed to Cohen's defense.  \"Michael Cohen is a very talented lawyer, he's a good lawyer in my firm,\" Trump said after the dossier was published, adding that he had reviewed Cohen's passport and didn't see evidence of any Prague trip. \"He wasn't out of the country. ... It turned out to be a different Michael Cohen. ... It's a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohen.\" In addition to the speculation about Prague, some other key dossier claims remain unproven after two years of searching, including salacious allegations about Trump's visit to Moscow in 2013.  But many of the allegations that form the bulk of the intelligence memos have held up over time or have proved to be at least partially true. This includes claims that Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw a vast operation to interfere in the US election and that there were extensive contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials during the campaign. ","96":"Washington (CNN)On the eve of a deadline to avoid a second partial government shutdown, no one -- not congressional leaders, President Donald Trump's allies on Capitol Hill nor his own staff -- is ready to say that he is willing to sign a compromise immigration bill. But his labored efforts to spin a win out of a nearly two-month confrontation with Democrats -- that brought his border wall no closer -- leave little doubt about the victors from the first big showdown in the new era of divided government. Two sources told CNN's Dana Bash on Wednesday that the President will sign the bill, reflecting the fact that it is likely the best he can get out of Congress and the political perils of triggering another shutdown. \"We're going to look at the legislation when it comes, and I'll make a determination then,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. Votes are expected in the House and the Senate as early as Thursday evening in order to get the legislation to the President's desk -- and ensure relief for 800,000 federal workers living in fear of another shutdown. Yet Trump, who has a flair for cliffhangers and believes behaving unpredictably keeps everyone else off balance, has yet to give full public assurance he will sign the measure, which falls well short of his demand for $5.7 billion in border wall funding. That may be why Democrats apparently chose not to take a victory lap after depriving Trump of funding for his top campaign promise and Republicans gingerly expressed hopes the President would sign the legislation. Everyone is right to be cautious since the President has a record of changing his mind about apparently squared away congressional deals. On the most notorious occasion, he torpedoed a stopgap funding bill in December that lacked wall funding but would have staved off a shutdown that turned into the longest in US history. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed optimism Wednesday when CNN's Manu Raju asked her whether she believes Trump will sign. \"I think he will,\" she said. But no one thinks Trump will just give up the fight even if he signs a bill that includes nearly $1.4 billion for border barriers but no money for the wall he once said Mexico would finance. Trump has hinted that if he signs the measure, he will take executive action and possibly even declare a national emergency to reprogram money from other government accounts -- likely triggering a constitutional showdown and legal challenges over the extent of presidential powers. \"I don't want to see a shutdown. A shutdown would be a terrible thing,\" Trump said. \"We have options that most people don't really understand.\" No one will say But whether through prudence, political strategy or recognition of the President's sometimes capricious political temperament, his subordinates were unwilling to state definitively that Trump will sign the measure. Taking their lead from the boss, White House director of strategic communications Mercedes Schlapp and Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, dodged on Wednesday when asked whether Trump would enshrine the bill into law. \"It's hard to say definitively whether or not the President's going to sign it until we know everything that's in it,\" Sanders said. Schlapp told CNN: \"We are right now at a point where we are going to be reviewing the details and see if the President will move forward and sign it.\" One of the potential issues for supporters of the bill is that Trump is highly susceptible to news coverage of his presidency, especially on immigration, the issue that did most to enable his hostile takeover of the GOP. But even the President's conservative media boosters, whose criticism in December was seen as crucial to him backing out of the previous deal, appear to be offering him political cover as long as he takes executive action. \"I wouldn't be a bit surprised if that's what they're thinking, to declare a national emergency or at least threaten to as part of signing this thing, because the point is gonna be made that this isn't enough,\" talk radio titan Rush Limbaugh told his listeners on Wednesday. Another conservative media superstar with Trump's ear, Sean Hannity, said Trump would be within his rights to reject the bill but that a better solution may be to sign it, use the $1.4 billion as a \"down payment\" on the wall, then tap other government accounts for construction. \"This important third step needs to happen simultaneously,\" Hannity said Tuesday, using his Fox News show in an extraordinary manner, by drawing out a political play for a sitting commander in chief. \"That would be the President would need to declare a national emergency. This is the time; that is a necessity,\" Hannity said. Fights remain A political and legal fight over the declaration of a state of emergency might not lead to immediate construction on a wall. But it would offer a rallying issue for Trump supporters and allow the President to claim he will not back down. Expectations that Trump will sign the compromise reflect the unlikelihood of him making any further progress toward funding the wall with Democrats in control of the House. \"This agreement is the last train leaving the station away from another dreaded government shutdown,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said on Tuesday. Republican Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, who was on the committee that came up with the compromise bill, said she and colleagues on Capitol Hill had no assurances from the White House that the President would sign on. But she told CNN's Kate Bolduan: \"I am certainly hoping he will sign the bill after it has passed.\" Perhaps seeking to stamp out assessments that he had lost the shutdown fight -- over a wall that polls show most Americans oppose and don't think was worth shuttering the federal government over -- Trump turned into his own cheerleader. \"The wall is very, very on its way. It's happening as we speak. We're building, as we speak, in the most desperately needed areas,\" Trump told a conference of sheriffs in Washington. \"It's a big wall. It's a strong wall. It's a wall the people aren't going through very easy. You're going to have to be in extremely good shape to get over this one. They would be able to climb Mount Everest a lot easier, I think,\" he added. While repair work on existing barriers authorized by Congress has been taking place, there is no sign that construction on the kind of wall that Trump was boasting about is under way. The President also sought to expand his argument, first expressed at a campaign rally on Monday night in Texas, that the shutdown that ended when he folded his cards last month after 35 days had been a success for him. \"I think a point was made with the last shutdown; people realized how bad the border is, how unsafe the border is. And I think a lot of good points were made,\" Trump said.","97":" (CNN)Stewart Rahr is a pharmaceutical billionaire, self-described \"king of all fun\" and, as President Donald Trump told a magazine, a real character. Rahr, a fixture on gossip sites, was \"the fake bidder\" who plunked down $60,000 in 2013 for a portrait of his friend Trump, according to an article clipping provided Wednesday by former Trump attorney Michael Cohen. \"The objective was to ensure that his portrait, which was going to be auctioned last, would go for the highest price of any portrait that afternoon,\" Cohen said in his opening statement Wednesday to the House Oversight Committee. He also described the bidder as a straw buyer, who makes a purchase on behalf of another person. The bidder was reimbursed by the charity Trump Foundation, Cohen told the House Oversight Committee. CNN made several calls and emails to Rahr, but did not receive a response. On one attempt, a man who answered the phone said he could get Rahr on the line but hung up once he found out it was CNN calling. Rahr declined to comment when the Washington Post reported on Trump's charitable giving in 2016. CNN also reached out to the Trump Organization but has not yet received a response. In 2015, Dan's Papers, a lifestyle publication in the posh Hamptons on Long Island, reported that the portrait's artist, William Quigley, had heard about Trump's interest in the painting and was told to raise the starting bid. Trump asked his pal Rahr to bid on his behalf at the 2013 auction, according to Dan's Papers.  \"Mr. Trump directed the Trump Foundation, which is supposed to be a charitable organization, to repay the fake bidder, despite keeping the art for himself,\" Cohen testified. The Trump Foundation dissolved in late 2018 amid a New York state lawsuit that claimed it violated campaign-finance laws and abused its tax-exempt status. One of Cohen's exhibits includes a news article saying that Rahr, a prominent art collector, made the purchase. The item is circled and labeled \"Michael C.\" Cohen testified that Trump's handwriting was on a copy of a New York Daily News article about the sale. Trump tweeted about the winning bid a few days later, but didn't mention having any role in it.  \"Just found out that at a charity auction of celebrity portraits in E. Hampton, my portrait by artist William Quigley topped list at $60K,\" Trump tweeted. According to a 2013 Forbes profile, Rahr, now in his early 70s, built his fortune through his family business Kinray, a drug distribution company. In 2010, he sold Kinray to Cardinal Health for $1.3 billion.  Page Six has frequently written about Rahr's Gatsby-esque, lavish spending and wild antics. Rahr, who refers to himself in the third person as \"Rah Rah,\" was banned from the famed sushi restaurant Nobu in 2012 for cursing out the manager, according to the New York Post. His gun license was also suspended for a period of time after a heated exchange with an elevator operator that same year, The New York Times reported.  Rahr would send massive email blasts containing updates on his life to a list of celebrities, journalists, politicians and other influential figures, Forbes reported. The messages were often signed \"Stewie Rah Rah Number One King of All Fun.\" And much like another New York billionaire, he's often seen posing for photos with celebrities. \"He's different than other people,\" Trump told the magazine. \"He's a character, and he's fun to be with.\" So where is the portrait now? It's hanging in one of the President's country clubs, Cohen said. Quigley told Dan's Papers that he had met with Trump in person to collect the check, \"He was nothing but a gentleman.\"","98":" (CNN)House Republicans on Thursday signaled how they plan to fight back attempts by Democrats to obtain President Donald Trump's personal tax returns, describing the effort in a hearing as a \"waste of time\" and \"weaponizing\" the law to target a political foe. Throughout a more than two-hour hearing on Capitol Hill, GOP lawmakers pressed tax historians and experts over whether a House tax-writing committee has the legal authority to request such confidential financial documents from the Treasury secretary, describing it as a clear violation of privacy of any individual American that would set a \"dangerous precedent.\" \"Where does it end? What about the tax returns of the speaker? Political donors? There is no end in sight,\" said Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means subcommittee panel, at the hearing. \"Every single American has the right to privacy.\" It was an argument that Republican lawmakers returned to repeatedly in reviewing a provision in the Democrats' sweeping ethics reform legislation -- H.R. 1\u2014that requires future presidential candidates and the President to release 10 years of tax returns. Thursday's hearing was a step aimed at helping Democrats bolster their case for why the American people need to see Trump's tax returns, arguing given his array of business dealings, including overseas, should be revealed to the public.  But it soon became the first real skirmish between Trump's defenders in Congress and newly empowered Democrats since the House changed hands last month. \"I welcome this time of examination,\" said Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and chairman of the panel, channeling Richard Nixon. \"People have got to know if their President is a crook.\" Illinois Republican Rep. Darin LaHood blasted the effort by Democrats as a \"waste of time and energy and resources\" of the committee, arguing such a step was unprecedented especially while a sitting president was undergoing an independent investigation by the special counsel's office.  \"I look at the legitimate purpose and the legal purpose and I don't see it,\" said LaHood. \"I go back to what my colleagues said about weaponizing the tax code and we should all be concerned about that.\" Since the early 1970s, most presidents have chosen to release their tax returns to the public for the years they serve in office and only while they hold office, which they are not required to do under the law. The practice began with Jimmy Carter, who ran and took office in the aftermath of President Richard Nixon's tax scandal and Watergate. That tradition broke in 2016, when Donald Trump became the first major candidate to refuse, citing an ongoing audit. Joe Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project, expressed concern that such a refusal could break a historical record that has lasted over four decades. \"I am concerned that it may be completely broken,\" said Thorndike, adding \"Then we can't really rely on a tradition to get the job done.\" Richard Neal, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has said he plans to request Trump's returns using IRS code 6103, a provision that Democrats say allows the chairman of the House Ways and Means committee to request Trump's tax returns, a move separate from the legislative debate on requiring future commanders in chief to release their records. The law, which Democrats can invoke without Republican approval, states that the chairmen of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means committee each have the power to request taxpayer information and states that \"the secretary shall furnish such committee with any return or return information specified in such request.\" The decision of how to handle a request for Trump's returns will fall to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, one of the President's closest confidants and earliest backers. A Treasury spokesperson said Mnuchin would review any request for the President's tax returns with his general counsel to determine if they are required under law. Some of the witnesses -- a crew of tax and ethics experts -- have urged Congress to demand them, arguing that it would provide answers to whether the President, who has maintained ownership of his business, is benefiting from public office. \"I don't see any wiggle room for the Treasury secretary to refuse the request,\" said George Yin, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law and former chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation, adding it would be \"unprecedented\" for the secretary to refuse. One looming question is whether the committee has the legal authority to disclose the President's tax returns upon receipt -- a topic Yin and Ken Kies, the managing director of the Federal Policy Group sparred over throughout the hearing, with each taking a contradictory view. Trump's lawyers have already threatened a court fight over the release of the returns, and Democrats on Capitol Hill anticipate that Treasury will take its time in reviewing any request. In January, Neal told CNN that he is \"judiciously\" pursuing Trump's tax returns. \"I think the idea here is to avoid the emotion of the moment and make sure that the product stands up under critical analysis,\" he said. \"And it will.\" Republicans have dismissed the Democratic effort as a partisan witch hunt. \"I would expect the President to use every legal means he can to keep that from happening. I don't know what those legal means are, I just would expect him to use every legal means,\" said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican. \"I thought we learned a lesson about the politicization of the IRS when Nixon was President and that is why 6103 was passed, so what are the Democrats doing trying to use the IRS as a political tool? It's just as wrong (as) if Nixon were doing it.\" On Wednesday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he views the House Ways and Means Committee's ability to seek Trump's tax returns as \"political.\" \"I think Ways and Means should focus their time making sure of how strong this economy is today, of how we can make it stronger,\" said McCarthy, a California Republican. \"I think that's the focus of the American people would like to see going forward, and that's the focus we'd have as well.\"","99":" (CNN)America's third largest city chooses its next mayor on Tuesday, with a field of more than a dozen candidates running to replace two-term Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who is retiring. The race has largely flown under the national radar until recently, when Bill Daley, the former Commerce secretary and chief of staff to Barack Obama (not to mention the son and brother of past Chicago mayors) began to surge in the polls. Intrigued by the idea of another Daley leading Chicago --- Richard J. Daley was mayor from 1955-1976 and his son, Richard M. Daley, was mayor from 1989-2011 -- I reached out to the longtime Chicago Tribune political reporter Rick Pearson for more perspective on the race. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: Let's start with why the mayor's office is open: Why is Rahm leaving? Was he in danger of losing? Pearson: Rahm Emanuel is a smart politician, and he knew his time had come. Deep anger still exists in the African-American community over the 2014 killing of Laquan McDonald, a black teen, by white police officer Jason Van Dyke. Video of the shooting wasn't released by the city until after Emanuel's 2015 re-election. Van Dyke was subsequently tried and convicted of second-degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm. The African-American community is a key voting demographic, and Emanuel's association with President Barack Obama, serving as his first chief of staff, helped him win black votes. No such goodwill exists this time. Additionally, the city faces some crushing financial hurdles, namely with a sizable pension debt. Emanuel has been forced to raise a variety of taxes to cope. Tax fatigue has set in among its residents. I would never say Emanuel couldn't win. But even with his vast array of political smarts, the odds were heavily against him. Cillizza: At the start of the race, what was the conventional wisdom about who the frontrunners were? Pearson: Emanuel announced in September that he wouldn't seek a third term. But a contest was already developing before that. After Emanuel's announcement, a scramble began that led to the current 14 candidates in the race. At that point, the early favorites included Toni Preckwinkle, a former alderman and the current Cook County Board president who also would become Cook County Democratic chair. Susana Mendoza was running for re-election last November as state comptroller, a race she ultimately won, but let it be known she'd be a mayoral candidate. The contest among two experienced women seemed an early likely scenario, though political races rarely end up where they began. CIllizza: This is a city that has been ruled by Daleys for the better part of the last seven decades. When did Bill Daley emerge as a candidate? And is his last name the key to his rise? Pearson: A few months ago, Bill Daley was viewed as an unlikely choice and would have to fight perceived Daley fatigue as the son and brother of two mayors.  But Daley became the best-funded candidate in the race, with more than $8.5 million, and blanketed the TV airwaves. He pointed out he had worked as Bill Clinton's Commerce secretary and Obama's chief of staff while also trying to make the case he was his own man, not responsible for the failures of his brother or the past, and that he should not be viewed as a political insider but an outsider. Daley's name is certainly part of his rise. Older voters still view the Daleys as having run a stable city over the decades and they are a dedicated voting demographic. At the same time, the city's business community has gravitated in part to Daley, helping finance his campaign. Plus, there's still a Daley political apparatus around for Election Day. But Daley has talked about curbing public employee pensions -- something that actually would likely be found unconstitutional in Illinois. That has unions attacking him, and scattered to other candidates like Preckwinkle and Mendoza. Cillizza: It's a big field. What happens if no one gets a majority? Pearson: In the mid-1990s, when Republicans controlled the Illinois legislature and the governor's office, the state made Chicago municipal election a non-partisan election in hopes a Republican would have a chance -- something that never materialized. Along with the change, it instituted a run-off provision. If no one gets 50% plus one vote today -- something that is highly unlikely in this field -- the top two vote-getters are pitted in a runoff election on April 2. The large field of candidates has the electorate split among [the 14 candidates] in early polling. There's no runaway leader here and anything can happen. Remember as well that we're coming off a brutal and expensive campaign for governor last November that filled TVs with ads for more than a year. There may well be some voter fatigue and without significant signs of enthusiasm the turnout may mirror the 34% of four years ago. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \"If Bill Daley wins the Chicago mayor's race, the message we should draw from that victory is __________.\" Now, explain. Pearson: I would say again \"stability.\"  For some voters, Daley is like a comfort food. The family is a known quantity. They know what they're getting. It may be bland, it may not always be served up with great flavor, but they know what will be on the food tray when it gets passed out.","100":" (CNN)Federal prosecutors in New York have requested interviews in recent weeks with executives at the Trump Organization, according to people familiar with the matter, signaling a growing potential threat to President Donald Trump and those in his orbit from criminal investigations by the Manhattan US Attorney's office. Trump and his legal team have long harbored concerns that investigations by New York federal prosecutors -- which could last throughout his presidency -- may ultimately pose more danger to him, his family and his allies than the inquiry by special counsel Robert Mueller, according to people close to Trump. Prosecutors' recent interest in executives at Trump's family company may intensify those fears. The specific inquiry or topics of interest by prosecutors in any interviews with Trump Organization executives wasn't immediately clear. The sources were not authorized to speak on the record. A spokesperson for the company didn't respond to a request for comment. New York federal prosecutors in recent months have undertaken at least two investigations into Trump-related entities. The first one, which CNN has reported stemmed from the office's case against Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, is examining possible campaign-finance violations by executives at the Trump Organization during the company's effort to reimburse Cohen for hush-money payments he made or orchestrated to silence women who claimed affairs with Trump. Trump has denied those affairs. In the Cohen probe, one Trump Organization executive, chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, was granted immunity by federal prosecutors to provide information concerning Cohen, CNN has reported. The second investigation concerns the Trump inaugural committee and possible financial abuses related to the more than $100 million in donations raised for his inauguration, CNN has reported. On Monday, prosecutors issued a sweeping subpoena to the committee, requesting documents related to virtually every donor or donation, attendee at a committee event, piece of paperwork related to the legal requirements attached to donations and even \"the possibility of\" donations made by foreign nationals. The subpoena, a copy of which was reviewed by CNN, also disclosed that prosecutors are investigating an array of potential crimes, including conspiracy against the US, false statements, mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, inaugural committee disclosure violations, and violations of laws prohibiting contributions by foreign nations and contributions in the name of another person, also known as straw donors. A spokeswoman for the committee said Monday that it would cooperate with the inquiry. Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday that Trump \"had little to no involvement in the inaugural committee.\"  While prosecutors in New York haven't charged any Trump-linked officials aside from Cohen, who pleaded guilty in August and is set to begin his prison sentence in March, they have undertaken various investigative steps in addition to the subpoena. Prosecutors have questioned at least two former Trump campaign officials, according to people familiar with the matter. One official who was questioned last summer was asked about coordination between the Trump Organization and the campaign, one of these people said. Investigators asked this official how the Trump Organization was structured and which accounts were used to pay campaign staffers and other campaign-related bills, this person said. Despite the flurry of recent activity from the Manhattan US Attorney's office, however, it's not clear that any of its ongoing inquiries will result in charges. The investigation into possible campaign-finance violations at the company appears to be in its final stages, according to one person involved in it.","101":"Washington (CNN)Ivanka Trump will be on Capitol Hill Wednesday for a series of meetings on the administration's paid family leave initiative, which appears to be her next major policy push following last week's women's economic empowerment initiative. The daughter and top adviser to the President will meet with Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy, Joni Ernst, Mike Lee and Marco Rubio to \"continue discussions on the issue,\" a White House official said. Paid family leave is part of Trump's \"American Working Families\" portfolio, which has included other initiatives such as vocational education and workforce development. \"It's encouraging to see members on both sides of the aisle putting forward paid family leave proposals. Twenty-five years after FMLA was passed we finally have bipartisan agreement on the importance of paid leave for working parents. Now we are seeking to build consensus around policy that can garner enough votes to be passed into law,\" Trump said in a statement. This is something she's been working on with members of Congress and private sector leaders behind the scenes during her two years at the White House, with some tangible progress to date, including a hearing in the Senate Finance Committee led by Cassidy last year. She spoke about her father's commitment to pro-family policies on the campaign trail, including during her remarks to the Republican National Convention in July 2016.  \"As a mother myself, of three young children, I know how hard it is to work while raising a family. And I also know that I'm far more fortunate than most. American families need relief. Policies that allow women with children to thrive should not be novelties, they should be the norm,\" she said at the time. The administration, per the official, \"strongly supports a national paid family leave program.\"  A bipartisan deal on paid family leave, however, would be a heavy lift in Congress. Democrats and Republicans are still split on how to pay for it and how broad a national paid leave policy should be. In the past four years, the number of lawmakers supportive of paid family leave has more than doubled. In the previous 115th Congress, 205 members of Congress signed onto some type of paid family leave legislation, compared to just 80 members of Congress in the 111th. Rubio, a Florida Republican, introduced legislation last year that would allow new parents to finance their paid leave by drawing from their Social Security benefits early. And Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, has sponsored the Family And Medical Insurance Leave Act (FAMILY), which would give 12 weeks of paid time off for men and women and applies more broadly to those who are taking care of a family member with a serious medical issue. Democrats reintroduced the FAMILY Act on Tuesday. Now that the Democrats hold the majority in the House, there is confidence the bill will pass there, but it's unclear how that will play in the Senate where there is a Republican majority. At a Tuesday news conference, Gillibrand was critical of the Republican version of the bill because it only supports and covers new parents, not families at various stages in life. The senator told CNN she was willing to talk with President Donald Trump about the legislation. She insisted she would be willing to meet with \"any Republican\" who wants to discuss the policy, and had already met with Ivanka Trump. ","102":"Washington (CNN)When it comes to averting another government shutdown over border security, every day that negotiations on Capitol Hill don't fall apart is a good day. That was the message to me from one lawmaker involved -- if it seems like a low bar, it is, but given the issues and politics, it's a genuinely good sign the talks are not just ongoing, but deep in the weeds, multiple people directly involved say. There is consensus that a final agreement will need increases in funding for technology, personnel, and yes, border barriers. The levels, the structures, the details -- those are what are being hashed out in proposals and counter proposals right now.  Bottom line: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have given the conferees space to reach a deal and people directly involved remain optimistic that an agreement will be reached. The bigger outstanding question from lawmakers and staff outside the conference committee: what exactly will President Donald Trump to do with any deal.  Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby  went to the White House to brief Trump on the bipartisan group's progress. Following the meeting, the Alabama Republican was visibly pleased and upbeat when he returned to the Capitol. He told CNN that he and the President did not discuss an overall figure for an emerging agreement but rather the substance of what they were discussing -- new barriers, new technology and new personnel. He indicated Trump was aware that three-pronged approach is what was being formulated by the conference committee and that he thought Trump was ready to sign an agreement like that and keep the government open. \"I am pleased,\" Shelby said. \"We had a positive meeting. The President was urging me to try to conclude these negotiations. This is the most positive meeting I've had in a long time. So we're not there yet. We're seriously negotiating.\" Timeline: Negotiators want, and believe they need, an agreement by Friday or, at the latest, on Saturday. The absolute latest the full text of any proposal can be released publicly is Monday (in order to comply with the House 72-hour rule). So the general goal from both sides is to reach an agreement on the outstanding issues by Friday night or Saturday, spend the weekend drafting the agreement, then post it on Monday. Then what: The House would vote on Wednesday, the Senate would then follow.  Note: Negotiators -- and congressional leaders -- still have not been given any indication from the White House of what the President would or would not accept. White House officials remain in touch with lawmakers, particularly Vice President Mike Pence and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, but they haven't provided any concrete guidance or proposals, people involved with the discussions say. Lawmakers are moving forward regardless.  \"It's the hope and pray strategy,\" one Republican Senator told me Wednesday.  The backstop: As is often the case, when deadlines get close, lawmakers start talking about a short-term, one- or two-week stop-gap funding bill. Democrats have floated the idea, and several Senate Republicans have said it may be necessary as a backstop while talks continue.  Notably, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told a closed-door meeting of GOP committee chairs on Wednesday he did not think a stop-gap bill was a good idea, according to one participant -- and there's real question as to whether the president would even sign one. The message was negotiators need to reach a deal -- and get it done now. The sticking points:  Border barriers -- the topline funding number, the location and the actual structure chosen for the barriers are still under discussion. Note that Democrats have clearly moved off their position of no money for border barriers. Republicans accept $5.7 billion is a non-starter. It's not a question of if there will be barriers. The key now, per multiple sources involved is narrowing the gap on number, location and type of barrier. Detention beds -- Democrats, particularly in the House, are deeply opposed to increased funding for detention facilities to house detained undocumented immigrants. Republicans consider the funding increases in this area a must. This is a significant sticking point that has flown under the radar to some degree amid the wall fight.Personnel -- Democrats proposed hiring 1,000 new customs agents, but had restrictions on increasing other personnel on the border. Republicans want a significant increase in border patrol and ICE personnel. This is not a minor issue -- a large chunk of the Democratic caucus is sharply opposed to increased personnel (the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, in a letter to conferees Wednesday, characterized it as \"Trump's deportation force\" and urged negotiators not to increase any funding.) An interesting piece of this is the spending parameters the negotiators are working under -- technically the level for the DHS measure is about $49 billion. Republicans, in past proposals, have sought to get around those caps via emergency funding to help finance the President's priorities. There's some dispute over whether that option is on the table here, according to people involved, but more broadly it's important to note that it's not like there's unlimited funds to just plunge into the bill.  Something to keep in mind: Lawmakers and aides are clearly feeling positive about where things stand, but those directly involved also are preaching caution. Run through the above list of sticking points. Those aren't minor issues. Those are serious, significant policy differences between the two sides -- differences that have proven impossible to bridge up to this point. Things are clearly close, but as one lawmaker directly involved told me Thursday morning: \"We're just getting to the hard part now.\" The momentum: The general optimism that an agreement can be reached is quite a noteworthy shift given how completely intractable this debate has appeared for months. Surveying aides and lawmakers about why, exactly, things appear to actually be functioning now, a common theme comes back to the idea that lawmakers want to prove they can actually get something done.  Members on both sides ended the shutdown so frustrated, or in the words of one senator, \"just flat-out embarrassed\" with how things had gotten to that point that there has been an impetus to show Congress can work, and reach an agreement, and pull the dysfunction back from the brink, if only by a little. Will that prevail here? Still to be determined. But don't underestimate that as a role here in getting both sides to the table -- and creating momentum that in and of itself can become self-sustaining.  Reminder: Though it's tough to remember sometimes, this package is actually more than just the funding measure for the Department of Homeland Security. If an agreement is reached, and then passed in Congress, it would also include the other six outstanding appropriations bills, at full-year levels. Not a lot of attention is being paid to that fact, but there are a lot of priorities for both sides (particularly Democrats) in those bills, particularly at the full year funding levels. And, perhaps most importantly, it would clear the decks for negotiations to begin on the looming budget caps. There is a lot of incentive, beyond the just the Homeland Security measure, to get this package across the finish line.  This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.","103":"Srinagar, India (CNN)India said there was \"incontrovertible evidence\" that Pakistan had a \"direct hand\" in a bomb attack on a convoy that killed at least 40 people in Indian-administered Kashmir. After a Cabinet Committee on Security meeting on Friday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in a statement that India would initiate \"all possible diplomatic steps\" to \"ensure the complete isolation from the international community of Pakistan, of which incontrovertible evidence is available of having a direct hand in this gruesome terrorist incident.\" Jaitley added that India would downgrade diplomatic relations by withdrawing its \"most favored nation status\" to Pakistan -- a largely symbolic title.  Thursday's attack on a convoy of Indian soldiers killed 40 and wounded five, said M. Dhinakaran, deputy inspector general of the Central Reserve Police Force. It was deadliest attack on security forces since the beginning of the insurgency in the late 1980s. The Indian government has blamed Pakistan-based terrorist organization Jaish-e-Mohammed for the attack. \"We demand that Pakistan stop supporting terrorists and terror groups operating from their territory and dismantle the infrastructure operated by terrorist outfits to launch attacks in other countries,\" India's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. On Friday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi issued a warning to terrorist groups, saying that the \"the blood of the people is boiling.\" \"I want to tell the terrorist organizations and their supporters that have made a huge mistake. They will have to pay a very heavy cost for this. I give assurance to the nation that the forces behind the attack, the culprits behind this attack -- they will definitely be punished for their actions,\" he said at an event in New Delhi. Pakistan responds Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement hours after the attack, describing it as \"a matter of grave concern.\" \"We have always condemned acts of violence anywhere in the world,\" the statement said. It continued: \"We strongly reject any insinuation by elements in the Indian media and government that seek to link the attack to Pakistan without investigations.\" Jaish-e-Mohammed, which translates to the Army of the Prophet Mohammed, is a Pakistan-based group that operates on both sides of the border of the disputed state and seeks to unite the Indian-controlled area of Kashmir with Pakistan.  The group was listed as a terrorist organization by the US State Department in 2001, but the effort to include its leader, Masood Azhar, as an \"internationally designated terrorist\" at the United Nations was vetoed by China in 2017. Azhar founded Jaish-e-Mohammed with support from Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and several other extremist organizations, according to the UN. The group has been implicated in multiple attacks in India, including the 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament in New Delhi that killed nine people, and on the Jammu and Kashmir legislative assembly building that killed at least 31 people. Thursday's attack took place in the Pulwama district -- about 15 miles (25 kilometers) from Kashmir's capital, Srinagar. The convoy of 78 vehicles, which was transporting 2,550 paramilitary soldiers, was on the national highway when it was struck by the blast, said Muneer Khan, director general of police. \"One vehicle which was part of the convoy carrying the CRPF personnel bore the brunt of the blast resulting in multiple casualties,\" a police statement said. Indian PM condemns 'dastardly attack' India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted support for soldiers in the state. \"Attack on CRPF personnel in Pulwama is despicable. I strongly condemn this dastardly attack. The sacrifices of our brave security personnel shall not go in vain. The entire nation stands shoulder to shoulder with the families of the brave martyrs. May the injured recover quickly,\" he wrote. On Friday, Modi reiterated his comments, warning Pakistan that India will not be divided.  \"If they (Pakistan) think that the kinds of things they are doing, the conspiracies that they are concocting -- that they will be successful in creating instability in India, then they should abandon that dream. They will never be able to do it.\" Modi has taken a stronger stand toward terrorism in the state since he came to power almost five years ago. In 2018, 253 terrorists were killed by Indian security forces -- more than double the number of terrorists killed in 2015, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs. Kashmir has had a tumultuous history since the India-Pakistan partition resulted in a predominantly Hindu India and a Muslim Pakistan. After India gained independence in 1947, Kashmir has been bitterly contested by both nations, resulting in three wars and numerous other skirmishes. The latest attack comes more than two years after armed militants entered an army base in the garrison town of Uri, about 63 miles (102 kilometers) from Srinagar -- killing at least 18.  Separatist violence in the region has killed more than 47,000 people since 1989, although this toll doesn't include people who have disappeared due to the conflict. Some human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations put the death toll at twice that amount.","104":" (CNN)Robert Khuzami, the deputy US attorney for the Southern District of New York who has overseen the criminal case against President Donald Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen, is set to leave his post next month, the office announced Friday. Khuzami, whose family lives in Washington, DC, has been commuting weekly from his home and is leaving for personal reasons, according to a person familiar with the matter. The office's current chief counsel, Audrey Strauss, who had a role in the Cohen investigation, is set to replace Khuzami after his exit in mid-April, and will, in part, oversee the Cohen matter going forward, this person said.  Cohen pleaded guilty and is set to report to prison for a three-year sentence in May. The Manhattan-based US attorney's office, which charged Cohen last year, has ongoing investigations into an array of Trump-related matters, including whether any executives at the Trump Organization violated campaign-finance laws in the company's effort to reimburse Cohen for payments he made to silence women who claimed affairs with Trump. He has repeatedly denied those claims. Khuzami has been overseeing the Cohen case because the Manhattan US Attorney, Geoffrey Berman, was recused in that matter after it was referred to the office by special counsel Robert Mueller. Berman, however, hasn't been rescued from the office's other Trump-related investigations. His signature appeared on a subpoena the office sent in February to the Trump inaugural committee seeking a wide range of documents. In addition to Khuzami's departure, the office announced Friday that Craig Stewart, a partner with the law firm Arnold & Porter, will join the office as chief counsel. Khuzami, who had been a partner at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis before becoming deputy US Attorney and previously ran the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission, didn't disclose his next steps.","105":"If your day doesn't start until you've gotten up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

The New York Times provided a fresh glimpse into Trump's persistent efforts to shield himself from swirling scandals with a report that the President sought to install someone he saw as an ally atop an investigation by New York prosecutors into his former lawyer Michael Cohen. Then, in an interview with CNN, former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe -- who was instrumental in opening an obstruction inquiry against Trump -- made his strongest claim yet that he was fired hours before his scheduled retirement as a result of an internal investigation rigged against him at the instigation of the President. The revelations appear to fit into a consistent pattern of attempts by Trump to influence investigations in which he may be implicated and a constant campaign of public and private pressure on the officials involved. They also beg a mysterious question yet again: Why, if the President insists there was no coordination between his 2016 campaign and Russia's election meddling plot, has he taken such pains to undermine investigations into what he has branded a huge \"hoax?\" The New York Times reported that Trump called acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker late last year to ask whether it was possible that Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, who was recused from the case, could take over anyway. Trump lashed out at the report on Wednesday, tweeting: \"The New York Times reporting is false. They are a true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!\" Even in his public remarks, the President has often left the impression that top law enforcement officers had a duty to protect him -- like a personal lawyer -- rather than to the neutral administration of justice and to the Constitution. Fired FBI Director James Comey said Trump tried to establish a mob-like relationship of patronage with him. Trump also repeatedly berated his former Attorney General Jeff Sessions over his failure to rein in the Russia probe. Trump has mounted relentless, almost daily attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry and other investigations targeting his administration. In the worst-case scenario, his incessant private, public and political efforts to influence the investigations could add up to obstruction of justice in plain sight -- and even form part of any future articles of impeachment. Asked by CNN's Brooke Baldwin whether Trump's request to Whitaker amounted to obstruction, Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor, answered: \"What else could it be?\" \"What other reason could the President have for calling Matt Whitaker right as the Cohen investigation was growing and starting to threaten him ... and asking Whitaker, 'Can we get my guy?'\" he said. Paul Rosenzweig, a senior counsel to the Whitewater investigation, told Baldwin that if confirmed, the reporting about Trump could amount to a possible abuse of power. \"It's really hard to come up with an innocent explanation for asking somebody to unrecuse from a recusal that seems wholly appropriate,\" he said. \"It is a little early to say for sure what the facts are since Mr. Whitaker has sort of denied this -- but if the facts prove out as it is, this is potentially impeachable.\" There is no evidence that Whitaker asked Berman, who was appointed by the President's former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, to take over the inquiry, a decision that led Trump to sour on Whitaker. It is not known what Whitaker might have told the President in private conversations after he was read into the Mueller investigation. He insisted in a hearing before a House committee this month that he had not \"interfered with the special counsel's investigation in any way.\" 'No obstruction' Trump's lawyers have argued that his firing of Comey and attempts to intervene in personnel decisions in the Justice Department are consistent with his titular authority as the nation's top law enforcement official. In a confidential letter sent to Mueller last year, Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow and his then-colleague John Dowd argued that \"no President has ever faced charges of obstruction merely for exercising his constitutional authority.\"  They said that a President can \"order the termination\" of a Justice Department or FBI investigation \"at any time and for any reason.\" But many legal experts believe that should Mueller establish corrupt intent, the normal standard for an obstruction charge in a criminal case, it could be conduct that could be taken up in the political context of an impeachment case.  Trump's assertion in an NBC News interview that he fired Comey because of the Russia investigation could be evidence for such a finding in any final report that the special counsel decides to file. There is historical precedent for a presidency running into existential peril after an attempt to interfere in the investigative process.  The Articles of Impeachment drawn up against Richard Nixon accused the disgraced former president of \"interfering or endeavoring to interfere with the conduct of investigations by the Department of Justice of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation ... and congressional committees.\" The New York Times reported that Whitaker knew that he could not ask Berman to do what Trump asked and that the President soured on his interim appointee when he could not make the President's legal problems go away. The Cohen case has turned out to be especially troublesome for Trump because it opened a path for prosecutors into his private and business affairs. In a guilty plea, his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, said Trump ordered him to arrange payments to two women who claimed they had affairs with him -- effectively making the President an unindicted co-conspirator in a violation of campaign finance law. Silent circle of assent McCabe told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night while promoting his new book that Trump posed a threat to the FBI and the nation and said it was \"possible\" that the President was a Russian asset. He renewed his charge that he was fired because he had done his duty in initiating an inquiry into Trump's behavior. The White House argues that McCabe has no credibility because he is under criminal investigation for allegedly misleading investigators in their probe of the FBI's handling of the investigation into the Clinton Foundation. But he suggested that an independent departmental report used as justification for his dismissal was improperly influenced by Trump. \"The President very publicly demanded a result and the office of the Inspector General delivered that result ... the President desired that I be gone before I could be eligible to retire.\" White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said on CNN's \"Cuomo Prime Time\" that McCabe was \"a liar, and a leaker.\"  McCabe also revealed Tuesday that he and other senior officials had briefed the \"Gang of Eight\" group of bipartisan leaders of the House and the Senate on the reasons for opening an investigation into Trump. He said there was no pushback from the leaders. \"There was a clear sense in the room that people were resigned to the fact that we had taken a necessary step. That was my impression,\" McCabe said on \"Anderson Cooper 360.\" Trump's alleged propensity to lean on his top law enforcement aides first emerged in stunning public testimony, contemporaneous memos and autobiographical writings written by Comey. Trump told the then FBI director early in his presidency, according to one leaked memo, that \"he needed loyalty and expected loyalty.\" In his book \"A Higher Loyalty,\" Comey wrote that the President's retinue reminded him of the \"silent circle of assent\" around Mafia kingpins he had prosecuted. \"The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and above the truth,\" Comey wrote. Trump clearly expected that the kind of protection he did not get from Comey would come from former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and never forgave him from recusing himself from oversight of Mueller's Russia investigation. \"The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself,\" Trump tweeted on June 5 last year, four months before the attorney general eventually resigned. \"I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!\" Trump added.  The President also several times demanded to know why Sessions had not prosecuted the \"corruption\" of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton -- in a chilling call for a politically motivated investigation against a political opponent.  The President hinted at his belief that the attorney general should serve as a kind of personal legal bodyguard when he voiced his opinion of former Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder. \"I will say this: Holder protected President Obama. Totally protected him,\" Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in December 2017. Preet Bharara, a former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, was fired by Trump but only after the President called him in what the now CNN commentator sees as an attempt to cultivate a relationship. \"He's a kind of a person who doesn't understand that rules have to operate in a particular way and regular order needs to be followed whether it is recusal or arms length distance between a United States attorney or investigator and the President of the United States,\" Bharara told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"The Lead\" on Tuesday.","107":"New York (CNN)By the end of the weekend, Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke could be a Super Bowl champion. But seven hours before kickoff against the New England Patriots, and an ocean away from the big game in Atlanta, another Kroenke-owned sports team might find itself in far less celebratory circumstances. Arsenal, the English Premier League club that billionaire businessman Kroenke has owned since 2011, will travel to play Manchester City on Sunday in a showdown between two soccer teams at very different junctures in their respective histories.  City is the Premier League's defending champion and, though it hasn't matched its record-breaking form of last season, remains in contention to retain its crown and is also a serious contender to secure a first Champions League title, European club football's top cup competition.  Arsenal, meanwhile, is in the midst of another season where it is battling for a top-four finish rather than the title, and is once again struggling to keep pace, both on and off the pitch, with big-spending rivals.  The Londoners' notoriously leaky defense could be humbled at the Etihad on Sunday -- the Gunners lost 5-1 in December to league leaders Liverpool -- making Sunday a two-fold referendum of sorts on Kroenke the sports owner.  With the Rams, Kroenke finds himself on the brink of the American sporting summit, a win away from a championship three years after he helped engineer the team's move from St. Louis to southern California; at Arsenal, the American is viewed increasingly as the man who has overseen the club's wayward drift. Arsenal fans rooting for Patriots Kroenke has become so unpopular among Arsenal supporters that even those who might otherwise be indifferent to American football suddenly have a rooting interest in Super Bowl LIII. \"A lot of fans over here are backing the Patriots,\" said Robbie Lyle, the host and proprietor of the YouTube channel AFTV, which bills itself as the \"unofficial voice of Arsenal fans around the world.\" AFTV has built an enormous following since it launched in 2012, boasting more than 900,000 subscribers who tune in following the team's matches to watch Lyle interview fans, many of whom use the opportunity to rant and rave about the club's shortcomings.  Lately, most of the ire on the channel has been directed at Kroenke. In a video this week following an underwhelming Arsenal victory over lowly Cardiff City, an AFTV regular known as Troopz expressed his annoyance with Kroenke.  \"He don't care, bro,\" Troopz said of the owner. \"Until he goes, it's going to be the same sh*t.\" Public enemy No.1?  In the passionate world of English soccer, a careless owner is public enemy No. 1.  Supporters of Newcastle United, a team that regularly fills its 52,000-seater stadium but only this week broke its transfer record that had stood for 14 years, have staged protests against owner Mike Ashley for years over a lack of proper investment.  At Blackpool F.C., a club in England's third division, fans have boycotted matches over displeasure with the club's owners. Some fans of Manchester United were once so infuriated by ownership that they formed their own club in 2005; F.C. United of Manchester are currently competing in the sixth tier of English football. \"The biggest problem for an owner of a club,\" Lyle told CNN in a phone interview this week, \"is when fans here in the U.K. think you don't care.\" While owning a team may represent a savvy investment for a billionaire like Kroenke, it's considered more than mere business in Europe, where many soccer clubs have been around for more than a century.  Owners of Italian soccer clubs still regularly offer comments after their team's matches, and Arsenal (founded in 1886) was traditionally owned by locals who grew up supporting the team.  \"The idea of what ownership represents in an old fashioned English football club is maybe a little different than what an owner represents in American sports,\" said Amy Lawrence, a soccer writer for The Guardian who specializes in coverage of Arsenal. Kroenke, 71, has a portfolio of sports teams to his name. Along with Arsenal and the Rams, his holding company, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, also oversees the NBA's Denver Nuggets, the Colorado Rapids of MLS and the Colorado Avalanche of the NHL.  The Rams are, it would seem, Kroenke's crown jewel. In 2016, he uprooted the franchise from his native Missouri to bring the Rams back to their original home in Los Angeles. The move left fans in St. Louis bitter, but the NFL's power brokers celebrated the league's return to the country's second biggest market.  Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones lauded Kroenke for having the \"the vision, resources, inspiration and creativity to create the right setting for the NFL in Los Angeles.\" Bill Plaschke, a sports columnist for the Los Angeles Times, gushed in August that Kroenke was the Rams' MVP. \"He gets Los Angeles. He understands its fans. He knows what works, and, man, he's been working it,\" Plaschke wrote. Convincing soccer fans Fans in England still aren't convinced that Kroenke gets Arsenal, and his perceived indifference toward the club can be chalked up to a number of separate but related factors.  There is his reticence, a quality that has earned him the nickname \"Silent Stan\" and has left Arsenal supporters mystified over his plans for the club. He has professed a commitment to winning titles with the club, but such rhetoric is seen by many as perfunctory lip-service. Kroenke's absenteeism has also rankled fans. Lyle lamented that Kroenke failed to attend Arsenal's FA Cup tie with Manchester United last Friday. \"That was the biggest match in Europe [last weekend], and he's not there,\" Lyle said. \"He's never there.\" Kroenke's silence and poor attendance record have helped shape the unfavorable perception of him, but it's the club's stinginess that has cemented the fans' belief that the owner lacks competitive ambition. That point was driven home last month, as Arsenal waded into the January transfer window -- the period of the season when European soccer clubs are able to sign new players -- operating yet again on a relatively shoestring budget. The club brought in midfielder Denis Suarez on loan from Barcelona, with an option to make the deal permanent in the summer, but its ability to sign new players has been dwarfed in recent years by other big English clubs like City, Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool.  Under the ownership of Sheikh Mansour of the Abu Dhabi royal family, City have transformed from a relative afterthought to one of the best teams in Europe with more than a billion pounds spent on players over the last decade.  Arsenal, on the other hand, have continued to follow a \"self-sustaining model,\" under which the club doesn't spend more than it brings in.  The approach is admirable to some fans who scoff at the idea of a club \"buying a title.\" But with players commanding higher transfer fees and salaries, that parsimonious strategy hasn't yielded much silverware for Arsenal in recent years -- other than the FA Cup in 2014, 2015 and 2017.   Lawrence said that \"the whole idea of being self-sustaining faced a massive challenge when the Sheikhs took over at Manchester City.\"  \"It's quite difficult to compete at the highest levels when you're not playing the same financial game as your peers,\" Lawrence told CNN. \"It's not impossible, but it's really, really tough.\" Spending rules In the NFL, as with other major American sports leagues, teams adhere to a salary cap that limits how much they can spend on players -- a factor that complicates the comparison between Kroenke's ownership of the Rams and Arsenal.  UEFA, European soccer's governing body, has instituted financial fair play regulations that ostensibly prohibit clubs from spending more than they earn, but there has long been a sense that the policy might be toothless. A report last year by Der Spiegel claimed that Manchester City circumvented the financial fair play rules, which former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger once dismissed as effectively meaningless. Those differences aside, Kroenke has still demonstrated a significant financial commitment to the Rams with a $1.6 billion investment in the team's stadium complex (total cost: $5 billion), which will open in 2020 and play host to the Super Bowl in 2022.  \"I would love for him to do for Arsenal what he's done for the Rams,\" said Lyle.   Arsenal have been crowned champions of England 13 times -- more than any other club save for Manchester United and Liverpool -- but the team hasn't finished atop the Premier League since the 2003-04 season.  According to soccer finance expert Swiss Ramble, Kroenke hasn't invested any of his own money into the club, a stark contrast from Manchester City's Mansour, who has invested nearly \u00a31.3 billion  of his own fortune since 2008.  City have won the league three times in that span. Arsenal's lack of investment has particularly annoyed fans who point to the club's staggering revenues, which are driven in part by the fact that the team's ticket prices are the highest in England.  On AFTV, some fans have argued that they have spent more money on the club than Kroenke, and there are growing calls to boycott the team's official merchandise as a form of protest against the owner. A spokesman for Arsenal pushed back on the suggestion that the owner isn't committed to the club, saying that Kroenke's son, Josh -- who sits on the club's board -- has attended a number of the team's matches in his father's stead.  The spokesman also argued that, despite being subject to financial fair play rules, Arsenal has invested heavily in new players, including last January's acquisition of star striker Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang, who was signed for a club-record \u00a355 million. \"Stan and Josh Kroenke have been clear with everyone at the club and our fans that their ambition is for Arsenal to compete for and win the top trophies in the game. This includes the Premier League and Champions League,\" said Mark Gonnella, Arsenal's communications and community affairs director. \"The Premier League and UEFA Financial Fair Play rules which apply to all clubs essentially require clubs to operate on a self-funding model, in particular for the P&L impact of player investments. \"In the last three transfer windows we have invested significantly in our playing squad both in terms of transfers, contract extensions and player wages, including twice breaking our transfer record. This has been done with the full support of the owners who are regular visitors to the club and our matches and are in contact with us on a daily basis.  \"As a club we're confident we can reach our goals to compete for and win the major trophies but recognize this will take time and hard work in what is the most competitive league in the world.\" Low approval rating, 100% ownership  Still, there is no denying the frustration from Arsenal fans toward the owner, which manifests itself when Kroenke does turn up to games.  He was booed loudly when he attended the final home match of Wenger's 22-year managerial reign at Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in London last May. Fans have hurled invective in Kroenke's direction by displaying signs and singing profane songs at games, calling for him to leave. After last year's resignation of Wenger, who also faced calls for his departure over the club's declining performances, a plane flew over the stadium during Arsenal's final game of the season carrying a banner with a warning for the owner: \"KROENKE - YOU'RE NEXT!!\"  Lyle estimates that Kroenke's approval rating among Arsenal supporters hovers around one percent. The fans may be stuck with him for a while, though. Kroenke assumed full ownership of the club last year after spending $2.3 billion to buy up all of the remaining shares, including the roughly 800 that were owned by fans.  Ian Wright, a former Arsenal striker who is now a soccer commentator in England, called the takeover \"absolutely disastrous\" and said he wondered if it meant \"the days of seeing [Arsenal] challenging for top honors on a regular basis may well have come and gone.\" The Arsenal Supporters Trust, a group founded in 2003 to broaden supporter ownership of the club, likewise bemoaned the move.  Nigel Phillips, a board member of the trust who owned shares of the club for 25 years before being forced to sell them in September, said he was \"devastated\" by the takeover. \"The fox really now is in the hen house,\" Phillips told CNN in an email. The weekend may bring yet more despair for Arsenal fans, just as the Rams could be entering a glorious new era. \"Come Monday morning, Kroenke might have won the Super Bowl in America,\" Lyle said, \"but we might have been pummeled by Manchester City.\"","108":" (CNN)The New York State Department of Financial Services has opened an inquiry into the Trump Organization's insurance practices, sending a subpoena Monday to the company's longtime insurance broker, according to a person familiar with the matter. The nine-page subpoena, sent to Aon Plc, was issued days after President Donald Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen suggested in testimony to Congress that the Trump Organization had inflated the value of its assets, this person said. A spokeswoman for Aon on Tuesday confirmed receipt of the subpoena. \"We can confirm that we received a subpoena from the New York State Department of Financial Services and, as is our policy, we intend to cooperate with all regulatory bodies,\" the spokeswoman, Donna Mirandola, said in a statement. \"We do not comment on specific client matters.\" A lawyer for the Trump Organization declined to comment to CNN. The subpoena was first reported by The New York Times. The inquiry by the Department of Financial Services adds to a growing collection of investigations concerning Trump's family business, including an ongoing criminal probe out of the Manhattan US attorney's office and a broad document request on Monday by the House Judiciary Committee, which is seeking records from the company and several of its executives. While the Department of Financial Services doesn't have the ability to bring criminal charges, it can refer its findings to state prosecutors for further action. The department regulates financial institutions and insurers, and it can impose significant fines or other penalties if it finds impropriety. During his testimony last week to the House Oversight Committee, Cohen told lawmakers that Trump had provided inflated assets to an insurance company. Asked who knew Trump had done so, Cohen named three Trump Organization executives: Allen Weisselberg, Ron Lieberman and Matthew Calamari. Cohen also suggested in his testimony that the Trump Organization had provided financial statements that showed inflated assets to insurance companies. \"We would provide them with these copies so that they would understand that the premium, which is based sometimes upon the individual's capabilities to pay, would be reduced,\" Cohen said. This story has been updated.","109":" (CNN)When the snow melts, when fields of white turn luscious green leaving no remnants of winter behind, Harry Laidlaw will leave Europe and return to Australia.  The 23-year-old dreams of being like the rest of the world's elite skiers, of following the snow all year round. But financial constraints mean that after spending the last seven months flying down colossal mountains, the Alpine skier must head home, to live with his parents and work on a construction site.  His sole aim will be to earn enough money so that he can slip into his ski boots and hurtle down the slopes when winter returns to Europe's peaks and, just perhaps, become his country's finest skiing export.  Though money does not motivate Laidlaw -- \"what I'm doing now is pretty amazing,\" he says -- he will not progress in the sport without it.  The Australian is not yet one of the world's best Alpine skiers and neither does he come from a country with infinite resources to finance his ambitions, which means reaching the pinnacle is not only a question of talent but economics, too.  It can be a brutal existence, akin to climbing Everest in flip-flops: Few become great without funding, but few want to fund those who aren't great.  READ: Found as a baby dying on the streets, now a champion skier \"It's not easy,\" says Laidlaw in his easygoing Australian manner.  \"Australia doesn't have as many skiers because they quit quite early because we're so far away from home and have to live in Europe for seven months of the year. It's an expensive sport so when there's no support from the federation it's hard to make it work. \"We have a ski federation, but Alpine skiing is not something they support really because we have Scotty James, who is a halfpipe snowboarder, and we have some really good mogul skiers, so a lot of the money and support is driven to them. It's left to us to find sponsors and money to keep it going. \"When I'm home I'm working and trying to make as much money as I can to go towards my skiing. It's purely trying to make enough money to break even by the end.\" READ: Shiffrin in a 'league of her own' By spending the off season on a building site and working at Hotham Alpine Resort in the Victoria, around 132 miles (213km) away from his home city of Melbourne, Laidlaw, with the added support of his parents, keeps alive his dream of climbing up the world rankings.  There have been times, he admits, when he has considered giving up. Times after a bad race or practice session where he wishes he could speak to his brother, once himself a ski racer, or his mum, a former ski instructor. \"Sometimes it feels like I'm alone a lot,\" he says of half a year spent thousands of miles from home.  \"But it's not really hard to get motivated because I have my goals that I want to achieve, and I know the top guys have so much more support around them, so I have to work harder than them to achieve what I want to, or to get to that top level where those guys are,\" says Laidlaw. \"Australia hasn't had a Top 30 giant slalom skier ever so that's one of my goals, to be ranked in the Top 30 and go beyond.\" At the World Ski Championship in Are, Sweden, he finished 37th in the Super G, but did not complete the first run of the Giant Slalom. Ranked 96th in the world in the Giant Slalom and 256th in the Super G, Laidlaw knows he has much to do.  Once a promising AFL player, he could have been on a lucrative contract in Aussie Rules by now, but the skier has no regrets.  Since joining a small private team, Global Racing, a couple of seasons ago, Laidlaw -- who is also studying to be a paramedic -- has never been happier; he is more appreciative of the opportunities that the sport brings; the different cultures, the adrenaline rush of spending his days working at high velocity.  He has made friends, he says, with the 10 skiers of various nationalities who make up the team created by the American coach Paul Epstein. They are a crew of skiers who either have no backing from their country's federation or who are on the fringes of their national team's set-up.  READ: Best photos from the 2019 ski season  \"I'm envious of teams that have physios and equipment guys but, no, I'm really happy at the moment with our team,\" says Laidlaw. \"It is quite special because we're really good friends, whereas I think on those national teams they're all fighting for a spot. From what I see they don't really vibe so well.\" During the season, Laidlaw will train four to five days on the snow, resting on the off-days which will often involve staying with his European teammates \"sleeping on the couch or something.\"  Visit CNN.com\/sport for more news, features and videos He often spends time with teammate Dries Van den Broecke, a Belgian in his second season with Global Racing, who before joining the team would spend his evenings looking online for cheap hotel deals, booking flights or driving to the next race.  Though he now has a coach, a program to follow, teammates to learn from and travel arrangements taken care of, money still is, the 23-year-old says, \"for sure a worry.\" \"We have to pay the program fee, which is $21,000, and we have to pay travel costs. It's a lot of money,\" he says.  \"Luckily enough I found a sponsor to pay a program fee because I don't make enough money yet so my parents have to pay the rest. \"The minimum we spent is around 45,000 euros ($52,000) a year. This year I got 21,000 euros ($24,000) in sponsorship. \"Before I had sponsors it was hard. My parents, mostly my mother, was always talking about the money, it was actually demotivating and you almost start to think it's not worth it.  \"In ski racing, if you're top 15 you can make a living and you have the money.  \"I will make money, but I have to spend it. We are running at the minimum, we're spending the least possible amount.  \"The struggle for money, you have to get over it, because if you keep worrying about that you won't get good results. If you set your mind on the task you have to do, the training, it is beautiful.\" Like Laidlaw, it is a love for skiing, a sport he learned on a dry ski slope in Belgium, that drives Van den Broecke. They both believe they can improve, that they can compete with the best.  \"The big goal is of course the next Olympics,\" says Van den Broecke, while Laidlaw admits that he wants to \"be the best.\"  \"I'm trying not to make it so serious and I think that's when I do well, when I can be free and be enjoying it,\" says Laidlaw.   \"At the moment it's fun and I'm having fun so I think that's the most important thing for me.\"","110":"In this new weekly column \"Cross-exam,\" Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, gives his take on the latest legal news and answers questions from readers. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on \"CNN Newsroom\" at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. In 1974, a special prosecutor subpoenaed Nixon for tape recordings made inside the White House.  The President resisted, asserting executive privilege -- the idea that confidential communications between the President and his advisers must remain secret and beyond the reach of a subpoena. And, in a unanimous 8-0 decision -- including three judges appointed by Nixon himself -- the Supreme Court recognized the concept of executive privilege but rejected its application to Nixon's case.  Nixon was forced to turn over the tapes, and he resigned days later.  This week, we learned that White House lawyers expect to see Mueller's report before it becomes public, to enable them to object based on executive privilege.  Similarly, President Donald Trump's personal counsel Rudy Giuliani stated that he has \"reserved executive privilege and we have a right to assert it.  The only way we can assert it is if we see what is in the report.\"   Trump -- surely aware of the recent 420-0 bipartisan vote in the House calling for full disclosure of the report -- later appeared to claim willingness to the House seeing the report, stating \"I told the House if you want, let them see it.\"  Trump's statement left unaddressed whether he meant the House should see the report in its entirety, or subject to his legal team's objections. If the President's lawyers assert executive privilege, then three crucial decision points will follow: 1. Will Attorney General William Barr show Trump the report in advance?  The special counsel regulations require Mueller to file a \"confidential report\" with Barr, who in turn has broad discretion over whether and how to disseminate factual findings.  It therefore sits squarely in Barr's hands whether to provide the report to Trump's lawyers before he sends it to Congress or the public.    2. If Trump asserts executive privilege, will Barr accept or reject it?  If they do see the report in advance, Trump's legal team likely will assert executive privilege over communications between Trump and his close advisers, including conversations relevant to potential obstruction of justice with former White House counsel Don McGahn (who reportedly refused Trump's order to fire Mueller), former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker (reportedly the recipient of Trump's ire over the Southern District of New York's investigation of Michael Cohen) and others. It is possible that Barr decides on his own to accept Trump's assertion of executive privilege over portions of the report. But Barr could reject those assertions, setting the stage for a legal showdown.  3. If the dispute goes to the courts, who will prevail?  A dispute over executive privilege in Mueller's report could go directly to the Supreme Court (see below for more on this). The Nixon court ruled that executive privilege is meant to protect \"military, diplomatic or sensitive national security secrets\" but not as a general shield against criminal exposure.  Trump might argue that the Nixon case involved production of evidence (the tapes), whereas Trump would object to evidence of spoken conversations, but it is hard to see why that distinction would make a difference in the legal outcome.   Trump's best bet might be to rely on the changing composition of the Supreme Court itself. None of the justices from the Nixon case remains on the bench, and two of the nine current justices are Trump appointees -- one of whom, Brett Kavanaugh, has written that the President enjoys broad powers and protections from criminal processes such as subpoena and indictment.   If the case goes to the Supreme Court, we will see a legal showdown with the highest of stakes. The content of the Mueller report, and the future of Trump's presidency, could hang in the balance.   Meanwhile, this week, we got our first glimpse of the documents prosecutors submitted to a federal judge who authorized the Southern District of New York's April 2018 search warrants on Cohen's home, office and hotel.  I see three big takeaways here.  First, the Cohen investigation started with Mueller in July 2017 -- nearly a year before the SDNY took over the case and searched Cohen's properties.  Even before the SDNY's April 2018 search, prosecutors had ample evidence of crimes committed by Cohen and others.  Second, the SDNY appears to be working toward additional campaign finance charges. The newly unsealed documents include 20 pages of redactions to protect ongoing investigations, and Judge William Pauley noted that the documents \"catalog an assortment of uncharged individuals and detail their involvement in ... the campaign finance charges to which Cohen pled guilty.\"   Third, the documents put to rest the suggestions by Trump and Giuliani that the FBI acted improperly or unfairly when a group of \"stormtroopers\" (per Giuliani) \"broke into\" (per Trump) Cohen's properties. In fact, as the newly released documents make clear, prosecutors went through all proper legal channels and amply demonstrated to a federal judge that they had probable cause to believe Cohen had committed crimes. Throw out the conspiracy theories; these documents prove this case was handled by the book from the start.  Now, your questions Bill, California: At the August 2016 \"Cigar Club\" meeting, Rick Gates, a former Trump campaign aide, was present when Paul Manafort gave polling data to suspected Kremlin-linked Konstantin Kilimnik. Is this why Gates has yet to be sentenced?  Mueller recently requested a postponement of Gates' sentencing because Gates \"continues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations.\"  Prosecutors and cooperating witnesses alike usually seek to postpone sentencing until cooperation is complete. The prosecutor typically wants to keep the cooperator's incentive -- the potential reward of reduced sentencing -- in play until cooperation is complete. The cooperator benefits if the sentencing judge learns about all his cooperation -- and the more cooperation, the better.  In extreme cases involving long-term cooperators, I've seen sentencing postponed for more than eight years.    So, Mueller and perhaps others clearly still have plans for Gates on multiple fronts (\"several ongoing investigations\").  It seems likely that Gates, who was deputy chairman of the Trump inaugural committee, is assisting the SDNY on its investigation of the inaugural committee.   Gates also appears to be cooperating with Mueller on the August 2 Grand Havana Club meeting, during which Manafort gave confidential internal campaign polling data to Kilimnik, who has been linked with Russian intelligence. Gates was present for the meeting, and presumably has told Mueller all about it.   Whether the meeting itself is a crime, or fits into a larger criminal narrative, is one of the biggest remaining questions for Mueller. We know this much: Mueller's team represented in court that the meeting goes \"very much to the heart of what the special counsel's office is investigating.\"  Seems like a hint.  Kai-Lee, Canada: Who would be responsible for changing the Justice Department memo that states a sitting president cannot be indicted federally?  The DOJ policy against indicting a sitting president is just that: a policy.  There is nothing in the Constitution, statute or case law on the issue. Just as DOJ makes its own internal policy, so, too, can DOJ change its policy -- at the discretion of the attorney general.   When I worked at the DOJ from 2004 to 2012, several policies changed. For example, in 2010 Attorney General Eric Holder issued a new policy giving federal prosecutors more discretion to exercise leniency in charging, plea and sentencing decisions. This replaced a stricter policy issued by Attorney General John Ashcroft.   While policy change is merely an attorney general's pen stroke away in theory, do not expect the policy against indicting the sitting president to be changed anytime soon.  The policy has been in place since 1973 and was updated in 2000, so withdrawal would reverse decades of practice spanning multiple administrations. Further, any attorney general faces a political conundrum: By changing the policy, the attorney general places the very person who nominated him or her directly in the firing line.   Such a move would require two things: (1) a belief that the current non-indictment policy is legally flawed, and (2) serious political guts.  Gary, Texas:  I understand DOJ policy states that a sitting president may not be indicted, but is there anything preventing a state from doing so? The DOJ policy against indicting a sitting president is not binding on state-level prosecutors (typically called attorneys general at the statewide level and district attorneys at the county level).  So, at least in theory, any state-level prosecutor who has a provable case against the President may choose to charge it.  If a state-level prosecutor did charge a sitting president, the President almost certainly would argue that he cannot be indicted while in office, which would tee up the issue for the courts.  Exhibit A for the President would be the DOJ policy memo, which acknowledges that there is no clear answer, but also lays out in detailed fashion -- relying on both case law and policy concerns -- the argument against indictment.  The case likely would end up at the US Supreme Court, in which case we would finally get a definitive answer to this perplexing legal issue. Andrew, Florida:  Will any of the investigating bodies examining Trump's world have the prerogative of requesting expedited Supreme Court rulings on cases that bypass the lower courts?  Typically, cases reach the US Supreme Court three ways: (1) appeals from cases heard in the lower federal courts, (2) appeals from decisions of state-level supreme courts, and (3) \"original jurisdiction\" for disputes between two states.  The Supreme Court also has a rule permitting it to take a case before judgment in a lower court \"upon a showing that the case is of such imperative public importance as to justify deviation from normal appellate practice and to require immediate determination in this court.\"  Given the stakes of the ongoing investigation of the President, I would expect that any important legal issue to reach the courts -- for example, indictment of a sitting president or executive privilege -- could qualify for this direct, expedited review by the Supreme Court.   Maria, Colorado: What is the legal definition of conspiracy? Is \"collusion\" a legal term? Are these two related and, if yes, how? \"Collusion\" is not a legal term.  It appears nowhere in the federal criminal code except in obscure antitrust laws irrelevant to the Russian investigation.  Trump and Giuliani have normalized the term through sheer repetition, but \"collusion\" -- perhaps this is why they have put it out there -- has no specific legal meaning and is subject to broad interpretation.   Conspiracy, however, is a crime.  A conspiracy is simply an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, plus some minimal act toward committing the crime.  A prosecutor cannot charge generalized \"conspiracy\" standing alone; there must be a conspiracy to commit some specific crime (called the \"object of the conspiracy\").  For example, Mueller already has charged various conspiracies, including conspiracy to commit computer theft (\"hacking\"), conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy to obstruct justice and conspiracy to obstruct the lawful function of the United States.  So, while \"collusion\" has become a loaded political term, for legal purposes focus not on \"collusion\" -- but rather on conspiracy.    Robert, Maryland: If Trump loses the 2020 election, can he pardon anyone before he leaves the White House? Yes.  Even if Trump loses the election on November 3, 2020, he will remain in office until inauguration day -- January 20, 2021.  And Trump would have the authority to issue pardons up until the moment he leaves office.   Presidents commonly issue pardons during their final days in office, in large part because pardons are inherently unpopular politically.  Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton all issued pardons within days or weeks of leaving office.  Clinton's pardons were particularly controversial; on his final day in office, Clinton pardoned his own brother Roger Clinton and fugitive financier Marc Rich, who fled the United States rather than face federal tax charges. The Rich pardon gave rise to a criminal investigation of potential bribery by the SDNY but never resulted in charges.   Three questions to watch next week: 1) What new information will we learn about the Trump Tower Moscow project when former Trump associate and convicted felon Felix Sater testifies publicly in Congress on March 27? 2) Now that the White House has missed the deadline set by Rep. Jerrold Nadler to provide documents responsive to the House Judiciary Committee's investigation of Trump, will Nadler up the ante by serving subpoenas? 3) With Rod Rosenstein remaining on board at DOJ to serve as a \"heat shield\" for Mueller, what \"heat\" will Mueller generate in the coming weeks?
