Before Friday\u2019s results, some economists had been worried about a \u201cMarch jinx\u201d and a new setback in the steady month on month growth of the US labour market. But collapsing oil prices and worries that a slowdown in China will impact global trade do not appear to have impacted hiring so far. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 5%, driven up by a larger number of people looking for work. In January the unemployment rate dropped below 5% for the first time since 2008 and had remained there for the first two months of the year. The news is likely to bolster the Federal Reserve\u2019s case for further interest rate rises, although the Fed chair, Janet Yellen, said this week that the central bank is likely to slow the pace of rate hikes this year. \u201cThe sustained robust pace of job creation and accelerating wage growth should in theory bolster the Fed\u2019s commitment to normalising policy with at least two further rate hikes this year,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.

Demand plummeted for what are popularly known as RVs, the wheeled apartments in which Americans tour their country, and unemployment in Elkhart surged to nearly 20%.</p> <p>One of Bumpas\u2019s brothers and his two sisters were laid off, too, and moved in with him along with their children.

He used almost all his savings to pay the mortgage and care for his own three children as a single parent while picking up part-time work.</p> <p>To compound Bumpas\u2019s misery, Barack Obama kept turning up in Elkhart promising to make things better.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was a joke. He said he was going to be there for us. He didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Bumpas.</p> <p>The president might legitimately claim credit for rescuing the US economy and pulling Elkhart back from the brink. Demand for RVs has bounced back and manufacturing is booming again in the county, which makes 80% of motorhomes built in the US . The RV industry employs more than 40,000 people in the county.</p> <p>As a result, the jobless rate has plummeted from one of the highest in the country to 3.8% in the city of Elkhart, well below the national average. Bumpas is back in full-time work servicing motorhomes.</p> <p>But he, like many in Elkhart from the mayor to the owners of RV businesses, sees no reason to give much credit to Washington for financial policies that helped revive the area\u2019s economy or the US president for the attention he has paid. Instead, it\u2019s the Republicans\u2019 anti-government message that frequently has resonance around Elkhart County \u2013 and particularly Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that the key to prosperity is to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/25/us-president-donald-trump-first-100-days-election-2016\">run the country as if it were a business</a>.</p> <p>Obama won Indiana by a tiny margin in 2008, the first Democratic presidential candidate to do so in more than 40 years. But he lost heavily in the state in 2012 and took just 36% of the vote in Elkhart County.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">This year\u2019s presidential race</a> promises to be a tighter contest in Indiana but Bumpas isn\u2019t impressed by the choice of candidates.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s picking the best of the evils,\u201d he said before declining to say what he thought of the contenders or who he would vote for.</p> <p>One of Bumpas\u2019s co-workers, PJ McGann, who was also laid off in 2008 after 14 years working for one of the country\u2019s biggest RV makers, was more forthright.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re very limited with our options. If Bernie gets in there, it\u2019ll be worse than Obama. I\u2019m torn. I definitely don\u2019t want Hillary,\u201d he said. \u201cI do believe that the country needs somebody that\u2019s not tied to the political establishment. I believe Trump could actually do the job. I haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019m going to vote for him or not. I\u2019d like to do some more research on that.\u201d</p> <p>They were agreed on one thing.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want another Obama,\u201d said Bumpas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"368100016cd17fb7ee235a3a4045a3f1799ada72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/368100016cd17fb7ee235a3a4045a3f1799ada72/0_102_5760_3455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elkhart Sales and Service general manger Tom Bumpus in Elkhart, Indiana on 25 March 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Elkhart Sales and Service general manager, Tom Bumpas, in Elkhart, Indiana on 25 March 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Lott for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I didn\u2019t ask for it. I like to hold my own\u2019</h2> <p>Obama visited Elkhart four times in 16 months at the peak of the economic crisis, first as a presidential candidate in 2008. Not long after, Bumpas lost his job in research and design at one of the biggest RV factories in the city, Monaco Coach, when it declared bankruptcy and laid off 1,400 people.</p> <p>It looked to some in Elkhart as if its biggest industry might follow other once-thriving local businesses such as drug manufacturing. An Elkhart company invented Alka-Seltzer in the 1930s and was eventually bought out by the German pharmaceutical giant, Bayer. It made Elkhart the headquarters of its US operation, employing 3,000 people and manufacturing close to $1bn of medicines and vitamins annually. But a decade ago Bayer shut the plant after moving to Philadelphia and all that is left of its once-sprawling headquarters is a 25-acre field.</p> <p>Elkhart also had a longstanding claim to be the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer of trumpets, trombones and other musical instruments. But that too has declined, in part because of foreign competition.</p> <p>During the campaign, Obama promised funds to help Elkhart find a path out of its dependency on the RV industry. Shortly after he moved into the White House the new president returned to the city to say he would make good on that pledge with money from his $787bn stimulus package.</p> <p>But in Elkhart the jobs kept disappearing. In February 2009, another two major RV manufacturers cut 600 workers. Unemployment in the area rose to 19.6%.</p> <p>By then Bumpas had found and lost another job when half of the staff were laid off because of the economic crisis. He struggled by, taking unemployment benefit but refusing other government assistance such as food stamps.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for it. I\u2019m not that type of person. I like to hold my own,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a very supportive family. Mom and dad. Nobody goes hungry in our family.\u201d</p> <p>Marvin Miller saw the crisis from the other end. He owned a company supplying RV manufacturers with fittings such as lights and tow bars.</p> <p>When Monaco Coach filed for bankruptcy, Miller not only lost a customer but was left holding large unpaid bills. Business dried up.</p> <p>\u201cThe cost to me personally was millions even as a small businessman. I had 15 employees. I got down to four of us. Many of them were family that I had to let go. Friends, people that have been with me a long time. So it was very, very devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that year, 22 builders of RVs, travel trailers, motorhomes went out of business. My challenge at that time was, I don\u2019t care how bad it is I am going to survive.\u201d</p> <p>Obama was back in Elkhart again in August 2009, promising funds to establish the manufacture of environmentally friendly vehicles such as electric cars and trucks.</p> <p>Federal stimulus funds lured three companies and offered the promise of 3,000 new jobs. Obama announced a $39m grant to help Navistar build electric vehicles at the old Monaco factory. He spoke in front of an electric truck later revealed to have been built in the UK.</p> <p>The new plants drew excited predictions from Indiana\u2019s governor that they would make Elkhart the US capital of electric and hybrid vehicles. But within a few years all of the ventures collapsed or pulled out. All the city of Elkhart has to show for it are two electric cars bought for official business.</p> <p>Bumpas regarded the whole exercise as a cynical ploy.</p> <p>\u201cNavistar are a multibillion-dollar company. They did not need the money. That\u2019s like handing Donald Trump money. It was a kind of a dog and pony show to make Obama look good in my opinion. And he come back and said: \u2018We didn\u2019t forget about you. See, we\u2019ve got these electric trucks going.\u2019 The money went away, the trucks went away,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Miller wasn\u2019t impressed either.</p> <p>\u201cTo me that was all political, had no purpose. He promised the world. It meant nothing. It absolutely had no benefit to this town,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Others in the city came to suspect that companies were just in it for the subsidies and when these dried up they left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"353976bdc10705f0bc462fd07a39a47dc01fbe1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/353976bdc10705f0bc462fd07a39a47dc01fbe1a/0_385_5760_3455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aspenwald Avenue in Elkhart, Indiana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aspenwald Avenue in Elkhart, Indiana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Lott for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2> \u2018The president does not have as much power as people think\u2019</h2> <p>There are more forgiving views of Obama\u2019s efforts. The railway tracks that run through Elkhart divide the neatly preserved old downtown from the more dilapidated neighbourhood housing much of the city\u2019s substantial minority population.</p> <p>\u201cI went to see Obama speak at the school,\u201d said Ana Morales, a mother who held a part-time job in an RV supply company before the recession and now does cleaning work. \u201cHe wanted to help us. He was sincere. But he is one man and the president does not have as much power as people think. He is not the president who put people out of work. People need to remember this.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, the key to Elkhart\u2019s recovery turned out to be the old stalwart, the RV. As the US economy improved so did demand for mobile homes. Two manufacturers took over the old Monaco plant. Employment rose, median income returned to pre-crisis levels and the poverty rate fell to its lowest point since 2008. RV manufacturers say they are now having trouble finding enough new workers to meet expansion.</p> <p>Miller established a company, Elkhart Sales and Service, offering RV maintenance. Bumpas did some one-off jobs there but when business picked up he began to work full time.</p> <p>So does Obama at least deserve credit from building the economy back up? Bumpas scoffs.</p> <p>\u201cEr \u2026 well, I don\u2019t know. In my personal opinion it\u2019s whoever controls the fuel prices. They have dropped drastically which allows people to do more with these RVs and stuff,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McGann also ended up working for Miller after losing his job in the paint shop at Monaco Coach.</p> <p>\u201cAt the time I was pretty panicked. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McGann, 45, is also hesitant to credit the president for the reversal in Elkhart\u2019s fortunes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not that knowledgeable. I\u2019d have to dig into it a bit more. Possibly. I just believe that the economy in the United States, in my opinion, is always on a 10-year cycle. Just like fashion, it comes and goes,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Elkhart\u2019s Republican mayor, Timothy Neese, offers faint praise for Obama for visiting the city.</p> <p>\u201cI think he deserves some of the credit. Any time a sitting president comes to the community, that\u2019s a major undertaking regardless of the economy. So I\u2019m willing to indicate that I think the president\u2019s presence here was certainly a positive encounter for us,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But asked if Obama deserves credit for reviving the US economy and so the RV industry, Neese said that was less to do with the president and more Indiana cutting taxes and attracting businesses.</p> <p>That\u2019s a view that chimes with McGann\u2019s politics and is steering him toward Trump in the election. He\u2019s been put off by some of the things the New York celebrity businessman said but is prepared to excuse him.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s got some issues. But who doesn\u2019t?\u201d said McGann. \u201cThe negativity Trump brings to himself is the crude behaviour, the comments. People say: \u2018He\u2019s a pompous ass.\u2019 So what? That doesn\u2019t mean to say he\u2019s not going to do a good job. Anybody can be rude, crude and obnoxious. That doesn\u2019t mean to say they\u2019re not good at their job. He just has a twisted sense of humour. Big deal.\u201d</p> <p>Miller leaned toward Republican contender Marco Rubio when he was still in the race. Now he\u2019s had to look elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cDonald initially brought a lot to the table and I wish I could talk to him personally because all I\u2019ve seen at this standpoint was a business plan to run for president. It\u2019s all about Donald,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s done it very well. Create turmoil right from coming out of the chute. Piss off everybody that you can. Publicity. It\u2019s a business plan. What better way to promote Trump Enterprises forever than to run for president? All that free exposure all over the world.</p> <p>\u201cDo I like some of what he says? No. Everybody\u2019s been offended. That\u2019s wrong. Get rid of the child play. What really are you going to do? I think he could do it fine. The art of the negotiation he\u2019d be very good at.\u201d</p>",

He didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Bumpas. The president might legitimately claim credit for rescuing the US economy and pulling Elkhart back from the brink. Demand for RVs has bounced back and manufacturing is booming again in the county, which makes 80% of motorhomes built in the US . The RV industry employs more than 40,000 people in the county. As a result, the jobless rate has plummeted from one of the highest in the country to 3.8% in the city of Elkhart, well below the national average. Bumpas is back in full-time work servicing motorhomes. But he, like many in Elkhart from the mayor to the owners of RV businesses, sees no reason to give much credit to Washington for financial policies that helped revive the area\u2019s economy or the US president for the attention he has paid. Instead, it\u2019s the Republicans\u2019 anti-government message that frequently has resonance around Elkhart County \u2013 and particularly Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that the key to prosperity is to run the country as if it were a business. Obama won Indiana by a tiny margin in 2008, the first Democratic presidential candidate to do so in more than 40 years. But he lost heavily in the state in 2012 and took just 36% of the vote in Elkhart County. This year\u2019s presidential race promises to be a tighter contest in Indiana but Bumpas isn\u2019t impressed by the choice of candidates. \u201cIt\u2019s picking the best of the evils,\u201d he said before declining to say what he thought of the contenders or who he would vote for. One of Bumpas\u2019s co-workers, PJ McGann, who was also laid off in 2008 after 14 years working for one of the country\u2019s biggest RV makers, was more forthright. \u201cI think we\u2019re very limited with our options. If Bernie gets in there, it\u2019ll be worse than Obama. I\u2019m torn. I definitely don\u2019t want Hillary,\u201d he said. \u201cI do believe that the country needs somebody that\u2019s not tied to the political establishment. I believe Trump could actually do the job. I haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019m going to vote for him or not. I\u2019d like to do some more research on that.\u201d They were agreed on one thing. \u201cWe don\u2019t want another Obama,\u201d said Bumpas. \u2018I didn\u2019t ask for it. I like to hold my own\u2019 Obama visited Elkhart four times in 16 months at the peak of the economic crisis, first as a presidential candidate in 2008. Not long after, Bumpas lost his job in research and design at one of the biggest RV factories in the city, Monaco Coach, when it declared bankruptcy and laid off 1,400 people. It looked to some in Elkhart as if its biggest industry might follow other once-thriving local businesses such as drug manufacturing. An Elkhart company invented Alka-Seltzer in the 1930s and was eventually bought out by the German pharmaceutical giant, Bayer. It made Elkhart the headquarters of its US operation, employing 3,000 people and manufacturing close to $1bn of medicines and vitamins annually. But a decade ago Bayer shut the plant after moving to Philadelphia and all that is left of its once-sprawling headquarters is a 25-acre field. Elkhart also had a longstanding claim to be the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer of trumpets, trombones and other musical instruments. But that too has declined, in part because of foreign competition. During the campaign, Obama promised funds to help Elkhart find a path out of its dependency on the RV industry. Shortly after he moved into the White House the new president returned to the city to say he would make good on that pledge with money from his $787bn stimulus package. But in Elkhart the jobs kept disappearing. In February 2009, another two major RV manufacturers cut 600 workers. Unemployment in the area rose to 19.6%. By then Bumpas had found and lost another job when half of the staff were laid off because of the economic crisis. He struggled by, taking unemployment benefit but refusing other government assistance such as food stamps. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for it. I\u2019m not that type of person. I like to hold my own,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a very supportive family. Mom and dad. Nobody goes hungry in our family.\u201d Marvin Miller saw the crisis from the other end. He owned a company supplying RV manufacturers with fittings such as lights and tow bars. When Monaco Coach filed for bankruptcy, Miller not only lost a customer but was left holding large unpaid bills. Business dried up. \u201cThe cost to me personally was millions even as a small businessman. I had 15 employees. I got down to four of us. Many of them were family that I had to let go. Friends, people that have been with me a long time. So it was very, very devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that year, 22 builders of RVs, travel trailers, motorhomes went out of business. My challenge at that time was, I don\u2019t care how bad it is I am going to survive.\u201d Obama was back in Elkhart again in August 2009, promising funds to establish the manufacture of environmentally friendly vehicles such as electric cars and trucks. Federal stimulus funds lured three companies and offered the promise of 3,000 new jobs. Obama announced a $39m grant to help Navistar build electric vehicles at the old Monaco factory. He spoke in front of an electric truck later revealed to have been built in the UK. The new plants drew excited predictions from Indiana\u2019s governor that they would make Elkhart the US capital of electric and hybrid vehicles. But within a few years all of the ventures collapsed or pulled out. All the city of Elkhart has to show for it are two electric cars bought for official business. Bumpas regarded the whole exercise as a cynical ploy. \u201cNavistar are a multibillion-dollar company. They did not need the money. That\u2019s like handing Donald Trump money. It was a kind of a dog and pony show to make Obama look good in my opinion. And he come back and said: \u2018We didn\u2019t forget about you. See, we\u2019ve got these electric trucks going.\u2019 The money went away, the trucks went away,\u201d he said. Miller wasn\u2019t impressed either. \u201cTo me that was all political, had no purpose. He promised the world. It meant nothing. It absolutely had no benefit to this town,\u201d he said. Others in the city came to suspect that companies were just in it for the subsidies and when these dried up they left. \u2018The president does not have as much power as people think\u2019 There are more forgiving views of Obama\u2019s efforts. The railway tracks that run through Elkhart divide the neatly preserved old downtown from the more dilapidated neighbourhood housing much of the city\u2019s substantial minority population. \u201cI went to see Obama speak at the school,\u201d said Ana Morales, a mother who held a part-time job in an RV supply company before the recession and now does cleaning work. \u201cHe wanted to help us. He was sincere. But he is one man and the president does not have as much power as people think. He is not the president who put people out of work. People need to remember this.\u201d In the end, the key to Elkhart\u2019s recovery turned out to be the old stalwart, the RV. As the US economy improved so did demand for mobile homes. Two manufacturers took over the old Monaco plant. Employment rose, median income returned to pre-crisis levels and the poverty rate fell to its lowest point since 2008. RV manufacturers say they are now having trouble finding enough new workers to meet expansion. Miller established a company, Elkhart Sales and Service, offering RV maintenance. Bumpas did some one-off jobs there but when business picked up he began to work full time. So does Obama at least deserve credit from building the economy back up? Bumpas scoffs. \u201cEr \u2026 well, I don\u2019t know. In my personal opinion it\u2019s whoever controls the fuel prices. They have dropped drastically which allows people to do more with these RVs and stuff,\u201d he said. McGann also ended up working for Miller after losing his job in the paint shop at Monaco Coach. \u201cAt the time I was pretty panicked. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do,\u201d he said. McGann, 45, is also hesitant to credit the president for the reversal in Elkhart\u2019s fortunes. \u201cI\u2019m not that knowledgeable. I\u2019d have to dig into it a bit more. Possibly. I just believe that the economy in the United States, in my opinion, is always on a 10-year cycle. Just like fashion, it comes and goes,\u201d he said. Elkhart\u2019s Republican mayor, Timothy Neese, offers faint praise for Obama for visiting the city. \u201cI think he deserves some of the credit. Any time a sitting president comes to the community, that\u2019s a major undertaking regardless of the economy. So I\u2019m willing to indicate that I think the president\u2019s presence here was certainly a positive encounter for us,\u201d he said. But asked if Obama deserves credit for reviving the US economy and so the RV industry, Neese said that was less to do with the president and more Indiana cutting taxes and attracting businesses. That\u2019s a view that chimes with McGann\u2019s politics and is steering him toward Trump in the election. He\u2019s been put off by some of the things the New York celebrity businessman said but is prepared to excuse him. \u201cTrump\u2019s got some issues. But who doesn\u2019t?\u201d said McGann. \u201cThe negativity Trump brings to himself is the crude behaviour, the comments. People say: \u2018He\u2019s a pompous ass.\u2019 So what? That doesn\u2019t mean to say he\u2019s not going to do a good job. Anybody can be rude, crude and obnoxious. That doesn\u2019t mean to say they\u2019re not good at their job. He just has a twisted sense of humour. Big deal.\u201d Miller leaned toward Republican contender Marco Rubio when he was still in the race. Now he\u2019s had to look elsewhere. \u201cDonald initially brought a lot to the table and I wish I could talk to him personally because all I\u2019ve seen at this standpoint was a business plan to run for president. It\u2019s all about Donald,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s done it very well. Create turmoil right from coming out of the chute. Piss off everybody that you can. Publicity. It\u2019s a business plan. What better way to promote Trump Enterprises forever than to run for president? All that free exposure all over the world. \u201cDo I like some of what he says? No. Everybody\u2019s been offended. That\u2019s wrong. Get rid of the child play. What really are you going to do? I think he could do it fine. The art of the negotiation he\u2019d be very good at.\u201d",

The consequences of a vote to leave wouldn\u2019t just be felt temporarily. There would likely be a permanent reduction in exports to the EU, while foreign-direct investment into the UK would also suffer, leading to higher unemployment and a decline in the country\u2019s long-term growth potential. Furthermore, negotiations to leave would be complex and difficult. EU leaders would not be expected to give the UK an easy ride for fear of encouraging others to follow.</p> <p>Looking further ahead, the likely reduction in exports to the EU could reduce national income by three per cent, rising to as much as ten per cent in a worst-case scenario. Finally, the long-term growth potential of the UK could also be negatively impacted by, amongst other things, lower foreign direct investment. While any estimate of that effect is highly speculative, it could potentially shave 0.2-0.4 percentage points off growth.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3d85a6a7f10c4049bd1c554965109955080df8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d85a6a7f10c4049bd1c554965109955080df8c/66_314_5629_3377/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aviva Investors warns on Brexit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aviva Investors warns on Brexit</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Financial markets would undoubtedly react badly to a vote in favour of \u2018Brexit\u2019 too. Aviva Investors would expect an immediate and sharp fall in the pound. The UK runs comparatively large fiscal and current account deficits, and as such relies on foreign capital to finance the deficiency in domestic saving. If, as anticipated, the uncertainty created by a vote to leave causes international investors to re-appraise their appetite for sterling assets, the decline in the pound could become more severe over time.</p> <p>While the Bank of England would no doubt ease policy in response to any economic downturn, it seems unlikely this would prevent UK share prices from falling sharply. In particular, shares in smaller companies, which tend to rely more on the domestic economy, would probably underperform. The impact on gilts is less clear.

Monetary conditions are tighter than desired, mainly because of Japan\u2019s safe-haven status in the markets, which leads to a strong yen.</p> <p>The task for other Asia-Pacific economies will be to ensure that flexible markets and sound policies will help them to adjust successfully to China\u2019s new growth drivers.</p> <p>One of the countries to watch for a successful response to China\u2019s rebalancing is Australia. We think that all of the pieces to make this happen are in place--including exchange rate and factor market flexibility, strong government, and nimble financing--but it may take time.

Negative inflation has been enticing to consumers and stores are profiting. Besides that, the unemployment rate continued to decline in February, which is helping disposable income grow. </p> <p>The months ahead could still be bleaker though as the labour market has lost a bit of its momentum in the first months of the year and today\u2019s Eurozone service sector PMI indicated a slowdown of growth in March.

With the manufacturing and construction PMIs remaining little changed (but at least staying in growth territory) the overall composite index has risen to 53.6 from 52.7. This is still well down on the average level of 2015 and suggests that the UK economy has lost momentum at the start of the year.</p> <p>An obvious factor behind this is the upcoming referendum on the UK\u2019s ongoing membership of the European Union. With opinion polls suggesting that the vote will be incredibly close, businesses are likely to act cautiously and not embark on any significant expansion plans until the economic outlook is clearer. This means that investment and labour hiring plans will be more limited, which is something that was also highlighted in the recent Deloitte CFO survey. As such, the economy looks set to post slower growth in the second quarter of 2016 than in first quarter.</p> <p>Should the UK vote to remain within the EU then we suggest that the slowdown will be temporary and the delayed hiring and investment plans will be re\u2014instated, leading to a decent bounce in activity in the second half of 2016.</p> <p>However, should the UK vote to leave then expansion plans are likely to be cancelled, business and consumer sentiment will take a hit and the Bank of England would likely have to step in with policy stimulus to try and shore-up confidence.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57037b75e4b0fde262ff64b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T08:47:00.588Z\">9.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Still, it was at least growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RBS_Economics/status/717271838548692992\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Weakest UK service sector growth since Q1 2013, but growth none the less and March&#39;s number was a slight improvement <a href=\"https://t.co/TS6rM42Xi3\">pic.twitter.com/TS6rM42Xi3</a></p>&mdash; RBS Economics (@RBS_Economics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RBS_Economics/status/717271838548692992\">April 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-570379dde4b0d29fa4d0c821\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T08:42:57.206Z\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The PMI figures seem to suggest a UK interest rate rise is indeed some way off.

The surveys point to a 0.4% increase in GDP, down from 0.6% in the closing quarter of last year. </p> <p>Across the three main sectors of the economy, firms reported the smallest increase in demand for just over three years, which in turn fed through to a reluctance to take on new staff. March saw the weakest rate of job creation for over two-and-a-half years. </p> <p>Business confidence remains in the doldrums as concerns about the global economy continue to be exacerbated by uncertainty at home, with nerves unsettled by issues such as Brexit and the prospect of further government spending cuts announced in the Budget.</p> <p>It therefore seems unlikely that March\u2019s upturn in the pace of growth represents the start of a longer term upswing. In contrast, the survey data suggest growth is more likely to weaken further in the second quarter.

This increase is largely due to growing common exposures to aggregate risk, caused partly by a rise in insurers\u2019 interest rate sensitivity. Thus, in the event of an adverse shock, insurers are unlikely to fulfill their role as financial intermediaries precisely when other parts of the financial system are failing to do so as well. The higher common exposures do not seem to be driven by marked changes in insurers\u2019 investment portfolios, although smaller and weaker insurers in some countries have taken on more risk.</p> <p>The findings suggest that supervisors and regulators should take a more macroprudential approach to the sector. Doing so is necessary if supervision is to go beyond guarding against the solvency and contagion risks of individ- ual firms and take on the systemic risk arising from common exposures. Steps that would complement a push for stronger macroprudential policies include the international adoption of capital and transparency standards for the sector. In addition, the different behavior of smaller and weaker insurers warrants attention by supervisors. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d7e255ca92620d3a7cfea6694f46dd64ca0776a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d7e255ca92620d3a7cfea6694f46dd64ca0776a/0_0_584_637/458.jpg\" alt=\"Relative size of financial firms\" width=\"458\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Relative size of financial firms</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IMF</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57036073e4b0f2216ccb2a59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T07:02:02.180Z\">8.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Policymakers need to act to prevent problems in emerging markets threatening global stability, the IMF has said.</p> <p>In <strong><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2016/POL040416B.htm\">excerpts from its latest financial stability report</a></strong> the fund said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The financial integration of emerging market economies into the global economy has affected international financial markets in both desirable ways\u2014more efficient asset prices and resource allocation\u2014and undesirable ones\u2014amplification of shocks and transmission of excess financial volatility...</p> <p>The significant growth in global capital flows due to mutual fund investments is also affecting the nature and size of financial spillovers from emerging market economies. The decision by mutual funds to sell investments in multiple countries in response to losses in one or more countries, or because of withdrawals by their own investors, is called the portfolio channel of contagion. This channel has gained in importance as a source of financial spillovers from emerging market economies to equity markets in recent years, in line with the increase in asset allocation to these countries. The impact from the portfolio channel from advanced economies remains significantly larger, according to the IMF.</p> </blockquote> <p>The IMF says the influence of China will grow as it becomes more integrated into the global financial system:</p> <blockquote> <p>The IMF research shows that among large emerging market economies, China is unique: news about its economic growth has an economically significant and rising impact on global equity prices. In the last five years alone, the impact of growth surprises from China on global equity prices has almost quadrupled. By contrast, changes in Chinese asset prices tend to have little effect on asset prices elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cPurely financial spillovers from China are still very small, but likely to grow considerably as China gradually continues to integrate into the global financial system,\u201d said Gaston Gelos, head of the Global Financial Stability Analysis Division at the IMF.</p> </blockquote> <p>So policymakers need to act to safeguard financial stability in the wake of the growing importance of emerging markets:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe evidence underscores the need for policymakers to take into account economic and policy developments in emerging market economies when assessing their own countries\u2019 prospects,\u201d said Gelos. </p> <p>Enhanced international economic and macroprudential policy cooperation can also play an important role.</p> <p>Other policy measures countries need to implement include:</p> <p>\u2022 In emerging market economies, policymakers can foster the development of a domestic investor base to help dampen the effect of international financial contagion.</p> <p>\u2022 As China\u2019s role in the global financial system continues to grow, policymakers will need clear and timely communication of policy decisions, transparency about policy goals, and strategies to achieve them. </p> <p>\u2022 The amplification of emerging markets\u2019 financial impact on other countries due to corporate debt means policymakers should adopt measures to limit excessive increases in corporate debt that could threaten financial stability. Improving rules to limit systemic risks arising from mutual funds also remains important.</p> <p>\u2022 Lastly, improving data on cross-border financial flows intermediated by banks, investment funds, and large institutional investors is a priority. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57035cebe4b0d29fa4d0c7f7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T06:40:31.164Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">German industrial orders in surprise fall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>German factory orders fell unexpectedly in February, according to figures from the economy ministry, hit by a decline in overseas demand.</p> <p>They dropped 1.2%, the biggest monthly fall in six months and well below expectations of a 0.2% rise.

                "bodyText":"The US service sector grew by more than forecast in March, according to Markit, but not enough to mask concerns about the overall state of the world\u2019s largest economy The services final PMI came in at 51.3 compared to an initial estimate of 51 and the 49.7 figure for February. The composite PMI - services and manufacturing - rose from 50 in February to 51.3 in March, up from the first reading of 51.1. But the new business index hit its lowest level since the survey began in October 2009. \uf0a7 Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: The welcome news of sustained robust hiring in March, as indicated by both the PMI surveys and non-farm payroll numbers, masks a more worrying picture of a further slowing in economic growth so far this year. The survey data, which have historically provided a reliable guide to official GDP numbers, suggest the annualized pace of economic growth weakened to 0.7% in the first quarter. Demand is growing at the slowest rate since late- 2009 and, with business optimism also sliding to its weakest since the recession, firms clearly expect worse to come. Firms are worried about a potential weakening of demand both at home and abroad in the face of various headwinds. As such, the data support the cautious approach to policy tightening currently advocated by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll back tomorrow. The combination of volatile oil prices, the IMF warning of risks to the global economy, and a spate of uninspiring economic data has seen Wall Street follow other markets into the red. On top of all that, there is the added wrinkle of uncertainty over the path of US interest rates, ahead of Wednesday\u2019s release of the minutes from the March Federal Reserve meeting. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 105 points or 0.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.4% and Nasdaq 0.7% at the open. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 2.5% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 2.3%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is currently down 1.1%. America\u2019s trade deficit widened by more than expected in February, up 2.6% to $47.1bn rather than the $46.2bn forecast by analysts. An revival in exports was offset by an increase in imports, making the deficit the highest since August. With the yen at a 17 month high against the dollar despite Japan\u2019s negative interest rates, it is no surprise there have been suggestions the country\u2019s central bank could be prepared to act again. Now Reuters is reporting that it will consider further measures at its meeting this month: Bank of Japan policymakers will likely debate the possibility of easing monetary policy further at a rate review this month, as a raft of gloomy data threatens their scenario that a moderate economic recovery will accelerate inflation towards a 2 percent target, sources familiar with their thinking said. If the central bank were to act, it would more likely increase asset purchases than cut interest rates, the sources said, as financial institutions are still scrambling to adjust to a negative rate policy deployed in January. But a decision on whether to ease at the April 27-28 review will be a close call as many BOJ officials are wary of using their limited policy tools again so soon, especially as the negative rate move has proved unpopular among the public. \u201cIt will be a question of whether the BOJ feels it has forestalled risks in January or whether they feel that January\u2019s action wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d said one of the people familiar with the BOJ\u2019s thinking. The BOJ stunned markets in January by adding negative interest rates to its massive asset-buying programme, dubbed \u201cquantitative and qualitative easing,\u201d to forestall the risk of external headwinds derailing a fragile economic recovery. But the move failed to boost stock prices or arrest an unwelcome yen rise, drawing criticism from lawmakers and investors as confusing rather than calming markets. The latest warning from the IMF follows a familiar pattern, but the fund has to do more than just talk, says Larry Elliott. It needs to act as well. His full analysis is here: Britain could enter a recession at the end of 2016 if it votes to leave the European Union, according to strategists at Aviva Investors. They said: Aviva Investors believes that if the UK were to vote to leave the EU, there would be a significant and negative knock-on effect on business sentiment, which would likely push the UK economy into recession towards the end of this year. The consequences of a vote to leave wouldn\u2019t just be felt temporarily. There would likely be a permanent reduction in exports to the EU, while foreign-direct investment into the UK would also suffer, leading to higher unemployment and a decline in the country\u2019s long-term growth potential. Furthermore, negotiations to leave would be complex and difficult. EU leaders would not be expected to give the UK an easy ride for fear of encouraging others to follow. Looking further ahead, the likely reduction in exports to the EU could reduce national income by three per cent, rising to as much as ten per cent in a worst-case scenario. Finally, the long-term growth potential of the UK could also be negatively impacted by, amongst other things, lower foreign direct investment. While any estimate of that effect is highly speculative, it could potentially shave 0.2-0.4 percentage points off growth. Financial markets would undoubtedly react badly to a vote in favour of \u2018Brexit\u2019 too. Aviva Investors would expect an immediate and sharp fall in the pound. The UK runs comparatively large fiscal and current account deficits, and as such relies on foreign capital to finance the deficiency in domestic saving. If, as anticipated, the uncertainty created by a vote to leave causes international investors to re-appraise their appetite for sterling assets, the decline in the pound could become more severe over time. While the Bank of England would no doubt ease policy in response to any economic downturn, it seems unlikely this would prevent UK share prices from falling sharply. In particular, shares in smaller companies, which tend to rely more on the domestic economy, would probably underperform. The impact on gilts is less clear. They may benefit from some domestic safe-haven flows, but at the same time, many international investors will be looking to sell. The continuing slide in crude prices follows the growing belief that a meeting in Doha this month to discuss production freezes to deal with the supply glut may not come up with anything concrete. So oil could see further volatility ahead, according to Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst Nordic bank SEB: The latest price moves to the downside was an accident waiting to happen as far as we can see. We never could believe why much hope at all was placed on the production freeze discussion and the connected Doha meeting on 17 April. Nonetheless it probably helped to hold Brent in a sideways trading range during most of March as well as helping to build up a record net long speculative position in Brent crude. Then with Saudi Arabia\u2019s straight talk on production freeze placing the whole issue in the Iranian camp, the continuous building in Brent speculation halted and is now instead in reverse. Crude is also being hit by an unexpected fall in gasoline demand in the US, as revealed by the Energy Information Administration on Monday. In the wake of the IMF worrying about emerging markets, ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s reckons the Asia-Pacific region will still lead global growth this year despite its tumultuous start to the year. In a new report, it said: \u201cWe believe the market\u2019s concerns leading up to the sell-off in global markets, while having some validity, were overdone--and even a bit misguided,\u201d said Paul Gruenwald, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s chief economist for Asia-Pacific. \u201cWe think that the real challenge is picking up the pace of structural reforms China needs to implement as it moves toward a more consumption- and services-based model with a greater role for the marketplace.\u201d Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s GDP forecast for the region is little changed from November 2015 at 5.3% for 2016 and 5.2% for 2017. \u201cIndia leads the pack with GDP growth projection of 7.9% for the fiscal year ending March 2017. But this is one-cylinder growth led by urban private consumption, and we believe it is not sustainable,\u201d Mr. Gruenwald said. We are maintaining our China GDP growth forecasts of 6.3% for 2016 and 6.1% for 2017. China continues to dominate discussions of the Asia-Pacific (and, at times, global) economic and financial landscape. But gone are the days when forceful, effective, and timely macroeconomic stimulus by Chinese authorities supported domestic (and global) growth and calmed global markets. \u201cMarkets have now shifted their focus to the Chinese currency markets, with the macroeconomic story relegated to a secondary plot,\u201d Mr. Gruenwald said. We have lowered our Japan 2016 GDP growth forecast to 0.8% (from 1.1%) due to a weak finish in 2015 and have kept our 2017 forecast of 0.4% unchanged. This will be a tough year for the Bank of Japan\u2019s reflation program. Monetary conditions are tighter than desired, mainly because of Japan\u2019s safe-haven status in the markets, which leads to a strong yen. The task for other Asia-Pacific economies will be to ensure that flexible markets and sound policies will help them to adjust successfully to China\u2019s new growth drivers. One of the countries to watch for a successful response to China\u2019s rebalancing is Australia. We think that all of the pieces to make this happen are in place--including exchange rate and factor market flexibility, strong government, and nimble financing--but it may take time. We see growth of 2.5%-3% over the next few years, but will be monitoring the composition of investment and exports away from the mining sector. Finally, it is unlikely that the rest of the world will come to the rescue. Reform looks like the only path to higher growth for Asia-Pacific. Falling consumer confidence does not seem to have had much impact on eurozone retail sales, said Bert Colijn of ING Bank, thanks to low inflation and higher disposable income: The worthless start of the year for financial markets still has not impacted consumption in the Eurozone much, as retail trade increased with 0.2% month-on-month and 2.4% year-on-year. This surprised analysts as they had expected retail sales to have remained stable in February. This is the highest reading of retail sales since February 2008, which was the pre-crisis peak. Even though Eurozone consumers are wary of the global economic and political situation, the sharp downturn in consumer confidence over the past months is not yet having much of an impact on retail trade. Negative inflation has been enticing to consumers and stores are profiting. Besides that, the unemployment rate continued to decline in February, which is helping disposable income grow. The months ahead could still be bleaker though as the labour market has lost a bit of its momentum in the first months of the year and today\u2019s Eurozone service sector PMI indicated a slowdown of growth in March. This means that some weakness could still be ahead of us, but the current pace of sales growth is a good sign for the overall performance of the Eurozone economy in the first quarter. Retail sales in the eurozone rose by 0.2% month on month in February and 2.4% year on year, better than analysts had been forecasting. According to a Reuters poll, the month on month figure was expected to be flat and the annual rise 1.9%. Growing demand in France and Spain helped offset a fall in Germany, according to the EU statistics office Eurostat. Sales in Germany fell 0.4% month on month after a 0.1% dip in January. But sales in France rose 0.6% and 0.2% in Spain. Back with the day\u2019s eurozone data, and RBC Capital Markets says it was a mixed picture, particularly for Spain and Italy: An improvement in the headline composite PMI reading for both Spain and Italy disguises a more mixed picture from the details. For Spain, an improvement in the services sector suggests that domestic activity remains relatively resilient in the face of its political paralysis but the Italian services reading points to a worrying slowing in the rate of domestic expansion even if a stronger manufacturing reading compensated this month. Overall, the euro area reading was revised down to 53.1 from the flash of 53.7 leaving it broadly unchanged since February. Taken together, the PMIs are still pointing to growth of 0.4% in the first quarter although we would note that they did somewhat overstate the pace of the recovery the previous quarter. Of equal concern will be the continuing weakness of both input and output prices which remain in negative territory. The uncertainty over the EU referendum is a major reason for the UK economy losing momentum, says James Knightley at ING Bank: The UK\u2019s service sector purchasing managers\u2019 index has risen a fraction more than expected to stand at 53.7 in March versus 52.7 in February (consensus was 53.5). With the manufacturing and construction PMIs remaining little changed (but at least staying in growth territory) the overall composite index has risen to 53.6 from 52.7. This is still well down on the average level of 2015 and suggests that the UK economy has lost momentum at the start of the year. An obvious factor behind this is the upcoming referendum on the UK\u2019s ongoing membership of the European Union. With opinion polls suggesting that the vote will be incredibly close, businesses are likely to act cautiously and not embark on any significant expansion plans until the economic outlook is clearer. This means that investment and labour hiring plans will be more limited, which is something that was also highlighted in the recent Deloitte CFO survey. As such, the economy looks set to post slower growth in the second quarter of 2016 than in first quarter. Should the UK vote to remain within the EU then we suggest that the slowdown will be temporary and the delayed hiring and investment plans will be re\u2014instated, leading to a decent bounce in activity in the second half of 2016. However, should the UK vote to leave then expansion plans are likely to be cancelled, business and consumer sentiment will take a hit and the Bank of England would likely have to step in with policy stimulus to try and shore-up confidence. Still, it was at least growth: The PMI figures seem to suggest a UK interest rate rise is indeed some way off. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: An upturn in the pace of service sector growth in March was insufficient to prevent the PMI surveys from collectively indicating a slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter. The surveys point to a 0.4% increase in GDP, down from 0.6% in the closing quarter of last year. Across the three main sectors of the economy, firms reported the smallest increase in demand for just over three years, which in turn fed through to a reluctance to take on new staff. March saw the weakest rate of job creation for over two-and-a-half years. Business confidence remains in the doldrums as concerns about the global economy continue to be exacerbated by uncertainty at home, with nerves unsettled by issues such as Brexit and the prospect of further government spending cuts announced in the Budget. It therefore seems unlikely that March\u2019s upturn in the pace of growth represents the start of a longer term upswing. In contrast, the survey data suggest growth is more likely to weaken further in the second quarter. With the PMI already in territory traditionally associated with the Bank of England choosing to loosen policy, interest rate hikes seem a long way off. Commenting on the PMIs, Markit said: UK service sector growth remained sluggish in March, according to the latest PMI survey data from Markit and CIPS. Total activity increased at a slightly faster rate than in February, but on a quarterly basis growth over the first three months of 2016 was the weakest since the first quarter of 2013. Moreover, incoming new business increased at the slowest rate since January 2013. Global economic uncertainty and the upcoming EU membership referendum were commonly reported to be factors undermining service sector business expectations during the month. Employment in the sector continued to rise, but at a rate little-changed from February\u2019s recent low. The latest survey data did signal a rise in inflationary pressures, particularly for charges which increased at the fastest rate in over two years. Markit says the UK has seen the weakest quarter of output growth for three years: Worries about the global economy, as well as the prospect of leaving the European Union, have helped to hold back the UK service sector. The Markit survey for March shows only a slight recovery after the index reached its lowest level in three years in February. The March eurozone PMIs could knock back forecasts for the region\u2019s growth this year, said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: A setback to hopes that the Eurozone economy may just be starting to improve after a dreary start to 2016 as the March services purchasing managers index was revised down markedly to be at a 14-month low This meant that overall Eurozone services and manufacturing activity could only edge up in March from the 13-month low suffered in February. The downward revision to the March services PMI fuels concern that Eurozone GDP growth in the first quarter of 2016 was no better than the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter rate seen in both the fourth and third quarters of 2015. Indeed, the composite PMI manufacturing and services output index for the Eurozone dipped to 53.2 in the first quarter of 2016 from 54.1 in the fourth quarter of 2015; this was the lowest quarterly average since the fourth quarter of 2014. However, it should be borne in mind that January hard data for industrial production and retail sales were healthy. Specifically, industrial production jumped 2.1% month on month and 2.8% year on year in January while there was also relatively solid retail sales volume growth of 0.4% month on month and 2.0% year on year in January On balance, we still believe that the Eurozone can achieve GDP growth of 1.6% in 2016, which would match the 2015 outturn. However, the risks to this forecast are clearly slanted to the downside. The market slide is accelerating, with the oil price falling further and the Dax hit particularly hard by the poor factory orders data from Germany. The disappointing service sector data is also hitting sentiment, as well as the downbeat comments from the IMF, with Christine Lagarde warning of risks to the global economy. The FTSE 100 is now down 1.2% while the Dax has dropped just over 2%. France\u2019s Cac is 1.7% lower. Meanwhile Brent crude is 0.7% lower at $37.43 a barrel. The final reading for the eurozone services PMI has shown a dip from the previous month, and is lower than the initial readings suggested. The Markit index came in a 53.1 for March, down from 53.3 in February and lower than the first estimate of 54. The composite index for the eurozone - manufacturing and services - came in at 53.1, up from 53 in February but lower than the initial reading of 53.7. Markit said: March saw the rate of economic expansion in the euro area improve for the first time in three months. The extent of the acceleration was negligible, however, and less marked than that indicated by earlier flash data. Manufacturing saw faster growth of production, but this was mostly offset by a slower rate of output expansion at service providers. Markit said the downward revision to the initial composite reading was mainly driven by France and Italy, which between them accounted for 0.5 points of the 0.6 fall. Germany\u2019s services PMI has also come in below expectations. The index came in at 55.1 in March, down from 55.3 in the previous month and below expectations of a rise to 55.5. The composite index is at an eight month low. Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said: The German service sector continued to expand at a solid pace at the end of the first quarter, although activity and new order inflows both increased at weaker rates. Moreover, a closer look at the sub- indices highlights some concerns that growth may slow further in coming months. In detail, the amount of work in the pipeline rose only marginally and companies took a more cautious approach with regards to hiring policies, with the rate of job creation the weakest since last July. Meanwhile, input costs faced by service providers rose at the slowest pace for more than six years, as the low interest rate environment continued to exert downward pressure on inflation. Elsewhere Italy also saw a slowdown in service sector growth: And also in the composite PMI: The French service sector has failed to improve as much as expected in March. The Markit survey shows the services PMI still below 50, a sign of contraction, against expectations of a figure of 51.2: The composite index - manufacturing and services - did hit 50, however, up from 49.3 in February and reaching a two month high. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, said: March PMI data round off a broadly flat performance of the French service sector on average over the first quarter. There remains little sign of the stagnancy lifting \u2013 although business expectations rose to the highest since last August they remain subdued in historical terms. Competitive pressures saw another round of output price cutting as firms competed for new business, underlining the challenging environment. There are also positive service sector figures from Spain, according to Markit. It said: Growth in the Spanish service sector quickened at the end of the first quarter of the year, with both activity and new orders rising at the fastest rates in four months. An increase in outstanding business was also recorded, and higher workloads encouraged further job creation. The rate of input cost inflation remained relatively weak, but companies raised their output prices for the first time since last October. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the report said: The pick-up in service sector growth in March is something of a relief following a slowdown in previous months, and suggests that the Spanish economy was able to maintain forward momentum during the first quarter of the year. Elsewhere, while output prices were raised for the first time in five months, there is still little evidence of any meaningful inflationary pressure returning to the sector. The yen has hit a 17 month high against the dollar, prompting talk of possible intervention: The yen has been boosted by its status as a haven for investors as equities fall back and commodity prices slide. Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura, told Reuters: Clearly risk sentiment is not good and oil prices are declining this week and all these feeding and driving the dollar lower against the yen. The yen is also higher against other currencies. Of course, the Bank of Japan will be concerned not just about the rise in the yen, but also a drop in stock prices. So we may see some comments from the authorities there, but actual intervention is unlikely until dollar drops below 110 yen. The Irish service sector expanded more quickly in March, according to Markit. Philip O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland said: The latest Investec Services PMI Ireland report shows a slight quickening in the rate of growth of business activity, with the headline PMI improving to 62.8 in March from the previous month\u2019s 62.1 reading. This improvement was in spite of a softening in New Orders (to a five month low, albeit it is still in growth territory), while New Export Orders eased to their slowest pace of growth since May 2012. On the latter, while panellists indicated that the UK remained a source of new business, there were suggestions that the recent strengthening of the euro against sterling had weighed on growth of new business. Another warning from the IMF on the global economy, from managing director Christine Lagarde. Katie Allen writes: Governments must urgently pursue more growth-friendly policies to shore up a weakening global economy beset with risks, the head of the International Monetary Fund has said. Christine Lagarde also put governments on alert that they should prepare contingency plans in case threats to the fragile global economy materialise. \u201cThe good news is that the recovery continues. We have growth. We are not in a crisis. The not-so-good news is that the recovery remains too slow, too fragile, and risks to its durability are increasing,\u201d Lagarde said in a lecture at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. \u201cWe are on alert, not alarm. There has been a loss of growth momentum. However, if policymakers can confront the challenges and act together, the positive effects on global confidence, and the global economy, will be substantial,\u201d she said, according to text of her speech. The full story is here: With metal prices and oil falling back, it\u2019s no surprise that commodity companies are among the biggest losers so far. The top fallers in the FTSE 100 are: Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: London\u2019s FTSE-100 has started the session with some notable losses as tumbling commodity prices find themselves back at the top of the agenda. Hopes may have been building that we would see another leg higher emerge for the asset class, but yesterday saw the Dow Jones Non Ferrous Metals Index slump almost 5% and WTI crude is eyeing a move back below $35/barrel, too. As a result it\u2019s the natural resources stocks that are scattered across the foot of the index in early trade, with Royal Dutch Shell and BP also being dragged very much into the fray. Interest rate watch: the Reserve Bank of Australia left rates unchanged at 2% as expected, while the Reserve Bank of India cut its main interest rate by 0.25% to 6.5%. As forecast, stock markets in Europe have followed their Asian counterparts with sharp falls in early trading. The FTSE 100 is down 61 points or 1%, while Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 1.8% after the poor factory order figures and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 1.4%, while Spain\u2019s Ibex is 1.3% lower. The IMF is also concerned about the insurance sector: Across advanced economies the contribution of life insurers to systemic risk has increased in recent years, although it clearly remains below that of banks. This increase is largely due to growing common exposures to aggregate risk, caused partly by a rise in insurers\u2019 interest rate sensitivity. Thus, in the event of an adverse shock, insurers are unlikely to fulfill their role as financial intermediaries precisely when other parts of the financial system are failing to do so as well. The higher common exposures do not seem to be driven by marked changes in insurers\u2019 investment portfolios, although smaller and weaker insurers in some countries have taken on more risk. The findings suggest that supervisors and regulators should take a more macroprudential approach to the sector. Doing so is necessary if supervision is to go beyond guarding against the solvency and contagion risks of individ- ual firms and take on the systemic risk arising from common exposures. Steps that would complement a push for stronger macroprudential policies include the international adoption of capital and transparency standards for the sector. In addition, the different behavior of smaller and weaker insurers warrants attention by supervisors. Policymakers need to act to prevent problems in emerging markets threatening global stability, the IMF has said. In excerpts from its latest financial stability report the fund said: The financial integration of emerging market economies into the global economy has affected international financial markets in both desirable ways\u2014more efficient asset prices and resource allocation\u2014and undesirable ones\u2014amplification of shocks and transmission of excess financial volatility... The significant growth in global capital flows due to mutual fund investments is also affecting the nature and size of financial spillovers from emerging market economies. The decision by mutual funds to sell investments in multiple countries in response to losses in one or more countries, or because of withdrawals by their own investors, is called the portfolio channel of contagion. This channel has gained in importance as a source of financial spillovers from emerging market economies to equity markets in recent years, in line with the increase in asset allocation to these countries. The impact from the portfolio channel from advanced economies remains significantly larger, according to the IMF. The IMF says the influence of China will grow as it becomes more integrated into the global financial system: The IMF research shows that among large emerging market economies, China is unique: news about its economic growth has an economically significant and rising impact on global equity prices. In the last five years alone, the impact of growth surprises from China on global equity prices has almost quadrupled. By contrast, changes in Chinese asset prices tend to have little effect on asset prices elsewhere. \u201cPurely financial spillovers from China are still very small, but likely to grow considerably as China gradually continues to integrate into the global financial system,\u201d said Gaston Gelos, head of the Global Financial Stability Analysis Division at the IMF. So policymakers need to act to safeguard financial stability in the wake of the growing importance of emerging markets: \u201cThe evidence underscores the need for policymakers to take into account economic and policy developments in emerging market economies when assessing their own countries\u2019 prospects,\u201d said Gelos. Enhanced international economic and macroprudential policy cooperation can also play an important role. Other policy measures countries need to implement include: \u2022 In emerging market economies, policymakers can foster the development of a domestic investor base to help dampen the effect of international financial contagion. \u2022 As China\u2019s role in the global financial system continues to grow, policymakers will need clear and timely communication of policy decisions, transparency about policy goals, and strategies to achieve them. \u2022 The amplification of emerging markets\u2019 financial impact on other countries due to corporate debt means policymakers should adopt measures to limit excessive increases in corporate debt that could threaten financial stability. Improving rules to limit systemic risks arising from mutual funds also remains important. \u2022 Lastly, improving data on cross-border financial flows intermediated by banks, investment funds, and large institutional investors is a priority. German factory orders fell unexpectedly in February, according to figures from the economy ministry, hit by a decline in overseas demand. They dropped 1.2%, the biggest monthly fall in six months and well below expectations of a 0.2% rise. Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said: German new orders dropped sharply in February, adding to evidence of continued stagnation in the German industry. New orders declined by 1.2% month on month, from an upwardly revised increase of 0.5% month on month in January. On the year, new orders were up by 0.5%. The last months have not been easy for the German industry. Since May last year, new orders have dropped in six out of ten months. Interestingly, the February drop was driven by falling foreign demand (-2.7% month on month), whole domestic demand picked up somewhat after a two-months slump. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets and business. Stock markets are under pressure again as the International Monetary Fund warned of the knock on effect from growing problems in emerging markets, and oil prices slipped again. Brent crude is down 0.3% at $37.57 a barrel, as hopes of a deal to curb production at this month\u2019s planned meeting of producers continue to fade. The Nikkei 225 is down 2.4%, while the Hang Seng is 1.4% lower. European markets are expected to open lower: Investors will be keen to see the results of the latest services PMI data from Europe and the UK. There was an improvement in the initial March estimates from France, up from 49.2 to 51.2, the best figures since before the Paris terror attacks last year. Expectations are for the final data to show an improvement, with better numbers also forecast for Spain, Italy and Germany. However the recent attacks in Brussels could well have had an effect on sentiment. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Since these previous readings the Brussels terror attacks could well had an impact on sentiment, particularly in the travel and hotel sector, which has driven a lot of the improvement in the French numbers. There is a fear that events in Brussels could well have knocked confidence in a sector that appeared to be on the cusp of a fragile recovery. Today\u2019s numbers could well be the first test of that sentiment. In the UK, analysts will look for any signs that the recent Brexit headlines have hit sentiment. Hewson said: Last month we saw the sector post its weakest reading since April 2013 at 52.7. Was this merely a blip or evidence of an element of caution as we head towards the summer vote? Expectations are for a decent end to the first quarter with an improvement to 54, from February\u2019s 52.7.",

                "bodyText":"The final scores in Europe showed some reasonable gains in the wake of the oil price rise, itself fuelled by the bigger than expected fall in US crude stocks. A boost to pharmaceutical stocks also helped matters, as investors bet that Pfizer would turn its attention to another target following the collapse of its $160bn deal to buy Allergan. The closing figures for Europe were: The FTSE 100 finished 70.40 points or 1.16% higher at 6161.63 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.64% to 9624.51 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.81% to 4284.64 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.77% to 17,240.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.13% at 8398.6 In Greece, the Athens market bucked the trend, slipping 1.27% to 554.12 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 70 points or 0.4%. On oil, Chris Beauchamp of IG said: The positive sheen on stock markets this afternoon would likely have been more of a thin veneer had it not been for a surge in oil prices thanks to the first fall in US stockpiles in two months. More of this is needed however to convert the still robust community of oil bears that expect further declines. West Texas is up 5.1% at the moment to $37.74 a barrel, while Brent crude is 5.2% higher at $39.84. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The oil price rise has energised markets which were threatening to drift in an uncertain fashion towards the close of trading. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: It\u2019s been a decent session for London\u2019s FTSE-100 with the blue chip index seeing gains accelerate into the close. A large fall in the US crude inventory data is certainly helping bolster sentiment with WTI oil lining up for another go at the $40 a barrel mark and as we keep noting this asset really does seem to be driving momentum for the market as a whole. West Texas Intermediate - the US crude benchmark - is currently up 4.8% at $37.62 while Brent crude is 4.2% better at $39.47. Back with the news that Pfizer and Allergan have called off their merger, and the collapse has been welcomed by the Democratic frontrunner in the US election: Brent crude, which was up around 1.8% before the release of the US crude figures, is now up 2.85% at $38.85 a barrel. David Morrison at Spreadco said: Crude was already in positive territory for the day with WTI and Brent climbing back above their technically-significant levels of $36 and $38 per barrel respectively. This push higher began late yesterday and bucked the downward trend that\u2019s been in place since mid-March. The sell-off over the last few weeks is a reaction to the dysfunction apparent within OPEC ahead of the planned meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to freeze output. Suggestions from Kuwait that there would be a positive announcement on a production freeze at this month\u2019s meeting was partly behind the strength in the oil price earlier in the day. Here is Reuters on the drop in US crude inventories: U.S. crude stocks unexpectedly fell from record highs last week as refineries continued to hike output and imports fell, while gasoline stocks rose, snapping a six-week decline, data from the Energy Information Administration showed on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 4.9 million barrels in the last week, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations for an increase of 3.2 million barrels.... Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 357,000 barrels, EIA said. Refinery crude runs, which have remained at record seasonal levels for most of this year thanks to unusually strong gasoline margins, rose by 199,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates rose by 1 percentage point, although usage may ebb with more maintenance expected throughout this month. Gasoline stocks, which swelled this winter to record highs and remain at unusually high levels for this time of year, rose by 1.4 million barrels after six consecutive declines, compared with expectations for a 1.0 million barrels drop. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 1.8 million barrels, versus expectations for a 333,000 barrels drop, the EIA data showed. U.S. crude imports fell last week by 446,000 barrels per day. Here is the notification on the crude move from the Energy Information Administration: A surprise weekly drop in US crude stocks has pushed oil prices even higher. It\u2019s become rather a mixed bag as far as markets are concerned, as Europe heads towards the close of trading. The FTSE 100 is holding onto its gains, up 20 points or 0.3%, but Germany\u2019s Dax is marginally in the red while France\u2019s Cac has managed to edge higher. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost its early gains and is now 49 points or 0.28% lower, ahead of the minutes of last month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Whilst the FTSE held into its oil- and pharma-inspired gains the picture was far more mixed across the rest of the market. The Dow Jones [has slipped], a lack of data and hesitation ahead of this evening\u2019s Fed meeting minutes suppressing the appetite of US investors. It will be interesting to see what is uncovered with the latest insight into the inner workings of the central bank. Reports of discord between a dovish Yellen and the FOMC\u2019s more hawkish members have only grown in the past few weeks, and investors will likely be keen to see what kind of rhetoric was used by both sides in March\u2019s meeting, especially if it helps provide an idea of when the balance might shift in favour of those supporting a rate hike. The FTSE, meanwhile, managed to outperform the rest of the major global indices... thanks to two of its key sectors. Firstly Brent Crude\u2019s $39 per barrel-pushing rebound helped to instil the semblance of stability in the oil stocks (even if their mining peers have been dragged down by a one month low-showing from copper). Secondly the likes of AstraZeneca and Shire saw unexpected growth as the day continued, the fallout from the failed Pfizer/Allergan merger causing many to speculate that the former might be go shopping again to satisfy its M&amp;A-thirst. More detail of the state of the US job market has just been issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report says: Unemployment rates were lower in February than a year earlier in 296 of the 387 metropolitan areas, higher in 76 areas, and unchanged in 15 areas, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Eleven areas had jobless rates of less than 3.0 percent and 11 areas had rates of at least 10.0 percent. Nonfarm payroll employment increased over the year in 323 metropolitan areas, decreased in 62 areas, and was unchanged in 2 areas. The national unemployment rate in February was 5.2 percent, not seasonally adjusted, down from 5.8 percent a year earlier. In its latest pronouncement ahead of its meeting next week, the International Monetary Fund has called for labour markets to be reformed to boost jobs. Larry Elliott writes: The protracted weakness of the global economy has highlighted the need for lower taxes on employment and higher public spending to get the unemployed back into work, the International Monetary Fund has said. Expressing concern about sluggish growth in the west since the 2008-09 downturn, the Washington-based IMF said it was time for ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing to be accompanied by a range of structural reforms. The IMF issued its advice in a chapter from the half-yearly World Economic Outlook (WEO) released before the report\u2019s publication next week. Romain Duval and Davide Furceri, economists from the IMF\u2019s research department, said: \u201cIn the current environment of persistent weak economic activity in many advanced economies, there is a strong case for product and labour market reforms, complemented by macroeconomic policy support, to boost jobs and growth.\u201d The chapter from the WEO said an example of product market reform would be to make it easier for new firms to break into markets such as retailing and professional services. Labour market reforms included higher public spending to help the jobless find work, cutting unemployment benefits to encourage the jobless to take low-paid work, cutting taxes on employment, and making it easier for employers to hire and fire full-time staff. The full story is here: As the oil price continues to rise, buoyed by hopes of production freezes after comments from Kuwait, US markets are edging higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up while the S&amp;P 500 is 0.09% higher and Nasdaq has added 0.17%. And after falling 15% on Tuesday on talk that its takeover by Pfizer would fall through, Allergan has recovered slightly, up 0.5% at the open. Here\u2019s our latest report on the collapse of the Pfizer and Allergan deal: The world\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical deal was called off on Wednesday when Pfizer and Allergan responded to changes in the US tax regime by abandoning their $160bn merger. In what will be regarded as a victory for the US president, Barack Obama, in his drive to clamp down on tax avoiding deals, Pfizer \u2013 best known for Viagra and its cholesterol pill Lipitor \u2013 will now pay the Botox producer Allergan $150m for pulling out of the deal. The transaction was first announced in November and is the second major deal Pfizer has attempted that has collapsed in two years after it failed to clinch a \u00a370bn takeover of the British drugmaker AstraZeneca in 2014. There was immediate speculation that Pfizer might again turn its attentions to a UK-listed company, with shares in Shire and AstraZeneca each rising by about 3% to lead the FTSE 100 higher. Both Pfizer and Allergan set out their credentials to remain standalone entities, though Pfizer\u2019s chief executive, Ian Read, said a possible division into two parts \u2013 one focused on patented-protected innovative drugs and the other on older products that have come off patent or are close to it \u2013 was still on the table. \u201cWe plan to make a decision about whether to pursue a potential separation of our innovative and established businesses by no later than the end of 2016, consistent with our original timeframe for the decision prior to the announcement of the potential Allergan transaction,\u201d Read said. The full story is here: Most of Europe\u2019s main markets are still up: The pound is down against the dollar and the euro on renewed fears over what an exit from then EU would mean for the UK economy. Sterling fell 0.6% to a near two-year low of 80.85 pence against the euro. It hit a five-week low against the dollar, down 1% at $1.4025. The pound was also down against a basket of currencies at the lowest level since December 2013. The falls came as the latest poll on the EU referendum showed 43% of voters wanted to leave, while 44% were opposed to Brexit. Peter Frank, currency strategist at BBVA: The closeness of opinion polls means that there is a large risk that Brexit could happen. This scenario risks a huge slide in sterling. Foreign direct investment and portfolio flows are needed to recycle the UK\u2019s record trade and current account deficits. A Brexit vote ... could halt such sterling supportive net capital inflows. The FTSE 100 continues to make gains on the back of the collapsed $160bn deal between Viagra-maker Pfizer and Botox-producing Allergan. The index is up 0.7% or 42 points at 6,133, with pharmaceutical companies Shire and AstraZeneca at the top of the leader board, up by 3.7% and 3.4% respectively. Investors appear to be betting that now the deal has collapsed, UK pharma companies might be back on the shopping list. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG: The possibility now is that Pfizer goes shopping again, and you might be prepared to develop a case that maybe a firm like Shire becomes the bid target. The implications of the new [US tax inversion] rules would have to be worked out, but if you\u2019ve got cash sloshing around the sector, people are wondering who will benefit. Allergan\u2019s full statement on the collapse of the Pfizer deal can be found here. The company said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the deal would no longer happen, but argued it still had a strong future as a standalone company. Brent Saunders, chief executive and president: While we are disappointed that the Pfizer transaction will no longer move forward, Allergan is poised to deliver strong, sustainable growth built on a set of powerful attributes. Leading therapeutic franchises with strong brands across seven therapeutic areas provide the foundation for continued strong growth in 2016 and beyond. Our pipeline is one of the strongest in the industry, loaded with 70 mid-to-late stage programs including 14 expected approvals and 16 regulatory submissions in 2016 alone,\u201d Pfizer has officially confirmed that it is walking away from its proposed $160bn deal with Ireland-based Allergan. It follows moves by US President Barack Obama to clamp down on so-called tax inversion deals, where companies relocate their headquarters in order to benefit from lower tax rates. Pfizer said the deal was terminated by \u201cmutual agreement\u201d. It will pay Allergan a break fee of $150m (\u00a3106m). Pfizer said it was pulling out as a result of the proposed changes in the US, which it judged to be an \u201cadverse tax law change\u201d. Ian Read, Pfizer\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said: Pfizer approached this transaction from a position of strength and viewed the potential combination as an accelerator of existing strategies. We remain focused on continuing to enhance the value of our innovative and established businesses. Our most recent product launches, including Prevnar 13 in Adults, Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz, have been well-received in the market, and we believe our late stage pipeline has several attractive commercial opportunities with high potential across several therapeutic areas. We also maintain the financial strength and flexibility to pursue attractive business development and other shareholder friendly capital allocation opportunities. We plan to make a decision about whether to pursue a potential separation of our innovative and established businesses by no later than the end of 2016, consistent with our original timeframe for the decision prior to the announcement of the potential Allergan transaction. As always, we remain committed to enhancing shareholder value. Read the full statement here. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence has published a report on what impact share price falls in the first quarter have had on the market value of Europe\u2019s top banks. HSBC held on to the top spot despite a near 19% fall in value over the first quarter. S&amp;P notes: HSBC Holdings Plc remains atop the ranking, but with its shares down nearly 19% in the first quarter, its market capitalisation expressed in terms of euros is no longer more than double that of runner-up Lloyds Banking Group Plc. Deutsche Bank AG dropped to 20th by market capitalisation from 14th three months earlier, having seen its shares fall by one-third during the first quarter. PAO Sberbank of Russia rose five spots to 12th, while Allied Irish Banks Plc returned to the top 20 by rising 11 places from 26th. KBC Group NV, Standard Chartered Plc and UniCredit SpA dropped out of the top 20 during the quarter. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP whose Aberavon constituency is home to Tata\u2019s Port Talbot plant has been speaking of his hopes that a deal can be done to save the steel plant. This from Guardian reporter Sean Farrell: Losses at Tata Steel have halved from the previously reported \u00a31m a day, giving weight to management\u2019s claims that it can turn the business around, the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said. Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency is home to Tata\u2019s Port Talbot plant, said the government should not rush into backing the wrong deal for the business,which Tata put up for sale last week. He welcomed the interest of metals magnate Sanjeev Gupta in a possible rescue plan but was doubtful about Gupta\u2019s proposal to replace Port Talbot\u2019s giant steelmaking blast furnace with an operation built around recycling scrap steel. Kinnock has been a fierce critic of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis at Tata Steel, which employs 15,000 people including about 4,000 at the Port Talbot plant in south Wales. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, arrived in Mumbai on Wednesday to meet Tata\u2019s bosses a week after Kinnock travelled to the city to lobby the Indian conglomerate when Javid was on a trip to Australia. Javid is now trying to help broker a purchase of the business, possibly with government support for the buyer. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Today programme, Kinnock said: \u201cIt\u2019s very good that Sajid Javid has finally found his way to Mumbai. The proposals Mr Gupta has outlined are very interesting indeed. I\u2019m going to be meeting with him very soon \u2026 But there are quite interesting ideas bubbling under and we need to make sure we don\u2019t rush to something because the government is in such a shambles.\u201d Read the full story here. European markets continue to rise, with the FTSE 100 up 0.5% at 6,122.42. The index of leading UK shares is being boosted by some upbeat news from China and a rebounding oil price (Brent crude oil is currently up 2.3% at $38.73 a barrel). But it is also benefitting from the expectation that Pfizer is about to walk away from its $160bn merger with Allergan. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, explains: A jump in the price of oil and surprisingly positive service sector data from China has helped lift European shares off three-week lows on Wednesday. Reports that the Allergan-Pfizer merger has been terminated has counter-intuitively sparked buying in other UK and Irish pharmaceutical groups. Speculation that Pfizer will look for another partner in its quest to relocate its headquarters and lower its tax burden has sent the shares of Shire and AstraZeneca flying. Best selling cars in the UK in March: Ford Fiesta Vauxhall Corsa Ford Focus Volkswagen Golf Nissan Qashqai Volkswagen Polo Vauxhall Astra Mini Fiat 500 Audi A3 Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, has issued a note of caution on UK new car sales, which have seemed unstoppable in recent years. He suggests consumer appetite will start to wane, with a knock-on effect for the wider economy. The key drivers of the recovery in car sales are weakening. Unsecured borrowing costs, while still falling, are not declining as sharply as they did in 2015. Meanwhile, consumer confidence has deteriorated this year and the intensification of the fiscal squeeze in the new fiscal year, which began this week, likely will depress sentiment further. Car sales contributed 0.3 percentage points to the 2.8% year-over-year rise in overall household spending in 2015, so this slowdown will be discernible in the headline consumption numbers. Phil Harrold, PwC\u2019s automotive leader, is much more upbeat: Today\u2019s figures reflect continuing business and consumer confidence, which will undoubtedly be boosted following the recent motor friendly budget that saw no changes to vehicle excise duty and fuel duty frozen for a sixth year. Business users continue to replenish fleets as more economical vehicles become available and consumers continue to access the very cheap finance deals that show no signs of abating. Of particular interest is the growth of alternatively fuelled vehicles as technology becomes more advanced but, more crucially, consumer acceptance levels rise. New car sales rose by 5.3% to 518,707 in March, boosted by the fact it was a plate change month. It was the best ever month since the bi-annual plate change was introduced in 1999, according to figures published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It rounded off a record quarter, with more than 770,000 new cars registered between January and March. That was a 5.1% increase compared with the same period in 2015. Consumers have been attracted by cheap car finance deals, as well as lower emission vehicles with lower running costs. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT welcomed the increase in sales but warned consumer confidence could be undermined \u201cby political or economic uncertainty\u201d. There is a 35-40% chance that the UK will vote to leave the EU on 23 June, according to analysts at IHS. They point out that it would take two years to actually exit following the referendum, but what is unknown is whether the process of Brexit would be \u201csoft\u201d or \u201chard\u201d. And this would have broader implications for the performance of the UK economy. The most favourable outcome to a vote for the United Kingdom to exit the European Union would be what IHS terms a \u201csoft\u201d exit. Under this scenario, the UK would conduct amicable and constructive negotiations with the EU resulting in full trade agreements and full UK access to the European Single Market. On the migration front, the UK would attract highly skilled workers, perhaps through the adoption of a points system as used by Australia. A reduction in the number of less skilled workers coming into the country would have an upward impact on UK earnings; though, this scenario would also hurt the UK\u2019s competitiveness by putting upward pressure on unit labour costs, IHS says. Under a \u201chard\u201d exit scenario, the exit could be contentious and lengthy. The UK would struggle markedly over the short and longer term and would find itself excluded from, or having limited access to, the European Single Market. With the UK having limited access to the European Single Market and struggling for trade agreements, there would be significantly lower levels of new foreign direct investment. The City of London\u2019s position would be compromised and it would lose appreciable business to Frankfurt and Paris. Finally, under this scenario, the UK\u2019s migration policy would result in a lack of incoming workers needed for lesser-skilled jobs, and the resultant reduced workforce would limit potential UK growth. More reaction on those better than expected German industrial production numbers... Jonathan Loynes, Capital Economics: February\u2019s surprisingly small fall in German industrial production offers hope of a pick-up in GDP growth in the first quarter. But it is too early to conclude that the eurozone\u2019s main growth engine is now firing on all cylinders. Overall, an encouraging set of figures, given the importance of the German industrial sector. But with other evidence still downbeat, not least on the all-important consumer sector, there is little here to point to a broader upturn either in Germany or the currency union as a whole. Carsten Brzeski, ING: Another disappointment. German industrial production posted the expected decline in February, providing further evidence that the economy\u2019s former backbone has become weak. Only the construction sector remains an almost inexhaustible source of growth. Industrial production has become a kind of problem child over the last months. Despite tentative signs of stabilisation, industrial production has stagnated for a long while. Still, there are some tender rays of hope at the end of the tunnel: the recent drop in inventories combined with a pick up in corporate loans and capacity utilization at the highest level since end-2011 suggests that it is too early, yet, to give up on the German industry. In Germany, official figures showed industrial output fell by 0.5% in February, compared with January. While that doesn\u2019t sound like great news, it was a far better result than the 1.8% drop economists polled by Reuters were expecting. Andreas Scheuerle, economist at Dekabank, said: Looking at January and February together, the picture is looking bright. Industrial production is pointing upward. But nobody should take this as a sure-fire success for the rest of the year. The problems on global sales markets are not solved yet. Scheuerle said the data pointed to German growth of 0.5% in the first quarter. The industrial output data was also a welcome relief following shockingly poor figures for industrial orders, published on Tuesday. Orders had been expected to increase by 0.2% in February, but instead fell by 1.2%. In corporate news, the largest pharmaceuticals merger in history appears to be on the rocks. It is thought the $160bn (\u00a3113bn) deal between US giant Pfizer (best known for Viagra) and Dublin based Allergan (Botox producer) could be abandoned after the US government took new steps to clamp down on tax avoidance deals. The US Treasury proposed new rules on Monday, which would make so-called tax inversion deals - where companies relocate their headquarters to countries with a lower tax rate - less financially appealing. We will bring you official confirmation once we have it. In the meantime, read our full story on events so far here. The FTSE 100 has opened up 0.4% or 22 points at 6,113. All other major European indices have also opened higher. Oil prices rose from one-month lows as traders pinned their hopes on exporters agreeing to freeze production. US crude futures jumped by more than a dollar, or almost 3%, to a high of $36.92 a barrel. Brent crude is up 1.6% at $38.48 a barrel. Business activity in China\u2019s services sector increased in March on stronger demand, according to the latest PMI survey. The Caixin China general services PMI came in at 52.2 in March, up from 51.2 in February. Anything above 50 indicates growth. That has eased fears over the outlook in China, supporting the view that the economy is stabilising. Here is what\u2019s been happening in Asia... Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets and business. Asian investors were in a brighter mood today than their counterparts in the US and Europe yesterday. The Nikkei has closed down just 0.1% at 15,715.36, while the Hang Seng was up 0.1% at 20,203.45. That compared with sharper falls in the US and Europe on Tuesday, as investors became jittery following (another) warning from the IMF about the fragile state of the global economy, and weak eurozone data. Asian investors were encouraged by an improvement in China\u2019s services sector (more to follow), and a rebound in oil prices.",

                "bodyText":"In his statement announcing the decision to keep interest rates steady, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Glenn Stevens, took the position that when it comes to currency battles it is better to jaw-jaw than war-war. Right now it is a bit tough to gauge the \u201ccorrect\u201d value of a country\u2019s currency. The major trading powers in the world \u2013 the US, Europe, Japan and China \u2013 are all indulging in some form of aggressive monetary policy which affects the value of their currencies. Whether it be quantitative easing, negative interest rates, or the depreciation of the yuan, countries are competing against each other in a currency war to try to keep the value of theirs down in order to assist with exports. Thus far the RBA has chosen not to follow such a path \u2013 partly because unlike the US and Europe our economy didn\u2019t go into the toilet in the great recession, and also because the falling prices of iron ore, coal and oil were doing the job for it. The value of our dollar is linked to the prices of our major exports and thus a massive drop in their prices since 2012 has seen similar large falls in the Aussie. So did Stevens\u2019 words have any impact? Well the dollar did fall about half a per cent on Wednesday, though as ever in the international currency market many factors were in play \u2013 including the Japan-US currency battles. But then \u2013 because with currency markets nothing ever goes to plan \u2013 on Thursday morning it made a small rebound. But in the past few months there has been a slight improvement in the value of our major export commodities and the dollar has risen from a low of US$0.687 in January to US$0.766 last Thursday: Now we do need to keep a bit of context \u2013 after all the value remains well down on where it was throughout most of 2015. But after a nine-month run of being below US$0.75, the dollar looked set on a path to US$0.80: The clearest way the RBA could prevent this is by cutting interest rates. A lower interest rate means a lower return on money held in Australian banks in Australian dollars, thus international investors move money into another currency where they can get better returns. This reduces the demand for our dollar, and also reduces its price (in terms of other currencies such as the US dollar). But cutting the exchange rate has implications for our economy \u2013 implications that can outweigh the concerns of a high dollar. For example, the housing market has shown distinct signs of cooling off in Sydney and Melbourne. The RBA\u2019s statement on Tuesday noted: \u201cThe pace of growth in dwelling prices has moderated in Melbourne and Sydney and has remained mostly subdued in other cities.\u201d The bank would be happy with this \u2013 growth in housing prices is good, but not if it is so strong that it may lead to a bubble. And that\u2019s the problem with cutting rates to help lower the value of our dollar \u2013 it could start up the housing boom again. And so instead of cutting the RBA used words. Generally the statement issued each month by the governor of the RBA announcing the latest interest rate decision changes very little \u2013 and people like me perhaps spend far too much time pondering the differences in words. For example on the issue of inflation, in March the governor said: \u201cInflation is quite low. With growth in labour costs continuing to be quite subdued as well, and inflation restrained elsewhere in the world, inflation is likely to remain low over the next year or two.\u201d This month he said: \u201cInflation is quite low. Recent information has confirmed that growth in labour costs remains quite subdued. Given this, and with inflation also restrained elsewhere in the world, inflation in Australia is likely to remain low over the next year or two.\u201d A few changes, but there\u2019s not a lot of difference in meaning between \u201ccontinuing to be quite subdued\u201d and \u201cremains quite subdued\u201d. But this month there was a big difference in the language relating to the exchange rate. Last month there was merely a by-the-by aside that \u201cthe exchange rate has been adjusting to the evolving economic outlook\u201d. This month a new paragraph was inserted noting: \u201cThe Australian dollar has appreciated somewhat recently. In part, this reflects some increase in commodity prices, but monetary developments elsewhere in the world have also played a role. Under present circumstances, an appreciating exchange rate could complicate the adjustment under way in the economy.\u201d \u201cComplicate the adjustment\u201d is a pretty unsubtle way of Stevens alerting the world\u2019s currency traders that he won\u2019t stand by while the dollar continues to rise \u2013 especially if due to \u201cdevelopments elsewhere in the world\u201d (ie other central banks working to lower the value of their own currency). Australia\u2019s rebalancing economy currently needs a lower dollar \u2013 especially in light of the trade figures also out yesterday which showed a near record deficit: That deficit is in current dollars and thus it is not our lowest in terms of GDP, but it is still nothing to be too happy about \u2013 especially as it occurred due to exports falling by more than imports have: Surprisingly, the exports falls \u2013 at least in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 were not from the mining sector, but the rural one. In trend terms however both sectors fell. The one bright spot has been the services sector \u2013 ie mostly tourism and education \u2013 the sectors most affected by a rising dollar: So did Stevens\u2019 words have any impact? Well, the dollar did fall about half a per cent on Wednesday, though as ever with the international currency market many factors were in play \u2013 including the Japan-US currency battles. But the dollar is now 1.3% below where it was on Thursday.

                "bodyText":"Demand for loans from the World Bank has reached levels unsurpassed outside of financial crises as developing countries struggle to cope with the weakness of the global economy. Ahead of its half-yearly spring meeting in Washington later this week, the Bank said it expected to lend more than $150bn (\u00a3105bn) in the four years from 2013 \u2013 a period when global economic activity repeatedly failed to match expectations. The Bank said its growth forecast of 2.9% for 2016 already looked under threat after a deterioration in the outlook since the start of the year, adding that it was increasing its financial help to both middle-income and the least-developed countries. Those developing countries that rely heavily on exports of commodities have been hard hit over the past two years by the slowdown in China, which has led to a crash in the cost of oil and industrial metals. \u201cWe are in a global economy where growth is expected to remain weak, so it is critically important that the World Bank play our traditional role of helping developing countries accelerate growth,\u201d said Jim Yong Kim, the bank\u2019s president. \u201cWe have an historic opportunity to end extreme poverty in the world by 2030 but the only way we can achieve this goal is if developing countries \u2013 from middle-income to low-income nations \u2013 get back on the path of faster growth that helps the poorest and most vulnerable.\u201d The global crisis of 2008-09 led to a surge in World Bank lending to middle-income countries that struggled as trade flows and industrial production fell at rates similar to those in the early stages of the Great Depression. Demand for loans subsequently fell back from a peak of $44bn in 2010 to $15bn in 2013, although the Bank said it had risen to $23.5bn in 2015 and would top $25bn in 2016. The Bank also provides concessional loans to the least-developed countries through its International Development Association, financed by regular donations from western governments. Support for the poorest countries was expected to be near historic levels this year, the Bank said, adding that demand for non-lending advisory services, to help clients implement important policy changes, was also higher than ever. An important portion of current lending support has been in the form of development policy financing, which has backed important reforms client countries have been implementing to help diversify sources of growth and buffer against future shocks. \u201cThe use of these types of loans are important because the Bank is basically signalling to the financial markets that a country\u2019s reforms are technically solid, the country will follow through on these commitments, and the reforms will help and not hurt the poor and vulnerable,\u201d Kim said. He added that the financing provided by the Bank was \u201chighly complementary\u201d to the efforts of the International Monetary Fund to provide developing countries with stable macroeconomic policies. The Bank said two-thirds of global poverty reduction in the last half-century had been the result of faster growth, and that explained why it was using its financial clout to support policies in developing countries that led to a more rapid expansion in output.",

Brent is currently 3.7% higher at $44.43 a barrel, having touched $44.73, while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is up 3.1% at $41.61.

This is partly because the IMF appears to be constrained by the official, government forecasts for China and India, but its projections for the US and the euro-zone also look too optimistic.</p> <p>Among advanced economies, the key differences [between the IMF and our forecasts] are that we are less optimistic about both the US and the euro-zone. With first-quarter growth in the US now likely to be only around 1.0%, the risks to our US forecast are to the downside. And for the euro-zone, the generally disappointing first-quarter data have supported our view that activity is likely to slow this year.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40b96d8ae631f6bfafa918fe89a239e098cc717c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40b96d8ae631f6bfafa918fe89a239e098cc717c/0_0_669_436/500.jpg\" alt=\"GDP forecasts\" width=\"500\" height=\"326\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">GDP forecasts</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Among emerging economies, we think growth in China will be around 5.5%.

A vote to leave would, it says, have serious consequences not just for Britain and its EU partners but for the whole of the global economy. The Fund is twitchy. It can identify a number of different triggers that might possibly bring about a new, dangerous phase of the crisis \u2013 such as a sharper than expected slowdown in China, a collapse in emerging markets or a pandemic. But with little more than two months to go before the referendum, Brexit is the most immediate threat.</p> <p>But if the Fund is right in its assessment, something will trigger the crisis sooner or later even if Britain decides to remain a member of the EU. The IMF says global growth has been too slow for too long, and proposes a mix of expansionary monetary policy (low interest rates and quantitative easing), higher spending on infrastructure and research and development, and structural reforms to boost productivity.</p> <p>This, though, seems a bit timid if the Fund is right in its analysis that globalisation benefits the few not the many and that a rising tide no longer lifts all boats. In that case, the remedy would not be more R&amp;D spending but checks on financial speculation and more aggressive redistribution. Global growth has indeed been too slow for too long.

Despite the positive face put on by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who emerged in the early hours to say that progress had been made, there is no hiding the divide that still exists between Athens and the foreign lenders keeping the country afloat.</p> <p>As the straight-talking Oxford-educated finance minister himself admitted:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cbecause there are many other small [issues] we did not have the time to discuss it became obvious to all of us that it was not possible to have a staff level agreement by day break today.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Disagreement over non performing loans and pension reforms still linger but beyond discord over Athens\u2019 ability to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % by 2018, it is the much bigger disagreement over debt relief that has come to cloud the talks. The inability of Berlin and the International Monetary Fund to see eye-to-eye on the matter is unlikely to be resolved soon.</p> <p>Even if Greek officials manage to put the final touches to a deal that would effectively conclude the process later this week at the IMF\u2019s spring meetings in Washington DC, in Athens almost no one believes in a similar breakthrough on the crucial issue of debt relief. Without debt forgiveness, few have faith in the shattered Greek economy ever recovering. While the IMF continues to advocate a debt haircut, EU member states led by Berlin have hinted that, at most, a reduction would come in the form of longer maturities and grace periods.</p> <p>In private, leading members of the leftist led government are holding out the hope that Europe\u2019s refugee emergency \u2013 and Greece\u2019s frontline role \u2013 will help cut it some slack.</p> <p>\u201cBut that line of thought could backfire in so many ways,\u201d says Aristides Hatzis, associate professor of law and economics at the University of Athens.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFirst of all from the far right that will exploit anti-immigrant sentiment while the trade off of less reforms for more refugees will, quite rightly, never be accepted by the IMF.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>If the talks aren\u2019t concluded by May, Greece, will, once again, face a ferocious liquidity problem just when it confronts \u20ac5bn worth of debt repayments in June and July (money it does not have) and the UK is gearing up for its in-out EU referendum. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YiannisMouzakis/status/719840789648375809\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a>&#39;s 2016 debt obligations <a href=\"https://t.co/uqXMoeoCr4\">pic.twitter.com/uqXMoeoCr4</a></p>&mdash; Yiannis Mouzakis (@YiannisMouzakis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YiannisMouzakis/status/719840789648375809\">April 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-12T11:33:00.264Z\">at 12.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-570cd444e4b00591e8dc8a62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-12T10:58:16.399Z\">11.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newsflash: Saudi Arabia\u2019s credit rating has just been cut by one notch, to AA-, by Fitch.</strong></p> <p>Fitch also left Saudi Arabia with a negative outlook, meaning further cuts are possible.</p> <p>It cited the \u201cnegative implications\u201d of cheaper oil on the country\u2019s fiscal stability, and also pointed to rising tensions with Iran.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/business/status/719840841905369089\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Saudi Arabia ratings cut by Fitch, which says outlook remains negative <a href=\"https://t.co/wx9kCQwAFW\">https://t.co/wx9kCQwAFW</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hdRW81pEih\">pic.twitter.com/hdRW81pEih</a></p>&mdash; Bloomberg (@business) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/business/status/719840841905369089\">April 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-570cd146e4b00591e8dc8a58\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-12T10:53:32.955Z\">11.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB's Weidmann defends Draghi</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"07d0814dc6fa3858edb9825faaa43df5d379043c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07d0814dc6fa3858edb9825faaa43df5d379043c/0_0_3500_1730/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The President of the Deutsche Bundesbank (German Central Bank) Jens Weidmann.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"494\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Has peace broken out at the European Central Bank, between president Mario Draghi and his more hawkish colleague Jens Weidmann?</strong></p> <p>Weidmann, who heads up Germany\u2019s central bank, has leapt to Draghi\u2019s defence against critics - including many Germans \u2013 who oppose his monetary easing and record low interest rates.</p> <p>Speaking to the Financial Times, Weidmann argues (persuasively) that it\u2019s too simplistic to just talk about \u2018savers\u2019 suffering from low borrowing costs.

                "bodyText":"A jump in the oil price has fuelled a rise in European markets, which had previously been looking rather uncertain. Hopes of an agreement at the imminent meeting of oil producers in Doha, specifically suggestions that Russia and Saudi Arabia had agreed a freeze, sent crude prices to new highs for the year. Brent is currently 3.7% higher at $44.43 a barrel, having touched $44.73, while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is up 3.1% at $41.61. Oil has also been lifted by the weakness in the dollar, as investors bet there would not be an imminent rise in US interest rates. Meanwhile, optimism that the Chinese economy may be stabilising helped other commodities and pushed mining shares higher. The gloomy news from the International Monetary Fund, which cut its global growth forecasts, was pushed to one side. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 42.27 points or 0.68% at 6242.39 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.81% to 9761.47 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.77% to 4345.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.57% higher at 8546.3 But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB bucked the trend, falling 1.57% to 17,444.80 as the country\u2019s banks slipped back after recent gains on confirmation of a plan to restructure bad loans In Greece, the Athens market dipped 1.34% to 553.43 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 157 points or 0.9% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The IMF\u2019s growth forecasts still look too optimistic even though they have been downgraded, says Capital Economics: Despite being revised down yet again, we think the IMF\u2019s latest projections for global growth are still too high. This is partly because the IMF appears to be constrained by the official, government forecasts for China and India, but its projections for the US and the euro-zone also look too optimistic. Among advanced economies, the key differences [between the IMF and our forecasts] are that we are less optimistic about both the US and the euro-zone. With first-quarter growth in the US now likely to be only around 1.0%, the risks to our US forecast are to the downside. And for the euro-zone, the generally disappointing first-quarter data have supported our view that activity is likely to slow this year. Among emerging economies, we think growth in China will be around 5.5%. Note that although this is lower than official and IMF estimates, it would be an improvement compared to last year. For India, too, the difference between our projections and those of the IMF is partly due to uncertainty surrounding the official national accounts data. Finally, although Brazil and Russia\u2019s recessions both look set to continue this year, we expect them to be slightly less severe than is projected by the IMF. (A reminder that there were hopes of an agreement over the weekend.) More on the Greek situation: Oil prices were always going to be influenced by reports ahead of the producers\u2019 meeting, said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, but in practice, any output freeze at January levels may not bring the benefits expected. He said: Rumours of a deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia for a production freeze provided further gains for crude today amid a four-month high for Brent. This week was always likely to see market positioning in advance of the meeting, which has driven substantial gains across the energy sector. However, given that many of the world producers are pumping less than they did in January, a freeze could even increase the amount of crude being produced. Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has said that two bills on pensions and taxes - sticking points in the discussions with the country\u2019s creditors - will be presented to parliament next week, Reuters in reporting. And - something to look forward to - he has also suggested there may be an extra Eurogroup meeting on 25 or 26 April. Earlier senior German government officials told Reuters that there could be no decision on any debt measures for Greece until the bailout review has been completed. The oil price increase is giving some support to stock markets, with the FTSE 100, Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac all climbing around 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 110 points or 0.6%. The positive moves come despite the gloomy noises coming from the International Monetary Fund which has cut its global growth forecasts again. Oil continues to strengthen, now helped by another report that key producers might agree a deal to tackle the supply glut, this time from news agency Interfax: Here\u2019s Reuters on the IMF\u2019s latest comments on Greece: The International Monetary Fund\u2019s chief economist said on Tuesday that Europe will need to show some flexibility towards Greece as it deals with a refugee crisis and negotiates a new bailout package. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly going to be a need for more flexibility to tackle the refugee crisis and some support from the broader European community,\u201d IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said in a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s a European problem, it\u2019s actually a global problem.\u201d He said the IMF has during its negotiations with Athens called for some debt relief, coupled with fiscal adjustments by the Greek government that would put the country on a path towards debt sustainability. The talks are on hold for the IMF-World Bank spring meetings this week in Washington. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking a stand on each particular component. But we need a program that adds up,\u201d Obstfeld said. Here\u2019s a list of the recent Brexit polls: After its earlier strength on the back of higher than expected UK inflation figures, sterling has now fallen back as a new survey shows the campaign for Britain to leave the EU is in the lead. The pound is down almost half a cent to $1.431 as an ICM poll put leave on 45% and remain on 42%. The European Commission has now unveiled its tax proposals for large corporations. Jennifer Rankin writes: Multinational companies will be forced to disclose profits earned and taxes paid in Europe and the world\u2019s shadiest fiscal havens, under proposals announced on Tuesday by EU regulators. The European commission wants all large companies to publish a country-by-country breakdown of profits, taxes, employees and turnover in all 28 member states of the EU, as well as some of the most problematic tax havens. American and Chinese companies with a subsidiary in Europe would also be subject to the transparency drive, as the rules would hit all global corporations with a large presence in Europe. If agreed, the new disclosure requirements would shine a spotlight on some of the world\u2019s most powerful companies, including Apple, Google and Starbucks, which have been caught up in a public furore over their tax bills. Lord Hill, the European commissioner for financial services, said the new rules would give the public \u201ca clear idea of whether a large multinational is paying tax where they make their profits\u201d. The proposals would be good for competition, he said, by levelling the playing field between large corporations and smaller firms. \u201cBy using complicated tax arrangements, some multinationals can pay nearly a third less tax than companies that only operate in one country.\u201d The full story is here: The US should wait until inflation is stronger before raising rates, according to Philadelphia Federal Reserve president Patrick Harker. And negative interest rates, although legally and technically difficult, should not be taken off the table, he said, echoing comments earlier this year from Fed chair Janet Yellen. Harker told a local business group: Although I remain confident that inflation will return to the Committee\u2019s 2 percent target, my outlook sees it doing so only gradually... global headwinds point to some downside risks to my economic outlook. These considerations make me a bit more conservative in my approach to policy, at least in the very near term. Although I cannot give you a definitive path for how policy will evolve, it might prove prudent to wait until the inflation data are stronger before we undertake a second rate hike. So, I am approaching near-term policy more cautiously than I did a few months ago. That is part of being data dependent. And attentiveness to the data will be a key factor in all of my future policy recommendations as well. If financial headwinds dissipate quickly and inflation picks up a bit more aggressively, it will require a slightly more aggressive approach to policy. [But] it will take fewer rate hikes to attain neutrality in policy than it would have 15 years ago. By historical standards, that in itself implies a somewhat shallower path for interest rates than was typical of past recoveries. The IMF\u2019s economic counsellor Maurice Obstfeld has said there is a need for more flexibility between Europe and Greece to handle the refugee crisis and the debt situation. Bruce Springsteen, Paypal and now Deutsche Bank. The bank has added its name to the list of those protesting a controversial anti-LGBT law in North Carolina. It has frozen plans to create 250 new jobs at its Cary, North Carolina, operation after the state became the first in the US to enact legislation requiring people to use public bathrooms or locker rooms that match the gender on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity. John Cryan, co-chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank, said: \u201cWe take our commitment to building inclusive work environments seriously. We\u2019re proud of our operations and employees in Cary and regret that as a result of this legislation we are unwilling to include North Carolina in our US expansion plans for now. We very much hope that we can re-visit our plans to grow this location in the near future.\u201d The bank currently employs 900 people at Cary and said it was \u201ccommitted to sustaining that existing presence.\u201d Last week Springsteen cancelled a concert in North Carolina because of the new law, which critics say legalises discrimination. Bank of America and American Airlines, which are based in Charlotte, have condemned the law, while PayPal cancelled plans to open a new operation center in Charlotte. The IMF is worried about a new phase of the financial crisis, but its proposals to remedy the situation do not go far enough, writes Larry Elliott: The prospect of Brexit clearly scares the IMF. A vote to leave would, it says, have serious consequences not just for Britain and its EU partners but for the whole of the global economy. The Fund is twitchy. It can identify a number of different triggers that might possibly bring about a new, dangerous phase of the crisis \u2013 such as a sharper than expected slowdown in China, a collapse in emerging markets or a pandemic. But with little more than two months to go before the referendum, Brexit is the most immediate threat. But if the Fund is right in its assessment, something will trigger the crisis sooner or later even if Britain decides to remain a member of the EU. The IMF says global growth has been too slow for too long, and proposes a mix of expansionary monetary policy (low interest rates and quantitative easing), higher spending on infrastructure and research and development, and structural reforms to boost productivity. This, though, seems a bit timid if the Fund is right in its analysis that globalisation benefits the few not the many and that a rising tide no longer lifts all boats. In that case, the remedy would not be more R&amp;D spending but checks on financial speculation and more aggressive redistribution. Global growth has indeed been too slow for too long. The Fund\u2019s remedy is too little too late. His full analysis is here: Ahead of its spring meeting the International Monetary Fund has, as expected, cut its forecasts for global growth, at the same time as warning on the risks of Britain leaving the European Union. Katie Allen and Anushka Asthana write: A British vote to leave the EU risks causing severe economic and political damage to Europe that will spill over into an already febrile world economy, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Cutting its forecasts for global growth and for the UK and other advanced economies, the IMF listed a potential Brexit vote in June\u2019s EU referendum as a key risk in its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO)... The IMF now predicts global GDP growth will edge up only slightly this year, to 3.2%, from growth of 3.1% in 2015. That compared with a 2016 forecast of 3.4% in a January update and of 3.6% in the last WEO in October. The 2017 forecast was cut to 3.5% from, 3.6% in January... The IMF cut its forecast for UK GDP growth this year. After growing 2.2% in 2015, the economy was now expected to expand 1.9% in 2016, down from a forecast of 2.2% made by the Fund in January. That compares with 2.0% growth predicted for 2016 by the government\u2019s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility. The IMF left its forecast for 2017 growth unchanged at 2.2%. The full story is here: US import prices rose in March by 0.2% after a revised 0.4% drop in the previous month. The increase came following a rise in the cost of petroleum products, but it was less than the 1% expected by analysts. Brent crude has climbed above $43 a barrel on hopes that next week\u2019s meeting of oil producers can agree to freeze output to tackle the current supply glut. Iraqi oil official Falah Alamri said he was confident that the meeting with Opec and other producers in Doha would reach an agreement. Oil is also being supported by hopes that the Chinese economy is stabilising after a rise in vehicle sales. On top of that, the weak dollar is helping commodities. The gap between UK inflation and average earnings is narrowing: MPs are about to start an emergency debate on the crisis in the UK steel industry. My colleague Andrew Sparrow will be following proceedings in the politics live blog: The dollar has fallen to an eight month low against a basket of currencies as investors continue to bet that the Federal Reserve is in no hurry to raise US interest rates. Meanwhile sterling has climbed to its highest level in more than a week after the higher than expected UK inflation figures. The pound is up around half a percent at $1.4313 after the data, which suggested that UK rates could rise more quickly than people had been expecting. Greece\u2019s inability to wrap up negotiations with creditors last night has fuelled fears that the talks could drag on until the early summer, potentially coinciding with Britain\u2019s referendum on EU membership. Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, reports: Another deadline marked; another deadline missed. Tortuous talks to complete the first review under debt-stricken Greece\u2019s third international bailout are beginning to resemble the momentum that triggered crunch time in 2015. Despite the positive face put on by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who emerged in the early hours to say that progress had been made, there is no hiding the divide that still exists between Athens and the foreign lenders keeping the country afloat. As the straight-talking Oxford-educated finance minister himself admitted: \u201cbecause there are many other small [issues] we did not have the time to discuss it became obvious to all of us that it was not possible to have a staff level agreement by day break today.\u201d Disagreement over non performing loans and pension reforms still linger but beyond discord over Athens\u2019 ability to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % by 2018, it is the much bigger disagreement over debt relief that has come to cloud the talks. The inability of Berlin and the International Monetary Fund to see eye-to-eye on the matter is unlikely to be resolved soon. Even if Greek officials manage to put the final touches to a deal that would effectively conclude the process later this week at the IMF\u2019s spring meetings in Washington DC, in Athens almost no one believes in a similar breakthrough on the crucial issue of debt relief. Without debt forgiveness, few have faith in the shattered Greek economy ever recovering. While the IMF continues to advocate a debt haircut, EU member states led by Berlin have hinted that, at most, a reduction would come in the form of longer maturities and grace periods. In private, leading members of the leftist led government are holding out the hope that Europe\u2019s refugee emergency \u2013 and Greece\u2019s frontline role \u2013 will help cut it some slack. \u201cBut that line of thought could backfire in so many ways,\u201d says Aristides Hatzis, associate professor of law and economics at the University of Athens. \u201cFirst of all from the far right that will exploit anti-immigrant sentiment while the trade off of less reforms for more refugees will, quite rightly, never be accepted by the IMF.\u201d If the talks aren\u2019t concluded by May, Greece, will, once again, face a ferocious liquidity problem just when it confronts \u20ac5bn worth of debt repayments in June and July (money it does not have) and the UK is gearing up for its in-out EU referendum. Newsflash: Saudi Arabia\u2019s credit rating has just been cut by one notch, to AA-, by Fitch. Fitch also left Saudi Arabia with a negative outlook, meaning further cuts are possible. It cited the \u201cnegative implications\u201d of cheaper oil on the country\u2019s fiscal stability, and also pointed to rising tensions with Iran. Has peace broken out at the European Central Bank, between president Mario Draghi and his more hawkish colleague Jens Weidmann? Weidmann, who heads up Germany\u2019s central bank, has leapt to Draghi\u2019s defence against critics - including many Germans \u2013 who oppose his monetary easing and record low interest rates. Speaking to the Financial Times, Weidmann argues (persuasively) that it\u2019s too simplistic to just talk about \u2018savers\u2019 suffering from low borrowing costs. Employees, taxpayers, and anyone with debts are benefitting from the current situation. Weidmann is understood to have opposed some of Draghi\u2019s attempts to stimulate growth and inflation in the euro area. But he\u2019s adamant that politicians should keep their noses out: \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for politicians to have opinions on monetary policy, but we are independent,\u201d \u201cThe ECB has to deliver on its price stability mandate and thus an expansionary monetary policy stance is appropriate at this juncture regardless of different views about specific measures.\u201d More here: Bundesbank\u2019s Weidmann rebukes Draghi critics in Berlin This might ruffle some feathers in Berlin. Last Friday, German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble blamed Draghi for the rise of the eurosceptic AfD party, and declared that central banks should raise interest rates..... British house continue to outpace both the headline inflation rate and average earnings. New figures show that UK house prices increased by 7.6% in the year to February 2016. That\u2019s down from 7.9% in the year to January 2016: Once again, strong demand in London (+9.7%) and the South East (+11.4%) drove the market, while other regions were more subdued. House price annual inflation was 8.2% in England, 2.8% in Wales, -0.8% in Scotland and 2.4% in Northern Ireland. Here\u2019s our news story about the rise in UK inflation in March: The recent weakness in the pound, which has fallen 6% since last October, has also pushed inflation higher (by driving up the cost of imports). Dimitris Hiotis, partner at pricing experts Simon-Kucher &amp; Partner, reckons this trend could continue ahead of June\u2019s EU referendum. With the judgement day on Brexit looming, the sterling has continued to depreciate in recent months, which has increased the cost of imports to the country. As we move closer to the referendum on June 23rd, and with the latest polls showing it to be a close run race, we expect sterling to depreciate further and therefore cause additional inflationary pressures in the coming months. The Institute of Directors (whose members largely oppose Brexit) agrees. IoD chief economist Michael Martins argues: \u201cThe slight rise in inflation is likely connected to depreciation of the pound as uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum increases and international investors begin to sell off sterling. This is not a one-month phenomenon \u2013 core inflation, which strips out volatile factors like energy and food, increased to 1.5% in March, after averaging 1.1% over the last 8 months. \u201cWhile the Bank of England has been keen to see prices rising as a spur to economic growth, if pay rises do not shadow increased inflation, real wages will decline, putting pressure on people\u2019s wallets and holding back increases in productivity. Real wage increases are now under 2% (1.9%), running just ahead of core inflation. This rise in inflation doesn\u2019t mean that the UK economy is healed, argues TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady: \u201cDespite a small rise, the overall picture is still of very low inflation. It indicates that the economy is still not at full strength, with too much underemployment and too little wage growth. \u201cWith the global economy slowing down, the government cannot just sit by. We need investment in skills, infrastructure and public services to promote growth for the long term.\u201d Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), has urged the Bank of England to resist any temptation to raise interest rates at this week\u2019s meeting. He reckons his members have enough on their collective plates: \u201cSmall firms are currently dealing with a raft of challenges, including the National Living Wage which came into effect this month, driving up costs and driving down modest profit. A recent FSB survey showed small business confidence hovering at its lowest level since 2013. Despite inflation edging up last month, our members welcome this ongoing period of low inflation which has helped to keep other operating costs manageable. Economists are split over when the Bank of England might take the plunge and raise interest rates, now that inflation is creeping towards its 2% target. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, reckons the BoE is \u201cmiles away from raising rates\u201d, given the state of the UK economy. Stewart argues: The Bank\u2019s big problem is sustaining growth and getting inflation up. \u201cInflation may have bottomed, but the mounting risks in the global economy, and the continued risk of deflation, means that interest rates are likely to stay on hold until next year.\u201d But Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg reckons the first hike could come in November - unless Britain votes to leave the EU, of course. Looking ahead, we expect the headline rate to increase to 1.6% by the final quarter of the year. Beyond the modest dent to GDP growth in the first half of this year as a result of the financial market rout and Brexit uncertainty, underlying fundamentals point to robust growth at around trend (0.5% qoq) in the second half of the year driven by strong consumer spending and recovering business investment. The on-going acceleration in inflation, alongside consumer credit growth at a decade high, household saving at a historic low and the labour market at full employment begs the question if near-zero rates are still appropriate. Indeed, data for household spending, borrowing and saving point to some overheating in the domestic economy. Therefore, as long as the UK votes to stay in the EU we expect the Bank of England to hike rates by 25 bps in November. We see a 35% chance of a Brexit. Confused about how inflation is calculated? Or wondering why some economists have been fretting about deflation? Our video explainer has the answers... You can see the inflation report here, on the Office for National Statistics website. Today\u2019s rise in inflation may undermine the notion that UK interest rates could stay on hold until 2020. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics certainly thinks so, saying: Inflation pressures are continuing to build, challenging the consensus view in the markets that the MPC will leave interest rates on hold until the end of the decade. The rise in the headline rate entirely reflected an increase in core inflation to 1.5%, from 1.2% in February. About half this increase came from airfares, the rest from stronger inflation in the clothing and restaurant sectors. Airfares were reportedly boosted by Easter in late March, but we have our doubts that all of their rise is temporary. Ben Brettell, senior economist at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown, also believes the Bank of England will sit tight at this week\u2019s monetary policy meeting. Naturally policymakers will need to remain mindful of the risk that inflation overshoots at some point. However, the UK economy is battling a number of significant headwinds at present. Consumer spending, aided by low inflation, low unemployment and rising wages, has been the engine of economic growth lately. But recent surveys suggest consumers reined in their spending in March - perhaps the first sign of nerves ahead of June\u2019s EU referendum. All in all, the economic picture remains highly uncertain and I expect no action from Threadneedle Street for some time yet. Britain\u2019s inflation rate is still far too low to prompt an interest rate rise, says Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International: Today\u2019s increase is unlikely to spur the Bank of England into considering raising interest rates on Thursday with widespread consensus that this week will see the 85th consecutive month that the bank keeps interest rates on hold at their emergency level of 0.50%. Bloomberg columnist Mark Gilbert is struck by the surge in air fares last month. Here\u2019s some details from today\u2019s UK inflation report: Transport: prices, overall, rose by 1.7% between February and March this year compared with a rise of 0.7% between the same 2 months a year ago. By far the largest upward effect came from air transport where the timing of Easter contributed to fares rising by 22.9% between February and March 2016. Fares rose by 2.7% between the same 2 months in 2015. There was also a smaller upward effect from rail passenger transport with fares rising this year but falling a year ago. These upward effects were partially offset by a downward contribution from motor fuels with petrol prices rising by 0.9 pence per litre this year compared with a larger rise of 3.8 pence per litre a year ago. Clothing and footwear: prices, overall, rose by 1.0% between February and March this year compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. Last year was the first time that prices had fallen between February and March since the CPI started in 1996. Normally they rise as they continue to recover following the January sales period. The upward contribution this year came from price movements across a range of women\u2019s outerwear. Restaurants and hotels: prices, overall, rose by 0.5% between February and March 2016 compared with a rise of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward effect came principally from restaurant and caf\u00e9 prices rising by more than a year ago. After falling into negative territory last year, Britain\u2019s inflation rate has now moved towards the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target: And this chart confirms that higher air fares cancelled out the impact of cheaper fuel. The pound has jumped by over half a cent against the US dollar, to around $1.43. Traders are calculating that higher-than-expected inflation figures could mean UK interest rates rise earlier than expected. Britain\u2019s core inflation rate, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, has hit 1.5%. That\u2019s the highest rate since October 2014, indicating that inflationary pressures are building. The early Easter holiday has helped to push inflation up. Holiday air fares rose in March compared to 2015 (when Easter was later). This is the highest UK inflation rate since December 2014, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index anyway. Breaking: Britain\u2019s annual inflation rate has jumped to 0.5% for March, up from 0.3% in February. That beats forecasts of a smaller rise, to 0.4%. More to follow..... The IMF has already cut its forecasts for growth this year several times, as RBS\u2019s economist team point out. Today\u2019s World Economic Outlook, due at 2pm BST, may include further gloom. Hopes that Greece and its creditors could make a breakthrough have been dashed overnight, probably to no-one\u2019s great surprise. Talks between the two sides were adjourned early this morning, and will resume next week once the IMF\u2019s Spring Meeting has concluded. Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters that: \u201cThe Greek government and the four institutions agreed there was progress,\u201d But clearly not enough progress to allow the first review of Greece\u2019s bailout to be wrapped up. There are still significant differences between the two sides, on issues such as pension reform and how to tackle bad loans. Tsakalotos says they\u2019re hoping for a deal by April 22nd. Endless talks. Delays. Postponements. It\u2019s all sounding a bit 2015.... Tax avoidance by multinational corporations will be forced into the open under proposals to be unveiled by European regulators later today following the Panama Papers revelations. The European commission will put forward legislation requiring large multinationals operating in Europe to disclose where they make profits and where they pay tax on a country by country basis. Companies trading in Europe, including large subsidiaries of non-European businesses, would also have to publish how much tax they pay outside the EU with specific information about tax paid in problematic jurisdictions..... Here\u2019s the full story: Shares in luxury goods makers are sliding across Europe this morning, following disappointing results from France\u2019s LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE. Last night, LVMH warned that last November\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris had hit sales in the last quarter. It reported a 4% rise in sales to \u20ac8.62bn; analysts had expected \u20ac8.73bn. LVMH, which owns champagne house Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon and cognac label Hennessy, as well as Louis Vuitton, told shareholders: \u201cThe U.S. market is strong and Europe remains well oriented except for France which is affected by a fall in tourism.\u201d LVMH\u2019s shares have fallen by 3.5% this morning, while Hermes has lost 1.5% and Burberry has shed 1.7%. Troubled UK supermarket chain Tesco has cut back one of its overseas ventures, as it looks to bolster its position back home. Tesco has sold an 8.6% stake in southeast Asian online retailer Lazada to China\u2019s Alibaba Group, raising just over \u00a390m (and giving Alibaba a controlling stake). That could give CEO Dave Lewis a little more firepower for price cuts, in his battle against discount supermarkets. The City isn\u2019t too impressed, though - Tesco\u2019s shares are down 1.6%. London\u2019s stock market has opened cautiously, with the FTSE 100 index dropping by 8 points in early trading. Mining shares are up, partly helped by the weaker dollar. But retailers are falling after a new survey showed that sales fell last month, as wet weather put shoppers off. Jack Lew, the US treasury secretary, has turned the tables on the International Monetary Fund by arguing that it must do more to help the global economy recover. Lew called out the IMF in a speech last night, saying it must be \u2018modernised\u2019. He urged it to: ...intensify scrutiny of critical issues like exchange rates, current account imbalances, and shortfalls in global aggregate demand In other words, he wants the Fund to criticise countries who fuel currency wars or destabilise the global economy by running large trade deficits [such as Britain] or surpluses [Germany, perhaps]. Quite a challenge to the IMF, which likes to use its Spring Meetings to tell everyone else whet they\u2019re doing wrong. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has poured cold water on hopes that a global tax authority could be introduced, to combat tax evasion. Speaking in Washington overnight, she warned that the idea of an intergovernmental UN tax body \u2013 promoted by Oxfam \u2013 faced major obstacles from governments. Lagarde argues: \u201cWe need to be aware of the massive hurdles and obstacles along the way because taxation for the last century or so has been defined, conceptualised, designed, implemented on a purely territorial sovereign basis. And if anything, levying taxation is considered as an attribute of sovereignty, and anything that takes away from that is going to be very strongly opposed by many countries in the world, many forces.\u201d Having said that, Lagarde concedes that the current situation really won\u2019t do. \u201cI think it\u2019s an area where we all have to think outside the box because there are too many boxes in that tax field and thinking outside the box might be of great interest.\u201d More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s an important week for the global economy, as policymakers head to Washington for the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The IMF will be setting the scene today, with its latest World Economic Outlook (at 2pm London time) \u2013 and it\u2019s likely to warn that economic conditions have weakened again. Economists expect the Fund to downgrade its growth forecasts, along with another warning that governments must do more to improve economic conditions. We also get the latest UK inflation figures at 9.30am BST. Inflation remains a rare and illusive beast in advanced economies, but analysts reckon the UK consumer prices index could rise to 0.4%, from 0.3%. A stronger reading might give the pound a lift. We\u2019ll also be watching Italy, where the government has just hammered out a \u20ac5bn fund to support its weaker banks. It also committed to improving bankruptcy rules, to make it quicker and easier to resolve a failing business. Officials are hoping that the plan will ease concerns over the stability of the Italian banking sector, following sharp declines in bank shares recently. And tax is also on the agenda. The European Commission is expected to announce plans to force multinational companies in Europe to reveal all their profits, and tax bills, filed in offshore havens. The plan, which has been in the works for months, has been given renewed impetus by the recent Panama Papers revelations. Here\u2019s a preview:",

A rise in US crude inventories, which contributed to a 1% fall in oil prices, did not dampen the mood, while better than expected results from US bank JP Morgan gave further support to the market.

Joshua Mahony at IG said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Confidence is coursing through the veins of financial markets today, as the worries seen at the turn of the year disappear into the rear view mirror. If yesterday was all about oil, today\u2019s big mover was the US dollar which finally found a buyer after over two weeks of selling. European and US stock markets are clearly in a jubilant mood, with buyers remaining in control since the opening bell. The relative disregard from US markets at the release of the joint worst retail sales figure in over a year, spells out the buoyant mood of markets today.</p> <p>The Bank of Canada maintained its headline interest rates steady today, in line with expectations. Certainly there will be significant relief at the BoC at the recent revival in crude prices, which will help ease the burden of monetary policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has reached its highest closing level since 2 December. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There can be little doubting the fact that London\u2019s FTSE-100 has posted a solid day of gains during Wednesday\u2019s session, realising its first triple digit gain in a month and finding intra-day highs not seen since early December 2015. Commodity prices continue to march higher and that is very much dictating the pace for the markets \u2013 the Dow Jones non-ferrous metals index is up another 6% already and the miners are scattered across the top of the board, but once again Standard Chartered is worthy of note. The bank\u2019s exposure to commodity traders has been something of a millstone, but as underlying prices rally, the stock is back in vogue and today\u2019s 10% gain is certainly impressive.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-570e6b3ce4b00aa863320735\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-13T15:55:37.584Z\">4.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The recent strength of the oil price - today\u2019s fall notwithstanding - has been based mainly on hopes that the weekend\u2019s producer meeting will agree a freeze, along with signs of a slowdown in US output. But, says Capital Economics:</p> <blockquote> <p>There have not been any game-changers in the fundamentals of the oil market itself. Admittedly, US oil production has started to fall. But the declines are small. US oil output was down by about 1.7% year on year in February. What\u2019s more, both the key pillars which have underpinned the recent rally could quickly unwind.</p> <p>Indeed, there is no guarantee of a deal at the weekend. Saudi Arabia has said that it will not participate in a production freeze unless Iran agrees to join as well and Iran has steadfastly committed to increasing its output to pre-sanctions levels. As it happens, we think some sort of compromise agreement is still likely, even without Iran\u2019s full participation. But given that very few of the countries attending the meeting on Sunday have either the capacity or intention to increase output anyway, freezing production at the current very high level should at best put a floor under prices. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-13T15:55:45.669Z\">at 4.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-570e5b62e4b05f26af2e112f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-13T14:48:24.631Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oil prices have slipped further after a much bigger than expected rise in weekly crude inventories, but still remain well above $40 a barrel.

The Dow Jones, boosted by the growth from JP Morgan, edged up 130 points, hitting 17850 and fresh 2016 highs in the process; the FTSE, meanwhile, climbed 120 points to 6360, enjoying the freedom given to it by its China-inspired breakout.

Rob Carnell of ING said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Even when you take some upward revisions into account for February, this is yet another soft retail sales release, and makes an April rate hike look far-fetched.</p> <p>Consensus was hoping that despite the likelihood that the headline retail sales figure would be depressed by very weak auto sales in March, rising gasoline prices would provide some offset at the headline level, and a pick up in underlying sales would prop up the core figures. This did not happen. Indeed, the headline fell by 0.3% month on month, much worse than the 0.1% increase expected, and core figures were also weak, with the control group for sales which strips out most of the volatile components, rising only 0.1% month on month.</p> <p>Moreover, when you take into account that these figures are dollar amounts, and not adjusted for inflation, which most likely rose in March as a result of higher energy prices (data released tomorrow), then it looks as if real consumer spending will barely register 1.0% growth in the first quarter of 2016, and real GDP for the same period will be equally soft.</p> <p>All of which makes it seem highly unlikely that the April FOMC meeting will deliver a further rate hike on top of the December 15 hike. Indeed, some expectations that the April meeting might be used to flag a possible June hike also look stretched following this and other recent soft activity data. We expect some softening in the rhetoric of Federal Reserve speakers in advance of this month\u2019s meeting, so a \u201cno change\u201d will not be a surprise for markets. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-570e44bde4b0283cd85b7297\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/phillipinman\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-13T13:24:06.029Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IMF\u2019s warning on the state of the European banking system is directed at countries on the periphery of the eurozone, and Italy in particular, writes Phillip Inman:</p> <blockquote> <p>Total losses attributed to <a href=\"http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/europeanbanks\">European banks</a> in the last financial crash were around \u20ac1tn, so a repeat of the devastation caused in 2008 could be withstood by just calling on shareholders to sacrifice their equity.</p> <p>If the crash cost more than \u20ac1tn, banks can call on the \u20ac8tn of debts to bondholders, which could be cancelled in part or in their entirety, freeing up cash from interest payments to safeguard depositors. This is a substantial extra buffer. No wonder officials in Brussels, European Central Bank head Mario Draghi and the UK\u2019s regulator, the Bank of England, feel confident a taxpayer bailout will never again be required.</p> <p>So it might seem odd that the International Monetary Fund has sounded a warning in its latest financial stability report about the parlous state of the European banking system...</p> <p>But the IMF is not talking so much about the UK as Italy and other countries in the eurozone periphery. Italy has propped up a forlorn bunch of regional banks that have done little to tackle loans that will never be repaid. Zombie businesses that spend all their spare cash on interest payments, denying them the funds for investment, litter the Italian manufacturing sector, which remains vast...</p> <p>It is estimated that bad loans in Italy account for more than a third of the \u20ac900bn total, which means that a \u20ac6bn rescue fund put forward by Rome is desperately inadequate.</p> <p>So the IMF is less interested in the aggregate figures for European bank funding and more concerned about the weakest link, which experience tells us can set off a chain reaction, bringing good banks down with the bad.

                "bodyText":"Better than expected Chinese trade data which prompted hopes the world\u2019s second largest economy was beginning to stabilise set the tone for a positive day for investors. A rise in US crude inventories, which contributed to a 1% fall in oil prices, did not dampen the mood, while better than expected results from US bank JP Morgan gave further support to the market. Weak US retail sales also helped, dampening fears of an immediate rise in US interest rates. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 jumped 120.5 points or 1.93% to 6362.89, its highest level since 2 December last year Germany\u2019s Dax rose 2.71% to 10,026.10 France\u2019s Cac closed up 3.32% at 4490.31 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 4.13% to 18,165.59 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 3.21% higher at 8820.7 In Greece, though, the Athens market dipped 0.83% to 548.83 on continuing concerns about an agreement between the country and its creditors on its bailout On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 150 points or 0.85%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. It is not just oil which is giving the market a lift. Joshua Mahony at IG said: Confidence is coursing through the veins of financial markets today, as the worries seen at the turn of the year disappear into the rear view mirror. If yesterday was all about oil, today\u2019s big mover was the US dollar which finally found a buyer after over two weeks of selling. European and US stock markets are clearly in a jubilant mood, with buyers remaining in control since the opening bell. The relative disregard from US markets at the release of the joint worst retail sales figure in over a year, spells out the buoyant mood of markets today. The Bank of Canada maintained its headline interest rates steady today, in line with expectations. Certainly there will be significant relief at the BoC at the recent revival in crude prices, which will help ease the burden of monetary policy. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has reached its highest closing level since 2 December. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: There can be little doubting the fact that London\u2019s FTSE-100 has posted a solid day of gains during Wednesday\u2019s session, realising its first triple digit gain in a month and finding intra-day highs not seen since early December 2015. Commodity prices continue to march higher and that is very much dictating the pace for the markets \u2013 the Dow Jones non-ferrous metals index is up another 6% already and the miners are scattered across the top of the board, but once again Standard Chartered is worthy of note. The bank\u2019s exposure to commodity traders has been something of a millstone, but as underlying prices rally, the stock is back in vogue and today\u2019s 10% gain is certainly impressive. The recent strength of the oil price - today\u2019s fall notwithstanding - has been based mainly on hopes that the weekend\u2019s producer meeting will agree a freeze, along with signs of a slowdown in US output. But, says Capital Economics: There have not been any game-changers in the fundamentals of the oil market itself. Admittedly, US oil production has started to fall. But the declines are small. US oil output was down by about 1.7% year on year in February. What\u2019s more, both the key pillars which have underpinned the recent rally could quickly unwind. Indeed, there is no guarantee of a deal at the weekend. Saudi Arabia has said that it will not participate in a production freeze unless Iran agrees to join as well and Iran has steadfastly committed to increasing its output to pre-sanctions levels. As it happens, we think some sort of compromise agreement is still likely, even without Iran\u2019s full participation. But given that very few of the countries attending the meeting on Sunday have either the capacity or intention to increase output anyway, freezing production at the current very high level should at best put a floor under prices. Oil prices have slipped further after a much bigger than expected rise in weekly crude inventories, but still remain well above $40 a barrel. Brent crude is currently down 1.6% at $43.96. Distillate stocks also rose by more than forecast: But gasoline inventories fell back: The enthusiasm for the Chinese export figures has outweighed a host of bad news for stock markets, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: The reasons to abandon the day\u2019s super-surge began to stack up this afternoon, yet the markets remained resolute in their Chinese export-inspired jubilance as the day continued. First Opec cut its demand forecasts for 2016, slashing estimates by 50000 barrels a day with the potential for more revisions to come. Then there was yet another poll outlining the damage that would be dealt in the case of a Brexit, news that was swiftly followed by the announcement of falling retail sales in the US. Adding to the mounting bad news was a report from Reuters stating that US regulators believe JP Morgan (which rose by 3.5%% this Wednesday after revealing a better than expected first quarter loss), Bank of New York Mellon, Bank of America, State Street and Wells Fargo do not have sufficient \u2018living wills\u2019 in place to deal with another financial crisis. Along similar lines the IMF warned that the European banking sector (namely those institutions found in Greece, Italy and Portugal) would be unable to deal with a repeat of the 2008/09 recession, stating that \u2018a more complete solution to the [region\u2019s] banks\u2019 problems cannot be further postponed\u2019. Yet despite this string of scary dispatches from around the world the global indices were in remarkable good health this afternoon. The Dow Jones, boosted by the growth from JP Morgan, edged up 130 points, hitting 17850 and fresh 2016 highs in the process; the FTSE, meanwhile, climbed 120 points to 6360, enjoying the freedom given to it by its China-inspired breakout. Over in the Eurozone the Dax, perhaps intimidated by that looming 10000 mark, slightly underperformed its regional peers, the German index settling for a 2.3% rise compared to the more explosive 3% growth seen by the Cac. The US market has followed other global markets higher after the positive Chinese export data, better than expected results from JP Morgan and the oil price holding onto much of its recent gains. The weak US retail sales have also helped sentiment, suggesting that the Federal Reserve may be reluctant to raise interest rates again in the near future after December\u2019s increase. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 122 points or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 is 0,6% higher and Nasdaq has added 1%. European markets have seen their gains accelerate, with the FTSE 100 up 1.7% to its highest level since early December, while Germany\u2019s Dax is 2% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 2.7%. More on the weaker than expected US retail sales. Rob Carnell of ING said: Even when you take some upward revisions into account for February, this is yet another soft retail sales release, and makes an April rate hike look far-fetched. Consensus was hoping that despite the likelihood that the headline retail sales figure would be depressed by very weak auto sales in March, rising gasoline prices would provide some offset at the headline level, and a pick up in underlying sales would prop up the core figures. This did not happen. Indeed, the headline fell by 0.3% month on month, much worse than the 0.1% increase expected, and core figures were also weak, with the control group for sales which strips out most of the volatile components, rising only 0.1% month on month. Moreover, when you take into account that these figures are dollar amounts, and not adjusted for inflation, which most likely rose in March as a result of higher energy prices (data released tomorrow), then it looks as if real consumer spending will barely register 1.0% growth in the first quarter of 2016, and real GDP for the same period will be equally soft. All of which makes it seem highly unlikely that the April FOMC meeting will deliver a further rate hike on top of the December 15 hike. Indeed, some expectations that the April meeting might be used to flag a possible June hike also look stretched following this and other recent soft activity data. We expect some softening in the rhetoric of Federal Reserve speakers in advance of this month\u2019s meeting, so a \u201cno change\u201d will not be a surprise for markets. The IMF\u2019s warning on the state of the European banking system is directed at countries on the periphery of the eurozone, and Italy in particular, writes Phillip Inman: Total losses attributed to European banks in the last financial crash were around \u20ac1tn, so a repeat of the devastation caused in 2008 could be withstood by just calling on shareholders to sacrifice their equity. If the crash cost more than \u20ac1tn, banks can call on the \u20ac8tn of debts to bondholders, which could be cancelled in part or in their entirety, freeing up cash from interest payments to safeguard depositors. This is a substantial extra buffer. No wonder officials in Brussels, European Central Bank head Mario Draghi and the UK\u2019s regulator, the Bank of England, feel confident a taxpayer bailout will never again be required. So it might seem odd that the International Monetary Fund has sounded a warning in its latest financial stability report about the parlous state of the European banking system... But the IMF is not talking so much about the UK as Italy and other countries in the eurozone periphery. Italy has propped up a forlorn bunch of regional banks that have done little to tackle loans that will never be repaid. Zombie businesses that spend all their spare cash on interest payments, denying them the funds for investment, litter the Italian manufacturing sector, which remains vast... It is estimated that bad loans in Italy account for more than a third of the \u20ac900bn total, which means that a \u20ac6bn rescue fund put forward by Rome is desperately inadequate. So the IMF is less interested in the aggregate figures for European bank funding and more concerned about the weakest link, which experience tells us can set off a chain reaction, bringing good banks down with the bad. For that reason the IMF should be applauded. More here: A day after cutting its global growth forecasts, the International Monetary Fund is talking about the risks of a new financial crisis. Larry Elliott writes: The International Monetary Fund has highlighted risks of a new financial crisis, warning that global output could be cut by 4% over the next five years by a repeat of the market mayhem witnessed during the 2008-9 recession. The IMF used its half-yearly Global Financial Stability Report to call for urgent action on the problems of banks in the eurozone, a third of which it said faced \u201csignificant challenges\u201d to be sustainably profitable. \u201cIn the euro area, market pressures also highlighted long-standing legacy issues, indicating that a more complete solution to European banks\u2019 problems cannot be further postponed,\u201d the Fund said. It said there needed to be a comprehensive strategy to deal with \u20ac900bn of non-performing loans (NPLs) on the books of eurozone banks, adding that banks also needed to be closed in order to deal with excess capacity. \u201cThe hardest hit banking systems within the euro area in February have been those of Greece, Italy, and to a lesser extent, Portugal, along with some large German banks, reflecting some or all of the following factors: structural problems of excess bank capacity, high levels of NPLs, and poorly adapted business models.\u201d Noting that threats to global financial stability had increased since its last health check in October, the Fund said: \u201cThe main message of this report is that additional measures are needed to deliver a more balanced and potent policy mix for improving the growth and inflation outlook and securing financial stability. In the absence of such measures, market turmoil may recur.\u201d It added that there was a risk that investors would demand high interest rates and that tougher financial conditions would create a \u201cpernicious feedback loop\u201d of fragile confidence, lower growth and inflation, and rising debt. The full story is here: Five of the top eight US banks do not have credible plans for winding down their operations during a crisis without being bailed out with public money, according to a report from federal regulators. Reuters reports: The \u201cliving wills\u201d that the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation jointly agreed were not credible came from Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, J.P. Morgan Chase, State Street and Wells Fargo. The requirement for a living will was part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation passed in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when the US government spent billions of dollars on bailouts to keep big banks from failing and wrecking the US economy. \u201cThe FDIC and Federal Reserve are committed to carrying out the statutory mandate that systemically important financial institutions demonstrate a clear path to an orderly failure under bankruptcy at no cost to taxpayers,\u201d FDIC chairman Martin Gruenberg said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s action is a significant step toward achieving that goal.\u201d None of the eight systemically important banks, which the US government considers \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d fared well in the evaluations. A bank has to fix deficiencies only if the two regulators jointly determine its plan does not have the potential to work. The FDIC alone determined that the plan submitted by Goldman Sachs was not credible, while the Federal Reserve Board on its own found Morgan Stanley\u2019s plan not credible. Citigroup\u2019s living will did pass, but the regulators noted it had \u201cshortcomings.\u201d The Fed and the FDIC said they were continuing to assess plans for four foreign banks - Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS. The weaker than expected US retail sales figures could give the Federal Reserve pause for thought on interest rates, said Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: Consumer spending remains a core component of the US economy, so all eyes will be on these latest sales figures from Main Street. Last year, economists heralded the resilience of US consumers as a rare bright spot against a backdrop of turbulent financial markets and weakening global demand, so they will be discouraged by this below expectations performance. These lingering doubts over retail\u2019s strength may force the Fed to give second thought to the rumoured interest rate hike, which some had speculated could come sooner rather than later. A drop in car purchases caused an unexpected drop in US retail sales in March, according to the Commerce Department. Retail sales fell 0.3% after being unchanged in February, and compared to forecasts of a 0.1% rise. Core retail sales - excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services - edged up 0.1% in March, the same as an upwardly revised figure for February. A vote by Britain to leave the European Union would damage the UK economy, according to the majority of economists surveyed in a Reuters poll. Thirty one of the 35 economists polled said the impact of leaving would be negative, but there was a roughly equal split about whether remaining in the EU would be positive or neutral. A vote to leave was also likely to lead to a Bank of England rate cut, the majority of the economists believed. Opec has predicted that global demand for oil will be less than previously expected in its latest monthly report. The oil producers group cut its forecast for 2016 demand by 50,000 barrels a day as consumption slows, and said there could be further downward revisions. Meanwhile it pumped 32.25m barrels a day in March, up by 15,000 barrels from the previous month. The report indicated excess supply of 790,000 barrels a day in 2016 at current levels, up from 760,000 suggested last month. The figures come ahead of a key meeting of producers in Doha at the weekend, which will discuss a freeze in output at January\u2019s levels to try and tackle the supply glut. The oil price has been fairly unmoved by the report, with all eyes on the weekend meeting. Brent crude is down 1% at $44.19 a barrel, in line with its earlier performance. Time for a quick catch-up Stock markets in Asia and Europe have rallied today, after China beat expectations with an 11% surge in exports in March. Augustin Eden, research analyst at Accendo Markets,. sums up the morning: \u201cMid-way through the European session, equity markets are holding firm with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 benefiting from a good set of Chinese trade data - that helping the miners and other EM-focused stocks. Does this mean better times ahead? We must be careful when answering such a question, but with Chinese copper imports having surged by 36% in March, the near-term outlook seems trade positive. So as we stand.... The FTSE 100 index is on track for its highest close of 2016. It\u2019s currently up 90 points in London, led by natural resource companies and financial stocks. Traders are optimistic that the worst of the commodity slump may be over, if Chinese firms are faring better than feared. JP Morgan has reported a 6.6% fall in profits, better than feared. Its shares are likely to rally when Wall Street opens. UK supermarket chain Tesco is under pressure. Its shares have slumped by 5.5%, despite posting its first sales rise in three years, after CEO Dave Lewis warned that the market is challenging and uncertain. Greek bonds have weakened, on fears that bailout talks with its creditors are floundering. Shares in Premier Foods, owner of Mr Kipling cakes and other kitchen staples, have slumped by 30% after a potential takeover bidder walked away. A Chinese hard landing is the number one fear in the City, according to a new survey from Moodys\u2019s. The rating agency found that a third of investors believe China\u2019s slowing economy is the biggest risk, followed to deflation in the euro area. Investors are also worried about a rise in support for European populist parties and Britain\u2019s EU referendum. Anke Rindermann, an associate Managing Director at Moody\u2019s, hopes that a Chinese economic crisis can be avoided: \u201cIt is clear that a slowing Chinese economy is a major concern among market participants. However, rather than a hard landing we expect a continuation of slower GDP growth at around 6% as Chinese authorities continue to use policy measures to avoid a sharp economic slowdown.\u201d Wall Street is expected to open strongly in two hours time: JP Morgan\u2019s shares are up almost 3% in pre-market trading, as Wall Street welcomes its financial results. Bank of America and Citigroup are up around 2% in the pre-market too. JP Morgan has reported a 6.6% drop in profits in the last quarter, down from $5.91bn to $5.52bn. As feared, the Wall Street bank has suffered a fall in revenues from trading and investment banking. But the results look a little better than expected. JP Morgan has posted average earnings of $1.35 per share, down from $1.45, but ahead of forecasts of $1.26 per share. It has also set aside over $400m to cover bad losses in the energy sector. That follows the recent slump in the oil price, which is causing some energy companies serious financial distress. It\u2019s nearly time for JP Morgan to kick off the US bank reporting season, by revealing how well (or badly) it performed in the last three months. Analysts predict that earnings and revenues both fell during the quarter, as investment banking has suffered from lower trading volumes and fewer major deals recently. And the banks always have the capacity to surprise us, as Jeremy Cook, economist at World First, points out: Beneath the optimism in the markets, worries over Greece\u2019s bailout are resurfacing. Investors are concerned by Athens\u2019 ongoing failure to reach a deal with creditors over issues such as pension reforms. So prices on Greek bonds have fallen sharply this morning. And this has driven up the yield, or interest rate, on Greek two-year debt to 12.5%, from 11% yesterday. That\u2019s a 10-week high, and implies a higher risk of Greece defaulting. Talks between Greece and its bailout creditors over the country\u2019s next economic reforms efforts are now suspended until next week. If a deal isn\u2019t reached eventually, Greece won\u2019t have the funds for debt repayments in July. And Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s prime minister, has now arranged to meet with French president Francois Hollande - a key ally - next week. Italian bank shares have risen sharply this morning, up around 6% on average. The \u20ac5bn bank rescue deal agreed over the weekend is bolstering confidence in the sector. But caution is needed -- Italian banks still hold around \u20ac196bn of bad debts, so \u20ac5bn will only be a sticking plaster if the eurozone crisis flares up again. There\u2019s no stopping the FTSE 100 index right now. The blue-chip index is up 95 points at 6337, its highest level since last December. Mining stocks continue to surge, thanks to new optimism about China\u2019s economy following March\u2019s 11% jump in exports. Shares in Anglo American are up 7% and BHP Billiton has gained 6%. Banks are benefitting too. Standard Chartered, which has a big exposure to Asian markets, has jumped by 10% to the top of the FTSE leaderboard. Joshua Mahoney of IG says the City is hoping that the worst could be over for commodities. For the commodities rout to be over a resurgent China is required, and the impressive trade data released overnight provided exactly the assurance we were looking for. While it may be too soon to conclude that the worst is over for China, this revival in exports helps restore confidence as investors pile into commodity stocks once more. David Cheetham of City broker XTB.com reckons Tesco is on the right path, despite this morning\u2019s stock market drubbing: A 0.9% rise in like-for-like sales for Q4 2015 is arguably the highlight of this solid report, and marks the first quarter of comparable sales growth in over three years.... More work is clearly needed before investors can hope for a return to anywhere near the previous levels of stock price, but this morning\u2019s report shows that the current strategy is beginning to bear fruit and the continued attempts by Mr. Lewis to streamline the business and dispose of unwanted segments indicate that the firm won\u2019t be resting on it\u2019s laurels as they strive to return to former glories. Tesco is now the worst-performing share across Europe\u2019s main stock markets, after it warned that the supermarket sector remains tough. Here\u2019s our full story on Tesco\u2019s results: European stock markets are rallying hard, on the back of today\u2019s Chinese trade data. The Italian, German and French markets have all gained around 2%, a strong move, amid hopes that the global economy may be picking up. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct calls it \u201ca rather impressive start\u201d. Commodities remain very much in focus \u2013 we\u2019ve seen base metals soaring in the last few hours helped by upbeat Chinese import data and even if oil prices are coming off the boil a little, the bulls are still winning out at least for now. But investors may be getting carried away..... The 11% surge in Chinese exports in March sounds impressive, but manufacturers are actually still shipping fewer goods abroad than on average, as this tweet shows: News that Chinese exports rebounded in March has \u201cmore than revitalised the market\u2019s spirits\u201d, says Conner Campbell of SpreadEx: Whilst it is too early to claim that talk of a Chinese economic slowdown has been overstated (imports did shrink by 7.6% over March, and there is still the Q1 GDP and industrial production data to come on Friday), the announcement of an 11% rise in the country\u2019s exports has had a miraculous effect on the European indices this Wednesday morning. Tesco is missing out on today\u2019s rally, despite reporting its first sales increase in three years. Shares in the supermarket chain have slumped by 4%, after CEO Dave Lewis warned that hitting analyst profit forecasts for this year would be a \u201cbig achievement\u201d. That\u2019s not what the City likes to hear. Lewis\u2019s caution has taken the shine off today\u2019s results, which showed a 0.9% jump in sales and a small rise in operating profits. Shares are rallying across Europe at the start of trading, as China\u2019s trade figures boost confidence. In London, the FTSE 100 index has hit its highest level of 2016. The blue-chip index has gained 63 points, or 1%, to 6302 points. That\u2019s quite a recovery since the turmoil of January and February, when it fell to 5,500. Mining stocks are leading the way, on hopes that demand for commodities like iron ore, copper and zinc may be picking up. Augustin Eden, research analyst at Accendo Markets, explains why shares are rallying: In March, Chinese exports went up by 11.5% (in US dollar terms), the most in a year and an impressive recovery from February\u2019s 25% slump. That\u2019s sure to indicate that China\u2019s still making stuff, so should be a good thing for companies that produce materials - like miners \u2013 today. Other European markets are also romping ahead. Mixing Ambrosia custard and Bisto gravy with Schwartz\u2019s dried spices would challenge the most daring fusion chef. So perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that an attempt to merge the companies behind these brands has also failed. McCormick, the US food group, told the City this morning that it\u2019s walking away from attempts to acquire Britain\u2019s Premier Foods, which produces Mr Kipling cakes alongside Ambrosia, Bisto and Batchelors soups. Premier Foods had resisted McCormick\u2019s advances, angering shareholders such as Standard Life. And the City is reacting -- Premier Foods share just plunged by 30% at the start of trading! Here\u2019s the story: The rebound in China\u2019s exports shows that pessimism over the global economy is overdone, argues Marcel Thieliant and Mark Williams of Capital Economics: China\u2019s trade data for March point to healthy growth in import volumes and add to growing evidence that the extreme gloom of a few weeks ago about the state of the domestic economy was misplaced\u2026. However, they also point out that the data is muddied by the impact of the Chinese New Year, so we shouldn\u2019t get too carried away. Asian markets are rallying hard, following news that Chinese exports surged 11% in March. The Shanghai stock market jumped by 2%, as investors hailed the better-than-expected trade figures. Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed 2.5% higher, while Australia gained 1.5%. Some investors are calculating that China\u2019s new growth figures, due on Friday, might beat expectations. Economists had forecast that annual growth to slow to 6.7% in January to March, from 6.9%. Perhaps that\u2019s too pessimistic?.... There\u2019s relief in the markets this morning after China posted surprisingly good trade figures. Chinese exports rose by 11.5% percent on-year in March, in dollar terms, the biggest jump since February 2015. That\u2019s a significant recovery from the 25% slump seen in February - when the Lunar New Year disrupted trade. Imports in March shrank by 7.6%, less than expected, after a 13.8% slump a month ago. And this means China\u2019s trade surplus decreased to $29.9 billion, the least in a year. This beats analyst forecasts, and suggests that China\u2019s economy may be avoiding the kind of \u2018hard landing\u2019 that would shake the global economy. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains why traders will be encouraged by China\u2019s trade data: The surge in exports adds to the improving outlook for China indicated by moderating producer price inflation and a rebound in business confidence data. The pickup in exports was likely supported by the devaluation of the yuan at the start of the year which made Chinese goods relatively cheaper than domestic options abroad. Standard Chartered Bank economist Shuang Ding is more cautious, though: \u201cEven with this rebound, first-quarter trade is still quite weak....We cannot be very definite about a turnaround.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a big day for corporate results. UK supermarket chain Tesco is publishing its full-year results today.

Over in Washington, The International Monetary Fund will release its Global Financial Stability Report at 2pm GMT. That\u2019ll highlight the key threats to the world economy. Yesterday, the Fund caused a stir with a warning about Britain\u2019s EU referendum, alongside a raft of growth cuts: And Greece could be in the spotlight again, after failing to reach a deal with its creditors over economic reforms this week. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"Labor has announced a six-point plan to encourage \u2013 but not mandate \u2013 the use of Australian steel in government projects through higher standards and considering a further crackdown on dumping. The government has criticised the policy, saying it amounts to a backdown on comments by the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, last week, questioning what was wrong with mandating the use of Australian steel in government projects. In Wollongong on Thursday Shorten and the opposition spokesman on industry, Kim Carr, said a Labor government would \u201censure Australian standards are upheld in federal government-funded projects and support local producers to meet certification standards\u201d. Carr said imposing Australian standards on steel in government-funded projects when trialled in South Australia had seen the use of Australian steel grow from 40% to 91%. Labor would \u201cseek to maximise the use of locally produced steel in federal government-funded projects and put in place regular reporting of usage levels\u201d. The third prong of the policy would halve thresholds for projects which require Australian industry participation from $500m to $250m for private projects, and from $20m to $10m for public projects. The remaining components would double funding for the Australian industry participation authority, create a national steel supplier advocate and \u201censure Australia\u2019s anti-dumping system has the right powers and penalties in place\u201d. When asked what maximising use of Australian steel meant, Shorten reiterated the plans to expand use of industrial participation plans and crack down on dumping. \u201cEach point of the plan represents the other,\u201d he said. In a statement Shorten and Carr said: \u201cSteel is a strategically significant industry for Australia. We must not become the only advanced economy in the world to let our steel industry die.\u201d Australia\u2019s steel industry was under significant pressure from low international prices, the high cost of raw materials, weak domestic demand and dumping of steel from overseas into the domestic market. The announcement comes after Australian steel producer Arrium went into administration on Thursday, putting 8,000 jobs at risk. \u201cTo secure the long-term future of our local metal industries, we need to make smart use of the opportunities in front of us and build on Australia\u2019s natural strengths,\u201d they said. The innovation and industry minister, Christopher Pyne, said the policy amounted to a backdown: Pyne said Shorten \u201chasn\u2019t got the faintest clue what he\u2019s talking about in terms of industry policy\u201d. \u201cLast week he was insisting all government contracts for construction of steel be done by Australian steelmakers, creating a monopoly for construction steel and flat steel,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only losers out of that are the consumer, the taxpayers of Australia, and of course it is was likely to breach six free trade agreements. \u201cHe\u2019s wildly trying to come up with a new policy idea.\u201d Pyne said the government was bringing forward large construction projects such as the Adelaide-to-Tarcoola rail line and using anti-dumping powers to prevent unfair competition. He wanted to encourage the local industry and said the government had had an industry participation policy for government procurement for many years: \u201cNone of these ideas are new ideas that Shorten and others have come up with.\u201d Shorten denied the steel policy amounted to an increase in red tape: \u201cI believe our policy of maximising Australian steel will see great value for projects using Australian steel.\u201d",

                "bodyText":"Verizon Communications said an ongoing strike by its wireline workers was expected to hurt earnings in the current quarter, even as it reported first-quarter net income that met analyst expectations amid strong tablet sales. Shares of Verizon, the No 1 US wireless carrier, were down 1.6% at $50.18 in morning trading on Thursday. If the strike, now in its second week, goes on for an extended period, it could pressure full-year earnings, the chief financial officer, Fran Shammo, said in an interview. The strike has caught national attention and union workers have attracted the support of Democrat presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019d like to settle this sooner than later,\u201d Shammo said. About 40,000 employees of Verizon\u2019s wireline business, which includes its Fios internet, telephone and TV services, went on strike after reaching an impasse in talks over a new labor contract. Issues include healthcare, offshoring of call center jobs, temporary job relocations and pensions. \u201cVerizon\u2019s first-quarter earnings show starkly how the company\u2019s misguided priorities and scattershot approach to business are hurting customers and the company\u2019s standing on Wall Street.

As part of <strong><a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/business/gertjan-vlieghe-the-bank-of-england-ratesetter-who-didn-t-even-want-to-be-an-economist-a3231651.html\">a profile of the Bank\u2019s newest rate-setter</a></strong>, the subject of interest rates comes up:</p> <blockquote> <p>But could the Bank of England follow the example of others by cutting interest rates into negative territory if necessary? Vlieghe\u2019s answer is intriguing: \u201cTheoretically, I think interest rates could go a little bit negative.\u201d He says that the Bank would \u201chave to think very carefully\u201d about whether the positive effects would outweigh the downside \u2014 as in Switzerland, for example, where mortgage rates went up. </p> <p>He adds, however: \u201cEven if you are willing theoretically to consider negative interest rates, there is only so far that they can go negative before you start worrying about the thing that central bankers have been worrying about all these years \u2014 which is \u2018not only am I not getting any interest paid on my money in the bank, it is now potentially going to charge me, in which case I won\u2019t keep my money in the bank, I\u2019ll just take it out and keep it at home\u2019. Once that happens, that is almost certainly negative for the economy because then you undermine the whole bank funding model... so we want to stay well away from that scenario.\u201d</p> <p>How deep into negative territory could rates go? That depends on the costs to large companies of storing, transporting and insuring huge piles of cash themselves, he argues. \u201cPeople have tried to come up with how much it costs to do that. I\u2019ve seen estimates in the range of anything from 0.75% and up. Once you start thinking about rates 0.75% negative, companies are going to start taking that seriously. I think the switching point is somewhere around minus 0.5%, minus 0.75%, maybe minus 1%. But I\u2019m also saying I don\u2019t even want to get close to it because I don\u2019t know exactly where it is.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2a61a0d6ad2a10a72b4b73af0c2ae66895ef6c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2a61a0d6ad2a10a72b4b73af0c2ae66895ef6c4/18_0_563_338/500.jpg\" alt=\"Vlieghe\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vlieghe</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gertjan Vlieghe</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-571a2f6ae4b054a55f64efa6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-22T14:04:58.947Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A below expectations performance by US manufacturing will be cause for concern, particularly among those who had predicted the sector was heading towards growth.</p> <p>Optimists pointed to last month\u2019s uptick in new orders as a sign of resurgence.

                "bodyText":"Meanwhile the US rig count fell for the fifth week in a row to lows last seen in November 2009, according to Baker Hughes which compliles the data. On that note, it\u2019s time to close the blog for the day and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. And here is some video of the opening remarks from Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem at the Ecofin press conference. And with that the press conference is over. Meanwhile Dijsselbloem has tweeted more on the Panama Papers: Quesionts, and one on the Greek situation and the need to legislate any contingency measures, which the Greeks had said is not possible. Dijsselbloem said the institutions will work with the Greek authorities to design the contingency measures. They need to be credible. [There was mention of a fourth bailout]. Dijsselbloem said this is not about a fourth bailout. This is about if the [proposed] measures do not deliver. \u201cWhen I look at the latest figures, the Greeks are on track, it is an extra security package. If there are legal constraints, we will design it in a way that delivers... and needs to be legally possible of course.\u201d Klaas Knot of De Nederlandsche Bank talked of low carbon economy. Discussed how to help consumers in their decisions by increasing transparency. Essential that adequate price incentives are available. Better disclosure of climate exposure is needed. Stress testing should be introduced [in a co-ordinated way]. This could be taken up, for example, by the European systemic risk board. Working to get agreement on anti-tax avoidance, hope for agreement in May, says Dijsselbloem. Also list of non-co-operative jurisdictions. On money laundering, focus was on terrorist funding, now want more on beneficial ownership and others. Ministers was speedy implementation of transparency, including Panama. Panama Papers gave another boost to our agenda to tackle tax evasion and money laundering. Clear view that Europe should lead. Secondly they discussed strengthening the banking union, with differing views on how to achieve it. Finally, Panama Papers. Hadn\u2019t initially intended to discuss it. They were also discussed in G20 and last week the G5 took initiative on information on ultimate ownership. (As George Osborne said earlier ) 28 others joined it, which is a great outcome says Dijsselbloem. Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem said duing lunch, finance ministers discussed the EU budget, and how the financail framework could better respond to unforeseen events. He mentions in particular the response to challenges like the migration crisis. The Econfin briefing has just begun and can be seen here. A combination of factors has helped push markets lower as the trading week ends, with mixed data from Europe and the US, mining shares lower as metals come under pressure again and the continuing repercussions of the car emissions scandal. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 71 points or 1.11% to 6310 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.6% to 10,373.49 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.29% lower at 4569.66 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.25% to 18,687.04 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.39% at 9232.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.2% to 605.92 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 27 points or 0.15%. Meanwhile Brent crude is up 2.36% at $45.58 a barrel. The damage done to Volkswagen from the emissions scandal has been revealed in its full year results. Julia Kollewe writes: Volkswagen has slumped to its first annual loss in more than 20 years after making a \u20ac16.2bn (\u00a312.6bn) provision for costs relating to the diesel emissions scandal. This pushed VW into an operating loss of \u20ac4.1bn for 2015, bigger than analysts had expected and the company\u2019s first annual loss since 1993, after a \u20ac12.7bn profit in 2014. The company more than doubled its provision for fixing diesel cars to \u20ac16.2bn, a day after announcing plans for the biggest car buyback in history in the US, potentially almost 500,000 vehicles, as part of a deal with the State Department to halt more than 600 class action civil suits. VW said the provision related to the emissions scandal, \u201camong other things for pending technical modifications and customer-related measures as well as global legal risks\u201d. The German carmaker stunned the world when it admitted last September that it had installed software in diesel vehicles to cheat emissions tests \u2013 potentially affecting a total of 11m cars worldwide. Chief executive Matthias M\u00fcller said: \u201cThe current crisis \u2013 as the figures presented today also reveal \u2013 is having a huge impact on Volkswagen\u2019s financial position. Yet we have the firm intention and the means to handle the difficult situation we are in using our own resources.\u201d The full story is here: Here\u2019s our full story on the new \u00a320 banknote: The artist chosen to appear on the next \u00a320 banknote has been revealed by Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Carney unveiled the winner, chosen after the public nominated a number of artists to appear, at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate. Appropriately, it was J M W Turner who will appear on the note, which will enter circulation by 2020. UK chancellor George Osborne has been tweeting about new measures agreed to improve tax transparency: Meanwhile on the currency markets the pound has moved sharply higher after a number of polls gave a lead to the Remain campaign in the EU referendum. Sterling rose by more than half a per cent to $1.4425 and added 0.7% to hit a four week high against the euro. The pound rose 2.3% to a three week high against the yen, helped by the Japanese currency coming under pressure following reports the Bank of Japan was considering expanding its negative interest rate policy to bank loans, and could even cut rates further. Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe has told the Evening Standard that UK rates could theoretically go negative. As part of a profile of the Bank\u2019s newest rate-setter, the subject of interest rates comes up: But could the Bank of England follow the example of others by cutting interest rates into negative territory if necessary? Vlieghe\u2019s answer is intriguing: \u201cTheoretically, I think interest rates could go a little bit negative.\u201d He says that the Bank would \u201chave to think very carefully\u201d about whether the positive effects would outweigh the downside \u2014 as in Switzerland, for example, where mortgage rates went up. He adds, however: \u201cEven if you are willing theoretically to consider negative interest rates, there is only so far that they can go negative before you start worrying about the thing that central bankers have been worrying about all these years \u2014 which is \u2018not only am I not getting any interest paid on my money in the bank, it is now potentially going to charge me, in which case I won\u2019t keep my money in the bank, I\u2019ll just take it out and keep it at home\u2019. Once that happens, that is almost certainly negative for the economy because then you undermine the whole bank funding model... so we want to stay well away from that scenario.\u201d How deep into negative territory could rates go? That depends on the costs to large companies of storing, transporting and insuring huge piles of cash themselves, he argues. \u201cPeople have tried to come up with how much it costs to do that. I\u2019ve seen estimates in the range of anything from 0.75% and up. Once you start thinking about rates 0.75% negative, companies are going to start taking that seriously. I think the switching point is somewhere around minus 0.5%, minus 0.75%, maybe minus 1%. But I\u2019m also saying I don\u2019t even want to get close to it because I don\u2019t know exactly where it is.\u201d Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: A below expectations performance by US manufacturing will be cause for concern, particularly among those who had predicted the sector was heading towards growth. Optimists pointed to last month\u2019s uptick in new orders as a sign of resurgence. However, pressure from a strong dollar and an uncertain business outlook ahead of a turbulent presidential race appear to be taking their toll. The challenge for Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Fed will be to build some momentum for a sector which has stubbornly avoided significant growth in recent months. Over to the US, and some weak manufacturing data for April. The Markit initial reading of the months\u2019s manufacturing PMI fell to its lowest for just over six and a half years, down from 51.5 in March to 50.8 and lower than the 52 level analysts had expected. Markit said production volumes were close to stagnation amid a slowdown in new business growth, and there was the weakest rise in manufacturing employment since June 2013. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: US factories reported their worst month for just over six-and-a-half years in April, dashing hopes that first quarter weakness will prove temporary. Survey measures of output and order book backlogs are down to their lowest since the height of the global financial crisis, prompting employers to cut back on their hiring. The survey data are broadly consistent with manufacturing output falling at an annualised rate of over 2% at the start of the second quarter, and factory employment dropping at a rate of 10,000 jobs per month. With prior months\u2019 survey data pointing to annualized GDP growth of just 0.7% in the first quarter, the deteriorating performance of manufacturing suggests that growth could weaken closer towards stagnation in the second quarter. The survey responses reveal an increase in business uncertainty in relation to both the economic and political outlook during the month, which is weighing on spending and investment decisions and exacerbating already-weak demand both at home and abroad. US investors are in cautious mood in early trading. Dow Jones: -0.07% at 17,969.61 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,086.71 Nasdaq: -0.9% at 4,899.89 Welsh billionaire Sir Terry Matthews said he might be willing to put some of his own money into a management buyout of Tata\u2019s UK business and the Port Talbot steelworks. The Guardian\u2019s Graham Ruddick reports: Matthews said he is \u201cfeeling really good\u201d about the prospects of a rescue deal for the steel business, which could save thousands of jobs in the UK. Matthews, who made his fortune in technology and telecoms, is part of a consortium of public and private sector figures from south Wales supporting a management buyout. The tycoon said the consortium is still putting its team together and its funding has yet to be finalised, but that he is ready to back the buyout. \u201cIf it makes sensible business and the future looks really good, frankly there will be investors and we already know it,\u201d he told BBC Wales. \u201cPotentially me too. The fact is, you first put a really good team together, then you fight in an area which has upside. So I am feeling pretty good about it.\u201d Here is a summary of the main messages coming out of the Eurogroup meeting on Greece. Progress has been made on reaching an agreed package of Greek reforms and a Greek debt deal. Greece and its lenders are \u201cvery close\u201d to reaching a deal on an \u201cupfront\u201d package of measures, worth 3% of GDP. Eurogroup also wants Greece to come up with a package of contingency measures, equivalent to 2% of GDP, as an insurance policy if Greece needs to do more to reach its targets. The IMF would like the contingency plans to be legislated for, to give them credibility. However, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos told journalists it would not be possible to legislate for contingency measures, because Greek law would not allow it. He said Greece and its lenders would instead have to find \u201ca commitment mechanism\u201d. Greece and its lenders are going to work on a deal over the next few days. If sufficient progress has been made, Eurogroup ministers will meet again on Thursday next week. The IMF is ready to dispatch its team back to Athens, to work with Greek officials. Now that the Eurogroup meeting is over, finance ministers have disappeared into the Econfin meeting (which includes all EU ministers, not just those from the eurozone). The Panama Papers and EU budget are among the items on the agenda. Assurances from the Eurogroup that a deal on Greek reform measures and debt is close has done nothing to cheer investors. Most European markets are still down. HSBC escapes a major revolt over executive pay: The Greek finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, has thrown a bit of a spanner in the works over these contingency measures. In a separate press conference, he told journalists that within Greek law, there is no possibility of legislating for something that might or might not happen in the future. Dijsselbloem however seemed adamant the contingency measures would have to be legislated... Tsakalotos said that while Greece won\u2019t be able to legislate on contingencies, it will engage with the Europeans to find \u201ca commitment mechanism\u201d on measures so that credibility and trust is achieved. He seemed broadly upbeat after the meeting: We essentially agreed on the package that was discussed last summer. There are a few technical details left to discuss over the next two days but there wasn\u2019t anybody in that room who challenged the idea that that package hasn\u2019t been done. Any solution will have to meet two criteria. The first is that within Greek law, you cannot legislate contingently. You cannot say you will do \u201cx\u201d if the state of the world, \u201cy\u201d, is in place in 2018 or 2019. And the second criterium is whatever solution we find over the next few days must be credible to the creditors, to investors...and to the Greek people. Whatever solution we arrive at will be done so together with the debt. It is absolutely crucial for us that the whole package on debt and reform gives a clear signal to Greek citizens and to European citizens, and to Greek and international investors, that Greece has turned a corner, that there is a clear runway of exiting the crisis. Greek bond yields have fallen following the Eurogroup meeting, on hopes that Greece is close to agreeing a deal with its lenders. Two year yields fell 52 basis points to 10.46%, while benchmark 10-year yields nudged down by 14 basis points to 8.72%. Christine Lagarde admits that Eurostat\u2019s data (on Greece\u2019s public finances) was more positive than the IMF expected (and other forecasters, she points out), and that might mean the IMF will have to rethink its calculations. However, she suggests that Eurostat might have got the numbers wrong...as they have done before... Dijsselbloem on how the contingency measures to be put forward by Greece might be legislated: In order for the contingency measures to be credible, they need to be legislated. Now how that is designed, whether you just legislate a mechanism, or individual measures is yet to be discussed. Has the Eurogroup given itself too much to do before next Thursday ( when ministers hope to reconvene to discuss progress on Greece), Dijsselbloem is asked. We will all have to bridge our differences. For some of course, the contingency measures are difficult, and for some debt is a big issue, politically difficult. But on all sides it was very constructive today and there was an open attitude to cross that bridge. Dijsselbloem takes a question on the size of the Greek package and contingency measures. He says the upfront package is worth 3% and is almost complete, while the contingency measures will be worth 2% of GDP, to supplement the main package (\u201conly if necessary\u201d). The latest figures from Greece have been quite good so there is reason for some optimism. But to give that extra assurance and confidence, both in the Eurogroup but also outside investors and markets, we are looking for that additional two percentage points. Christine Lagarde is speaking. The head of the International Monetary Fund says progress on Greece is being made. She says measures must be \u201clegislated up front, and credible\u201d. We are confident we can work together well and I have asked my team to be ready to return to Athens right away to continue the work. It has to work on two legs: the measures on the one leg, and debt sustainability on the other. Back at the Eurogroup in Amsterdam, finance ministers support the idea that Greece needs to come up with contingency measures as an insurance policy against \u201cdownside risks\u201d. So that if there is any financial shock and Greece needs to do more, it will be able to do so rapidly. My colleague Jill Treanor is tweeting from the HSBC annual meeting here. Dijsselbloem says that Greece will go away and work both on a possible upfront package of measures, and a package of contingent measures. The Eurogroup will then meet again on Thursday next week (he stresses this is not 100% confirmed yet), to discuss the proposed measures. We will also have a \u201cserious conversation\u201d about a debt relief package for Greece. He confirms there is \u201cno support [among eurozone finance ministers] for nominal haircuts on the debt\u201d. Here we go, Dijsselbloem is taking his place. He jokes about how many press conferences there will be today and tomorrow...three. The eurozone has weathered global events quite well. Having said that, let\u2019s turn to Greece. Co-operation between the institutions and Greek authorities has been strong and productive. We believe substantial progress has been made and we are close to agreement. Today we looked at the way to go forward... The policy package should include a contingent package that should be implemented if necessary to meet the budget surplus targets. The design of that needs further work, what the measures would be and what would trigger it. Journalists await Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is due to give a press conference any minute now. HSBC bosses are in for some stick at today\u2019s AGM... Journalists are reporting long queues to get through security: HSBC is the latest major corporate to face shareholder contempt at its annual meeting on Friday. As the Guardian\u2019s Jill Treanor reports, the Panama Papers, executive pay, and boardroom composition are all expected to be high on the agenda. Oil prices are on course to finish up for the third week in a row. Brent crude oil is currently trading at $44.39 a barrel (down 0.3% on the day). Crude is up more than two-thirds since its early 2016 lows, and traders said sentiment was improving despite a persistent oversupply. Goldman Sachs said in a note: While this recent rally has the potential to run further to the upside ... we believe that is not yet driven by a sustainable shift in fundamentals. Mining giant Anglo American has responded to the shareholder revolt staged at Thursday\u2019s annual meeting. More than 40% of investors voted against the \u00a33.4m pay of the chief executive, Mark Cutifani, in the latest shareholder protest against boardroom excess. The vote was non-binding. In a statement on Friday, Anglo said it was \u201cmindful\u201d of shareholder concerns about executive pay. The mining company said it would consult with shareholders over the coming months before its next annual meeting in 2017, when a revised pay policy will be put to the vote. The company said: Setting executive remuneration in a volatile industry such as mining can be challenging and the remuneration committee intends to again engage with shareholders in order to refine the policy to ensure that it is both appropriate and motivational. Anglo shares are down this morning - along with other miners - falling 2% to 732p. Dijsselbloem is expected to give a press conference following the Eurogroup meeting at 11.15 UK time (12.15 in Amsterdam). We will be reporting his comments, and you should be able to watch the presser live here. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has been spotted chatting to Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, at the Eurogroup meeting in Amsterdam. The two men have been involved in a verbal bust up over the amount of stimulus the ECB is pumping into the eurozone economy, as it attempts to kick-start a meaningful recovery and stave off deflation. Sch\u00e4uble thinks it has gone too far, with record low rates causing problems for German banks and pensioners. Here they are today putting their differences to one side... maybe. Dijsselbloem is presumably on hand in case tensions rise... Judging by your reader comments below the line, you are not convinced there will be much progress made on Greece in Amsterdam today... Back to Amsterdam... You can hear what Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem had to say as he arrived for the meeting here. Among other things, he spoke up for Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, who yesterday fiercely defended the independence of the central bank in the face of German criticism over its stimulus programme. Draghi\u2019s main point was: We obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent. This is what Dijsselbloem said: Mr Draghi has to do his work [independently]. That also means we politicians really restrain ourselves. He has to take decisions that are good for the eurozone as a whole within his mandate, and that is exactly what the ECB is doing. The more we refrain from comments, the more effective he can be. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit and author of the flash Germany PMI report, described growth in the private sector in Europe\u2019s largest economy as \u201cunspectacular\u201d and \u201cuninspiring\u201d. Markit\u2019s surveys for the German manufacturing and services sectors suggest growth in the private sector was the slowest in nine months in April. It was dragged down by the services sector, with the headline PMI falling unexpectedly to 54.6 in April from 55.1 in March. Manufacturing was better, rising to 51.9 from 50.7. Steve Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple, has told the BBC the US tech giant should pay more tax. He said all firms, including Apple, should pay the same 50% tax rate he does. Wozniak, who founded Apple with Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne in 1976, told BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Wake Up to Money: I don\u2019t like the idea that Apple might be unfair \u2013 not paying taxes the way I do as a person. I do a lot of work, I do a lot of travel and I pay over 50% of anything I make in taxes and I believe that\u2019s part of life and you should do it. European investors are lacking cheer this morning, with all major indices in the red: Combined, the manufacturing and services PMIs suggest the French private sector just about scraped growth in April. The composite PMI rose to 50.5 from 50 in March, hitting a five-month high. Jack Kennedy, who compiles the French surveys at Markit, said: The French private sector economy eked out marginal growth at the start of the second quarter after broadly stagnating on average during the opening three months of the year. Expansion was centred on the dominant service sector, as manufacturing was weighed down by a sharp drop in incoming new orders. The PMI data continue to paint a picture of a private sector economy stuck in a weak growth trajectory accompanied by little meaningful job creation. The PMI data for the French manufacturing and services sector is a bit of a mixed bag this morning. French manufacturing activity fell in April at an accelerated rate. The headline PMI index (measuring output, new business, confidence and employment), dropped to an 8-month low of 48.3, from 49.6 in March. Anything below 50 indicates contraction. It was worse than expected, with economists polled by Reuters predicting the headline manufacturing index would pick up slightly to 49.8. The services sector fared better in April, with activity rising to a five-month high. The headline services PMI rose to 50.8 - back in expansion territory - from 49.9 in March. Despite his cheer, Dijsselbloem is already managing expectations about what the Eurogroup will actually achieve today. Greece is trying to hammer out an agreement with its international lenders to unlock further loans, but Dijsselbloem said it was still early days in the process. Speaking in Amsterdam, he said: I\u2019m hearing good news from Athens, so let\u2019s see where we are. If we make progress on the content of the programme and the next steps then we need to start the discussion on debt. We\u2019re only at the beginning of that discussion, so don\u2019t expect any deals today. Debt is a discussion we\u2019ve not had before. The only thing we had was a promise that if the Greeks would commit fully and deliver on the programme we would look at, if necessary, further debt measures. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Eurogroup and Ecofin president (and Dutch finance minister), is welcoming his colleagues to the wonderful city of Amsterdam. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The main event today is the the Eurogroup meeting in Amsterdam, where finance ministers will discuss the latest developments in the Greek debt crisis and try and hammer out a way forward. The meeting will take place 9am-12pm (local time, 8am-11am UK time) at the Maritime Museum in Amsterdam. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Eurogroup (and Ecofin) president will give a press conference when the meeting concludes. It will be followed by an Ecofin meeting - where ministers from the nine EU countries that are not part of the eurozone will join their colleagues. On the agenda there is a working lunch on EU budget problems; a session on the Panama Papers; and a session on strengthening the banking union. We will bring you all the latest developments from Amsterdam throughout the day. Elsewhere we have the flash manufacturing and services PMIs for Germany and France for April, which will offer the latest indication of how Europe\u2019s two largest economies are doing.",

                "bodyText":"The decision on whether to go ahead with the \u00a318bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power project has been delayed again, after France\u2019s economy minister said the country\u2019s energy giant EDF may not give it the green light until September. Emmanuel Macron\u2019s comments come a week after he said EDF would deliver its verdict on Hinkley Point, which is set to meet 7% of the UK\u2019s energy needs, in \u201cthe coming week or month\u201d. EDF said just days ago that it was expecting to make a final decision in the summer, having previously promised to do so by the time of its annual general meeting on 12 May. The fresh delay raises the prospect that even if the project does go ahead, it will not meet its scheduled completion date of 2025, already eight years later than originally planned. Macron told a French newspaper that three conditions must be in place before EDF, which is 85% government-owned, could proceed with building two reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset. He cited an improvement in EDF\u2019s financial position, consultation with French trade unions and unspecified measures to ensure construction goes according to plan. \u201cThe final investment decision could be confirmed next September,\u201d he said.

                "bodyText":"As the US Federal Reserve holds its latest two day meeting there have been more signs the the world\u2019s largest economy is not exactly firing on all cylinders: On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. For those wondering what was happening with the Greek bailout talks and whether there would be a new Eurogroup meeting this week as promised (threatened?), there\u2019s this from a correspondent for Greece\u2019s Kathimerini: Positive updates from the likes of Standard Chartered, BP and Whitbread gave some support to leading shares in London, but other European markets were more mixed. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Significant indecision is evident within global stocks today, as the release of data fails to spark any form of directional volatility. With the [US Federal Reserve] and the Bank of Japan due to take the stand once more tomorrow, there is good reason for today\u2019s hesitancy, given the unpredictable nature of financial markets around these times. A positive start to the day for US markets does little to reflect what has been a largely discouraging batch of data, revealing falling consumer confidence, weaker-than-expected services sector growth and yet another fall in core durable goods. It is clearly a case of bad news is good news as any signs of a US economic slowdown would likely put the buffers on any plans for the Fed to tighten. However, it is worth considering that there is something wrong about a stock market near record highs amid stuttering Chinese growth, tumbling US earnings, an energy price crisis and inflation at rock bottom. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 23.60 points or 0.38% at 6284.52 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.34% to 10,259.59 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.28% lower at 4533.18 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 1.45% to 18,670.41 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.56% at 9283.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.34% to 599.59 Ahead of Apple\u2019s results and the central bank meetings, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 15 points or 0.08%. BHS is not the only corporate problem facing the UK government of course. Steel is still very much on the agenda, and earlier today prime minister David Cameron visited the troubled Port Talbot steel works. The Press Association reports some reaction to the PM turning up: Dai Bowyer, steelworker and Unite executive committee member, said: \u201cMyself and fellow trade union representatives had a constructive meeting with the Prime Minister where we impressed upon him the need to ensure that UK steelworkers have a level playing field on which to compete with our global competitors. \u201cThis included the need for the Government to go further in tackling sky high energy costs and the dumping of cheap Chinese steel, as well as help with high business rates. \u201cDuring the conversation we welcomed the recent commitment by his Government to take a public stake in the UK steel industry, stressing the importance of steel to Britain\u2019s manufacturing base. Clearly impressed by what he saw, we trust that David Cameron will keep his word in doing everything he can to support steel in Port Talbot and the rest of the UK.\u201d Meanwhile US oil giant Exxon Mobil has had its credit rating cut by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s to reflect the plunge in crude prices: Back with the US consumer confidence figures, which come before the latest Federal Reserve decision on Wednesday and Thursday\u2019s US GDP numbers. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: While remaining steadfast, American consumers don\u2019t appear to be wildly optimistic about the future which will help inform [Fed chair] Yellen and Co.\u2019s decision on interest rates tomorrow. All eyes now turn to the Q1 GDP figures on Thursday, where the first effect of Yellen\u2019s December interest rate rise will be seen. Conservative MP Richard Fuller, who on Monday described leaving the idea of the taxpayer picking up the bill for the BHS pensions shortfall as \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d, has demanded Sir Philip Green clarify his involvement in the demise of the retailer. He said (quotes from PA): Green and Arcadia need to put out a statement immediately clarifying their position. He has a responsibility, a duty. Arcadia should be made to make public the documents and correspondence between themselves and Retail Acquisitions so that we can ascertain if the correct due diligence was undertaken in terms of there being enough cash left in the business and to cover the pension liability. If it\u2019s found that the correct due diligence was not undertaken, the Sir Philip will face serious consequences. The Press Association have confirmed that a letter of invitation will soon be winging its way to Sir Philip Green. Asked whether Sir Philip would be called before the committee, Mr Field told the Press Association: \u201cI am sure he will be invited to give evidence.\u201d Breaking: Sir Philip Green is being called to parliament to be questioned by the Work and Pensions Committee over the collapse of BHS. This follows committee chair Frank Field\u2019s decision to open an inquiry into the impact of BHS\u2019s administration (see earlier post). They will investigate how BHS\u2019s 571m pension deficit will affect Britain\u2019s Pension Protection Fund, a rescue scheme funded by contributions from other pension pots. The Wall Street Journal has a good piece on how many pension funds are struggling right now. The Collapse of BHS is a Warning for the U.K\u2019s Faltering Pension Schemes Here\u2019s a flavour: The problems for BHS\u2019s pension scheme are particularly acute, but it\u2019s not alone by any means. Schemes all across Europe are being squeezed by two pincers: an increasing number of elderly people relative to the working population, and shrinking interest income. As long as those two trends continue, BHS isn\u2019t going to be the last company to struggle under the weight of its pension liabilities. And this graph underlines why the problem is getting worse: More disappointing US economic data: Christmas seems to come round earlier every year in the shops. But at BHS\u2019s store in Friars Square, Aylesbury, staff are still trying to shift last year\u2019s stock.... Back to BHS... and our veteran political commentator Michael White has written about how our elected masters have a blind spot when it comes to business bosses. Here\u2019s a flavour of his latest Political Briefing. BHS paid Phil and Tina [Green] a lot of rent (\u00a311m a year) on its 164 stores. Crafty or what! It\u2019s the same story we heard when the Southern Cross care homes group collapsed in 2011. It had been financially re-engineered after being sold to Blackstone, the US private equity crowd. The homes were sold as a property business, then leased back at high rents by the care business. Together with falling local authority fees for elderly patients \u2013 that\u2019s austerity for you \u2013 it bust the model. The scandal at Boots exposed this month by the Guardian is quite different, but the idea is the same. Sweat the assets while loading the core business with debt, so you can move on and do it again. It\u2019s the task of governments everywhere to hold the line, to see such activities are robustly regulated, their entrepreneurs honoured when they do well by society as well as themselves, jailed if they commit fraud, condemned when their legal manoeuvres are transparently immoral as some of King Phil\u2019s have been \u2013 despite protests of injured innocence. Alas, Blair gave him the knighthood he wanted for \u201cservices to the retail industry\u201d. And David Cameron? After King Phil repaid Labour for its obsequiousness by publicly backing the Tories in 2010, the new PM asked him to review government spending and procurement. Phil reported back that there\u2019s a lot of waste. Angels wept. Here\u2019s the full piece: The latest economic data from America is a little disappointing, showing that the global economy may be weaker than hoped. Orders for durable goods, such as computers, kitchen equipment and even aeroplanes, rose by just 0.8% in March after a 3.1% slump in February. Economists expected a 1.8% recovery, so they\u2019re now a little worried. Separately, US house price growth has cooled to a 5.4% annual rate in February, down from 5.7% in January. Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s official spokeswoman has declined to comment on criticisms of Sir Philip Green: She told today\u2019s Lobby briefing that the government is concentrating on helping BHS staff. I\u2019ve taken the quotes from the Press Association: \u201cIt is a worrying time for BHS staff and their families. We have now got the Pensions Protection Fund carrying out an assessment. It\u2019s usual in this type of case for the Insolvency Service to also look into what\u2019s happened. I think we need to let these assessments take place first. \u201cWe are currently focused on what this means for BHS staff moving forward and what the Government can do to support them.\u201d It\u2019s official: high street tailor Austin Reed has followed BHS into administration. The move leaves around 1,100 workers facing redundancy. Administrators are hoping to sell the company as a going concern, so the stores are staying open for now. Here\u2019s the full story: The company is offering some chunky discounts today.... Bad news for BHS: property agents have warned that a quarter of its high street stores would be hard to let to new tenants, while only 8% are in \u2018prime\u2019 locations. That undermines the chances of a white knight buyer snapping up the whole company, argues Joanna Bourke of the Evening Standard. More here. John Mann\u2019s call for Sir Philip Green to lose his knighthood, unless he hands back \u00a3400m of dividend payments, puts more pressure on the Arcadia boss. Julie Palmer, regional manager at business restructuring specialists Begbies Traynor, says it is becoming an issue of fairness and morality, not just legality. She told the BBC earlier today that: \u201c[Sir Philip] is an astute businessman, I imagine he was advised and that all of that was done properly. There\u2019s a moral issue that if we are facing a pensions deficit of \u00a3571 million do we look beyond the boundaries of legality at propriety instead? I understand he already is in discussions to make a voluntary payment which suggests he is aware. \u201cI don\u2019t think the administrator will [bring moral pressure into it] but there are MPs already on the case. There are calls about whether he should be able to keep his knighthood. That\u2019s all part of the pressure that is beginning to build.\u201d Via the Independent. Breaking away from BHS again, Prime minister David Cameron is making a surprise visit to the troubled steelworks in Port Talbot, South Wales, today. More than 4,000 jobs are still at risk at the Port Talbot side, following Indian conglomerate Tata\u2019s decision to sell up. The government is offering to take a 25% stake in the steelworkers, plus debt relief, in an attempt to find a buyer. Cameron\u2019s visit may be designed to show that Westminster hasn\u2019t forgotten about the steel crisis. As it happens, there\u2019s a BHS store up the coast in Swansea - perhaps the PM could pop in there afterwards and offer workers his support.... The House of Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee has announced an inquiry into BHS\u2019s pensions deficit. The committee will examine how the UK\u2019s Pension Protection Fund will cope with BHS\u2019s \u00a3571m pension deficit. The PPF steps in when a company cannot handle its pension liabilities, and is funded by levies on other pension schemes. So BHP\u2019s costs will Committee chair Frank Field says the BHS crisis has raised serious questions: \u201cWe need as a Committee to look at the Pension Protection Fund and how the receipt of pension liabilities of BHS will impact on the increases in the levy that will now be placed on all other eligible employers to finance the scheme. We will then need to judge whether the law is strong enough to protect future pensioners\u2019 contracts in occupational schemes.\u201d Yesterday, MPs on all sides of the House of Commons expressed concern over the BHS crisis, particularly the pensions issue. Conservative MP Steve Baker argued that the free market was seriously undermined when vast profits are privatised, and then similarly larges losses are swiftly dumped on taxpayers or pensioners. And fellow Tory Richard Fuller said dumping pensions obligations on others was \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. Sir Philip Green has not enjoyed reading today\u2019s newspapers: What did the Mirror do to earn such shocking opprobrium? Well, today\u2019s edition describes Green thus: He\u2019s the epitome of a self-made man or, depending upon your point of view, an icon of unmitigated greed. A foul-mouthed, tough-talking billionaire whose number-one aim is making money, and woe betide anyone who gets in his way. Later adding..... When he turned 50, his wife Tina reportedly gave him a solid gold Monopoly set. He celebrated the birthday by flying 200 pals to Cyprus for a lavish toga party, with Tom Jones entertaining them. Green himself was dressed, according to business journalist Jeff Randall, as \u201ca physically challenged Nero\u201d. And for his 60th, he flew 150 guests to Mexico, allocated each 15 bottles of Pol Roger \u2013 worth \u00a3250 each \u2013 and had Stevie Wonder and the Beach Boys perform. Here\u2019s the full story: BHS boss Philip Green built his empire on cost-cutting and ruthless deals Here\u2019s a reminder of just how much money the Greens received from BHS during their 15-year ownership: Labour MP John Mann has called for Sir Philip Green to be stripped of his knighthood, unless he returns the dividends paid to his family from BHS. Mann argues that Green should hand back the \u00a3400m which he received from BHS, to help cover the \u00a3571m pension black hole. In a statement, Mann says: \u201cSir Philip Green and his family have made millions out of BHS and its hard working staff. He took over a company with a healthy pension pot, yet when he sold BHS a black hole had appeared in its fund.\u201d \u201cSir Philip Green has taken over \u00a3400 million out of the company and now must be held responsible for the actions that were taken under his stewardship.\u201d \u201cThere is a very simple and honourable solution to this crisis; repay the dividends, live up to the name he has chosen for his new yacht, \u2018Lionheart\u2019, or lose his knighthood.\u201d It\u2019s rare to see a Labour MP agree with the Daily Mail, but on this issue Mann is in complete agreement with the mid-market paper (see earlier post). The pound hit a 10-week high this morning, as bookmakers slash the odds of Britain remaining in the European Union. Sterling has gained almost a cent against the US dollar, to $1.457, as traders anticipate that the Remain campaign will win the June 23 referendum. Another high street name, fashion retailer Austin Reed, is collapsing into administration this morning. The announcement could come at 11am, we hear. In another triumph for free market capitalism, Scottish Power has been slapped with an \u00a318m fine for unacceptably poor customer service. Angela Monaghan explains: Dermot Nolan, Ofgem\u2019s chief executive, said Scottish Power\u2019s treatment of gas and electricity customers had been \u201cdiscernibly worse\u201d than its peers. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he added: \u201cThis is a significant amount of money. It\u2019s basically because Scottish Power failed to treat its customers fairly over a sustained period of time.\u201d The chair of the BHS pension fund trustees has revealed he was surprised that Retail Acquisitions wanted to buy BHS last year, given its pension deficit. Chris Martin told the Today Programme that: It\u2019s always difficult when a company is sold with a large pension deficit. You wonder why the purchasers would want to buy the company. But they did. And we engaged with them and we talked to them about the funding obligations to the scheme. Unfortunately, the trading of the business meant it couldn\u2019t support any contributions to the scheme and hence it\u2019s now in the position it\u2019s in. The good news, if there is any good news, for pension scheme members is that the PFF is in place and supporting their pension obligations. Martin insists, though, that the pension scheme hasn\u2019t dramatically deteriorated in the last year. The BBC\u2019s business editor Simon Jack has been outlining Philip Green\u2019s defence against criticism over the BHS crisis. He ran this company for 15 years, he employed thousands and thousands of people, and he was a great force for UK fashion retail and made it a big force both here in the UK and the US. It doesn\u2019t look good as he jumps on his yacht to go back to Monaco with his arm around Kate Moss, leaving employees and pensioners worried about it. But he\u2019s not a natural corporate raider. He\u2019s not necessarily the vulture type of capitalist that people may have portrayed him in the last couple of days. Green does have questions to answer, though, for selling BHS to an \u201cunknown bunch of brokers, financiers and lawyers\u201d They didn\u2019t invest in the company but proved very adept at getting money out of it, Jack points out. \u00a325m, by our maths. With profits up 12%, Whitbread is profiting from Britain\u2019s \u201clong working hours culture\u201d. So argues Steve Clayton, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown: \u201cCosta is busily slaking the nation\u2019s never ending thirst for caffeine; think of it as an investment play on the UK\u2019s long hours work culture. Premier Inn is a great product; a clean comfortable room, in a good location at a sensible price. With over 60,000 rooms in the estate, it is the clear market leader in the UK branded budget hotel sector. Labour MP Owen Smith, the Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, isn\u2019t impressed with BP\u2019s results: (that loss was on a \u2018replacement cost\u2019 basis, adjusting for moves in the oil price but not stripping out one-off charges) Over in the City, shares in Whitbread have jumped 3.6% to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard after it reported a 12% rise in underlying pretax profits. BP are close behind, up 3.1% despite suffering an 80% slump in earnings. Investors are relieved that it wasn\u2019t even worse, and pleased to hear CEO Bob Dudley promising further spending cuts... The Times have pinned the blame for BHS\u2019s failure firmly on current owner Dominic Chappell. The twice-bankrupt racing driver simply lacked the skills to turn the group around after buying it from Philip Green for \u00a31, argues Deirdre Hipwell. Here\u2019s a flavour: Sir Philip Green said that he had sold BHS \u2018100 percent clean\u2019, adding: \u201cIf I give you my plane, right, and you tell me you\u2019re a great driver and you crash it into the first f****** mountain, is that my fault? For many in the market, the answer to that question is \u2018yes\u2019, arguing that it was his fault for selling a fragile business to Mr Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions, which appears to have had neither the skills nor means to save it A veteran propert expert who declined to deal with BHS under its new owners said: \u201cYou have to accept the fact that Chappell is a buffoon\u201d More here: \u2018Buffoon\u2019 drove struggling retailer into ground Four UK newspapers are leading on BHS\u2019s collapse into administration: Today\u2019s newspapers are packed with criticism of BHS\u2019s present, and former owners. In the Daily Mail, Alex Brummer has outlined what a poor state the company was in, by the time Sir Philip Green sold it for a pound last year. BHS had nowhere to go but the knacker\u2019s yard. All it consisted of was an outdated, declining enterprise, with a collection of unattractive, near valueless shop leases and a liability in its pension fund of \u00a3571 million. By selling when he did, Green put enough distance between himself and the new owners before the all-but-inevitable end arrived. By the time he sold, he had ensured that most of the real value of the business, including the \u00a340 million freehold of BHS\u2019s imposing headquarters in Marylebone in West London, from where Green liked to hold court, was owned directly by his family. And that leaves BHS workers facing a 10% cut to their pensions, if they are bailed out by the UK\u2019s pension protection fund. Brummer argues that Sir Philip should pay the ultimate price - demotion to the ranks - if he doesn\u2019t reach deep into his pocket to cover the \u00a3571m pension black hole. If he doesn\u2019t stump up, however, the knighthood bestowed upon him by Tony Blair \u2014 for Green\u2019s donations to flagship fashion academy schools \u2014 could be taken away from him. Veteran pensions and welfare campaigner Frank Field MP has called for Green to lose his knighthood in the manner of Fred Goodwin, the disgraced former boss of the Royal Bank of Scotland. It would be the ultimate humiliation if Sir Philip were to join the select company of business people stripped of the honours of which they had once been so proud. The recent slump in oil and gas prices has sent profits at oil giant BP slumping by almost 80%. The company has reported an underlying replacement cost profit of $532 million, from $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2015. That\u2019s despite slashing its capital expenditure bill by $500m, as it cuts back on new projects. Analysts had feared a loss. And chief executive Bob Dudley, who suffered a humiliating shareholder rebellion over his \u00a313m pay package last week, claims the situation is improving. He says: \u201cdespite the challenging environment, we are driving towards our near-term goal of rebalancing BP\u2019s cash flows.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today, we\u2019ll be tracking the BHS crisis again. Eleven thousand jobs are on the line at its 164 stores, in the biggest retail failure since Woolworths in 2008. And criticism is mounting against firm\u2019s owners, Retail Acquisitions, and former boss Sir Philip Green, over a fiasco that could leave the taxpayer covering BHS\u2019s pension blackhole. Today\u2019s Guardian has splashed on the discovery that Retail Acquisitions have received a tasty \u00a325m since acquiring the high street chain barely a year ago. Sources with knowledge of BHS\u2019s finances have told the Guardian that more than \u00a325m was paid from BHS to Retail Acquisitions in the past 13 months. This included \u00a32.8m in management fees, \u00a32.1m in salaries and wages, \u00a311m in legal and professional fees and \u00a310m in interest payments. The man behind Retail Acquisitions is Dominic Chappell, a former racing driver who has been declared bankrupt twice. Chappell owns 90% of Retail Acquisitions,which bought BHS for \u00a31 from Green in March 2015. Green was heavily criticised by MPs in parliament last night, with talk of \u2018serious questions to answer\u2019 and \u2018the unacceptable face of capitalism\u2019. He\u2019s now facing questions over how his family took out \u00a3400m in dividends from BHS before selling it. They\u2019ve certainly got some fun out of the cash. As Sarah Butler explains: Even after the financial crisis hit the UK economy in 2008, the Greens have partied on. The family enjoy several weeks a year at the exclusive Barbados resort Sandy Lane, where they can hang out with friends such as Simon Cowell. In 2012, the family apparently shelled out more than \u00a33m to fly 150 guests \u2013 including Cowell, Kate Moss, Holly Valance, and her partner, the property developer Nick Candy \u2013 to Mexico\u2019s Yucatan peninsula for Green\u2019s 60th birthday party. Rihanna and Stevie Wonder were reportedly flown in to provide the entertainment. But that was a relatively muted affair compared to Green\u2019s 50th birthday bash, for which he chartered a private jet to fly 200 guests, including journalists and other business associates, to Cyprus for a three-day toga party at a cost of \u00a350m.... Also coming up... It\u2019s the start of the oil reporting season, with BP releasing results for the last quarter. Whitbread, the firm behind Premier Inns and Costa Coffee, are also updating the City. There\u2019s no significant European economic data today, but we do get the latest US durable goods orders (for March) at 1.30pm BST, followed by US consumer confidence report at 3pm BST. Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to inch higher this morning, after two days of falls. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

The country has still not got back on its feet, even though it has received hundreds of billions in emergency loans. When will the madness end?</strong></p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> Clearly, last year was an economic setback for Greece. Now everyone is aware that there can be no growth without reforms. And what the country and its citizen need above all is growth. Greece has implemented many reforms in the past months and is committed to the path of reforms.</p> <p><strong>BILD: Is the euro a part of the solution for Greece, or a part of the problem?</strong></p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> Greece\u2019s challenges have little to do with the euro. It would have to implement reforms in any case. In the Eurozone, Greece can do that with the support of its partners. But one thing must be clear: who belongs in the euro area and who does not is not for the ECB to decide. That is a matter for the Member States.</p> <p><strong>BILD: They are now more fractious than ever. Is that the biggest danger for Europe?</strong></p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> We are experiencing several crises which are all interconnected and reinforce each other. That makes it all the more important to resist every kind of nationalism or isolationism. Both are however on the rise. That worries me a lot.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff244549aa407d64160c9faaa4c0b8c8ca75a9d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff244549aa407d64160c9faaa4c0b8c8ca75a9d4/0_281_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Draghi (centre) at the end of last week\u2019s ECB press conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi (centre) at the end of last week\u2019s ECB press conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5720d938e4b0ba980af16e9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-27T15:31:14.380Z\">4.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of a visit to the German parliament, ECB president Mario Draghi has given an interview to Bild newspaper.</p> <p>Draghi has been criticised in Germany for the ECB\u2019s low interest rate policy, which has affected the country\u2019s savers, and has also been attacked by German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble.</p> <p>In the interview - <strong><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/draghi-germany-is-fundamentally-wrong-when-its-comes-to-investing-2016-4?IR=T\">which has been repeated in English by Business Insider</a></strong> - he has come out fighting\u201d</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Draghi: </strong>We are well aware of the situation for savers. And it\u2019s not only in Germany that people have to face low interest rates. But interest rates are low because growth is low and inflation is too low. Think about the alternative: if we raised rates now, it would be bad for the economy and we would unleash deflation, unemployment and recession. The interest on savings comes from growth, so the interest of savers is that inflation stabilises and growth becomes more robust. Besides, many savers benefit from low interest rates as they are also homebuyers, taxpayers, entrepreneurs and workers whose companies are benefiting.</p> <p><strong>BILD: In Germany the adverse effects are predominant. Making provision for retirement is becoming increasingly difficult\u2026</strong></p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> Remember, what counts is what you earn on savings in real terms, i.e. interest minus inflation. This is higher today than it was in the 1990s. At that time you might have had a higher interest rate on your Sparbuch, but we often had an inflation rate that was higher still. So you could buy less with the money you received. Moreover, people can influence how much they get on their savings even in times of low interest rates. They don\u2019t just have to keep the money in savings accounts but can invest in other ways. The Bundesbank has recently shown that the average return on all German household assets is close to 2%.</p> <p><strong>BILD: So, are the German savers themselves to blame?</strong></p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> No. But there are alternatives in investing savings. In the United States savers had to face seven years of zero interest rates. Banks, insurers, the financial system nevertheless still worked. Money was invested in a variety of ways which in the end enabled a decent return.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said he did not take the criticism from the likes of Sch\u00e4uble personally but added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One thing is clear: the ECB obeys the law, not the politicians. Or, as one of my predecessors put it, it is normal for politicians to comment on our actions. But it would be abnormal if we listened to them.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he defended the ECB policies, saying they were working:</p> <blockquote> <p>But we must be patient; investor confidence has not yet been fully restored. For two years, the economy in the euro area has been growing month by month, banks are lending and unemployment is steadily falling,. Meanwhile, euro area countries are now able to buy more German exports again, which, for German companies, is partly making up for the decline in trade with China. But it is a slow process because the crisis was more severe than anything we had since the Second World War.</p> </blockquote> <p>As to when interest rates would rise, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Quite simple: when the economy is growing more strongly again and inflation rises closer to our objective. Low interest rates today will lead to higher rates tomorrow.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he said the majority of governments were acting on the necessary reforms \u201calbeit too slowly for my personal taste. All of them would be well advised to do more. But that is not primarily dependent on the ECB and its policies.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-27T15:39:18.324Z\">at 4.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5720d77de4b09a82af1484ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-27T15:17:51.367Z\">4.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The US Treasury secretary undersecretary for international affairs, Nathan Sheets, has been speaking to a House financial committee, and made some comments on the situation in Greece</strong>.

Here\u2019s why:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Firstly, the consumer economy is coming off the boil</strong>. Retail sales volumes have fallen for two consecutive months on the latest ONS data. Rising inflation later this year and into 2017 will take further steam out of the household-led recovery, as will signs of a softening in the labour market with some high profile companies announcing job cuts in recent weeks.</p> <p><strong>The UK\u00b4s international trade position is also a major concern.</strong> The current account data released last month showed a record high deficit of 7% of GDP at the end of last year - now greater than the fiscal deficit. Essentially, the country\u2019s poor position on exports and overseas investments means that the UK is now borrowing a huge sum of money from the rest of the world each year.

                "bodyText":"Another rise in the oil price helped lift stock markets, even though crude came off its best levels following a bigger than expected rise in US inventories. UK GDP was in line with forecasts, while there was a positive reaction to a number of company results including Barclays and GlaxoSmithKline. Apple\u2019s disappointing figures however left technology shares flagging, and investors remained cautious ahead of the latest rate setting meetings from the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 35.39 points or 0.56% at 6319.91 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.39% to 10,299.83 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.58% to 4559.40 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.43% to 18,750.62 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.53% higher at 9332.6 In Greece, the Athens market fell 2.51% to 584.55 on renewed concerns about its bailout and new disagreements with its creditors On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 22 points or 0.13% ahead of the Fed. Meanwhile Brent crude is currently up 1.16% at $46.27 a barrel having earlier climbed as high as $47.05. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Citi has come up with forecasts for interest rates in the UK, eurozone and Japan: Here\u2019s Reuters latest story on the situation between Greece and its creditors: Greece accused the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday of undermining negotiations over the release of more bailout funds needed in the next few weeks to repay debt. At issue is what measures Athens would take if it fails to reach fiscal targets by 2018. Creditors, including the IMF and European institutions, want those measures made law immediately. Athens argues that its constitution precludes legislation on a hypothetical event but it has offered to discuss a mechanism of automatic cutbacks. Government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili told reporters that the IMF had not accepted the proposal. \u201cThe IMF is making demands which go beyond what was agreed,\u201d Gerovasili said, referring to a 86-billion-euro ($97-billion) deal struck last year and talks to unlock more than five billion euros in bailout funds needed to pay EU and IMF debts by July. \u201cThese demands undermine efforts by both the Greek government and European institutions,\u201d she said. An IMF spokesman in Washington said the institution had no immediate comment on the matter. More on Greece: The interview closes with Draghi saying it will be his pleasure to go to the Bundestag. On the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union, Draghi says: I cannot and do not wish to believe that the British would vote to leave, because we are stronger together. But if they do, it should be clear: they would lose the benefits of the single market. Draghi was also asked about Greece: BILD: Mr Draghi, in your first interview with BILD four years ago, we spoke a lot about Greece. The country has still not got back on its feet, even though it has received hundreds of billions in emergency loans. When will the madness end? Draghi: Clearly, last year was an economic setback for Greece. Now everyone is aware that there can be no growth without reforms. And what the country and its citizen need above all is growth. Greece has implemented many reforms in the past months and is committed to the path of reforms. BILD: Is the euro a part of the solution for Greece, or a part of the problem? Draghi: Greece\u2019s challenges have little to do with the euro. It would have to implement reforms in any case. In the Eurozone, Greece can do that with the support of its partners. But one thing must be clear: who belongs in the euro area and who does not is not for the ECB to decide. That is a matter for the Member States. BILD: They are now more fractious than ever. Is that the biggest danger for Europe? Draghi: We are experiencing several crises which are all interconnected and reinforce each other. That makes it all the more important to resist every kind of nationalism or isolationism. Both are however on the rise. That worries me a lot. Ahead of a visit to the German parliament, ECB president Mario Draghi has given an interview to Bild newspaper. Draghi has been criticised in Germany for the ECB\u2019s low interest rate policy, which has affected the country\u2019s savers, and has also been attacked by German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. In the interview - which has been repeated in English by Business Insider - he has come out fighting\u201d Draghi: We are well aware of the situation for savers. And it\u2019s not only in Germany that people have to face low interest rates. But interest rates are low because growth is low and inflation is too low. Think about the alternative: if we raised rates now, it would be bad for the economy and we would unleash deflation, unemployment and recession. The interest on savings comes from growth, so the interest of savers is that inflation stabilises and growth becomes more robust. Besides, many savers benefit from low interest rates as they are also homebuyers, taxpayers, entrepreneurs and workers whose companies are benefiting. BILD: In Germany the adverse effects are predominant. Making provision for retirement is becoming increasingly difficult\u2026 Draghi: Remember, what counts is what you earn on savings in real terms, i.e. interest minus inflation. This is higher today than it was in the 1990s. At that time you might have had a higher interest rate on your Sparbuch, but we often had an inflation rate that was higher still. So you could buy less with the money you received. Moreover, people can influence how much they get on their savings even in times of low interest rates. They don\u2019t just have to keep the money in savings accounts but can invest in other ways. The Bundesbank has recently shown that the average return on all German household assets is close to 2%. BILD: So, are the German savers themselves to blame? Draghi: No. But there are alternatives in investing savings. In the United States savers had to face seven years of zero interest rates. Banks, insurers, the financial system nevertheless still worked. Money was invested in a variety of ways which in the end enabled a decent return. He also said he did not take the criticism from the likes of Sch\u00e4uble personally but added: One thing is clear: the ECB obeys the law, not the politicians. Or, as one of my predecessors put it, it is normal for politicians to comment on our actions. But it would be abnormal if we listened to them. And he defended the ECB policies, saying they were working: But we must be patient; investor confidence has not yet been fully restored. For two years, the economy in the euro area has been growing month by month, banks are lending and unemployment is steadily falling,. Meanwhile, euro area countries are now able to buy more German exports again, which, for German companies, is partly making up for the decline in trade with China. But it is a slow process because the crisis was more severe than anything we had since the Second World War. As to when interest rates would rise, he said: Quite simple: when the economy is growing more strongly again and inflation rises closer to our objective. Low interest rates today will lead to higher rates tomorrow. And he said the majority of governments were acting on the necessary reforms \u201calbeit too slowly for my personal taste. All of them would be well advised to do more. But that is not primarily dependent on the ECB and its policies.\u201d The US Treasury secretary undersecretary for international affairs, Nathan Sheets, has been speaking to a House financial committee, and made some comments on the situation in Greece. Reuters reports: [He] said that Greece would not have access to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s exceptional lending facilities in the next phase of its bailout, adding that the Treasury supports the IMF\u2019s insistence that the bailout be restructured to make Greece\u2019s debt sustainable with more reforms from Athens and debt relief from European lenders. David Morrison, senior market strategist at SpreadCo said: The latest crude inventories from the EIA showed a build of 2 million barrels last week... Crude fell sharply on the news. Yesterday the American Petroleum Institute reported a draw of nearly 1.1 million barrels in US inventories last week. Oil soared on the news as analysts had expected a build of 2.4 million barrels. Both WTI and Brent are trading at their best levels since November last year. The trigger for the latest leg of this rally was talk of an output freeze by OPEC and non-OPEC producers. But all hopes for a deal collapsed ten days ago in Doha amid general recriminations. Nevertheless, crude has continued to push higher as analysts predict that supply and demand will come into balance earlier than previously calculated. But it may become more difficult for crude to push on much higher from here. As $50 per barrel becomes a possibility, we should see mothballed US shale production come back on line. On top of that producers will sell forward contracts to lock in prices. US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week, up by 2m barrels to 540.6m barrels. Analysts had expected an increase of around 1.75m barrels, and the US Energy Information Administration said: \u201cUS crude oil inventories are at historically high levels for this time of year.\u201d The rise in crude stocks - a sign of slowing demand - has seen the oil price come off its best levels. Brent, which was up 2% before the data - is now 0.85% higher at $46.13. More data for the US Federal Reserve to contemplate as they meet to discuss their latest views on interest rates and the economy. Home sales rose by more than expected in March, according to the National Association of Realtors. Its pending home sales index climbed 1.4% month on month to 110.5, the highest level since last May and better than the 0.5% increase expected. Lawrence Yun, the association\u2019s chief economist, said: Despite supply deficiencies in plenty of areas, contract activity was fairly strong in a majority of markets in March. This spring\u2019s surprisingly low mortgage rates are easing some of the affordability pressures potential buyers are experiencing and are taking away some of the sting from home prices that are still rising too fast and above wage growth. The association added: In the short-term, the healthy labor market and favorable borrowing costs should lead to sustained buyer demand and a durable pace of sales. However, Yun says the consequences from a failure to construct more single-family homes in recent years are starting to impact some top job producing markets, where endless supply shortages continue to limit choices for buyers and are driving up prices beyond what a growing share of households can comfortably afford. \u201cDemand is starting to weaken in some areas, particularly in the West, where the median home price has risen an astonishing 38 percent in the past three years,\u201d adds Yun. \u201cAs a result, pending sales in the region have now declined in four of the last five months and are lower than one year ago for the third month in a row. Closed sales in the region in March were also below last year\u2019s pace.\u201d Apple is currently the biggest faller in the Dow Jones Industrial Average: Despite European markets holding onto to their - slight - gains, Wall Street is slipping lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 20 points or 0.11% while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.22% at the open and Nasdaq 0.66%. Apple has dropped nearly 8% after it reported its first quarterly revenue fall for 13 years, Twitter is down more, falling 15.7% following its figures. And here (in Greek) is the call from Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras for a European summit. Here\u2019s the statement from European Council president Donald Tusk: Buckle up, folks, the Greek debt crisis is roaring back over the horizon. Relations between Athens and its lenders have hit their worst level since last summer, when the 3rd Greek bailout deal was finally agreed. The two side simply can\u2019t reach a deal over the various \u2018emergency measures\u2019 that would kick in if (or perhaps when) it misses the economic targets in its bailout. This is now causing a cash crunch in Greece, forcing the government to tap various state bodies for spare funds. And there\u2019s serious chatter that we could be looking at fresh elections, or even another referendum, soon. So what\u2019s happened today? So far.... Greece\u2019s prime minister has proposed a meeting of EU leaders to discuss the crisis, but with little success. European Council president Donald Tusk has argued that finance ministers need to make more progress, and hold a eurogroup meeting very soon. Greece is refusing to accept extra austerity and blaming its creditors, as Reuters explains: Greece accused the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday of undermining efforts to broker an accord over its funding options, after talks on a review to unlock fresh bailout aid stalled. Athens would be willing to discuss the introduction of a mechanism to automatically cut spending, Government Spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili said. Greece could not go beyond that, she said. One of Greece\u2019s familiar allies, Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, has offered prime minister Alexis Tsipras some support. He agrees that it\u2019s wrong to push Athens to sign up to further cuts, on top of the measure already agreed. Financial traders are concerned, dumping Greek bonds and thus driving the yield on Greek debt higher into the danger zone: The Greek stock market was hit too: Technical talks are still continuing between officials in Greece, in the hope of a breakthrough. But anyone who lived through last year\u2019s drama will understand that progress could be limited.... Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s UK slowdown: There are some interesting developments around BHS today. First up, Sky\u2019s Mark Kleinman reports that the stricken high street retailer received a demand for \u00a32.6m in unpaid VAT last week, shortly before it fell into administration. Another \u00a310m was due by 30 June, to cover the sale of its Oxford Street store, perhaps explaining the timing of its collapse. And more surprisingly, BHS\u2019s most recent owner is apparently planning to buy the company back! Former racing driver Dominic Chappell, whose reputation has been rather savaged in recent days, has told the Evening Standard that he is meeting potential backers in America right now. He\u2019s hoping to come back with a \u201creal deal\u201d to save as many jobs as possible. Good news? Probably not, given Chappell\u2019s failure to keep the company on the road. A BHS spokesman has already said the idea is \u201cpure fantasy\u201d. Care to guess the fastest growing area of the UK economy in the last 25 years? Royal Bank of Scotland have crunched the numbers, and report that management consulting and head office activities have swelled by 500% since 1990* *- A vintage year, including the Italian World Cup, the end of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s premiership, and the Stone Roses playing Spike Island. But while consultancy has been booming, manufacturing and mining has been steadily declining, they show: There\u2019s little cheer in the City today about the latest UK growth figures. The blue-chip FTSE 100 has dropped by 12 points today to 6272 points, with supermarket chain Tesco shedding 4%. Mining shares, a handy bellwether for global economic confidence, are down around 2% too. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says traders are nervous ahead of tonight\u2019s meeting of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, and may sound cautious about growth prospects [we get US GDP data tomorrow] It\u2019s politically convenient for George Osborne to blame June\u2019s EU referendum for weakness in the UK economy. But economists are warning that the problems run deeper. Scott Corfe of the Centre for Economics and Business Research says Osborne\u2019s growth forecasts are simply too optimistic. Here\u2019s why: Firstly, the consumer economy is coming off the boil. Retail sales volumes have fallen for two consecutive months on the latest ONS data. Rising inflation later this year and into 2017 will take further steam out of the household-led recovery, as will signs of a softening in the labour market with some high profile companies announcing job cuts in recent weeks. The UK\u00b4s international trade position is also a major concern. The current account data released last month showed a record high deficit of 7% of GDP at the end of last year - now greater than the fiscal deficit. Essentially, the country\u2019s poor position on exports and overseas investments means that the UK is now borrowing a huge sum of money from the rest of the world each year. Unless financial markets respond to this and sterling sharply depreciates it is hard to see this being resolved anytime soon. The introduction of the National Living Wage will also lead to job losses, he adds, while efforts to rein in the buy-to-let market may also harm consumer confidence, Corfe continues. Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, agrees that Osborne must take the blame: \u201cBrexit anxiety could certainly be behind some of the slowdown in GDP growth, but the truth is the recovery remains lacklustre. Growth has failed to return to the pre-crisis trend on a sustained basis, and the government\u2019s excessively tight fiscal policy is largely at fault. \u201cOn top of that, wage growth is anaemic and the labour market appears to be slowing down, meaning the macro outlook is as uncertain as it has been for years. More gloom: In another worrying sign, UK retail sales have fallen at the fastest rate in four years. The CBI reports that the recent cold weather hurt demand for clothes, footwear and leather good this month. Sales also fell at department stores; bad news for the high street as it reels from the collapse of BHS and Austin Reed this week. 22% of retailers interviewed by the CBI said that sales volumes were up in April compared to a year ago, whilst 36% said they were down, giving a rounded balance of -13%. That\u2019s the weakest since January 2012. CBI director of economics, Rain Newton-Smith, said: \u201cCold weather put a chill in sales of spring and summer ranges with a reported dip in retail sales in the year to April. But with the near-term outlook for household spending holding up the sector expects a modest rise in sales next month. OECD chief \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda is now warning reporters in London that the is \u201cno economic upside\u201d for the UK outside the EU. It\u2019s \u201cdelusional\u201d to claim that Brexit would give Britain a stronger trading position, Gurr\u00eda adds, warning that some firms would quit the UK. And in an alarming development, the 65-year old Gurr\u00eda has revealed his full commitment to togetherness.... The OECD has now joined the chorus of international bodies arguing against Brexit, claiming it will hit us in the pocket. My colleague Larry Elliott reports: The west\u2019s leading economics thinktank has warned that a British decision to leave the EU in this summer\u2019s referendum would cost each household \u00a32,200 by the end of a decade and continue to impose \u201ca persistent and rising shock\u201d on the UK in the following years. Adding its voice to negative assessments by the Treasury and the International Monetary Fund, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said a so-called Brexit vote on 23 June would provide a major negative shock to Britain and have ripple effects on the rest of Europe. \u201cIn some respects, Brexit would be akin to a tax on GDP, imposing a persistent and rising cost on the economy that would not be incurred if the UK remained in the EU,\u201d the OECD said. Full story: Britain\u2019s economy has hit a \u2018soft patch\u2019, warns John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC. He blames: ...heightened uncertainties about the global economy at the start of the year, which hit the export-oriented manufacturing sector and also took the wind out of the sails of the key business and financial services sector, where growth slowed from 0.7% in the final quarter of 2015 to just 0.3% in the first quarter of 2016. Brexit uncertainty isn\u2019t helping. \u201cUncertainty about the EU referendum outcome may also have had an impact from late February onwards as it became clear there would be an early vote in June. This may have led to some delay in major investment decisions, as indicated by weak construction output in the first quarter. Hawksworth hopes, though, that growth will rebound later in the year: Today\u2019s report shows that growth in the business services and finance slowed to +0.3%, from +0.7% in the last quarter of 2013. This is the main reason that total Services growth slowed from 0.8% to 0.6%, the ONS says. That backs up the theory that stock market turbulence hurt growth. It may also indicate nervousness about the EU referendum, though, as many City firms oppose Brexit. In the production sector, mining and quarrying output shrank by 2.2%, while manufacturing decreasing by 0.4% And Britain\u2019s total economy is now 7.3% higher than before the financial crisis - making it the third best-performing G7 economy. Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, questions whether Brexit is really to blame: The effects of global financial market volatility, stuttering world trade growth and challenges on the high street feel like more obvious explanations for the slowdown. Still, referendum wobbles could make themselves felt in the coming months, highlighting the continuing downside risks for the economy this year\u201d Here\u2019s Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s official response to the news that Britain\u2019s economy is slowing.... \u201cIt\u2019s good news that Britain continues to grow, but there are warnings today that the threat of leaving the EU is weighing on our economy. \u201cInvestments \u200eand building are being delayed, and another group of international experts, the OECD, confirms British families would be worse off if we leave the EU. \u201cLet\u2019s not put the strong economy we\u2019re building at risk, and vote to Remain on June 23.\u201d Reminder: the OECD report is due out at 10.30 BST, but the group has already called Brexit a \u2018bad decision\u2019 this morning. James Knightley of ING Bank fears that growth is continuing to weaken in the run-up to June\u2019s referendum. He says: We suspect that second-quarter GDP growth will be even weaker given the threat of Brexit is negatively impacting business sentiment, leading to a reduction in risks appetite regarding hiring and investment decisions. Indeed, unemployment actually rose in the three months to February while consumer confidence is also coming under pressure. City economist Alan Clarke, of Scotiabank, reckons we can\u2019t blame Brexit fears for the economic slowdown, yet.... Instead, he argues that the financial market turbulence at the start of 2016 hurt confidence. That is not to say that Brexit uncertainty won\u2019t have an impact on GDP growth \u2013 it will. However, this is likely to be visible via reduced investment and hiring and will show up in Q2 GDP. The first estimate of that will come out in late-July \u2013 a month after the actual vote. For now, 0.4% q/q isn\u2019t terrible \u2013 it could have been worse As predicted, the chancellor has claimed that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s EU membership is hurting the economy: ONS chief economist Joe Grice says: \u201cToday\u2019s figures suggest growth has slowed as compared with the pace up to the middle of last year. Services continue to underpin the economy but other sectors have shown falling output this quarter. That\u2019s a blow to hopes of rebalancing the UK economy, as manufacturing, construction and agriculture are still smaller than before the financial crisis. Britain\u2019s service sector was the only part of the economy to grow in the last quarter! Manufacturing, building and farming all contracted, leaving the UK even more reliant on the already dominant service sector. Here\u2019s the details: Services output rose by 0.6%, (corrected) industrial production shank by 0.4% Construction contracted by 0.9% Agriculture by 0.1%. Breaking: UK economic growth has slowed to 0.4% in the first three months of this year. That\u2019s a sharp slowdown, compared to the 0.6% recorded between October and December last year. More to follow.... CNBC also predicts that Brexit fears are weighing on UK growth: The UK economy is expected to post a sharp slowdown in growth in the first quarter amid concerns that a forthcoming vote on the country\u2019s membership of the European Union is scaring investors and industry. Market analysts believe that preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) estimates released on Wednesday morning will show a slowdown in the first quarter to 0.4 percent, down from 0.6 percent in the previous quarter. Some analysts, such as those from Barclays and Pantheon Macroeconomics, thought the slowdown could be more pronounced, however, to 0.3%. The anticipated slowdown has been attributed by all analysts to the \u201cincreasing EU referendum risk,\u201d as Barclays\u2019 analysts said in a note on Wednesday, and fears of a so-called \u201cBrexit\u201d should U.K. voters elect to leave the EU when a referendum is held on June 23. Shares in Barclays have jumped almost 4% to the top of the London stock market leaderboard. Although Barclays posted a 33% drop in pre-tax profits this morning, traders are encouraged that the bank has received approaches for its African business (former CEO Bob Diamond is interested, for starters) Here\u2019s what City economists are saying about this morning\u2019s growth figures, due in an hour\u2019s time. Howard Archer of IHS Global insight, predicts EU referendum fears will knock back growth to 0.3% for the first quarter (down from 0.6%) \u201cIn particular, this is expected to weigh down on business investment and employment, and it may well also limit consumers\u2019 willingness to splash out on big-ticket items. Muted global growth and recent financial market volatility will also hamper UK economic activity in the near term at least.\u201d Tony Cross of Trustnet believes City investors will take the news calmly: We\u2019ve got UK GDP data later this morning and with the Brexit effect having been seen in other Q1 metrics, this is likely to reflect badly on the headline figures but the market may well be willing to overlook any wobbles here, given the evolving sentiment. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has become the latest international body to warn Britain against leaving the EU. They are publishing a new Brexit report this morning, but OECD chief \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda has broken his own embargo and spilled the beans on the Today Programme. Gurr\u00eda declared that \u201cBrexit is a tax\u201d, effectively costing us all one month\u2019s salary by the end of the decade. In the end we come out saying \u201cWhy are we spending so much time, so much effort, so much talent, trying to find ways to compensate for a bad decision that you don\u2019t have to take. Gurr\u00eda added that Britain won\u2019t get a better deal on trade or migration if it leaves the EU - a claim Out campaigns would obviously dispute. We\u2019ll have more details at 10.30am BST. After the embargo lifts, \u00c1ngel..... If today\u2019s growth figures are bad, you can expect George Osborne to blame Brexit fears. The chancellor has already been warning that economic confidence has been hurt by the upcoming EU referendum (his party\u2019s bright idea, let\u2019s not forget). Sky News\u2019s Faisal Islam predicts that Osborne will stick to this message: Chancellor George Osborne is set to repeat his argument that the EU referendum is already weighing down the UK economy. The key measure of economic growth - the GDP figure for the first three months of this year - will be released later today. It is expected to be markedly down from the last quarter of 2015. A slowdown from the 0.6% growth registered in Q4 in 2015 has been anticipated by both the Bank of England and independent economists. GDP growth is expected to have slipped to 0.4% in Q1 of 2016..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re about to get a fresh healthcheck on the UK economy, and the results may not be too pretty. Britain\u2019s growth is expected to have slowed pretty sharply in the last three months, from 0.6% to 0.4%, or possibly even worse. Weakness in the global economy is partly to blame, such as the slowdown in China\u2019s economy. The turmoil that gripped the stock markets in January and early February may also have had an impact on confidence, spending and investment. Domestic issues are another factor; how much damage has the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s EU referendum caused? We find out at 9.30am BST. Also coming up today: Stock markets are expected to fall back this morning, with the FTSE 100 called down 18 points. Tech stocks may be under pressure, after Apple posted its first drop in sales since 2003 - sending its shares down 8% in after-hours trading. It\u2019s a big day for UK corporate results, including Barclays bank, shopping chain Home Retail Group, and estate agent Foxtons. And the eurozone debt crisis is bubbling up again. Overnight, there are reports that Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is seeking an emergency summit to discuss his bailout deal after talks between creditors over reform measures floundered. And with Spanish voters heading back to the polls in June, we could be facing another summer of European drama....",

A better explanation is that the sluggishness of US growth is part of a global trend, in which all the major economies are expanding more weakly than they were in the middle of last year. That\u2019s the story for China, the eurozone, Japan and the UK. Each quarter, the data company Markit compiles a global Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for JP Morgan, with the intention of providing an up-to-date picture of economic conditions. The result for the first three months of 2016 showed activity at its lowest level in more than three years. Nor is there much hint of an improvement in the near future. In the US, firms are hacking back at investment \u2013 normally the sign of a looming recession. Consumer confidence has weakened, in part because real incomes are being squeezed. As export-driven economies, Japan and the eurozone rely on a thriving US to buy their goods, so it is no surprise to find both struggling. The Bank of Japan will be forced to revisit its decision not to provide additional stimulus, since the upshot of its inaction has been a sharp rise in the yen, which will lead to even slower growth. Mario Draghi may again have to lock horns with the Bundesbank president, Jens Weidmann, in order to force through measures aimed at boosting activity in Europe. But the law of diminishing returns is at work. Each cut in interest rates, each fresh dollop of quantitative easing, has less of an impact than the last. The global economy is running out of steam and the conventional weapons are increasingly ineffective. This is not about blizzards shutting factories in Michigan. It goes much deeper than that.",

Even Forbes Magazine got in on the act, saying it would be <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/07/24/sajid-javid-the-next-prime-minister-of-great-britain/#50dc0857a0cd\">a cheering rags-to-riches story if Javid got the keys to Number 10</a>.</p> <p>But his hopes of a glittering career are now tightly bound with the future of Britain\u2019s steel industry. Today\u2019s session showed us that:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/28/sajid-javid-mps-steel-crisis-japan-markets-us-gdp-greece-live?page=with:block-5721dd63e4b09a82af148641#block-5721dd63e4b09a82af148641\"><strong>1) Javid regrets that fateful trip to Australia.</strong> </a></h2> <p>He freely admitted that, with hindsight, he should have flown to Mumbai last month as Tata\u2019s board decided what to do with its UK steel plants.</p> <p>He also insists it wouldn\u2019t have done any good, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/28/sajid-javid-mps-steel-crisis-japan-markets-us-gdp-greece-live?page=with:block-5721d939e4b02c55b640131f#block-5721d939e4b02c55b640131f\">his department has been working behind the scenes since February</a>. But we\u2019ll never know if Tata might have softened the tone of its announcement, if Javid had been banging on the boardroom door promising to do whatever it took to keep the mills running. <br></p> <p>Javid failed to shake off the impression that the government was caught out by Tata\u2019s decision - suggesting it didn\u2019t actually have a full grip on the crisis.</p> <p>And if Port Talbot closes, Javid may go down in political history as the man who took his teenage daughter on a jolly to Australia as the steel industry burned. Harsh game, politics.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/28/sajid-javid-mps-steel-crisis-japan-markets-us-gdp-greece-live?page=with:block-5721e47fe4b0ba980af17021#block-5721e47fe4b0ba980af17021\">2) It\u2019s all about the pensions.</a></strong> </h2> <p>Javid agreed with Tata\u2019s Steel UK SEO Bimlendra Jha that the pension liabilities are crucial.</p> <p>Several potential buyers have already said they wouldn\u2019t take them on, so Tata and the government need to find a way of resolving the \u00a315bn scheme, and its deficit.</p> <p>Javid claims that Tata\u2019s pension scheme is not a \u2018major risk\u2019 to taxpayers.

                "bodyText":"It\u2019s been a packed day of frustrated shareholders and gloomy economic news. Before we go here\u2019s a summary of the main business stories: There have been widespread moves to oppose executive pay deals, including the majority of investors at Shire pharmaceuticals failing to support a 25% rise for its chief executive There was a big upset at the AGM of engineering group Weir with a 72% vote against a proposed remuneration policy At the Schroders AGM, shareholders registered their frustration with the elevation of former chief executive Michael Dobson to chairman. There was also a protest over pay at FTSE 100 building materials business CRH\u2019s AGM In a seemingly pre-emptive move ahead of WPP\u2019s own AGM in June, boss Sir Martin Sorrell has been out and about defending his bumper \u00a370m pay package In other company news, bailed out bank RBS has admitted further delays in offloading 300 Williams &amp; Glyn branches Business secretary Sajid Javid was quizzed by parliament\u2019s BIS committee about Britain\u2019s steel industry, where he said admitted that, with hindsight, he should have flown to Mumbai last month as Tata\u2019s board decided what to do with its UK steel plants. Tata Steel UK\u2019s CEO Bimlendra Jha, also before the BIS committee today, told MPs there would be \u201cvery bad consequences for the taxpayer\u201d if the pension liabilities of almost \u00a315bn facing the business are not dealt with. In economic news, the US suffered a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the opening quarter of this year In the UK, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has noted signs of a slowdown amid jitters around June\u2019s referendum on EU membership. Meanwhile an economists for Brexit report claimed output would be higher, the City would thrive, the trade deficit would be smaller and unemployment lower outside the EU In US company news, Shrek is coming under the same roof as Gru after after confirmation from Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal that it has lined up a $3.8bn deal to buy DreamWorks Animation After UK retailer BHS collapsed into administration on Monday Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell face being hauled in front of MPs to explain their management of the company The person who put forward Sir Philip Green for a knighthood has said he should be stripped of the honour if his handling of BHS is found to have lacked integrity Stock markets had a weak start on disappointment over the lack of fresh stimulus from the Bank of Japan And finally, as jitters return over Greece\u2019s bailout deal, reports from Brussels suggest Athens and its international lenders are almost in full agreement on a package of reforms. But a set of contingency steps requested by eurozone ministers last Friday still needs work, a top EU official tells Reuters. Phew! And now it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Following the upset at Weir\u2019s AGM, the engineering company\u2019s chairman, Charles Berry, has issued a statement (which, in a sign they are not letting earlier hopes go, contains quite a lot of \u201cwould haves\u201d). Here\u2019s an extract from the statement (with my bolding up of some key points): \u201cThe Board are pleased that shareholders have endorsed the vast majority of resolutions at today\u2019s Annual General Meeting. The Group\u2019s resolution on the Directors\u2019 Remuneration Policy did not gain sufficient support and will not now proceed. During an extensive consultation period, the Board had tried to forge a consensus between different shareholder views. \u201cThe Group\u2019s proposed policy would have offered senior management greater stability through the introduction of restricted stock awards in return for a substantial reduction in the maximum award available to the most senior Executive Director from 250% of salary to 165%. Restricted stock awards do not come with direct performance criteria but closely align senior management incentives with shareholder interests, as their value is dependent on share price performance, with the award taking five years to fully vest. In addition, the Remuneration Committee would have had the power to claw back restricted awards if necessary. \u201cThe policy was designed to ensure fairness and consistency across senior management levels and followed extensive consultation with shareholders, who held a wide range of views. During those discussions there was broad acknowledgement of the issue facing many companies, including Weir, of how to effectively recruit, retain and incentivise senior management, across multiple territories, when market conditions beyond their control remain challenging for a sustained period. \u201cIn Weir\u2019s case, these market conditions have recently included a significant fall in commodity prices as a result of oversupply in mining and oil markets and a slowdown in global economic growth. Given the volatility in end markets, the Group\u2019s Remuneration Committee has highlighted the difficulty in setting meaningful financial performance targets over the three-year period required by the current Long Term Incentive Plan.\u201d \u201cWhile acknowledging the issue faced by the Group, a majority of shareholders were clearly uncomfortable with a new approach which did not follow standard UK practice. However, as the Interim Report by the Investment Association\u2019s Executive Remuneration Working Group recently suggested, standard practice in the UK may not be sufficiently flexible and companies should be allowed \u2018to propose the remuneration structure that is in their judgement most appropriate\u2019 including consideration of the introduction of restricted stock.\u201d Some late, breaking AGM news now and the shareholder spring is in full flow with a big upset for engineering group Weir. There was a 72.4% vote against Weir\u2019s remuneration policy. The Glasgow engineer had two votes on pay, and the policy vote was also going to be subject to close scrutiny given it included a share award which was not linked to performance. Weir had argued it had used this policy for US directors and said the pay for the chief executive was down last year. Ahead of the vote, Hermes, representing pension funds, had said: \u201cWe are recommending to clients that they vote against, due to the proposed award of restricted shares which are not tied to performance targets.\u201d So it\u2019s back to the drawing board for Weir. On financial markets, London shares have managed to claw back some ground this afternoon and the FTSE 100 erased early losses to finish virtually unchanged on the day. The London bluechips index is 2.5 points higher at 6,322.40. It had earlier dropped sharply as markets around the world were dragged lower on disappointment at the Japanese central bank\u2019s decision not to come up with any fresh stimulus measures. It\u2019s a similar story of little change on the day across European stock markets with France\u2019s CAC40 index down just 0.3% and Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.1%. Spain\u2019s Ibex has fared worse, down 0.8%. Another FTSE 100 company -building materials business CRH - has also had a protest over pay, this time a binding vote over policy. Jill Treanor reports that just over 40% of shareholders voted against the new pay policy - which covers the next three years - and which increases the chief executive\u2019s pay potential by 50%. CRH, as an Irish incorporate company but listed in London, did not technically have to put its pay policy to a vote. Its remuneration report, which covers pay for 2015, had an 8% vote against. Back to AGM showdowns now and my colleague Julia Kollewe has been at the Schroders AGM today, where shareholders registered their frustration with the elevation of former chief executive Michael Dobson, who ran the investment firm for more than 14 years, to chairman. Julia reports: Nearly 15% voted against Dobson\u2019s re-election, and almost 12% voted against Lord Howard of Penrith, the senior independent director who oversaw the move. Hermes, which represents pension funds and had urged other investors to oppose Dobson\u2019s promotion, voted against both. It is a sizeable protest vote, given that the Schroders family owns 48% of the shares. Some 4% of investors voted against the firm\u2019s remuneration report. At the meeting in London, Lord Howard said the company was aware that it was breaching corporate governance guidelines by making Dobson chairman, but defended his promotion. \u201cWe thought he was such a good and such an obvious candidate,\u201d he said. One of the biggest fund managers in the City, Schroders had consulted its 10 largest investors, and \u201coverall we received considerable, a lot of support\u201d although he admitted that there were \u201csome shareholders who had concerns\u201d. Howard said the company would continue to talk to them. Royal London Asset Management voted against Schroders\u2019 pay policy and the appointment of Dobson as chair. Its corporate governance manager Ashley Hamilton Claxton said: \u201cAlthough Mr Dobson was successful in leading the company as CEO, his appointment as chairman is inappropriate and in clear violation of the corporate governance code.\u201d There have been fresh developments in the BHS story this afternoon. Following the retailer\u2019s collapse into administration on Monday, Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell face being hauled in front of MPs to explain their management of the company after an influential parliamentary committee launched an inquiry into the department store chain. Graham Ruddick reports: The Commons Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) select committee has announced it will explore the sale and acquisition of BHS, including whether the directors of Green\u2019s Arcadia and Retail Acquisitions acted as best they could to fulfil their statutory duties. BHS called in administrators on Monday, putting almost 11,000 jobs at risk. The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 last March to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell. BHS\u2019s collapse has caused controversy because it has been saddled with a \u00a3571m pension deficit despite Green collecting more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership, with Retail Acquisitions receiving payments of more than \u00a325m from BHS over the last 13 months. The full story: In US company news, Disney will have to size up to a formidable rival after confirmation from Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal that it has lined up a $3.8bn deal to buy DreamWorks Animation, maker of hits from Shrek to Kung Fu Panda. The deal will see DreamWorks Animation come under the same roof as NBCUniversal-owned Illumination Entertainment, maker of the hugely profitable Despicable Me films and spin-off Minions. The deal, a healthy premium on DreamWorks Animation\u2019s $2.3bn stock market valuation, is expected to close by the end of the year subject to clearance by competition regulators, reports Mark Sweney. Mark\u2019s full story: Back with the main economic story of the afternoon, the sharp slowdown in US GDP growth in the first quarter, as reported earlier, forms part of a worrying global trend, in the eyes of our economics editor Larry Elliott. Central bankers around the world are getting diminishing returns on their actions and all the major economies are expanding more weakly than they were in the middle of last year. The global economy is running out of steam and the conventional weapons are increasingly ineffective. This is not about blizzards shutting factories in Michigan. It goes much deeper than that,\u201d writes Larry. Here\u2019s the full comment: Sticking with UK news for a moment, Jill Treanor and Julia Kollewe have been following shareholder rebellions over pay today. They have more details on the majority of investors at Shire pharmaceuticals failing to support a 25% pay rise for its chief executive, Flemming \u00d8rnskov. The report continues: The increase in his salary to $1.7m (\u00a31.2m) means \u00d8rnskov\u2019s bonuses are also going up, a move which shareholders had been urged to protest against before the annual meeting on Thursday. The advisory pay vote squeezed through, as holders of 50.5% of the shares in the Dublin-based but London-listed FTSE 100 company voted in favour \u2013 but if deliberate abstentions were included, support for the board fell just below 50%. It builds on the defiant mood in which the AGM season started earlier this month when there were \u201cno votes\u201d at two FTSE 100 companies \u2013 BP and Smith &amp; Nephew \u2013 on the same day. Mining company Anglo American has also faced protests over pay, with more than 40% of investors voting against its remuneration report last week. Jill and Julia\u2019s full story is here: Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been in Stockport this week and talking about the EU referendum again. Growth appears to be slowing ahead of June\u2019s vote, said Carney, who has previously warned that Britain\u2019s economy could struggle to grow after a decision to quit the European Union. The referendum itself posed a significant risk to the economy, the Canadian said. He told the Stockport Express newspaper: \u201cIn the very short term the economy appears to be slowing, probably related to issues around the referendum. One of the responsibilities of the Bank of England is to manage risk and financial stability. \u201cRisks around the referendum are the biggest risks facing the UK economy, we have contingency planning to decrease the potential impacts of uncertainty.\u201d As we reported yesterday, the latest official figures showed UK economic growth slowed markedly in the first quarter of this year to 0.4% from 0.6% in the final three months of 2015. But economists are divided over how much of the slowdown could be blamed on the referendum. The full interview with Carney, including him fessing up to drinking a whole half pint of beer while on duty (gasp!) is here. In other UK news... the business select committee has launched a full inquiry into the collapse of high street chain BHS. They will investigate the sale of the business by Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 last year, what due diligence was done by the buyers, and whether the taxpayer is now on the hook for BHS\u2019s pension bill. Iain Wright MP, committee chair, says: \u201cThe collapse of BHS brings misery and uncertainty for thousands of workers and also places a potentially significant burden on the taxpayer in the form of pension liabilities. The sale and acquisition of BHS raises real questions about whether directors acted in the best long-term interests of the company and their employees. Is there too much of an incentive in the system for owners to asset-strip, take out vast sums for personal gain, and then dump and run leaving the taxpayer to pick up the tab when the company fails, rather than create value for the long-term? Back in the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland has admitted that it will probably fail to sell its Williams &amp; Glyn division by the end of next year. It has just warned that City that it will probably miss a deadline of the end of 2017 to offload more than 300 branches, due to the complexity of separating customers from the rest of RBS. The overall financial impact on RBS is now likely to be significantly greater than previously estimated, it admits. RBS shares have been hit hard, down 4.6%. This is the third year running in which US growth has been alarmingly weak in the January-March quarter. There\u2019s no chance of the US central bank raising interest rates while growth is so weak, argues Tom Floyd of Foenix Partners. According to Floyd, Americans can stop worrying that interest rates might rise in June. Despite the Fed\u2019s best efforts to leave the door open for a hike at the next meeting, today\u2019s GDP data risks blowing it firmly shut. The data, showing a rise of just 0.5% in the first quarter versus expectations of a rise of 0.7%, undermines the more hawkish Fed tone from last night and does little to justify an imminent raise. Although the Fed dropped language acknowledging global risks it is worth noting the next meeting is only 8 days before the next major global risk event, the Brexit vote. In light of the soft data and the looming referendum, a June hike is looking increasingly unlikely with Janet Yellen\u2019s attempts to convince markets to the contrary becoming largely futile. Traders will remain rightly sceptical. Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, is also concerned by the slowdown in US growth: \u201cThe US economy hasn\u2019t run aground by any means, but it is navigating more difficult domestic waters than three months ago. Growth has been weighed down by weak performances in the manufacturing and energy sectors due to the strong dollar and volatile oil prices. On top of this, consumer confidence has been knocked recently, impacting retail sales. \u201cAlthough today\u2019s results clearly indicate a slowdown in growth, it\u2019s important to remember that the US economy has still expanded. The labour market is in reasonably good shape, and global risks seem to be slightly more muted than at the start of the year. This will help support domestic momentum as the year progresses. Paul Sommerville of Sommerville Advisory Markets says an annualised growth rate of 0.5% is \u2018woeful\u2019. This is America\u2019s weakest quarterly growth rate in almost two years: And while consumer spending is up, exports and business spending have fallen - suggesting the US recovery is uneven, as well as weak. Breaking news from America: The US economy has barely grown at all in the last three months. US GDP expanded by 0.5%, on an annualised basis, according to the US commerce department. That\u2019s a quarterly growth rate of just 0.125% - a very measly outcome - and weaker than the 0.4% which Britain reported yesterday. Although consumer spending rose by 1.9%, business investment tumbled by 5.9%, suggesting corporations cut back sharply. Here\u2019s Graham Ruddick\u2019s early story about this morning\u2019s session, in which Tata Steel\u2019s UK boss warned of \u2018disaster\u2019 looming unless a deal is reached. Sajid Javid has been spoken of as a future prime minister. Even Forbes Magazine got in on the act, saying it would be a cheering rags-to-riches story if Javid got the keys to Number 10. But his hopes of a glittering career are now tightly bound with the future of Britain\u2019s steel industry. Today\u2019s session showed us that: 1) Javid regrets that fateful trip to Australia. He freely admitted that, with hindsight, he should have flown to Mumbai last month as Tata\u2019s board decided what to do with its UK steel plants. He also insists it wouldn\u2019t have done any good, as his department has been working behind the scenes since February. But we\u2019ll never know if Tata might have softened the tone of its announcement, if Javid had been banging on the boardroom door promising to do whatever it took to keep the mills running. Javid failed to shake off the impression that the government was caught out by Tata\u2019s decision - suggesting it didn\u2019t actually have a full grip on the crisis. And if Port Talbot closes, Javid may go down in political history as the man who took his teenage daughter on a jolly to Australia as the steel industry burned. Harsh game, politics. 2) It\u2019s all about the pensions. Javid agreed with Tata\u2019s Steel UK SEO Bimlendra Jha that the pension liabilities are crucial. Several potential buyers have already said they wouldn\u2019t take them on, so Tata and the government need to find a way of resolving the \u00a315bn scheme, and its deficit. Javid claims that Tata\u2019s pension scheme is not a \u2018major risk\u2019 to taxpayers. But that\u2019s not the same as saying taxpayers won\u2019t pay a penny.... And don\u2019t forget that Jha warned of economic and social disaster if the pension problem isn\u2019t dealt with... 3) The government won\u2019t own more than 25% of British steel. Javid is committed to taking a 25% stake in Tata UK, if it helps find a buyer. But that\u2019s his limit - anything more would, in his view, be counterproductive. That\u2019s a typically Thatcherite view, and means full nationalisation isn\u2019t on the cards. Q: Finally, what can you do to reassure customers and suppliers to keep working with Tata steel at this time? Sajid Javid says he has already written to all Tata\u2019s customers and suppliers, and contacted the largest ones directly. He has also asked Tata to give similar reassurances. But the biggest comfort I can give is the action that we are prepared to take, and how far we will go to get a deal. That means customers and suppliers can look at this and say \u2018this business has a long-term future\u2019. It\u2019s an ongoing process too - we need to keep reassuring people. Javid concludes the session by insisting that the government is doing everything it can, along with other partners such as the Welsh government and unions. The Community union couldn\u2019t be more helpful if it tried, he concludes. That\u2019s the end of the session. Q: If a potential buyer says it needs nine months to agree a deal, but Tata insist on a quick deal, would you step in with a bridging loan? I\u2019m not going to rule anything out, Javid replies, but the focus is to find a commercial operator quickly. A nine-month process isn\u2019t in anyone\u2019s interest. Q: You have offered to take a 25% stake in Tata UK. Is that your maximum limit? Javid says his offer of 25% co-ownership was designed to show potential buyers that he\u2019s serious about getting a deal. But the 25% figure is important - if you go over that, the government would be a significant shareholder, and too closely involved. Q: How long would you be prepared to hold this stake before looking to exit? Javid says it\u2019s too early to say. Q: Unions have told us they would favour scrapping the lesser duty rule, in favour of a new solution just for the steel sector. Is this under consideration? Javid says he still supports the lesser duty rule [this is the rule that prevents higher tariffs being imposed on Chinese steel] The lesser duty rule works, Javid insists. Its intention is to stop dumping or provide compensation. If we scrapped it, we would have spent an extra \u00a3500m on the solar industry for example [because the lesser duty rule covers a range of industries, not just steel] Q: Do you believe Tata are a responsible seller, given they didn\u2019t fully brief you about their plans for a quick sale? Yes, Javid replies, based on the conversations I\u2019d had with them. They have approached this issue responsibly. Q: Is there timeline appropriate? They are talking about finding a buyer within weeks, but this will take months. Tata are losing money every day, so they can\u2019t have unlimited time. But it is important that they do everything possible to find a responsible buyer. I have every reason to believe that when they promise to be responsible, that will be reflected in the timeline, Javid hints. MPs are questioning whether Sajid Javid is really doing enough to help the steel industry. I will do everything in my power to help, but I cannot influence the price of steel, says Javid Q: But what about tariffs? Should the EU move faster to identify problems? Speed of action is an issue, Javid replies -- that\u2019s why I called a meeting last year to look at the issue of dumping. Europe must move faster. Reminder: Javid actually blocked a measure to impose higher tariffs on Chinese steel imports.... But the business secretary is adamant that tariffs can work. Take wire rod imports - they have gone from 67,000 tonnes to zero. Q: What is your working assumption about the pension liabilities, if there is a successful sale? Javid says commercial sensitivities prevent him saying too much. But several potential buyers have said they wouldn\u2019t be interested if they had to take on Tata\u2019s pension liabilities. It\u2019s a big scheme, with 130,000 members, and it\u2019s relatively expensive. Q: So might the public purse be left \u2018holding the baby\u2019? No, Javid replies. Discussions are already underway to finding a solution. Q: You really don\u2019t think it\u2019s a risk? It\u2019s not a major risk to the public purse, no, Javid insists. Q: What top three lessons can we learn from the Scottish government\u2019s deal to save two Tata steel plants? Javid says it\u2019s hard to learn lessons - given the Scottish plans were steel mills (recycling steel) rather than a blast furnace (which makes new metal). And it only involved 300 jobs. Q: But surely we can learn lessons from Scotland\u2019s speed of response? (they brokered a deal which say Tata sell the site to Liberty House). Javid doesn\u2019t accept that Westminster have been acting too slowly. But we must help workers to keep their skills \u2018fresh\u2019, or reskill if needed. The committee aren\u2019t impressed with Javid\u2019s claims that Britain is getting better at using home-smelted steel for big government contracts. They point out that the Minister for Defence Procurement has admitted he doesn\u2019t have the full records of where it sourced its steel from (details). Javid reiterates that the situation is improving. But we can\u2019t always assume that a UK steelmaker will make the most competitive bid for a project.... Q: Why hasn\u2019t the government moved faster to change procurement rules to use more UK steel in infrastructure projects? Javid says the government needed to ensure the changes were legally watertight. Changes are being made, and they will make a difference. But he accepts that they have not made an impact yet. Javid has been accused of misleading the committee over SSI Redcar, by Labour MP Tom Blenkinsop, who represents Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland. The committee asks why Javid allowed the steel works at Redcar to close last autumn. Q: Why did you rejecting an offer from one company to keep the coke ovens open, and \u201cshut the door rapidly\u201d on negotiations? Javid insists that the Redcar plant didn\u2019t have a viable future, and no serious offers. So given the uncertainty facing workers, he wanted to quickly arrange a package to help them retrain and find new jobs. Committee chairman Iain Wright isn\u2019t impressed, telling the secretary of state that he should have allowed Redcar to be mothballed. Instead, Javid allowed the \u201cabsolute tragedy\u201d of a hard closure. We\u2019ve lost those skills from the steel industry for ever..... And an absolute disgrace that it was allowed to happened on your watch. Q: Anna Soubry says she heard about Tata\u2019s plans via Twitter. You were on the other side of the world - how can you claim you were in control? Javid reiterates that commercial sensitivity stopped the government from saying more. Q: The government has given some very mixed messages - first saying that nationalisation was off the table, but now offering to do whatever it takes. Do you accept you have been on the back foot throughout this crisis? Javid denies this, claiming the government\u2019s message has been consistent despite the pressure not to release commercially sensitive decisions. He points out that minister Anna Soubry didn\u2019t rule out nationalisation, but then adds: Rarely is nationalisation a solution - the best companies are in private hands. Q: You\u2019re doing it again - \u2018rarely\u2019 is not a decisive word. It doesn\u2019t suggest a clear-cut plan to what\u2019s been unfolding. Javid repeats that he is under control. It has taken time for Tata to release info about its own plans, and the government has been reacting and adding its own detail. Javid\u2019s decision to fly to Australia last month, not Mumbai, is particularly sensitive as he also took his teenage daughter along. Q: Businesses complain about the lack of a level playing field, so what can be done to help firms compete with German firms? Javid says that more needs to be done on energy costs -- an issue which Tata UK raised earlier in this session. Some early reaction to Javid\u2019s testimony: Q: If you could turn the clock back a month, would you have attended that meeting in Mumbai rather than going to Australia? Of course, says Sajid Jabid. With the benefit of hindsight, knowing what Tata would say and how it would be reported. But the reality is that he must travel as part of his role as business secretary. Key point: Javid admits he should have attended crunch board meeting in Mumbai. Q: Isn\u2019t the truth that you were blindsided by Tata, which is why you set off to Australia leaving no-one in London who could deal with this crisis? No, Javid insists. Tata is a large global business, so people in every management layer don\u2019t always have all the information about what\u2019s happening. He denies that a better early warning system would have helped. Q: It looked like you were on the back foot after the Mumbai meeting, in panic mode and scrambling around to get the initiative. Javid denied that he should have flown to Mumbai for the board meeting - that would have been far too late. It might have made a great photo opportunity, but it wouldn\u2019t have helped. Instead, our work in the weeks before the meeting were crucial. And the government couldn\u2019t have shared some information because it was legally sensitive - announcing it could have made the situation worse. Q: So when the Tata board met in Mumbai in late March, were you convinced that they had dropped the idea of complete closure and were looking for a buyer? Yes, says Javid. Q: So did Tata mislead you? No, says Javid. But he was surprised by the speed at which Tata was looking to sell up. Q: Frankly, secretary of state, I don\u2019t understand why you weren\u2019t in Mumbai, says Iain Wright. Javid repeats that he had been shocked to learn in February that Port Talbot could close, but he had then begun looking for a buyer. So he was startled by newspaper reports that the board decided to settle the issue \u2018within weeks\u2019 That is not what we agreed with Tata, and that\u2019s not what they are not planning to do. Javid says he went on his (infamous) trade mission to Australia knowing that he could return if needed - as he did. Sajid Javid has arrived, flanked by two senior officials. Iain Wright, BIS committee chair, goes first: Q: You told the House on 11 April that Tata were seriously considering closing Port Talbot. The CEO of Tata UK has questioned that this morning [earlier] - so who actually told you, and when? Javid says that Tata India (so not the UK branch) told him in mid-February that they were considering shutting Port Talbot and focusing on the rest of their UK operations. We then worked intensively to try to persuade Tata to keep funding their operations, and embark on a turnaround plan. But it became clear that the board might not accept that, so we began considering whether an alternative owner could be found instead - and considering what we could do to assist Q: What did you do between mid-February and the Mumbai board meeting at the end of March when the decision to sell up was taken? Javid says he asked the company if there was anything we could do that would prevent them from closing Port Talbot. And the short answer was no. There were things they wanted us to do for the rest of the business - but I kept my focus on saving Port Talbot. So we began considering whether another buyer could be found. Tata is a global producer, not just a UK one, so there may be another company who could take their operations on. Reminder, you can watch today\u2019s hearing here. We should hear from the business secretary in a moment.... That\u2019s the end of the session with Bimlendra Jha, so what did MPs learn from the Tata UK boss? 1) The pension issue is absolutely crucial. No potential buyer is going to buy Port Talbot, and Tata\u2019s other steel plants, without some solution Tata\u2019s pension fund has \u00a315bn of liabilities, and an estimated deficit of under \u00a3500m. The collapse of high street chain BHS showed that pension black holes get bigger when a firm goes under, as potential losses are \u201ccrystallised\u201d. Jha insisted that there are ways of fixing this problem, without using public money; hopefully Sajid Javid can give more details shortly. 2) Tata insists it kept the government in the loop. The \u201cwriting was on the wall all the time\u201d, Jha insists, when quizzed about exactly when it warned the government that the situation was unsustainable. That raises fresh questions about Javid\u2019s decision to fly to Australia as the crisis escalated. 3) Can Port Talbot be saved, in current climate? Jha says there are \u201cserious question marks\u201d over the South Wales plant. And he pinned the blame firmly on high costs, such as energy and business rates, that are making it unprofitable. We would not be selling up if we could make money, he insists. 4) This crisis could still end very badly. As he urged the government to address the pension issue, Jha warned that the stakes are terribly high. It\u2019s not just the four thousand or so workers at Port Talbot, but the \u201ceconomic and social consequences of that kind of disaster\u201d if steel fails. Q: What can be done to remove uncertainty and help solve this crisis? This uncertainty is exactly why we need an accelerated timescale for this sale, says Bimlendra Jha. He may still be bristling from that criticism that Tata want \u2018non-binding\u2019 letters of intent from potential buyers next week). We must remove uncertainty among customers, suppliers and staff. The government have given us letters, which we can use to reassure suppliers, he adds. Q: What happens to Tata UK\u2019s pension liabilities if Port Talbot closes or is sold? The number of contributors goes down by 4,700, Jha replies, so the burden increases and the scheme becomes weaker. Bimlendra Jha then gives MPs a lesson in running a manufacturing giant in the 21st century. UK manufacturing is in decline, and when we hurt ourselves with high energy costs or business rates you hurt the whole industry. And when a firm can easily move over the Channel and buy energy cheaper, the situation quickly worsens. We cannot be the ones who shut the door on the industrial revolution which began in this country, Jha declares, jabbing at his desk. And this chart, from retail commentator Paul Mitchell, shows how rates have gone up and up: Q: We\u2019ve heard a lot about pensions liabilities at BHS this week, but those liabilities would be dwarfed by Tata Steel\u2019s liabilities. What consideration have you taken about potential liabilities to the UK taxpayer? We need to be aware that if this pension fund liability is not taken care of, there is no buyer sitting out there to buy this business, CEO Jha replies. [Tata UK has a pension scheme of around \u00a315bn, and a deficit of around \u00a3485m] If we don\u2019t solve this problem, we are staring at some very bad consequences for the UK taxpayers, Jha continues. It\u2019s not just the Tata Steel workers, it\u2019s the entire supply chain and the entire communities that demand on it. Jha says: I don\u2019t know what arithmetic has been done on the economic and social consequences of that kind of disaster.... Key point: Tata says no buyer for its steel works unless pension fund liability is addressed Q: What about your arithmetic? You bought this business, and you knew about the liabilities at the time... We have kept it funded, Jha interjects Q: But is there a wider issue about businesses walking away from their liabilities? Tata have constantly put money into the pension fund. We have had constant dialogue with our trade union partners. Jha then says Tata has been speaking to the government about finding solutions that would not involve public money or hurt the company. He suggests that a move to a defined contribution scheme, rather than a final salary scheme, would help. Q: Do all communications between Tata and the UK government go through you, Mr Jha? No, replies Jha (who took over as CEO earlier this month) So you can\u2019t be sure that Tata didn\u2019t privately tell the government months ago that it was considering closure (as Sajid Javid told MPs this month). Jha confirms that this is true, but then warns: There are serious question marks about the viability of Port Talbot. Q: Does Tata believe the UK government is open to buying British steel for infrastructure projects? Marc Meyohas of Greybull Capital says the government is open to dialogue on this issue, and it\u2019s crucial that this dialogue delivers results. The government have made it clear they are behind the industry, he says. Q: Anything in writing? Not to us, Meyohas replies. Q: How long have you been talking intensively with the UK government? We have been talking to the government on a daily basis for months, Bimlendra Jha says. There is now also a team from Tata\u2019s in Q: When did you tell the government that the situation was so serious? Jha can\u2019t say exactly when it happened, during the ongoing dialogue over issues such as business rates. Q: When did you decide to pull out of the UK? At the board meeting of 29 March, when the board released that the losses were unsustainable. Q: But the government would have known how serious things were? The writing was on the wall all the time, Jha says. It\u2019s hard to say when the penny drops in someone\u2019s mind, though. Key point: Tata says government was aware of how serious the problems were. The commitee turn to Marc Meyohas of Greybull Capital, which is funding a management buyout of Tata\u2019s site in Scunthorpe. We are confident that the management plan to turn Scunthorpe around will work, says Meyohas. Q: Will it work better than your involvement with Comet (the UK retailer which collapsed in 2012)? We only had a small involvement in Comet, Meyohas insists. There is great sadness that we are leaving the UK, Jha concludes, but we must be responsible to our shareholders too. Q: Is the government doing enough? Tata UK CEO Bimlendra Jha says there is a growing awareness that more needs to be done, such as on energy costs. But there are serious structural weaknesses - Tata UK would not be loss-making if we had Germany\u2019s energy costs. Q: Would you be selling the business if there wasn\u2019t an uneven playing field? We wouldn\u2019t not be selling the business if it wasn\u2019t loss-making, Jha insists. Tata has put in \u00a31.5bn in capital expenditure, and written off \u00a32bn, and hasn\u2019t taken a divident from the UK operations in the last nine years. We have taken all the hit, all the time. Q: What is the timescale for a sale? There is no deaddrop time, but given the losses, urgency is important as we can\u2019t continue to bleed money. Q: Can you guarantee that you will keep the UK operations running until a buyer is found to save jobs? We cannot give any such commitment Q: So do you have an internal deadline? Jha insists that Tata is a responsible seller, however... What if no buyer emerges? We cannot continue to bleed. Iain Wright asks why Tata has asked potential buyers to submit offers by next week. Why is the timescale so short? Our world reknown advisors believe this is a liberal timescale compared to what administrators would do, says Bimlendra Jha. Iain Wright, committee chairman, begins by asking Bimlendra Jha when Tata first began considering closing its UK steel operations rather than selling it. We haven\u2019t said we are planning to close it, Jha replies. But the secretary of state told Parliament he was told privately several weeks ago that Tata was considering immediate closure, Wright says. Our board meeting only decided to exit the UK, Jha says. Wright asks if Tata intimated to the government that you might simply close the sites? No. Jha insists. There is a very difficult business case to continue with Port Talbot. Therefore, we must find a buyer who can make the whole UK strip system work - both Port Talbot, and the downstream operations. The hearing on the Steel Industry is starting now, the Grimond Room of the House of Commons. The first witnesses are Bimlendra Jha, CEO of Tata Steel UK, and Marc Meyohas, partner of Greybull Capital. You can watch it live here. A month ago, the crisis in Britain\u2019s steel industry appeared to be career-defining for Sajid Javid. Not in a good way, either. Famously, the business secretary jetted off to a trip to Australia just as Tata\u2019s board took the momentous decision to sell all its UK operations. He was then dragged back to Britain (with a non-too-impressed teenage daughter in tow), and only reached Port Talbot on April 1 three days after the story broke. Over the last month, Javid should have had his head down helping to find a buyer for Tata\u2019s UK steelworkers and save around 40,000 jobs. Last week, he announced that the government would provide hundreds of millions of pounds in state support, such as loans and grants, and possibly even an equity stake. Today\u2019s steel hearing comes two days after prime minister David Cameron visited Tata\u2019s main blast furnace on the south coast of Wales: The Press Association explains: Prime Minister David Cameron visited the Tata Steel works in Port Talbot, South Wales, on Tuesday to assure workers, unions and bosses of the Government\u2019s commitment to support the future of steel-making at the under-threat plant. Unions welcomed the recent offer of state support for potential buyers, but stressed that any action must cover plants across the whole country and not just in Wales. Mr Rickhuss said the Prime Minister had \u201clooked proud steelworkers in the eye and promised to do all he could to protect their jobs\u201d, and said his union would \u201chold him at his word\u201d. European stock markets have been dragged down by disappointment that the Bank of Japan didn\u2019t unleash more stimulus today. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 40 points or 0.6%, and there are similar losses in Paris and Frankfurt. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says: London equities have been rattled in early trade with the shock news that the Bank of Japan offered no further stimulus being seen as a key factor in driving sentiment. Britain\u2019s investors have a great chance to protest against excessive boardroom pay today. No fewer than 26 companies are holding annual general meetings today, and there could be revolts against remuneration policies at several major companies including drugs firm Shire Pharmaceuticals, and engineering group Weir. My colleague Jill Treanor explains: The votes on pay at Shire Pharmaceuticals, CRH (a building materials business) and Weir are expected to be tight, especially at Shire \u2013 where chief executive Flemming \u00d8rnskov is receiving a 25% rise in his salary to $1.7m (\u00a31.2m). Investors in Japan are nursing heavy losses today after the country\u2019s central bank defied expectations of yet more stimulus measures. The main Japanese stock index, the Nikkei, has slumped by 3.6% and the yen has soared against the US dollar. All because the Bank of Japan left its (already sizeable) stimulus programme unchanged at today\u2019s policy meeting. Economists had been expecting another big move - further rate cuts and yet more electronic money-printing, to try and get Japan\u2019s growth and inflation rate up. So, bad news for plucky investors. But perhaps a victory for those who argue monetary policy shouldn\u2019t be the only tool fighting the economic malaise. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The future of Britain\u2019s steel industry is under scrutiny today, as MPs investigate efforts to save tens of thousands of jobs at Tata\u2019s operations across the UK. Business secretary Sajid Javid will be quizzed about the government\u2019s plans this morning, at 10.30am. Before that, the BIS select committee will also hear from Bimlendra Jha, chief executive of Tata and Marc Meyohas of Greybull Capital, which is buying Tata\u2019s plant at Scunthorpe. MPs are presumably going to ask how the UK steel industry reached this plight, the issue of Chinese steel dumping, and the government\u2019s offer to partly nationalise the sites. They should also probe reports that Tata might actually keep the sites, a month after shocking Britain by putting them up for sale. Here\u2019s the key timings: At 9.10am Bimlendra Jha, CEO, Tata Steel UK Marc Meyohas, Partner, Greybull Capital LLP At 9.50am Fergus Ewing MSP, Minister for Business, Energy and Tourism Edwina Hart AM, Minister for Economy, Science and Transport Tom Blenkinsop MP, Chair, All Party Parliamentary Group for the Steel and Metal Related Industry Gareth Stace, Director, UK Steel Roy Rickhuss, General Secretary of Community and Chair of the National Trade Union Steel Coordinating Committee At 10.30am The Rt Hon Sajid Javid MP, Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills Niall McKenzie, Director, Infrastructure &amp; Materials, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills Anthony Odgers, Deputy Chief Executive and Director, Corporate Finance UK Government Investments Also coming up today.... At 1.30pm, we find out how the US economy fared in the last quarter. Economists expect a sharp slowdown, to a quarterly rate of just 0.15%. That would make Britain\u2019s slowdown, to 0.4%, look quite decent - and would also fuel concerns that the global economy is weakening. In the City, Lloyds bank is reporting financial results. And the Greek bailout crisis is also rumbling on. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is due to speak to European Council President Donald Tusk today, after Tusk rejected his call on Wednesday for a leaders\u2019 summit to discuss Greece\u2019s bailout talks. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Market research firm GfK said its consumer sentiment indicator for April was the weakest for 15 months as households became gloomier about the UK\u2019s economic outlook. The index dropped to -3 from a March reading of 0, when GfK also claimed referendum jitters had hit consumer confidence. The latest survey of 2,000 people conducted in the first two weeks of April showed confidence dropped in all the areas measured: their personal financial situation, their view of the UK economy and whether now was a good time to make big purchases. The report\u2019s compilers linked the gloomier picture to discussions around how the UK economy would fare outside the EU in the event of a vote to leave. They also cited renewed signs of political and financial turmoil in the eurozone over Greece\u2019s troubled bailout programme. \u201cMixed messages about a post-Brexit world and the ongoing eurozone crisis are casting a cloud over our economy,\u201d said Joe Staton of GfK. \u201cThe biggest dent to confidence comes from consumers\u2019 depression [concerns] about the general economic situation in the UK for the next year, dropping 20 points in 12 months.

Official statistics showed GDP in the 19-nation eurozone rose 0.6% in the first quarter despite a backdrop of turmoil on global markets at the start of the year. It was the fastest growth for a year and twice the pace recorded in the closing quarter of 2015. GDP was up 1.6% on a year earlier. The quarterly performance beat growth in the UK, which reported a slowdown to 0.4% GDP expansion earlier this week and also outperformed the world\u2019s biggest economy, the US. The eurozone reading was better than economists had been expecting, with a Reuters poll before the release pointing to 0.4% growth. But some experts warned that the single currency region could have a tougher second quarter and that the first quarter figures could yet be revised lower when more information comes in. Other data from EU statistics office Eurostat showed that inflation in the eurozone dropped to -0.2% in April, compared with zero inflation in March. The early estimate for April showed energy prices were the biggest drag on inflation, falling by an estimated 8.6% on the year. The April reading marks the second dip below zero for eurozone inflation this year and follows a warning last week from ECB chief Mario Draghi that inflation could turn negative again in coming months. The ECB has been criticised by Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who claimed record low interest rates were causing \u201cextraordinary problems\u201d for German banks and pensioners and risked fuelling the rise of anti-EU sentiment in Germany. But Draghi has sought to stress that loose policy was needed to get inflation back to the central bank\u2019s target of \u201cbelow but close to\u201d 2%. Policymakers will take some comfort from the GDP figures, however. The pick-up in growth for the eurozone region follows news earlier on Friday that the French economy expanded a faster-than-expected 0.5% in the first quarter on the back of a big jump in consumer spending. The first quarter performance marked the fastest growth for a year and compared with 0.3% in the previous three months. Austria\u2019s economy also beat market forecasts with first quarter growth of 0.4% and Spain grew a solid 0.8%, matching the previous three months. Separate Eurostat figures showed unemployment in the eurozone fell to 10.2% in March from 10.4% in February. There were parallels between the lower unemployment rates and faster GDP growth for the eurozone, said Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING bank. \u201cDomestic strength in the eurozone economy is key to current economic growth. This is mostly because of improvements in the job market. In March, unemployment declined by more than 200,000 people in the eurozone,\u201d said Colijn. But he added a word of warning about the GDP figures: \u201cAlthough this release is certainly encouraging, it remains to be seen whether this figure is not subject to substantial revision.\u201d Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said improved eurozone GDP growth in the first quarter of 2016 was likely underpinned by decent consumer spending while the evidence from France and Austria indicated that business investment was healthy. German GDP figures are yet to come, but the region\u2019s biggest economy was likely to have put in a strong performance, said Archer. \u201cWe suspect first quarter eurozone GDP growth was also lifted appreciably by markedly increased expansion in Germany \u2013 indeed, it could well have doubled \u2013 while we also expect there to have been modest improvement in growth in Italy,\u201d said Archer. \u201cThe ECB will certainly be encouraged by the marked first quarter pick-up in eurozone GDP growth and will no doubt argue that it shows its monetary policy is working.

It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> In our opinion, the possibility that the U.K. could leave the European Union (EU) as a consequence of a planned \u201cleave or remain\u201d referendum set for June 23, 2016, represents a significant risk to the U.K. economy, in particular to its large financial services sector and exports.</p> <p>If the U.K. were to leave the EU, it may make financing its twin deficits more difficult, particularly its large current account deficit, which stood at 5.2% in 2015.</p> <p>A vote to leave would also likely lead to demands for another referendum on Scottish independence, leading to further uncertainty.</p> </blockquote> <p>It said the negative outlook reflected the possibility of at least a one in three chance of a downgrade over the next two years. It added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A vote to leave is likely to hurt confidence, investment, and GDP growth, and is likely to have a negative effect on public finances. As a consequence, a U.K. departure from the EU (or \u201cBrexit\u201d) would likely lead us to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating.</p> <p>We believe that, having left the EU (the destination for about 44% of U.K. goods and services exports), the U.K. would largely lose its capacity to influence the EU\u2019s policies for key sectors, including financial services.</p> <p>In our opinion, the loss of the U.K.\u2019s EU membership could also put at risk important external financing sources for the U.K.\u2019s large current account deficit. The U.K.\u2019s current account deficit stood at 5.2% of GDP in 2015 (the highest in several decades), down only slightly from the 2014 figure of 5.1%. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the deficit stood at an annualized 7% of GDP, the largest deficit since quarterly records began in 1955.</p> <p>In a worst-case scenario, a Brexit could also diminish sterling\u2019s role as a global reserve currency, which has been a significant support for our \u2018AAA\u2019 rating on the U.K.</p> <p>That said, our affirmation of the rating reflects our assumption that, by a small majority, the referendum will deliver a vote to remain in the EU, as well as our opinion that the U.K. benefits from its large, diversified, and open economy, exhibits high labor- and product-market flexibility, and enjoys credible monetary policy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-29T16:16:17.582Z\">at 5.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57237de2e4b02046f02ec0d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-29T15:30:10.341Z\">4.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Commodity stocks have been some of the main gainers in the past month.

All of the April decline was in the Expectations component, which fell by 4.8% from one month ago and by 12.6% from a year ago and by 14.7% from its January 2015 peak. The retreat from the 2015 peaks was evident across a wide range of expectations about prospects for the national economy.</p> <p>The size of the decline, while troublesome, is still far short of indicating an impending recession. The decline is all the more remarkable given that consumers\u2019 assessments of current economic conditions, including their personal finance, have remained largely unchanged at very positive levels during the past year. This divergence may reflect the strength of the consumer relative to the business sectors, and may have been exacerbated by growing uncertainty about the economic policies advocated by various presidential candidates.

                "bodyText":"The breakdown of the rig figures shows oil rigs falling by 11, gas rigs by 1 and miscellaneous rigs rising by 1 to give the total decline of 11 for the week. The total is the lowest since November 2009, as oil companies continue to be cautious despite the revival in crude in recent days, with Brent around its highest levels for the year. The Baker Hughes figures showed: Brent is currently 0.46% lower at $47.92 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. The number of US oil rigs drilling has dropped for the sixth week in a row. According to data from Baker Hughes, the number of rigs dropped by 11 to 420. The strength of the yen after the Bank of Japan decided on Thursday to delay any further stimulus measures has helped push stock markets sharply lower on the last trading day of the month. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 1.27% or 80.51 points to 6241.89 Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 2.73% to 10,038.97 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.82% lower at 4428.96 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 1.98% at 18,600.56 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.62% lower at 9025.7 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 583.65 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 122 points or 0.69% lower. Standard and Poor\u2019s has kept its UK credit rating at AAA, but with a negative outlook due to the risks of Britain leaving the European Union in what it expects to be a close referendum vote. It said: In our opinion, the possibility that the U.K. could leave the European Union (EU) as a consequence of a planned \u201cleave or remain\u201d referendum set for June 23, 2016, represents a significant risk to the U.K. economy, in particular to its large financial services sector and exports. If the U.K. were to leave the EU, it may make financing its twin deficits more difficult, particularly its large current account deficit, which stood at 5.2% in 2015. A vote to leave would also likely lead to demands for another referendum on Scottish independence, leading to further uncertainty. It said the negative outlook reflected the possibility of at least a one in three chance of a downgrade over the next two years. It added: A vote to leave is likely to hurt confidence, investment, and GDP growth, and is likely to have a negative effect on public finances. As a consequence, a U.K. departure from the EU (or \u201cBrexit\u201d) would likely lead us to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating. We believe that, having left the EU (the destination for about 44% of U.K. goods and services exports), the U.K. would largely lose its capacity to influence the EU\u2019s policies for key sectors, including financial services. In our opinion, the loss of the U.K.\u2019s EU membership could also put at risk important external financing sources for the U.K.\u2019s large current account deficit. The U.K.\u2019s current account deficit stood at 5.2% of GDP in 2015 (the highest in several decades), down only slightly from the 2014 figure of 5.1%. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the deficit stood at an annualized 7% of GDP, the largest deficit since quarterly records began in 1955. In a worst-case scenario, a Brexit could also diminish sterling\u2019s role as a global reserve currency, which has been a significant support for our \u2018AAA\u2019 rating on the U.K. That said, our affirmation of the rating reflects our assumption that, by a small majority, the referendum will deliver a vote to remain in the EU, as well as our opinion that the U.K. benefits from its large, diversified, and open economy, exhibits high labor- and product-market flexibility, and enjoys credible monetary policy. Commodity stocks have been some of the main gainers in the past month. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: Recapping the month, it\u2019s been the miners that have shone as commodity prices appear to be moving away from the dark days seen at the start of the year and some stability is returning to the market. Anglo American is up 40% on the month, whilst a number of the sector peers have added 15%-20% too. The index may be comprehensively off the highs we touched just 10 days ago, but without the boost from commodity stocks, the picture for April would have looked a whole lot bleaker. A June rise in US interest rates looks a little unlikely, and not just because of the uncertain US economic data: Oil prices have flattened out, with Brent crude now up just 0.1% at $48.2 a barrel. But they are still on track for their biggest monthly gain in seven years, helped by a weaker dollar and signs of a dip in US production. The increase also came despite Opec\u2019s inability to agree a cap on output at January\u2019s levels to tackle the current supply glut. And here\u2019s a chart of the consumer sentiment index: The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Consumer sentiment continued its slow decline in late April due to weakening expectations for future growth, although their views of current economic conditions remained positive. All of the April decline was in the Expectations component, which fell by 4.8% from one month ago and by 12.6% from a year ago and by 14.7% from its January 2015 peak. The retreat from the 2015 peaks was evident across a wide range of expectations about prospects for the national economy. The size of the decline, while troublesome, is still far short of indicating an impending recession. The decline is all the more remarkable given that consumers\u2019 assessments of current economic conditions, including their personal finance, have remained largely unchanged at very positive levels during the past year. This divergence may reflect the strength of the consumer relative to the business sectors, and may have been exacerbated by growing uncertainty about the economic policies advocated by various presidential candidates. Overall, the data indicate that inflation-adjusted personal consumption expenditures will grow by 2.5% in 2016. US consumer confidence is at its weakest since September last year, according to a new survey. The University of Michigan consumers sentiment index has fallen from 91 in March to 89 in April, below estimates of a level of 90. More downbeat US data. The Chicago purchasing management index has come in at 50.4 in April, compared to 53.6 in the previous month and expectations of a level of 53. Philip Uglow, chief economist of compilers MNI Indicators, said: This was a disappointing start to the second quarter, with the Barometer barely above the neutral 50 mark in April. Against a backdrop of softer domestic demand and the slowdown abroad, panellists are now more worried about the impact a rate hike might have on business than they were at the same time last year. US markets have followed other global bourses lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 46 points or 0.2% in early trading. Markets remain nervous as the yen hits an 18 month high, on concerns that the Bank of Japan may hold fire on any further stimulus measures after disappointing investors at this week\u2019s meeting. With mixed performances so far from the latest company reporting season - Apple being a notable casualty - markets are looking fairly fragile again. The FTSE 100 is down 0.9% while German and French markets are both down around 2%. Stronger than expected eurozone growth figures have done little for equities, but helped push the euro higher. Opec\u2019s oil output in April rose by 170,000 barrels month on month to 32.64m barrels, according to a Reuters survey. The rise, bringing the level close to January\u2019s record high, was led by Iran, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. There were declines reported by Kuwait following a strike, Nigeria and Venezuela with Saudi Arabian output little changed from March. Opec and other producers have so far failed to agree proposals to cap output at January\u2019s levels in an effort to combat the current supply glut. Brent crude is currently up 0.4% at $48.34 a barrel, not far off the $50 a barrel level which a number of companies including BP believe will bring back some stability to the sector. Traders across Europe have given a resounding shrug to the eurozone\u2019s growth figures. All the main stock markets are down today, with the FTSE 100 shedding 56 points (0.8%). The French and German markets are both deeper in the red, losing around 1.5%. Royal Bank of Scotland are the biggest faller, down almost 5% now, after reporting a fresh heavy loss. And the tech sector is looking jittery, after billionaire investor Carl Icann revealed he had ditched his stake in Apple. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: For tech shares, April has indeed been \u2018the cruellest month\u2019, and while the sector as a whole is still up since the February lows, it looks like any further market rally for US shares may well have to contend without support from these high-growth names. Swiss bank UBS has upgraded its forecast for eurozone growth this year. It now expects the region to expand by 1.6% in 2016, up from 1.4%, following the news that growth has doubled to 0.6%. Reinhard Cluse, UBS economist explains: While temporary factors, including weather, may partly explain this outcome, today\u2019s reading nevertheless comes as a rather positive surprise when considering the difficult external environment at the beginning of the year. Today\u2019s GDP report contains less detail than usual, as Eurostat have produced it within 30 days of the quarter\u2019s end, not the usual 45 days. Tomas Holinka, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, reckons the growth rate could prove to be too optimistic, once more data comes in: \u201cThe euro zone economy was at a better shape at the beginning of this year than expected. The quarterly growth accelerated to 0.6% in the three months to March, from 0.3% in the previous quarter. Although this preliminary number might be revised down in coming months, the growth definitely surprised on the upside. Yet weakening U.S. and emerging market economies, the influx of migrants, and a possible U.K. exit from the EU are key risks to the region\u2019s economy.\u201d Bert Colijn, economist at ING, says he\u2019s \u201castonished\u201d that eurozone growth has doubled to 0.6%: The first months of the year were tumultuous with large stock market declines, growth concerns in the US, China and many emerging markets and plummeting confidence among businesses and consumers. Clearly, businesses and consumers have not acted on their gut feelings. While the US and UK are suffering from a strong dollar and a possible Brexit, the Eurozone saw a marked acceleration. This jump in eurozone growth comes at a good time, given worries over Brexit, political uncertainty in Spain, and the renewed tensions in Greece. But Alasdair Cavalla of the Centre for Economics and Business Research urges caution: This is the fastest rate of output growth since Q1 2015 for the Eurozone and its timing is propitious given the numerous sources of anxiety for the continent. However, false dawns have been common since the financial crisis and nowhere more so than in Europe. Country-level figures revealed the French economy is finally getting into gear, showing a 0.5% rise. It\u2019s taken the eurozone a long, long time to reach its pre-crisis levels again. As this chart shows, its post-Lehman recovery was knocked off course in 2011 by the debt crisis: Despite this stronger growth, the eurozone has fallen back into negative inflation. Prices across the single currency bloc fell by 0.2% this month, Eurostat reports, having been flat in March. It\u2019s mainly due to cheap oil, with energy prices falling 8.6% compared with April 2015. Service sector prices have risen by 1%, while food, alcohol &amp; tobacco costs 0.8% more and industrial goods prices are up 0.5%. In another boost, unemployment across the euro area has hit a new four and a half-year low. The eurozone unemployment rate dropped to 10.2% in March, down from 10.4% in February, and the lowest recorded since August 2011. Unemploment across the wider EU dropped to 8.8%, a near seven-year low. Here\u2019s some detail: Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates in March 2016 were recorded in the Czech Republic (4.1%) and Germany (4.2%). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (24.4% in January 2016) and Spain (20.4%). Unemployment has fallen in 25 European countries in the last year, but rose in Finland and Austria. This suggests that the European recovery is finally gaining traction. However, there is a lot of catching up to do - in America, the jobless rate is 5% The eurozone has finally recovered all the economic output lost when the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the biggest financial crisis in generations. But it\u2019s been a bumpy ride, and Spain and Italy have yet to reach this milestone: This is the strongest eurozone growth rate in a year. The wider EU expanded by 0.5% during the last quarter. The eurozone grew by 0.6% in the first three months of 2016. That\u2019s twice as strong as in the previous three months, and much stronger than expect. Better-than-expected growth in France and Spain helped the eurozone to beat forecasts, and grow faster than the UK (which expanded by 0.4% last quarter). Advertising giant WPP has thrown more fuel on the fire of excessive pay, by handing its boss, Sir Martin Sorrell, a pay packet of almost \u00a371m. Over \u00a362m of the remuneration package comes from WPP\u2019s long-term incentive plan, but Sorrell is also getting \u00a37.6m in base salary, short-term bonuses and other rewards. Sorrell has built WPP into a global titan over several decades, so deserves a lot of credit for the company\u2019s success. But still, expect some criticism - this is the second biggest payday for a UK boss ever. More encouraging news: Italy\u2019s unemployment rate has hit its lowest rate in over three years. Figures just released show that the Italian jobless rate dipped to 11.4% in March, from 11.6% percent in February. Philippe Waechter, chief economist at Natixis Asset Management, also believes the rise in French growth will help Francois Hollande: Waechter says (via the FT): \u201cThere is a stronger situation in the labour market and that will create strong momentum this year... It\u2019s perfect timing for Hollande.\u201d The acceleration in French growth to 0.5% is good news for Francois Hollande, the embattled president. And finance minister Michel Sapin has declared that the government\u2019s economic plans are paying off. saying: \u201cThis is solid growth. Output is increasing and translating into more jobs and a drop in unemployment.\u201d On Wednesday, France posted its biggest fall in unemployment in 15 years, after hitting a string of record highs. Shares in airlines group IAG have dropped by over 4% this morning after it warned that March\u2019s Brussels terror attacks have hit sales. IAG, which owns British Airways, is cutting back its growth plans after seeing weaker demand from high-margin business-travellers. The eurozone may have grown faster than expected in the last quarter. Economists had forecast growth of 0.4%. But with France and Spain both beating expectations (and Germany not reporting GDP yet), we might get a higher number in 90 minutes time.... Spain has racked up another quarter of strong economic growth, despite the political turmoil that has gripped the country this year. Spanish GDP rose by 0.8% in the first quarter of 2016, matching the previous three months. Its economy has now been growing for almost three years: That\u2019s slightly faster than the 0.7% which economists had expected, suggesting that Spain shrugged off the deadlock since last December\u2019s inconclusive election. Breaking: Austria\u2019s economy grew by 0.4% in the first three months of this year. That beats the 0.3% growth reported in the October-December quarter, and is the best result in more than two years. Reuters has more details: Exports rose 0.8%, up from 0.7% in Q4 2015 Imports increased 0.9%, down from 1.1% quarter. Gross investment rose 1.0%, household consumption grew 0.2% state consumption was up 0.3%. The oil price has just hit its highest level of the year. Brent crude is now trading at $48.30 per barrel, up 0.3% this morning. Three months ago, it was changing hands at just $28 per barrel, dragged down by oversupply fears and the weakening global economy. European stock markets are expected to fall this morning, despite France\u2019s better-than-expected growth figures. Investors are jittery following a late selloff on Wall Street last night (the Dow Jones fell 1%). There have been fresh losses in Asia overnight too. Disappointingly, Germany isn\u2019t reporting its growth figures this morning. Instead, it has just released some alarmingly weak consumer spending figures. Retail sales slumped by 1.1% in March, compared to February, which is the biggest monthly fall in 18 months. Economists had expected growth of 0.4% It could be a sign that Germany\u2019s domestic economy is weakening, adding to concerns that its exporters will suffer from the global slowdown. More reaction to France\u2019s growth figures: This chart confirms that domestic spending (in red) drove the French economy forwards in the last quarter: GFCF (gross fixed capital formation) - a measure of business investment, also rose. Trade had a negative impact on growth, though; imports rose by 0.5% while exports fell by 0.2%. Fred Ducrozet of private Swiss-bank Pictet agrees that the French growth figures are encouraging: France\u2019s strong performance means the eurozone may economy finally have recovered all the damage caused in the financial crisis. The French economy has smashed expectations, by growing by 0.5% in the last quarter. That\u2019s the best quarterly growth rate in a year, up from just 0.3% in October-December. It suggests France is recovering from the trauma of November\u2019s terrorist attacks. INSEE, the French stats body, reports that French household spending is \u201crecovering strongly\u201d, rising to 1.2% from -0.1% three months ago. Capital expenditure rose to 0.9%, from 0.7%, suggesting companies are a little more confident. In short, a good start to Eurozone GDP day.... Reaction to follow... Good morning. We\u2019re about to get a major healthcheck on the European economy. For starters, it\u2019s Eurozone GDP day, when a swathe of European countries report their growth figures for the last quarter. Economists predict that the single currency region may have expanded by 0.4% in January to March, up from 0.3% in the previous quarter. That would match Britain\u2019s performance, and comfortably beat the US (which expanded by a mere 0.13% in the last quarter). But it still wouldn\u2019t be fast enough to create the millions of extra jobs Europe needs. On top of that, we\u2019re also getting new inflation and unemployment figures, so it\u2019s going to be busy..... Here\u2019s how the morning might unfold (all times provisional) France GDP: 6.30am BST / 7.30am CEST Spain GDP: 8am BST / 10am CEST Austria GDP: 8am BST / 10am CEST The eurozone GDP: 10am BST / 11am CEST Eurozone inflation for April: 10am BST / 11am CEST Eurozone unemployment for March: 10am BST / 11am CEST",
