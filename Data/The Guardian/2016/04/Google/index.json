Amid criticism that official statistics fail to capture the full picture of Britain\u2019s modern economy, the Office for National Statistics has been planning to update its surveys to better measure the new ways people consume and trade goods and services. The ONS will publish on Tuesday a feasibility study into how it could measure the sharing economy, where people use online marketplaces and social networks to buy, swap and share assets such as rooms and cars, as well as services such as cleaning or business consultancy. A government-ordered review has called for the ONS to be more innovative and for economic statistics to be brought up to date. The ONS has been speaking to businesses and members of the public to establish how well the sharing economy is understood, aiming to add new questions to its surveys. The article on Tuesday will also explore how statisticians could better use data from the public sector and data from companies. In his review of official statistics published last month, the former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Charlie Bean estimated that if the digital economy was fully captured it could add as much as 0.75 percentage points to the UK\u2019s growth rate. Bean used the example of people booking holidays. In the past they may have paid a travel agent, bought a map or a guidebook and then paid to make calls home once on holiday. Now holidaymakers can make their own bookings online, use Google Maps once away and call home on WhatsApp or Skype. In other words, people are using services that are free or paid for by advertising rather than paid for by consumers, and methods of measuring the economy risk overlooking such free services. The review highlighted the rise of the sharing economy and noted that London has produced 72 sharing economy startups, the third largest number in the world, behind only San Francisco and New York. The economist Diane Coyle, known for her work on GDP figures, recently estimated that 3% of the UK workforce provided a service through the sharing economy. Her report with the trade body Sharing Economy UK (SEUK) said that while such activities were growing rapidly in the UK, it was impossible to track their contribution through official economic statistics. Ahead of the ONS study, SEUK\u2019s chair, Debbie Wosskow, said the UK must do more to accurately measure and \u201charness the power\u201d of the sharing economy to address its poor productivity record. \u201cWe welcome ONS\u2019 efforts to further recommend how the sharing economy can be measured \u2013 better data can and will make for a more informed policy debate. However, we need these recommendations to be followed with actions to ensure the UK remains the true home of the global sharing economy,\u201d said Wosskow, who is also founder of Love Home Swap, a home exchange company.

This is partly because the IMF appears to be constrained by the official, government forecasts for China and India, but its projections for the US and the euro-zone also look too optimistic.</p> <p>Among advanced economies, the key differences [between the IMF and our forecasts] are that we are less optimistic about both the US and the euro-zone.

A vote to leave would, it says, have serious consequences not just for Britain and its EU partners but for the whole of the global economy. The Fund is twitchy. It can identify a number of different triggers that might possibly bring about a new, dangerous phase of the crisis \u2013 such as a sharper than expected slowdown in China, a collapse in emerging markets or a pandemic. But with little more than two months to go before the referendum, Brexit is the most immediate threat.</p> <p>But if the Fund is right in its assessment, something will trigger the crisis sooner or later even if Britain decides to remain a member of the EU. The IMF says global growth has been too slow for too long, and proposes a mix of expansionary monetary policy (low interest rates and quantitative easing), higher spending on infrastructure and research and development, and structural reforms to boost productivity.</p> <p>This, though, seems a bit timid if the Fund is right in its analysis that globalisation benefits the few not the many and that a rising tide no longer lifts all boats. In that case, the remedy would not be more R&amp;D spending but checks on financial speculation and more aggressive redistribution. Global growth has indeed been too slow for too long.

Tortuous talks to complete the first review under debt-stricken Greece\u2019s third international bailout are beginning to resemble the momentum that triggered crunch time in 2015. Despite the positive face put on by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who emerged in the early hours to say that progress had been made, there is no hiding the divide that still exists between Athens and the foreign lenders keeping the country afloat.</p> <p>As the straight-talking Oxford-educated finance minister himself admitted:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cbecause there are many other small [issues] we did not have the time to discuss it became obvious to all of us that it was not possible to have a staff level agreement by day break today.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Disagreement over non performing loans and pension reforms still linger but beyond discord over Athens\u2019 ability to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % by 2018, it is the much bigger disagreement over debt relief that has come to cloud the talks. The inability of Berlin and the International Monetary Fund to see eye-to-eye on the matter is unlikely to be resolved soon.</p> <p>Even if Greek officials manage to put the final touches to a deal that would effectively conclude the process later this week at the IMF\u2019s spring meetings in Washington DC, in Athens almost no one believes in a similar breakthrough on the crucial issue of debt relief. Without debt forgiveness, few have faith in the shattered Greek economy ever recovering. While the IMF continues to advocate a debt haircut, EU member states led by Berlin have hinted that, at most, a reduction would come in the form of longer maturities and grace periods.</p> <p>In private, leading members of the leftist led government are holding out the hope that Europe\u2019s refugee emergency \u2013 and Greece\u2019s frontline role \u2013 will help cut it some slack.</p> <p>\u201cBut that line of thought could backfire in so many ways,\u201d says Aristides Hatzis, associate professor of law and economics at the University of Athens.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFirst of all from the far right that will exploit anti-immigrant sentiment while the trade off of less reforms for more refugees will, quite rightly, never be accepted by the IMF.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>If the talks aren\u2019t concluded by May, Greece, will, once again, face a ferocious liquidity problem just when it confronts \u20ac5bn worth of debt repayments in June and July (money it does not have) and the UK is gearing up for its in-out EU referendum. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YiannisMouzakis/status/719840789648375809\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a>&#39;s 2016 debt obligations <a href=\"https://t.co/uqXMoeoCr4\">pic.twitter.com/uqXMoeoCr4</a></p>&mdash; Yiannis Mouzakis (@YiannisMouzakis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YiannisMouzakis/status/719840789648375809\">April 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-12T11:33:00.264Z\">at 12.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-570cd444e4b00591e8dc8a62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-12T10:58:16.399Z\">11.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newsflash: Saudi Arabia\u2019s credit rating has just been cut by one notch, to AA-, by Fitch.</strong></p> <p>Fitch also left Saudi Arabia with a negative outlook, meaning further cuts are possible.</p> <p>It cited the \u201cnegative implications\u201d of cheaper oil on the country\u2019s fiscal stability, and also pointed to rising tensions with Iran.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/business/status/719840841905369089\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Saudi Arabia ratings cut by Fitch, which says outlook remains negative <a href=\"https://t.co/wx9kCQwAFW\">https://t.co/wx9kCQwAFW</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hdRW81pEih\">pic.twitter.com/hdRW81pEih</a></p>&mdash; Bloomberg (@business) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/business/status/719840841905369089\">April 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-570cd146e4b00591e8dc8a58\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-12T10:53:32.955Z\">11.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB's Weidmann defends Draghi</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"07d0814dc6fa3858edb9825faaa43df5d379043c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07d0814dc6fa3858edb9825faaa43df5d379043c/0_0_3500_1730/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The President of the Deutsche Bundesbank (German Central Bank) Jens Weidmann.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"494\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Has peace broken out at the European Central Bank, between president Mario Draghi and his more hawkish colleague Jens Weidmann?</strong></p> <p>Weidmann, who heads up Germany\u2019s central bank, has leapt to Draghi\u2019s defence against critics - including many Germans \u2013 who oppose his monetary easing and record low interest rates.</p> <p>Speaking to the Financial Times, Weidmann argues (persuasively) that it\u2019s too simplistic to just talk about \u2018savers\u2019 suffering from low borrowing costs.

However, the UK economy is battling a number of significant headwinds at present. Consumer spending, aided by low inflation, low unemployment and rising wages, has been the engine of economic growth lately.

Fares rose by 2.7% between the same 2 months in 2015.</p> <p>There was also a smaller upward effect from rail passenger transport with fares rising this year but falling a year ago. These upward effects were partially offset by a downward contribution from motor fuels with petrol prices rising by 0.9 pence per litre this year compared with a larger rise of 3.8 pence per litre a year ago.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Clothing and footwear: </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>prices, overall, rose by 1.0% between February and March this year compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. Last year was the first time that prices had fallen between February and March since the CPI started in 1996. Normally they rise as they continue to recover following the January sales period. The upward contribution this year came from price movements across a range of women\u2019s outerwear.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Restaurants and hotels: </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>prices, overall, rose by 0.5% between February and March 2016 compared with a rise of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago.

                "bodyText":"A jump in the oil price has fuelled a rise in European markets, which had previously been looking rather uncertain. Hopes of an agreement at the imminent meeting of oil producers in Doha, specifically suggestions that Russia and Saudi Arabia had agreed a freeze, sent crude prices to new highs for the year. Brent is currently 3.7% higher at $44.43 a barrel, having touched $44.73, while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is up 3.1% at $41.61. Oil has also been lifted by the weakness in the dollar, as investors bet there would not be an imminent rise in US interest rates. Meanwhile, optimism that the Chinese economy may be stabilising helped other commodities and pushed mining shares higher. The gloomy news from the International Monetary Fund, which cut its global growth forecasts, was pushed to one side. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 42.27 points or 0.68% at 6242.39 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.81% to 9761.47 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.77% to 4345.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.57% higher at 8546.3 But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB bucked the trend, falling 1.57% to 17,444.80 as the country\u2019s banks slipped back after recent gains on confirmation of a plan to restructure bad loans In Greece, the Athens market dipped 1.34% to 553.43 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 157 points or 0.9% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The IMF\u2019s growth forecasts still look too optimistic even though they have been downgraded, says Capital Economics: Despite being revised down yet again, we think the IMF\u2019s latest projections for global growth are still too high. This is partly because the IMF appears to be constrained by the official, government forecasts for China and India, but its projections for the US and the euro-zone also look too optimistic. Among advanced economies, the key differences [between the IMF and our forecasts] are that we are less optimistic about both the US and the euro-zone. With first-quarter growth in the US now likely to be only around 1.0%, the risks to our US forecast are to the downside. And for the euro-zone, the generally disappointing first-quarter data have supported our view that activity is likely to slow this year. Among emerging economies, we think growth in China will be around 5.5%. Note that although this is lower than official and IMF estimates, it would be an improvement compared to last year. For India, too, the difference between our projections and those of the IMF is partly due to uncertainty surrounding the official national accounts data. Finally, although Brazil and Russia\u2019s recessions both look set to continue this year, we expect them to be slightly less severe than is projected by the IMF. (A reminder that there were hopes of an agreement over the weekend.) More on the Greek situation: Oil prices were always going to be influenced by reports ahead of the producers\u2019 meeting, said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, but in practice, any output freeze at January levels may not bring the benefits expected. He said: Rumours of a deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia for a production freeze provided further gains for crude today amid a four-month high for Brent. This week was always likely to see market positioning in advance of the meeting, which has driven substantial gains across the energy sector. However, given that many of the world producers are pumping less than they did in January, a freeze could even increase the amount of crude being produced. Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has said that two bills on pensions and taxes - sticking points in the discussions with the country\u2019s creditors - will be presented to parliament next week, Reuters in reporting. And - something to look forward to - he has also suggested there may be an extra Eurogroup meeting on 25 or 26 April. Earlier senior German government officials told Reuters that there could be no decision on any debt measures for Greece until the bailout review has been completed. The oil price increase is giving some support to stock markets, with the FTSE 100, Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac all climbing around 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 110 points or 0.6%. The positive moves come despite the gloomy noises coming from the International Monetary Fund which has cut its global growth forecasts again. Oil continues to strengthen, now helped by another report that key producers might agree a deal to tackle the supply glut, this time from news agency Interfax: Here\u2019s Reuters on the IMF\u2019s latest comments on Greece: The International Monetary Fund\u2019s chief economist said on Tuesday that Europe will need to show some flexibility towards Greece as it deals with a refugee crisis and negotiates a new bailout package. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly going to be a need for more flexibility to tackle the refugee crisis and some support from the broader European community,\u201d IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said in a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s a European problem, it\u2019s actually a global problem.\u201d He said the IMF has during its negotiations with Athens called for some debt relief, coupled with fiscal adjustments by the Greek government that would put the country on a path towards debt sustainability. The talks are on hold for the IMF-World Bank spring meetings this week in Washington. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking a stand on each particular component. But we need a program that adds up,\u201d Obstfeld said. Here\u2019s a list of the recent Brexit polls: After its earlier strength on the back of higher than expected UK inflation figures, sterling has now fallen back as a new survey shows the campaign for Britain to leave the EU is in the lead. The pound is down almost half a cent to $1.431 as an ICM poll put leave on 45% and remain on 42%. The European Commission has now unveiled its tax proposals for large corporations. Jennifer Rankin writes: Multinational companies will be forced to disclose profits earned and taxes paid in Europe and the world\u2019s shadiest fiscal havens, under proposals announced on Tuesday by EU regulators. The European commission wants all large companies to publish a country-by-country breakdown of profits, taxes, employees and turnover in all 28 member states of the EU, as well as some of the most problematic tax havens. American and Chinese companies with a subsidiary in Europe would also be subject to the transparency drive, as the rules would hit all global corporations with a large presence in Europe. If agreed, the new disclosure requirements would shine a spotlight on some of the world\u2019s most powerful companies, including Apple, Google and Starbucks, which have been caught up in a public furore over their tax bills. Lord Hill, the European commissioner for financial services, said the new rules would give the public \u201ca clear idea of whether a large multinational is paying tax where they make their profits\u201d. The proposals would be good for competition, he said, by levelling the playing field between large corporations and smaller firms. \u201cBy using complicated tax arrangements, some multinationals can pay nearly a third less tax than companies that only operate in one country.\u201d The full story is here: The US should wait until inflation is stronger before raising rates, according to Philadelphia Federal Reserve president Patrick Harker. And negative interest rates, although legally and technically difficult, should not be taken off the table, he said, echoing comments earlier this year from Fed chair Janet Yellen. Harker told a local business group: Although I remain confident that inflation will return to the Committee\u2019s 2 percent target, my outlook sees it doing so only gradually... global headwinds point to some downside risks to my economic outlook. These considerations make me a bit more conservative in my approach to policy, at least in the very near term. Although I cannot give you a definitive path for how policy will evolve, it might prove prudent to wait until the inflation data are stronger before we undertake a second rate hike. So, I am approaching near-term policy more cautiously than I did a few months ago. That is part of being data dependent. And attentiveness to the data will be a key factor in all of my future policy recommendations as well. If financial headwinds dissipate quickly and inflation picks up a bit more aggressively, it will require a slightly more aggressive approach to policy. [But] it will take fewer rate hikes to attain neutrality in policy than it would have 15 years ago. By historical standards, that in itself implies a somewhat shallower path for interest rates than was typical of past recoveries. The IMF\u2019s economic counsellor Maurice Obstfeld has said there is a need for more flexibility between Europe and Greece to handle the refugee crisis and the debt situation. Bruce Springsteen, Paypal and now Deutsche Bank. The bank has added its name to the list of those protesting a controversial anti-LGBT law in North Carolina. It has frozen plans to create 250 new jobs at its Cary, North Carolina, operation after the state became the first in the US to enact legislation requiring people to use public bathrooms or locker rooms that match the gender on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity. John Cryan, co-chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank, said: \u201cWe take our commitment to building inclusive work environments seriously. We\u2019re proud of our operations and employees in Cary and regret that as a result of this legislation we are unwilling to include North Carolina in our US expansion plans for now. We very much hope that we can re-visit our plans to grow this location in the near future.\u201d The bank currently employs 900 people at Cary and said it was \u201ccommitted to sustaining that existing presence.\u201d Last week Springsteen cancelled a concert in North Carolina because of the new law, which critics say legalises discrimination. Bank of America and American Airlines, which are based in Charlotte, have condemned the law, while PayPal cancelled plans to open a new operation center in Charlotte. The IMF is worried about a new phase of the financial crisis, but its proposals to remedy the situation do not go far enough, writes Larry Elliott: The prospect of Brexit clearly scares the IMF. A vote to leave would, it says, have serious consequences not just for Britain and its EU partners but for the whole of the global economy. The Fund is twitchy. It can identify a number of different triggers that might possibly bring about a new, dangerous phase of the crisis \u2013 such as a sharper than expected slowdown in China, a collapse in emerging markets or a pandemic. But with little more than two months to go before the referendum, Brexit is the most immediate threat. But if the Fund is right in its assessment, something will trigger the crisis sooner or later even if Britain decides to remain a member of the EU. The IMF says global growth has been too slow for too long, and proposes a mix of expansionary monetary policy (low interest rates and quantitative easing), higher spending on infrastructure and research and development, and structural reforms to boost productivity. This, though, seems a bit timid if the Fund is right in its analysis that globalisation benefits the few not the many and that a rising tide no longer lifts all boats. In that case, the remedy would not be more R&amp;D spending but checks on financial speculation and more aggressive redistribution. Global growth has indeed been too slow for too long. The Fund\u2019s remedy is too little too late. His full analysis is here: Ahead of its spring meeting the International Monetary Fund has, as expected, cut its forecasts for global growth, at the same time as warning on the risks of Britain leaving the European Union. Katie Allen and Anushka Asthana write: A British vote to leave the EU risks causing severe economic and political damage to Europe that will spill over into an already febrile world economy, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Cutting its forecasts for global growth and for the UK and other advanced economies, the IMF listed a potential Brexit vote in June\u2019s EU referendum as a key risk in its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO)... The IMF now predicts global GDP growth will edge up only slightly this year, to 3.2%, from growth of 3.1% in 2015. That compared with a 2016 forecast of 3.4% in a January update and of 3.6% in the last WEO in October. The 2017 forecast was cut to 3.5% from, 3.6% in January... The IMF cut its forecast for UK GDP growth this year. After growing 2.2% in 2015, the economy was now expected to expand 1.9% in 2016, down from a forecast of 2.2% made by the Fund in January. That compares with 2.0% growth predicted for 2016 by the government\u2019s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility. The IMF left its forecast for 2017 growth unchanged at 2.2%. The full story is here: US import prices rose in March by 0.2% after a revised 0.4% drop in the previous month. The increase came following a rise in the cost of petroleum products, but it was less than the 1% expected by analysts. Brent crude has climbed above $43 a barrel on hopes that next week\u2019s meeting of oil producers can agree to freeze output to tackle the current supply glut. Iraqi oil official Falah Alamri said he was confident that the meeting with Opec and other producers in Doha would reach an agreement. Oil is also being supported by hopes that the Chinese economy is stabilising after a rise in vehicle sales. On top of that, the weak dollar is helping commodities. The gap between UK inflation and average earnings is narrowing: MPs are about to start an emergency debate on the crisis in the UK steel industry. My colleague Andrew Sparrow will be following proceedings in the politics live blog: The dollar has fallen to an eight month low against a basket of currencies as investors continue to bet that the Federal Reserve is in no hurry to raise US interest rates. Meanwhile sterling has climbed to its highest level in more than a week after the higher than expected UK inflation figures. The pound is up around half a percent at $1.4313 after the data, which suggested that UK rates could rise more quickly than people had been expecting. Greece\u2019s inability to wrap up negotiations with creditors last night has fuelled fears that the talks could drag on until the early summer, potentially coinciding with Britain\u2019s referendum on EU membership. Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, reports: Another deadline marked; another deadline missed. Tortuous talks to complete the first review under debt-stricken Greece\u2019s third international bailout are beginning to resemble the momentum that triggered crunch time in 2015. Despite the positive face put on by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who emerged in the early hours to say that progress had been made, there is no hiding the divide that still exists between Athens and the foreign lenders keeping the country afloat. As the straight-talking Oxford-educated finance minister himself admitted: \u201cbecause there are many other small [issues] we did not have the time to discuss it became obvious to all of us that it was not possible to have a staff level agreement by day break today.\u201d Disagreement over non performing loans and pension reforms still linger but beyond discord over Athens\u2019 ability to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % by 2018, it is the much bigger disagreement over debt relief that has come to cloud the talks. The inability of Berlin and the International Monetary Fund to see eye-to-eye on the matter is unlikely to be resolved soon. Even if Greek officials manage to put the final touches to a deal that would effectively conclude the process later this week at the IMF\u2019s spring meetings in Washington DC, in Athens almost no one believes in a similar breakthrough on the crucial issue of debt relief. Without debt forgiveness, few have faith in the shattered Greek economy ever recovering. While the IMF continues to advocate a debt haircut, EU member states led by Berlin have hinted that, at most, a reduction would come in the form of longer maturities and grace periods. In private, leading members of the leftist led government are holding out the hope that Europe\u2019s refugee emergency \u2013 and Greece\u2019s frontline role \u2013 will help cut it some slack. \u201cBut that line of thought could backfire in so many ways,\u201d says Aristides Hatzis, associate professor of law and economics at the University of Athens. \u201cFirst of all from the far right that will exploit anti-immigrant sentiment while the trade off of less reforms for more refugees will, quite rightly, never be accepted by the IMF.\u201d If the talks aren\u2019t concluded by May, Greece, will, once again, face a ferocious liquidity problem just when it confronts \u20ac5bn worth of debt repayments in June and July (money it does not have) and the UK is gearing up for its in-out EU referendum. Newsflash: Saudi Arabia\u2019s credit rating has just been cut by one notch, to AA-, by Fitch. Fitch also left Saudi Arabia with a negative outlook, meaning further cuts are possible. It cited the \u201cnegative implications\u201d of cheaper oil on the country\u2019s fiscal stability, and also pointed to rising tensions with Iran. Has peace broken out at the European Central Bank, between president Mario Draghi and his more hawkish colleague Jens Weidmann? Weidmann, who heads up Germany\u2019s central bank, has leapt to Draghi\u2019s defence against critics - including many Germans \u2013 who oppose his monetary easing and record low interest rates. Speaking to the Financial Times, Weidmann argues (persuasively) that it\u2019s too simplistic to just talk about \u2018savers\u2019 suffering from low borrowing costs. Employees, taxpayers, and anyone with debts are benefitting from the current situation. Weidmann is understood to have opposed some of Draghi\u2019s attempts to stimulate growth and inflation in the euro area. But he\u2019s adamant that politicians should keep their noses out: \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for politicians to have opinions on monetary policy, but we are independent,\u201d \u201cThe ECB has to deliver on its price stability mandate and thus an expansionary monetary policy stance is appropriate at this juncture regardless of different views about specific measures.\u201d More here: Bundesbank\u2019s Weidmann rebukes Draghi critics in Berlin This might ruffle some feathers in Berlin. Last Friday, German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble blamed Draghi for the rise of the eurosceptic AfD party, and declared that central banks should raise interest rates..... British house continue to outpace both the headline inflation rate and average earnings. New figures show that UK house prices increased by 7.6% in the year to February 2016. That\u2019s down from 7.9% in the year to January 2016: Once again, strong demand in London (+9.7%) and the South East (+11.4%) drove the market, while other regions were more subdued. House price annual inflation was 8.2% in England, 2.8% in Wales, -0.8% in Scotland and 2.4% in Northern Ireland. Here\u2019s our news story about the rise in UK inflation in March: The recent weakness in the pound, which has fallen 6% since last October, has also pushed inflation higher (by driving up the cost of imports). Dimitris Hiotis, partner at pricing experts Simon-Kucher &amp; Partner, reckons this trend could continue ahead of June\u2019s EU referendum. With the judgement day on Brexit looming, the sterling has continued to depreciate in recent months, which has increased the cost of imports to the country. As we move closer to the referendum on June 23rd, and with the latest polls showing it to be a close run race, we expect sterling to depreciate further and therefore cause additional inflationary pressures in the coming months. The Institute of Directors (whose members largely oppose Brexit) agrees. IoD chief economist Michael Martins argues: \u201cThe slight rise in inflation is likely connected to depreciation of the pound as uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum increases and international investors begin to sell off sterling. This is not a one-month phenomenon \u2013 core inflation, which strips out volatile factors like energy and food, increased to 1.5% in March, after averaging 1.1% over the last 8 months. \u201cWhile the Bank of England has been keen to see prices rising as a spur to economic growth, if pay rises do not shadow increased inflation, real wages will decline, putting pressure on people\u2019s wallets and holding back increases in productivity. Real wage increases are now under 2% (1.9%), running just ahead of core inflation. This rise in inflation doesn\u2019t mean that the UK economy is healed, argues TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady: \u201cDespite a small rise, the overall picture is still of very low inflation. It indicates that the economy is still not at full strength, with too much underemployment and too little wage growth. \u201cWith the global economy slowing down, the government cannot just sit by. We need investment in skills, infrastructure and public services to promote growth for the long term.\u201d Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), has urged the Bank of England to resist any temptation to raise interest rates at this week\u2019s meeting. He reckons his members have enough on their collective plates: \u201cSmall firms are currently dealing with a raft of challenges, including the National Living Wage which came into effect this month, driving up costs and driving down modest profit. A recent FSB survey showed small business confidence hovering at its lowest level since 2013. Despite inflation edging up last month, our members welcome this ongoing period of low inflation which has helped to keep other operating costs manageable. Economists are split over when the Bank of England might take the plunge and raise interest rates, now that inflation is creeping towards its 2% target. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, reckons the BoE is \u201cmiles away from raising rates\u201d, given the state of the UK economy. Stewart argues: The Bank\u2019s big problem is sustaining growth and getting inflation up. \u201cInflation may have bottomed, but the mounting risks in the global economy, and the continued risk of deflation, means that interest rates are likely to stay on hold until next year.\u201d But Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg reckons the first hike could come in November - unless Britain votes to leave the EU, of course. Looking ahead, we expect the headline rate to increase to 1.6% by the final quarter of the year. Beyond the modest dent to GDP growth in the first half of this year as a result of the financial market rout and Brexit uncertainty, underlying fundamentals point to robust growth at around trend (0.5% qoq) in the second half of the year driven by strong consumer spending and recovering business investment. The on-going acceleration in inflation, alongside consumer credit growth at a decade high, household saving at a historic low and the labour market at full employment begs the question if near-zero rates are still appropriate. Indeed, data for household spending, borrowing and saving point to some overheating in the domestic economy. Therefore, as long as the UK votes to stay in the EU we expect the Bank of England to hike rates by 25 bps in November. We see a 35% chance of a Brexit. Confused about how inflation is calculated? Or wondering why some economists have been fretting about deflation? Our video explainer has the answers... You can see the inflation report here, on the Office for National Statistics website. Today\u2019s rise in inflation may undermine the notion that UK interest rates could stay on hold until 2020. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics certainly thinks so, saying: Inflation pressures are continuing to build, challenging the consensus view in the markets that the MPC will leave interest rates on hold until the end of the decade. The rise in the headline rate entirely reflected an increase in core inflation to 1.5%, from 1.2% in February. About half this increase came from airfares, the rest from stronger inflation in the clothing and restaurant sectors. Airfares were reportedly boosted by Easter in late March, but we have our doubts that all of their rise is temporary. Ben Brettell, senior economist at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown, also believes the Bank of England will sit tight at this week\u2019s monetary policy meeting. Naturally policymakers will need to remain mindful of the risk that inflation overshoots at some point. However, the UK economy is battling a number of significant headwinds at present. Consumer spending, aided by low inflation, low unemployment and rising wages, has been the engine of economic growth lately. But recent surveys suggest consumers reined in their spending in March - perhaps the first sign of nerves ahead of June\u2019s EU referendum. All in all, the economic picture remains highly uncertain and I expect no action from Threadneedle Street for some time yet. Britain\u2019s inflation rate is still far too low to prompt an interest rate rise, says Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International: Today\u2019s increase is unlikely to spur the Bank of England into considering raising interest rates on Thursday with widespread consensus that this week will see the 85th consecutive month that the bank keeps interest rates on hold at their emergency level of 0.50%. Bloomberg columnist Mark Gilbert is struck by the surge in air fares last month. Here\u2019s some details from today\u2019s UK inflation report: Transport: prices, overall, rose by 1.7% between February and March this year compared with a rise of 0.7% between the same 2 months a year ago. By far the largest upward effect came from air transport where the timing of Easter contributed to fares rising by 22.9% between February and March 2016. Fares rose by 2.7% between the same 2 months in 2015. There was also a smaller upward effect from rail passenger transport with fares rising this year but falling a year ago. These upward effects were partially offset by a downward contribution from motor fuels with petrol prices rising by 0.9 pence per litre this year compared with a larger rise of 3.8 pence per litre a year ago. Clothing and footwear: prices, overall, rose by 1.0% between February and March this year compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. Last year was the first time that prices had fallen between February and March since the CPI started in 1996. Normally they rise as they continue to recover following the January sales period. The upward contribution this year came from price movements across a range of women\u2019s outerwear. Restaurants and hotels: prices, overall, rose by 0.5% between February and March 2016 compared with a rise of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward effect came principally from restaurant and caf\u00e9 prices rising by more than a year ago. After falling into negative territory last year, Britain\u2019s inflation rate has now moved towards the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target: And this chart confirms that higher air fares cancelled out the impact of cheaper fuel. The pound has jumped by over half a cent against the US dollar, to around $1.43. Traders are calculating that higher-than-expected inflation figures could mean UK interest rates rise earlier than expected. Britain\u2019s core inflation rate, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, has hit 1.5%. That\u2019s the highest rate since October 2014, indicating that inflationary pressures are building. The early Easter holiday has helped to push inflation up. Holiday air fares rose in March compared to 2015 (when Easter was later). This is the highest UK inflation rate since December 2014, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index anyway. Breaking: Britain\u2019s annual inflation rate has jumped to 0.5% for March, up from 0.3% in February. That beats forecasts of a smaller rise, to 0.4%. More to follow..... The IMF has already cut its forecasts for growth this year several times, as RBS\u2019s economist team point out. Today\u2019s World Economic Outlook, due at 2pm BST, may include further gloom. Hopes that Greece and its creditors could make a breakthrough have been dashed overnight, probably to no-one\u2019s great surprise. Talks between the two sides were adjourned early this morning, and will resume next week once the IMF\u2019s Spring Meeting has concluded. Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters that: \u201cThe Greek government and the four institutions agreed there was progress,\u201d But clearly not enough progress to allow the first review of Greece\u2019s bailout to be wrapped up. There are still significant differences between the two sides, on issues such as pension reform and how to tackle bad loans. Tsakalotos says they\u2019re hoping for a deal by April 22nd. Endless talks. Delays. Postponements. It\u2019s all sounding a bit 2015.... Tax avoidance by multinational corporations will be forced into the open under proposals to be unveiled by European regulators later today following the Panama Papers revelations. The European commission will put forward legislation requiring large multinationals operating in Europe to disclose where they make profits and where they pay tax on a country by country basis. Companies trading in Europe, including large subsidiaries of non-European businesses, would also have to publish how much tax they pay outside the EU with specific information about tax paid in problematic jurisdictions..... Here\u2019s the full story: Shares in luxury goods makers are sliding across Europe this morning, following disappointing results from France\u2019s LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE. Last night, LVMH warned that last November\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris had hit sales in the last quarter. It reported a 4% rise in sales to \u20ac8.62bn; analysts had expected \u20ac8.73bn. LVMH, which owns champagne house Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon and cognac label Hennessy, as well as Louis Vuitton, told shareholders: \u201cThe U.S. market is strong and Europe remains well oriented except for France which is affected by a fall in tourism.\u201d LVMH\u2019s shares have fallen by 3.5% this morning, while Hermes has lost 1.5% and Burberry has shed 1.7%. Troubled UK supermarket chain Tesco has cut back one of its overseas ventures, as it looks to bolster its position back home. Tesco has sold an 8.6% stake in southeast Asian online retailer Lazada to China\u2019s Alibaba Group, raising just over \u00a390m (and giving Alibaba a controlling stake). That could give CEO Dave Lewis a little more firepower for price cuts, in his battle against discount supermarkets. The City isn\u2019t too impressed, though - Tesco\u2019s shares are down 1.6%. London\u2019s stock market has opened cautiously, with the FTSE 100 index dropping by 8 points in early trading. Mining shares are up, partly helped by the weaker dollar. But retailers are falling after a new survey showed that sales fell last month, as wet weather put shoppers off. Jack Lew, the US treasury secretary, has turned the tables on the International Monetary Fund by arguing that it must do more to help the global economy recover. Lew called out the IMF in a speech last night, saying it must be \u2018modernised\u2019. He urged it to: ...intensify scrutiny of critical issues like exchange rates, current account imbalances, and shortfalls in global aggregate demand In other words, he wants the Fund to criticise countries who fuel currency wars or destabilise the global economy by running large trade deficits [such as Britain] or surpluses [Germany, perhaps]. Quite a challenge to the IMF, which likes to use its Spring Meetings to tell everyone else whet they\u2019re doing wrong. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has poured cold water on hopes that a global tax authority could be introduced, to combat tax evasion. Speaking in Washington overnight, she warned that the idea of an intergovernmental UN tax body \u2013 promoted by Oxfam \u2013 faced major obstacles from governments. Lagarde argues: \u201cWe need to be aware of the massive hurdles and obstacles along the way because taxation for the last century or so has been defined, conceptualised, designed, implemented on a purely territorial sovereign basis. And if anything, levying taxation is considered as an attribute of sovereignty, and anything that takes away from that is going to be very strongly opposed by many countries in the world, many forces.\u201d Having said that, Lagarde concedes that the current situation really won\u2019t do. \u201cI think it\u2019s an area where we all have to think outside the box because there are too many boxes in that tax field and thinking outside the box might be of great interest.\u201d More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s an important week for the global economy, as policymakers head to Washington for the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The IMF will be setting the scene today, with its latest World Economic Outlook (at 2pm London time) \u2013 and it\u2019s likely to warn that economic conditions have weakened again. Economists expect the Fund to downgrade its growth forecasts, along with another warning that governments must do more to improve economic conditions. We also get the latest UK inflation figures at 9.30am BST. Inflation remains a rare and illusive beast in advanced economies, but analysts reckon the UK consumer prices index could rise to 0.4%, from 0.3%. A stronger reading might give the pound a lift. We\u2019ll also be watching Italy, where the government has just hammered out a \u20ac5bn fund to support its weaker banks. It also committed to improving bankruptcy rules, to make it quicker and easier to resolve a failing business. Officials are hoping that the plan will ease concerns over the stability of the Italian banking sector, following sharp declines in bank shares recently. And tax is also on the agenda. The European Commission is expected to announce plans to force multinational companies in Europe to reveal all their profits, and tax bills, filed in offshore havens. The plan, which has been in the works for months, has been given renewed impetus by the recent Panama Papers revelations. Here\u2019s a preview:",

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Buy-to-let mortgages increased by 11.5% last year and now account for 17% of the stock of total secured lending, twice the proportion of a decade ago. The PRA has just reviewed the plans of the 31 top lenders in the industry, representing over 90% of total buy-to-let lending. The Review revealed that some banks were applying weaker standards and highlighted the risk that more might do so to meet aggressive growth plans. In response, the PRA has clarified its expectations for buy-to-let underwriting standards and introduced new guidelines for minimum stressed interest rates to be used when lenders test affordability. </p> <p>Given the combination of this prudent reinforcement of underwriting standards and major tax changes now coming into force, the FPC has decided to take no further action at this stage but will continue to monitor potential threats to financial stability from buy-to-let. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-19T14:45:29.470Z\">at

downturn in March raises some questions, says Rob Carnell of ING:</p> <blockquote> <p>With talk of recession in the US economy beginning to gain traction again ahead of what will probably be a very weak first quarter GDP release next week (just after the April Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee meeting), we are looking for evidence on either side of the argument to help us update our forecasts and confirm or deny the recession argument.</p> <p>We feel the evidence for recession is quite circumstantial, with both weak and strong patches within the US economy. But one of those stronger patches has been the US home building sector, and this has taken a big dent in March. </p> <p>Housing starts fell by 8.8% month on month in March, with permits falling 7.7% month on month. Both single family and multifamily home starts were down sharply, though thanks to strong growth in January and February, this will merely dampen the boost to first quarter GDP growth from residential construction, not overturn it.</p> <p>But with permits providing a forward indication for weak second quarter residential construction, our conviction that what we are seeing is just one of the usual soft-patches in US data, not anything more alarming, is coming under pressure.</p> <p>We have been consistently below the recently cut consensus forecasts for US GDP growth (2.0% for 2016) and remain so even now (ING forcast 1.9%for 2016). But the likelihood of a really weak first quarter 2016 GDP forecast means that we will almost inevitably have to trim our figures further. Something closer to 1.5% for the full-year would be more consistent with the sorts of numbers published for first quarter GDP by the NowCasters, even assuming a recovery to the 2-2.5% range for the rest of the year. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5716299de4b057c2bbe00b2d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-19T13:07:43.877Z\">2.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"48de6419de9c55feb4f546d1e3d873da494252b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48de6419de9c55feb4f546d1e3d873da494252b2/0_0_2000_1250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Argentina flag\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Argentina is about to make a triumphant return to the bond markets, 15 years after defaulting on its debts.</strong></p> <p>After being swamped with interest, Buenos Aires has bumped up its new sale of three, five, 10 and 30-year bonds. </p> <p>It initially planned to raise $15bn, but is now going to sell<strong> $16.5bn</strong> of debt after receiving $65bn of bids from investors hungry for returns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BTabrum/status/722406306565472256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That Argentine deal &#39;capped at $15bn&#39; is in fact going to be $16.5bn</p>&mdash; Burnett Tabrum (@BTabrum) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BTabrum/status/722406306565472256\">April 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a victory for Argentine President Mauricio Macri, who has worked hard to reach a deal with the country\u2019s lenders - such as vulture funds who bought Argentinian debt after its defaulted.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/argentina-reaches-deal-debt-vulture-funds-mediator-155544401.html?ref=gs\">Cutting a deal with such predatory investors can\u2019t be pleasant</a>, but it does allow Argentina to borrow from the markets again. </p> <p><strong>Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investment, argues it\u2019s an important development:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe success of the issue is seen as an endorsement of new president Macri, as it is a huge step forwards with regards to improving Argentina\u2019s financial credibility.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57162559e4b0585020da6e19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-19T12:43:31.406Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oh dear.

                "bodyText":"As oil prices continued to climb, as the strike in Kuwait outweighed concerns that the weekend meeting of producers failed to agree a cap on output, stock markets moved sharply higher once more. Commodity companies were among the leading risers, and positive results from the likes of L\u2019Oreal also helped sentiment. Silver soared as Chinese buyers moved in, dragging gold along with it. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said: Gold\u2019s rally this year is finally feeding through to silver, which jumped to a 10-month high today. It\u2019s partly a correction in the usual gold-silver trading ratio, as silver has been lagging gold a bit this year and investors feel it needs to catch up. This could be a trend that continues. Longer term silver ought to outperform gold through better fundamentals as it has more industrial uses. The FTSE 100 hit a new fourth month high, reaching its best level since early December, while the MSCI All World index hit a similar peak. French and German markets remained strong, despite some less convincing gains on Wall Street. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 51.83 points or 0.82% at 6405.35 Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 2.27% to 10,349.59 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.32% higher at 4566.48 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.49% to 18,447.98 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.01% better at 8971.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.78% to 578.85 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 23 points or 0.13% higher. Meanwhile Brent crude is up 2.54% at $44 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. To sum up, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned in a Lords committee that leaving the EU could lead to lower economic growth. He defended the Bank commenting on the referendum, saying it was its duty to weigh up the implications of Britain\u2019s membership, but that did not mean it was getting involved in politics. He said UK interest rates could get closer to zero, but said he had no appetite for negative rates. He played down fears of a new round of complex financial instruments similar to those which caused the crash, but said the bank continued to monitor the risks. [And not everything on the original topics for discussion appeared to come up.....] And with that the session ends. Q: How will you pursue climate change agenda [after Paris agreement]? The most important aspect for the Bank is we are regulator of insurance, re-insurance sector. Climate change is one of most important things they have to manage, and they do it well. As regulator, we have to make sure they are on top of it. The bigger risk for financial system is the transition of regulatory environment to move to low carbon environment, and whether it is smooth or abrupt. We will not tell banks to have larger capital requirements if you lend to a larger carbon emitter, we will not put price on carbon. But if there is a prospect of meeting Paris agreement, there will be an adjustment for businesses. The basis point is there needs to be a market in transitions, appropriate disclosure by companies what there strategy is and what their carbon footprint is. Whatever your view, we are agnostic, but you can\u2019t express those views across broader financial world because you don\u2019t have the information Q: How high could interest rates go without doing damage? We do surveys on this. The good news is indebtedness is down. It would have an impact, it\u2019s been a long time since interest rates have moved up. But the position has undoubtedly improved. And when banks are making mortgage decisions, they have affordability tests, including if interest rates go up. Q: Any forward guidance on when we\u2019ll hit 2%? No. [laughs] Q: On the housing market, lenders are edging up to higher loan to value lending, are you still concerned about housing market. The indebtedness of British households has gone down but it still high. It is one of the major risks we watch at MPC, and we watch higher loan to value. Q: what is the risk of house prices coming down in London. We don\u2019t look at housing prices, we look at indebtedness, says Carney. At the higher end [of the London housing market] there has been a move, in terms of negative interest [in property], which could feed through to prices. But I [repeat] there is a degree of uncertainty ahead of EU vote. On productivity Carney says a lack of confidence in future growth is an increasing drag on productivity and investment in the UK and other major countries. Q: Are economic statistics fit for purpose? I commend Charlie Beans review of ONS. It addresses a number of everyday issues where ONS could improve. We work closely with ONS. The most interesting thing of the review is where it draws attention to the undermeasurement of the digital economy. 30 basis points of growth could be missed because of mismeasurement. One of the components of the report is to give ONS greater access to the data we have, subject to confidentiality. Q: So is the CPI an accurate reflection of inflation? We had concerns of move to CPIH, housing move, because we had concerns about rental market. We have to continue to update the inflation basket, he says, but we do have confidence CPI is representative of inflation facing British households. Q: Hasn\u2019t QE caused some of these problems? Is there a danger you will move bubbles elsewhere? This economy has needed monetary stimulus for some time, since the crisis, says Carney. The degree of stimulus has often been less than it appeared; relative to where interest rates needed to go, stimulus has been modest. [With low interest rates] this is an environment where risk can build, in housing market, in infrastructure. We have to act to take out risk where we can. On buy to let, we decided not to take additional action. Tax changes have been considerable, and we want to see how that plays out. These risks build up, we have to be nimble about them. Q: Before the crash banks were issuing very complex instruments. Are you concerned there are trillions of dollars worth of very similar instruments backed by corporate loans in last few years? Instruments which were most problematic were securitisations of securitisations, Carney says. Single securitisation is a reasonable financial instrument But any time something in finance grows rapidly, we should look at it. That\u2019s why we are looking at buy to let because its growing rapidly. Are you confident its not a repeat [of previous problems]? More likely to relate to underlying creditworthiness of issuing entities. Q: Your predecessor said regulation has become too complex. It has become enormous, what is your view. UK is one of most advanced economies in world, a highly complex economy. This isn\u2019t a simple world of barter and agrarian economies, and we shouldn\u2019t go back to that. Banks need to perform functions [which are complex]. The question with regulation whether we blend it with simpler cross checks and take out complexity where we can and with judgement [rather than box ticking]. Part of this process of addressing too complex to fail, is about making sure the institution itself is resolvable - ringfencing is one example. Q: So does regulation make common sense? The common sense elements are the decisive elements. There are some unhelpful and complex regulations, but we have to strip them out. Question: What challenges to financial stability do you see from integration of euro area? What is your assessment of negative interest rates? What do you think of helicopter money? There is a risk is that the process of deepening integration [could] restrict our ability to do our job and deliver financial stability. Crucial to recognise this is a multi-currency union, there must be different degrees of integration, national authorities must have flexibility. We think we could move base rate closer to zero but have not said we have an appetite for negative interest rates. I am not a believer in concept of helicopter money. In effect a central bank cancels debt that is purchased [from government], it puts a hole in its bank sheet. Government never has to recapitalise bank. We create a fundamental problem with reserves on which we have to pay interest, which is not a problem when rates are low, but becomes one when take away stimulus. We do not have an asset on the other side, you end up with a compounded ponzi scheme. Q: are you saying London would be less dominant financial centre if we left the EU. Depends on the negotiations, says Carney, but it is less likely London would remain as a pre-eminent financial centre [if UK left]. City of London unlikely to be enhanced [by Brexit]. Q: Do you agree with Chancellor that Brexit would lead to higher mortgages? Did he consult with Bank? Chancellor did not consult, he is not a member of the MPC, says Carney. There are scenarios where we could have lower GDP and higher inflation, which has implications in terms of higher bank rate, he says. A second factor is bank funding costs, which are passed on to consumers. Risk premium could increase after vote, he says, which would increase funding costs. So two factors which could have an effect and point in the direction of higher mortgage rates. Question: you said Chinese slowdown was greater risk to economy than EU referendum. Still agree? Yes, in medium term the issues are considerable, it depends how they are handled by Chinese authorities. Question: having a complicated financial system is inviting problems, but there is no real attempt to reduce complexity, is there? There are a series of reforms that have sought to reduce complexity, including ringfencing banking, says Carney. With Lehman and Bear Stearns it was not clear how they were linked, Carney indicates. Settling trades through central counterparties helps [with clarity]. On migration, Carney says that older workers staying longer in the workforce has swamped the effect of higher migration to the the UK. Net migration was likely to become more important as the effect of the increase in older workers is exhausted. The effects of migration on wage levels are not material for the Bank of England. More Carney on the uncertainties around the referendum: We will comment on these risks when we have a policy meeting and they come up, but we will not comment through the purdah period of the EU referendum campaign. A reminder: more on Carney\u2019s EU comments in the politics live blog: Carney says there is no intention for the Bank to provide a commentary on that or any other EU analysis. Lord Hollick asks his view on Monday\u2019s Treasury assessment. Carney says it is an analysis of a specific event rather than a Bank economic forecast. The Bank did not take part and it is up to the Treasury to discuss the analysis. But it is a sound analysis, the broad approach makes sense. Carney: Whatever the outcome of the Referendum, the MPC would use its tools to achieve its inflation remit, and, more broadly, the Bank\u2019s policy committees will work in concert, as One Bank, to promote monetary and financial stability. On the EU referendum, Carney says the Bank has not made and will not make any overall assessment of the economics of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. But he added: At the same time, the Bank must assess the implications of the UK\u2019s EU membership for our ability to achieve our core objectives of maintaining monetary and financial stability. The Bank has a duty to report our evidence-based judgments to Parliament and to the public. That is the fundamental standard of an open and transparent central bank. Assessing and reporting major risks does not mean becoming involved in politics; rather it would be political to suppress important judgments which relate directly to the Bank\u2019s remits and which influence our policy actions. These policy actions include developing, and if necessary implementing, contingency plans. As with the Scottish Referendum, we will communicate as much as is prudent about those plans in advance of any risk materialising and as comprehensively as possible once risks have dissipated. The Bank published a detailed, comprehensive report last year which reviewed the how EU membership affects the Bank of England\u2019s ability to achieve its objectives. And he added that there are risks: Some elements of these risks may be beginning to manifest. Since November, the trade-weighted value of sterling has fallen 10%, with more than half of that occurring since the MPC\u2019s last forecast in February. The cost of buying protection against a marked depreciation of sterling has risen notably, with sterling risk reversals falling to their lowest level in over a decade. He added: A vote to leave the EU might result in an extended period of uncertainty about the economic outlook, including about the prospects for export growth. This uncertainty would be likely to push down on demand in the short run. Carney is talking about the housing market, and says growth in mortgage lending is driven solely by the buy to let market. He said: Buy-to-let mortgages increased by 11.5% last year and now account for 17% of the stock of total secured lending, twice the proportion of a decade ago. The PRA has just reviewed the plans of the 31 top lenders in the industry, representing over 90% of total buy-to-let lending. The Review revealed that some banks were applying weaker standards and highlighted the risk that more might do so to meet aggressive growth plans. In response, the PRA has clarified its expectations for buy-to-let underwriting standards and introduced new guidelines for minimum stressed interest rates to be used when lenders test affordability. Given the combination of this prudent reinforcement of underwriting standards and major tax changes now coming into force, the FPC has decided to take no further action at this stage but will continue to monitor potential threats to financial stability from buy-to-let. The session is underway. My colleague Andrew Sparrow will be following Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s comments on Brexit at the Lords committee in the politics live blog: Carney\u2019s appearance before the Lords can be seen live here. Mark Carney is up before the House of Lords economic affairs committee this afternoon in its annual meeting with the Bank of England governor. Here\u2019s a quick look at what is expected to be on the agenda: US markets have made a mixed start in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 31 points or 0.18% following the positive lead from Europe and Asia. But Nasdaq has dipped 21 points or 0.47%. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs, which has just reported a drop in revenues and earnings, is up nearly 1%. Gold and silver continue to gain ground, mainly driven by a weak dollar and Chinese buying. Gold is up 2% to a one week high of $1255 an ounce while silver - the main beneficiary of Chinese demand - has jumped 5% to a ten month high of $17.07 an ounce. US housing has been one of the stronger areas of the economy, so a downturn in March raises some questions, says Rob Carnell of ING: With talk of recession in the US economy beginning to gain traction again ahead of what will probably be a very weak first quarter GDP release next week (just after the April Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee meeting), we are looking for evidence on either side of the argument to help us update our forecasts and confirm or deny the recession argument. We feel the evidence for recession is quite circumstantial, with both weak and strong patches within the US economy. But one of those stronger patches has been the US home building sector, and this has taken a big dent in March. Housing starts fell by 8.8% month on month in March, with permits falling 7.7% month on month. Both single family and multifamily home starts were down sharply, though thanks to strong growth in January and February, this will merely dampen the boost to first quarter GDP growth from residential construction, not overturn it. But with permits providing a forward indication for weak second quarter residential construction, our conviction that what we are seeing is just one of the usual soft-patches in US data, not anything more alarming, is coming under pressure. We have been consistently below the recently cut consensus forecasts for US GDP growth (2.0% for 2016) and remain so even now (ING forcast 1.9%for 2016). But the likelihood of a really weak first quarter 2016 GDP forecast means that we will almost inevitably have to trim our figures further. Something closer to 1.5% for the full-year would be more consistent with the sorts of numbers published for first quarter GDP by the NowCasters, even assuming a recovery to the 2-2.5% range for the rest of the year. Argentina is about to make a triumphant return to the bond markets, 15 years after defaulting on its debts. After being swamped with interest, Buenos Aires has bumped up its new sale of three, five, 10 and 30-year bonds. It initially planned to raise $15bn, but is now going to sell $16.5bn of debt after receiving $65bn of bids from investors hungry for returns. It\u2019s a victory for Argentine President Mauricio Macri, who has worked hard to reach a deal with the country\u2019s lenders - such as vulture funds who bought Argentinian debt after its defaulted. Cutting a deal with such predatory investors can\u2019t be pleasant, but it does allow Argentina to borrow from the markets again. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investment, argues it\u2019s an important development: \u201cThe success of the issue is seen as an endorsement of new president Macri, as it is a huge step forwards with regards to improving Argentina\u2019s financial credibility.\u201d Oh dear. The number of new US house-building projects fell by almost 9% in March, new data shows. Residential housing starts decreased 8.8% to an annual rate of 1.09 million, the lowest since October, according to the Commerce Department. And the number of permits to build a new house also fell, by almost 8%, suggesting America\u2019s construction sector suffered falling demand last month. Traders are selling the US dollar as a result, on the grounds that an early US interest rate rise is less likely. The last three months certainly weren\u2019t a vintage quarter for Goldman Sachs: Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs, says the last three months have been pretty tough. He told shareholders that profits fell over 50% because: \u201cThe operating environment this quarter presented a broad range of challenges, resulting in headwinds across virtually every one of our businesses. \u201cLooking ahead, we will continue to focus on delivering superior service to our clients and managing our business efficiently, which remain essential to generating shareholder value over the long term.\u201d Those \u201cchallenges\u201d includes a drop-off in deal-making (bad for investment bankers), and less demand for share trading from clients due to recent economic uncertainty. This is the fourth consecutive quarterly fall in Goldman\u2019s profits, as its bond traders and investment bankers suffer from tough market conditions. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to Goldman Sachs\u2019 big fall in revenues and profits in the last quarter. https://twitter.com/MattCampbel/status/722390203634159616 Here come Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial results for the last quarter! Goldman has post a big drop in revenues, down from $10.6bn last year to $6.34bn. That\u2019s weaker than the $6.73bn which analysts had expected. And earnings have more than halved during the quarter, at $2.68 per share compared to $5.94 per share in January-March 2015. That beats expectations of $2.45 per share. Goldmand\u2019s income from investment banking income fell by almost a quarter, to $1.46bn. Equities trading suffered a similar decline, to $1.78bn. And CEO Lloyd Blankfein is blunt about market conditions, given market volatility and the lack of big merger deals. Blankfein says Goldman faced a \u201cbroad range of challenges\u201d, with headwinds in almost every one of its business areas. Global stock markets have hit their highest level since last December. The rally in Europe and Asia today, and on Wall Street last night, has pushed MSCI\u2019s All-Country World Stocks index to a four-month high. It\u2019s gained around 12% since early February, when investors were panicking about the slowdown in China and the stability of some European banks. Quite a turnaround, and vindication for those commentators who argued that shareholders should sit tight. The European Commission is gearing up to hit Google with fresh anti-competitive charges, over its Android mobile phone operating system, it appears. The word in Brussels is that European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager could unveil formal antitrust charges on Wednesday. She\u2019s likely to accuse Google of abusing Android\u2019s dominance to give its own apps an unfair advantage against rivals. The case could echo the clashes with Microsoft more than a decade ago, when Brussels took issue with the software giant\u2019s domination of the desktop PC business. The German stock market is roaring ahead today, jumping by 220 point or 2.2%. Traders in Frankfurt were spurred into action by this morning\u2019s ZEW index, showing a leap in German economic confidence. German manufacturers are leading the rally, such as skincarer maker Beiersdorf (+3.8%), chipmaker Infineon Technologies (+3.3%), and chemicals firm BASF (+2.6%). And Europe\u2019s rally is likely to feed through to New York in a few hours time, potentially pushing the Dow Jones index to a new nine-month high. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the morning: Doha what? After Monday\u2019s rather tentative trading following the lack of oil action over the weekend the markets have leapt into life this Tuesday, hitting a bevy of fresh highs in the process. The main thrust of the morning\u2019s growth came from the Eurozone, the catalyst for this surge being the day\u2019s ZEW economic sentiment figures. With the German number coming in at 11.2 (against 8.2 expected and 4.3 last month) and the region-wide data at 21.5 (vastly higher than the 13.9 forecast and the 10.6 seen last month) confidence is picking up, despite the very real threat of a Brexit AND a worsening assessment of the German economy. This was the green light the DAX needed to roar in to life, jumping by over 200 points to 10350, within a 150 leap away from a fresh 2016 peak. Greece\u2019s government is resuming talks with its lenders this afternoon over its economic reforms, as the Greek debt crisis threatens to heat up. It\u2019s the first meeting since the International Monetary Fund pushed for Greece\u2019s bailout to be rewritten, to remove unachievable fiscal targets. Greece hasn\u2019t yet convinced its creditors that it has done enough to quality for debt relief, as they wrangle over bad debt rules and pension reforms. The creditors are understood to be pushing for Greece to sign up to extra austerity, in case the bailout programme goes off course. The Wall Street Journal explains: The package would be triggered only if Greece falls short of targets over the next three years. But the proposals, which come on top of a list of austerity measures already being negotiated, would have to be passed into law now\u2014posing a stiff test for the governing coalition of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, which has a majority of only three seats in parliament. Economic expectations in German has smashed forecasts, despite worries about Britain\u2019s EU referendum. The ZEW Institute\u2019s German economic sentiment index has surged to 11.2 this month, up from just 4.3 in March. Analysts had expected economic expectations (or Konjunkturerwartungen) to rise to 8. ZEW says recent \u201csurprisingly positive economic news\u201d from China has given investors more confidence about future prospects [Chinese exports surged in February, while the economy grew by a decent 6.7% in the last quarter]. However, German investors are less optimistic about their domestic economy. ZEW says: The assessment of the economic situation in Germany worsened. The index has fallen by 3.0 points and now stands at 47.7 points. And ZEW\u2019s Professor Dr. Sascha Steffen remains cautious, especially with Britain\u2019s Brexit referendum looming. The bottom line, however, the continuing weak growth in China and other key emerging markets remain a burden on the German export industry. The concern about a possible withdrawal from the EU Britain is likely to affect burdensome.\u201d Niels Christensen, foreign exchange strategist at Nordea, says the recovery in oil has sent confidence gushing through the markets: He says (via Reuters) \u201cIt is quite amazing how oil prices have recovered from Monday\u2019s lows. That is shoring up risk appetite and pushing up commodity-linked currencies. \u201cAs long as oil remains above $43 a barrel we think commodity currencies will remain supported.\u201d Brent is currently trading at $43.24 per barrel.... That \u2018party on, dudes\u2019 feeling has driven European stock markets to three-month highs. Consumer goods firms are leading the way after France\u2019s L\u2019Oreal posted solid sales and profit figures this morning. Miners are also up, reflecting the weaker US dollar, while banks are benefitting from more optimism about emerging market economies. This has sent the Stoxx 600 index, the broad measure of European shares, to its highest level since January. And the FTSE 100 is still at its highest level since December, as the City shows some sunny optimism. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explains why: \u201cEquity markets are handsomely positive this morning, still benefiting from the oil price rebound as supply disruption from a Kuwaiti strike helps offsets the (misplaced) weekend disappointment from Doha. A weak US dollar following dovish Fed commentary is also keeping commodities and their miners bid while a Dow Jones back at 9-month highs 18,000 and a decent US earnings season so far is maintaining risk appetite. Equities continue to extend their gains from 2016 lows taking headwinds in the stride and preferring to focus on the positives. The workers\u2019 strike that has halved Kuwait\u2019s oil output looks terribly civilised, judging by these photos from Sunday: The oil workers are protesting against cuts to pay and benefits, which Kuwait is enforcing after the slump in oil revenues played havoc with its budget. The Kuwaiti government has urged workers to return to duty, and threatened legal action against the \u201cinstigators\u201d of the walkout. But analysts predict that a compromise will be found. Consultancy group Eurasia says: \u201cSensitive to union pressure, the government is likely to compromise on most of striking oil workers\u2019 pay demands. In the coming days oil production is likely to partially recover from its initial drop as non-striking staff is redistributed and inventories drawn upon. Two of Europe\u2019s better known lager brands are changing hands, as part of the latest mega-deal in the brewing industry. Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev is selling Peroni and Grolsch to Japan\u2019s Asahi (the firm behind Super Dry beer), to help smooth its takeover of SAB Miller. London craft brewer Meantime is also being sold to Asahi, less than a year after SAB snapped up the fast-growing company... More here: Sterling crisis, what sterling crisis? The pound has gained almost half a cent this morning to $1.4319, a one-week high. This follows a new opinion poll, giving the Remain campaign a nine point lead in June\u2019s in-out EU referendum. It\u2019s a telephone poll too, which are seen as more accurate (or possibly \u2018less inaccurate\u2019 would be safer) The FTSE 100 has just hit its highest level of the year, up 42 points at 6395. Precious metal prices are rising this morning too. Gold has gained 1% to $1,246 per ounce, while silver has jumped by 3% to a 10-month high. Again, that\u2019s partly due to the weakening US dollar. It has lost ground against most commodity-linked currencies today, reflecting the recovery in the oil price. European stock markets are rising at the start of trading, following Asia\u2019s lead. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 23 points, or 0.4%, to 6377 points. Mining stocks are packing the list of top risers, with Anglo American up 4% and Fresnillo and Glencore both gaining 3%. That\u2019s partly because the US dollar is weaker this morning, which pushes up commodity prices. Investors are also welcoming today\u2019s recovery in the oil price, as Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale explains: Brent crude at $40 per baarrel has done a good job of rejecting the notion that without production cuts it\u2019s going to hell in a hand basket. Unless we can un-invent the technology gains of the last few years we won\u2019t see dramatic upside and if the upshot is that oil prices settle into a range and better still, the correlation between non oil-producing countries currencies and the price of oil falls away, then that\u2019s even better. In the meantime, the oil market\u2019s willingness to get back to business as usual has been greeted by a loud cry of \u2018Party On, Dudes\u2019 in equity markets. An \u2018excellent\u2019 film reference from Kit... Yesterday\u2019s oil price slide has been completely wiped out: The recovery in the oil price has helped to drive stock markets higher in Asia. Japan\u2019s Nikkei led the way with a 3.7% rally, helped by the yen weakening against the US dollar (good news for Japanese exporters). That wipes out yesterday\u2019s selloff, when investors sold heavily following the huge earthquakes that killed at least 42 people and shuttered factories. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/500 index gained 1%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng finished 0.8% higher, and there were small gains in Shanghai too. This pushed the MSCI index of Asian markets to its highest level since last November. Asian investors were also cheered by the sight of the US stock market rallying last night. Hiroki Allen, of Superfund Securities Japan says: \u201cThe effects of the Dow reaching a nine-month high created a buying trend that helped lift the Nikkei today.\u201d The oil price is rallying this morning as world markets put the debacle of Sunday\u2019s Opec meeting behind them. Brent crude has risen to $43.23, up 0.75%, adding to last night\u2019s late rally. US crude oil is up almost 1%, back over $40. The rally appears to be driven by industrial action in Kuwait, where oil workers have been on strike since Sunday in a protest against public sector reforms which will cut their earnings. The walkout has slashed Kuwait\u2019s output by 60%, or 1.7 million barrels per day -- effectively eliminating the surplus crude in world markets. This has taken traders\u2019 minds off the deadlock between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which scuppered attempts to freeze output last weekend. Ironically, Kuwait\u2019s oil workers have done what the oil ministers and governors of Opec failed to achieve. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today, we get a new healthcheck on economic confidence in Europe\u2019s largest economy, and hear from the UK\u2019s top central banker. Germany ZEW index, released at 10am BST, is expected to show that economic sentiment among German investors and analysts rose this month, following the recent recovery in the markets. That will help set the scene for the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, will give his own view of the general economic outlook this afternoon. He\u2019s testifying to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee from 3.30pm. On the agenda: China\u2019s econony, the risks posed by Britain\u2019s EU referendum, and the revelations in the Panama Papers. On the corporate front, we\u2019ll get results from Goldman Sachs at 12.30pm BST. The Wall Street titan is tipped to post lower revenues and profits, as IB Times explains: The bank, which recently agreed to pay out over $5 billion to settle allegations related to the sale of subprime mortgage to investors between 2005 and 2007, is also forecast to report a 36.6 percent year-on-year drop in revenue, to $6.73 billion in the first three months of 2016 from $10.6 billion. Goldman\u2019s pretax profit is also expected to take a hit and is likely to drop to $1.87 billion from $3.93 billion in the first quarter of 2015. We also get some new US construction data at 1.30pm. That\u2019ll show how many new housing permits were granted last month, and how many actually started being built. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

The strike began on Sunday, coinciding with the breakdown of talks between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to freeze output.

So far the bulls are winning as a pile of negative news has failed to derail a rally which took hold in mid-February. This has been driven by hopes of an output freeze, dollar weakness and a suggestion that the supplies may come back into line with demand sooner than previously anticipated. But efforts to push WTI much beyond $42.50 have failed so far and it could be that the upside momentum is fading. If so, then a retest of $36 looks possible, particularly if more signs appear of a slowdown in global growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-571796d9e4b0b18037cf1ecc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-20T14:49:01.567Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FOREXcom/status/722798030353596417\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CrudeOil?src=hash\">#CrudeOil</a> pares earlier losses on slightly lower-than-expected US crude inventory build, despite end to Kuwaiti oil workers&#39; strike. ^JC</p>&mdash; FOREX.com (@FOREXcom) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FOREXcom/status/722798030353596417\">April 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-571792eee4b035ab5a57a8d3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-20T14:34:38.068Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US weekly crude stocks climb by less than expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US crude oil stocks rose by 2.1m barrels last week to 538.61m, lower than the 2.4m increase expected by analysts.</p> <p>But gasoline stocks fell by 110,000 barrels compared to a forecast 1.2m decline.</p> <p>Gasoline demand over the past four weeks was up 3.9% from a year ago.</p> <p>Stockpiles of distillate, which includes diesel and heating oil, fell by 3.6m barrels compared to expectations of a 304,000 increase.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-20T14:44:15.593Z\">at 3.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57178bcfe4b0570550fd119b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-20T14:14:36.260Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US home sale rebound</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After weak US housing starts data on Tuesday came signs that the market may not be that bad after all.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2016/04/existing-home-sales-spring-ahead-in-march\">Existing home sales</a></strong> jumped 5.1% in March to a better than expected 5.33m units.

The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 4.91 points or 0.08% higher at 6410.26 after spending most of the day in negative territory Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.69% to 10,421.29 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.56% at 4591.92 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.14% to 18,658.36 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.96% at 9147.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.63% to 582.51 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 50 points or 0.3% higher. Meanwhile Brent crude is up 1.5% at $44.7 a barrel. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over to Greece and there are some signs of optimism ahead of this week\u2019s eurogroup meeting and amid talk of a second get-together next week: Although: And here\u2019s that recent jump in the oil price: Oil is now in positive territory after its earlier falls, in the wake of the smaller than expected rise in US crude stocks. There is also unsubstantiated talk of another meeting of producers within weeks to discuss an output freeze again, despite the failure of the weekend\u2019s meeting to reach any agreement. Brent is now up 0.18% at $44.11 a barrel. David Morrison, market strategist at Spreadco, said: Oil bounced off its lows following the latest inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). This showed a smaller-than-expected build in stockpiles, and a reduction from the previous week. Crude was lower in early trade today on the news that a strike by Kuwaiti oil workers had come to an end. The strike began on Sunday, coinciding with the breakdown of talks between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to freeze output. There was additional downside pressure on prices due to data from the American Petroleum Institute which showed that US inventories rose by 3.1 million barrels on expectations of a 2.4 million barrel increase. There\u2019s a real tug-of-war going on now between bulls and bears with the line in the sand being $40 for front-month WTI. So far the bulls are winning as a pile of negative news has failed to derail a rally which took hold in mid-February. This has been driven by hopes of an output freeze, dollar weakness and a suggestion that the supplies may come back into line with demand sooner than previously anticipated. But efforts to push WTI much beyond $42.50 have failed so far and it could be that the upside momentum is fading. If so, then a retest of $36 looks possible, particularly if more signs appear of a slowdown in global growth. US crude oil stocks rose by 2.1m barrels last week to 538.61m, lower than the 2.4m increase expected by analysts. But gasoline stocks fell by 110,000 barrels compared to a forecast 1.2m decline. Gasoline demand over the past four weeks was up 3.9% from a year ago. Stockpiles of distillate, which includes diesel and heating oil, fell by 3.6m barrels compared to expectations of a 304,000 increase. After weak US housing starts data on Tuesday came signs that the market may not be that bad after all. Existing home sales jumped 5.1% in March to a better than expected 5.33m units. Analysts had expected an increase of 3.5%, and is a vast improvement on the 7.3% drop seen in February (itself revised down from the original 7.1% decline). The rise from March last year was 1.5%. Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors which released the figures, said: Closings came back in force last month as a greater number of buyers \u2013 mostly in the Northeast and Midwest \u2013 overcame depressed inventory levels and steady price growth to close on a home. Buyer demand remains sturdy in most areas this spring and the mid-priced market is doing quite well. However, sales are softer both at the very low and very high ends of the market because of supply limitations and affordability pressures. It\u2019s proving to be a bit of a mixed day on the markets. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up just 14 points in early trading, with Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 also marginally higher. German and French markets are also a few points better off but in the UK, the FTSE 100 has slipped 19 points or 0.3%. Meanwhile oil has come back from its worst levels, but Brent crude is still down 1.7i% at $43.28 a barrel as the Kuwait strike ended and attention turned back to the lack of agreement among oil producersat the weekend to cap output. Later come the latest US weekly crude inventories data. Back with the speech by MPC member Ian McCafferty, and a former member is not impressed: Thursday\u2019s meeting of the European Central Bank may not be as exciting as the March gathering, when interest rates were cut further and its bond buying programme was expanded. That is the view of Mads Koefoed of Saxo Bank, who says: [The] meeting of the governing council looks to be a sleepy affair with not much new coming to the surface. We may get some additional details on the corporate sector purchase programme (part of the \u20ac80bn monthly purchases), but otherwise the stage is set for Draghi to reiterate that the ECB stands ready to combat low inflation while expressing confidence in the measures announced last month. The ECB meeting always has the potential to be a market-mover, but this particular one looks destined to be a non-event. Will Draghi surprise? Again? On Brexit he said: Very recently there have been some signs that increased uncertainty linked to the outcome of the EU referendum to be held on 23 June may weigh on investment in coming months, such that we may see a slight softening in GDP growth through the summer, but our central projection for demand growth remains one of \u2018steady as she goes\u2019. Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty has said he will vote to raise rates again at some point, and there was no guarantee future rises would be gradual and limited. But he did not know when rates might rise due to the current uncertain economic outlook. In a speech at the Bank, he said: On the basis of our current central outlook for the UK economy, I still anticipate having to return to a vote to tighten monetary policy at some stage, although I cannot offer a firm date as to when that might occur \u2013 the uncertainty surrounding the evolution of the economy over the coming months is particularly acute at the moment. As a result, the long-standing guidance from the Monetary Policy Committee that we expect to raise interest rates in a gradual and limited fashion is not a promise \u2013 the actual path of monetary policy will, of course, depend on the performance of the economy. McCafferty voted to raise rates last August, and finally came round to the consensus view that they should be left unchanged in February. He warned that wage growth was being pushed down by low headline inflation, but could quickly begin rising once prices started going up again. Greece should not need extra measures to complete the bailout review with its lenders, according to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, although he admitted that the EU and IMF may have differing assessments about the state of the country\u2019s economy. Greece\u2019s Kathimerini reports: \u201cWe, as the Commission, are of the opinion that our figures are right and there is no need for contingency measures,\u201d Juncker said in an interview with euro2day.gr financial website made public Wednesday. \u201cMy impression is that the IMF does not believe in our figures,\u201d he added. The Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) is expected to announce on Thursday that the 2015 primary surplus was between 1.1 and 1.2 billion euros, or 0.6 to 0.7 percent of GDP. According to sources, the European Commission\u2019s statistical arm, Eurostat, has already rubber-stamped the data. IMF calculations, on the other hand, are based on the Fund\u2019s forecast that Greece produced a 0.5 percent of GDP deficit last year. \u201cWe have to wait for the figures to be published by Eurostat on Thursday,\u201d Juncker said. Asked about the implications of the differences between the EU and the IMF, Juncker said the two would have to \u201cbridge the gap.\u201d \u201cIf others are of the opinion that contingency measures are a way out of a situation and if these measures are proposed then we are ready to assess them,\u201d he said, adding that this would have to occur \u201cin close cooperation with the Greek government.\u201d In the same interview, the head of the Commission also criticized fresh speculation of a Greek exit from the eurozone. \u201cI don\u2019t think for one second that it would be wise and intelligent to restart this debate. Grexit did not happen and will not happen,\u201d Juncker said. Ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting on Thursday, something to cheer up president Mario Draghi. The ECB, Draghi in particular, has been criticised by a number of German bigwigs, notably finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble although he was later defended by the Bundesbank. Now another politician has come to his defence, reports Reuters: German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel leapt to the defense of the European Central Bank on Wednesday, saying it was time to stop bashing the bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, and instead up to governments to agree on measures to boost growth. Members of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives have complained loudly in recent weeks that the low-interest rate policies of the ECB are creating a \u201cgaping hole\u201d in savers\u2019 finances as returns have dropped. Some conservatives have called for the next ECB president to come from Germany. \u201cThis game of ECB bad guy - this must come to an end,\u201d Gabriel told a news conference in Berlin, the main highlight of which became his defense of the ECB rather than the advertised focus on growth forecasts. Gabriel is leader of Germany\u2019s centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), the junior coalition partner of Merkel\u2019s conservatives. \u201cIf you engage in the debate, you quickly realise that the problem is not the ECB and Mr Draghi but rather the lack of willingness to give up a focus purely on austerity,\u201d he said. A quick recap. The European Union has opened a new front against Google, accusing the software giant of harming competition in the mobile sector. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has said Google is harming innovation by forcing mobile operators to include its applications in return for access to its Play Store, and offering financial inducements. Google has denied the charge, insisting that Android is free and open source. Economists fear that Britain\u2019s jobs recovery is bottoming out, after the unemployment total jumped by 21,000. The claimant count also rose, while the jobless rate remains at 5.1%. Uncertainty over the EU Referendum outcome in June may be partly to blame, as firms cut back on investment. Financial markets have dipped, following recent solid gains. China led the way, with shares sliding on fears of a clampdown on credit. The oil price has fallen, after refinery workers in Kuwait ended a strike. Brent crude is down 1.5% at $43.38 per barrel, on fears that the oil glut will worsen. Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi has admitted manipulating test data to overstate the fuel efficiency of 625,000 cars. The EC\u2019s move has been welcomed by Fairsearch, a group of search services which brought the initial complaint against Google. Reuters has the details: FairSearch, the lead complainant, said Google had launched Android as an open source project, but was now hindering the development of versions that might lead to new operating systems able to compete with Android. This is the issue of \u2018forking\u2019, where a piece of software splits off into different versions. It\u2019s one of the reasons that open source software has been so successful over the last couple of decades, with developers creating new code which is then released back to the community. Today\u2019s complaint, though, claims that Google forces phone makers to enter into an \u201cAnti-Fragmentation Agreement\u201d that commits it not to sell devices running on Android forks. That prevents rival versions of Android springing up, critics argue. Google has swiftly responded to the European Commission\u2019s charges, insisting that Android is a \u201cfree and open-source operating system.\u201d It also denies forcing mobile phone makers to give its applications unfair treatment, as the EC claims today. Kent Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel, says: \u201cOur partner agreements are entirely voluntary,\u201d \u201cWe look forward to working with the European Commission to demonstrate the careful way we\u2019ve designed the Android model in a way that\u2019s good for competition and for consumers.\u201d Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 news story about the EC\u2019s latest clash with Google, which broke an hour ago. EU charges Google with abusing market dominance of Android Google found itself under fire again on Wednesday from EU antitrust regulators who say it abused the dominant position of its Android mobile operating system, a move which could hit a key money-spinner for the company. The charges by the European Commission open up a second battle with the world\u2019s most popular Internet search engine, putting it at risk of hefty fines and radical changes to its business practices. Google is already facing EU charges of promoting its own shopping service in Internet searches at the expense of rival products, a case which has dragged on since late 2010 and marked by three failed attempts to resolve the issues. The stakes are higher in the Android case for Google which made about $11 billion from ad sales on Android phones with Google apps such as Maps, Search and Gmail last year. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. \u201cA competitive mobile Internet sector is increasingly important for consumers and businesses in Europe. \u201cBased on our investigation thus far, we believe that Google\u2019s behavior denies consumers a wider choice of mobile apps and services and stands in the way of innovation by other players.\u201d It said about 80 percent of smart mobile devices in Europe and in the world run on Android, the mobile operating system developed by Google. Google has breached EU antitrust rules, the Commision alleges, by requiring manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and Google\u2019s Chrome browser and preventing manufacturers from selling mobile devices running on competing operating systems based on the Android open source code. It is also charged with giving financial incentives to manufacturers and network operators to pre-install exclusively Google search on devices. The Commission\u2019s case against Google is online, here: Antitrust: Commission sends Statement of Objections to Google on Android operating system and applications You cannot use Google\u2019s Play Store to buy another app store, Vestager points out. So it becomes quite tricky to find another shop to do your shopping. Google\u2019s success partly comes from making applications that are popular with many consumers, she continues, but it isn\u2019t allowed to abuse that position. Commissioner Vestager repeats that Google has hurt competition by forcing mobile phone makers to install its search applications and Chrome browser, in return for access to its Play Store. If you want innovation to happen, here should be an incentive to innovate, she says. One of the best motivations is to be able to present your innovations, your services to potential customers. That is what is at stake. Maybe it has become too difficult, or impossibe, for other search machines and other app stores to present themselves to the consumer Q: Why is the Commission not concerned about Apple\u2019s iPhone? Apple doesn\u2019t licence its operating system to other phone makers, Margrethe Vestager replies. Q: What remedy must Google provide? Could it just be a change of contract, or will Google need to make technical changes? The remedy is simple - to stop prices that are damaging innovation and competition, Vestager says. Yesterday, Canada closed an ant-trust investigation against Google, so why does Europe have a different view. asks Politico\u2019s Nicholas Hirst. Q: Is it targeting Google as part of its push to create a digital single market? Margrethe Vestager insists that the EU doesn\u2019t have a grudge against any particular company. We are responding to complaints. Q: How much damage has Google caused to the European economy? It\u2019s hard to say, Vestager replies, but the impact goes beyond simply the search area. It may be wide-ranging - stifling competition and hurting innovation in the wider tech space. We all want an innovative economy, she adds, but what\u2019s the point if companies don\u2019t have a level playing field? Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is briefing reporters in Brussels now. She says Google has played \u201cunjustified restrictions\u201d on mobile manufacturers, meaning some have chosen not to use applications from rival software makers. The European Commission claims that Google is breaking EU law by forcing mobile phone makers who use Android to give preferential treatment to Google applications. In today\u2019s Statement of Objections, the Commission alleges that Google is: requiring manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and Google\u2019s Chrome browser and requiring them to set Google Search as default search service on their devices, as a condition to license certain Google proprietary apps; preventing manufacturers from selling smart mobile devices running on competing operating systems based on the Android open source code; giving financial incentives to manufacturers and mobile network operators on condition that they exclusively pre-install Google Search on their devices. Newsflash: The European Commission has formally charged Google with breaking competition rules over its Android mobile operating system. Competition chief Margrethe Vestager has tweeted the news (from an iPhone) Here\u2019s our economics correspondent, Phillip Inman, on today\u2019s jobs report: The number of people out of work in Britain increased for the first time in seven months in February. In a signal that the referendum vote in June is having an impact on the economy, the latest labour market report showed that the unemployment total rose by 21,000 in the three months to February to 1.7 million. This was the first increase since last August but left the headline unemployment rate unchanged at 5.1%. The claimant count, which measures people receiving out of work benefits, jumped by 6,700 in March. This is also the first increase since August 2015. In a further blow to the government\u2019s efforts to keep the economy growing strongly, wage growth including bonuses fell from 2.1% in January to 1.8% . The measure of wages excluding bonuses remained at 2.2%..... More here: John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says the rise in unemployment shows that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s EU referendum are hurting the economy: \u201cThe UK economy has been a great job creating machine for most of the past three years, but the latest data suggest that this has levelled off over the past three months.... These latest data are consistent with other evidence that UK growth slowed somewhat during the first quarter of 2016, reflecting a more fragile global economy and uncertainty related to the EU Referendum outcome in June. Time will tell whether this proves to be a temporary blip or a more pronounced slowdown, although our main scenario is still that the UK will achieve GDP growth of around 2% this year with the unemployment rate remaining around 5%.\u201d Professor Geraint Johnes of Lancaster University Management School and The Work Foundation also believes Britain\u2019s labour market is slowing. He says: \u201cUnemployment is 21000 up on the quarter, but employment is also 20000 up, with a fall in labour market inactivity. Amongst employees in employment, there has been a fall in full-time numbers of 34000 and a rise in part-time of 11000 - suggesting something of a slowdown. The big news, though, is the fall in wage growth - which worsened in February. For total pay on the single month measure, this is down from 2.6% to 1.1%. The big slowdown here is in finance. Pay in construction is still steaming ahead, at 8.6% over the course of the year. This chart shows how average earnings growth has come off the boil recently: Today\u2019s report also shows the stark regional imbalances across Britain\u2019s jobs market: Mariano Mamertino, economist at job site Indeed, fears that the UK\u2019s referendum on European Union membership has pushed the unemployment total up: Mamertino says: \u201cModest though it is, the increase in unemployment is a deeply worrying sign that the UK economy\u2019s ability to create new jobs is running out of steam. \u201cUnemployment remains at a historically low level, but the lengthening dole queue is a warning of trouble ahead. \u201cThe combination of strengthening economic headwinds, and the political uncertainty triggered by the Brexit referendum, is having a dramatic cooling effect on employers\u2019 appetite to hire. \u201cAt the end of March, just a month on from the confirmation of the Brexit referendum, the number of live job postings by UK employers on our site had fallen across all 13 major sectors. \u201cThis is in sharp contrast to February, when job postings increased across the board. Stephen Crabb, the new Work and Pensions Secretary, has commented on today\u2019s jobs report (but not mentioned the jump in unemployment). \u201cWe remain in a position of strength, with a record employment rate, wages continuing to grow steadily and three-quarters of a million vacancies available in the labour market. \u201cWork is essential in transforming the lives of the most disadvantaged people in society and is at the heart of our welfare reforms. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring that everyone across the country benefits from our strong economy and the opportunities this brings.\u201d The rise in unemployment in the last quarter may show that Britain\u2019s jobs recovery is bottoming out. Nick Palmer, statistician at the Office for National Statistics, says: \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to be certain but, with unemployment up for the first time since mid-2015, and employment seeing its slowest rise since that period, it\u2019s possible that recent improvements in the labour market may be easing off.\u201d The employment rate has strengthened pretty steadily for the last four years, but has been hovering around 74% since the last quarter of 2015: The UK labour market appears to be \u2018softening\u2019, warns Duncan Weldon, the head of research at Resolution Group. Marc Ostwald, analyst at ADM Investor Services, says today\u2019s data is \u201cvery poor\u201d The number of people in work across Britain has also gone up. The employment total rose by 20,000 in the last quarter, to 31.41m, and is 360,000 higher than a year ago. The number of people out of work in Britain has risen for the first time in seven months. The latest labour market report, just released, shows that the unemployment total rose by 21,000 in the December-February quarter to 1.70 million. It\u2019s the first rise since last May-July. That leaves the headline unemployment rate unchanged at 5.1%. The claimant count, which measures people receiving unemployment benefit, has jumped by 6,700 in March. This is also the first increase since August 2015. In another blow.... average wages including bonuses rose by just 1.8% during the quarter, down from 2.1% a month earlier. That may be due to a dropoff in City bonuses. Excluding bonuses, wage growth were unchanged at 2.2%. Reaction to follow..... Japanese carmaker Mitsubishi has just admitted that some employees have falsified data on emission tests to improve its vehicles\u2019 fuel economy. In an obvious echo of the Volkswagen emissions scandal, Mitsubishi says that the the false tests involves 625,000 cars, including some supplied to Nissan. Nissan discovered the issue and the two companies are discussing compensation, according to Bloomberg. The pound has dipped a little this morning, down 0.15% against the US dollar at $1.4370. This chart from Bloomberg\u2019s David Ingles, showing how sterling has already weakened against most major currencies this year, as the EU referendum casts a shadow of uncertainty. There\u2019s no escape from Brexit fears. Overnight, eight former US Treasury secretaries have warned that Britain would become a \u2018less relevant and less significant economy\u2019 if it leaves the European Union. European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is expected to announce new antitrust charges against Google at 10.30am BST (11.30am in Belgium). Brussels correspondents will be busy! Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, explains why ARM\u2019s shares are bucking the downturn: Arm is now shipping more than half of its chips to non-mobile markets, meaning the company\u2019s fortunes cannot simply be linked directly to the likes of Apple anymore. That\u2019s just as well for Arm, as it looks like shipments of Apple\u2019s iPhones nosedived in the first quarter. Slowing smartphone sales, particularly in China, don\u2019t seem to be as much as a problem as many would have thought. Arm seems well placed to ride out any relative decline in growth for Apple and other smartphone makers as it\u2019s good at innovating \u2013 vital within a fast-changing market.\u201d The car industry\u2019s test-rigging scandal may be deepening. Mitsubishi, the Japanese automaker, has found evidence of problems with its fuel economy test results. A spokesman says: \u201cOne of our models was found to have failed part of a fuel economy test.\u201d Further details are expected shortly.... Shares in Mitsubishi have tanked by 17%: Europe\u2019s main stock markets are all down this morning: Shares in ARM, the UK semiconductor maker, have jumped 2.6% after beating City expectations. ARM reported a 14% jump in profits this morning, as it continued to outperform despite concerns that demand for Apple\u2019s iPhone is falling. The London stock market has opened lower, with the FTSE 100 losing 26 points to 6377. Mining firms leading the fallers, with Anglo American shedding 2% and Glencore down 1.5%. They would suffer if China\u2019s central bank did crack down on credit, as Ma Jun hinted overnight. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets calls it a \u201cmild retreat\u201d from yesterday\u2019s first foray above 6400 points: Note renewed concern about China, with stocks sharply lower on suggestions the People\u2019s Bank of China has less stimulus appetite thanks to an improving outlook all the while worries grow about the country\u2019s mounting bad debts. The mood in China\u2019s stock markets has turned rather sour today. The main Shanghai share index has fallen by 3% in a worrying late selloff, with every sector losing ground. The selloff may have been triggered by one of China\u2019s top central bank economists, Ma Jun. He told the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s official newspaper that monetary policymakers will rein in excessive borrowing by companies and individuals. Or as he put it: \u201cAside from continuing to support steady economic growth, future monetary policy will focus on guarding against macroeconomic risks, especially avoiding rapid growth in companies\u2019 leverage, and will also consider the impact of increased loans on the cost of living and real estate prices.\u201d Reuters has more details: China may be more cautious with future policy easing - Financial News Chinese credit has exploded in recent years, helping avoid the economy slowing sharply. Any tightening could have a significant impact on growth The oil price is in retreat this morning after Kuwaiti workers ended a three day strike. Brent crude has slumped by 2.5% already, down over $1 to $42.95 per barrel, as traders anticipate more oil flowing from Kuwait again. Workers had walked out on Sunday, protesting against austerity cutbacks that will hit their wages and benefits. It\u2019s not clear what concessions they have been handed, though, in return for ending their display of labour power. Associated Press has the details: The state-run Kuwait News Agency reported that the unions ended the strike by praising the country\u2019s ruling emir, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, and saying their action showed their \u201cability to affect the production process.\u201d The unions \u201centrusted his highness, the emir, (with) the protection of rights of the employees in the oil sector,\u201d the unions said, according to KUNA. It said workers wouldn\u2019t be disciplined for taking part in the strike. Adel al-Fadhel, a spokesman for the Kuwait Oil Company Workers\u2019 Union, confirmed workers would go back to work Wednesday. He said Sheikh Sabah spoke to the head of one of the unions Tuesday by telephone to assure his support for the workers. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to announce that the strike has succeeded in preserving the rights of the workers in the oil sector,\u201d al-Fadhel told The Associated Press. \u201cHis highness, the emir, intervened and guaranteed to preserve the rights of the workers according to the law.\u201d Around half of Kuwait\u2019s usual oil production had been taken offline by the strike, which helped drive oil prices higher on Monday and Tuesday. Now, though, traders can return to worrying about supply gluts, and Opec\u2019s seeming inability to do anything about it..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. Coming up today..... At 9.30am, the latest UK unemployment figures are released. Economists expect the UK jobless claimant count to fall by another 10,000 people, while the unemployment rate remains at 5.1%. But today\u2019s report may also show that wage growth remains lacklustre. Average earnings growth (ex-bonuses) is tipped to slow to 2.1%, from 2.2% a month ago. There may be drama in Brussels this morning, if the European Commission hits Google with anti-competitive charges concerning its Android mobile phone operating system. Margrethe Vestager, European competition commissioner, is expected to make the announcement today: Closer to home, the bosses of the Port Talbot steel plant in South Wales may announce a buyout plan for the site. This could ask employees to invest up to \u00a310,000 each, to help take the plant off Tata UK\u2019s hands. After hitting four-month highs yesterday, European markets are expected to dip at the start of trading: And we\u2019re getting corporate results from (among others), UK chipmaker ARM, pub chain Punch Taverns and builders group Travis Perkins.",

                "body":"<p>The first ever British car was built in Coventry nearly 120 years ago. Now there are ambitious plans to re-establish the city as the heart of the country\u2019s recovering automotive industry. Carmakers, suppliers, universities, the local authority and the government have united in an attempt to turn Coventry into Britain\u2019s \u201cmotor city\u201d again, with hundreds of millions of pounds being invested.</p> <p>After the first British car was built by Daimler in 1897, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/coventry\">Coventry\u2019s</a> manufacturing industry grew until it reached a peak in the 1950s and 60s. At this stage, the UK was the second-biggest carmaker in the world and a host of the major companies were based in and or around Coventry, including the British Motor Corporation (maker of the Mini), Jaguar and Rootes Group, which later became part of Chrysler and then Peugeot. During this period, the average wage in Coventry was about 25% higher than the rest of the county.</p> <p>However, as the car industry fell into decline, so did Coventry, providing Britain with a similar story to the downfall of Detroit in the US, albeit on a smaller scale. In the late 1970s and early 1980s it is estimated that the top 15 employers in Coventry cut their combined workforce by almost half. Today, the only significant car production in Coventry is of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/20/black-cabs-not-unique-high-court-rules-green-taxis\">London\u2019s black cabs</a>, made by the Chinese-owned London Taxi Company. Jaguar closed its Browns Lane plant in 2005.</p> <p>However, Coventry has gradually emerged as a research and development (R&amp;D) hub, primarily thanks to the recovery of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/jaguar-land-rover\">Jaguar Land Rover</a> and Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), a research partnership between the University of Warwick and leading manufacturers in the city.</p> <p>Next year, the city\u2019s R&amp;D sector will be boosted with the opening of the <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/research/naic\">National Automotive Innovation Centre</a>. The \u00a3150m project, backed by JLR, WMG and the government, will become a base for advanced research, with academics and engineers working together. In addition, JLR has laid out expansion plans for the area worth almost \u00a3500m, which it says will make Coventry the \u201chearts and brains\u201d of the company.</p> <p> It will significantly expand R&amp;D operations at its headquarters at nearby Whitley and build new offices at a site called \u201cGateway North\u201d. Crucially, however, it is also understood to be planning a major new car factory, meaning mass production could return to Coventry for the first time in more than a decade.</p> <p>The man overseeing the rebirth of Britain\u2019s motor city is Lord Bhattacharyya, who founded WMG in 1980 and is an adviser to Tata, helping to broker its takeover of JLR in 2008. \u201cJLR is now next door, there are suppliers coming here, and there may be one or two other car companies who might be here,\u201d he explains. \u201cI want it to be very similar to Stuttgart, or Munich, or Michigan. Coventry city council is very cooperative in doing that, which is a central factor.</p> <p>\u201cThe combination of Coventry city council and us and say JLR \u2013 we can produce a motor city here. There are various things that JLR is thinking of doing here that I can\u2019t talk about, but they are expanding hugely. Already they have created nearly 5,000 jobs in Coventry over the last five years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6321e6b0c0d01e6c63102854196879fe4f2c75fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6321e6b0c0d01e6c63102854196879fe4f2c75fa/192_309_2970_1782/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers making a black cab inside the factory of the London Taxi Company factory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers making a black cab inside the factory of the London Taxi Company factory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bhattacharyya says such an industrial renaissance would require strong infrastructure, impressive R&amp;D facilities, and a wide collection of suppliers. \u201cYou don\u2019t put a motor city in the desert,\u201d he says. \u201cMotor city means you have facilities for the skill base, facilities for infrastructure, facilities for easy planning. There are all sorts of things you need.\u201d</p> <p>The optimism in Coventry is in stark contrast to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/22/tata-steel-welsh-billionaire-terry-matthews-port-talbot-buyout\">gloom surrounding the future of the steel industry</a> and Tata Steel\u2019s UK business, a far more challenging investment for the Indian company.</p> <p>Analysts believe the plans for Coventry are credible. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has forecast car production in the UK will clear 2 million a year by 2020, the highest level on record. <br></p> <p>David Bailey, professor of industry at Aston University, says: \u201cThere is an arc of research and development that goes from Horiba Mira [a research hub north of the city] into Coventry itself and then down to the motorsport industry and Silverstone. Probably about 90% of R&amp;D in the motor industry is in that space. It is a fantastic asset.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t do low-level assembly any more in the UK. We do design-intensive cars and we are going into low carbon. We are about to be able to make more cars than ever before, remarkably.\u201d</p> <p>However, Bailey says the UK needs to boost its car-parts sector in order to develop the automotive industry further. Just 40% of the parts on UK cars are from domestic sources, compared with 60% in Germany. \u201cWe need to do more on the supply chain,\u201d Bailey says.</p> <p>No matter how the plans for Coventry develop, WMG is already a world leader in its field. It was founded by Bhattacharyya, a Labour peer, in an attempt to breathe new life into British industry.</p> <p>Bhattacharyya was born in India but came to the UK to take up an apprenticeship with Lucas, which made parts for cars and planes, and was unimpressed by what he found.</p> <p>The concept of WMG was that the university would train graduates, with the companies paying for it and guiding the research. Today it has more than 600 staff, 4,000 students, and a research budget of \u00a3200m.

                "bodyText":"The first ever British car was built in Coventry nearly 120 years ago. Now there are ambitious plans to re-establish the city as the heart of the country\u2019s recovering automotive industry. Carmakers, suppliers, universities, the local authority and the government have united in an attempt to turn Coventry into Britain\u2019s \u201cmotor city\u201d again, with hundreds of millions of pounds being invested. After the first British car was built by Daimler in 1897, Coventry\u2019s manufacturing industry grew until it reached a peak in the 1950s and 60s. At this stage, the UK was the second-biggest carmaker in the world and a host of the major companies were based in and or around Coventry, including the British Motor Corporation (maker of the Mini), Jaguar and Rootes Group, which later became part of Chrysler and then Peugeot. During this period, the average wage in Coventry was about 25% higher than the rest of the county. However, as the car industry fell into decline, so did Coventry, providing Britain with a similar story to the downfall of Detroit in the US, albeit on a smaller scale. In the late 1970s and early 1980s it is estimated that the top 15 employers in Coventry cut their combined workforce by almost half. Today, the only significant car production in Coventry is of London\u2019s black cabs, made by the Chinese-owned London Taxi Company. Jaguar closed its Browns Lane plant in 2005. However, Coventry has gradually emerged as a research and development (R&amp;D) hub, primarily thanks to the recovery of Jaguar Land Rover and Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), a research partnership between the University of Warwick and leading manufacturers in the city. Next year, the city\u2019s R&amp;D sector will be boosted with the opening of the National Automotive Innovation Centre. The \u00a3150m project, backed by JLR, WMG and the government, will become a base for advanced research, with academics and engineers working together. In addition, JLR has laid out expansion plans for the area worth almost \u00a3500m, which it says will make Coventry the \u201chearts and brains\u201d of the company. It will significantly expand R&amp;D operations at its headquarters at nearby Whitley and build new offices at a site called \u201cGateway North\u201d. Crucially, however, it is also understood to be planning a major new car factory, meaning mass production could return to Coventry for the first time in more than a decade. The man overseeing the rebirth of Britain\u2019s motor city is Lord Bhattacharyya, who founded WMG in 1980 and is an adviser to Tata, helping to broker its takeover of JLR in 2008. \u201cJLR is now next door, there are suppliers coming here, and there may be one or two other car companies who might be here,\u201d he explains. \u201cI want it to be very similar to Stuttgart, or Munich, or Michigan. Coventry city council is very cooperative in doing that, which is a central factor. \u201cThe combination of Coventry city council and us and say JLR \u2013 we can produce a motor city here. There are various things that JLR is thinking of doing here that I can\u2019t talk about, but they are expanding hugely. Already they have created nearly 5,000 jobs in Coventry over the last five years.\u201d Bhattacharyya says such an industrial renaissance would require strong infrastructure, impressive R&amp;D facilities, and a wide collection of suppliers. \u201cYou don\u2019t put a motor city in the desert,\u201d he says. \u201cMotor city means you have facilities for the skill base, facilities for infrastructure, facilities for easy planning. There are all sorts of things you need.\u201d The optimism in Coventry is in stark contrast to the gloom surrounding the future of the steel industry and Tata Steel\u2019s UK business, a far more challenging investment for the Indian company. Analysts believe the plans for Coventry are credible. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has forecast car production in the UK will clear 2 million a year by 2020, the highest level on record. David Bailey, professor of industry at Aston University, says: \u201cThere is an arc of research and development that goes from Horiba Mira [a research hub north of the city] into Coventry itself and then down to the motorsport industry and Silverstone. Probably about 90% of R&amp;D in the motor industry is in that space. It is a fantastic asset. \u201cWe don\u2019t do low-level assembly any more in the UK. We do design-intensive cars and we are going into low carbon. We are about to be able to make more cars than ever before, remarkably.\u201d However, Bailey says the UK needs to boost its car-parts sector in order to develop the automotive industry further. Just 40% of the parts on UK cars are from domestic sources, compared with 60% in Germany. \u201cWe need to do more on the supply chain,\u201d Bailey says. No matter how the plans for Coventry develop, WMG is already a world leader in its field. It was founded by Bhattacharyya, a Labour peer, in an attempt to breathe new life into British industry. Bhattacharyya was born in India but came to the UK to take up an apprenticeship with Lucas, which made parts for cars and planes, and was unimpressed by what he found. The concept of WMG was that the university would train graduates, with the companies paying for it and guiding the research. Today it has more than 600 staff, 4,000 students, and a research budget of \u00a3200m. It has tie-ups with more than 1,000 companies, although JLR and Tata are its leading partners and conduct their advanced research at the site. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, visited WMG last month to open its new energy innovation centre, which Bhattacharyya believes can make Britain a world leader in the development of battery technology. \u201cNew products are accelerating in this area, whether it is electric cars, solid batteries, liquid cells. The speed of development is huge, absolutely huge,\u201d Bhattacharyya says. Leading companies are being attracted by WMG\u2019s work in battery technology and driverless cars. A major global technology company is in talks to start working with WMG, but Bhattacharyya will not reveal its identity. \u201cWe want to be able to develop very quickly an electric car which is for the ordinary public,\u201d he says. \u201cAll this business you see in the newspapers with Google and driverless cars. It will come in 50, 40, 30 years\u2019 time, but you need the infrastructure for it. So when people talk about low-emission cars, it\u2019s not just the battery, it\u2019s a combination of things \u2013 how you control the car, how you drive the car, how you make the car lighter. It\u2019s the totality of it that will give you whatever you want.\u201d",

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u2019s our editorial on the collapse of BHS, and the long run of mistakes and poor business practices that led to today\u2019s administration: The Guardian view on BHS: murder on the high street It concludes: As the government-run Pension Protection Fund prepares to rescue the BHS pensioners, the familiar mismatch between private profits and public losses is in evidence once again. eanwhile, hollowed-out husks could soon blight 100-plus high streets, yet another story of common space being disfigured after private greed enjoyed free reign. And a community used to being fleeced could be left with another nasty outbreak of British heist sores. And on that note, we\u2019re wrapping up until tomorrow... Goodnight, and thanks for the comments. GW The BHS crisis makes the front page of Tuesday\u2019s Guardian, and the news that its newish owners have taken \u00a325m out of the firm. Sarah Butler has looked into how the Green family have benefited from BHS over the years, and writes: When Sir Philip Green bought BHS in May 2000, he insisted it would not be rocket science to revive the ailing high street retailer. After paying \u00a3200m, he was convinced he had the skills to secure its future and make it the foundation of a sprawling retail empire. But last year, after failing in his mission, Green sold BHS for \u00a31 to a little known group of investors who have steered it into collapse in just over 12 months. His dreams for the chain may have come to nothing, but Green\u2019s family have still been big winners from BHS, taking out more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans to help fund a lavish lifestyle.... More here: Writing in the Guardian tonight, retail expert Mary Portas argues that BHS could have been saved from collapse with a bit more imagination. Here\u2019s a flavour: If I had been at British Home Stores I would have looked at today\u2019s market place and created a brand that is relevant for today\u2019s shopper. I would have gone totally after the value market, but made it functional and cool. I would have started with where it was good \u2013 the lighting. Then I would have extended that to become a modern British lifestyle retailer at a great price. Look at Tiger, which has come on to our high streets. It has done an extraordinary job of taking that basic fundamental market, that was the old Woolies, and made it sexy. Imagine if British Home Stores\u2019 ground floor was like Tiger, its fashion floor like Uniqlo or Primark and its home stuff like Ikea. Value with sex appeal all under one roof. Then add some small startups that are all young British makers or designers.... It\u2019s a balmy 16 degrees in Monaco tonight. But if Sir Philip Green is there, he may just have felt the chill of criticism from the House of Commons. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle put the former BHS owner firmly in the spotlight this afternoon, saying he faces \u201cserious questions\u201d. She basically accused Green of taking far more out of BHS (\u00a3422m) than he paid for it (\u00a3200m), before \u2018walking away\u2019 to his favourite tax haven. That will sting Green, who is sensitive to criticism over his ownership of BHS. But the toughest criticism actually came from Conservative MP Richard Fuller. He gave Green both barrels, saying he actually received \u201830 pieces of silver\u2019 for BHS, if he knowingly abandoned workers and pensioners to their fate. Fuller also channelled former PM Edward Heath, using the killer phrase \u2018the unacceptable face of capitalism\u2019 to describe those who renege on their pension liabilities. A rare experience, to be compared to both Tiny Rowland and Judas. MPs also remember the experience with Comet, where the taxpayer found itself on the hook for thousands of redundancy payments. They won\u2019t accept the Pension Protection Fund being stung this time, if it can be avoided. And if Anna Soubry had a secret rescue plan for BHS, she\u2019s keeping it to herself. The government view is that the retailer is a victim of changing shopping patterns and structural change - which is why finding a buyer has been so tough. Soubry kept repeating that BHS stores are open, but if a buyer isn\u2019t found soon, that won\u2019t last..... The final question goes to Martin Docherty-Hughes, SNP MP. The real scandal is that BHS workers face redundancies, and losing 10% of their pensions. Can the minister promise that all inquiries into BHS will be open and transparent, and that the \u2018full force of the law\u2019 will be used, if needed? Yes, Soubry replies. And that\u2019s the end of the session. Labour MP Diana Johnson warns parliament that BHS could be a repeat of the collapse of Comet. When Comet went into administration in 2012, there were 7,000 redundancies and the taxpayer paid up to \u00a3100m in redundancy costs. Comet had been owned by a private equity firm which bought the firm for a pound, loaded it with debt, and then walked away. The government should publish its report into Comet, so we can see if lessons can be learned. Anna Soubry promises to find out what happened to that report. Cardiff MP Jo Stephens asks whether the Insolvency Service has the resources to help BHS workers, given its budget is being cut. Soubry says she has full confidence in the insolvency service. Labour MP Gavin Shuker says the UK retail sector is dominated by low pay and lack of opportunity, and also dominated by women workers. Will the government do more to help regenerate the sector? Soubry says employers she has met are committed to helping their staff develop, but agrees that anything that helps female workers must be welcomed. SNP MP Roger Mullin says BHS workers are paying the price for Philip Green\u2019s failure, while he awaits for his new yacht. Why shouldn\u2019t Green be forced to pay the full \u00a3591m pension blackhole? Soubry says that it\u2019s important to do the right thing for workers who have paid into a pension their whole working life. Our market economy is dangerously undermined when the privatisation of vast profits isswiftly followed by the projections of similarly large losses onto other people, whether taxpayers or pensioners, says Conservative MP Steve Baker. Could the government look at the treatment of excessive debt, to avoid a repeat? Soubry says there are always lessons to be learned, but reiterates that BHS is still open and looking for a buyer. Q: Will Anna Soubry meet with the USDAW union to discuss how to save BHS jobs? I\u2019ll meet with pretty much anyone, Soubry replies. She\u2019s happy to meet USDAW, and try to persuade them to change their view on Sunday trading. Q: Does Soubry know whether the BHS trustees signed off the BHS \u00a31 last year. Were the Pension Protection Fund involved? And if not, could we close this loophole? Soubry says she doesn\u2019t know, but will write and find out.... Grimsby MP Melanie Onn says her constituency has lost Woolworths, Comet, Staples, Phones4U and now a WHSmiths store. She asks Soubry if she is concerned that BHS generated \u00a3100m through \u2018negative goodwill\u2019, which was then paid out in dividends rather than reinvested. Soubry replies that she actually recently shopped in Grimsby (eliciting an inaudible, but seemingly amusing, reply from Onn). Soubry replies that capitalism must have a caring heart. She agrees that Fuller is raising very serious issues, and we must see what conclusions the regulators come to. If there are any suggestions of impropriety, we will come after people, she adds. Richard Fuller, Conservative MP, says that the former owner of BHS [Philip Green] may have gone \u201claughing all the way to the bank\u201d when Retail Acquisitions offered to buy the group for \u00a31. But.... If that sale was done on the understanding that he was avoiding a responsibility for those pension losses, then \u00a31 was equivalent to 30 pieces of silver for that betrayal of the employees and pensioners. There is a reputational question here for Philip Green to answer, Fuller continues. The minister must write to him, and ask him to address these issues. And the government must assess the Pension Protection Fund, to avoid \u201cthis unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d of passing losses onto the taxpayer. SNP MP Alison Thewliss asks what the government is doing for workers at other companies why rely on BHS. Soubry says that we know that other companies in a supply chain suffer when one business fails. That\u2019s why we must stay positive and hope a buyer can be found. Conservative MP Peter Bottomley say he visited a BHS branch today and told workers that they have the full support of the House of Commons. Workers jobs and pensions must be a top priority, he adds. BHS has suffered from online sales, Soubry replies, and also from the fact people are less loyal to individual retailers these days. If you\u2019ve got BHS vouchers, go and spend them and support the staff, and the high street, she declares. Labour MP Ian Wright says it cannot be right for Philip Green to load BHS up with debt, fail to invest, pay his wife \u00a3400m in dividends, and live in a tax haven. Something is gravely wrong, he says. New legislation is needed to prevent owners making a fast buck. Soubry says that any allegations of impropriety must be taken very seriously. The SNP\u2019s Hannah Bardell says her party stand in solidarity with BHS workers at this time. She says there are some very serious allegations in the newpapers today, including the FT\u2019s article about the \u00a31bn \u2018siphoned out of BHS\u2019 The gap in BHS\u2019s pension fund merits serious investigation, she adds. Anna Soubry repeats that BHS stores are still open, and it\u2019s important not to talk the company into a deeper crisis. Conservative MP Mark Field says he is concerned that the Pension Protection Fund is being used as a bargaining chip, rather than in exceptional cases when a firm fails. Field says he shares the opposition\u2019s concern over the behaviour of the current and former BHS owners. Soubry agrees that the PPF should not be abused. Anna Soubry\u2019s statement on BHS is online here. Responding to Eagle, Soubry says her concern is for the workers at BHS, and its creditors. Eagle is turning this into a party political game, she claims. The Pensions Regulator is investigating the BHS pension blackhols now. And the insolvency service will take allegations of malpractice very seriously. Soubry also claims that the opposition would have more credibility if they hadn\u2019t voted against Sunday trading changes - which might have helped BHS. Philip Green has taken hundreds of millions out of BHS, and then walked away to his favourite tax haven leaving the pensions protection scheme to pick up the bill, Eagle continues. She cites the Guardian\u2019s revelation that BHS\u2019s new owner, Retail Acquisitions, has received more than \u00a325m in the last 13 months. She asks Anna Soubry to comment on Green\u2019s conduct as BHS\u2019s owner, and whether she agrees that owners should be forced to make a fair contribution Green has reportedly offered \u00a340m to the pensions black hole - is that acceptable? And will the government review the law to prevent irresponsible owners walking away and leaving others with the liabilities? Labour shadow minister Angela Eagle responds to Anna Soubry. 11,000 BHS staff will be very worried today. All MPs must hope that BHS can be sold as a going concern. But if the worst happens, the government must offer support to workers. Philip Green has some serious questions to answer, Eagle continues, having bought it for \u00a3200m, taken \u00a3422m of dividends, then sold it for \u00a31. He seems to have taken out far more from the business than he paid for it, she says. The pension fund had a \u00a3500 surplus when Green bought it, but this had become a deficit of hundreds of millions when he sold it, Eagle adds. Anna Soubry adds that there has been \u201csome speculation about the BHS pension scheme\u201d. She can\u2019t comment directly, but understands that the Pension Protection Fund is assessing the final funding position of the scheme, and who is responsible for its shortfall. Over in parliament, small business minister Anna Soubry is making a statement about BHS\u2019s collapse now. Soubry says that it is very difficult time for all the employees - up to 11,000 across the UK. It\u2019s also a difficult time for the company\u2019s creditors. The BHS name has been synonymous with British high streets for over 80 years, she continues, and still has a high street presence. She continues that the \u201cclear message\u201d is that BHS is still open for business. I understand that there are no plans for immediate redundancies or store closures, and that the administrators are looking to sell BHS as a going concern. If you\u2019ve been following the blog today, you\u2019ll already know that Damien has been interviewing shoppers about the decline and fall of BHS. Here\u2019s his full piece from Oxford Street: While we wait for the government\u2019s statement on BHS, here\u2019s a picture of Sir Philip Green\u2019s new superyacht: More details are emerging of payments made to Retail Acquisitions, which bought BHS in 2015 for \u00a31. Graham Ruddick and Sarah Butler report that more than \u00a325m was paid from BHS to its owner, Retail Acquisitions, in the 13 months between the department store\u2019s sale and it collapsing into administration. Sources with knowledge of BHS\u2019s finances say that the payments to Retail Acquisitions included \u00a32.8m in management fees, \u00a32.1m in salaries and wages, \u00a311m in legal and professional fees and \u00a310m in interest payments. Here\u2019s their full story: And if you are just joining us, here\u2019s the main news story on BHS collapsing into administration: Meanwhile, Simon Goodley has been looking into Dominic Chappell, the 49-year-old racing driver-turned-entrepreneur, who led the consortium that bought BHS from Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 last year. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 has closed down 0.8% or almost 50 points, at just shy of 6261. Miners and energy companies have pulled the wider index down as oil prices have slipped - Brent crude is down 0.7% at $44.8 per barrel. As we reported earlier, the news that BHS has collapsed into administration, did little to dent investor appetite for retailers\u2019 shares. Marks &amp; Spencer shares are up more than 1%, ASOS shares are up 0.9% and Boohoo is up 5.3%. But Debenhams shares are down 1% and Next is down 0.2%. Over on Wall Street it\u2019s been a subdued start to the week for US stocks. Hurt by weaker oil prices and jitters ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve decision on interest rates, the Dow Jones industrial average is down 0.6% at around 17,893 and the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.5% at 2,081. Earlier we heard from the head of shopworkers\u2019 union Usdaw, John Hannet, on how administrators will want to avoid repeating mistakes made after Woolworths\u2019 demise in 2008. Readers may remember that in 2012, 24,000 former staff of Woolworths were awarded compensation worth 60 days\u2019 pay because the stores had been closed without consultation after the chain collapsed. Nicholas Le Riche, employment partner at the law firm Bircham Dyson Bell says although BHS stores are still trading for now and a buyer for the company is being sought, \u201cit is likely that stores will be forced to close resulting in widespread redundancies.\u201d BHS will be expected to consult collectively with the Usdaw trade union and other relevant employee representatives, says Le Riche. He explains: The need to follow a fair process was illustrated by the collapse of Woolworths, which saw large claims over how the redundancy consultation had been conducted. On top of compensation for unfair dismissal, employees may also be entitled to up to 90 days\u2019 pay if there has been a failure in the collective consultation procedures. More commentary is coming in on how much, or how little, BHS\u2019s position is a function of the current retail climate. Gary Hobbs, senior equity analyst at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, says: \u201cWhilst conditions on the high street have been tough, as witnessed by the likes of Next, we suspect that the travails at BHS are as much a function of their financial position as they are a reflection of slower trading. \u201cWe do not envisage any material ramifications elsewhere for retailers, though there might be some work to do for the landlords of BHS\u2019 store portfolio.\u201d Some of BHS\u2019s retail rivals - with the notable exception of Next - seem to be faring well from its bad news on stock markets this afternoon. Connor Campbell, financial analyst spread betting company Spreadex comments: After teasing flatness at lunchtime the FTSE gave up the ghost as the day went on, reverting back to a 40 point loss as a dismal showing from its commodity stocks compounded the sense of unease that greeted BHS filing for administration. \u201cBHS\u2019 rivals have largely benefited from its collapse this Monday, be it online stores like ASOS and Boohoo (the latter seeing a 5% rise ahead of its preliminary results tomorrow), or similarly recognisable high street staples like Marks &amp; Spencer and Sports Direct. Interestingly Next bucked this trend, falling nearly 1.5% as the company\u2019s investors wondered if they were looking at the Ghost of High Street Future.\u201d Shares in Next are down around 1.2%, ASOS shares are up 0.5%, Boohoo is up 4.7%, Sports Direct is up 0.6% and Marks &amp; Spencer shares are up 0.8%. Back on Oxford Street, Damien Gayle, has been sounding out more shoppers on what went wrong at BHS. \u201cWhat\u2019s BHS - is that a sandwich?\u201d asked Jason Knight, 21, as he and his friends drank coffee outside Starbucks. He appeared to only be half joking. But his friend Amy West (pictured), 23, was at least aware of the retail chain\u2019s existence. Had she ever shopped there? \u201cI have, when I was a kid though, my nan used to take me there. Me and my nan used to pop into the shopping centre and she used to say: \u2018I just have to go into BHS\u2019.\u201d If you are just joining us, here\u2019s our latest news story on BHS collapsing into administration after failing to agree a last-minute deal to rescue the department store chain. Amid the the biggest failure on the high street since that of Woolworths in 2008, there are fears for the jobs of the BHS\u2019s 11,000 employees. The government is expected to make a statement on the failure of the 88-year-old retail group in parliament later this afternoon - probably around 5pm. On financial markets, it\u2019s been a lacklustre day for the FTSE 100 share index. The bluechips index is currently down around 44 points, or 0.7%, 6267. This week marks one year since the index hit its record closing leavel of 7,103. The FTSE is now down almost 12% from that high point. But Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown has been taking a closer look and notes that behind the headline drop in the index, a high proportion of UK companies and funds have prospered over the last year. One third of FTSE 100 companies have seen a share price rise since the index peaked and 36% of UK funds have made a positive return since the peak. Khalaf comments: Last April the market was riding high with the Footsie breaking new ground for the first time since 1999. Twelve months on, and the UK\u2019s headline index has had a reality check, losing a fifth of its value from peak to trough, as commodity and banking stocks plummeted. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get carried away with the twists and turns of the FTSE 100, but it\u2019s important to bear in mind the headline index is heavily influenced by the performance of the largest stocks, so doesn\u2019t give the full picture of how UK plc is doing. \u201cOne third of the stocks in the Footsie have risen over the last year, though they haven\u2019t been able to outweigh the black hole left by big oil, big mining, and big finance.\u201d Damien Gayle has been speaking to more shoppers on and around Oxford Street this afternoon and getting more of a sense of how UK consumers have fallen out of love with BHS. Hayden Clottey, 23, was browsing the boutiques of Carnaby Street, close to the BHS flagship store. Asked why he wasn\u2019t shopping in BHS, he said: I\u2019ve shopped there before. I used to have a friend who worked there. It\u2019s alright, you can get pretty much everything there. It\u2019s always a safe bet when you have to get presents for people - just the little packages of soap and things like that. I wouldn\u2019t selectively go in there I suppose.\u201d Jasmin Steiner, 20, and Holly Hicks Holcroft, 18, were also browsing Carnaby Street\u2019s boutiques. Asked how they felt about BHS\u2019s financial troubles, Hicks Holcroft replied: It doesn\u2019t really bother me - it\u2019s no Woolworths. Bring on change. \u201c I can remember going there with my nan. It was that sort of shop that you go to with your nan and your parents. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame I guess but it\u2019s making room for more stuff.\u201d Steiner said they had been out shopping at Monkey, a nearby boutique. We look at everything that\u2019s really expensive and then go to buy it in Primark,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve never bought anything from there [BHS]. Maybe we will go and look when everything\u2019s on sale, get my nan\u2019s Christmas presents for the next five years.\u201d Our financial editor Nils Pratley has some stern words of advice for Dominic Chappell, boss of BHS owner Retail Acquisitions, and he has some tough questions about the \u00a3571m deficit in the pension fund and the onus on previous BHS owner Sir Philip Green to sort out the mess. Nils notes how Chappell is \u201ccrassly missing the required tone\u201d when he writes in an email to staff: \u201cI would like to say it has been a real pleasure working with all of you on the BHS project, one I will never forget.\u201d \u201cNo, Mr Chappell, BHS was never a \u201cproject\u201d for the staff. It is how they earned their living and made plans to fund their retirement,\u201d writes Nils. On the pension problems, he continues: Given the odds against the BHS \u201cproject\u201d succeeding \u2013 there is an urgent question. How much responsibility for the \u00a3571m deficit in the pension fund lies with Sir Philip Green, who sold BHS to Chappell and his inexperienced crew for \u00a31 a year ago. The answer is clearly not none. The principle is clear: former owners cannot wash their hands of a pensions problem simply by selling a business for a token sum... Prepare to dig deep, Sir Philip: forget Topshop, the yachts (a new 300-footer is on the way), the fashion academy and the knighthood. Your contribution to retailing will be remembered chiefly by the decency, or otherwise, of your behaviour towards BHS pensioners. Read the full column here: Usdaw - the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers - has put out a statement calling for urgent talks with BHS. General secretary John Hannett has also drawn parallels with Woolworths as he urges the administrators to include workers in their decisions. Hannett says in a statement: \u201cThis is devastating news for the employees of BHS and we urge the company to change their attitude to trade unions and begin a dialogue with us at this difficult and worrying time. \u201cWe also urge the administrators and the company to comply with the law, consult with staff and Usdaw as the union for BHS workers. We don\u2019t want to see BHS staff locked out of discussions, sent to the back of the queue of creditors and treated like fixtures and fittings, as happened at Woolworths.\u201d \u201cThe Government needs to intervene now to protect taxpayers from picking up the bill for redundancy payments and safeguard the Pension Protection Fund. \u201cWe are in touch with our members working in BHS to reassure them that we will provide the support, advice and representation they require.\u201d Moving away from developments at BHS for a moment, jobs are also under threat at oil company Royal Dutch Shell. Shell is closing three UK offices, affecting 1,600 employees, including BG\u2019s headquarters in Reading, after its \u00a335bn takeover of the oil and gas company earlier this year, my colleague Nick Fletcher reports. The company has also begun a voluntary redundancy programme as part of a plan to cut 10,300 jobs across the merged group, comprising 7,500 from the original Shell business, as it attempts to cope with the recent plunge in oil prices, and another 2,800 following the merger with BG. The Reading office will close by the end of the year and the 800 staff based there will be offered the chance to move to Shell\u2019s central London base, which will house the entirety of the company\u2019s south-east England operations. Here\u2019s Nick\u2019s full story: The time of that statement to parliament has shifted again, now to the slightly earlier time of 5pm Time for a quick recap. Britain is facing its biggest retail failure since Woolworths collapsed in 2008. BHS, which employs 11,000 people, is now in the hands of administrators from Duff &amp; Phelps. They have promised to keep stores open, as they seek to sell the company as a going concern. Many analysts have warned that stores are likely to shut, with the best possibly \u2018cherry-picked\u2019 by rival retailers. Shoppers have told us of their sadness over BHS\u2019s demise. One lady warned that older shoppers will be disadvantaged if the brand vanishes from the high street. Younger consumers, though, say the company simply failed to move with the times. Business minister Anna Soubry is expected to give a statement to parliament about BHS this afternoon. It could be at 5.30pm Former owner, the retail chief Sir Philip Green, is also in the spotlight. The FT has highlighted how he took large dividends out of the company, before eventually selling it for \u00a31 last year. The Pensions Regulator has reportedly opened an investigation into BHS\u2019s pension scheme. It is currently facing a \u00a3571m black hole; Green could potentially be asked to cover some of this. The collapse of BHS is a personal blow to Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell: Our colleague Amelia Gentleman would like to hear from BHS staff: Sir Philip Green\u2019s 15-year ownership of BHS is in the spotlight today. The Financial Times\u2019s Alphaville site have published a handy explanation of how the Green family did rather well out of the retailer. FT: Would 11,000 BHS workers still have jobs if Tina Green hadn\u2019t siphoned \u00a31bn out of the business? Here\u2019s a flavour: Here, in very rough terms, is how the finances worked. It\u2019s an open question as to whether, with a little less financial engineering, this business might yet have survived. Green, a short man with a famous temper, acquired BHS (on behalf of his wife) for a pittance back in 2000. The store chain was in dire shape, but was conceivably worth more than he had paid. So Green booked circa \u00a3100m of \u2018negative\u2019 goodwill through the P&amp;L, declaring BHS to be surprisingly profitable. Magic. The parent company was then loaded with debt and the bulk of the cash was sent, via dividends, to Tina in Monaco. Precious little went into BHS, which continued to struggle.... Eventually, Green sold the group for \u00a31. But he\u2019d also built a retail empire with Top Shop, of course, helping to fund those super-yachts..... Then again.... Update: business minister Anna Soubry will speak to parliament about the BHS crisis, at around 4.30pm.... BHS vouchers can still be used to part-purchase goods, reports Sky News\u2019s Dharshini David: We mentioned earlier that Which? have urged people to spend gift vouchers immediately, they are treated as unsecured creditors once a firm enters administration. This is obviously hugely frustrating for people who have received vouchers - particularly if a retailer goes belly-up just after Christmas. Insolvency trade body R3 explains why it\u2019s a tough decision for administrators: Accepting vouchers could: Hurt other creditors by reducing the value of assets available for other creditors (by reducing stock); Deter potential buyers who may not wish to take on the obligation to honour vouchers; Reduce the value of an offer for the retailer given the size of the potential liability. But not accepting vouchers could: Damage the relationship between the business and its customers; Damage confidence in the business among potential investors. The government is expected to make a statement on BHS\u2019s fall into administration in the next few hours. It will either come from business secretary Sajid Javid, or small business minister Anna Soubry: BHS staff look downbeat as they walk in and out of the company\u2019s HQ this lunchtime. Those approached by the Guardian refused to comment on the firm\u2019s financial situation, as the administrators take control of the firm. Meanwhile, TV cameras stood trained on the sliding doors and journalists clutching notepads shuffled to keep warm. BREAKING: BHS has officially fallen into administration, and is now under the control of Duff &amp; Phelps. Here\u2019s the official statement, which confirms they will keep BHS stores open while they try to sell the group as a \u2018going concern\u2019. Philip Duffy and Benjamin Wiles, Managing Directors at Duff &amp; Phelps have today been appointed Joint Administrators of BHS (The Group). The Group has been undergoing restructuring and, as has been widely reported, the shareholders have been in negotiations to find a buyer for the business. These negotiations have been unsuccessful. In addition property sales have not materialised as expected in both number and value. Consequently, as a result of a lower than expected cash balance, the Group is very unlikely to meet all contractual payments. The Directors therefore have no alternative but to put the Group into administration to protect it for all creditors. The Group will continue to trade as usual whilst the Administrators seek to sell it as a going concern. Further announcements will be made as appropriate in due course. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our updated news story on the BHS crisis: BHS is going into administration after failing to agree a last-minute deal to rescue the department store chain. The collapse of the retailer, which employs 11,000 people, will be the biggest failure on the high street since the demise of Woolworths in 2008. Staff have been told this morning that BHS has called in Duff &amp; Phelps as administrators and should formally enter insolvency procedure today. The formal administration will begin when it is approved by the high court, a statement from Duff &amp; Phelps is expected shortly. The collapse of the 88 year old BHS presents another problem for government as it attempts to save thousands of jobs in the steel industry. BHS has failed to secure emergency funding that it needed to pay wages and its rent.... Full story here: Sajid Javid, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills, has tweeted that the government is doing its bit: Javid has a lot on his plate - he\u2019s already trying to avoid the loss of 4,000 jobs in the steel industry. Having bought BHS for just \u00a31 last year, will Retail Acquisitions end up in profit despite administration? Pension regulators could force former owner Sir Philip Green to help cover the BHS pensions black hole. Last month, the Mail on Sunday reported that they\u2019re considering asking Sir Philip for at least \u00a3300m to cover the \u00a3571m pension black hole. As Nick Hood pointed out this morning, business owners can\u2019t just sell up and abandon pensioners. And after taking an estimated \u00a3400m dividends out of BHS, Green is in the spotlight. Especially as he\u2019s taking delivery of a new \u00a3100m superyacht - his third! Dubbed Lionheart (the yacht, not Sir Philip), it will apparently be as long as a football pitch, and four storeys high, with all the swimming pools and jacuzzis one could ever need. Dr Gordon Fletcher of the University of Salford says BHS has failed to keep up with retail trends, or lose its image as a Baby Boomers store. The utilitarian model of retailing everything within one physical store simply does not appeal to younger generations and along with the soaring cost of servicing pensions the fate of this stalwart appears sealed. Being cheap, but not cheap enough to compete, coupled with being a landmark brand while not offering anything distinctive produces that particularly bland region of retailing that BHS has increasingly occupied. Mrs Condon from Camden has emerged from BHS\u2019s Oxford Street store carrying bulging bags. And like Louise Simpson, she\u2019s bought some cushions - apparently a BHS staple. Mrs Condon tells us that the failure of BHS was tragic: \u201cI love that store. We don\u2019t go down here very often, but I\u2019ve always loved BHS. It\u2019s got a variety of things, whatever you need it\u2019s there for you.\u201d Asked what she had bought, Condon, who gave her age as in her 70s, replied: \u201cI wanted some cushions, some bath towels, sheets and bits and bobs you don\u2019t need to know about.\u201d Back on Oxford Street, Louise Simpson, 40, from Wakefield is passing time with her dad, Bill Hardy, while her daughter had an interview for a place at Rada, the nearby performing arts college. She emerged from BHS with shopping bags bulging with new living room cushions. Asked about the business going bust, she tells Damien Gayle that: \u201cI think it\u2019s quite a sad day to be honest.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure of the reasons for the business failing, but Bill, 69, cut in with \u201clack of customers.\u201d He explains: \u201cWhen you go in there there\u2019s not many people walking around buying stuff. Back to the old saying: people haven\u2019t got the money.\u201d Louise adds: \u201cTo be honest it\u2019s internet shopping for me. It\u2019s age. Parents will probably just keep shopping around but we will just Google it. I think the Internet has got a lot to say for a lot of shops (which are closing down). Probably won\u2019t be the last either.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to put a bet on which one will be next,\u201d Bill added. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame to think that they are going under considering how long they have been going.\u201d Meanwhile, the Oxford Street store seemed to be attracting plenty of interest. Plenty of shoppers went through its swing doors. Few however emerged with any purchases. Jon Copestake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says BHS\u2019s current owners have not performed well: Having purchased the retail chain for just \u00a31 [in March 2015], Retail Acquisitions has shown little appetite or acumen for retail management, despite its name. Its owner Dominic Chappelle is a former racing driver with more experience of bankruptcy than retail. In addition to his hefty salary he has been involved in a number of questionable transactions, such as reportedly diverting funds borrowed by BHS to its directors while pushing landlords to accept rent reductions. On the retail side a successful repositioning of the brand and product portfolio has not materialised and much of the company\u2019s recent strategy has centred on selling off prime properties to keep creditors at bay. Guardian Witness would like to hear from BHS staff, and from former workers worries about their pension: Retail commentator Paul Mitchell sees more trouble ahead: A 66-year-old woman from St. John\u2019s Wood, who declined to give her name, said she always gets her clothes from BHS. \u201cI\u2019m so upset!\u201d She exclaimed when Damien asked about the shops financial troubles. \u201cThe prices are reasonable and I just like it. Marks and Spencer are too upmarket now, all it is is business suits and business blouses and they are totally out of touch with people like me. \u201cI\u2019ve just bought a swimming costume the other week. It\u2019s \u00a328 in here and \u00a335 in Marks, and I got 25% off so it came down to about \u00a310 difference. It\u2019s things like that. Maybe you could say BHS are probably for my age group but there\u2019s some nice stuff for the younger generation as well.\u201d Today, she said, she was going in to buy sandals for a forthcoming holiday. And she agreed that BHS\u2019s demise would be the end of a British institution. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real, real shame because to me John Lewis and Debenhams are too expensive now. Primark\u2019s quality is not that great, plus they are more for the younger generation. There\u2019s not many shops now that cater for the older woman.\u201d BHS\u2019s owner has confirmed that the administrators have arrived, reports Ben Martin of the Telegraph: The press are gathering on Oxford Street.... This is why BHS has struggled to find new funding: Andri Antoniades, 59, from Cyprus, and her husband are browsing the Oxford Street shops during a holiday to London. They already know about BHS\u2019s problems. And speaking to Damien Gayle, they raised the topic of Philip Green\u2019s \u00a31.2bn dividend [from his Arcadia empire in 2005] and his subsequent sale of the business for \u00a31 last year. Andri said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good and this is what happens at the end of the day. He brought in a famous model [Caprice] he was trying to upmarket the look, but obviously it\u2019s gone a bit wrong.\u201d The Antoniades didn\u2019t plan to buy anything from BHS, just take a look. Her husband broke in with a smile: \u201cWe\u2019ve just come to see it before it collapsed!\u201d Andri added: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be able to say I was there...\u201d Nicolette Kadzeya, 39, was waiting with her three children outside BHS\u2019s store on Oxford Street when it opened. She believes the company has failed to keep pace with the changing times, my colleague Damien Gayle reports: Kadzeya had read about the firms\u2019s problems but hoped it would open because she had to exchange an unwanted item \u201cI think the problem with BHS is that this branch is very up to date but if you go to the branch in Surrey Quays it\u2019s as if you have gone back in time. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve gone back to the mid-90s. \u201cSome of the branches which are outside of London are not that well maintained. It\u2019s a bit old fashioned as well. They are good for school shoes but it\u2019s not really up to date.\u201d She couldn\u2019t talk for long though.... \u201cI think they are open so I have to make it fast,\u201d Kadzeya said as she wheeled her buggy inside. BHS\u2019s store in Oxford Street doesn\u2019t look terribly busy, but at least it\u2019s open for business this morning: A BHS spokesperson has confirmed that the administration process is underway: BHS\u2019s social media team are doing their best to remain upbeat today, and ready to help: Customers are showing their support too: We\u2019re expecting BHS to file for administration as soon as the UK courts are open for business: Newsflash: German business confidence is weaker than expected, according to the latest survey from the IFO thinktank. IFO\u2019s business confidence reading has dipped to 106.6, from 106.7 last month, with firms reporting that conditions have become tougher. Anyone holding BHS gift vouchers should spend them right now, says Alex Neill, head of campaigns at consumer group Which. She points out that administrators are not obliged to accept gift vouchers - even though the company has already received the monay for them. Which explains: When a company goes into administration the administrators get certain powers to help turn the company around. These powers enable them to refuse to accept vouchers if they consider this is in the best interests of the company. Keep an eye on the administration progresses as the administrators may initially decide not to take vouchers and then later decide they will. The crisis at BHS highlights wider problems in the retail sector , argues Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital. It\u2019s not just BHS that\u2019s suffering - shares are down sector-wide over the last 12 months \u2013 reflecting investor caution about an industry that\u2019s increasingly dependent on cheap credit and little else to drive it. The concern is that if interest rates rise \u2013 which they will have to do sooner or later - consumers will quickly tighten their belts and dispense with their credit cards. Meanwhile, retailers\u2019 margins are being squeezed by the new living wage, which is driving up wage costs when there is little sign of meaningful sales price growth. BHS may have been another Woolworths that struggled to adapt to the new retail world. But the same pressures that squeezed the life out of BHS are being felt across the UK retail sector today. Trouble on the high street is usually a sign of more deep-seated problems in the UK\u2019s economy.\u201d Austin Reed, another high street name, went into administration last week too, despite the patronage of IMF chief Christine Lagarde.... BHS staff are due to learn at 11am that their jobs are at \u201cvery high risk\u201d after efforts to create a rescue deal over the weekend failed, says the BBS\u2019s Simon Jack. Administrators Duff &amp; Phelps are lined up to take control, and will try to sell BHS as a going concern. That will be tough, though, as the company needs \u00a3100m of fresh funding. BHS is paying the price for not keeping track with its customers\u2019 changing needs, says Phil Dorrell, Partner, Retail Remedy retail consultants. Dorrell agrees that the company\u2019s better stores will be \u2018cherry-picked\u2019: When the administrators are called in, there won\u2019t be a retailer to buy BHS wholesale. Expect a piecemeal sale of specific sites in strategic locations to John Lewis possibly or Sports Direct or Next. Sadly this is probably the beginning of the end for BHS on our High Streets. It would take a brave and innovative business to buy the brand and turn it into an ongoing concern. BHS can trace its history back to 1928, when it was created as a British rival to Woolworths. It floated five years later, spending 65 years on the stock market until retail magnate Philip Green took it over in 2000. Our BHS timeline has the details: Nick Hood adds that BHS\u2019s profitable stores will probably cherry-picked, perhaps by Sports Direct. That would save some jobs, but as he tells the Today Programme: Ultimately, we\u2019ve got 11,000 jobs at risk here and the pensions of 20,000 people. It\u2019s a disaster. The pension fund currently faces a \u00a3576m deficit, but that would \u2018escalate\u2019 if BHS fails and the deficit is \u201ccrystallised\u201d. Q: Could they go after Philip Green, the former owner of BHS, who sold BHS for a pound last year? Pension liabilities are like Hotel California, Hood says, you can check out but never leave. The Pension Protection Fund will be looking very closely, and could issue a contribution notice to people who have been connected with the fund, Hood adds. The initial offer I believe Sir Philip made of \u00a340m, plus a \u00a340m loan on top, won\u2019t cut the mustard. Inevitably, a much higher contribution will be required. BHS\u2019s options are \u201cdistinctly limited\u201d as it totters on the brink of administration, warns Nick Hood, business risk adviser at the insolvency practitioners Opus. Speaking on the Today Programe, Hood says BHS has suffered from years of serious underinvestment, and lost over \u00a3400m over the last six years. Retail these days is all about heavy investment in staying up with the trend, online offerings, mobile offerings. None of this has happened at BHS. This has awful exchoes of what you and I were discussing in 2008 over the demise of Woolworths. Another retail business that hasn\u2019t stayed up with the times. One of Britain\u2019s longest-running retail chains is on the brink of collapse. It\u2019s almost 90 years since British Home Stores was founded. And BHS could fall into administration this morning, as hopes of a last-minute deal with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct fade. With 11,000 jobs at risk, plus the pensions of tens of thousands of former workers, it could be the biggest retail failure since Woolworths eight years My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: BHS has failed to secure emergency funding that it needed to pay wages and its rent. The restructuring firm Duff &amp; Phelps is set to be appointed as administrators on Monday, unless \u00a360m can be found to keep BHS afloat in the short term. Darren Topp, the chief executive of BHS, said: \u201cWhat was on the table wasn\u2019t sufficient and we have been working in the last few days to fill the gap.\u201d The pound has hit its highest level since early March this morning, after President Barack Obama made his dramatic intervention into the EU referendum debate. Sterling jumped by more than half a cent in early trading against the US dollar, hitting $1.4475 for the first time in five weeks. Obama\u2019s warnings against Brexit have enraged the \u201cOut campaign\u201d, but traders are calculating that they could sway undecided voters ahead of the June 23 referendum. On Friday night, the US president insisted that Britain would be at the \u201cback of the queue\u201d to arrange a trade deal with America. Later he said it could take a decade - comments reiterated by Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Economists expect the pound to slump if the public do vote to leave the EU, so today\u2019s move suggests the Remain camp are on the front foot. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The pound was among one of the best performing currencies last week and has continued to rally this morning against the US dollar and euro as markets perceive that the recent intervention by US President Obama, as well as his possible successor Hillary Clinton has shifted the odds towards the \u201cStay \u201c camp in the latest polling indicators, dealing a blow to \u201cBrexit\u201d campaigners. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Traders are bracing for a busy week, with new growth data from Britain (on Wednesday), the US (Thursday) and the eurozone (on Friday). Both the eurozone and the UK are expected to have grown by just 0.4% during the first quarter of 2016, due to domestic weaknesses and the slowdown in emerging markets. And America might do even worse, with quarterly growth of just 0.15% expected. This morning, new German business confidence figure are released at 9am BST, by the IFO thinktank. It\u2019s expected to show a small improvement in business expectations, from 106.7 to 107.1. Then we get a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s industrial sector at 11am, from the CBI. Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to open mixed, after falling around 1% on Friday",
