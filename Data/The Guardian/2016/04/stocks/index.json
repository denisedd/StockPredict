First, continue on the same muddling-through path with the IMF in an advisory role. Obviously, the Fund has to compromise its positions. Second, the European lenders show the IMF the exit and assume the responsibility for the Greek program, sticking to the targets, accepting a milder austerity package and providing a politically acceptable version of debt relief. However, this may face political resistance in Germany and other countries. Third, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Stability Mechanism accept the IMF\u2019s action plan. In this case, the primary surplus target should be lowered and generous debt relief should be provided.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, the three stakeholders in the Greek program have different political incentives. This makes a reasonable solution more difficult to reach. On the three possible ways forward outlined above, it seems the muddling-through approach would be the least productive but politics could continue to make it the dominant one. The remaining two approaches would face bigger political hurdles but could work better for all parties involved.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-570262d4e4b0d29fa4d0c694\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-04T12:52:43.858Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>After a slow start, European markets are edging higher.</strong></p> <p>The FTSE 100 is up 0.3% while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.66% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.63%.</p> <p>Meanwhile US futures are showing the Dow Jones Industrial Average virtually unchanged, up around 8 points.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-04T12:52:59.086Z\">at 1.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5702571de4b0d29fa4d0c67d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-04T12:09:51.819Z\">1.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Worries about the Greek bailout after the weekend\u2019s reported IMF threat have sent Greek bond yields higher.</strong></p> <p>The two year yields climbed to a one month high of 11.15% while 10 year yields rose 26 basis points to 8.99%.

The U.K. had joined the European community only two years earlier. But today, given the U.K.\u2019s deep political, financial and trading ties in Europe, an exit would be much more fraught \u2014 and the risks, when it comes to its credit worthiness, are therefore considerably higher.</p> <p>While Brexit supporters share a collective skepticism about the \u201cEuropean experiment,\u201d they lack consensus on what Britain\u2019s trading options and political alliances will look like outside of the EU. If the Brexit camp wins the vote on June 23, the U.K. would enter a protracted period of uncertainty while its people debate the alternative. Markets dislike uncertainty \u2014 especially protracted uncertainty \u2014 and this \u201cworking out\u201d period will likely have adverse credit consequences for the U.K...</p> <p>Brexit would further polarize the U.K.\u2019s political system, increase risks to effective, transparent and predictable policymaking, and diminish the U.K.\u2019s long-term sovereign creditworthiness. Brexit also heightens potential risks to economic growth and the balance of payments, as well as domestic political threats to territorial integrity.</p> <p>Consequently, a vote for \u201cLeave\u201d would likely lead Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s to lower the U.K.\u2019s AAA rating \u2014 a rating it has held, without interruption, since 1978. While the U.K.\u2019s rating would likely remain high given its many institutional, financial and economic strengths, the U.K. would lose its place in the increasingly exclusive club of AAA-rated sovereigns.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-04T10:28:36.008Z\">at 11.28am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5702358ae4b0f2216ccb286f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-04T09:38:14.975Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The falls in the eurozone unemployment rate could slow down in the coming months, says Bert Colijn at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While dark clouds packed over the Eurozone economy in the beginning of the year, the labour market has continued to provide tailwind. The improvements in unemployment continue to fuel domestic demand in times when consumers have become more cautious. This will likely mitigate the negative effects of people more concerned about the state of the global economy.The improvements are not evenly spread across the Eurozone though. France and Italy saw the number of unemployed increase in February, although in France this did not lead to a higher unemployment rate. Germany and Spain saw unemployment decline again, with the unemployment rate in Spain falling from 20.5% to 20.4%. The continued struggle to reduce unemployment in France and Italy will likely have a dampening effect on domestic demand in the coming months.</p> <p>While the labour market continues to improve, unemployment is known to be a lagging indicator. Surveys have recently indicated that employers are currently cautious to see how the market turmoil of the beginning of the year is playing out, which could result in more subdued hiring in the months ahead. The momentum of hiring is also not as strong as it was a few months back. The 3-month decline in unemployment has fallen from over half a million in September, to 224 thousand in February. With employers being cautious, this could mean that the relatively high pace of declines in the Eurozone unemployment rate over the past year could be slowing down somewhat in the months ahead. With the unemployment rate still well above its natural rate, that is bad news for price pressures.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5702332ce4b0d29fa4d0c60c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-04T09:34:52.373Z\">10.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone unemployment and producer prices fall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More data from the eurozone, with unemployment falling for a thirteenth successive month and producer prices dropping by more than expected in February.</p> <p>The unemployment rate fell from 10.4% to 10.3% but the jobless decline of 39,000 was the smallest drop since last May.</p> <p>Producer prices fell by 0.7% month on month compared to forecasts of a 0.5% decline.</p> <p>Meanwhile Peter Praet, chief economist at the European Central Bank, said it was prepared to ease monetary policy further if inflation remained stubbornly low.

Latest hard data show that construction output disappointingly dipped 0.2% month-on-month and 0.8% in January, marking a soft start to 2016.</p> <p>The government will be particularly disappointed to see housebuilding growth almost ground to a halt in March when it was at its weakest level since January 2013 - given that it is looking to address the UK\u2019s acute housing shortage.</p> <p>With the corresponding manufacturing survey also weak for March, first quarter GDP growth again looks to have been heavily dependent on the services sector \u2013 so much attention will be focused on the purchasing managers survey for the services sector for March that comes out on Tuesday, especially as the February survey was at a near three-year low.</p> <p>Furthermore, there is not much in the survey to indicate that the construction sector\u2019s fortunes are going to pick up in the near term as it shows orders growth at an 11-,month low, business expectations stuck at the lowest level since December 2014 and employment growth at the lowest level since mid-2013.</p> <p>The construction sector is seemingly currently being affected by increased caution among clients (especially for major projects) amid heightened UK and global economic uncertainties \u2013 and it notable that the purchasing managers indicated that clients are \u201cunwilling to commit to new contracts or expand existing work\u201d.</p> <p>The looming 23 June referendum on UK membership of the EU adds to the uncertainties dogging the construction sector \u2013 especially given the tightness of opinion polls.</p> <p>On a relatively encouraging note, the purchasing managers reported that \u201csurvey respondents cited a generally supportive economic backdrop\u201d</p> <p>Also on the positive side, there is increasing government support for housebuilding (which needs to see prolonged decent expansion to make genuine inroads into the UK\u2019s acute housing shortage). In November\u2019s Autumn Statement, the Chancellor announced plans to double the housing budget to over \u00a32 billion a year and to build 400,000 new affordable homes by the end of the decade. Additionally, the government has announced measures aimed at speeding up the planning system and reducing the obstacles to building new houses.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-04T09:25:18.157Z\">at 10.25am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57022c2ae4b0d29fa4d0c5fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-04T08:57:14.488Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Eurozone investor confidence has risen but by less than expected. </strong>The Sentix index came in at 5.7, up from 5.5 but below the forecast of 6.9.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57021e69e4b0fde262ff626f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-04T08:54:53.731Z\">9.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Even without the weekend\u2019s leaks about Greece, the talks with its lenders would have been difficult enough anyway:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NickMalkoutzis/status/716894981873659904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> &amp; its lenders will have a whole list of unresolved issues in front of them when they resume talks today <a href=\"https://t.co/BlG9EhCcJ1\">https://t.co/BlG9EhCcJ1</a></p>&mdash; Nick Malkoutzis (@NickMalkoutzis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickMalkoutzis/status/716894981873659904\">April 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57022ad1e4b0d29fa4d0c5f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-04T08:53:28.383Z\">9.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Telecom shares have been hit by Friday\u2019s news of the collapse of a \u20ac10bn deal between Orange and Bouygues to create a dominate French operator.

                "bodyText":"Despite earlier hopes that the US market would move higher at the open, it has slipped back in early trading. Investors appear to be unsettled by another move lower in the oil price, with Brent crude currently down 0.8% at $38.34 a barrel on concerns that a meeting this month between producers would be unable to agree a freeze in output. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 24 points or 0.14%, which has seen European markets come off their best levels. The FTSE 100 is now up 0.2%, Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac are both 0.4% better. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Three possible solutions to the Greek situation are examined by newspaper Kathimerini: Under the circumstances, there are three possible ways forward. First, continue on the same muddling-through path with the IMF in an advisory role. Obviously, the Fund has to compromise its positions. Second, the European lenders show the IMF the exit and assume the responsibility for the Greek program, sticking to the targets, accepting a milder austerity package and providing a politically acceptable version of debt relief. However, this may face political resistance in Germany and other countries. Third, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Stability Mechanism accept the IMF\u2019s action plan. In this case, the primary surplus target should be lowered and generous debt relief should be provided. Undoubtedly, the three stakeholders in the Greek program have different political incentives. This makes a reasonable solution more difficult to reach. On the three possible ways forward outlined above, it seems the muddling-through approach would be the least productive but politics could continue to make it the dominant one. The remaining two approaches would face bigger political hurdles but could work better for all parties involved. After a slow start, European markets are edging higher. The FTSE 100 is up 0.3% while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.66% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.63%. Meanwhile US futures are showing the Dow Jones Industrial Average virtually unchanged, up around 8 points. Worries about the Greek bailout after the weekend\u2019s reported IMF threat have sent Greek bond yields higher. The two year yields climbed to a one month high of 11.15% while 10 year yields rose 26 basis points to 8.99%. The Greek bond prices are weakening following the report that the IMF threatened to leave the third bailout programme to put pressure on creditors - notably Germany - to reach a deal on debt relief. The IMF has denied this but managing director Christine Lagarde unsettled investors by saying the sides were a good distance away from a deal. The Athens stock market has also been hit, and is currently around 1.5% lower. Economist Stuart Culverhouse at distressed debt broker Exotix told Reuters: Markets are nervous that it could either delay progress on the subsequent reviews or lead to something more significant. I don\u2019t think there is much of a risk of default in the very near term but clearly if it absents official financing then it becomes more of a concern. Talks are due to restart today after a series of delays amid disagreements on the size of Greece\u2019s fiscal gap and the progress on pension reforms and bad debts. Here\u2019s the Greek payment schedule, courtesy of Bloomberg: The review of the Greek bailout programme is expected to be completed by the end of April or early May, according to a spokesman for the German finance ministry. But the Germans say a debt haircut is not on the agenda, Reuters is reporting, after the weekend\u2019s leak about supposed IMF plans. The spokesman said Germany was confident a solution would be found, but more work needed to be done. That tallies with comments from the EU: Here\u2019s our story on the weak UK construction figures: Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has repeated its earlier warning that Britain could lose its much-prized AAA rating if the country votes to leave the European Union. Writing an opinion piece on the Politico website, S&amp;P\u2019s chief sovereign ratings officer Moritz Kraemer said: When Britain last held a referendum on its European Union membership in 1975, the stakes were not nearly as high. The U.K. had joined the European community only two years earlier. But today, given the U.K.\u2019s deep political, financial and trading ties in Europe, an exit would be much more fraught \u2014 and the risks, when it comes to its credit worthiness, are therefore considerably higher. While Brexit supporters share a collective skepticism about the \u201cEuropean experiment,\u201d they lack consensus on what Britain\u2019s trading options and political alliances will look like outside of the EU. If the Brexit camp wins the vote on June 23, the U.K. would enter a protracted period of uncertainty while its people debate the alternative. Markets dislike uncertainty \u2014 especially protracted uncertainty \u2014 and this \u201cworking out\u201d period will likely have adverse credit consequences for the U.K... Brexit would further polarize the U.K.\u2019s political system, increase risks to effective, transparent and predictable policymaking, and diminish the U.K.\u2019s long-term sovereign creditworthiness. Brexit also heightens potential risks to economic growth and the balance of payments, as well as domestic political threats to territorial integrity. Consequently, a vote for \u201cLeave\u201d would likely lead Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s to lower the U.K.\u2019s AAA rating \u2014 a rating it has held, without interruption, since 1978. While the U.K.\u2019s rating would likely remain high given its many institutional, financial and economic strengths, the U.K. would lose its place in the increasingly exclusive club of AAA-rated sovereigns. The falls in the eurozone unemployment rate could slow down in the coming months, says Bert Colijn at ING Bank: While dark clouds packed over the Eurozone economy in the beginning of the year, the labour market has continued to provide tailwind. The improvements in unemployment continue to fuel domestic demand in times when consumers have become more cautious. This will likely mitigate the negative effects of people more concerned about the state of the global economy.The improvements are not evenly spread across the Eurozone though. France and Italy saw the number of unemployed increase in February, although in France this did not lead to a higher unemployment rate. Germany and Spain saw unemployment decline again, with the unemployment rate in Spain falling from 20.5% to 20.4%. The continued struggle to reduce unemployment in France and Italy will likely have a dampening effect on domestic demand in the coming months. While the labour market continues to improve, unemployment is known to be a lagging indicator. Surveys have recently indicated that employers are currently cautious to see how the market turmoil of the beginning of the year is playing out, which could result in more subdued hiring in the months ahead. The momentum of hiring is also not as strong as it was a few months back. The 3-month decline in unemployment has fallen from over half a million in September, to 224 thousand in February. With employers being cautious, this could mean that the relatively high pace of declines in the Eurozone unemployment rate over the past year could be slowing down somewhat in the months ahead. With the unemployment rate still well above its natural rate, that is bad news for price pressures. More data from the eurozone, with unemployment falling for a thirteenth successive month and producer prices dropping by more than expected in February. The unemployment rate fell from 10.4% to 10.3% but the jobless decline of 39,000 was the smallest drop since last May. Producer prices fell by 0.7% month on month compared to forecasts of a 0.5% decline. Meanwhile Peter Praet, chief economist at the European Central Bank, said it was prepared to ease monetary policy further if inflation remained stubbornly low. He said at an event in Rome (quote from Reuters): The prolonged period of low inflation we are in today has increased the risks that inflation misses might become persistent, which would be deeply damaging for the economy. This is why we have reacted so forcefully to secure our objective - and will continue to do so in the future if necessary. The UK construction data is disappointing, says economist Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: This is a largely disappointing survey, which suggests that construction output was of little help to GDP growth in the first quarter. Latest hard data show that construction output disappointingly dipped 0.2% month-on-month and 0.8% in January, marking a soft start to 2016. The government will be particularly disappointed to see housebuilding growth almost ground to a halt in March when it was at its weakest level since January 2013 - given that it is looking to address the UK\u2019s acute housing shortage. With the corresponding manufacturing survey also weak for March, first quarter GDP growth again looks to have been heavily dependent on the services sector \u2013 so much attention will be focused on the purchasing managers survey for the services sector for March that comes out on Tuesday, especially as the February survey was at a near three-year low. Furthermore, there is not much in the survey to indicate that the construction sector\u2019s fortunes are going to pick up in the near term as it shows orders growth at an 11-,month low, business expectations stuck at the lowest level since December 2014 and employment growth at the lowest level since mid-2013. The construction sector is seemingly currently being affected by increased caution among clients (especially for major projects) amid heightened UK and global economic uncertainties \u2013 and it notable that the purchasing managers indicated that clients are \u201cunwilling to commit to new contracts or expand existing work\u201d. The looming 23 June referendum on UK membership of the EU adds to the uncertainties dogging the construction sector \u2013 especially given the tightness of opinion polls. On a relatively encouraging note, the purchasing managers reported that \u201csurvey respondents cited a generally supportive economic backdrop\u201d Also on the positive side, there is increasing government support for housebuilding (which needs to see prolonged decent expansion to make genuine inroads into the UK\u2019s acute housing shortage). In November\u2019s Autumn Statement, the Chancellor announced plans to double the housing budget to over \u00a32 billion a year and to build 400,000 new affordable homes by the end of the decade. Additionally, the government has announced measures aimed at speeding up the planning system and reducing the obstacles to building new houses. Eurozone investor confidence has risen but by less than expected. The Sentix index came in at 5.7, up from 5.5 but below the forecast of 6.9. Even without the weekend\u2019s leaks about Greece, the talks with its lenders would have been difficult enough anyway: Telecom shares have been hit by Friday\u2019s news of the collapse of a \u20ac10bn deal between Orange and Bouygues to create a dominate French operator. Bouygues shares have slumped 14%, with the company heading for its worst day in 17 years. Markit senior economist Tim Moore said: March\u2019s survey confirms that the UK construction sector is experiencing its weakest growth phase since the summer of 2013. Residential building has seen the greatest loss of momentum through the first quarter of 2016, which is a surprising reversal of fortunes given strong market fundamentals and its clear outperformance over the past three years. Construction firms were reliant on a rebound in commercial building and resurgent civil engineering growth to offset the slowdown in housing activity. Civil engineering delivered its strongest performance for just over a year, suggesting that a healthy pipeline of infrastructure projects continues to boost construction output. However, heightened uncertainty about the business outlook appears to have weighed on overall construction demand so far in 2016, with survey respondents citing cautious client spending patterns and a reduced willingness to commit to new projects. As a result, volumes of new work disappointed in March as order book growth slipped for the third month in a row and reached its weakest since the pre-election blip last year. A better than expected performance from the construction industry in March still meant that overall expansion remained at its weakest in nearly a year. The Markit/CIPS UK construction purchasing managers index came in at 54.2 last month, the same as February\u2019s 10 month low but above forecasts of a dip to 54.1. The pace of growth picked up in commercial property and civil engineering but new home construction fell to its lowest level in three years.

With oil and industrial metal prices once again under pressure, market risks appear to be increasing and investors need to start asking themselves if commodity prices are potentially warning of a turning point in equity markets, just as they did during the first quarter of the year? The US Fed has gone to great pains to tell the market that the future path of US rate hikes will be data-dependent. Nevertheless, the market retains its Pavlovian response to any suggestions by the Fed of what it actually expects to do. That might help to explain how US equities rallied so strongly on Friday after a slew of solid economic data suggesting that the US economy continues to recover. Over in Spain, and the latest unemployment figures have come in better than expected. The number of people registered as unemployed fell by 1.4% or 58,216 people in March, leaving 4.09m out of work. This follows two months of rises, and compares with a forecast decline of 50,000. Back with Greece, and the government has denied it was behind the leak of the supposed IMF threat to push the country close to default. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports: The Greek government has brushed off suggestions that the government may be connected to the publication of a transcript of an apparently secretly recorded telephone conversation between IMF officials discussing the Greek bailout. \u201cGreece has no reason to leak or wiretap [conversations],\u201d junior Defense Minister Dimitris Vitsas said on Monday. \u201cThe most well-protected people in the country at the moment are the members of the negotiating team,\u201d Vitsas said. \u201cWe provide them with the best possible treatment.\u201d Stock markets are edging lower at the start of the week\u2019s trading, with oil prices on the slide again. Hopes of an agreement to curb supply at a meeting later this month appear to be dimming again, with Iran saying it plans to increase output until it gets back to its pre-sanction level. Other producers have said they would only take part in a freeze if Iran also agreed to a deal. So Brent crude has slipped nearly 1% to $38.29 a barrel. So the FTSE 100 is currently down around 8 points at 6138 while Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac are also slightly lower. In Asia the Nikkei 225 dipped 0.25%. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets and business. Greece is back in the spotlight after a weekend of leaks, claims and counter-claims. with reports that the International Monetary Fund would push the country close to default as part of a negotiating ploy on its bailout deal. The IMF has swiftly denied the idea but said a deal was still \u201ca good distance away.\u201d Documents released by WikiLeaks appeared to show senior officials from the IMF discussing tactics to apply pressure on Greece and its lenders - especially Germany - to reach a deal on the latest bailout agreement this month. Part of the transcript included a threat that the IMF might not participate in the third bailout programme as a way of forcing a deal on debt relief before the UK\u2019s referendum on whether or not to leave the European Union. Lenders are due to resume talks today on the progress of the reforms Greece needs to make as part of the bailout agreement, which should pave the way for some kind of debt restructuring. But the leaked documents have soured the mood, with Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras demanding that the IMF clarify its position. In response, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has released a letter dening the claims. She said: Any speculation that IMF staff would consider using a credit event as a negotiating tactic is simply nonsense.... The IMF conducts its negotiations in good faith, not by way of threats, and we do not communicate through leaks. She added: We are still a good distance away from having a coherent program that I can present to our Executive Board. I have on many occasions stressed that we can only support a program that is credible and based on realistic assumptions, and that delivers on its objective of setting Greece on a path of robust growth while gradually restoring debt sustainability. Elsewhere, on a fairly quiet day for economic news, there are eurozone consumer confidence and unemployment figures, the latest construction PMI data, as well as US durable goods orders. And we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the latest developments in the UK steel crisis, with unions due to meet today and various buyers said to be interested in some of the plants put up for sale by owner Tata. Here\u2019s our latest story on the Tata situation:",

The consequences of a vote to leave wouldn\u2019t just be felt temporarily. There would likely be a permanent reduction in exports to the EU, while foreign-direct investment into the UK would also suffer, leading to higher unemployment and a decline in the country\u2019s long-term growth potential. Furthermore, negotiations to leave would be complex and difficult. EU leaders would not be expected to give the UK an easy ride for fear of encouraging others to follow.</p> <p>Looking further ahead, the likely reduction in exports to the EU could reduce national income by three per cent, rising to as much as ten per cent in a worst-case scenario. Finally, the long-term growth potential of the UK could also be negatively impacted by, amongst other things, lower foreign direct investment. While any estimate of that effect is highly speculative, it could potentially shave 0.2-0.4 percentage points off growth.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3d85a6a7f10c4049bd1c554965109955080df8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d85a6a7f10c4049bd1c554965109955080df8c/66_314_5629_3377/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aviva Investors warns on Brexit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aviva Investors warns on Brexit</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Financial markets would undoubtedly react badly to a vote in favour of \u2018Brexit\u2019 too. Aviva Investors would expect an immediate and sharp fall in the pound. The UK runs comparatively large fiscal and current account deficits, and as such relies on foreign capital to finance the deficiency in domestic saving. If, as anticipated, the uncertainty created by a vote to leave causes international investors to re-appraise their appetite for sterling assets, the decline in the pound could become more severe over time.</p> <p>While the Bank of England would no doubt ease policy in response to any economic downturn, it seems unlikely this would prevent UK share prices from falling sharply. In particular, shares in smaller companies, which tend to rely more on the domestic economy, would probably underperform. The impact on gilts is less clear.

But this is one-cylinder growth led by urban private consumption, and we believe it is not sustainable,\u201d Mr. Gruenwald said.</p> <p>We are maintaining our China GDP growth forecasts of 6.3% for 2016 and 6.1% for 2017. China continues to dominate discussions of the Asia-Pacific (and, at times, global) economic and financial landscape.

Monetary conditions are tighter than desired, mainly because of Japan\u2019s safe-haven status in the markets, which leads to a strong yen.</p> <p>The task for other Asia-Pacific economies will be to ensure that flexible markets and sound policies will help them to adjust successfully to China\u2019s new growth drivers.</p> <p>One of the countries to watch for a successful response to China\u2019s rebalancing is Australia. We think that all of the pieces to make this happen are in place--including exchange rate and factor market flexibility, strong government, and nimble financing--but it may take time.

This surprised analysts as they had expected retail sales to have remained stable in February. This is the highest reading of retail sales since February 2008, which was the pre-crisis peak.</p> <p>Even though Eurozone consumers are wary of the global economic and political situation, the sharp downturn in consumer confidence over the past months is not yet having much of an impact on retail trade.

With the manufacturing and construction PMIs remaining little changed (but at least staying in growth territory) the overall composite index has risen to 53.6 from 52.7. This is still well down on the average level of 2015 and suggests that the UK economy has lost momentum at the start of the year.</p> <p>An obvious factor behind this is the upcoming referendum on the UK\u2019s ongoing membership of the European Union. With opinion polls suggesting that the vote will be incredibly close, businesses are likely to act cautiously and not embark on any significant expansion plans until the economic outlook is clearer. This means that investment and labour hiring plans will be more limited, which is something that was also highlighted in the recent Deloitte CFO survey. As such, the economy looks set to post slower growth in the second quarter of 2016 than in first quarter.</p> <p>Should the UK vote to remain within the EU then we suggest that the slowdown will be temporary and the delayed hiring and investment plans will be re\u2014instated, leading to a decent bounce in activity in the second half of 2016.</p> <p>However, should the UK vote to leave then expansion plans are likely to be cancelled, business and consumer sentiment will take a hit and the Bank of England would likely have to step in with policy stimulus to try and shore-up confidence.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57037b75e4b0fde262ff64b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T08:47:00.588Z\">9.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Still, it was at least growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RBS_Economics/status/717271838548692992\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Weakest UK service sector growth since Q1 2013, but growth none the less and March&#39;s number was a slight improvement <a href=\"https://t.co/TS6rM42Xi3\">pic.twitter.com/TS6rM42Xi3</a></p>&mdash; RBS Economics (@RBS_Economics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RBS_Economics/status/717271838548692992\">April 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-570379dde4b0d29fa4d0c821\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T08:42:57.206Z\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The PMI figures seem to suggest a UK interest rate rise is indeed some way off.

The surveys point to a 0.4% increase in GDP, down from 0.6% in the closing quarter of last year. </p> <p>Across the three main sectors of the economy, firms reported the smallest increase in demand for just over three years, which in turn fed through to a reluctance to take on new staff. March saw the weakest rate of job creation for over two-and-a-half years. </p> <p>Business confidence remains in the doldrums as concerns about the global economy continue to be exacerbated by uncertainty at home, with nerves unsettled by issues such as Brexit and the prospect of further government spending cuts announced in the Budget.</p> <p>It therefore seems unlikely that March\u2019s upturn in the pace of growth represents the start of a longer term upswing. In contrast, the survey data suggest growth is more likely to weaken further in the second quarter. With the PMI already in territory traditionally associated with the Bank of England choosing to loosen policy, interest rate hikes seem a long way off. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57037987e4b0d29fa4d0c820\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T08:39:09.151Z\">9.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Commenting on the PMIs, Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>UK service sector growth remained sluggish in March, according to the latest PMI survey data from Markit and CIPS.

Moreover, incoming new business increased at the slowest rate since January 2013. </p> <p>Global economic uncertainty and the upcoming EU membership referendum were commonly reported to be factors undermining service sector business expectations during the month. Employment in the sector continued to rise, but at a rate little-changed from February\u2019s recent low. The latest survey data did signal a rise in inflationary pressures, particularly for charges which increased at the fastest rate in over two years. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-570378e4e4b0fde262ff64b6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T08:38:27.640Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markit says the UK has seen the weakest quarter of output growth for three years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MarkitEconomics/status/717269327699951616\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">March Markit/CIPS <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UK?src=hash\">#UK</a> Services <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PMI?src=hash\">#PMI</a> completes weakest quarter of output growth since Q1 2013 <a href=\"https://t.co/CFpLytU5QY\">https://t.co/CFpLytU5QY</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DRhVzyRrhe\">pic.twitter.com/DRhVzyRrhe</a></p>&mdash; Markit Economics (@MarkitEconomics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkitEconomics/status/717269327699951616\">April 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5703779ce4b0d29fa4d0c819\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T08:34:31.119Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK service sector sees only slow recovery</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Worries about the global economy, as well as the prospect of leaving the European Union, have helped to hold back the UK service sector.</p> <p>The Markit survey for March shows only a slight recovery after the index reached its lowest level in three years in February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SigmaSquawk/status/717268201147666433\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UK Services PMI (Mar) 53.7 versus 53.5 expected, previous 52.7 | Composite PMI (Mar) 53.6 versus 53.4 expected, previous 52.8 revised 52.7</p>&mdash; Sigma Squawk (@SigmaSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SigmaSquawk/status/717268201147666433\">April 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5703769ce4b0d29fa4d0c815\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T08:28:26.163Z\">9.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The March eurozone PMIs could knock back forecasts for the region\u2019s growth this year, said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A setback to hopes that the Eurozone economy may just be starting to improve after a dreary start to 2016 as the March services purchasing managers index was revised down markedly to be at a 14-month low</p> <p>This meant that overall Eurozone services and manufacturing activity could only edge up in March from the 13-month low suffered in February.</p> <p>The downward revision to the March services PMI fuels concern that Eurozone GDP growth in the first quarter of 2016 was no better than the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter rate seen in both the fourth and third quarters of 2015.

This increase is largely due to growing common exposures to aggregate risk, caused partly by a rise in insurers\u2019 interest rate sensitivity. Thus, in the event of an adverse shock, insurers are unlikely to fulfill their role as financial intermediaries precisely when other parts of the financial system are failing to do so as well. The higher common exposures do not seem to be driven by marked changes in insurers\u2019 investment portfolios, although smaller and weaker insurers in some countries have taken on more risk.</p> <p>The findings suggest that supervisors and regulators should take a more macroprudential approach to the sector. Doing so is necessary if supervision is to go beyond guarding against the solvency and contagion risks of individ- ual firms and take on the systemic risk arising from common exposures. Steps that would complement a push for stronger macroprudential policies include the international adoption of capital and transparency standards for the sector. In addition, the different behavior of smaller and weaker insurers warrants attention by supervisors. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d7e255ca92620d3a7cfea6694f46dd64ca0776a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d7e255ca92620d3a7cfea6694f46dd64ca0776a/0_0_584_637/458.jpg\" alt=\"Relative size of financial firms\" width=\"458\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Relative size of financial firms</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IMF</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57036073e4b0f2216ccb2a59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T07:02:02.180Z\">8.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Policymakers need to act to prevent problems in emerging markets threatening global stability, the IMF has said.</p> <p>In <strong><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2016/POL040416B.htm\">excerpts from its latest financial stability report</a></strong> the fund said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The financial integration of emerging market economies into the global economy has affected international financial markets in both desirable ways\u2014more efficient asset prices and resource allocation\u2014and undesirable ones\u2014amplification of shocks and transmission of excess financial volatility...</p> <p>The significant growth in global capital flows due to mutual fund investments is also affecting the nature and size of financial spillovers from emerging market economies. The decision by mutual funds to sell investments in multiple countries in response to losses in one or more countries, or because of withdrawals by their own investors, is called the portfolio channel of contagion. This channel has gained in importance as a source of financial spillovers from emerging market economies to equity markets in recent years, in line with the increase in asset allocation to these countries. The impact from the portfolio channel from advanced economies remains significantly larger, according to the IMF.</p> </blockquote> <p>The IMF says the influence of China will grow as it becomes more integrated into the global financial system:</p> <blockquote> <p>The IMF research shows that among large emerging market economies, China is unique: news about its economic growth has an economically significant and rising impact on global equity prices. In the last five years alone, the impact of growth surprises from China on global equity prices has almost quadrupled. By contrast, changes in Chinese asset prices tend to have little effect on asset prices elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cPurely financial spillovers from China are still very small, but likely to grow considerably as China gradually continues to integrate into the global financial system,\u201d said Gaston Gelos, head of the Global Financial Stability Analysis Division at the IMF.</p> </blockquote> <p>So policymakers need to act to safeguard financial stability in the wake of the growing importance of emerging markets:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe evidence underscores the need for policymakers to take into account economic and policy developments in emerging market economies when assessing their own countries\u2019 prospects,\u201d said Gelos. </p> <p>Enhanced international economic and macroprudential policy cooperation can also play an important role.</p> <p>Other policy measures countries need to implement include:</p> <p>\u2022 In emerging market economies, policymakers can foster the development of a domestic investor base to help dampen the effect of international financial contagion.</p> <p>\u2022 As China\u2019s role in the global financial system continues to grow, policymakers will need clear and timely communication of policy decisions, transparency about policy goals, and strategies to achieve them. </p> <p>\u2022 The amplification of emerging markets\u2019 financial impact on other countries due to corporate debt means policymakers should adopt measures to limit excessive increases in corporate debt that could threaten financial stability.

                "bodyText":"The US service sector grew by more than forecast in March, according to Markit, but not enough to mask concerns about the overall state of the world\u2019s largest economy The services final PMI came in at 51.3 compared to an initial estimate of 51 and the 49.7 figure for February. The composite PMI - services and manufacturing - rose from 50 in February to 51.3 in March, up from the first reading of 51.1. But the new business index hit its lowest level since the survey began in October 2009. \uf0a7 Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: The welcome news of sustained robust hiring in March, as indicated by both the PMI surveys and non-farm payroll numbers, masks a more worrying picture of a further slowing in economic growth so far this year. The survey data, which have historically provided a reliable guide to official GDP numbers, suggest the annualized pace of economic growth weakened to 0.7% in the first quarter. Demand is growing at the slowest rate since late- 2009 and, with business optimism also sliding to its weakest since the recession, firms clearly expect worse to come. Firms are worried about a potential weakening of demand both at home and abroad in the face of various headwinds. As such, the data support the cautious approach to policy tightening currently advocated by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll back tomorrow. The combination of volatile oil prices, the IMF warning of risks to the global economy, and a spate of uninspiring economic data has seen Wall Street follow other markets into the red. On top of all that, there is the added wrinkle of uncertainty over the path of US interest rates, ahead of Wednesday\u2019s release of the minutes from the March Federal Reserve meeting. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 105 points or 0.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.4% and Nasdaq 0.7% at the open. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 2.5% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 2.3%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is currently down 1.1%. America\u2019s trade deficit widened by more than expected in February, up 2.6% to $47.1bn rather than the $46.2bn forecast by analysts. An revival in exports was offset by an increase in imports, making the deficit the highest since August. With the yen at a 17 month high against the dollar despite Japan\u2019s negative interest rates, it is no surprise there have been suggestions the country\u2019s central bank could be prepared to act again. Now Reuters is reporting that it will consider further measures at its meeting this month: Bank of Japan policymakers will likely debate the possibility of easing monetary policy further at a rate review this month, as a raft of gloomy data threatens their scenario that a moderate economic recovery will accelerate inflation towards a 2 percent target, sources familiar with their thinking said. If the central bank were to act, it would more likely increase asset purchases than cut interest rates, the sources said, as financial institutions are still scrambling to adjust to a negative rate policy deployed in January. But a decision on whether to ease at the April 27-28 review will be a close call as many BOJ officials are wary of using their limited policy tools again so soon, especially as the negative rate move has proved unpopular among the public. \u201cIt will be a question of whether the BOJ feels it has forestalled risks in January or whether they feel that January\u2019s action wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d said one of the people familiar with the BOJ\u2019s thinking. The BOJ stunned markets in January by adding negative interest rates to its massive asset-buying programme, dubbed \u201cquantitative and qualitative easing,\u201d to forestall the risk of external headwinds derailing a fragile economic recovery. But the move failed to boost stock prices or arrest an unwelcome yen rise, drawing criticism from lawmakers and investors as confusing rather than calming markets. The latest warning from the IMF follows a familiar pattern, but the fund has to do more than just talk, says Larry Elliott. It needs to act as well. His full analysis is here: Britain could enter a recession at the end of 2016 if it votes to leave the European Union, according to strategists at Aviva Investors. They said: Aviva Investors believes that if the UK were to vote to leave the EU, there would be a significant and negative knock-on effect on business sentiment, which would likely push the UK economy into recession towards the end of this year. The consequences of a vote to leave wouldn\u2019t just be felt temporarily. There would likely be a permanent reduction in exports to the EU, while foreign-direct investment into the UK would also suffer, leading to higher unemployment and a decline in the country\u2019s long-term growth potential. Furthermore, negotiations to leave would be complex and difficult. EU leaders would not be expected to give the UK an easy ride for fear of encouraging others to follow. Looking further ahead, the likely reduction in exports to the EU could reduce national income by three per cent, rising to as much as ten per cent in a worst-case scenario. Finally, the long-term growth potential of the UK could also be negatively impacted by, amongst other things, lower foreign direct investment. While any estimate of that effect is highly speculative, it could potentially shave 0.2-0.4 percentage points off growth. Financial markets would undoubtedly react badly to a vote in favour of \u2018Brexit\u2019 too. Aviva Investors would expect an immediate and sharp fall in the pound. The UK runs comparatively large fiscal and current account deficits, and as such relies on foreign capital to finance the deficiency in domestic saving. If, as anticipated, the uncertainty created by a vote to leave causes international investors to re-appraise their appetite for sterling assets, the decline in the pound could become more severe over time. While the Bank of England would no doubt ease policy in response to any economic downturn, it seems unlikely this would prevent UK share prices from falling sharply. In particular, shares in smaller companies, which tend to rely more on the domestic economy, would probably underperform. The impact on gilts is less clear. They may benefit from some domestic safe-haven flows, but at the same time, many international investors will be looking to sell. The continuing slide in crude prices follows the growing belief that a meeting in Doha this month to discuss production freezes to deal with the supply glut may not come up with anything concrete. So oil could see further volatility ahead, according to Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst Nordic bank SEB: The latest price moves to the downside was an accident waiting to happen as far as we can see. We never could believe why much hope at all was placed on the production freeze discussion and the connected Doha meeting on 17 April. Nonetheless it probably helped to hold Brent in a sideways trading range during most of March as well as helping to build up a record net long speculative position in Brent crude. Then with Saudi Arabia\u2019s straight talk on production freeze placing the whole issue in the Iranian camp, the continuous building in Brent speculation halted and is now instead in reverse. Crude is also being hit by an unexpected fall in gasoline demand in the US, as revealed by the Energy Information Administration on Monday. In the wake of the IMF worrying about emerging markets, ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s reckons the Asia-Pacific region will still lead global growth this year despite its tumultuous start to the year. In a new report, it said: \u201cWe believe the market\u2019s concerns leading up to the sell-off in global markets, while having some validity, were overdone--and even a bit misguided,\u201d said Paul Gruenwald, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s chief economist for Asia-Pacific. \u201cWe think that the real challenge is picking up the pace of structural reforms China needs to implement as it moves toward a more consumption- and services-based model with a greater role for the marketplace.\u201d Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s GDP forecast for the region is little changed from November 2015 at 5.3% for 2016 and 5.2% for 2017. \u201cIndia leads the pack with GDP growth projection of 7.9% for the fiscal year ending March 2017. But this is one-cylinder growth led by urban private consumption, and we believe it is not sustainable,\u201d Mr. Gruenwald said. We are maintaining our China GDP growth forecasts of 6.3% for 2016 and 6.1% for 2017. China continues to dominate discussions of the Asia-Pacific (and, at times, global) economic and financial landscape. But gone are the days when forceful, effective, and timely macroeconomic stimulus by Chinese authorities supported domestic (and global) growth and calmed global markets. \u201cMarkets have now shifted their focus to the Chinese currency markets, with the macroeconomic story relegated to a secondary plot,\u201d Mr. Gruenwald said. We have lowered our Japan 2016 GDP growth forecast to 0.8% (from 1.1%) due to a weak finish in 2015 and have kept our 2017 forecast of 0.4% unchanged. This will be a tough year for the Bank of Japan\u2019s reflation program. Monetary conditions are tighter than desired, mainly because of Japan\u2019s safe-haven status in the markets, which leads to a strong yen. The task for other Asia-Pacific economies will be to ensure that flexible markets and sound policies will help them to adjust successfully to China\u2019s new growth drivers. One of the countries to watch for a successful response to China\u2019s rebalancing is Australia. We think that all of the pieces to make this happen are in place--including exchange rate and factor market flexibility, strong government, and nimble financing--but it may take time. We see growth of 2.5%-3% over the next few years, but will be monitoring the composition of investment and exports away from the mining sector. Finally, it is unlikely that the rest of the world will come to the rescue. Reform looks like the only path to higher growth for Asia-Pacific. Falling consumer confidence does not seem to have had much impact on eurozone retail sales, said Bert Colijn of ING Bank, thanks to low inflation and higher disposable income: The worthless start of the year for financial markets still has not impacted consumption in the Eurozone much, as retail trade increased with 0.2% month-on-month and 2.4% year-on-year. This surprised analysts as they had expected retail sales to have remained stable in February. This is the highest reading of retail sales since February 2008, which was the pre-crisis peak. Even though Eurozone consumers are wary of the global economic and political situation, the sharp downturn in consumer confidence over the past months is not yet having much of an impact on retail trade. Negative inflation has been enticing to consumers and stores are profiting. Besides that, the unemployment rate continued to decline in February, which is helping disposable income grow. The months ahead could still be bleaker though as the labour market has lost a bit of its momentum in the first months of the year and today\u2019s Eurozone service sector PMI indicated a slowdown of growth in March. This means that some weakness could still be ahead of us, but the current pace of sales growth is a good sign for the overall performance of the Eurozone economy in the first quarter. Retail sales in the eurozone rose by 0.2% month on month in February and 2.4% year on year, better than analysts had been forecasting. According to a Reuters poll, the month on month figure was expected to be flat and the annual rise 1.9%. Growing demand in France and Spain helped offset a fall in Germany, according to the EU statistics office Eurostat. Sales in Germany fell 0.4% month on month after a 0.1% dip in January. But sales in France rose 0.6% and 0.2% in Spain. Back with the day\u2019s eurozone data, and RBC Capital Markets says it was a mixed picture, particularly for Spain and Italy: An improvement in the headline composite PMI reading for both Spain and Italy disguises a more mixed picture from the details. For Spain, an improvement in the services sector suggests that domestic activity remains relatively resilient in the face of its political paralysis but the Italian services reading points to a worrying slowing in the rate of domestic expansion even if a stronger manufacturing reading compensated this month. Overall, the euro area reading was revised down to 53.1 from the flash of 53.7 leaving it broadly unchanged since February. Taken together, the PMIs are still pointing to growth of 0.4% in the first quarter although we would note that they did somewhat overstate the pace of the recovery the previous quarter. Of equal concern will be the continuing weakness of both input and output prices which remain in negative territory. The uncertainty over the EU referendum is a major reason for the UK economy losing momentum, says James Knightley at ING Bank: The UK\u2019s service sector purchasing managers\u2019 index has risen a fraction more than expected to stand at 53.7 in March versus 52.7 in February (consensus was 53.5). With the manufacturing and construction PMIs remaining little changed (but at least staying in growth territory) the overall composite index has risen to 53.6 from 52.7. This is still well down on the average level of 2015 and suggests that the UK economy has lost momentum at the start of the year. An obvious factor behind this is the upcoming referendum on the UK\u2019s ongoing membership of the European Union. With opinion polls suggesting that the vote will be incredibly close, businesses are likely to act cautiously and not embark on any significant expansion plans until the economic outlook is clearer. This means that investment and labour hiring plans will be more limited, which is something that was also highlighted in the recent Deloitte CFO survey. As such, the economy looks set to post slower growth in the second quarter of 2016 than in first quarter. Should the UK vote to remain within the EU then we suggest that the slowdown will be temporary and the delayed hiring and investment plans will be re\u2014instated, leading to a decent bounce in activity in the second half of 2016. However, should the UK vote to leave then expansion plans are likely to be cancelled, business and consumer sentiment will take a hit and the Bank of England would likely have to step in with policy stimulus to try and shore-up confidence. Still, it was at least growth: The PMI figures seem to suggest a UK interest rate rise is indeed some way off. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: An upturn in the pace of service sector growth in March was insufficient to prevent the PMI surveys from collectively indicating a slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter. The surveys point to a 0.4% increase in GDP, down from 0.6% in the closing quarter of last year. Across the three main sectors of the economy, firms reported the smallest increase in demand for just over three years, which in turn fed through to a reluctance to take on new staff. March saw the weakest rate of job creation for over two-and-a-half years. Business confidence remains in the doldrums as concerns about the global economy continue to be exacerbated by uncertainty at home, with nerves unsettled by issues such as Brexit and the prospect of further government spending cuts announced in the Budget. It therefore seems unlikely that March\u2019s upturn in the pace of growth represents the start of a longer term upswing. In contrast, the survey data suggest growth is more likely to weaken further in the second quarter. With the PMI already in territory traditionally associated with the Bank of England choosing to loosen policy, interest rate hikes seem a long way off. Commenting on the PMIs, Markit said: UK service sector growth remained sluggish in March, according to the latest PMI survey data from Markit and CIPS. Total activity increased at a slightly faster rate than in February, but on a quarterly basis growth over the first three months of 2016 was the weakest since the first quarter of 2013. Moreover, incoming new business increased at the slowest rate since January 2013. Global economic uncertainty and the upcoming EU membership referendum were commonly reported to be factors undermining service sector business expectations during the month. Employment in the sector continued to rise, but at a rate little-changed from February\u2019s recent low. The latest survey data did signal a rise in inflationary pressures, particularly for charges which increased at the fastest rate in over two years. Markit says the UK has seen the weakest quarter of output growth for three years: Worries about the global economy, as well as the prospect of leaving the European Union, have helped to hold back the UK service sector. The Markit survey for March shows only a slight recovery after the index reached its lowest level in three years in February. The March eurozone PMIs could knock back forecasts for the region\u2019s growth this year, said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: A setback to hopes that the Eurozone economy may just be starting to improve after a dreary start to 2016 as the March services purchasing managers index was revised down markedly to be at a 14-month low This meant that overall Eurozone services and manufacturing activity could only edge up in March from the 13-month low suffered in February. The downward revision to the March services PMI fuels concern that Eurozone GDP growth in the first quarter of 2016 was no better than the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter rate seen in both the fourth and third quarters of 2015. Indeed, the composite PMI manufacturing and services output index for the Eurozone dipped to 53.2 in the first quarter of 2016 from 54.1 in the fourth quarter of 2015; this was the lowest quarterly average since the fourth quarter of 2014. However, it should be borne in mind that January hard data for industrial production and retail sales were healthy. Specifically, industrial production jumped 2.1% month on month and 2.8% year on year in January while there was also relatively solid retail sales volume growth of 0.4% month on month and 2.0% year on year in January On balance, we still believe that the Eurozone can achieve GDP growth of 1.6% in 2016, which would match the 2015 outturn. However, the risks to this forecast are clearly slanted to the downside. The market slide is accelerating, with the oil price falling further and the Dax hit particularly hard by the poor factory orders data from Germany. The disappointing service sector data is also hitting sentiment, as well as the downbeat comments from the IMF, with Christine Lagarde warning of risks to the global economy. The FTSE 100 is now down 1.2% while the Dax has dropped just over 2%. France\u2019s Cac is 1.7% lower. Meanwhile Brent crude is 0.7% lower at $37.43 a barrel. The final reading for the eurozone services PMI has shown a dip from the previous month, and is lower than the initial readings suggested. The Markit index came in a 53.1 for March, down from 53.3 in February and lower than the first estimate of 54. The composite index for the eurozone - manufacturing and services - came in at 53.1, up from 53 in February but lower than the initial reading of 53.7. Markit said: March saw the rate of economic expansion in the euro area improve for the first time in three months. The extent of the acceleration was negligible, however, and less marked than that indicated by earlier flash data. Manufacturing saw faster growth of production, but this was mostly offset by a slower rate of output expansion at service providers. Markit said the downward revision to the initial composite reading was mainly driven by France and Italy, which between them accounted for 0.5 points of the 0.6 fall. Germany\u2019s services PMI has also come in below expectations. The index came in at 55.1 in March, down from 55.3 in the previous month and below expectations of a rise to 55.5. The composite index is at an eight month low. Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said: The German service sector continued to expand at a solid pace at the end of the first quarter, although activity and new order inflows both increased at weaker rates. Moreover, a closer look at the sub- indices highlights some concerns that growth may slow further in coming months. In detail, the amount of work in the pipeline rose only marginally and companies took a more cautious approach with regards to hiring policies, with the rate of job creation the weakest since last July. Meanwhile, input costs faced by service providers rose at the slowest pace for more than six years, as the low interest rate environment continued to exert downward pressure on inflation. Elsewhere Italy also saw a slowdown in service sector growth: And also in the composite PMI: The French service sector has failed to improve as much as expected in March. The Markit survey shows the services PMI still below 50, a sign of contraction, against expectations of a figure of 51.2: The composite index - manufacturing and services - did hit 50, however, up from 49.3 in February and reaching a two month high. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, said: March PMI data round off a broadly flat performance of the French service sector on average over the first quarter. There remains little sign of the stagnancy lifting \u2013 although business expectations rose to the highest since last August they remain subdued in historical terms. Competitive pressures saw another round of output price cutting as firms competed for new business, underlining the challenging environment. There are also positive service sector figures from Spain, according to Markit. It said: Growth in the Spanish service sector quickened at the end of the first quarter of the year, with both activity and new orders rising at the fastest rates in four months. An increase in outstanding business was also recorded, and higher workloads encouraged further job creation. The rate of input cost inflation remained relatively weak, but companies raised their output prices for the first time since last October. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the report said: The pick-up in service sector growth in March is something of a relief following a slowdown in previous months, and suggests that the Spanish economy was able to maintain forward momentum during the first quarter of the year. Elsewhere, while output prices were raised for the first time in five months, there is still little evidence of any meaningful inflationary pressure returning to the sector. The yen has hit a 17 month high against the dollar, prompting talk of possible intervention: The yen has been boosted by its status as a haven for investors as equities fall back and commodity prices slide. Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura, told Reuters: Clearly risk sentiment is not good and oil prices are declining this week and all these feeding and driving the dollar lower against the yen. The yen is also higher against other currencies. Of course, the Bank of Japan will be concerned not just about the rise in the yen, but also a drop in stock prices. So we may see some comments from the authorities there, but actual intervention is unlikely until dollar drops below 110 yen. The Irish service sector expanded more quickly in March, according to Markit. Philip O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland said: The latest Investec Services PMI Ireland report shows a slight quickening in the rate of growth of business activity, with the headline PMI improving to 62.8 in March from the previous month\u2019s 62.1 reading. This improvement was in spite of a softening in New Orders (to a five month low, albeit it is still in growth territory), while New Export Orders eased to their slowest pace of growth since May 2012. On the latter, while panellists indicated that the UK remained a source of new business, there were suggestions that the recent strengthening of the euro against sterling had weighed on growth of new business. Another warning from the IMF on the global economy, from managing director Christine Lagarde. Katie Allen writes: Governments must urgently pursue more growth-friendly policies to shore up a weakening global economy beset with risks, the head of the International Monetary Fund has said. Christine Lagarde also put governments on alert that they should prepare contingency plans in case threats to the fragile global economy materialise. \u201cThe good news is that the recovery continues. We have growth. We are not in a crisis. The not-so-good news is that the recovery remains too slow, too fragile, and risks to its durability are increasing,\u201d Lagarde said in a lecture at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. \u201cWe are on alert, not alarm. There has been a loss of growth momentum. However, if policymakers can confront the challenges and act together, the positive effects on global confidence, and the global economy, will be substantial,\u201d she said, according to text of her speech. The full story is here: With metal prices and oil falling back, it\u2019s no surprise that commodity companies are among the biggest losers so far. The top fallers in the FTSE 100 are: Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: London\u2019s FTSE-100 has started the session with some notable losses as tumbling commodity prices find themselves back at the top of the agenda. Hopes may have been building that we would see another leg higher emerge for the asset class, but yesterday saw the Dow Jones Non Ferrous Metals Index slump almost 5% and WTI crude is eyeing a move back below $35/barrel, too. As a result it\u2019s the natural resources stocks that are scattered across the foot of the index in early trade, with Royal Dutch Shell and BP also being dragged very much into the fray. Interest rate watch: the Reserve Bank of Australia left rates unchanged at 2% as expected, while the Reserve Bank of India cut its main interest rate by 0.25% to 6.5%. As forecast, stock markets in Europe have followed their Asian counterparts with sharp falls in early trading. The FTSE 100 is down 61 points or 1%, while Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 1.8% after the poor factory order figures and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 1.4%, while Spain\u2019s Ibex is 1.3% lower. The IMF is also concerned about the insurance sector: Across advanced economies the contribution of life insurers to systemic risk has increased in recent years, although it clearly remains below that of banks. This increase is largely due to growing common exposures to aggregate risk, caused partly by a rise in insurers\u2019 interest rate sensitivity. Thus, in the event of an adverse shock, insurers are unlikely to fulfill their role as financial intermediaries precisely when other parts of the financial system are failing to do so as well. The higher common exposures do not seem to be driven by marked changes in insurers\u2019 investment portfolios, although smaller and weaker insurers in some countries have taken on more risk. The findings suggest that supervisors and regulators should take a more macroprudential approach to the sector. Doing so is necessary if supervision is to go beyond guarding against the solvency and contagion risks of individ- ual firms and take on the systemic risk arising from common exposures. Steps that would complement a push for stronger macroprudential policies include the international adoption of capital and transparency standards for the sector. In addition, the different behavior of smaller and weaker insurers warrants attention by supervisors. Policymakers need to act to prevent problems in emerging markets threatening global stability, the IMF has said. In excerpts from its latest financial stability report the fund said: The financial integration of emerging market economies into the global economy has affected international financial markets in both desirable ways\u2014more efficient asset prices and resource allocation\u2014and undesirable ones\u2014amplification of shocks and transmission of excess financial volatility... The significant growth in global capital flows due to mutual fund investments is also affecting the nature and size of financial spillovers from emerging market economies. The decision by mutual funds to sell investments in multiple countries in response to losses in one or more countries, or because of withdrawals by their own investors, is called the portfolio channel of contagion. This channel has gained in importance as a source of financial spillovers from emerging market economies to equity markets in recent years, in line with the increase in asset allocation to these countries. The impact from the portfolio channel from advanced economies remains significantly larger, according to the IMF. The IMF says the influence of China will grow as it becomes more integrated into the global financial system: The IMF research shows that among large emerging market economies, China is unique: news about its economic growth has an economically significant and rising impact on global equity prices. In the last five years alone, the impact of growth surprises from China on global equity prices has almost quadrupled. By contrast, changes in Chinese asset prices tend to have little effect on asset prices elsewhere. \u201cPurely financial spillovers from China are still very small, but likely to grow considerably as China gradually continues to integrate into the global financial system,\u201d said Gaston Gelos, head of the Global Financial Stability Analysis Division at the IMF. So policymakers need to act to safeguard financial stability in the wake of the growing importance of emerging markets: \u201cThe evidence underscores the need for policymakers to take into account economic and policy developments in emerging market economies when assessing their own countries\u2019 prospects,\u201d said Gelos. Enhanced international economic and macroprudential policy cooperation can also play an important role. Other policy measures countries need to implement include: \u2022 In emerging market economies, policymakers can foster the development of a domestic investor base to help dampen the effect of international financial contagion. \u2022 As China\u2019s role in the global financial system continues to grow, policymakers will need clear and timely communication of policy decisions, transparency about policy goals, and strategies to achieve them. \u2022 The amplification of emerging markets\u2019 financial impact on other countries due to corporate debt means policymakers should adopt measures to limit excessive increases in corporate debt that could threaten financial stability. Improving rules to limit systemic risks arising from mutual funds also remains important. \u2022 Lastly, improving data on cross-border financial flows intermediated by banks, investment funds, and large institutional investors is a priority. German factory orders fell unexpectedly in February, according to figures from the economy ministry, hit by a decline in overseas demand. They dropped 1.2%, the biggest monthly fall in six months and well below expectations of a 0.2% rise. Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said: German new orders dropped sharply in February, adding to evidence of continued stagnation in the German industry. New orders declined by 1.2% month on month, from an upwardly revised increase of 0.5% month on month in January. On the year, new orders were up by 0.5%. The last months have not been easy for the German industry. Since May last year, new orders have dropped in six out of ten months. Interestingly, the February drop was driven by falling foreign demand (-2.7% month on month), whole domestic demand picked up somewhat after a two-months slump. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets and business. Stock markets are under pressure again as the International Monetary Fund warned of the knock on effect from growing problems in emerging markets, and oil prices slipped again. Brent crude is down 0.3% at $37.57 a barrel, as hopes of a deal to curb production at this month\u2019s planned meeting of producers continue to fade. The Nikkei 225 is down 2.4%, while the Hang Seng is 1.4% lower. European markets are expected to open lower: Investors will be keen to see the results of the latest services PMI data from Europe and the UK. There was an improvement in the initial March estimates from France, up from 49.2 to 51.2, the best figures since before the Paris terror attacks last year. Expectations are for the final data to show an improvement, with better numbers also forecast for Spain, Italy and Germany. However the recent attacks in Brussels could well have had an effect on sentiment. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Since these previous readings the Brussels terror attacks could well had an impact on sentiment, particularly in the travel and hotel sector, which has driven a lot of the improvement in the French numbers. There is a fear that events in Brussels could well have knocked confidence in a sector that appeared to be on the cusp of a fragile recovery. Today\u2019s numbers could well be the first test of that sentiment. In the UK, analysts will look for any signs that the recent Brexit headlines have hit sentiment. Hewson said: Last month we saw the sector post its weakest reading since April 2013 at 52.7. Was this merely a blip or evidence of an element of caution as we head towards the summer vote? Expectations are for a decent end to the first quarter with an improvement to 54, from February\u2019s 52.7.",

The $160bn (\u00a3113bn) deal, announced in November, was thrown into doubt following the move by the US Treasury on Monday to make so-called tax inversion deals, by which corporations relocate their headquarters to countries with a lower tax rate, less financially appealing. The companies said on Wednesday that the deal had been terminated \u201cby mutual agreement,\u201d a decision \u201cdriven by the actions announced by the U.S. Department of Treasury on April 4, 2016, which the companies concluded qualified as an \u201cAdverse Tax Law Change\u201d under the merger agreement.\u201d Shares in Botox producer Allergan crashed nearly 20% in after-hours trading on Monday , following speculation that the deal would be affected by the US government move. Barack Obama called on Congress to close \u201cone of the most insidious tax loopholes out there\u201d, saying it shortchanges the country. The president said less tax revenue meant less spending on schools, transportation networks and other investments. He said the practice also hurts middle-class Americans because \u201cthat lost revenue has to be made up somewhere\u201d. \u201cWhen companies exploit loopholes like this it makes it harder to invest in the things that are going to keep America\u2019s economy going strong for future generations,\u201d Obama said. Under the deal Pfizer intended to re-domicile from its headquarters in New York to Ireland. Allergan moved its head office to Dublin after a reverse merger with the Irish drugmaker Actavis a year ago. The US tax inversion rules also scuppered US drugs group AbbVie\u2019s $54bn takeover of Britain\u2019s Shire in 2014. AbbVie pulled out of the agreed deal after a detailed examination of the rules, and concluded they made Shire less valuable to AbbVie. John Colley, a professor at Warwick Business School, said: \u201cThe stock market thinks that the US government is likely to be successful with this move. Several pharmaceutical deals are based on similar tax benefits. \u201cIndeed this move may well prevent recent tax inversion deals altogether. If so, US businesses will have to rely on more conventional benefits to justify their overseas merger plans. Pfizer may terminate the deal or alternatively renegotiate a lower price. Certainly their shareholders will not now be happy with the terms of the original deal.\u201d Pfizer chief executive Ian Read has made no secret of his desire to split the company into two parts, one comprising patented-protected innovative drugs and the other with older products that have come off patent or are close to it. The two drugmakers agreed either party may terminate the deal if a change in US law would cause the combined company to be treated as a domestic corporation for federal income tax purposes.",

                "bodyText":"The final scores in Europe showed some reasonable gains in the wake of the oil price rise, itself fuelled by the bigger than expected fall in US crude stocks. A boost to pharmaceutical stocks also helped matters, as investors bet that Pfizer would turn its attention to another target following the collapse of its $160bn deal to buy Allergan. The closing figures for Europe were: The FTSE 100 finished 70.40 points or 1.16% higher at 6161.63 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.64% to 9624.51 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.81% to 4284.64 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.77% to 17,240.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.13% at 8398.6 In Greece, the Athens market bucked the trend, slipping 1.27% to 554.12 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 70 points or 0.4%. On oil, Chris Beauchamp of IG said: The positive sheen on stock markets this afternoon would likely have been more of a thin veneer had it not been for a surge in oil prices thanks to the first fall in US stockpiles in two months. More of this is needed however to convert the still robust community of oil bears that expect further declines. West Texas is up 5.1% at the moment to $37.74 a barrel, while Brent crude is 5.2% higher at $39.84. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The oil price rise has energised markets which were threatening to drift in an uncertain fashion towards the close of trading. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: It\u2019s been a decent session for London\u2019s FTSE-100 with the blue chip index seeing gains accelerate into the close. A large fall in the US crude inventory data is certainly helping bolster sentiment with WTI oil lining up for another go at the $40 a barrel mark and as we keep noting this asset really does seem to be driving momentum for the market as a whole. West Texas Intermediate - the US crude benchmark - is currently up 4.8% at $37.62 while Brent crude is 4.2% better at $39.47. Back with the news that Pfizer and Allergan have called off their merger, and the collapse has been welcomed by the Democratic frontrunner in the US election: Brent crude, which was up around 1.8% before the release of the US crude figures, is now up 2.85% at $38.85 a barrel. David Morrison at Spreadco said: Crude was already in positive territory for the day with WTI and Brent climbing back above their technically-significant levels of $36 and $38 per barrel respectively. This push higher began late yesterday and bucked the downward trend that\u2019s been in place since mid-March. The sell-off over the last few weeks is a reaction to the dysfunction apparent within OPEC ahead of the planned meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to freeze output. Suggestions from Kuwait that there would be a positive announcement on a production freeze at this month\u2019s meeting was partly behind the strength in the oil price earlier in the day. Here is Reuters on the drop in US crude inventories: U.S. crude stocks unexpectedly fell from record highs last week as refineries continued to hike output and imports fell, while gasoline stocks rose, snapping a six-week decline, data from the Energy Information Administration showed on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 4.9 million barrels in the last week, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations for an increase of 3.2 million barrels.... Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 357,000 barrels, EIA said. Refinery crude runs, which have remained at record seasonal levels for most of this year thanks to unusually strong gasoline margins, rose by 199,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates rose by 1 percentage point, although usage may ebb with more maintenance expected throughout this month. Gasoline stocks, which swelled this winter to record highs and remain at unusually high levels for this time of year, rose by 1.4 million barrels after six consecutive declines, compared with expectations for a 1.0 million barrels drop. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 1.8 million barrels, versus expectations for a 333,000 barrels drop, the EIA data showed. U.S. crude imports fell last week by 446,000 barrels per day. Here is the notification on the crude move from the Energy Information Administration: A surprise weekly drop in US crude stocks has pushed oil prices even higher. It\u2019s become rather a mixed bag as far as markets are concerned, as Europe heads towards the close of trading. The FTSE 100 is holding onto its gains, up 20 points or 0.3%, but Germany\u2019s Dax is marginally in the red while France\u2019s Cac has managed to edge higher. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost its early gains and is now 49 points or 0.28% lower, ahead of the minutes of last month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Whilst the FTSE held into its oil- and pharma-inspired gains the picture was far more mixed across the rest of the market. The Dow Jones [has slipped], a lack of data and hesitation ahead of this evening\u2019s Fed meeting minutes suppressing the appetite of US investors. It will be interesting to see what is uncovered with the latest insight into the inner workings of the central bank. Reports of discord between a dovish Yellen and the FOMC\u2019s more hawkish members have only grown in the past few weeks, and investors will likely be keen to see what kind of rhetoric was used by both sides in March\u2019s meeting, especially if it helps provide an idea of when the balance might shift in favour of those supporting a rate hike. The FTSE, meanwhile, managed to outperform the rest of the major global indices... thanks to two of its key sectors. Firstly Brent Crude\u2019s $39 per barrel-pushing rebound helped to instil the semblance of stability in the oil stocks (even if their mining peers have been dragged down by a one month low-showing from copper). Secondly the likes of AstraZeneca and Shire saw unexpected growth as the day continued, the fallout from the failed Pfizer/Allergan merger causing many to speculate that the former might be go shopping again to satisfy its M&amp;A-thirst. More detail of the state of the US job market has just been issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report says: Unemployment rates were lower in February than a year earlier in 296 of the 387 metropolitan areas, higher in 76 areas, and unchanged in 15 areas, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Eleven areas had jobless rates of less than 3.0 percent and 11 areas had rates of at least 10.0 percent. Nonfarm payroll employment increased over the year in 323 metropolitan areas, decreased in 62 areas, and was unchanged in 2 areas. The national unemployment rate in February was 5.2 percent, not seasonally adjusted, down from 5.8 percent a year earlier. In its latest pronouncement ahead of its meeting next week, the International Monetary Fund has called for labour markets to be reformed to boost jobs. Larry Elliott writes: The protracted weakness of the global economy has highlighted the need for lower taxes on employment and higher public spending to get the unemployed back into work, the International Monetary Fund has said. Expressing concern about sluggish growth in the west since the 2008-09 downturn, the Washington-based IMF said it was time for ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing to be accompanied by a range of structural reforms. The IMF issued its advice in a chapter from the half-yearly World Economic Outlook (WEO) released before the report\u2019s publication next week. Romain Duval and Davide Furceri, economists from the IMF\u2019s research department, said: \u201cIn the current environment of persistent weak economic activity in many advanced economies, there is a strong case for product and labour market reforms, complemented by macroeconomic policy support, to boost jobs and growth.\u201d The chapter from the WEO said an example of product market reform would be to make it easier for new firms to break into markets such as retailing and professional services. Labour market reforms included higher public spending to help the jobless find work, cutting unemployment benefits to encourage the jobless to take low-paid work, cutting taxes on employment, and making it easier for employers to hire and fire full-time staff. The full story is here: As the oil price continues to rise, buoyed by hopes of production freezes after comments from Kuwait, US markets are edging higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up while the S&amp;P 500 is 0.09% higher and Nasdaq has added 0.17%. And after falling 15% on Tuesday on talk that its takeover by Pfizer would fall through, Allergan has recovered slightly, up 0.5% at the open. Here\u2019s our latest report on the collapse of the Pfizer and Allergan deal: The world\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical deal was called off on Wednesday when Pfizer and Allergan responded to changes in the US tax regime by abandoning their $160bn merger. In what will be regarded as a victory for the US president, Barack Obama, in his drive to clamp down on tax avoiding deals, Pfizer \u2013 best known for Viagra and its cholesterol pill Lipitor \u2013 will now pay the Botox producer Allergan $150m for pulling out of the deal. The transaction was first announced in November and is the second major deal Pfizer has attempted that has collapsed in two years after it failed to clinch a \u00a370bn takeover of the British drugmaker AstraZeneca in 2014. There was immediate speculation that Pfizer might again turn its attentions to a UK-listed company, with shares in Shire and AstraZeneca each rising by about 3% to lead the FTSE 100 higher. Both Pfizer and Allergan set out their credentials to remain standalone entities, though Pfizer\u2019s chief executive, Ian Read, said a possible division into two parts \u2013 one focused on patented-protected innovative drugs and the other on older products that have come off patent or are close to it \u2013 was still on the table. \u201cWe plan to make a decision about whether to pursue a potential separation of our innovative and established businesses by no later than the end of 2016, consistent with our original timeframe for the decision prior to the announcement of the potential Allergan transaction,\u201d Read said. The full story is here: Most of Europe\u2019s main markets are still up: The pound is down against the dollar and the euro on renewed fears over what an exit from then EU would mean for the UK economy. Sterling fell 0.6% to a near two-year low of 80.85 pence against the euro. It hit a five-week low against the dollar, down 1% at $1.4025. The pound was also down against a basket of currencies at the lowest level since December 2013. The falls came as the latest poll on the EU referendum showed 43% of voters wanted to leave, while 44% were opposed to Brexit. Peter Frank, currency strategist at BBVA: The closeness of opinion polls means that there is a large risk that Brexit could happen. This scenario risks a huge slide in sterling. Foreign direct investment and portfolio flows are needed to recycle the UK\u2019s record trade and current account deficits. A Brexit vote ... could halt such sterling supportive net capital inflows. The FTSE 100 continues to make gains on the back of the collapsed $160bn deal between Viagra-maker Pfizer and Botox-producing Allergan. The index is up 0.7% or 42 points at 6,133, with pharmaceutical companies Shire and AstraZeneca at the top of the leader board, up by 3.7% and 3.4% respectively. Investors appear to be betting that now the deal has collapsed, UK pharma companies might be back on the shopping list. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG: The possibility now is that Pfizer goes shopping again, and you might be prepared to develop a case that maybe a firm like Shire becomes the bid target. The implications of the new [US tax inversion] rules would have to be worked out, but if you\u2019ve got cash sloshing around the sector, people are wondering who will benefit. Allergan\u2019s full statement on the collapse of the Pfizer deal can be found here. The company said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the deal would no longer happen, but argued it still had a strong future as a standalone company. Brent Saunders, chief executive and president: While we are disappointed that the Pfizer transaction will no longer move forward, Allergan is poised to deliver strong, sustainable growth built on a set of powerful attributes. Leading therapeutic franchises with strong brands across seven therapeutic areas provide the foundation for continued strong growth in 2016 and beyond. Our pipeline is one of the strongest in the industry, loaded with 70 mid-to-late stage programs including 14 expected approvals and 16 regulatory submissions in 2016 alone,\u201d Pfizer has officially confirmed that it is walking away from its proposed $160bn deal with Ireland-based Allergan. It follows moves by US President Barack Obama to clamp down on so-called tax inversion deals, where companies relocate their headquarters in order to benefit from lower tax rates. Pfizer said the deal was terminated by \u201cmutual agreement\u201d. It will pay Allergan a break fee of $150m (\u00a3106m). Pfizer said it was pulling out as a result of the proposed changes in the US, which it judged to be an \u201cadverse tax law change\u201d. Ian Read, Pfizer\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said: Pfizer approached this transaction from a position of strength and viewed the potential combination as an accelerator of existing strategies. We remain focused on continuing to enhance the value of our innovative and established businesses. Our most recent product launches, including Prevnar 13 in Adults, Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz, have been well-received in the market, and we believe our late stage pipeline has several attractive commercial opportunities with high potential across several therapeutic areas. We also maintain the financial strength and flexibility to pursue attractive business development and other shareholder friendly capital allocation opportunities. We plan to make a decision about whether to pursue a potential separation of our innovative and established businesses by no later than the end of 2016, consistent with our original timeframe for the decision prior to the announcement of the potential Allergan transaction. As always, we remain committed to enhancing shareholder value. Read the full statement here. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence has published a report on what impact share price falls in the first quarter have had on the market value of Europe\u2019s top banks. HSBC held on to the top spot despite a near 19% fall in value over the first quarter. S&amp;P notes: HSBC Holdings Plc remains atop the ranking, but with its shares down nearly 19% in the first quarter, its market capitalisation expressed in terms of euros is no longer more than double that of runner-up Lloyds Banking Group Plc. Deutsche Bank AG dropped to 20th by market capitalisation from 14th three months earlier, having seen its shares fall by one-third during the first quarter. PAO Sberbank of Russia rose five spots to 12th, while Allied Irish Banks Plc returned to the top 20 by rising 11 places from 26th. KBC Group NV, Standard Chartered Plc and UniCredit SpA dropped out of the top 20 during the quarter. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP whose Aberavon constituency is home to Tata\u2019s Port Talbot plant has been speaking of his hopes that a deal can be done to save the steel plant. This from Guardian reporter Sean Farrell: Losses at Tata Steel have halved from the previously reported \u00a31m a day, giving weight to management\u2019s claims that it can turn the business around, the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said. Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency is home to Tata\u2019s Port Talbot plant, said the government should not rush into backing the wrong deal for the business,which Tata put up for sale last week. He welcomed the interest of metals magnate Sanjeev Gupta in a possible rescue plan but was doubtful about Gupta\u2019s proposal to replace Port Talbot\u2019s giant steelmaking blast furnace with an operation built around recycling scrap steel. Kinnock has been a fierce critic of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis at Tata Steel, which employs 15,000 people including about 4,000 at the Port Talbot plant in south Wales. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, arrived in Mumbai on Wednesday to meet Tata\u2019s bosses a week after Kinnock travelled to the city to lobby the Indian conglomerate when Javid was on a trip to Australia. Javid is now trying to help broker a purchase of the business, possibly with government support for the buyer. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Today programme, Kinnock said: \u201cIt\u2019s very good that Sajid Javid has finally found his way to Mumbai. The proposals Mr Gupta has outlined are very interesting indeed. I\u2019m going to be meeting with him very soon \u2026 But there are quite interesting ideas bubbling under and we need to make sure we don\u2019t rush to something because the government is in such a shambles.\u201d Read the full story here. European markets continue to rise, with the FTSE 100 up 0.5% at 6,122.42. The index of leading UK shares is being boosted by some upbeat news from China and a rebounding oil price (Brent crude oil is currently up 2.3% at $38.73 a barrel). But it is also benefitting from the expectation that Pfizer is about to walk away from its $160bn merger with Allergan. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, explains: A jump in the price of oil and surprisingly positive service sector data from China has helped lift European shares off three-week lows on Wednesday. Reports that the Allergan-Pfizer merger has been terminated has counter-intuitively sparked buying in other UK and Irish pharmaceutical groups. Speculation that Pfizer will look for another partner in its quest to relocate its headquarters and lower its tax burden has sent the shares of Shire and AstraZeneca flying. Best selling cars in the UK in March: Ford Fiesta Vauxhall Corsa Ford Focus Volkswagen Golf Nissan Qashqai Volkswagen Polo Vauxhall Astra Mini Fiat 500 Audi A3 Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, has issued a note of caution on UK new car sales, which have seemed unstoppable in recent years. He suggests consumer appetite will start to wane, with a knock-on effect for the wider economy. The key drivers of the recovery in car sales are weakening. Unsecured borrowing costs, while still falling, are not declining as sharply as they did in 2015. Meanwhile, consumer confidence has deteriorated this year and the intensification of the fiscal squeeze in the new fiscal year, which began this week, likely will depress sentiment further. Car sales contributed 0.3 percentage points to the 2.8% year-over-year rise in overall household spending in 2015, so this slowdown will be discernible in the headline consumption numbers. Phil Harrold, PwC\u2019s automotive leader, is much more upbeat: Today\u2019s figures reflect continuing business and consumer confidence, which will undoubtedly be boosted following the recent motor friendly budget that saw no changes to vehicle excise duty and fuel duty frozen for a sixth year. Business users continue to replenish fleets as more economical vehicles become available and consumers continue to access the very cheap finance deals that show no signs of abating. Of particular interest is the growth of alternatively fuelled vehicles as technology becomes more advanced but, more crucially, consumer acceptance levels rise. New car sales rose by 5.3% to 518,707 in March, boosted by the fact it was a plate change month. It was the best ever month since the bi-annual plate change was introduced in 1999, according to figures published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It rounded off a record quarter, with more than 770,000 new cars registered between January and March. That was a 5.1% increase compared with the same period in 2015. Consumers have been attracted by cheap car finance deals, as well as lower emission vehicles with lower running costs. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT welcomed the increase in sales but warned consumer confidence could be undermined \u201cby political or economic uncertainty\u201d. There is a 35-40% chance that the UK will vote to leave the EU on 23 June, according to analysts at IHS. They point out that it would take two years to actually exit following the referendum, but what is unknown is whether the process of Brexit would be \u201csoft\u201d or \u201chard\u201d. And this would have broader implications for the performance of the UK economy. The most favourable outcome to a vote for the United Kingdom to exit the European Union would be what IHS terms a \u201csoft\u201d exit. Under this scenario, the UK would conduct amicable and constructive negotiations with the EU resulting in full trade agreements and full UK access to the European Single Market. On the migration front, the UK would attract highly skilled workers, perhaps through the adoption of a points system as used by Australia. A reduction in the number of less skilled workers coming into the country would have an upward impact on UK earnings; though, this scenario would also hurt the UK\u2019s competitiveness by putting upward pressure on unit labour costs, IHS says. Under a \u201chard\u201d exit scenario, the exit could be contentious and lengthy. The UK would struggle markedly over the short and longer term and would find itself excluded from, or having limited access to, the European Single Market. With the UK having limited access to the European Single Market and struggling for trade agreements, there would be significantly lower levels of new foreign direct investment. The City of London\u2019s position would be compromised and it would lose appreciable business to Frankfurt and Paris. Finally, under this scenario, the UK\u2019s migration policy would result in a lack of incoming workers needed for lesser-skilled jobs, and the resultant reduced workforce would limit potential UK growth. More reaction on those better than expected German industrial production numbers... Jonathan Loynes, Capital Economics: February\u2019s surprisingly small fall in German industrial production offers hope of a pick-up in GDP growth in the first quarter. But it is too early to conclude that the eurozone\u2019s main growth engine is now firing on all cylinders. Overall, an encouraging set of figures, given the importance of the German industrial sector. But with other evidence still downbeat, not least on the all-important consumer sector, there is little here to point to a broader upturn either in Germany or the currency union as a whole. Carsten Brzeski, ING: Another disappointment. German industrial production posted the expected decline in February, providing further evidence that the economy\u2019s former backbone has become weak. Only the construction sector remains an almost inexhaustible source of growth. Industrial production has become a kind of problem child over the last months. Despite tentative signs of stabilisation, industrial production has stagnated for a long while. Still, there are some tender rays of hope at the end of the tunnel: the recent drop in inventories combined with a pick up in corporate loans and capacity utilization at the highest level since end-2011 suggests that it is too early, yet, to give up on the German industry. In Germany, official figures showed industrial output fell by 0.5% in February, compared with January. While that doesn\u2019t sound like great news, it was a far better result than the 1.8% drop economists polled by Reuters were expecting. Andreas Scheuerle, economist at Dekabank, said: Looking at January and February together, the picture is looking bright. Industrial production is pointing upward. But nobody should take this as a sure-fire success for the rest of the year. The problems on global sales markets are not solved yet. Scheuerle said the data pointed to German growth of 0.5% in the first quarter. The industrial output data was also a welcome relief following shockingly poor figures for industrial orders, published on Tuesday. Orders had been expected to increase by 0.2% in February, but instead fell by 1.2%. In corporate news, the largest pharmaceuticals merger in history appears to be on the rocks. It is thought the $160bn (\u00a3113bn) deal between US giant Pfizer (best known for Viagra) and Dublin based Allergan (Botox producer) could be abandoned after the US government took new steps to clamp down on tax avoidance deals. The US Treasury proposed new rules on Monday, which would make so-called tax inversion deals - where companies relocate their headquarters to countries with a lower tax rate - less financially appealing. We will bring you official confirmation once we have it. In the meantime, read our full story on events so far here. The FTSE 100 has opened up 0.4% or 22 points at 6,113. All other major European indices have also opened higher. Oil prices rose from one-month lows as traders pinned their hopes on exporters agreeing to freeze production. US crude futures jumped by more than a dollar, or almost 3%, to a high of $36.92 a barrel. Brent crude is up 1.6% at $38.48 a barrel. Business activity in China\u2019s services sector increased in March on stronger demand, according to the latest PMI survey. The Caixin China general services PMI came in at 52.2 in March, up from 51.2 in February. Anything above 50 indicates growth. That has eased fears over the outlook in China, supporting the view that the economy is stabilising. Here is what\u2019s been happening in Asia... Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets and business. Asian investors were in a brighter mood today than their counterparts in the US and Europe yesterday. The Nikkei has closed down just 0.1% at 15,715.36, while the Hang Seng was up 0.1% at 20,203.45. That compared with sharper falls in the US and Europe on Tuesday, as investors became jittery following (another) warning from the IMF about the fragile state of the global economy, and weak eurozone data. Asian investors were encouraged by an improvement in China\u2019s services sector (more to follow), and a rebound in oil prices.",

And for the euro-zone, the generally disappointing first-quarter data have supported our view that activity is likely to slow this year.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40b96d8ae631f6bfafa918fe89a239e098cc717c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40b96d8ae631f6bfafa918fe89a239e098cc717c/0_0_669_436/500.jpg\" alt=\"GDP forecasts\" width=\"500\" height=\"326\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">GDP forecasts</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Among emerging economies, we think growth in China will be around 5.5%.

A vote to leave would, it says, have serious consequences not just for Britain and its EU partners but for the whole of the global economy. The Fund is twitchy. It can identify a number of different triggers that might possibly bring about a new, dangerous phase of the crisis \u2013 such as a sharper than expected slowdown in China, a collapse in emerging markets or a pandemic. But with little more than two months to go before the referendum, Brexit is the most immediate threat.</p> <p>But if the Fund is right in its assessment, something will trigger the crisis sooner or later even if Britain decides to remain a member of the EU. The IMF says global growth has been too slow for too long, and proposes a mix of expansionary monetary policy (low interest rates and quantitative easing), higher spending on infrastructure and research and development, and structural reforms to boost productivity.</p> <p>This, though, seems a bit timid if the Fund is right in its analysis that globalisation benefits the few not the many and that a rising tide no longer lifts all boats. In that case, the remedy would not be more R&amp;D spending but checks on financial speculation and more aggressive redistribution. Global growth has indeed been too slow for too long.

Tortuous talks to complete the first review under debt-stricken Greece\u2019s third international bailout are beginning to resemble the momentum that triggered crunch time in 2015. Despite the positive face put on by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who emerged in the early hours to say that progress had been made, there is no hiding the divide that still exists between Athens and the foreign lenders keeping the country afloat.</p> <p>As the straight-talking Oxford-educated finance minister himself admitted:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cbecause there are many other small [issues] we did not have the time to discuss it became obvious to all of us that it was not possible to have a staff level agreement by day break today.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Disagreement over non performing loans and pension reforms still linger but beyond discord over Athens\u2019 ability to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % by 2018, it is the much bigger disagreement over debt relief that has come to cloud the talks. The inability of Berlin and the International Monetary Fund to see eye-to-eye on the matter is unlikely to be resolved soon.</p> <p>Even if Greek officials manage to put the final touches to a deal that would effectively conclude the process later this week at the IMF\u2019s spring meetings in Washington DC, in Athens almost no one believes in a similar breakthrough on the crucial issue of debt relief. Without debt forgiveness, few have faith in the shattered Greek economy ever recovering. While the IMF continues to advocate a debt haircut, EU member states led by Berlin have hinted that, at most, a reduction would come in the form of longer maturities and grace periods.</p> <p>In private, leading members of the leftist led government are holding out the hope that Europe\u2019s refugee emergency \u2013 and Greece\u2019s frontline role \u2013 will help cut it some slack.</p> <p>\u201cBut that line of thought could backfire in so many ways,\u201d says Aristides Hatzis, associate professor of law and economics at the University of Athens.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFirst of all from the far right that will exploit anti-immigrant sentiment while the trade off of less reforms for more refugees will, quite rightly, never be accepted by the IMF.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>If the talks aren\u2019t concluded by May, Greece, will, once again, face a ferocious liquidity problem just when it confronts \u20ac5bn worth of debt repayments in June and July (money it does not have) and the UK is gearing up for its in-out EU referendum. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YiannisMouzakis/status/719840789648375809\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a>&#39;s 2016 debt obligations <a href=\"https://t.co/uqXMoeoCr4\">pic.twitter.com/uqXMoeoCr4</a></p>&mdash; Yiannis Mouzakis (@YiannisMouzakis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YiannisMouzakis/status/719840789648375809\">April 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-12T11:33:00.264Z\">at 12.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-570cd444e4b00591e8dc8a62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-12T10:58:16.399Z\">11.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newsflash: Saudi Arabia\u2019s credit rating has just been cut by one notch, to AA-, by Fitch.</strong></p> <p>Fitch also left Saudi Arabia with a negative outlook, meaning further cuts are possible.</p> <p>It cited the \u201cnegative implications\u201d of cheaper oil on the country\u2019s fiscal stability, and also pointed to rising tensions with Iran.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/business/status/719840841905369089\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Saudi Arabia ratings cut by Fitch, which says outlook remains negative <a href=\"https://t.co/wx9kCQwAFW\">https://t.co/wx9kCQwAFW</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hdRW81pEih\">pic.twitter.com/hdRW81pEih</a></p>&mdash; Bloomberg (@business) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/business/status/719840841905369089\">April 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-570cd146e4b00591e8dc8a58\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-12T10:53:32.955Z\">11.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB's Weidmann defends Draghi</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"07d0814dc6fa3858edb9825faaa43df5d379043c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07d0814dc6fa3858edb9825faaa43df5d379043c/0_0_3500_1730/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The President of the Deutsche Bundesbank (German Central Bank) Jens Weidmann.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"494\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Has peace broken out at the European Central Bank, between president Mario Draghi and his more hawkish colleague Jens Weidmann?</strong></p> <p>Weidmann, who heads up Germany\u2019s central bank, has leapt to Draghi\u2019s defence against critics - including many Germans \u2013 who oppose his monetary easing and record low interest rates.</p> <p>Speaking to the Financial Times, Weidmann argues (persuasively) that it\u2019s too simplistic to just talk about \u2018savers\u2019 suffering from low borrowing costs.

However, the UK economy is battling a number of significant headwinds at present. Consumer spending, aided by low inflation, low unemployment and rising wages, has been the engine of economic growth lately.

Fares rose by 2.7% between the same 2 months in 2015.</p> <p>There was also a smaller upward effect from rail passenger transport with fares rising this year but falling a year ago. These upward effects were partially offset by a downward contribution from motor fuels with petrol prices rising by 0.9 pence per litre this year compared with a larger rise of 3.8 pence per litre a year ago.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Clothing and footwear: </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>prices, overall, rose by 1.0% between February and March this year compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. Last year was the first time that prices had fallen between February and March since the CPI started in 1996. Normally they rise as they continue to recover following the January sales period. The upward contribution this year came from price movements across a range of women\u2019s outerwear.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Restaurants and hotels: </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>prices, overall, rose by 0.5% between February and March 2016 compared with a rise of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago.

                "bodyText":"A jump in the oil price has fuelled a rise in European markets, which had previously been looking rather uncertain. Hopes of an agreement at the imminent meeting of oil producers in Doha, specifically suggestions that Russia and Saudi Arabia had agreed a freeze, sent crude prices to new highs for the year. Brent is currently 3.7% higher at $44.43 a barrel, having touched $44.73, while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is up 3.1% at $41.61. Oil has also been lifted by the weakness in the dollar, as investors bet there would not be an imminent rise in US interest rates. Meanwhile, optimism that the Chinese economy may be stabilising helped other commodities and pushed mining shares higher. The gloomy news from the International Monetary Fund, which cut its global growth forecasts, was pushed to one side. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 42.27 points or 0.68% at 6242.39 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.81% to 9761.47 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.77% to 4345.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.57% higher at 8546.3 But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB bucked the trend, falling 1.57% to 17,444.80 as the country\u2019s banks slipped back after recent gains on confirmation of a plan to restructure bad loans In Greece, the Athens market dipped 1.34% to 553.43 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 157 points or 0.9% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The IMF\u2019s growth forecasts still look too optimistic even though they have been downgraded, says Capital Economics: Despite being revised down yet again, we think the IMF\u2019s latest projections for global growth are still too high. This is partly because the IMF appears to be constrained by the official, government forecasts for China and India, but its projections for the US and the euro-zone also look too optimistic. Among advanced economies, the key differences [between the IMF and our forecasts] are that we are less optimistic about both the US and the euro-zone. With first-quarter growth in the US now likely to be only around 1.0%, the risks to our US forecast are to the downside. And for the euro-zone, the generally disappointing first-quarter data have supported our view that activity is likely to slow this year. Among emerging economies, we think growth in China will be around 5.5%. Note that although this is lower than official and IMF estimates, it would be an improvement compared to last year. For India, too, the difference between our projections and those of the IMF is partly due to uncertainty surrounding the official national accounts data. Finally, although Brazil and Russia\u2019s recessions both look set to continue this year, we expect them to be slightly less severe than is projected by the IMF. (A reminder that there were hopes of an agreement over the weekend.) More on the Greek situation: Oil prices were always going to be influenced by reports ahead of the producers\u2019 meeting, said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, but in practice, any output freeze at January levels may not bring the benefits expected. He said: Rumours of a deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia for a production freeze provided further gains for crude today amid a four-month high for Brent. This week was always likely to see market positioning in advance of the meeting, which has driven substantial gains across the energy sector. However, given that many of the world producers are pumping less than they did in January, a freeze could even increase the amount of crude being produced. Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has said that two bills on pensions and taxes - sticking points in the discussions with the country\u2019s creditors - will be presented to parliament next week, Reuters in reporting. And - something to look forward to - he has also suggested there may be an extra Eurogroup meeting on 25 or 26 April. Earlier senior German government officials told Reuters that there could be no decision on any debt measures for Greece until the bailout review has been completed. The oil price increase is giving some support to stock markets, with the FTSE 100, Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac all climbing around 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 110 points or 0.6%. The positive moves come despite the gloomy noises coming from the International Monetary Fund which has cut its global growth forecasts again. Oil continues to strengthen, now helped by another report that key producers might agree a deal to tackle the supply glut, this time from news agency Interfax: Here\u2019s Reuters on the IMF\u2019s latest comments on Greece: The International Monetary Fund\u2019s chief economist said on Tuesday that Europe will need to show some flexibility towards Greece as it deals with a refugee crisis and negotiates a new bailout package. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly going to be a need for more flexibility to tackle the refugee crisis and some support from the broader European community,\u201d IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said in a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s a European problem, it\u2019s actually a global problem.\u201d He said the IMF has during its negotiations with Athens called for some debt relief, coupled with fiscal adjustments by the Greek government that would put the country on a path towards debt sustainability. The talks are on hold for the IMF-World Bank spring meetings this week in Washington. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking a stand on each particular component. But we need a program that adds up,\u201d Obstfeld said. Here\u2019s a list of the recent Brexit polls: After its earlier strength on the back of higher than expected UK inflation figures, sterling has now fallen back as a new survey shows the campaign for Britain to leave the EU is in the lead. The pound is down almost half a cent to $1.431 as an ICM poll put leave on 45% and remain on 42%. The European Commission has now unveiled its tax proposals for large corporations. Jennifer Rankin writes: Multinational companies will be forced to disclose profits earned and taxes paid in Europe and the world\u2019s shadiest fiscal havens, under proposals announced on Tuesday by EU regulators. The European commission wants all large companies to publish a country-by-country breakdown of profits, taxes, employees and turnover in all 28 member states of the EU, as well as some of the most problematic tax havens. American and Chinese companies with a subsidiary in Europe would also be subject to the transparency drive, as the rules would hit all global corporations with a large presence in Europe. If agreed, the new disclosure requirements would shine a spotlight on some of the world\u2019s most powerful companies, including Apple, Google and Starbucks, which have been caught up in a public furore over their tax bills. Lord Hill, the European commissioner for financial services, said the new rules would give the public \u201ca clear idea of whether a large multinational is paying tax where they make their profits\u201d. The proposals would be good for competition, he said, by levelling the playing field between large corporations and smaller firms. \u201cBy using complicated tax arrangements, some multinationals can pay nearly a third less tax than companies that only operate in one country.\u201d The full story is here: The US should wait until inflation is stronger before raising rates, according to Philadelphia Federal Reserve president Patrick Harker. And negative interest rates, although legally and technically difficult, should not be taken off the table, he said, echoing comments earlier this year from Fed chair Janet Yellen. Harker told a local business group: Although I remain confident that inflation will return to the Committee\u2019s 2 percent target, my outlook sees it doing so only gradually... global headwinds point to some downside risks to my economic outlook. These considerations make me a bit more conservative in my approach to policy, at least in the very near term. Although I cannot give you a definitive path for how policy will evolve, it might prove prudent to wait until the inflation data are stronger before we undertake a second rate hike. So, I am approaching near-term policy more cautiously than I did a few months ago. That is part of being data dependent. And attentiveness to the data will be a key factor in all of my future policy recommendations as well. If financial headwinds dissipate quickly and inflation picks up a bit more aggressively, it will require a slightly more aggressive approach to policy. [But] it will take fewer rate hikes to attain neutrality in policy than it would have 15 years ago. By historical standards, that in itself implies a somewhat shallower path for interest rates than was typical of past recoveries. The IMF\u2019s economic counsellor Maurice Obstfeld has said there is a need for more flexibility between Europe and Greece to handle the refugee crisis and the debt situation. Bruce Springsteen, Paypal and now Deutsche Bank. The bank has added its name to the list of those protesting a controversial anti-LGBT law in North Carolina. It has frozen plans to create 250 new jobs at its Cary, North Carolina, operation after the state became the first in the US to enact legislation requiring people to use public bathrooms or locker rooms that match the gender on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity. John Cryan, co-chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank, said: \u201cWe take our commitment to building inclusive work environments seriously. We\u2019re proud of our operations and employees in Cary and regret that as a result of this legislation we are unwilling to include North Carolina in our US expansion plans for now. We very much hope that we can re-visit our plans to grow this location in the near future.\u201d The bank currently employs 900 people at Cary and said it was \u201ccommitted to sustaining that existing presence.\u201d Last week Springsteen cancelled a concert in North Carolina because of the new law, which critics say legalises discrimination. Bank of America and American Airlines, which are based in Charlotte, have condemned the law, while PayPal cancelled plans to open a new operation center in Charlotte. The IMF is worried about a new phase of the financial crisis, but its proposals to remedy the situation do not go far enough, writes Larry Elliott: The prospect of Brexit clearly scares the IMF. A vote to leave would, it says, have serious consequences not just for Britain and its EU partners but for the whole of the global economy. The Fund is twitchy. It can identify a number of different triggers that might possibly bring about a new, dangerous phase of the crisis \u2013 such as a sharper than expected slowdown in China, a collapse in emerging markets or a pandemic. But with little more than two months to go before the referendum, Brexit is the most immediate threat. But if the Fund is right in its assessment, something will trigger the crisis sooner or later even if Britain decides to remain a member of the EU. The IMF says global growth has been too slow for too long, and proposes a mix of expansionary monetary policy (low interest rates and quantitative easing), higher spending on infrastructure and research and development, and structural reforms to boost productivity. This, though, seems a bit timid if the Fund is right in its analysis that globalisation benefits the few not the many and that a rising tide no longer lifts all boats. In that case, the remedy would not be more R&amp;D spending but checks on financial speculation and more aggressive redistribution. Global growth has indeed been too slow for too long. The Fund\u2019s remedy is too little too late. His full analysis is here: Ahead of its spring meeting the International Monetary Fund has, as expected, cut its forecasts for global growth, at the same time as warning on the risks of Britain leaving the European Union. Katie Allen and Anushka Asthana write: A British vote to leave the EU risks causing severe economic and political damage to Europe that will spill over into an already febrile world economy, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Cutting its forecasts for global growth and for the UK and other advanced economies, the IMF listed a potential Brexit vote in June\u2019s EU referendum as a key risk in its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO)... The IMF now predicts global GDP growth will edge up only slightly this year, to 3.2%, from growth of 3.1% in 2015. That compared with a 2016 forecast of 3.4% in a January update and of 3.6% in the last WEO in October. The 2017 forecast was cut to 3.5% from, 3.6% in January... The IMF cut its forecast for UK GDP growth this year. After growing 2.2% in 2015, the economy was now expected to expand 1.9% in 2016, down from a forecast of 2.2% made by the Fund in January. That compares with 2.0% growth predicted for 2016 by the government\u2019s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility. The IMF left its forecast for 2017 growth unchanged at 2.2%. The full story is here: US import prices rose in March by 0.2% after a revised 0.4% drop in the previous month. The increase came following a rise in the cost of petroleum products, but it was less than the 1% expected by analysts. Brent crude has climbed above $43 a barrel on hopes that next week\u2019s meeting of oil producers can agree to freeze output to tackle the current supply glut. Iraqi oil official Falah Alamri said he was confident that the meeting with Opec and other producers in Doha would reach an agreement. Oil is also being supported by hopes that the Chinese economy is stabilising after a rise in vehicle sales. On top of that, the weak dollar is helping commodities. The gap between UK inflation and average earnings is narrowing: MPs are about to start an emergency debate on the crisis in the UK steel industry. My colleague Andrew Sparrow will be following proceedings in the politics live blog: The dollar has fallen to an eight month low against a basket of currencies as investors continue to bet that the Federal Reserve is in no hurry to raise US interest rates. Meanwhile sterling has climbed to its highest level in more than a week after the higher than expected UK inflation figures. The pound is up around half a percent at $1.4313 after the data, which suggested that UK rates could rise more quickly than people had been expecting. Greece\u2019s inability to wrap up negotiations with creditors last night has fuelled fears that the talks could drag on until the early summer, potentially coinciding with Britain\u2019s referendum on EU membership. Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, reports: Another deadline marked; another deadline missed. Tortuous talks to complete the first review under debt-stricken Greece\u2019s third international bailout are beginning to resemble the momentum that triggered crunch time in 2015. Despite the positive face put on by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who emerged in the early hours to say that progress had been made, there is no hiding the divide that still exists between Athens and the foreign lenders keeping the country afloat. As the straight-talking Oxford-educated finance minister himself admitted: \u201cbecause there are many other small [issues] we did not have the time to discuss it became obvious to all of us that it was not possible to have a staff level agreement by day break today.\u201d Disagreement over non performing loans and pension reforms still linger but beyond discord over Athens\u2019 ability to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % by 2018, it is the much bigger disagreement over debt relief that has come to cloud the talks. The inability of Berlin and the International Monetary Fund to see eye-to-eye on the matter is unlikely to be resolved soon. Even if Greek officials manage to put the final touches to a deal that would effectively conclude the process later this week at the IMF\u2019s spring meetings in Washington DC, in Athens almost no one believes in a similar breakthrough on the crucial issue of debt relief. Without debt forgiveness, few have faith in the shattered Greek economy ever recovering. While the IMF continues to advocate a debt haircut, EU member states led by Berlin have hinted that, at most, a reduction would come in the form of longer maturities and grace periods. In private, leading members of the leftist led government are holding out the hope that Europe\u2019s refugee emergency \u2013 and Greece\u2019s frontline role \u2013 will help cut it some slack. \u201cBut that line of thought could backfire in so many ways,\u201d says Aristides Hatzis, associate professor of law and economics at the University of Athens. \u201cFirst of all from the far right that will exploit anti-immigrant sentiment while the trade off of less reforms for more refugees will, quite rightly, never be accepted by the IMF.\u201d If the talks aren\u2019t concluded by May, Greece, will, once again, face a ferocious liquidity problem just when it confronts \u20ac5bn worth of debt repayments in June and July (money it does not have) and the UK is gearing up for its in-out EU referendum. Newsflash: Saudi Arabia\u2019s credit rating has just been cut by one notch, to AA-, by Fitch. Fitch also left Saudi Arabia with a negative outlook, meaning further cuts are possible. It cited the \u201cnegative implications\u201d of cheaper oil on the country\u2019s fiscal stability, and also pointed to rising tensions with Iran. Has peace broken out at the European Central Bank, between president Mario Draghi and his more hawkish colleague Jens Weidmann? Weidmann, who heads up Germany\u2019s central bank, has leapt to Draghi\u2019s defence against critics - including many Germans \u2013 who oppose his monetary easing and record low interest rates. Speaking to the Financial Times, Weidmann argues (persuasively) that it\u2019s too simplistic to just talk about \u2018savers\u2019 suffering from low borrowing costs. Employees, taxpayers, and anyone with debts are benefitting from the current situation. Weidmann is understood to have opposed some of Draghi\u2019s attempts to stimulate growth and inflation in the euro area. But he\u2019s adamant that politicians should keep their noses out: \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for politicians to have opinions on monetary policy, but we are independent,\u201d \u201cThe ECB has to deliver on its price stability mandate and thus an expansionary monetary policy stance is appropriate at this juncture regardless of different views about specific measures.\u201d More here: Bundesbank\u2019s Weidmann rebukes Draghi critics in Berlin This might ruffle some feathers in Berlin. Last Friday, German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble blamed Draghi for the rise of the eurosceptic AfD party, and declared that central banks should raise interest rates..... British house continue to outpace both the headline inflation rate and average earnings. New figures show that UK house prices increased by 7.6% in the year to February 2016. That\u2019s down from 7.9% in the year to January 2016: Once again, strong demand in London (+9.7%) and the South East (+11.4%) drove the market, while other regions were more subdued. House price annual inflation was 8.2% in England, 2.8% in Wales, -0.8% in Scotland and 2.4% in Northern Ireland. Here\u2019s our news story about the rise in UK inflation in March: The recent weakness in the pound, which has fallen 6% since last October, has also pushed inflation higher (by driving up the cost of imports). Dimitris Hiotis, partner at pricing experts Simon-Kucher &amp; Partner, reckons this trend could continue ahead of June\u2019s EU referendum. With the judgement day on Brexit looming, the sterling has continued to depreciate in recent months, which has increased the cost of imports to the country. As we move closer to the referendum on June 23rd, and with the latest polls showing it to be a close run race, we expect sterling to depreciate further and therefore cause additional inflationary pressures in the coming months. The Institute of Directors (whose members largely oppose Brexit) agrees. IoD chief economist Michael Martins argues: \u201cThe slight rise in inflation is likely connected to depreciation of the pound as uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum increases and international investors begin to sell off sterling. This is not a one-month phenomenon \u2013 core inflation, which strips out volatile factors like energy and food, increased to 1.5% in March, after averaging 1.1% over the last 8 months. \u201cWhile the Bank of England has been keen to see prices rising as a spur to economic growth, if pay rises do not shadow increased inflation, real wages will decline, putting pressure on people\u2019s wallets and holding back increases in productivity. Real wage increases are now under 2% (1.9%), running just ahead of core inflation. This rise in inflation doesn\u2019t mean that the UK economy is healed, argues TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady: \u201cDespite a small rise, the overall picture is still of very low inflation. It indicates that the economy is still not at full strength, with too much underemployment and too little wage growth. \u201cWith the global economy slowing down, the government cannot just sit by. We need investment in skills, infrastructure and public services to promote growth for the long term.\u201d Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), has urged the Bank of England to resist any temptation to raise interest rates at this week\u2019s meeting. He reckons his members have enough on their collective plates: \u201cSmall firms are currently dealing with a raft of challenges, including the National Living Wage which came into effect this month, driving up costs and driving down modest profit. A recent FSB survey showed small business confidence hovering at its lowest level since 2013. Despite inflation edging up last month, our members welcome this ongoing period of low inflation which has helped to keep other operating costs manageable. Economists are split over when the Bank of England might take the plunge and raise interest rates, now that inflation is creeping towards its 2% target. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, reckons the BoE is \u201cmiles away from raising rates\u201d, given the state of the UK economy. Stewart argues: The Bank\u2019s big problem is sustaining growth and getting inflation up. \u201cInflation may have bottomed, but the mounting risks in the global economy, and the continued risk of deflation, means that interest rates are likely to stay on hold until next year.\u201d But Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg reckons the first hike could come in November - unless Britain votes to leave the EU, of course. Looking ahead, we expect the headline rate to increase to 1.6% by the final quarter of the year. Beyond the modest dent to GDP growth in the first half of this year as a result of the financial market rout and Brexit uncertainty, underlying fundamentals point to robust growth at around trend (0.5% qoq) in the second half of the year driven by strong consumer spending and recovering business investment. The on-going acceleration in inflation, alongside consumer credit growth at a decade high, household saving at a historic low and the labour market at full employment begs the question if near-zero rates are still appropriate. Indeed, data for household spending, borrowing and saving point to some overheating in the domestic economy. Therefore, as long as the UK votes to stay in the EU we expect the Bank of England to hike rates by 25 bps in November. We see a 35% chance of a Brexit. Confused about how inflation is calculated? Or wondering why some economists have been fretting about deflation? Our video explainer has the answers... You can see the inflation report here, on the Office for National Statistics website. Today\u2019s rise in inflation may undermine the notion that UK interest rates could stay on hold until 2020. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics certainly thinks so, saying: Inflation pressures are continuing to build, challenging the consensus view in the markets that the MPC will leave interest rates on hold until the end of the decade. The rise in the headline rate entirely reflected an increase in core inflation to 1.5%, from 1.2% in February. About half this increase came from airfares, the rest from stronger inflation in the clothing and restaurant sectors. Airfares were reportedly boosted by Easter in late March, but we have our doubts that all of their rise is temporary. Ben Brettell, senior economist at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown, also believes the Bank of England will sit tight at this week\u2019s monetary policy meeting. Naturally policymakers will need to remain mindful of the risk that inflation overshoots at some point. However, the UK economy is battling a number of significant headwinds at present. Consumer spending, aided by low inflation, low unemployment and rising wages, has been the engine of economic growth lately. But recent surveys suggest consumers reined in their spending in March - perhaps the first sign of nerves ahead of June\u2019s EU referendum. All in all, the economic picture remains highly uncertain and I expect no action from Threadneedle Street for some time yet. Britain\u2019s inflation rate is still far too low to prompt an interest rate rise, says Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International: Today\u2019s increase is unlikely to spur the Bank of England into considering raising interest rates on Thursday with widespread consensus that this week will see the 85th consecutive month that the bank keeps interest rates on hold at their emergency level of 0.50%. Bloomberg columnist Mark Gilbert is struck by the surge in air fares last month. Here\u2019s some details from today\u2019s UK inflation report: Transport: prices, overall, rose by 1.7% between February and March this year compared with a rise of 0.7% between the same 2 months a year ago. By far the largest upward effect came from air transport where the timing of Easter contributed to fares rising by 22.9% between February and March 2016. Fares rose by 2.7% between the same 2 months in 2015. There was also a smaller upward effect from rail passenger transport with fares rising this year but falling a year ago. These upward effects were partially offset by a downward contribution from motor fuels with petrol prices rising by 0.9 pence per litre this year compared with a larger rise of 3.8 pence per litre a year ago. Clothing and footwear: prices, overall, rose by 1.0% between February and March this year compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. Last year was the first time that prices had fallen between February and March since the CPI started in 1996. Normally they rise as they continue to recover following the January sales period. The upward contribution this year came from price movements across a range of women\u2019s outerwear. Restaurants and hotels: prices, overall, rose by 0.5% between February and March 2016 compared with a rise of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward effect came principally from restaurant and caf\u00e9 prices rising by more than a year ago. After falling into negative territory last year, Britain\u2019s inflation rate has now moved towards the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target: And this chart confirms that higher air fares cancelled out the impact of cheaper fuel. The pound has jumped by over half a cent against the US dollar, to around $1.43. Traders are calculating that higher-than-expected inflation figures could mean UK interest rates rise earlier than expected. Britain\u2019s core inflation rate, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, has hit 1.5%. That\u2019s the highest rate since October 2014, indicating that inflationary pressures are building. The early Easter holiday has helped to push inflation up. Holiday air fares rose in March compared to 2015 (when Easter was later). This is the highest UK inflation rate since December 2014, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index anyway. Breaking: Britain\u2019s annual inflation rate has jumped to 0.5% for March, up from 0.3% in February. That beats forecasts of a smaller rise, to 0.4%. More to follow..... The IMF has already cut its forecasts for growth this year several times, as RBS\u2019s economist team point out. Today\u2019s World Economic Outlook, due at 2pm BST, may include further gloom. Hopes that Greece and its creditors could make a breakthrough have been dashed overnight, probably to no-one\u2019s great surprise. Talks between the two sides were adjourned early this morning, and will resume next week once the IMF\u2019s Spring Meeting has concluded. Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters that: \u201cThe Greek government and the four institutions agreed there was progress,\u201d But clearly not enough progress to allow the first review of Greece\u2019s bailout to be wrapped up. There are still significant differences between the two sides, on issues such as pension reform and how to tackle bad loans. Tsakalotos says they\u2019re hoping for a deal by April 22nd. Endless talks. Delays. Postponements. It\u2019s all sounding a bit 2015.... Tax avoidance by multinational corporations will be forced into the open under proposals to be unveiled by European regulators later today following the Panama Papers revelations. The European commission will put forward legislation requiring large multinationals operating in Europe to disclose where they make profits and where they pay tax on a country by country basis. Companies trading in Europe, including large subsidiaries of non-European businesses, would also have to publish how much tax they pay outside the EU with specific information about tax paid in problematic jurisdictions..... Here\u2019s the full story: Shares in luxury goods makers are sliding across Europe this morning, following disappointing results from France\u2019s LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE. Last night, LVMH warned that last November\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris had hit sales in the last quarter. It reported a 4% rise in sales to \u20ac8.62bn; analysts had expected \u20ac8.73bn. LVMH, which owns champagne house Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon and cognac label Hennessy, as well as Louis Vuitton, told shareholders: \u201cThe U.S. market is strong and Europe remains well oriented except for France which is affected by a fall in tourism.\u201d LVMH\u2019s shares have fallen by 3.5% this morning, while Hermes has lost 1.5% and Burberry has shed 1.7%. Troubled UK supermarket chain Tesco has cut back one of its overseas ventures, as it looks to bolster its position back home. Tesco has sold an 8.6% stake in southeast Asian online retailer Lazada to China\u2019s Alibaba Group, raising just over \u00a390m (and giving Alibaba a controlling stake). That could give CEO Dave Lewis a little more firepower for price cuts, in his battle against discount supermarkets. The City isn\u2019t too impressed, though - Tesco\u2019s shares are down 1.6%. London\u2019s stock market has opened cautiously, with the FTSE 100 index dropping by 8 points in early trading. Mining shares are up, partly helped by the weaker dollar. But retailers are falling after a new survey showed that sales fell last month, as wet weather put shoppers off. Jack Lew, the US treasury secretary, has turned the tables on the International Monetary Fund by arguing that it must do more to help the global economy recover. Lew called out the IMF in a speech last night, saying it must be \u2018modernised\u2019. He urged it to: ...intensify scrutiny of critical issues like exchange rates, current account imbalances, and shortfalls in global aggregate demand In other words, he wants the Fund to criticise countries who fuel currency wars or destabilise the global economy by running large trade deficits [such as Britain] or surpluses [Germany, perhaps]. Quite a challenge to the IMF, which likes to use its Spring Meetings to tell everyone else whet they\u2019re doing wrong. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has poured cold water on hopes that a global tax authority could be introduced, to combat tax evasion. Speaking in Washington overnight, she warned that the idea of an intergovernmental UN tax body \u2013 promoted by Oxfam \u2013 faced major obstacles from governments. Lagarde argues: \u201cWe need to be aware of the massive hurdles and obstacles along the way because taxation for the last century or so has been defined, conceptualised, designed, implemented on a purely territorial sovereign basis. And if anything, levying taxation is considered as an attribute of sovereignty, and anything that takes away from that is going to be very strongly opposed by many countries in the world, many forces.\u201d Having said that, Lagarde concedes that the current situation really won\u2019t do. \u201cI think it\u2019s an area where we all have to think outside the box because there are too many boxes in that tax field and thinking outside the box might be of great interest.\u201d More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s an important week for the global economy, as policymakers head to Washington for the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The IMF will be setting the scene today, with its latest World Economic Outlook (at 2pm London time) \u2013 and it\u2019s likely to warn that economic conditions have weakened again. Economists expect the Fund to downgrade its growth forecasts, along with another warning that governments must do more to improve economic conditions. We also get the latest UK inflation figures at 9.30am BST. Inflation remains a rare and illusive beast in advanced economies, but analysts reckon the UK consumer prices index could rise to 0.4%, from 0.3%. A stronger reading might give the pound a lift. We\u2019ll also be watching Italy, where the government has just hammered out a \u20ac5bn fund to support its weaker banks. It also committed to improving bankruptcy rules, to make it quicker and easier to resolve a failing business. Officials are hoping that the plan will ease concerns over the stability of the Italian banking sector, following sharp declines in bank shares recently. And tax is also on the agenda. The European Commission is expected to announce plans to force multinational companies in Europe to reveal all their profits, and tax bills, filed in offshore havens. The plan, which has been in the works for months, has been given renewed impetus by the recent Panama Papers revelations. Here\u2019s a preview:",

But, says Capital Economics:</p> <blockquote> <p>There have not been any game-changers in the fundamentals of the oil market itself. Admittedly, US oil production has started to fall. But the declines are small. US oil output was down by about 1.7% year on year in February. What\u2019s more, both the key pillars which have underpinned the recent rally could quickly unwind.</p> <p>Indeed, there is no guarantee of a deal at the weekend. Saudi Arabia has said that it will not participate in a production freeze unless Iran agrees to join as well and Iran has steadfastly committed to increasing its output to pre-sanctions levels. As it happens, we think some sort of compromise agreement is still likely, even without Iran\u2019s full participation. But given that very few of the countries attending the meeting on Sunday have either the capacity or intention to increase output anyway, freezing production at the current very high level should at best put a floor under prices. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-13T15:55:45.669Z\">at 4.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-570e5b62e4b05f26af2e112f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-13T14:48:24.631Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oil prices have slipped further after a much bigger than expected rise in weekly crude inventories, but still remain well above $40 a barrel.

This did not happen. Indeed, the headline fell by 0.3% month on month, much worse than the 0.1% increase expected, and core figures were also weak, with the control group for sales which strips out most of the volatile components, rising only 0.1% month on month.</p> <p>Moreover, when you take into account that these figures are dollar amounts, and not adjusted for inflation, which most likely rose in March as a result of higher energy prices (data released tomorrow), then it looks as if real consumer spending will barely register 1.0% growth in the first quarter of 2016, and real GDP for the same period will be equally soft.</p> <p>All of which makes it seem highly unlikely that the April FOMC meeting will deliver a further rate hike on top of the December 15 hike. Indeed, some expectations that the April meeting might be used to flag a possible June hike also look stretched following this and other recent soft activity data.

This is a substantial extra buffer. No wonder officials in Brussels, European Central Bank head Mario Draghi and the UK\u2019s regulator, the Bank of England, feel confident a taxpayer bailout will never again be required.</p> <p>So it might seem odd that the International Monetary Fund has sounded a warning in its latest financial stability report about the parlous state of the European banking system...</p> <p>But the IMF is not talking so much about the UK as Italy and other countries in the eurozone periphery. Italy has propped up a forlorn bunch of regional banks that have done little to tackle loans that will never be repaid. Zombie businesses that spend all their spare cash on interest payments, denying them the funds for investment, litter the Italian manufacturing sector, which remains vast...</p> <p>It is estimated that bad loans in Italy account for more than a third of the \u20ac900bn total, which means that a \u20ac6bn rescue fund put forward by Rome is desperately inadequate.</p> <p>So the IMF is less interested in the aggregate figures for European bank funding and more concerned about the weakest link, which experience tells us can set off a chain reaction, bringing good banks down with the bad.

                "bodyText":"Better than expected Chinese trade data which prompted hopes the world\u2019s second largest economy was beginning to stabilise set the tone for a positive day for investors. A rise in US crude inventories, which contributed to a 1% fall in oil prices, did not dampen the mood, while better than expected results from US bank JP Morgan gave further support to the market. Weak US retail sales also helped, dampening fears of an immediate rise in US interest rates. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 jumped 120.5 points or 1.93% to 6362.89, its highest level since 2 December last year Germany\u2019s Dax rose 2.71% to 10,026.10 France\u2019s Cac closed up 3.32% at 4490.31 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 4.13% to 18,165.59 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 3.21% higher at 8820.7 In Greece, though, the Athens market dipped 0.83% to 548.83 on continuing concerns about an agreement between the country and its creditors on its bailout On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 150 points or 0.85%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. It is not just oil which is giving the market a lift. Joshua Mahony at IG said: Confidence is coursing through the veins of financial markets today, as the worries seen at the turn of the year disappear into the rear view mirror. If yesterday was all about oil, today\u2019s big mover was the US dollar which finally found a buyer after over two weeks of selling. European and US stock markets are clearly in a jubilant mood, with buyers remaining in control since the opening bell. The relative disregard from US markets at the release of the joint worst retail sales figure in over a year, spells out the buoyant mood of markets today. The Bank of Canada maintained its headline interest rates steady today, in line with expectations. Certainly there will be significant relief at the BoC at the recent revival in crude prices, which will help ease the burden of monetary policy. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has reached its highest closing level since 2 December. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: There can be little doubting the fact that London\u2019s FTSE-100 has posted a solid day of gains during Wednesday\u2019s session, realising its first triple digit gain in a month and finding intra-day highs not seen since early December 2015. Commodity prices continue to march higher and that is very much dictating the pace for the markets \u2013 the Dow Jones non-ferrous metals index is up another 6% already and the miners are scattered across the top of the board, but once again Standard Chartered is worthy of note. The bank\u2019s exposure to commodity traders has been something of a millstone, but as underlying prices rally, the stock is back in vogue and today\u2019s 10% gain is certainly impressive. The recent strength of the oil price - today\u2019s fall notwithstanding - has been based mainly on hopes that the weekend\u2019s producer meeting will agree a freeze, along with signs of a slowdown in US output. But, says Capital Economics: There have not been any game-changers in the fundamentals of the oil market itself. Admittedly, US oil production has started to fall. But the declines are small. US oil output was down by about 1.7% year on year in February. What\u2019s more, both the key pillars which have underpinned the recent rally could quickly unwind. Indeed, there is no guarantee of a deal at the weekend. Saudi Arabia has said that it will not participate in a production freeze unless Iran agrees to join as well and Iran has steadfastly committed to increasing its output to pre-sanctions levels. As it happens, we think some sort of compromise agreement is still likely, even without Iran\u2019s full participation. But given that very few of the countries attending the meeting on Sunday have either the capacity or intention to increase output anyway, freezing production at the current very high level should at best put a floor under prices. Oil prices have slipped further after a much bigger than expected rise in weekly crude inventories, but still remain well above $40 a barrel. Brent crude is currently down 1.6% at $43.96. Distillate stocks also rose by more than forecast: But gasoline inventories fell back: The enthusiasm for the Chinese export figures has outweighed a host of bad news for stock markets, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: The reasons to abandon the day\u2019s super-surge began to stack up this afternoon, yet the markets remained resolute in their Chinese export-inspired jubilance as the day continued. First Opec cut its demand forecasts for 2016, slashing estimates by 50000 barrels a day with the potential for more revisions to come. Then there was yet another poll outlining the damage that would be dealt in the case of a Brexit, news that was swiftly followed by the announcement of falling retail sales in the US. Adding to the mounting bad news was a report from Reuters stating that US regulators believe JP Morgan (which rose by 3.5%% this Wednesday after revealing a better than expected first quarter loss), Bank of New York Mellon, Bank of America, State Street and Wells Fargo do not have sufficient \u2018living wills\u2019 in place to deal with another financial crisis. Along similar lines the IMF warned that the European banking sector (namely those institutions found in Greece, Italy and Portugal) would be unable to deal with a repeat of the 2008/09 recession, stating that \u2018a more complete solution to the [region\u2019s] banks\u2019 problems cannot be further postponed\u2019. Yet despite this string of scary dispatches from around the world the global indices were in remarkable good health this afternoon. The Dow Jones, boosted by the growth from JP Morgan, edged up 130 points, hitting 17850 and fresh 2016 highs in the process; the FTSE, meanwhile, climbed 120 points to 6360, enjoying the freedom given to it by its China-inspired breakout. Over in the Eurozone the Dax, perhaps intimidated by that looming 10000 mark, slightly underperformed its regional peers, the German index settling for a 2.3% rise compared to the more explosive 3% growth seen by the Cac. The US market has followed other global markets higher after the positive Chinese export data, better than expected results from JP Morgan and the oil price holding onto much of its recent gains. The weak US retail sales have also helped sentiment, suggesting that the Federal Reserve may be reluctant to raise interest rates again in the near future after December\u2019s increase. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 122 points or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 is 0,6% higher and Nasdaq has added 1%. European markets have seen their gains accelerate, with the FTSE 100 up 1.7% to its highest level since early December, while Germany\u2019s Dax is 2% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 2.7%. More on the weaker than expected US retail sales. Rob Carnell of ING said: Even when you take some upward revisions into account for February, this is yet another soft retail sales release, and makes an April rate hike look far-fetched. Consensus was hoping that despite the likelihood that the headline retail sales figure would be depressed by very weak auto sales in March, rising gasoline prices would provide some offset at the headline level, and a pick up in underlying sales would prop up the core figures. This did not happen. Indeed, the headline fell by 0.3% month on month, much worse than the 0.1% increase expected, and core figures were also weak, with the control group for sales which strips out most of the volatile components, rising only 0.1% month on month. Moreover, when you take into account that these figures are dollar amounts, and not adjusted for inflation, which most likely rose in March as a result of higher energy prices (data released tomorrow), then it looks as if real consumer spending will barely register 1.0% growth in the first quarter of 2016, and real GDP for the same period will be equally soft. All of which makes it seem highly unlikely that the April FOMC meeting will deliver a further rate hike on top of the December 15 hike. Indeed, some expectations that the April meeting might be used to flag a possible June hike also look stretched following this and other recent soft activity data. We expect some softening in the rhetoric of Federal Reserve speakers in advance of this month\u2019s meeting, so a \u201cno change\u201d will not be a surprise for markets. The IMF\u2019s warning on the state of the European banking system is directed at countries on the periphery of the eurozone, and Italy in particular, writes Phillip Inman: Total losses attributed to European banks in the last financial crash were around \u20ac1tn, so a repeat of the devastation caused in 2008 could be withstood by just calling on shareholders to sacrifice their equity. If the crash cost more than \u20ac1tn, banks can call on the \u20ac8tn of debts to bondholders, which could be cancelled in part or in their entirety, freeing up cash from interest payments to safeguard depositors. This is a substantial extra buffer. No wonder officials in Brussels, European Central Bank head Mario Draghi and the UK\u2019s regulator, the Bank of England, feel confident a taxpayer bailout will never again be required. So it might seem odd that the International Monetary Fund has sounded a warning in its latest financial stability report about the parlous state of the European banking system... But the IMF is not talking so much about the UK as Italy and other countries in the eurozone periphery. Italy has propped up a forlorn bunch of regional banks that have done little to tackle loans that will never be repaid. Zombie businesses that spend all their spare cash on interest payments, denying them the funds for investment, litter the Italian manufacturing sector, which remains vast... It is estimated that bad loans in Italy account for more than a third of the \u20ac900bn total, which means that a \u20ac6bn rescue fund put forward by Rome is desperately inadequate. So the IMF is less interested in the aggregate figures for European bank funding and more concerned about the weakest link, which experience tells us can set off a chain reaction, bringing good banks down with the bad. For that reason the IMF should be applauded. More here: A day after cutting its global growth forecasts, the International Monetary Fund is talking about the risks of a new financial crisis. Larry Elliott writes: The International Monetary Fund has highlighted risks of a new financial crisis, warning that global output could be cut by 4% over the next five years by a repeat of the market mayhem witnessed during the 2008-9 recession. The IMF used its half-yearly Global Financial Stability Report to call for urgent action on the problems of banks in the eurozone, a third of which it said faced \u201csignificant challenges\u201d to be sustainably profitable. \u201cIn the euro area, market pressures also highlighted long-standing legacy issues, indicating that a more complete solution to European banks\u2019 problems cannot be further postponed,\u201d the Fund said. It said there needed to be a comprehensive strategy to deal with \u20ac900bn of non-performing loans (NPLs) on the books of eurozone banks, adding that banks also needed to be closed in order to deal with excess capacity. \u201cThe hardest hit banking systems within the euro area in February have been those of Greece, Italy, and to a lesser extent, Portugal, along with some large German banks, reflecting some or all of the following factors: structural problems of excess bank capacity, high levels of NPLs, and poorly adapted business models.\u201d Noting that threats to global financial stability had increased since its last health check in October, the Fund said: \u201cThe main message of this report is that additional measures are needed to deliver a more balanced and potent policy mix for improving the growth and inflation outlook and securing financial stability. In the absence of such measures, market turmoil may recur.\u201d It added that there was a risk that investors would demand high interest rates and that tougher financial conditions would create a \u201cpernicious feedback loop\u201d of fragile confidence, lower growth and inflation, and rising debt. The full story is here: Five of the top eight US banks do not have credible plans for winding down their operations during a crisis without being bailed out with public money, according to a report from federal regulators. Reuters reports: The \u201cliving wills\u201d that the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation jointly agreed were not credible came from Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, J.P. Morgan Chase, State Street and Wells Fargo. The requirement for a living will was part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation passed in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when the US government spent billions of dollars on bailouts to keep big banks from failing and wrecking the US economy. \u201cThe FDIC and Federal Reserve are committed to carrying out the statutory mandate that systemically important financial institutions demonstrate a clear path to an orderly failure under bankruptcy at no cost to taxpayers,\u201d FDIC chairman Martin Gruenberg said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s action is a significant step toward achieving that goal.\u201d None of the eight systemically important banks, which the US government considers \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d fared well in the evaluations. A bank has to fix deficiencies only if the two regulators jointly determine its plan does not have the potential to work. The FDIC alone determined that the plan submitted by Goldman Sachs was not credible, while the Federal Reserve Board on its own found Morgan Stanley\u2019s plan not credible. Citigroup\u2019s living will did pass, but the regulators noted it had \u201cshortcomings.\u201d The Fed and the FDIC said they were continuing to assess plans for four foreign banks - Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS. The weaker than expected US retail sales figures could give the Federal Reserve pause for thought on interest rates, said Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: Consumer spending remains a core component of the US economy, so all eyes will be on these latest sales figures from Main Street. Last year, economists heralded the resilience of US consumers as a rare bright spot against a backdrop of turbulent financial markets and weakening global demand, so they will be discouraged by this below expectations performance. These lingering doubts over retail\u2019s strength may force the Fed to give second thought to the rumoured interest rate hike, which some had speculated could come sooner rather than later. A drop in car purchases caused an unexpected drop in US retail sales in March, according to the Commerce Department. Retail sales fell 0.3% after being unchanged in February, and compared to forecasts of a 0.1% rise. Core retail sales - excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services - edged up 0.1% in March, the same as an upwardly revised figure for February. A vote by Britain to leave the European Union would damage the UK economy, according to the majority of economists surveyed in a Reuters poll. Thirty one of the 35 economists polled said the impact of leaving would be negative, but there was a roughly equal split about whether remaining in the EU would be positive or neutral. A vote to leave was also likely to lead to a Bank of England rate cut, the majority of the economists believed. Opec has predicted that global demand for oil will be less than previously expected in its latest monthly report. The oil producers group cut its forecast for 2016 demand by 50,000 barrels a day as consumption slows, and said there could be further downward revisions. Meanwhile it pumped 32.25m barrels a day in March, up by 15,000 barrels from the previous month. The report indicated excess supply of 790,000 barrels a day in 2016 at current levels, up from 760,000 suggested last month. The figures come ahead of a key meeting of producers in Doha at the weekend, which will discuss a freeze in output at January\u2019s levels to try and tackle the supply glut. The oil price has been fairly unmoved by the report, with all eyes on the weekend meeting. Brent crude is down 1% at $44.19 a barrel, in line with its earlier performance. Time for a quick catch-up Stock markets in Asia and Europe have rallied today, after China beat expectations with an 11% surge in exports in March. Augustin Eden, research analyst at Accendo Markets,. sums up the morning: \u201cMid-way through the European session, equity markets are holding firm with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 benefiting from a good set of Chinese trade data - that helping the miners and other EM-focused stocks. Does this mean better times ahead? We must be careful when answering such a question, but with Chinese copper imports having surged by 36% in March, the near-term outlook seems trade positive. So as we stand.... The FTSE 100 index is on track for its highest close of 2016. It\u2019s currently up 90 points in London, led by natural resource companies and financial stocks. Traders are optimistic that the worst of the commodity slump may be over, if Chinese firms are faring better than feared. JP Morgan has reported a 6.6% fall in profits, better than feared. Its shares are likely to rally when Wall Street opens. UK supermarket chain Tesco is under pressure. Its shares have slumped by 5.5%, despite posting its first sales rise in three years, after CEO Dave Lewis warned that the market is challenging and uncertain. Greek bonds have weakened, on fears that bailout talks with its creditors are floundering. Shares in Premier Foods, owner of Mr Kipling cakes and other kitchen staples, have slumped by 30% after a potential takeover bidder walked away. A Chinese hard landing is the number one fear in the City, according to a new survey from Moodys\u2019s. The rating agency found that a third of investors believe China\u2019s slowing economy is the biggest risk, followed to deflation in the euro area. Investors are also worried about a rise in support for European populist parties and Britain\u2019s EU referendum. Anke Rindermann, an associate Managing Director at Moody\u2019s, hopes that a Chinese economic crisis can be avoided: \u201cIt is clear that a slowing Chinese economy is a major concern among market participants. However, rather than a hard landing we expect a continuation of slower GDP growth at around 6% as Chinese authorities continue to use policy measures to avoid a sharp economic slowdown.\u201d Wall Street is expected to open strongly in two hours time: JP Morgan\u2019s shares are up almost 3% in pre-market trading, as Wall Street welcomes its financial results. Bank of America and Citigroup are up around 2% in the pre-market too. JP Morgan has reported a 6.6% drop in profits in the last quarter, down from $5.91bn to $5.52bn. As feared, the Wall Street bank has suffered a fall in revenues from trading and investment banking. But the results look a little better than expected. JP Morgan has posted average earnings of $1.35 per share, down from $1.45, but ahead of forecasts of $1.26 per share. It has also set aside over $400m to cover bad losses in the energy sector. That follows the recent slump in the oil price, which is causing some energy companies serious financial distress. It\u2019s nearly time for JP Morgan to kick off the US bank reporting season, by revealing how well (or badly) it performed in the last three months. Analysts predict that earnings and revenues both fell during the quarter, as investment banking has suffered from lower trading volumes and fewer major deals recently. And the banks always have the capacity to surprise us, as Jeremy Cook, economist at World First, points out: Beneath the optimism in the markets, worries over Greece\u2019s bailout are resurfacing. Investors are concerned by Athens\u2019 ongoing failure to reach a deal with creditors over issues such as pension reforms. So prices on Greek bonds have fallen sharply this morning. And this has driven up the yield, or interest rate, on Greek two-year debt to 12.5%, from 11% yesterday. That\u2019s a 10-week high, and implies a higher risk of Greece defaulting. Talks between Greece and its bailout creditors over the country\u2019s next economic reforms efforts are now suspended until next week. If a deal isn\u2019t reached eventually, Greece won\u2019t have the funds for debt repayments in July. And Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s prime minister, has now arranged to meet with French president Francois Hollande - a key ally - next week. Italian bank shares have risen sharply this morning, up around 6% on average. The \u20ac5bn bank rescue deal agreed over the weekend is bolstering confidence in the sector. But caution is needed -- Italian banks still hold around \u20ac196bn of bad debts, so \u20ac5bn will only be a sticking plaster if the eurozone crisis flares up again. There\u2019s no stopping the FTSE 100 index right now. The blue-chip index is up 95 points at 6337, its highest level since last December. Mining stocks continue to surge, thanks to new optimism about China\u2019s economy following March\u2019s 11% jump in exports. Shares in Anglo American are up 7% and BHP Billiton has gained 6%. Banks are benefitting too. Standard Chartered, which has a big exposure to Asian markets, has jumped by 10% to the top of the FTSE leaderboard. Joshua Mahoney of IG says the City is hoping that the worst could be over for commodities. For the commodities rout to be over a resurgent China is required, and the impressive trade data released overnight provided exactly the assurance we were looking for. While it may be too soon to conclude that the worst is over for China, this revival in exports helps restore confidence as investors pile into commodity stocks once more. David Cheetham of City broker XTB.com reckons Tesco is on the right path, despite this morning\u2019s stock market drubbing: A 0.9% rise in like-for-like sales for Q4 2015 is arguably the highlight of this solid report, and marks the first quarter of comparable sales growth in over three years.... More work is clearly needed before investors can hope for a return to anywhere near the previous levels of stock price, but this morning\u2019s report shows that the current strategy is beginning to bear fruit and the continued attempts by Mr. Lewis to streamline the business and dispose of unwanted segments indicate that the firm won\u2019t be resting on it\u2019s laurels as they strive to return to former glories. Tesco is now the worst-performing share across Europe\u2019s main stock markets, after it warned that the supermarket sector remains tough. Here\u2019s our full story on Tesco\u2019s results: European stock markets are rallying hard, on the back of today\u2019s Chinese trade data. The Italian, German and French markets have all gained around 2%, a strong move, amid hopes that the global economy may be picking up. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct calls it \u201ca rather impressive start\u201d. Commodities remain very much in focus \u2013 we\u2019ve seen base metals soaring in the last few hours helped by upbeat Chinese import data and even if oil prices are coming off the boil a little, the bulls are still winning out at least for now. But investors may be getting carried away..... The 11% surge in Chinese exports in March sounds impressive, but manufacturers are actually still shipping fewer goods abroad than on average, as this tweet shows: News that Chinese exports rebounded in March has \u201cmore than revitalised the market\u2019s spirits\u201d, says Conner Campbell of SpreadEx: Whilst it is too early to claim that talk of a Chinese economic slowdown has been overstated (imports did shrink by 7.6% over March, and there is still the Q1 GDP and industrial production data to come on Friday), the announcement of an 11% rise in the country\u2019s exports has had a miraculous effect on the European indices this Wednesday morning. Tesco is missing out on today\u2019s rally, despite reporting its first sales increase in three years. Shares in the supermarket chain have slumped by 4%, after CEO Dave Lewis warned that hitting analyst profit forecasts for this year would be a \u201cbig achievement\u201d. That\u2019s not what the City likes to hear. Lewis\u2019s caution has taken the shine off today\u2019s results, which showed a 0.9% jump in sales and a small rise in operating profits. Shares are rallying across Europe at the start of trading, as China\u2019s trade figures boost confidence. In London, the FTSE 100 index has hit its highest level of 2016. The blue-chip index has gained 63 points, or 1%, to 6302 points. That\u2019s quite a recovery since the turmoil of January and February, when it fell to 5,500. Mining stocks are leading the way, on hopes that demand for commodities like iron ore, copper and zinc may be picking up. Augustin Eden, research analyst at Accendo Markets, explains why shares are rallying: In March, Chinese exports went up by 11.5% (in US dollar terms), the most in a year and an impressive recovery from February\u2019s 25% slump. That\u2019s sure to indicate that China\u2019s still making stuff, so should be a good thing for companies that produce materials - like miners \u2013 today. Other European markets are also romping ahead. Mixing Ambrosia custard and Bisto gravy with Schwartz\u2019s dried spices would challenge the most daring fusion chef. So perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that an attempt to merge the companies behind these brands has also failed. McCormick, the US food group, told the City this morning that it\u2019s walking away from attempts to acquire Britain\u2019s Premier Foods, which produces Mr Kipling cakes alongside Ambrosia, Bisto and Batchelors soups. Premier Foods had resisted McCormick\u2019s advances, angering shareholders such as Standard Life. And the City is reacting -- Premier Foods share just plunged by 30% at the start of trading! Here\u2019s the story: The rebound in China\u2019s exports shows that pessimism over the global economy is overdone, argues Marcel Thieliant and Mark Williams of Capital Economics: China\u2019s trade data for March point to healthy growth in import volumes and add to growing evidence that the extreme gloom of a few weeks ago about the state of the domestic economy was misplaced\u2026. However, they also point out that the data is muddied by the impact of the Chinese New Year, so we shouldn\u2019t get too carried away. Asian markets are rallying hard, following news that Chinese exports surged 11% in March. The Shanghai stock market jumped by 2%, as investors hailed the better-than-expected trade figures. Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed 2.5% higher, while Australia gained 1.5%. Some investors are calculating that China\u2019s new growth figures, due on Friday, might beat expectations. Economists had forecast that annual growth to slow to 6.7% in January to March, from 6.9%. Perhaps that\u2019s too pessimistic?.... There\u2019s relief in the markets this morning after China posted surprisingly good trade figures. Chinese exports rose by 11.5% percent on-year in March, in dollar terms, the biggest jump since February 2015. That\u2019s a significant recovery from the 25% slump seen in February - when the Lunar New Year disrupted trade. Imports in March shrank by 7.6%, less than expected, after a 13.8% slump a month ago. And this means China\u2019s trade surplus decreased to $29.9 billion, the least in a year. This beats analyst forecasts, and suggests that China\u2019s economy may be avoiding the kind of \u2018hard landing\u2019 that would shake the global economy. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains why traders will be encouraged by China\u2019s trade data: The surge in exports adds to the improving outlook for China indicated by moderating producer price inflation and a rebound in business confidence data. The pickup in exports was likely supported by the devaluation of the yuan at the start of the year which made Chinese goods relatively cheaper than domestic options abroad. Standard Chartered Bank economist Shuang Ding is more cautious, though: \u201cEven with this rebound, first-quarter trade is still quite weak....We cannot be very definite about a turnaround.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a big day for corporate results. UK supermarket chain Tesco is publishing its full-year results today. At first glance, it appears that CEO Dave Lewis\u2019s turnaround plan is bearing fruit, with profits up and sales returning to growth. And then JPMorgan Chase will kick off the US reporting season around noon BST. That\u2019ll show how Wall Street is coping with the current environment of record low interest rates and financial volatility. Over in Washington, The International Monetary Fund will release its Global Financial Stability Report at 2pm GMT. That\u2019ll highlight the key threats to the world economy. Yesterday, the Fund caused a stir with a warning about Britain\u2019s EU referendum, alongside a raft of growth cuts: And Greece could be in the spotlight again, after failing to reach a deal with its creditors over economic reforms this week. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"Some of the US\u2019s biggest banks still lack a proper plan for bankruptcy, in the event of another major financial crisis, US regulators said on Wednesday. In the wake of the great recession banks were required to come up with \u201cliving wills\u201d to prove they had a credible plan for bankruptcy that would not require another bailout from the taxpayers. But after reviewing the plans of five institutions \u2013 JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street Corp \u2013 the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) have determined that the banks have yet to meet that requirement. \u201cThe goal to end too big to fail and protect the American taxpayers by ending bailouts remains just that: only a goal,\u201d said Thomas Hoenig, FDIC vice-chairman. The banks are to submit revised proposals by 1 October. According to feedback from the regulators, one of the main concerns with JP Morgan\u2019s proposal was the bank\u2019s liquidity in a time of need. Regulators were concerned the bank would not be able to shift money around to fund some of its operation during a time of stress or bankruptcy. \u201cObviously we were disappointed,\u201d said Marianne Lake, JP Morgan\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cThe most important thing is that we work with our regulators to understand their feedback in more detail.\u201d Bank of America also needs better processes for estimating its liquidity needs, the regulators said. And while Wells Fargo was deemed to have \u201cfirm-wide, high-quality liquid assets\u201d, regulators raised concerns over \u201cquality control, senior management oversight, and recovery and resolutions planning staffing\u201d. In its statement, Wells Fargo said it was disappointed its plan was \u201cdetermined to have deficiencies\u201d but the feedback was \u201cconstructive and valuable to our resolution planning process\u201d. If these banks do not submit acceptable plans by October, regulators could impose sanctions such as higher capital requirements and restrictions on growth. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also received their feedback on Wednesday. While Goldman Sachs\u2019s plan passed muster with the Fed, it was deemed wanting by the FDIC. Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, did not meet the legal standards according to the Fed, but the FDIC gave a more positive assessment. Citigroup was the only bank whose plan was accepted by both agencies. It too, however, received feedback containing shortcomings that it has to fix by July 2017. The regulators\u2019 rejections of a handful of banks\u2019 living wills is likely to fuel criticism that the banks are still \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and could force another huge taxpayer bailout should there be another major financial crisis. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has previously said that if elected president he would try to break up big banks. However, when pushed on exactly how he intended to do that by the New York Daily News editorial board, the Vermont senator struggled to provide a detailed answer. The process of drafting living wills was introduced in the Dodd-Frank rules brought in by Congress after the financial crisis in order to tackle the systemic risks posed by the collapse of the financial industry. The process of drawing up the wills is ongoing and that the banking industry is committed to working with the regulators, said John Dearie, CEO of Financial Services Forum \u2013 a trade group that represents 16 of the largest banks with the exception of Wells Fargo. \u201cNo financial company should be considered too big to fail. The principal regulators have said that there has been substantial progress in their ability to resolve the largest US financial institutions,\u201d Dearie said. \u201cThe Dodd-Frank Act clearly mandates that taxpayer funds can never again be accessed \u2013 nor should they. Thus, it is in the best interest of the industry that all large institutions have credible resolutions plans and, with that in mind, institutions will continue to work to address the technical shortcomings identified in this round of regulatory feedback.\u201d Proposals by Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS are still under review.",

I think that is likely, but I\u2019m not in charge of interest rates.\u201d</p> <p>Osborne said minutes of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, contain \u201crepeated reference to the fact that there is an inflation mandate and they will stick to delivering their inflation mandate\u201d.</p> <p>Osborne\u2019s argument is that if there is a vote to quit the EU, sterling would slump and that would push up the cost of imports. That would mean rising prices and the MPC would have to act to prevent inflation taking hold.</p> <p>He said this could lead to the MPC raising interest rates from their all-time low of 0.5% - where they have sat since 2009. \u201cYou would have rising prices and a Bank of England with an inflation target committed to respond to that,\u201d Osborne said at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spring meetings in Washington on Friday.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full story is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/15/george-osborne-says-brexit-will-drive-up-interest-rates\">George Osborne says Brexit will drive up mortgage rates</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57110a40e4b0430a54a055d7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-15T16:06:03.093Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European shares end lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With Chinese economic growth slowing down - albeit in line with expectations - and oil sliding ahead of this weekend\u2019s meeting of producers in Doha, European shares have ended the week on a negative note.

Draghi said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Taking into account the current outlook for price stability, the Governing Council expects the ECB\u2019s key policy rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. We are confident that the very accommodative monetary policy stance will provide further support to the euro area recovery and will accelerate the return of inflation to levels that we consider to be consistent with our objective. The Governing Council has done and, within its mandate, will continue to do whatever is needed to pursue its price stability objective.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said the eurozone economy was on a gradual path to recovery but added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The outlook for euro area growth remains faced with uncertainty, mainly as a result of downside risks to growth prospects in emerging market economies, a clouded outlook for oil prices and their economic implications, and also geopolitical risks.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for inflation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Looking ahead, inflation in the euro area is likely to display slightly negative rates in the coming months before picking up later in 2016. Thereafter, supported by our substantial monetary stimulus and the projected evolution of energy prices and economic developments more generally, euro area inflation rates should recover further. In the current context, it is crucial for the ECB to ensure that the very low inflation environment does not become entrenched in second-round effects on wage and price-setting.</p> </blockquote> <p>The banking sector has seen increased stability, he said, but non performing loans need to be dealt with:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The stability of the euro area banking sector has improved significantly over the past few years. Bank capital and provisions have been substantially reinforced and bank profitability has started to rise again. However, against the background of a moderate economic recovery, this profitability remains low. Structural factors may also be at play. In addition, in some jurisdictions, a high stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) continues to linger as a legacy of the earlier crisis. As this may constrain banks\u2019 lending capacity and their ability to build up further capital buffers, determined action is needed. Cooperation among all major stakeholders, including governments, banks, regulators and investors, at national and European level, is necessary in order to make substantial progress in this field. Tailored approaches, based on a thorough understanding of country-specific aspects and in the context of a comprehensive strategy that is led as much as possible by the private sector, are needed. The banking supervision arm of the ECB is working from the supervisory perspective, on identifying best practices that can be adopted by individual banks. Certainly, a decline in NPL ratios will also be facilitated by an environment of stronger economic growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-571101cbe4b032afbf75ded5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-15T15:04:10.869Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The beginning of the end of the Greek crisis?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> Meanwhile Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has welcomed (to put it mildly) the news that the ECB will accept bonds from Greek banks in its QE programme.

One suspects not and this will need to be closely monitored for it to be an effective way of manageing the oil price.</p> <p>On Monday we should have some visibility as to what the outcome of the meeting has been. An agreement to freeze will be good for the oil price in the short term, but any sign of cheating would be viewed negatively by the market, making the whole process to that point pointless.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brent crude is currently down 2.5% at $42.7 a barrel.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5710eeb7e4b0b6cdbb76a23c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-15T13:41:20.320Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US industrial production figures are \u201cbad, bad and bad\u201d, says Rob Carnell of ING Bank, and cast doubts on a June rate rise let alone one in April. He says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Following a 0.6% decline in February, which we felt was dominated by warmer than usual weather depressing utilities output, a small bounce in activity, or at least a smaller decline in overall industrial production looked a sensible forecast, backed up by a slight bounce in the manufacturing ISM index.</p> <p>But production fell a further 0.6% month on month, utility production fell less than in February, but still by a sizeable 1.2% month on month, while mining (for which read in large part - shale extraction) fell at an accelerated pace of 2.9% (-1.0% in Feb) and manufacturing also accelerated its decline falling by 0.3% month on month, with particularly large fall (-1.6% month on month) in motor vehicles and parts. If that were not bad enough, even the February figures saw some small downward revisions. </p> <p>This data almost brings to an end the major activity releases for the first quarter, and the net result is not a good one. On our rough reckoning, it will be hard for first quarter 2016 GDP to exceed 1.0% continuing the run of soft data that delivered only a 1.4% quarter on quarter rise in economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2015. So economic growth continues to slow, and the inflation data has also been a little softer of late.</p> <p>Put all this together and the case for an April rate hike is non-existent, with prospects for a June hike hanging in the balance and needing a meaningful pick up in activity data over the coming months. We still prefer the idea that the Fed will keep policy unchanged until the third quarter of 2016.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5710eaf6e4b0b6cdbb76a239\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-15T13:24:55.185Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Weak US industrial production</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to the US, and some weaker than expected industrial data, to follow the better than expected New York manufacturing survey.</p> <p>Industrial output fell by 0.6% in March, with February\u2019s figure revised down from a 0.5% drop to 0.6%.</p> <p>Analysts had been expecting a dip of 0.1% last month.</p> <p>Industrial production fell at an annual rate of 2.2% in the first quarter</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5710e9a4e4b02bf966f8f3f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-15T13:20:57.533Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Treasury and Bank of England have now confirmed Citigroup\u2019s Michael Saunders will replace Martin Weale on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, as of 9 August.

                "bodyText":"The number of oil rigs drilling in the US dipped last week for the fourth week in a row, according to the regular survey by Baker Hughes. Oil rig numbers dipped by 3 to 351, the lowest level since November 2009, while the number of gas rigs was unchanged at 89: Following the news, Brent crude is down 1.7% at $43.08 a barrel, ahead of the key meeting in Doha over the weekend when oil producers will discuss possible production freezes. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. There are likely to be only modest US interest rate rises this year, with economic conditions riskier than they were when the Federal Reserve raised rates in December. That is the view of Chicago Fed president Charles Evans, in a speech in Washington. He said that a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach was appropriate given the risks. UK chancellor George Osborne has added more fuel to the flames of the Brexit debate by saying in Washington that mortgage rates would rise in Britain left the EU. Rupert Neate and Katie Allen report: The chancellor said he thought it was \u201clikely\u201d that interest rates, and therefore the cost of home loans, would rise if Britons vote to leave the EU in the referendum on 23 June. Asked if he thought that the cost of mortgages would increase on a British exit from the 28-nation bloc Osborne said: \u201cThe short answer is yes. I think that is likely, but I\u2019m not in charge of interest rates.\u201d Osborne said minutes of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, contain \u201crepeated reference to the fact that there is an inflation mandate and they will stick to delivering their inflation mandate\u201d. Osborne\u2019s argument is that if there is a vote to quit the EU, sterling would slump and that would push up the cost of imports. That would mean rising prices and the MPC would have to act to prevent inflation taking hold. He said this could lead to the MPC raising interest rates from their all-time low of 0.5% - where they have sat since 2009. \u201cYou would have rising prices and a Bank of England with an inflation target committed to respond to that,\u201d Osborne said at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spring meetings in Washington on Friday. The full story is here: With Chinese economic growth slowing down - albeit in line with expectations - and oil sliding ahead of this weekend\u2019s meeting of producers in Doha, European shares have ended the week on a negative note. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: It has perhaps been a predictably muted end to the week for London\u2019s FTSE-100. The benchmark index is sitting a little lower on the day but we\u2019re closing well up on the week and that\u2019s certainly worth cheering, Sustaining the rally from here however really does rely heavily on a meaningful production freeze being implemented by oil producer nations meeting in Qatar this weekend \u2013 we\u2019ve already seen some pessimism creeping in there over the last few hours, crude is off a touch and this is certainly going to be casting a shadow over sentiment. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 21.35 points or 0.34% at 6343.75 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.42% to 10,051.57 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.36% at 4495.17 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.39% to 18,257.35 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.12% at 8850.9 But in Greece, the Athens market jumped 4.86% to 574.73 after positive news for Greek banks from the ECB On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is virtually unchanged, down just 12 points or 0.07%. Ahead of the Doha meeting, Brent crude is currently down 2.24% at $42.86 a barrel. In an interesting bit of timing, the news that Citigroup economist Michael Saunders was joining the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee came shortly after the US bank reported a 27% drop in first quarter earnings. This is the biggest fall reported by any of the big US banks so far, with the bank blaming lower revenues from trading and investment banking and bad loans to the energy industry following the slide in oil prices. Still, much of this was expected, and the bank\u2019s shares have edged higher following the figures. The European Central Bank will keep rates at their current low (in some cases negative) levels for an extended period, ECB president Mario Draghi has said in a speech in Washington. That means well beyond March 2017 when its bond purchase programme is due to run out. Draghi said: Taking into account the current outlook for price stability, the Governing Council expects the ECB\u2019s key policy rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. We are confident that the very accommodative monetary policy stance will provide further support to the euro area recovery and will accelerate the return of inflation to levels that we consider to be consistent with our objective. The Governing Council has done and, within its mandate, will continue to do whatever is needed to pursue its price stability objective. He said the eurozone economy was on a gradual path to recovery but added: The outlook for euro area growth remains faced with uncertainty, mainly as a result of downside risks to growth prospects in emerging market economies, a clouded outlook for oil prices and their economic implications, and also geopolitical risks. As for inflation: Looking ahead, inflation in the euro area is likely to display slightly negative rates in the coming months before picking up later in 2016. Thereafter, supported by our substantial monetary stimulus and the projected evolution of energy prices and economic developments more generally, euro area inflation rates should recover further. In the current context, it is crucial for the ECB to ensure that the very low inflation environment does not become entrenched in second-round effects on wage and price-setting. The banking sector has seen increased stability, he said, but non performing loans need to be dealt with: The stability of the euro area banking sector has improved significantly over the past few years. Bank capital and provisions have been substantially reinforced and bank profitability has started to rise again. However, against the background of a moderate economic recovery, this profitability remains low. Structural factors may also be at play. In addition, in some jurisdictions, a high stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) continues to linger as a legacy of the earlier crisis. As this may constrain banks\u2019 lending capacity and their ability to build up further capital buffers, determined action is needed. Cooperation among all major stakeholders, including governments, banks, regulators and investors, at national and European level, is necessary in order to make substantial progress in this field. Tailored approaches, based on a thorough understanding of country-specific aspects and in the context of a comprehensive strategy that is led as much as possible by the private sector, are needed. The banking supervision arm of the ECB is working from the supervisory perspective, on identifying best practices that can be adopted by individual banks. Certainly, a decline in NPL ratios will also be facilitated by an environment of stronger economic growth. Meanwhile Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has welcomed (to put it mildly) the news that the ECB will accept bonds from Greek banks in its QE programme. The Athens-Macedonian news agency reported Tsipras commenting in parliament: This decision, he said, amounts to indirect recapitalization as Greek banks may gradually sell during the year up to 50 pct of the EFSF bonds they hold in their portfolios, whose value is estimates at over 30 billion euros. This also means the banks will have a very important boost totaling 18.5 billion euros. \u201cThis development is not only a significant relief for banks and liquidity, it also constitutes the beginning of the end for the crisis and the imminent [program] review,\u201d Tsipras said. IMF director Poul Thomsen has said he expects to come to an agreement on Greece soon, but hardly seemed very positive in some of his other comments. And the various parties involved still seem at odds on key points: The US consumer confidence figures suggest the second quarter has got off to a poor start, says Rob Carnell at ING: Expectations for a rise in the University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment were dashed by a fall - this is beginning to look like a trend. Despite some better recent labour market data and more positive stock market behaviour, US consumers were more downbeat in April, according to the latest University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment. Although the current conditions index did not fall by too much, the expectations component, which has a decent correlation with real personal spending growth, fell more sharply, falling to 79.6 from 81.5 (current conditions only fell 0.2 points to 105.4 and the headline index was down to 89.7 from 91.0). Following a very weak first quarter, what worries us about this release is that it is giving us an early heads-up that the second quarter has also got off to a bad start. In a boost to Greek banks, the European Central Bank earlier announced it would include EFSF notes in its list of eligible securities which it can buy under its quantitative easing programme. Greek banks hold more than \u20ac30bn of these notes, and had not been allowed to sell them in the market, but could now make gains on the securities. More disappointing US data, with the University of Michigan consumer confidence index coming in lower than expected. The preliminary index for April was 89.7, down from 91 in March and below forecasts of a level of 92. Commenting on the weekend\u2019s meeting of oil producers in Doha, analysts at finnCap said: The market is focussing on the meeting in Doha on the 17th when the group of OPEC and non-OPEC countries decide on whether or not to freeze production at January levels which we note were at an all-time high for OPEC. The \u201cgroup\u201d produces over half of global production, but excludes Iran, which is keen to get its production back to pre-sanction levels. Historically, OPEC has not been particularly effective at sticking to quotas so it is unclear if this new group will be any stricter should the freeze be put in place. One suspects not and this will need to be closely monitored for it to be an effective way of manageing the oil price. On Monday we should have some visibility as to what the outcome of the meeting has been. An agreement to freeze will be good for the oil price in the short term, but any sign of cheating would be viewed negatively by the market, making the whole process to that point pointless. Brent crude is currently down 2.5% at $42.7 a barrel. The US industrial production figures are \u201cbad, bad and bad\u201d, says Rob Carnell of ING Bank, and cast doubts on a June rate rise let alone one in April. He says: Following a 0.6% decline in February, which we felt was dominated by warmer than usual weather depressing utilities output, a small bounce in activity, or at least a smaller decline in overall industrial production looked a sensible forecast, backed up by a slight bounce in the manufacturing ISM index. But production fell a further 0.6% month on month, utility production fell less than in February, but still by a sizeable 1.2% month on month, while mining (for which read in large part - shale extraction) fell at an accelerated pace of 2.9% (-1.0% in Feb) and manufacturing also accelerated its decline falling by 0.3% month on month, with particularly large fall (-1.6% month on month) in motor vehicles and parts. If that were not bad enough, even the February figures saw some small downward revisions. This data almost brings to an end the major activity releases for the first quarter, and the net result is not a good one. On our rough reckoning, it will be hard for first quarter 2016 GDP to exceed 1.0% continuing the run of soft data that delivered only a 1.4% quarter on quarter rise in economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2015. So economic growth continues to slow, and the inflation data has also been a little softer of late. Put all this together and the case for an April rate hike is non-existent, with prospects for a June hike hanging in the balance and needing a meaningful pick up in activity data over the coming months. We still prefer the idea that the Fed will keep policy unchanged until the third quarter of 2016. Back to the US, and some weaker than expected industrial data, to follow the better than expected New York manufacturing survey. Industrial output fell by 0.6% in March, with February\u2019s figure revised down from a 0.5% drop to 0.6%. Analysts had been expecting a dip of 0.1% last month. Industrial production fell at an annual rate of 2.2% in the first quarter The Treasury and Bank of England have now confirmed Citigroup\u2019s Michael Saunders will replace Martin Weale on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, as of 9 August. The Treasury said: As an external member of the MPC, Michael Saunders will hold one of nine votes to decide the future path of UK monetary policy. The MPC currently meets monthly to set monetary policy it judges will enable the inflation target to be met. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne said: \u201cI am delighted to appoint Michael Saunders as an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England. \u201cMichael brings a wealth of economic experience both on the UK and global economy and will make a strong addition to the MPC. \u201cI also want to put on record my thanks to Dr Martin Weale for his record of outstanding service to the MPC since 2010, and whose perspective, expertise and insightful contributions have been invaluable during his time in office.\u201d From August the MPC will therefore be: Mark Carney (Governor); Ben Broadbent (Deputy Governor, Monetary Policy); Dame Minouche Shafik (Deputy Governor, Markets and Banking); Sir Jon Cunliffe (Deputy Governor, Financial Stability); Andy Haldane (Executive Director, Monetary Analysis and Chief Economist); Kristin Forbes (external member); Ian McCafferty (external member); Gertjan Vlieghe (external member) and Michael Saunders (external member). Commenting on the announcement, Carney said: On behalf of the Bank of England, I am delighted to welcome Michael Saunders to the Monetary Policy Committee. He brings first-rate knowledge of the UK economy and a wealth of economic and financial experience. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Martin Weale for the exceptional contribution he has made to the work of the Monetary Policy Committee over the past six years. Martin joined the Committee at a time of grave economic challenge for the United Kingdom, bringing invaluable practical knowledge of the UK economy coupled with academic expertise. Amongst his many contributions, Martin advanced our understanding of the labour market, assisted in the development of unconventional monetary policy and supported the Bank\u2019s efforts to increase transparency and effective communication. Martin Weale joined the Monetary Policy Committee in 2010 after 15 years as director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. He was appointed for a second three year term in 2013, which - by a mathematical deduction - ends this year. The Michael Saunders news appears to have come out of Washington where chancellor George Osborne is attending the IMF spring meeting: Here\u2019s Citi\u2019s profile of Saunders: Citigroup economist Michael Saunders is set to replace Martin Weale on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, according to MNI. Upbeat signs from the US economy, with the April Empire manufacturing survey from the New York Federal Reserve showing the business conditions index rising to its highest level in more than a year. The index came in at 9.6, up from 0.6 in March and better than the forecast 2.2. The employment index dipped slightly from 1.98 to 1.92 but the new orders index rose from 9.57 to 11.14. The Fed said: The April 2016 Empire State Manufacturing Survey indicates that business activity expanded for New York manufacturers. The headline general business conditions climbed nine points to 9.6, its highest level in more than a year. The new orders and shipments indexes registered an increase in both orders and shipments, and inventories were slightly lower than last month. The prices paid index climbed sixteen points to 19.2, pointing to a pickup in input price increases, while the prices received index rose above zero, a sign that selling prices increased. Employment levels and the average workweek were little changed from March. The six-month outlook continued to improve. The UK treasury will publish its analysis on Britain\u2019s EU membership by 22 April, with the select committee quizzing chancellor George Osborne on 28 April. The committee will take evidence from the leave campaign a few days earlier, on 20 April. Committee chair Andrew Tyrie said in a statement: The chancellor will be questioned on the Treasury\u2019s own analysis of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU, and the alternatives to it. He has undertaken to publish this by Friday 22 April. Greece will be on the agenda when German chancellor Angela Merkel meets US president Obama on Sunday, according to newspaper Kathimerini: Greece is expected to be among the topics on the agenda of talks on Sunday when US President Barack Obama is to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Hanover. Obama is traveling to Germany to join Merkel for the launch of the Hanover Messe, a major global trade fair for industrial technology. A German government spokesman did not confirm that Greece will be on the agenda, noting that issues relating to the global economy, the Eurozone and Syria will be among the matters up for discussion. It\u2019s exactly one year since the European Central Bank\u2019s press conference was disrupted by a campaigner throwing glitter at Mario Draghi. Jo Witt\u2019s call to \u201cEnd ECB dick-tatorship\u201d made headlines around the world, after she was hauled out of the room by security. She later told us she hoped to draw attention to the unfairness of eurozone austerity. We can try to change our economy. If the ECB was a democratically elected institution we could use it far more for the better. 12 months later, the eurozone economy looks to be in slightly better shape. But the economic imbalances that so angered Witt are still prevalent. She hasn\u2019t forgot about the ECB either, judging by this morning\u2019s tweet: Brent crude is also falling ahead of Sunday\u2019s OPEC meeting, down 1.7% at $43.09 per barrel. Joshua Mahoney of IG says nervousness is gripping the City: A tangible sense of apprehension has swept across global markets today, with traders unwilling to hold positions into the weekend given the clear risk of events in Doha on Sunday. Once more money is beginning to flock into safe haven assets such as gold and the yen, at the expense of the week\u2019s best performers. So if oil producers fail to make progress on Sunday, there could be a nasty market reaction on Monday. City economists are extremely worried that China has embarked on a dangerous new credit bubble, after lending almost doubled in March. The oil price is dipping this morning as hopes of a breakthrough deal between oil producers this weekend fade. OPEC producers are due to gather in Doha on Sunday, to discuss whether to freeze output at January\u2019s levels. But the latest word is that Iran\u2019s oil minister will not be attending the OPEC meeting on Sunday, according to newswire reports. Instead, the country\u2019s OPEC governor will be there. Iran has already guided that it won\u2019t accept a freeze at January levels -- it is looking to boost its production, as sanctions on its oil sales have only just been lifted. Other OPEC members will be desperate to take action to raise the oil price, as cheap crude prices have cost them billions of dollars. However, with or without Iran, OPEC\u2019s ability to influence the market is limited, given the supply glut. US crude oil has fallen by 1% this morning, to $41 per barrel. It could slump sharply next week if OPEC doesn\u2019t make any progress on Sunday. Joe Rundle, Head of Trading at ETX Capital , explains: Confusion reigns supreme and it\u2019s unclear whether we will see oil producers agree to limit production. Swing producer Saudi Arabia is key, but it\u2019s made it clear it will only act if Iran joins the party. In the wild west of oil, no one wants to put down their gun first. The output freeze rumour has been doing the rounds since early February after oil touched on its lowest level in 13 years and it\u2019s proved a useful catalyst for oil bulls as prices have surged 50% since. Indeed any \u2018deal\u2019 is more about sending a signal to markets, rather than achieving any meaningful limits to production. The FTSE 100 index is ending the week on a low note. It\u2019s down by 22 point, or 0.35%, now, led by housebuilders, with China\u2019s slowing growth rate also weighing on the City. More here: Meanwhile in the UK, new housebuilding has jumped at its fastest rate ever. The Office for National Statistics has reported that new homebuilding has jumped by 6.8% in the three months to February. That helped the overall sector to grow by 1.5% during the quarter, despite a slump in demand for new factory plants. Curiously, the ONS\u2019s report is rather more upbeat than the latest survey from data firm Markit, which found that output hit a 10-month low in February. The ONS has actually just published a report (online here) into why the two reports rarely match: Both measures offer the user something different; the Markit PMI is the more timely estimate, but our slower release of data enables us to provide a more comprehensive coverage of the sector. Concern is growing over China\u2019s debt levels after the amount of new credit surged last month. Chinese banks extended 1,370 billion yuan of new loans (\u00a3150bn) in March -- almost doubling Februarys\u2019s 726.6 billion yuan. That confirms that China\u2019s growth is still heavily dependent on credit, as Beijing tries to ensure an orderly slowdown rather than a full-blown crash. Tom Rafferty, Asia economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, is concerned that Chinese debt levels are simply too high, and could trigger problems in the future. It has taken considerable monetary and fiscal policy loosening to stabilise economic growth at this level and this effort has distracted from the reform agenda that is fundamental to long-term economic sustainability. Levels of debt within the Chinese economy are too high and we are concerned that the authorities are not moving quickly enough to address the issue. Rafferty also fears that China\u2019s growth rate will stumble in the coming months, and beyond. Looking further ahead, we are very sceptical that the government\u2019s targeted 6.5% \u201cfloor\u201d for annual economic growth over the next five years will prove attainable and the risk of a sharp economic slowdown, or hard-landing, will persist.\u201d Zhu Haibin, chief China economist at JPMorgan in Hong Kong, is also concerned that China is piling up more and more debt. \u201cThis can\u2019t continue. The key is efficiency of credit use because we know that some of the credit is used to keep these zombie companies alive.\u201d This chart shows how Chinese corporations have been piling up new debt at a faster pace than the country\u2019s growth rate for years: Rating agency Moody\u2019s is worried that China\u2019s stimulus efforts are storing up long-term problems: Today\u2019s growth figures suggest that the recent splurge in Chinese government spending is working. Anna Stupnytska, Global Economist at Fidelity International, shows how investment by state-controlled companies has soared by nearly a fifth: European shares have edged lower at the start of trading: China\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, is sticking to the party line today. It has tweeted several graphs, arguing that the country\u2019s economy is in good health: Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics reckons China\u2019s true growth rate is lower than the official estimate or 6.7%. He\u2019s hopeful, though, that its economy is stabilising. \u201cAs always, the GDP figures will be met with some scepticism. For our part we do think that China\u2019s economy is expanding slower than the official figures suggest \u2013 our China Activity Proxy (CAP) points to growth of 4.1% y/y during the first two months of the year. More positively though, our CAP looks to have at least stabilised last quarter, suggesting that policy easing has helped to avert a deeper downturn. Craig James, chief economist at Commonwealth Securities in Sydney, says there will be relief in Australia, and beyond. All the results are above market expectations, it shows the rebalancing of the economy is proceeding to plan. If anything, the figures are surprisingly high, so one wonders about the sustainability of the growth rate for future months. Hopefully we\u2019ll see other economies around the world focus on lifting their own growth rates.\u201d Gerard Lyons, economic advisor to London mayor Boris Johnson, is also optimistic: Asian markets have fallen following the news that China\u2019s annual growth rate has fallen to 6.7% in the last three months. The Shanghai Composite index has dropped almost 0.5%, while Japan\u2019s Topix is down 0.75%. Not a major selloff; which is understandable, as the GDP figures are bang in line with forecasts. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. If only everything in life was as reliable as China\u2019s GDP. Economists had expected the country\u2019s growth rate to slow to 6.7% in the first quarter of this year. And sure enough, that\u2019s exactly what the country\u2019s statistics body has reported, down from 6.8% three months earlier. At 6.7%, China is now growing at its slowest pace since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Not unexpected, since Beijing\u2019s attempts to shift away from manufacturing towards a more consumption-driven economy. Encouragingly, separate data has shown that China\u2019s economy was a little stronger than expected in March. Industrial production rose by 6.8%, up from 5.9%, while retail sales jumped by 10 .3%, up from 10.2%. So analysts are hoping that China\u2019s recent efforts to ward off a hard landing may be paying off. Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics said: \u201cData from the investment-industry nexus show that the tried and tested stimulus measures of recent months have stirred up the physical part of the economy, especially towards the end of [the first quarter], while consumption remained relatively robust.\u201d However, some investors had hoped that growth might have been a little stronger. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The data confounded some expectations that improved economic performance in February and March would offset the sharp slowdown seen during January. We\u2019ll be tracking the reaction to the Chinese growth data, and other key developments through the day...",

Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Oil producers failed to reach a consensus over limiting production at yesterday\u2019s key meeting in Doha, leaving equities to start the week under something of a shadow, but the downside pressures are certainly looking to be remarkably short-lived.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 and crude oil alike have pared earlier losses, something that could be seen as underlying just where the problem now lies regarding over supply of crude. Yes, Saudi Arabia may be threatening to ramp up output, but with demand stagnant and storage facilities running close to capacity, the argument is looking slightly academic.

                "bodyText":"Stock markets recovered from an early slide in the wake of the weekend\u2019s failure by oil producers to agree an output cut, when Saudi Arabia insisted Iran should take part but the latter refusing, writes Nick Fletcher. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: Oil producers failed to reach a consensus over limiting production at yesterday\u2019s key meeting in Doha, leaving equities to start the week under something of a shadow, but the downside pressures are certainly looking to be remarkably short-lived. The FTSE 100 and crude oil alike have pared earlier losses, something that could be seen as underlying just where the problem now lies regarding over supply of crude. Yes, Saudi Arabia may be threatening to ramp up output, but with demand stagnant and storage facilities running close to capacity, the argument is looking slightly academic. On top of this we have Opec set to reconvene in two months time, by which time Iran will have made some progress in terms of accelerating its production. This debate still has some distance to run and equity markets are applauding the fact it\u2019s far from over. An oil workers strike in Kuwait which cut the country\u2019s output in half also gave some support to the crude price. So Brent is currently down just 0.3% at $42.94 a barrel having earlier fallen as low as $40.1. On the European markets, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 0.15% or 9.77 points at 6353.52, recovering from a low of 6261 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.68% to 10,120.31 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.26% to 4506.84 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.55% to 18,358.25 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.35% at 8881.6 But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.06% to 574.37 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 72 points or 0.41% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Wall Street has opened lower, as Doha disappointment reaches New York. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 43 points, or 0.25%, in early trading, with the falling oil price hitting energy firms. Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has met with EC vice-president Jyrki Katainen today, as efforts to break the deadlock between Greece and its lenders continue. Tsipras\u2019s office say that the PM told Katainen that the emphasis now should be on growth, investment and employment, rather than finding additional spending cuts. Katainen has tweeted that the talks were productive: Officials representing Greece\u2019s lenders are arriving back in Athens today, for fresh talks. It\u2019s possible (although frankly not very likely) that the review of Greece\u2019s reform measures could be concluded before Friday, when eurozone finance ministers hold a regular meeting. An EC spokesman told a news conference in Brussels that: The aim of the mission remains to conclude the first review of the programme as soon as possible.\u201d The central bank of Brazil appears to have intervened to weaken the real, after seeing it jump by 1.5% against the US dollar in early trading. Oil is coming under more pressure at American investors reach their desks, pushing US and Brent crude down around 4%. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says there\u2019s an \u201cundeniable feeling of disappointed\u201d in the global markets. Despite Iran\u2019s absence in the meeting, expectations were high for a freeze deal to be struck, but the visible dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran sabotaged all efforts consequently causing WTI crude to plunge more than 5%. While realistically the effects of an output freeze would have had a minimal impact on the supply glut, even a symbolic gesture from OPEC to deal with the oversupply could have boosted optimism for future deals. Brazil\u2019s currency has surged at the start of the American trading day, following last night\u2019s congressional vote to impeach president Dilma Rousseff. Investors are calculating that if Rousseff is ousted, a new government could promote more growth-friendly measures and overhaul tax and spending policies. But Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, warns that the markets may have got too excited, given Brazil\u2019s economic problems. The issue now moves to the Senate as the drawn-out process continues its March towards what looks like an inevitable conclusion. Brazilian stocks are now up 23% in 2016 \u2013 that\u2019s 43% up in US dollar terms - and this latest development is likely to add even more momentum to bonds, equity and the Brazilian Real. In all likelihood we will see some profit-taking soon, as the market will start to focus on a post-Rousseff world where the economy must struggle through a deep and long recession. Back in London, Centrica appears to have avoided a major shareholder vote over pay. The parent company of British Gas has been criticised for handing its new boss, Iain Conn, a \u00a33m deal, at a time when it\u2019s also cutting 3,000 workers. But only 15% of shareholders have voted against the package, according to figures released at its annual general meeting today: Iran\u2019s oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, has also insisted that his country won\u2019t join an output freeze. Zanganeh argues that Iran can hardly impose sanctions on itself, having only just shaken off international restrictions. Newsflash from Dubai: Iran has called for other oil producers to continue negotiating an output freeze. Iranian OPEC Governor Hossein \u200eKazempour Ardebilli has told local media that production curbs are needed, but insisted that Iran won\u2019t take part. Reuters has the details: \u201cWe support cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC member countries and efforts to bring stability to the oil market, and we urge all producers to continue their negotiations,\u201d Ardebilli said. But he also said Iran had made it clear that it wanted to regain its share of the oil market lost when it was hit by economic sanctions, and that \u201cits position is supported by most OPEC and non-OPEC members around the world\u201d. Bloomberg have just published an inside account of how the OPEC talks floundered yesterday. It confirms that initial optimism waned once Saudi Arabia surprised attendees by insisting that any deal had to include Iran. And with Iran stayed away from Doha, because they were unwilling to accept an output freeze, there was little chance of agreement. Here\u2019s a flavour: In an apparent reference to Saudi Arabia, Russia\u2019s Novak said at a press conference after the talks that some countries changed their position right before the meeting after agreeing to an earlier draft. \u201cI thought countries that came here, came to agree and not to discuss the need of joining in of those countries that were not participating,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had been disputing today a lot, and that was because some countries from OPEC changed their positions in the morning.\u201d Get your thinking caps on - The Treasury\u2019s new analysis into the risks of Brexit has just been published. Politics Live has full details of the report, and George Osborne\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A which is happening now. The initial panic over the failure of the Doha talks may be easing, as oil recovers some of its early losses. Brent crude is now trading around $42, down around 2.5% from Friday night. Still a chunky loss, but better than the initial 5% tumble. Investors may be concluding that OPEC\u2019s deadlock hasn\u2019t really changed anything, especially as Saudi Arabia and Iran were always unlikely to emerge as best friends. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets , explains: Traders appear to be coming round to the understanding that although no deal came out of the weekend\u2019s Doha oil production freeze meeting, we shouldn\u2019t really have expected anything given the strong stances by Iran (\u2018not while we ramp up post sanctions\u2019) and Saudi Arabia (not without Iran). George Osborne\u2019s report on the benefits of the EU is already making my head hurt. UK chancellor George Osborne is about to give a speech on why Britain should stay within the European Union. He\u2019s announcing an official Treasury report which found that households would be thousands of pounds worse off if Britain leaves the EU, as growth will be slower over the Although journalists were briefed about the report yesterday, it\u2019s only being released this morning. Some Brexit campaigners are already questioning whether the findings are truly accurate, given the government\u2019s strong support for the Remain campaign. Our Politics Live blog is covering Osborne\u2019s speech: Investors in Moscow have reacted badly to the lack of an oil deal. The ruble has slumped by over 1% against the US dollar, to 67.3 from 66.4 on Friday night. The Russian stock market is also suffering, down almost 3% right now. Russia is the world\u2019s largest oil producer, and its 2016 budget was based on an average oil price of $50 per barrel. Readers who can remember the oil price shocks of the 1970s may welcome OPEC\u2019s recent impotence over the price of crude. In an era where market abuse is outlawed and anti-competitive businesses face hefty fines, the oil cartel feels as outdated as flares and jumpsuits. And there is something rather sinister about oil producers gathering, amid a media scrum, to cobble a deal to boost their revenues at the expense of the rest of the world. So many developed economies will welcome the sight of oil falling back towards $40 per barrel, as Mike Bird of the WSJ points out: However.... another bout of oil price volatility might do more harm than good. Oil producers are already suffering fiscal pain, given crude is trading well below their break-even point. The IMF recently predicted that Saudi Arabia would be forced into deep austerity, with tax hikes and spending cuts, unless crude prices recover. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen warned last month that oil could be near a \u201cfinancial tipping point\u201d. If OPEC members slash spending, and oil producers lay off staff, the wider global economy could suffer. Saudi Arabia and Iran have been fighting a proxy war in Yemen for months, so it\u2019s hardly surprising that they can\u2019t get on the same page over oil. In addition, it was clearly implausible that Iranian officials would commit to freezing output at January levels, the point in which sanctions had just been lifted. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, says: Both sides had made their stances clear, although Saudi Arabia clearly thought Tehran might come to the table at the 11th hour. The prospect of cheaper oil is pushing up shares in airlines and holiday firms; every other sector is down, though. European stock markets are falling sharply at the start of trading, following oil\u2019s lead In London, the FTSE 100 has lost 50 points, or 0.7%, to 6299 as a bout of Doha disappointment grips the City. Royal Dutch Shell and BP both lost over 2%, while emerging market-focused bank Standard Chartered is the biggest faller, down 4%. Mining companies are also down, reflecting concerns that emerging market growth will suffer if the oil price remains low. Other European markets have dropped by around 1%: Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, explains how investors had pinned such hopes on OPEC\u2019s meeting. The market had high expectations that an agreement would be forged in Doha yesterday to limit oil production. This failed to materialise and the rally we had observed for crude prices \u2013 which in turn was lending support to the broader equity market \u2013 is now quickly coming undone. Colin Smith, oil and gas analyst at City stockbroker Panmure Gordon, predicts more volatility in the crude price, now that OPEC has shown it cannot agree an output freeze. He adds: Given that this meeting has been three months in the making, it is surprising that it was held at all in the absence of firm commitments to strike a deal and odder still that the position of the most important player, Saudi Arabia, had not been fully firmed up in advance. Iran had always excluded itself from participation in a deal and it was not present at the Doha meeting. The finger pointing suggests that Saudi Arabia could not bring itself to sign a deal without some sort of commitment from Iran and may have been expecting late concessions. This is oil\u2019s biggest one-day plunge since February. Several oil producers are venting their anger about the Doha failure. Falah Alamri, Iraq\u2019s representative, says (via the FT). \u201cWe are very very disappointed.....This will affect the [oil] price and our earnings. We wanted a deal.\u201d Oman\u2019s oil minister, Mohammed Al Rumhy, is also disapppointed: Analysts are largely blaming Saudi Arabia for OPEC\u2019s failure to agree an output freeze. Ed Morse, head of global commodity research at Citigroup, told Bloomberg that: \u201cThe weekend talks are demonstration that the Saudi government, as the deputy crown prince has clearly stated, doesn\u2019t want to cede market share. They are fearful that the world may be in a weak or bearish market for a long period of time. In a bear market, as they learned from the 1980s, if they cede market share it is very difficult to get it back.\u201d The price of oil is sliding sharply this morning, as markets are hit by gloom following yesterday\u2019s OPEC meeting. US crude oil has shed almost 5%, falling to $38.45 per barrel. Brent crude is suffering too, down 4.4% at $41.20. Oil has now lost all its recent gains, as hopes of a breakthrough deal between producers are dashed. Investors are unhappy that the proposed deal to freeze oil output at January\u2019s levels fell apart last night. The talks failed because Saudi Arabia insisted that Iran joined in with the deal - even though Iranian ministers has already warned they wouldn\u2019t take part (and didn\u2019t even show up in Doha). The feuding between the two countries appears to have ruined any chance of a deal between OPEC members, and Russia. That has reignited speculation of a new battle for market share; good news for oil consumers, but potentially damaging to oil producers. Oil and shares have been tracking each other closely for many months, so the Doha fiasco may cause wider losses today.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors have a lot to worry about this week. Firstly, OPEC has just failed to agree a deal to freeze crude output, at their crunch meeting on Sunday. That\u2019s obviously bad for the oil price, and may also prompt a rout in the currencies of commodity currencies. Then there\u2019s Brazil. Overnight, MPs have dramatically voted to impeach Dilma Rousseff, over allegations that her government illegally used money from state-owned banks to cover up the budget deficit. The vote, amid dramatic scenes inside and outside congress, put the Brazilian president in a very sticky situation. Brazilian assets have already been rising, as investors anticipate Rousseff being toppled, and replaced by a more free-market friendly leader. But with her supporters angrily crying \u201ccoup, coup, coup\u201d last night, the future of the recession-dogged country is unclear. Brazil\u2019s woes come at a tough time for the world economy, which appears to be running out of gas again. IMF chief Christine Lagarde will be taking questions on Twitter tonight, from 6pm BST (1pm in Washington). Britain\u2019s EU referendum continues to loom over the markets. Today, the Treasury will be pitching into the war of words, and tit-for-tat statistics, with a report claiming that families will be thousands of pounds worse off after Brexit. Over in Brussels, ministers from across the globe will gather for an emergency summit on the crisis gripping the steel industry - putting thousands of jobs at risk at plants across the UK. And Greece\u2019s lenders are due to resume bailout negotiations with government officials in Athens. There\u2019s no sign that a deal is close, though. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

The breakdown of the talks in Doha on Sunday raised questions about the credibility of the oil cartel after Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, demanded that Iran join any agreement to cap production in an effort to the bolster the price. Oil prices, which fell to 11-year lows at the end of last year, rallied 10% last week before the talks, in anticipation that the first global deal in 15 years could be struck between Opec and non-Opec producers to hold output at January\u2019s levels.

Norbert Ruecker, the head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer, said: \u201cAlthough this was no official meeting of Opec, the organisation has seen a blow to its perceived powerfulness over the weekend.\u201d He said Saudi Arabia was not helping Opec with its tough stance against Iran, which has been keen to bolster supply following the lifting of sanctions. Oil supply was also cut on Monday as a strike in Kuwait knocked its output by more than half, which helped cushion the market reaction to the failure of the Doha talks. Thomas Pugh, a commodities economist at Capital Economics, said he did not expect Opec\u2019s next meeting on 2 June to achieve agreement either, unless there was some softening in the standoff between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which did not send a representative to Doha. Iran had signalled long before this weekend\u2019s meeting that it would take a tough line on restraining production, given that it wants to continue increasing output to get back to levels seen before international sanctions were imposed. Jasper Lawler, a market analysts at CMC Markets, said the sharp oil price moves on Monday had also fed through to stocks, but that the discord in Doha should not have come as a surprise to investors. \u201cAn agreement always seemed highly doubtful when Iran had said it would not freeze output, having just come out of sanctions and Saudi Arabia said it wouldn\u2019t if Iran didn\u2019t. As soon as Iran shunned the meeting by not sending its oil minister it was an un-done deal,\u201d he said. After the talks, Iran\u2019s oil\u2019s minister, Bijan Zanganeh, continued to insist thathis country could not agree to freeze production levels, while the Iranian Opec governor, Hossein \u200eKazempour Ardebili, called on other producers to continue their negotiations. Pugh said: \u201cThe inability to agree even a face-saving deal has further undermined the credibility of Opec after the group failed to decide on an output quota at its last meeting in December ... The lack of any agreement is also likely to undermine some of the positive sentiment that had been built up in the markets in the previous few weeks.\u201d Even before the meeting, a report by the International Energy Agency had concluded that a mere production freeze would have a only limited effect on physical oil supply. Stock markets, which had also slumped on the back of concern about the oil price, also recovered their losses by the end of the day. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares ended nine points higher at 6,353, having been as low as 6,261. Stock markets across most of continental Europe also ended little changed. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrials Index was also flat as European markets closed.",

downturn in March raises some questions, says Rob Carnell of ING:</p> <blockquote> <p>With talk of recession in the US economy beginning to gain traction again ahead of what will probably be a very weak first quarter GDP release next week (just after the April Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee meeting), we are looking for evidence on either side of the argument to help us update our forecasts and confirm or deny the recession argument.</p> <p>We feel the evidence for recession is quite circumstantial, with both weak and strong patches within the US economy. But one of those stronger patches has been the US home building sector, and this has taken a big dent in March. </p> <p>Housing starts fell by 8.8% month on month in March, with permits falling 7.7% month on month. Both single family and multifamily home starts were down sharply, though thanks to strong growth in January and February, this will merely dampen the boost to first quarter GDP growth from residential construction, not overturn it.</p> <p>But with permits providing a forward indication for weak second quarter residential construction, our conviction that what we are seeing is just one of the usual soft-patches in US data, not anything more alarming, is coming under pressure.</p> <p>We have been consistently below the recently cut consensus forecasts for US GDP growth (2.0% for 2016) and remain so even now (ING forcast 1.9%for 2016). But the likelihood of a really weak first quarter 2016 GDP forecast means that we will almost inevitably have to trim our figures further. Something closer to 1.5% for the full-year would be more consistent with the sorts of numbers published for first quarter GDP by the NowCasters, even assuming a recovery to the 2-2.5% range for the rest of the year. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5716299de4b057c2bbe00b2d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-19T13:07:43.877Z\">2.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"48de6419de9c55feb4f546d1e3d873da494252b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48de6419de9c55feb4f546d1e3d873da494252b2/0_0_2000_1250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Argentina flag\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Argentina is about to make a triumphant return to the bond markets, 15 years after defaulting on its debts.</strong></p> <p>After being swamped with interest, Buenos Aires has bumped up its new sale of three, five, 10 and 30-year bonds. </p> <p>It initially planned to raise $15bn, but is now going to sell<strong> $16.5bn</strong> of debt after receiving $65bn of bids from investors hungry for returns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BTabrum/status/722406306565472256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That Argentine deal &#39;capped at $15bn&#39; is in fact going to be $16.5bn</p>&mdash; Burnett Tabrum (@BTabrum) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BTabrum/status/722406306565472256\">April 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a victory for Argentine President Mauricio Macri, who has worked hard to reach a deal with the country\u2019s lenders - such as vulture funds who bought Argentinian debt after its defaulted.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/argentina-reaches-deal-debt-vulture-funds-mediator-155544401.html?ref=gs\">Cutting a deal with such predatory investors can\u2019t be pleasant</a>, but it does allow Argentina to borrow from the markets again. </p> <p><strong>Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investment, argues it\u2019s an important development:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe success of the issue is seen as an endorsement of new president Macri, as it is a huge step forwards with regards to improving Argentina\u2019s financial credibility.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57162559e4b0585020da6e19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-19T12:43:31.406Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oh dear.

This was the green light the DAX needed to roar in to life, jumping by over 200 points to 10350, within a 150 leap away from a fresh 2016 peak. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5715fefae4b0d449d341ebb7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-19T09:55:01.606Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek bailout talks resume today</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greece\u2019s government is resuming talks with its lenders this afternoon over its economic reforms, as the Greek debt crisis threatens to heat up.</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s the first meeting since the International Monetary Fund pushed for Greece\u2019s bailout to be rewritten, to remove unachievable fiscal targets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ManosGiakoumis/status/722360790641205248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Scheduled meetings of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> gov&#39;t w/ mission chiefs on Tue:<br>3pm - Education<br>4pm - Energy<br>5pm - (Privatisation) Fund<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/economy?src=hash\">#economy</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ec?src=hash\">#ec</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ecb?src=hash\">#ecb</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/esm?src=hash\">#esm</a></p>&mdash; Manos Giakoumis (@ManosGiakoumis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ManosGiakoumis/status/722360790641205248\">April 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HelenaSmithGDN/status/722360887873507328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/greek?src=hash\">#greek</a> finance ministry says negotiations with country&#39;s creditor quartet will resume at 3PM 2day with gov officials meeting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IMF?src=hash\">#IMF</a> at 5 PM</p>&mdash; Helena Smith (@HelenaSmithGDN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HelenaSmithGDN/status/722360887873507328\">April 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Greece hasn\u2019t yet convinced its creditors that it has done enough to quality for debt relief, as they wrangle over bad debt rules and pension reforms.</p> <p>The creditors are understood to be pushing for Greece to sign up to extra austerity, in case the bailout programme goes off course.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/greece-creditors-push-for-more-austerity-1460993528\">The Wall Street Journal explains</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The package would be triggered only if Greece falls short of targets over the next three years.

                "bodyText":"As oil prices continued to climb, as the strike in Kuwait outweighed concerns that the weekend meeting of producers failed to agree a cap on output, stock markets moved sharply higher once more. Commodity companies were among the leading risers, and positive results from the likes of L\u2019Oreal also helped sentiment. Silver soared as Chinese buyers moved in, dragging gold along with it. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said: Gold\u2019s rally this year is finally feeding through to silver, which jumped to a 10-month high today. It\u2019s partly a correction in the usual gold-silver trading ratio, as silver has been lagging gold a bit this year and investors feel it needs to catch up. This could be a trend that continues. Longer term silver ought to outperform gold through better fundamentals as it has more industrial uses. The FTSE 100 hit a new fourth month high, reaching its best level since early December, while the MSCI All World index hit a similar peak. French and German markets remained strong, despite some less convincing gains on Wall Street. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 51.83 points or 0.82% at 6405.35 Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 2.27% to 10,349.59 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.32% higher at 4566.48 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.49% to 18,447.98 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.01% better at 8971.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.78% to 578.85 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 23 points or 0.13% higher. Meanwhile Brent crude is up 2.54% at $44 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. To sum up, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned in a Lords committee that leaving the EU could lead to lower economic growth. He defended the Bank commenting on the referendum, saying it was its duty to weigh up the implications of Britain\u2019s membership, but that did not mean it was getting involved in politics. He said UK interest rates could get closer to zero, but said he had no appetite for negative rates. He played down fears of a new round of complex financial instruments similar to those which caused the crash, but said the bank continued to monitor the risks. [And not everything on the original topics for discussion appeared to come up.....] And with that the session ends. Q: How will you pursue climate change agenda [after Paris agreement]? The most important aspect for the Bank is we are regulator of insurance, re-insurance sector. Climate change is one of most important things they have to manage, and they do it well. As regulator, we have to make sure they are on top of it. The bigger risk for financial system is the transition of regulatory environment to move to low carbon environment, and whether it is smooth or abrupt. We will not tell banks to have larger capital requirements if you lend to a larger carbon emitter, we will not put price on carbon. But if there is a prospect of meeting Paris agreement, there will be an adjustment for businesses. The basis point is there needs to be a market in transitions, appropriate disclosure by companies what there strategy is and what their carbon footprint is. Whatever your view, we are agnostic, but you can\u2019t express those views across broader financial world because you don\u2019t have the information Q: How high could interest rates go without doing damage? We do surveys on this. The good news is indebtedness is down. It would have an impact, it\u2019s been a long time since interest rates have moved up. But the position has undoubtedly improved. And when banks are making mortgage decisions, they have affordability tests, including if interest rates go up. Q: Any forward guidance on when we\u2019ll hit 2%? No. [laughs] Q: On the housing market, lenders are edging up to higher loan to value lending, are you still concerned about housing market. The indebtedness of British households has gone down but it still high. It is one of the major risks we watch at MPC, and we watch higher loan to value. Q: what is the risk of house prices coming down in London. We don\u2019t look at housing prices, we look at indebtedness, says Carney. At the higher end [of the London housing market] there has been a move, in terms of negative interest [in property], which could feed through to prices. But I [repeat] there is a degree of uncertainty ahead of EU vote. On productivity Carney says a lack of confidence in future growth is an increasing drag on productivity and investment in the UK and other major countries. Q: Are economic statistics fit for purpose? I commend Charlie Beans review of ONS. It addresses a number of everyday issues where ONS could improve. We work closely with ONS. The most interesting thing of the review is where it draws attention to the undermeasurement of the digital economy. 30 basis points of growth could be missed because of mismeasurement. One of the components of the report is to give ONS greater access to the data we have, subject to confidentiality. Q: So is the CPI an accurate reflection of inflation? We had concerns of move to CPIH, housing move, because we had concerns about rental market. We have to continue to update the inflation basket, he says, but we do have confidence CPI is representative of inflation facing British households. Q: Hasn\u2019t QE caused some of these problems? Is there a danger you will move bubbles elsewhere? This economy has needed monetary stimulus for some time, since the crisis, says Carney. The degree of stimulus has often been less than it appeared; relative to where interest rates needed to go, stimulus has been modest. [With low interest rates] this is an environment where risk can build, in housing market, in infrastructure. We have to act to take out risk where we can. On buy to let, we decided not to take additional action. Tax changes have been considerable, and we want to see how that plays out. These risks build up, we have to be nimble about them. Q: Before the crash banks were issuing very complex instruments. Are you concerned there are trillions of dollars worth of very similar instruments backed by corporate loans in last few years? Instruments which were most problematic were securitisations of securitisations, Carney says. Single securitisation is a reasonable financial instrument But any time something in finance grows rapidly, we should look at it. That\u2019s why we are looking at buy to let because its growing rapidly. Are you confident its not a repeat [of previous problems]? More likely to relate to underlying creditworthiness of issuing entities. Q: Your predecessor said regulation has become too complex. It has become enormous, what is your view. UK is one of most advanced economies in world, a highly complex economy. This isn\u2019t a simple world of barter and agrarian economies, and we shouldn\u2019t go back to that. Banks need to perform functions [which are complex]. The question with regulation whether we blend it with simpler cross checks and take out complexity where we can and with judgement [rather than box ticking]. Part of this process of addressing too complex to fail, is about making sure the institution itself is resolvable - ringfencing is one example. Q: So does regulation make common sense? The common sense elements are the decisive elements. There are some unhelpful and complex regulations, but we have to strip them out. Question: What challenges to financial stability do you see from integration of euro area? What is your assessment of negative interest rates? What do you think of helicopter money? There is a risk is that the process of deepening integration [could] restrict our ability to do our job and deliver financial stability. Crucial to recognise this is a multi-currency union, there must be different degrees of integration, national authorities must have flexibility. We think we could move base rate closer to zero but have not said we have an appetite for negative interest rates. I am not a believer in concept of helicopter money. In effect a central bank cancels debt that is purchased [from government], it puts a hole in its bank sheet. Government never has to recapitalise bank. We create a fundamental problem with reserves on which we have to pay interest, which is not a problem when rates are low, but becomes one when take away stimulus. We do not have an asset on the other side, you end up with a compounded ponzi scheme. Q: are you saying London would be less dominant financial centre if we left the EU. Depends on the negotiations, says Carney, but it is less likely London would remain as a pre-eminent financial centre [if UK left]. City of London unlikely to be enhanced [by Brexit]. Q: Do you agree with Chancellor that Brexit would lead to higher mortgages? Did he consult with Bank? Chancellor did not consult, he is not a member of the MPC, says Carney. There are scenarios where we could have lower GDP and higher inflation, which has implications in terms of higher bank rate, he says. A second factor is bank funding costs, which are passed on to consumers. Risk premium could increase after vote, he says, which would increase funding costs. So two factors which could have an effect and point in the direction of higher mortgage rates. Question: you said Chinese slowdown was greater risk to economy than EU referendum. Still agree? Yes, in medium term the issues are considerable, it depends how they are handled by Chinese authorities. Question: having a complicated financial system is inviting problems, but there is no real attempt to reduce complexity, is there? There are a series of reforms that have sought to reduce complexity, including ringfencing banking, says Carney. With Lehman and Bear Stearns it was not clear how they were linked, Carney indicates. Settling trades through central counterparties helps [with clarity]. On migration, Carney says that older workers staying longer in the workforce has swamped the effect of higher migration to the the UK. Net migration was likely to become more important as the effect of the increase in older workers is exhausted. The effects of migration on wage levels are not material for the Bank of England. More Carney on the uncertainties around the referendum: We will comment on these risks when we have a policy meeting and they come up, but we will not comment through the purdah period of the EU referendum campaign. A reminder: more on Carney\u2019s EU comments in the politics live blog: Carney says there is no intention for the Bank to provide a commentary on that or any other EU analysis. Lord Hollick asks his view on Monday\u2019s Treasury assessment. Carney says it is an analysis of a specific event rather than a Bank economic forecast. The Bank did not take part and it is up to the Treasury to discuss the analysis. But it is a sound analysis, the broad approach makes sense. Carney: Whatever the outcome of the Referendum, the MPC would use its tools to achieve its inflation remit, and, more broadly, the Bank\u2019s policy committees will work in concert, as One Bank, to promote monetary and financial stability. On the EU referendum, Carney says the Bank has not made and will not make any overall assessment of the economics of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. But he added: At the same time, the Bank must assess the implications of the UK\u2019s EU membership for our ability to achieve our core objectives of maintaining monetary and financial stability. The Bank has a duty to report our evidence-based judgments to Parliament and to the public. That is the fundamental standard of an open and transparent central bank. Assessing and reporting major risks does not mean becoming involved in politics; rather it would be political to suppress important judgments which relate directly to the Bank\u2019s remits and which influence our policy actions. These policy actions include developing, and if necessary implementing, contingency plans. As with the Scottish Referendum, we will communicate as much as is prudent about those plans in advance of any risk materialising and as comprehensively as possible once risks have dissipated. The Bank published a detailed, comprehensive report last year which reviewed the how EU membership affects the Bank of England\u2019s ability to achieve its objectives. And he added that there are risks: Some elements of these risks may be beginning to manifest. Since November, the trade-weighted value of sterling has fallen 10%, with more than half of that occurring since the MPC\u2019s last forecast in February. The cost of buying protection against a marked depreciation of sterling has risen notably, with sterling risk reversals falling to their lowest level in over a decade. He added: A vote to leave the EU might result in an extended period of uncertainty about the economic outlook, including about the prospects for export growth. This uncertainty would be likely to push down on demand in the short run. Carney is talking about the housing market, and says growth in mortgage lending is driven solely by the buy to let market. He said: Buy-to-let mortgages increased by 11.5% last year and now account for 17% of the stock of total secured lending, twice the proportion of a decade ago. The PRA has just reviewed the plans of the 31 top lenders in the industry, representing over 90% of total buy-to-let lending. The Review revealed that some banks were applying weaker standards and highlighted the risk that more might do so to meet aggressive growth plans. In response, the PRA has clarified its expectations for buy-to-let underwriting standards and introduced new guidelines for minimum stressed interest rates to be used when lenders test affordability. Given the combination of this prudent reinforcement of underwriting standards and major tax changes now coming into force, the FPC has decided to take no further action at this stage but will continue to monitor potential threats to financial stability from buy-to-let. The session is underway. My colleague Andrew Sparrow will be following Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s comments on Brexit at the Lords committee in the politics live blog: Carney\u2019s appearance before the Lords can be seen live here. Mark Carney is up before the House of Lords economic affairs committee this afternoon in its annual meeting with the Bank of England governor. Here\u2019s a quick look at what is expected to be on the agenda: US markets have made a mixed start in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 31 points or 0.18% following the positive lead from Europe and Asia. But Nasdaq has dipped 21 points or 0.47%. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs, which has just reported a drop in revenues and earnings, is up nearly 1%. Gold and silver continue to gain ground, mainly driven by a weak dollar and Chinese buying. Gold is up 2% to a one week high of $1255 an ounce while silver - the main beneficiary of Chinese demand - has jumped 5% to a ten month high of $17.07 an ounce. US housing has been one of the stronger areas of the economy, so a downturn in March raises some questions, says Rob Carnell of ING: With talk of recession in the US economy beginning to gain traction again ahead of what will probably be a very weak first quarter GDP release next week (just after the April Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee meeting), we are looking for evidence on either side of the argument to help us update our forecasts and confirm or deny the recession argument. We feel the evidence for recession is quite circumstantial, with both weak and strong patches within the US economy. But one of those stronger patches has been the US home building sector, and this has taken a big dent in March. Housing starts fell by 8.8% month on month in March, with permits falling 7.7% month on month. Both single family and multifamily home starts were down sharply, though thanks to strong growth in January and February, this will merely dampen the boost to first quarter GDP growth from residential construction, not overturn it. But with permits providing a forward indication for weak second quarter residential construction, our conviction that what we are seeing is just one of the usual soft-patches in US data, not anything more alarming, is coming under pressure. We have been consistently below the recently cut consensus forecasts for US GDP growth (2.0% for 2016) and remain so even now (ING forcast 1.9%for 2016). But the likelihood of a really weak first quarter 2016 GDP forecast means that we will almost inevitably have to trim our figures further. Something closer to 1.5% for the full-year would be more consistent with the sorts of numbers published for first quarter GDP by the NowCasters, even assuming a recovery to the 2-2.5% range for the rest of the year. Argentina is about to make a triumphant return to the bond markets, 15 years after defaulting on its debts. After being swamped with interest, Buenos Aires has bumped up its new sale of three, five, 10 and 30-year bonds. It initially planned to raise $15bn, but is now going to sell $16.5bn of debt after receiving $65bn of bids from investors hungry for returns. It\u2019s a victory for Argentine President Mauricio Macri, who has worked hard to reach a deal with the country\u2019s lenders - such as vulture funds who bought Argentinian debt after its defaulted. Cutting a deal with such predatory investors can\u2019t be pleasant, but it does allow Argentina to borrow from the markets again. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investment, argues it\u2019s an important development: \u201cThe success of the issue is seen as an endorsement of new president Macri, as it is a huge step forwards with regards to improving Argentina\u2019s financial credibility.\u201d Oh dear. The number of new US house-building projects fell by almost 9% in March, new data shows. Residential housing starts decreased 8.8% to an annual rate of 1.09 million, the lowest since October, according to the Commerce Department. And the number of permits to build a new house also fell, by almost 8%, suggesting America\u2019s construction sector suffered falling demand last month. Traders are selling the US dollar as a result, on the grounds that an early US interest rate rise is less likely. The last three months certainly weren\u2019t a vintage quarter for Goldman Sachs: Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs, says the last three months have been pretty tough. He told shareholders that profits fell over 50% because: \u201cThe operating environment this quarter presented a broad range of challenges, resulting in headwinds across virtually every one of our businesses. \u201cLooking ahead, we will continue to focus on delivering superior service to our clients and managing our business efficiently, which remain essential to generating shareholder value over the long term.\u201d Those \u201cchallenges\u201d includes a drop-off in deal-making (bad for investment bankers), and less demand for share trading from clients due to recent economic uncertainty. This is the fourth consecutive quarterly fall in Goldman\u2019s profits, as its bond traders and investment bankers suffer from tough market conditions. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to Goldman Sachs\u2019 big fall in revenues and profits in the last quarter. https://twitter.com/MattCampbel/status/722390203634159616 Here come Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial results for the last quarter! Goldman has post a big drop in revenues, down from $10.6bn last year to $6.34bn. That\u2019s weaker than the $6.73bn which analysts had expected. And earnings have more than halved during the quarter, at $2.68 per share compared to $5.94 per share in January-March 2015. That beats expectations of $2.45 per share. Goldmand\u2019s income from investment banking income fell by almost a quarter, to $1.46bn. Equities trading suffered a similar decline, to $1.78bn. And CEO Lloyd Blankfein is blunt about market conditions, given market volatility and the lack of big merger deals. Blankfein says Goldman faced a \u201cbroad range of challenges\u201d, with headwinds in almost every one of its business areas. Global stock markets have hit their highest level since last December. The rally in Europe and Asia today, and on Wall Street last night, has pushed MSCI\u2019s All-Country World Stocks index to a four-month high. It\u2019s gained around 12% since early February, when investors were panicking about the slowdown in China and the stability of some European banks. Quite a turnaround, and vindication for those commentators who argued that shareholders should sit tight. The European Commission is gearing up to hit Google with fresh anti-competitive charges, over its Android mobile phone operating system, it appears. The word in Brussels is that European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager could unveil formal antitrust charges on Wednesday. She\u2019s likely to accuse Google of abusing Android\u2019s dominance to give its own apps an unfair advantage against rivals. The case could echo the clashes with Microsoft more than a decade ago, when Brussels took issue with the software giant\u2019s domination of the desktop PC business. The German stock market is roaring ahead today, jumping by 220 point or 2.2%. Traders in Frankfurt were spurred into action by this morning\u2019s ZEW index, showing a leap in German economic confidence. German manufacturers are leading the rally, such as skincarer maker Beiersdorf (+3.8%), chipmaker Infineon Technologies (+3.3%), and chemicals firm BASF (+2.6%). And Europe\u2019s rally is likely to feed through to New York in a few hours time, potentially pushing the Dow Jones index to a new nine-month high. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the morning: Doha what? After Monday\u2019s rather tentative trading following the lack of oil action over the weekend the markets have leapt into life this Tuesday, hitting a bevy of fresh highs in the process. The main thrust of the morning\u2019s growth came from the Eurozone, the catalyst for this surge being the day\u2019s ZEW economic sentiment figures. With the German number coming in at 11.2 (against 8.2 expected and 4.3 last month) and the region-wide data at 21.5 (vastly higher than the 13.9 forecast and the 10.6 seen last month) confidence is picking up, despite the very real threat of a Brexit AND a worsening assessment of the German economy. This was the green light the DAX needed to roar in to life, jumping by over 200 points to 10350, within a 150 leap away from a fresh 2016 peak. Greece\u2019s government is resuming talks with its lenders this afternoon over its economic reforms, as the Greek debt crisis threatens to heat up. It\u2019s the first meeting since the International Monetary Fund pushed for Greece\u2019s bailout to be rewritten, to remove unachievable fiscal targets. Greece hasn\u2019t yet convinced its creditors that it has done enough to quality for debt relief, as they wrangle over bad debt rules and pension reforms. The creditors are understood to be pushing for Greece to sign up to extra austerity, in case the bailout programme goes off course. The Wall Street Journal explains: The package would be triggered only if Greece falls short of targets over the next three years. But the proposals, which come on top of a list of austerity measures already being negotiated, would have to be passed into law now\u2014posing a stiff test for the governing coalition of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, which has a majority of only three seats in parliament. Economic expectations in German has smashed forecasts, despite worries about Britain\u2019s EU referendum. The ZEW Institute\u2019s German economic sentiment index has surged to 11.2 this month, up from just 4.3 in March. Analysts had expected economic expectations (or Konjunkturerwartungen) to rise to 8. ZEW says recent \u201csurprisingly positive economic news\u201d from China has given investors more confidence about future prospects [Chinese exports surged in February, while the economy grew by a decent 6.7% in the last quarter]. However, German investors are less optimistic about their domestic economy. ZEW says: The assessment of the economic situation in Germany worsened. The index has fallen by 3.0 points and now stands at 47.7 points. And ZEW\u2019s Professor Dr. Sascha Steffen remains cautious, especially with Britain\u2019s Brexit referendum looming. The bottom line, however, the continuing weak growth in China and other key emerging markets remain a burden on the German export industry. The concern about a possible withdrawal from the EU Britain is likely to affect burdensome.\u201d Niels Christensen, foreign exchange strategist at Nordea, says the recovery in oil has sent confidence gushing through the markets: He says (via Reuters) \u201cIt is quite amazing how oil prices have recovered from Monday\u2019s lows. That is shoring up risk appetite and pushing up commodity-linked currencies. \u201cAs long as oil remains above $43 a barrel we think commodity currencies will remain supported.\u201d Brent is currently trading at $43.24 per barrel.... That \u2018party on, dudes\u2019 feeling has driven European stock markets to three-month highs. Consumer goods firms are leading the way after France\u2019s L\u2019Oreal posted solid sales and profit figures this morning. Miners are also up, reflecting the weaker US dollar, while banks are benefitting from more optimism about emerging market economies. This has sent the Stoxx 600 index, the broad measure of European shares, to its highest level since January. And the FTSE 100 is still at its highest level since December, as the City shows some sunny optimism. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explains why: \u201cEquity markets are handsomely positive this morning, still benefiting from the oil price rebound as supply disruption from a Kuwaiti strike helps offsets the (misplaced) weekend disappointment from Doha. A weak US dollar following dovish Fed commentary is also keeping commodities and their miners bid while a Dow Jones back at 9-month highs 18,000 and a decent US earnings season so far is maintaining risk appetite. Equities continue to extend their gains from 2016 lows taking headwinds in the stride and preferring to focus on the positives. The workers\u2019 strike that has halved Kuwait\u2019s oil output looks terribly civilised, judging by these photos from Sunday: The oil workers are protesting against cuts to pay and benefits, which Kuwait is enforcing after the slump in oil revenues played havoc with its budget. The Kuwaiti government has urged workers to return to duty, and threatened legal action against the \u201cinstigators\u201d of the walkout. But analysts predict that a compromise will be found. Consultancy group Eurasia says: \u201cSensitive to union pressure, the government is likely to compromise on most of striking oil workers\u2019 pay demands. In the coming days oil production is likely to partially recover from its initial drop as non-striking staff is redistributed and inventories drawn upon. Two of Europe\u2019s better known lager brands are changing hands, as part of the latest mega-deal in the brewing industry. Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev is selling Peroni and Grolsch to Japan\u2019s Asahi (the firm behind Super Dry beer), to help smooth its takeover of SAB Miller. London craft brewer Meantime is also being sold to Asahi, less than a year after SAB snapped up the fast-growing company... More here: Sterling crisis, what sterling crisis? The pound has gained almost half a cent this morning to $1.4319, a one-week high. This follows a new opinion poll, giving the Remain campaign a nine point lead in June\u2019s in-out EU referendum. It\u2019s a telephone poll too, which are seen as more accurate (or possibly \u2018less inaccurate\u2019 would be safer) The FTSE 100 has just hit its highest level of the year, up 42 points at 6395. Precious metal prices are rising this morning too. Gold has gained 1% to $1,246 per ounce, while silver has jumped by 3% to a 10-month high. Again, that\u2019s partly due to the weakening US dollar. It has lost ground against most commodity-linked currencies today, reflecting the recovery in the oil price. European stock markets are rising at the start of trading, following Asia\u2019s lead. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 23 points, or 0.4%, to 6377 points. Mining stocks are packing the list of top risers, with Anglo American up 4% and Fresnillo and Glencore both gaining 3%. That\u2019s partly because the US dollar is weaker this morning, which pushes up commodity prices. Investors are also welcoming today\u2019s recovery in the oil price, as Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale explains: Brent crude at $40 per baarrel has done a good job of rejecting the notion that without production cuts it\u2019s going to hell in a hand basket. Unless we can un-invent the technology gains of the last few years we won\u2019t see dramatic upside and if the upshot is that oil prices settle into a range and better still, the correlation between non oil-producing countries currencies and the price of oil falls away, then that\u2019s even better. In the meantime, the oil market\u2019s willingness to get back to business as usual has been greeted by a loud cry of \u2018Party On, Dudes\u2019 in equity markets. An \u2018excellent\u2019 film reference from Kit... Yesterday\u2019s oil price slide has been completely wiped out: The recovery in the oil price has helped to drive stock markets higher in Asia. Japan\u2019s Nikkei led the way with a 3.7% rally, helped by the yen weakening against the US dollar (good news for Japanese exporters). That wipes out yesterday\u2019s selloff, when investors sold heavily following the huge earthquakes that killed at least 42 people and shuttered factories. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/500 index gained 1%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng finished 0.8% higher, and there were small gains in Shanghai too. This pushed the MSCI index of Asian markets to its highest level since last November. Asian investors were also cheered by the sight of the US stock market rallying last night. Hiroki Allen, of Superfund Securities Japan says: \u201cThe effects of the Dow reaching a nine-month high created a buying trend that helped lift the Nikkei today.\u201d The oil price is rallying this morning as world markets put the debacle of Sunday\u2019s Opec meeting behind them. Brent crude has risen to $43.23, up 0.75%, adding to last night\u2019s late rally. US crude oil is up almost 1%, back over $40. The rally appears to be driven by industrial action in Kuwait, where oil workers have been on strike since Sunday in a protest against public sector reforms which will cut their earnings. The walkout has slashed Kuwait\u2019s output by 60%, or 1.7 million barrels per day -- effectively eliminating the surplus crude in world markets. This has taken traders\u2019 minds off the deadlock between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which scuppered attempts to freeze output last weekend. Ironically, Kuwait\u2019s oil workers have done what the oil ministers and governors of Opec failed to achieve. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today, we get a new healthcheck on economic confidence in Europe\u2019s largest economy, and hear from the UK\u2019s top central banker. Germany ZEW index, released at 10am BST, is expected to show that economic sentiment among German investors and analysts rose this month, following the recent recovery in the markets. That will help set the scene for the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, will give his own view of the general economic outlook this afternoon. He\u2019s testifying to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee from 3.30pm. On the agenda: China\u2019s econony, the risks posed by Britain\u2019s EU referendum, and the revelations in the Panama Papers. On the corporate front, we\u2019ll get results from Goldman Sachs at 12.30pm BST. The Wall Street titan is tipped to post lower revenues and profits, as IB Times explains: The bank, which recently agreed to pay out over $5 billion to settle allegations related to the sale of subprime mortgage to investors between 2005 and 2007, is also forecast to report a 36.6 percent year-on-year drop in revenue, to $6.73 billion in the first three months of 2016 from $10.6 billion. Goldman\u2019s pretax profit is also expected to take a hit and is likely to drop to $1.87 billion from $3.93 billion in the first quarter of 2015. We also get some new US construction data at 1.30pm. That\u2019ll show how many new housing permits were granted last month, and how many actually started being built. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

charges Google with abusing market dominance of Android</a></h2> <p>Google found itself under fire again on Wednesday from EU antitrust regulators who say it abused the dominant position of its Android mobile operating system, a move which could hit a key money-spinner for the company.</p> <p>The charges by the European Commission open up a second battle with the world\u2019s most popular

searches at the expense of rival products, a case which has dragged on since late 2010 and marked by three failed attempts to resolve the issues.</p> <p>The stakes are higher in the Android case for

                "bodyText":"An opening rise on Wall Street and a revival in the oil price took some of the worry out of European markets, which shook off their early uncertainty. But the gains were hardly substantial and with oil producers unable to agree a cap on output, Greece back on the agenda, and the latest European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, investors remained cautious. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 4.91 points or 0.08% higher at 6410.26 after spending most of the day in negative territory Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.69% to 10,421.29 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.56% at 4591.92 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.14% to 18,658.36 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.96% at 9147.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.63% to 582.51 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 50 points or 0.3% higher. Meanwhile Brent crude is up 1.5% at $44.7 a barrel. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over to Greece and there are some signs of optimism ahead of this week\u2019s eurogroup meeting and amid talk of a second get-together next week: Although: And here\u2019s that recent jump in the oil price: Oil is now in positive territory after its earlier falls, in the wake of the smaller than expected rise in US crude stocks. There is also unsubstantiated talk of another meeting of producers within weeks to discuss an output freeze again, despite the failure of the weekend\u2019s meeting to reach any agreement. Brent is now up 0.18% at $44.11 a barrel. David Morrison, market strategist at Spreadco, said: Oil bounced off its lows following the latest inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). This showed a smaller-than-expected build in stockpiles, and a reduction from the previous week. Crude was lower in early trade today on the news that a strike by Kuwaiti oil workers had come to an end. The strike began on Sunday, coinciding with the breakdown of talks between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to freeze output. There was additional downside pressure on prices due to data from the American Petroleum Institute which showed that US inventories rose by 3.1 million barrels on expectations of a 2.4 million barrel increase. There\u2019s a real tug-of-war going on now between bulls and bears with the line in the sand being $40 for front-month WTI. So far the bulls are winning as a pile of negative news has failed to derail a rally which took hold in mid-February. This has been driven by hopes of an output freeze, dollar weakness and a suggestion that the supplies may come back into line with demand sooner than previously anticipated. But efforts to push WTI much beyond $42.50 have failed so far and it could be that the upside momentum is fading. If so, then a retest of $36 looks possible, particularly if more signs appear of a slowdown in global growth. US crude oil stocks rose by 2.1m barrels last week to 538.61m, lower than the 2.4m increase expected by analysts. But gasoline stocks fell by 110,000 barrels compared to a forecast 1.2m decline. Gasoline demand over the past four weeks was up 3.9% from a year ago. Stockpiles of distillate, which includes diesel and heating oil, fell by 3.6m barrels compared to expectations of a 304,000 increase. After weak US housing starts data on Tuesday came signs that the market may not be that bad after all. Existing home sales jumped 5.1% in March to a better than expected 5.33m units. Analysts had expected an increase of 3.5%, and is a vast improvement on the 7.3% drop seen in February (itself revised down from the original 7.1% decline). The rise from March last year was 1.5%. Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors which released the figures, said: Closings came back in force last month as a greater number of buyers \u2013 mostly in the Northeast and Midwest \u2013 overcame depressed inventory levels and steady price growth to close on a home. Buyer demand remains sturdy in most areas this spring and the mid-priced market is doing quite well. However, sales are softer both at the very low and very high ends of the market because of supply limitations and affordability pressures. It\u2019s proving to be a bit of a mixed day on the markets. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up just 14 points in early trading, with Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 also marginally higher. German and French markets are also a few points better off but in the UK, the FTSE 100 has slipped 19 points or 0.3%. Meanwhile oil has come back from its worst levels, but Brent crude is still down 1.7i% at $43.28 a barrel as the Kuwait strike ended and attention turned back to the lack of agreement among oil producersat the weekend to cap output. Later come the latest US weekly crude inventories data. Back with the speech by MPC member Ian McCafferty, and a former member is not impressed: Thursday\u2019s meeting of the European Central Bank may not be as exciting as the March gathering, when interest rates were cut further and its bond buying programme was expanded. That is the view of Mads Koefoed of Saxo Bank, who says: [The] meeting of the governing council looks to be a sleepy affair with not much new coming to the surface. We may get some additional details on the corporate sector purchase programme (part of the \u20ac80bn monthly purchases), but otherwise the stage is set for Draghi to reiterate that the ECB stands ready to combat low inflation while expressing confidence in the measures announced last month. The ECB meeting always has the potential to be a market-mover, but this particular one looks destined to be a non-event. Will Draghi surprise? Again? On Brexit he said: Very recently there have been some signs that increased uncertainty linked to the outcome of the EU referendum to be held on 23 June may weigh on investment in coming months, such that we may see a slight softening in GDP growth through the summer, but our central projection for demand growth remains one of \u2018steady as she goes\u2019. Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty has said he will vote to raise rates again at some point, and there was no guarantee future rises would be gradual and limited. But he did not know when rates might rise due to the current uncertain economic outlook. In a speech at the Bank, he said: On the basis of our current central outlook for the UK economy, I still anticipate having to return to a vote to tighten monetary policy at some stage, although I cannot offer a firm date as to when that might occur \u2013 the uncertainty surrounding the evolution of the economy over the coming months is particularly acute at the moment. As a result, the long-standing guidance from the Monetary Policy Committee that we expect to raise interest rates in a gradual and limited fashion is not a promise \u2013 the actual path of monetary policy will, of course, depend on the performance of the economy. McCafferty voted to raise rates last August, and finally came round to the consensus view that they should be left unchanged in February. He warned that wage growth was being pushed down by low headline inflation, but could quickly begin rising once prices started going up again. Greece should not need extra measures to complete the bailout review with its lenders, according to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, although he admitted that the EU and IMF may have differing assessments about the state of the country\u2019s economy. Greece\u2019s Kathimerini reports: \u201cWe, as the Commission, are of the opinion that our figures are right and there is no need for contingency measures,\u201d Juncker said in an interview with euro2day.gr financial website made public Wednesday. \u201cMy impression is that the IMF does not believe in our figures,\u201d he added. The Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) is expected to announce on Thursday that the 2015 primary surplus was between 1.1 and 1.2 billion euros, or 0.6 to 0.7 percent of GDP. According to sources, the European Commission\u2019s statistical arm, Eurostat, has already rubber-stamped the data. IMF calculations, on the other hand, are based on the Fund\u2019s forecast that Greece produced a 0.5 percent of GDP deficit last year. \u201cWe have to wait for the figures to be published by Eurostat on Thursday,\u201d Juncker said. Asked about the implications of the differences between the EU and the IMF, Juncker said the two would have to \u201cbridge the gap.\u201d \u201cIf others are of the opinion that contingency measures are a way out of a situation and if these measures are proposed then we are ready to assess them,\u201d he said, adding that this would have to occur \u201cin close cooperation with the Greek government.\u201d In the same interview, the head of the Commission also criticized fresh speculation of a Greek exit from the eurozone. \u201cI don\u2019t think for one second that it would be wise and intelligent to restart this debate. Grexit did not happen and will not happen,\u201d Juncker said. Ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting on Thursday, something to cheer up president Mario Draghi. The ECB, Draghi in particular, has been criticised by a number of German bigwigs, notably finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble although he was later defended by the Bundesbank. Now another politician has come to his defence, reports Reuters: German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel leapt to the defense of the European Central Bank on Wednesday, saying it was time to stop bashing the bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, and instead up to governments to agree on measures to boost growth. Members of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives have complained loudly in recent weeks that the low-interest rate policies of the ECB are creating a \u201cgaping hole\u201d in savers\u2019 finances as returns have dropped. Some conservatives have called for the next ECB president to come from Germany. \u201cThis game of ECB bad guy - this must come to an end,\u201d Gabriel told a news conference in Berlin, the main highlight of which became his defense of the ECB rather than the advertised focus on growth forecasts. Gabriel is leader of Germany\u2019s centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), the junior coalition partner of Merkel\u2019s conservatives. \u201cIf you engage in the debate, you quickly realise that the problem is not the ECB and Mr Draghi but rather the lack of willingness to give up a focus purely on austerity,\u201d he said. A quick recap. The European Union has opened a new front against Google, accusing the software giant of harming competition in the mobile sector. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has said Google is harming innovation by forcing mobile operators to include its applications in return for access to its Play Store, and offering financial inducements. Google has denied the charge, insisting that Android is free and open source. Economists fear that Britain\u2019s jobs recovery is bottoming out, after the unemployment total jumped by 21,000. The claimant count also rose, while the jobless rate remains at 5.1%. Uncertainty over the EU Referendum outcome in June may be partly to blame, as firms cut back on investment. Financial markets have dipped, following recent solid gains. China led the way, with shares sliding on fears of a clampdown on credit. The oil price has fallen, after refinery workers in Kuwait ended a strike. Brent crude is down 1.5% at $43.38 per barrel, on fears that the oil glut will worsen. Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi has admitted manipulating test data to overstate the fuel efficiency of 625,000 cars. The EC\u2019s move has been welcomed by Fairsearch, a group of search services which brought the initial complaint against Google. Reuters has the details: FairSearch, the lead complainant, said Google had launched Android as an open source project, but was now hindering the development of versions that might lead to new operating systems able to compete with Android. This is the issue of \u2018forking\u2019, where a piece of software splits off into different versions. It\u2019s one of the reasons that open source software has been so successful over the last couple of decades, with developers creating new code which is then released back to the community. Today\u2019s complaint, though, claims that Google forces phone makers to enter into an \u201cAnti-Fragmentation Agreement\u201d that commits it not to sell devices running on Android forks. That prevents rival versions of Android springing up, critics argue. Google has swiftly responded to the European Commission\u2019s charges, insisting that Android is a \u201cfree and open-source operating system.\u201d It also denies forcing mobile phone makers to give its applications unfair treatment, as the EC claims today. Kent Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel, says: \u201cOur partner agreements are entirely voluntary,\u201d \u201cWe look forward to working with the European Commission to demonstrate the careful way we\u2019ve designed the Android model in a way that\u2019s good for competition and for consumers.\u201d Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 news story about the EC\u2019s latest clash with Google, which broke an hour ago. EU charges Google with abusing market dominance of Android Google found itself under fire again on Wednesday from EU antitrust regulators who say it abused the dominant position of its Android mobile operating system, a move which could hit a key money-spinner for the company. The charges by the European Commission open up a second battle with the world\u2019s most popular Internet search engine, putting it at risk of hefty fines and radical changes to its business practices. Google is already facing EU charges of promoting its own shopping service in Internet searches at the expense of rival products, a case which has dragged on since late 2010 and marked by three failed attempts to resolve the issues. The stakes are higher in the Android case for Google which made about $11 billion from ad sales on Android phones with Google apps such as Maps, Search and Gmail last year. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. \u201cA competitive mobile Internet sector is increasingly important for consumers and businesses in Europe. \u201cBased on our investigation thus far, we believe that Google\u2019s behavior denies consumers a wider choice of mobile apps and services and stands in the way of innovation by other players.\u201d It said about 80 percent of smart mobile devices in Europe and in the world run on Android, the mobile operating system developed by Google. Google has breached EU antitrust rules, the Commision alleges, by requiring manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and Google\u2019s Chrome browser and preventing manufacturers from selling mobile devices running on competing operating systems based on the Android open source code. It is also charged with giving financial incentives to manufacturers and network operators to pre-install exclusively Google search on devices. The Commission\u2019s case against Google is online, here: Antitrust: Commission sends Statement of Objections to Google on Android operating system and applications You cannot use Google\u2019s Play Store to buy another app store, Vestager points out. So it becomes quite tricky to find another shop to do your shopping. Google\u2019s success partly comes from making applications that are popular with many consumers, she continues, but it isn\u2019t allowed to abuse that position. Commissioner Vestager repeats that Google has hurt competition by forcing mobile phone makers to install its search applications and Chrome browser, in return for access to its Play Store. If you want innovation to happen, here should be an incentive to innovate, she says. One of the best motivations is to be able to present your innovations, your services to potential customers. That is what is at stake. Maybe it has become too difficult, or impossibe, for other search machines and other app stores to present themselves to the consumer Q: Why is the Commission not concerned about Apple\u2019s iPhone? Apple doesn\u2019t licence its operating system to other phone makers, Margrethe Vestager replies. Q: What remedy must Google provide? Could it just be a change of contract, or will Google need to make technical changes? The remedy is simple - to stop prices that are damaging innovation and competition, Vestager says. Yesterday, Canada closed an ant-trust investigation against Google, so why does Europe have a different view. asks Politico\u2019s Nicholas Hirst. Q: Is it targeting Google as part of its push to create a digital single market? Margrethe Vestager insists that the EU doesn\u2019t have a grudge against any particular company. We are responding to complaints. Q: How much damage has Google caused to the European economy? It\u2019s hard to say, Vestager replies, but the impact goes beyond simply the search area. It may be wide-ranging - stifling competition and hurting innovation in the wider tech space. We all want an innovative economy, she adds, but what\u2019s the point if companies don\u2019t have a level playing field? Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is briefing reporters in Brussels now. She says Google has played \u201cunjustified restrictions\u201d on mobile manufacturers, meaning some have chosen not to use applications from rival software makers. The European Commission claims that Google is breaking EU law by forcing mobile phone makers who use Android to give preferential treatment to Google applications. In today\u2019s Statement of Objections, the Commission alleges that Google is: requiring manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and Google\u2019s Chrome browser and requiring them to set Google Search as default search service on their devices, as a condition to license certain Google proprietary apps; preventing manufacturers from selling smart mobile devices running on competing operating systems based on the Android open source code; giving financial incentives to manufacturers and mobile network operators on condition that they exclusively pre-install Google Search on their devices. Newsflash: The European Commission has formally charged Google with breaking competition rules over its Android mobile operating system. Competition chief Margrethe Vestager has tweeted the news (from an iPhone) Here\u2019s our economics correspondent, Phillip Inman, on today\u2019s jobs report: The number of people out of work in Britain increased for the first time in seven months in February. In a signal that the referendum vote in June is having an impact on the economy, the latest labour market report showed that the unemployment total rose by 21,000 in the three months to February to 1.7 million. This was the first increase since last August but left the headline unemployment rate unchanged at 5.1%. The claimant count, which measures people receiving out of work benefits, jumped by 6,700 in March. This is also the first increase since August 2015. In a further blow to the government\u2019s efforts to keep the economy growing strongly, wage growth including bonuses fell from 2.1% in January to 1.8% . The measure of wages excluding bonuses remained at 2.2%..... More here: John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says the rise in unemployment shows that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s EU referendum are hurting the economy: \u201cThe UK economy has been a great job creating machine for most of the past three years, but the latest data suggest that this has levelled off over the past three months.... These latest data are consistent with other evidence that UK growth slowed somewhat during the first quarter of 2016, reflecting a more fragile global economy and uncertainty related to the EU Referendum outcome in June. Time will tell whether this proves to be a temporary blip or a more pronounced slowdown, although our main scenario is still that the UK will achieve GDP growth of around 2% this year with the unemployment rate remaining around 5%.\u201d Professor Geraint Johnes of Lancaster University Management School and The Work Foundation also believes Britain\u2019s labour market is slowing. He says: \u201cUnemployment is 21000 up on the quarter, but employment is also 20000 up, with a fall in labour market inactivity. Amongst employees in employment, there has been a fall in full-time numbers of 34000 and a rise in part-time of 11000 - suggesting something of a slowdown. The big news, though, is the fall in wage growth - which worsened in February. For total pay on the single month measure, this is down from 2.6% to 1.1%. The big slowdown here is in finance. Pay in construction is still steaming ahead, at 8.6% over the course of the year. This chart shows how average earnings growth has come off the boil recently: Today\u2019s report also shows the stark regional imbalances across Britain\u2019s jobs market: Mariano Mamertino, economist at job site Indeed, fears that the UK\u2019s referendum on European Union membership has pushed the unemployment total up: Mamertino says: \u201cModest though it is, the increase in unemployment is a deeply worrying sign that the UK economy\u2019s ability to create new jobs is running out of steam. \u201cUnemployment remains at a historically low level, but the lengthening dole queue is a warning of trouble ahead. \u201cThe combination of strengthening economic headwinds, and the political uncertainty triggered by the Brexit referendum, is having a dramatic cooling effect on employers\u2019 appetite to hire. \u201cAt the end of March, just a month on from the confirmation of the Brexit referendum, the number of live job postings by UK employers on our site had fallen across all 13 major sectors. \u201cThis is in sharp contrast to February, when job postings increased across the board. Stephen Crabb, the new Work and Pensions Secretary, has commented on today\u2019s jobs report (but not mentioned the jump in unemployment). \u201cWe remain in a position of strength, with a record employment rate, wages continuing to grow steadily and three-quarters of a million vacancies available in the labour market. \u201cWork is essential in transforming the lives of the most disadvantaged people in society and is at the heart of our welfare reforms. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring that everyone across the country benefits from our strong economy and the opportunities this brings.\u201d The rise in unemployment in the last quarter may show that Britain\u2019s jobs recovery is bottoming out. Nick Palmer, statistician at the Office for National Statistics, says: \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to be certain but, with unemployment up for the first time since mid-2015, and employment seeing its slowest rise since that period, it\u2019s possible that recent improvements in the labour market may be easing off.\u201d The employment rate has strengthened pretty steadily for the last four years, but has been hovering around 74% since the last quarter of 2015: The UK labour market appears to be \u2018softening\u2019, warns Duncan Weldon, the head of research at Resolution Group. Marc Ostwald, analyst at ADM Investor Services, says today\u2019s data is \u201cvery poor\u201d The number of people in work across Britain has also gone up. The employment total rose by 20,000 in the last quarter, to 31.41m, and is 360,000 higher than a year ago. The number of people out of work in Britain has risen for the first time in seven months. The latest labour market report, just released, shows that the unemployment total rose by 21,000 in the December-February quarter to 1.70 million. It\u2019s the first rise since last May-July. That leaves the headline unemployment rate unchanged at 5.1%. The claimant count, which measures people receiving unemployment benefit, has jumped by 6,700 in March. This is also the first increase since August 2015. In another blow.... average wages including bonuses rose by just 1.8% during the quarter, down from 2.1% a month earlier. That may be due to a dropoff in City bonuses. Excluding bonuses, wage growth were unchanged at 2.2%. Reaction to follow..... Japanese carmaker Mitsubishi has just admitted that some employees have falsified data on emission tests to improve its vehicles\u2019 fuel economy. In an obvious echo of the Volkswagen emissions scandal, Mitsubishi says that the the false tests involves 625,000 cars, including some supplied to Nissan. Nissan discovered the issue and the two companies are discussing compensation, according to Bloomberg. The pound has dipped a little this morning, down 0.15% against the US dollar at $1.4370. This chart from Bloomberg\u2019s David Ingles, showing how sterling has already weakened against most major currencies this year, as the EU referendum casts a shadow of uncertainty. There\u2019s no escape from Brexit fears. Overnight, eight former US Treasury secretaries have warned that Britain would become a \u2018less relevant and less significant economy\u2019 if it leaves the European Union. European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is expected to announce new antitrust charges against Google at 10.30am BST (11.30am in Belgium). Brussels correspondents will be busy! Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, explains why ARM\u2019s shares are bucking the downturn: Arm is now shipping more than half of its chips to non-mobile markets, meaning the company\u2019s fortunes cannot simply be linked directly to the likes of Apple anymore. That\u2019s just as well for Arm, as it looks like shipments of Apple\u2019s iPhones nosedived in the first quarter. Slowing smartphone sales, particularly in China, don\u2019t seem to be as much as a problem as many would have thought. Arm seems well placed to ride out any relative decline in growth for Apple and other smartphone makers as it\u2019s good at innovating \u2013 vital within a fast-changing market.\u201d The car industry\u2019s test-rigging scandal may be deepening. Mitsubishi, the Japanese automaker, has found evidence of problems with its fuel economy test results. A spokesman says: \u201cOne of our models was found to have failed part of a fuel economy test.\u201d Further details are expected shortly.... Shares in Mitsubishi have tanked by 17%: Europe\u2019s main stock markets are all down this morning: Shares in ARM, the UK semiconductor maker, have jumped 2.6% after beating City expectations. ARM reported a 14% jump in profits this morning, as it continued to outperform despite concerns that demand for Apple\u2019s iPhone is falling. The London stock market has opened lower, with the FTSE 100 losing 26 points to 6377. Mining firms leading the fallers, with Anglo American shedding 2% and Glencore down 1.5%. They would suffer if China\u2019s central bank did crack down on credit, as Ma Jun hinted overnight. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets calls it a \u201cmild retreat\u201d from yesterday\u2019s first foray above 6400 points: Note renewed concern about China, with stocks sharply lower on suggestions the People\u2019s Bank of China has less stimulus appetite thanks to an improving outlook all the while worries grow about the country\u2019s mounting bad debts. The mood in China\u2019s stock markets has turned rather sour today. The main Shanghai share index has fallen by 3% in a worrying late selloff, with every sector losing ground. The selloff may have been triggered by one of China\u2019s top central bank economists, Ma Jun. He told the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s official newspaper that monetary policymakers will rein in excessive borrowing by companies and individuals. Or as he put it: \u201cAside from continuing to support steady economic growth, future monetary policy will focus on guarding against macroeconomic risks, especially avoiding rapid growth in companies\u2019 leverage, and will also consider the impact of increased loans on the cost of living and real estate prices.\u201d Reuters has more details: China may be more cautious with future policy easing - Financial News Chinese credit has exploded in recent years, helping avoid the economy slowing sharply. Any tightening could have a significant impact on growth The oil price is in retreat this morning after Kuwaiti workers ended a three day strike. Brent crude has slumped by 2.5% already, down over $1 to $42.95 per barrel, as traders anticipate more oil flowing from Kuwait again. Workers had walked out on Sunday, protesting against austerity cutbacks that will hit their wages and benefits. It\u2019s not clear what concessions they have been handed, though, in return for ending their display of labour power. Associated Press has the details: The state-run Kuwait News Agency reported that the unions ended the strike by praising the country\u2019s ruling emir, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, and saying their action showed their \u201cability to affect the production process.\u201d The unions \u201centrusted his highness, the emir, (with) the protection of rights of the employees in the oil sector,\u201d the unions said, according to KUNA. It said workers wouldn\u2019t be disciplined for taking part in the strike. Adel al-Fadhel, a spokesman for the Kuwait Oil Company Workers\u2019 Union, confirmed workers would go back to work Wednesday. He said Sheikh Sabah spoke to the head of one of the unions Tuesday by telephone to assure his support for the workers. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to announce that the strike has succeeded in preserving the rights of the workers in the oil sector,\u201d al-Fadhel told The Associated Press. \u201cHis highness, the emir, intervened and guaranteed to preserve the rights of the workers according to the law.\u201d Around half of Kuwait\u2019s usual oil production had been taken offline by the strike, which helped drive oil prices higher on Monday and Tuesday. Now, though, traders can return to worrying about supply gluts, and Opec\u2019s seeming inability to do anything about it..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. Coming up today..... At 9.30am, the latest UK unemployment figures are released. Economists expect the UK jobless claimant count to fall by another 10,000 people, while the unemployment rate remains at 5.1%. But today\u2019s report may also show that wage growth remains lacklustre. Average earnings growth (ex-bonuses) is tipped to slow to 2.1%, from 2.2% a month ago. There may be drama in Brussels this morning, if the European Commission hits Google with anti-competitive charges concerning its Android mobile phone operating system. Margrethe Vestager, European competition commissioner, is expected to make the announcement today: Closer to home, the bosses of the Port Talbot steel plant in South Wales may announce a buyout plan for the site. This could ask employees to invest up to \u00a310,000 each, to help take the plant off Tata UK\u2019s hands. After hitting four-month highs yesterday, European markets are expected to dip at the start of trading: And we\u2019re getting corporate results from (among others), UK chipmaker ARM, pub chain Punch Taverns and builders group Travis Perkins.",

                "bodyText":"The International Energy Agency (IEA) said it expects the oversupplied oil market to rebalance by next year, as non-Opec production records its biggest decline in a generation. An oil glut has prompted a slump in crude prices from a peak of $115 (\u00a380) a barrel in June 2014, but the IEA executive director, Fatih Birol, said on Thursday that production outside tOpec would fall sharply this year, by almost 700,000 barrels a day. He expects oil markets, and prices, to rebalance at the turn of this year, or by 2017 at the latest. Brent crude, the global benchmark, increased to $45.92 a barrel, up 0.2% on the day, in early London trading. US crude recovered to $44.30, up 0.4% on the day. Birol said low oil prices had led to investment cuts of 40% over the past two years, especially in the US, Canada, Latin America and Russia. After meeting Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, Birol told reporters in Tokyo: \u201cThis year, we are expecting the biggest decline in non-Opec oil supply in the last 25 years, almost 700,000 barrels per day. At the same time, global demand growth is in a hectic pace, led by India, China and other emerging countries.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen we look at all the fundamentals \u2013 demand, supply and stocks \u2013 I have all the reasons to believe that in the absence of a major economic downturn we are going to see balance in the markets latest by 2017.\u201d Birol argued that conditions remained difficult for shale oil producers, despite a recovery in Brent oil prices to above $45 a barrel. \u201cI think $45 is a bit of a relief for all the oil producers around the world, but this is still far lower than to make the entire shale oil production profitable for the United States.\u201d However, Iran is determined to claw back market share after western sanctions were lifted in January, and reiterated plans to reach an output of 4m barrels a day.

As you know, we undertook extensive revisions to our remuneration policy in 2013 following consultations by the chair of our Remuneration Committee, Sir Philip Hampton, with our major shareholders, and that policy was overwhelmingly approved at our AGM in 2014. It is that policy that we are working to today.</p> <p> Volatile commodity markets and their effect on companies such as ours of course create a variety of remuneration outcomes. That is what our remuneration structures are designed for - to ensure appropriate alignment with shareholder interests, while also incentivising management through a balance between stretching management and making targets realistically achievable.</p> <p> There has to be a mixture of measures focused on financial and relative market performance as well as non-financial metrics for other critical work that drives longer-term strategic success. I believe that our remuneration policy does strike that balance. However, as is the case every three years, we will be taking a fresh look at the policy during the next 12 months in order to put it to a fresh round of consultation with shareholders, followed by a vote at next year\u2019s AGM.</p> <p> In the case of the remuneration outcomes for 2015 - without doubt a very tough year for us and for our shareholders - I would point out that our existing policy did result in the Chief Executive\u2019s variable pay being just one-fifth of the maximum achievable.

Continuing to push on the string of monetary policy to boost the Eurozone\u2019s flailing economy is not a sustainable way forward. The potential of monetary stimulus to restore inflation and growth is reaching its limits as more decisive measures such as \u2018helicopter money\u2019 are not yet on the ECB table. Moreover, the uncharted waters of \u201cQE infinity\u201d and negative rates could be hiding unintended negative consequences that no one can predict \u2013 the policies are after all called \u2018unconventional\u2019 for a reason. However, as Draghi pointed out in his press conference, the ECB is not alone in experimenting with these measures. On the contrary, the ECB has been late to the \u2018QE party\u2019 and in efforts to loosen policy more generally. Additionally, given its mandate to pursue price stability and contribute to the EU\u2019s objective of balanced economic growth, the ECB cannot be blamed for loosening policy given the inadequate response when it comes to the other levers of economic management: fiscal policy and structural reforms. </p> <p>Looking ahead, Cebr expects the economic recovery in the Eurozone to continue to develop at an anaemic pace. While the ECB\u2019s stimulus measures will provide some relief for now, these policies will only work slowly in the absence of a supportive fiscal stance in those member states that can afford to do so within the Maastricht Treaty\u2019s fiscal rules.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5718dfc4e4b0e8c8aac09fa2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-21T14:15:25.693Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The ECB meeting was clearly dovish in tone, according to economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some ECB watchers today might regret that they did not enjoy one of the first sunny days of the year but stayed inside following a rather eventless, not to say dull, ECB press conference. As expected the ECB did not announce any new measures but sent a clear dovish signal, keeping the door open for additional easing in the future.</p> <p>All in all, there are two key take-aways from today\u2019s ECB meeting: first of all, the ECB is still on high alert and would be willing to implement even more stimulus if the recovery falters or low inflation leads to negative second round effects (even though it\u2019s unclear what these measures would really be). And, secondly, the ECB does not look willing at all to alter its monetary policies as a result of German criticism. German [criticism] has become a fact of life but it will not change the ECB\u2019s life.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5718dcefe4b01f52551dab6c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-21T14:06:01.592Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following Draghi\u2019s performance, the ECB has issued <strong><a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2016/html/pr160421_1.en.html\">more details of its corporate bond buying programme.</a></strong></p> <p>This will start in June and be carried out by six central banks, from Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy and Finland.</p> <p>Among the criteria for eligibility, the bonds must be denominated in euro, have a credit rating of at least BBB-, have a maturity of between six months and 30 years, be issued by a corporation established in the euro area but not be a credit institution.

Europe\u2019s confused response so far has risked worsening the problem, although there are tentative signs that the recent EU-Turkey deal has slowed migrant flows.<br></li> <li><strong>Brexit</strong>: The risks of the UK leaving the EU have increased over recent weeks\u2014chiefly because of a series of hits to the reputation for competence of the prime minister, David Cameron\u2014but we continue to expect the UK to vote \u201cremain\u201d in June.<br></li> <li><strong>Grexit</strong>: We expect Greece to leave the euro zone during our five-year forecast period. Grexit would represent a huge political failure for the bloc, with potentially destabilising consequences: the principle of irreversibility would have been shattered. <br></li> <li><strong>Monetary policy</strong>: A deepening reliance on accommodative monetary policy has been one of the hallmarks of the post-crisis period in Europe. This is creating its own challenges which the region is hard placed to address. <br></li> <li><strong>Productivity</strong>: The region faces an ongoing crisis of productivity which it needs to address if it is to deliver improved growth. <br></li> <li><strong>Regional security: </strong>Russia has become aggressively revisionist in the last several years, posing a challenge to the regional security architecture. <br></li> <li><strong>Populism</strong>: Populist movements have come to prominence in rich and poor countries alike, and the region will struggle to manage the implications of an erosion of post-war political structures and voting patterns.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Aengus Collins, Country Forecast Director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, warns that politicians are failing to tackle these crisis:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cPolicymakers appear increasingly unable to understand and respond to the desires of their electorates. This is leading to voting patterns that could have lasting destabilising effects.</p> <p>Nowhere are people more jittery about electoral risk right now than in the UK. We\u2019re sticking with our years-old forecast that in June the UK will vote to remain in the EU\u2014the pull of the status quo will strengthen as the vote draws closer and the risks of Brexit crystallise\u2014but all the momentum has been with the \u201cleave\u201d campaign in recent weeks and nothing can be taken for granted.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And on monetary policy, the EIU warns:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The idea that the ECB can boost the euro zone singlehandedly bumped up against the law of diminishing returns some time ago.

                "bodyText":"Germany has responded to the earlier comments from ECB president Mario Draghi. Draghi was countering an attack from German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble who said record low rates were causing \u201cextraordinary problems\u201d for German banks and pensioners . Draghi defended the ECB\u2019s policies and said, \u201cWe obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent as stated by the law.\u201d In turn German chancellor Angela Merkel said it was legitimate for Germans to discuss how far interest rates had fallen but \u201cthat shouldn\u2019t be confused with interference in the independent policy of the ECB, which I support.\u201d \u201cThe ECB is is independent in its policies,\u201d she told reporters while on a visit to the Netherlands, according to news agency Reuters. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Legal and General Investment Management, which owns 2.9% of Anglo American, is one of the investors which voted against the company\u2019s remuneration report. It said: The rationale for this instruction centred on the lack of discretion exercised by the Remuneration Committee to scale back Long Term Incentive Awards (LTIP) to Executive Directors at a low share price. These grants are made as a multiple of salary and have the effect of awarding a higher number of shares which could lead to windfall gains in the future. This is not in line with best practice and is stated in our voting policy. At the AGM, approximately 42% of investors opposed this item. We will continue to engage with the company giving constructive feedback on their remuneration structure ahead of the binding policy vote next year. Here\u2019s our report on the investor rebellion at Anglo American: With the recent gains on markets it was probably no surprise that investors have decided to pause for some reflection. The European Central Bank meeting with no change to policy but promises of further action if necessary was seen as a little inconclusive for market sentiment, while in the UK, retail sales and public borrowing figures both disappointed. Analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: After the recent run of gains for equities, it was probably time for the markets to pause for breath and that certainly appears to have come about during today\u2019s session. Oil prices are edging back a little, but more significantly for London stocks was the news that UK retail sales came in far lower than had been forecast. This seems to have set the pace for the morning session and the fact that Mario Draghi appeared to lack any urgency in his statement meant there was little left for markets to cheer, although we have seen some signs of bargain hunting in the last few minutes of trade. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 28.82 points or 0.45% to 6381.44 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.14% to 10,435.73 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.2% lower at 4582.83 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished up 0.4% at 18,732.96 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.55% at 9197.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.78% to 598.72 on hopes of a deal between the country and its creditors as the Eurogroup meets on Friday On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 58 points or 0.3%. In his opening remarks to Anglo American\u2019s annual meeting - just released by the company - chairman Sir John Parker has defended its pay policies: We are of course well aware of the strength of feeling among some investors about the levels of executive remuneration in many large companies and the mechanisms that determine them. As you know, we undertook extensive revisions to our remuneration policy in 2013 following consultations by the chair of our Remuneration Committee, Sir Philip Hampton, with our major shareholders, and that policy was overwhelmingly approved at our AGM in 2014. It is that policy that we are working to today. Volatile commodity markets and their effect on companies such as ours of course create a variety of remuneration outcomes. That is what our remuneration structures are designed for - to ensure appropriate alignment with shareholder interests, while also incentivising management through a balance between stretching management and making targets realistically achievable. There has to be a mixture of measures focused on financial and relative market performance as well as non-financial metrics for other critical work that drives longer-term strategic success. I believe that our remuneration policy does strike that balance. However, as is the case every three years, we will be taking a fresh look at the policy during the next 12 months in order to put it to a fresh round of consultation with shareholders, followed by a vote at next year\u2019s AGM. In the case of the remuneration outcomes for 2015 - without doubt a very tough year for us and for our shareholders - I would point out that our existing policy did result in the Chief Executive\u2019s variable pay being just one-fifth of the maximum achievable. In addition, his salary was frozen, as it was for all senior management. Anglo American plans to launch a review of executive pay, Reuters is reporting, after the revolt against the \u00a33.4m pay packet awarded to chief executive Mark Cutifani. The exact numbers show 41.64% of shareholders who submitted votes ahead of the annual meeting opposed the remuneration report. Last year 94% voted in favour of the report. The vote is, as usual, non-binding but will prove severely embarrassing for the company. Anglo says the full voting result will be released on Friday. Of those shareholders who submitted votes ahead of the annual meeting, 41% were opposed to the remuneration report with 58% in favour. Earlier investment group Hermes said it would not back the pay report. Director Bruce Duguid said: We are concerned by the unusually high number of shares issued to directors under its long term incentive plan. This is roughly triple the number of prior years, as it is calculated by dividing the salary of each director by the prevailing share price, which was particularly low at the time of the award following a sharp fall over the year. In the light of the value creation experienced by long term owners in recent years, we are concerned about the resulting potential future reward to directors. Elsewhere, the new \u201cshareholder spring\u201d seems to be continuing. After nearly 60% of investors voted against Bob Dudley\u2019s pay package at BP, Reuters is reporting that Anglo American has said that partial voting results show that 41% of shareholders have voted against its remuneration report at the mining group\u2019s annual meeting. Chief executive Mark Cutifani is in line for a \u00a33.4m pay deal. Earlier, just as ECB president Mario Draghi was getting started, over in the US the Labor Department announced that the number of jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week. Initial benefit claims dropped by 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 247,000, the lowest reading since November 1973, compared to expectations of a rise to around 263,000. Meanwhile oil is on the slide again. After early gains, a rebound in the value of the dollar has seen Brent crude fall 1.5% to $45.08 a barrel. Back with the UK, and the Treasury has revealed the impact of falling oil prices on the North Sea sector. Scotland editor Severin Carrell reports: The North Sea oil and gas sector raised only \u00a335m last year following the collapse in global oil prices and further weakening the Treasury\u2019s books, the latest HMRC data shows. Provisional HMRC data for 2015/16 puts total petroleum revenue tax income at minus \u00a3503m \u2013 the first time PRT income has been negative for a full year, with operators able to deduct various allowances or a deductible expense for corporation tax and the supplementary charge. In 2008/09, the Treasury raised \u00a32.8bn from PRT. Offshore corporation tax income was also at its lowest in decades, at \u00a3538m compared to peaks of \u00a39.8bn in 2008/09 and \u00a38.8bn in 2011/12. These figures, which exclude Treasury income from the supplementary charge or costs to the Treasury of other North Sea tax deductions or allowances for decommissioning or investment, suggest the sector\u2019s days as a cash cow are now over. It also confirms challenging questions for Scotland in the ongoing debate over independence. Still with the eurozone, and consumer confidence rose slightly more than expected in April after three consecutive months of decline. According to an initial estimate from the European Commission, it edged up 0.4 points to -9.3 compared to expectations of a figure of -9.5. For the 28 member European Union, consumer sentiment increased by 0.5 points to -6.8. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: A modicum of good news for Eurozone growth hopes as consumer confidence edged up in April having fallen over the previous three months to be at a 15-month low in March. The improvement was small, but at least it was a tiny step in the right direction. Any sign that consumer confidence may be starting to turn around is to be welcomed as on the face of it, consumers perhaps offer the Eurozone the best hope for growth at the moment - the fundamentals still look reasonable for consumer spending in the Eurozone with deflation/negligible inflation boosting purchasing power and labour markets generally improved. Commenting on the criticism of loose monetary policies from some quarters - notably Germany of course - economists at the Cebr said: Cebr recognises that there are important risks associated with an over-reliance on loose monetary policy. Continuing to push on the string of monetary policy to boost the Eurozone\u2019s flailing economy is not a sustainable way forward. The potential of monetary stimulus to restore inflation and growth is reaching its limits as more decisive measures such as \u2018helicopter money\u2019 are not yet on the ECB table. Moreover, the uncharted waters of \u201cQE infinity\u201d and negative rates could be hiding unintended negative consequences that no one can predict \u2013 the policies are after all called \u2018unconventional\u2019 for a reason. However, as Draghi pointed out in his press conference, the ECB is not alone in experimenting with these measures. On the contrary, the ECB has been late to the \u2018QE party\u2019 and in efforts to loosen policy more generally. Additionally, given its mandate to pursue price stability and contribute to the EU\u2019s objective of balanced economic growth, the ECB cannot be blamed for loosening policy given the inadequate response when it comes to the other levers of economic management: fiscal policy and structural reforms. Looking ahead, Cebr expects the economic recovery in the Eurozone to continue to develop at an anaemic pace. While the ECB\u2019s stimulus measures will provide some relief for now, these policies will only work slowly in the absence of a supportive fiscal stance in those member states that can afford to do so within the Maastricht Treaty\u2019s fiscal rules. The ECB meeting was clearly dovish in tone, according to economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank: Some ECB watchers today might regret that they did not enjoy one of the first sunny days of the year but stayed inside following a rather eventless, not to say dull, ECB press conference. As expected the ECB did not announce any new measures but sent a clear dovish signal, keeping the door open for additional easing in the future. All in all, there are two key take-aways from today\u2019s ECB meeting: first of all, the ECB is still on high alert and would be willing to implement even more stimulus if the recovery falters or low inflation leads to negative second round effects (even though it\u2019s unclear what these measures would really be). And, secondly, the ECB does not look willing at all to alter its monetary policies as a result of German criticism. German [criticism] has become a fact of life but it will not change the ECB\u2019s life. Following Draghi\u2019s performance, the ECB has issued more details of its corporate bond buying programme. This will start in June and be carried out by six central banks, from Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy and Finland. Among the criteria for eligibility, the bonds must be denominated in euro, have a credit rating of at least BBB-, have a maturity of between six months and 30 years, be issued by a corporation established in the euro area but not be a credit institution. Debt from corporations in the euro area whose ultimate parent companies are based elsewhere are also eligible if it meets the other criteria. Mario Draghi has just administered a very firm rebuke to his critics in general, and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble in particular. Most crucially, the ECB president has warned that those who endanger ECB independence are actually making Europe\u2019s economic problems worse. He swept aside the notion that German savers are the victims in the current crisis, blaming the media for not explaining how low inflation is helping savers. And he was adamant that the ECB will not be knocked off course, revealing that the governing council were unanimous in defending its independence today. As Draghi put it: We have a mandate to pursue price stability for the whole of the euro zone not only for Germany. We obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent as stated by the law.\u201d That\u2019s code for \u201cWolfgang, please don\u2019t claim we are causing \u2018enormous problems\u2019, there\u2019s a good chap\u201d. Draghi also tried to cool another discussion, about helicopter money, saying twice that it hadn\u2019t been discussed. And having left interest rates on hold today, Draghi\u2019s message to the eurozone was effectively \u2018trust us, it\u2019s working\u2019. Our policies work, they are effective. Just give them time to fully display their effects.\u201d And finally, Draghi gets the Brexit question. Q: Is the ECB worried that the UK\u2019s referendum over European Union membership will hurt the recovery? The discussion about Brexit has already had some significant consequences on markets, Draghi replies, such as the decline in the value of sterling. He won\u2019t speculate about the outcome of the vote on June 23, but says that ECB staff think there is only a \u201climited\u201d risk that it might endanger the eurozone recovery. Q: Are you worried that companies will stop investing because of the flow of criticism from Germany? A polite, lively debate may even be welcome, to help shape our policies, says Draghi. But criticisms of a certain type could be seen as endangering the independence of the ECB. Therefore, that can cause delays in investment, delays in taking risks. But we are independent, so we will continue with our policies. But the recovery will take longer if our independence is endangered, he concludes. Q: How are relations with Wolfgang Schauble, and do you accept his claim that the ECB has fuelled support for extremist parties in Germany? My discussions with Schauble have been very positive, fruitful.... and \u201cI would say quiet, and very friendly\u201d Draghi replies. And he rejects the claim that a non-Italian would be acting differently. His predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, recently said he would have taken exactly the same steps. Q: German citizens are seriously worried about their private pension schemes, as the yield on government bonds are so low. Did you discuss this, and what do you say to Germans? Yeah, we are familiar with these concerns, and we are watching it, Draghi replies briskly. It\u2019s evident that pension funds and insurance companies are challenged by low interest rates. And Draghi then takes another jab at his critics... By the way, I would urge all the actors in this sector to blame low interest rates for the cause of everything that has gone wrong in this sector. The US had low interest rate for much longer than Europe, he adds, without the same problems as in Europe. And real interest rates (adjusted for inflation) have been lower in the past. Explaining real rates to savers may be difficult... that\u2019s your job, I suggest, he concludes. Another slap to his German critics. Draghi is in a snappy mood today, repeating that the ECB\u2019s measures have supported growth in the eurozone. Indeed, they have been the only policy to support growth in the last four years (with rare exceptions). That\u2019s a second slap at Germany! But for sustainable growth, Europe also needs structural reforms and an appropriately supportive fiscal policies. That means growth-friendly government policies, including lower taxes, lower public expenditure, and more investment, Draghi insists. Q: Last month you suggests interest rates are unlikely to fall again. Has that position changed? Draghi says that the experience with negative interest rates has been largely positive so far. They haven\u2019t hurt banks\u2019 income, and they hasn\u2019t been a pass-through to customers. But the ECB is also awake to the added complexity that negative rates brings. Q: How concerned are you about the recent rise in the euro? As I\u2019ve said many times, the exchange rate is not a policy target, although it\u2019s an important factor in growth and inflation, Draghi says, The measures we took in March will be effective in avoiding \u2018second round effects\u2019 (pushing inflation rates even lower) Q: Are there any circumstances under which the ECB could consider helicopter money? Is it legal under EU law? We didn\u2019t discuss it, Draghi repeats firmly. Draghi then cites research showing that Eurozone GDP would be 1.6% lower if the ECB had not launched its stimulus measures. Inflation would be lower too. Mario Draghi has just robustly defended the ECB against critics of its stimulus packages. Q: Is Draghi concerned about criticism from German politicians* over its monetary policy? We have a mandate to implement monetary stability across the eurozone, not just Germany, Draghi replies, declaring: We obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent. He then reveals that the ECB\u2019s governing council discussed this issue today, and was unanimous in defending the independence of the ECB. Our politicie work, they are effective, just give them time to work, Draghi adds. And they would work faster if European politicians implemented structural reforms. * - this month, Germany\u2019s finance minister accused the ECB of fuelling the rise of euro-sceptic parties in Germany. Q: Has the ECB considered helicopter money this month? Draghi repeats his statement from last month (that helicopter money is an interesting idea that economists are looking at). We have not talked about it, he insists. Onto questions... Q: Can you give more details about the corporate bond-buying programme announced last month? Draghi says that all non-banks are eligible, including the parent companies of firms which own banks. Good summary: Draghi then give his own trumpet a little toot, saying the measures put in place since June 2014 have clearly helped the eurozone economy: And the ECB president concludes with his traditional call for eurozone governments to take structural reforms now, and implement the eurozone\u2019s stability pact. All countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies, he adds. Draghi says this every month, and it\u2019s not clear that European politicians are really paying attention: Sounding suitably cautious, Draghi says that the risks to Eurozone growth remain \u201ctilted to the downside\u201d. Inflation could turn negative again in the coming months, and uncertainties in the global economy are also holding back growth. But the ECB is still confident that inflation will then rise back toward the ECB\u2019s target. And he cites surveys showing that demand for bank lending is picking up. Draghi adds that it is essential to preserve \u201can appropriate degree of monetary accommodation\u201d for as long as needed. That\u2019s another hint that the ECB has more tools, if needed. Draghi says that broad financing conditions in the euro area have improved since the ECB announce its \u201ccomprehensive package of decisions taken in early March\u201d. Mario Draghi begins with a prepared statement as usual. He confirms that the ECB left interest rates unchanged, and immediately drops a hint that further cuts are possible! Draghi says: We continue to expect them [interest rates] to remain at present, or lower, levels for an extended period of time - and well past the horizon of asset purchases. Mario Draghi and colleagues have arrived, a few minutes late..... (when last happened, it emerged that they\u2019d got stuck in a lift!). Here\u2019s a live feed of Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, which starts in 5 minutes. I\u2019ve tried to embed it at the top of the blog too, so you might need to refresh this page. The sudden rise in the euro is a little curious, as every economist had expected the ECB to leave rates on hold. The euro is strengthening against the US dollar, now up 0.5% at $1.135 (from $1.130 this morning). That won\u2019t please Mario Draghi too much. Perhaps he\u2019ll manage to talk it down.... Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, says that the eurozone economy looks a bit less troubled than six weeks ago, at the last ECB meeting. \u201cAfter Draghi brought out the big guns last month, he was never realistically going to up the ante further on monetary easing in April. The modest recovery in the Eurozone\u2019s economic fortunes placed the ECB on somewhat firmer footing ahead of the decision. Lending conditions have improved in the bloc, business confidence seems to be climbing, and unemployment is falling. That\u2019s not to say the recovery is entrenched by any means. Deflationary pressures remain prominent, the euro has been strengthening, and the impact of the forthcoming EU referendum in Britain will no doubt cause some uncertainty. \u201cThe door is certainly not closed for further monetary stimulus, but given market scepticism about its long-term efficacy, it\u2019s likely Draghi will keep any further measures back for moments of future turmoil.\u201d Reminder: At the last ECB meeting, Mario Draghi and colleagues threw the kitchen sink at the eurozone\u2019s struggling economy. They slashed interest rates to zero, hit banks with deeper negative rates but also offered them free loans, boosted their bond-buying programme to \u20ac80bn/month, and started buying corporate debt. Today\u2019s meeting couldn\u2019t match that for drama, but we\u2019re going to hear more details of the plan. We\u2019re also expecting questions about opposition to the ECB\u2019s plan from some German politicians, and about the idea that central banks could be forced to monetise government debt or hand free money to citizens (helicopter money). With rates on hold, we now wait for Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, in around 40 minutes (1.30pm BST or 2.30pm in Frankfurt). The ECB says that Draghi will give more details about the stimulus measures he announced last month: Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we have started to expand our monthly purchases under the asset purchase programme to \u20ac80 billion. The focus is now on the implementation of the additional non-standard measures decided on 10 March 2016. Further information on the implementation aspects of the corporate sector purchase programme will be released after the press conference on the ECB\u2019s website. Here we go! The European Central bank has left interest rates unchanged. That means: the headline interest rate across the eurozone stays at zero, a record low. The deposit rate (for commercial bank deposits at the ECB) remains at minus -0.4%. That means banks will still be penalised for leaving money in Draghi\u2019s vaults. The marginal lending facility (which banks pay to borrow from the ECB) remains at +0.25%. And the ECB has also left its bond-buying programme unchanged, at \u20ac80bn per month. Two minutes to go until the European Central Bank decision! Just enough time to flag up this useful chart showing which ECB policymakers have been pushing for more monetary easing (the doves), and which are less convinced (hawks) Sweden\u2019s central bank has highlighted the weakness of Europe\u2019s economy, by boosting its stimulus package. But the move has also shown the limitations of monetary policy to move the markets. The Riksbank has announced it will boost its government bond-buying programme from 200bn Swedish krona to 245bn. That is designed to pump more money into the economy, and prevent the krona strengthening further against the euro. However, the markets didn\u2019t take the hint -- the krona actually strengthened immediately after the announcement. One for older readers:  Economist Sean Richards has written more about the Riksbank move, and the limits of central bankers, here: Will central banks forever cry \u201cTo Infinity! And Beyond!\u201d Europe\u2019s weak recovery, despite the ECB\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy, is one key reason why the region is being \u201cstretched to the limit\u201d, says the Economist Intelligence Unit in a new report. The EIU fears that Europe could be driven into heightened crisis this year, by problems such as migration, Britain\u2019s EU referendum, and Greece\u2019s debt woes. And the biggest risk facing Europe, according to the EIU, is that multiple challenges will come to a head simultaneously, overwhelming the region\u2019s policymakers. This could happen as soon as mid-2016, when the UK votes on whether or not to remain in the EU, Greece has large debt payments falling due and this year\u2019s migrant influx is likely to peak. Here are the seven separate problems that could scupper Europe\u2019s hopes of \u2018muddling through\u2019: Migration: The migration crisis touches on crucial issues of sovereignty, culture, borders and free movement. Europe\u2019s confused response so far has risked worsening the problem, although there are tentative signs that the recent EU-Turkey deal has slowed migrant flows. Brexit: The risks of the UK leaving the EU have increased over recent weeks\u2014chiefly because of a series of hits to the reputation for competence of the prime minister, David Cameron\u2014but we continue to expect the UK to vote \u201cremain\u201d in June. Grexit: We expect Greece to leave the euro zone during our five-year forecast period. Grexit would represent a huge political failure for the bloc, with potentially destabilising consequences: the principle of irreversibility would have been shattered. Monetary policy: A deepening reliance on accommodative monetary policy has been one of the hallmarks of the post-crisis period in Europe. This is creating its own challenges which the region is hard placed to address. Productivity: The region faces an ongoing crisis of productivity which it needs to address if it is to deliver improved growth. Regional security: Russia has become aggressively revisionist in the last several years, posing a challenge to the regional security architecture. Populism: Populist movements have come to prominence in rich and poor countries alike, and the region will struggle to manage the implications of an erosion of post-war political structures and voting patterns. Aengus Collins, Country Forecast Director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, warns that politicians are failing to tackle these crisis: \u201cPolicymakers appear increasingly unable to understand and respond to the desires of their electorates. This is leading to voting patterns that could have lasting destabilising effects. Nowhere are people more jittery about electoral risk right now than in the UK. We\u2019re sticking with our years-old forecast that in June the UK will vote to remain in the EU\u2014the pull of the status quo will strengthen as the vote draws closer and the risks of Brexit crystallise\u2014but all the momentum has been with the \u201cleave\u201d campaign in recent weeks and nothing can be taken for granted.\u201d And on monetary policy, the EIU warns: The idea that the ECB can boost the euro zone singlehandedly bumped up against the law of diminishing returns some time ago. In every speech he makes Mr Draghi exhorts the euro zone\u2019s political leaders to do more to promote growth in their economies. There is little evidence that they take these exhortations seriously.... The full report is online here: Europe stretched to the limit One hour to wait until the European Central Bank announces its decision on monetary policy, followed by a press conference at 1.30pm BST. City analyst Arjun Lakhanpal says Mario Draghi will try to reassure investors that his latest stimulus measures will work, and that further action is possible: John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, says chancellor Osborne must take the blame for missing the UK\u2019s borrowing targets in the last financial year: \u201cThe latest figures for public sector borrowing show George Osborne is on course to miss his only remaining target for the economy, with the Tory Government\u2019s deficit significantly higher than forecast. Government debt is rising even as unemployment increases and exports slump. \u201cThis is a record of further failure from the Chancellor of the Exchequer. His recovery is built on sand and his unaffordable and counterproductive fiscal targets mean that failures will continue. Labour\u2019s Fiscal Credibility Rule would set a realistic target to get rid of the deficit on day-to-day spending whilst allowing government the capacity to invest in the high-tech, high-wage economy of the future.\u201d The London stock markets has fallen into the red following the public finance figures, and the fall in UK retail sales. The FTSE 100 is down 50 points, or 0.8%, at 6360. Media group Sky is leading the fallers after reporting slowing customer growth numbers this morning. Conner Campbell of trading firm SpreadEx says: A double dose of dismal data was responsible for the index\u2019s slide, with retail sales plunging to -1.3% (nearing those post-Christmas lows) and the UK\u2019s borrowing figures overshooting George Osborne\u2019s targets by \u00a32 billion (to \u00a374 billion) for the 2015/16 financial year. This chart puts the retail sales fall in context: Britain\u2019s Debt Management Office has announced it will sell an extra \u00a32.1bn of government debt, to cover the shortfall in the public finances. George Osborne\u2019s second term as chancellor hasn\u2019t got off to a good start, says Ross Campbell, director for public sector policy at The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales: \u201cWithin the first year of new Parliament, Chancellor George Osborne has missed his deficit target by \u00a31.8bn. It was always apparent that there was very little margin for error and that any small change in assumptions for public expenditure plans would make it difficult to hit the Chancellor\u2019s \u00a372.2bn deficit target. Unless the UK economy, against the backdrop of a global economy that is unwilling to help the Chancellor dig himself out of out of his fiscal hole, improves somehow, it looks like the notion of returning to surplus by 2020 is highly improbable.\u201d Here\u2019s the official Treasury response to today\u2019s borrowing figures: Today\u2019s figures confirm that the record post-war deficit we inherited has been cut by almost two thirds as a share of GDP. \u201cWe are borrowing \u00a318 billion less than last year and March\u2019s monthly borrowing was the lowest for a decade. \u201cBut while the deficit is falling, the job of repairing the public finances is not done and the Budget set out action to ensure that debt falls in 2016-17 and Britain is back in the black by the end of this parliament.\u201d Economists are warning that Britain\u2019s public finances could be facing further problems. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics points out that today\u2019s borrowing figures don\u2019t show the impact of the recent economic slowdown. The risk of a much bigger overshoot this year has grown as the economy has slowed. With the fiscal projections also resting on optimistic assumptions for revenues from tax avoidance measures and savings from the welfare budget, we continue to think that the Chancellor will have to implement even more austerity than planned to achieve a budget surplus by 2020. Nina Skero of the Centre for Economics and Business Research agrees that George Osborne is unlikely to meet his goal of eliminating the deficit. With income tax thresholds set to rise over the remainder of this parliament, not only does the government face restrictions on cutting spending, but also on generating revenue. Therefore, it is very likely that within a couple of years the Chancellor will be faced with the unenviable task of deciding between cutting long-term investment spending or giving up on the self-imposed goal of eliminating the deficit by 2020. As cutting long-term investment spending eventually results in lower economic growth, Cebr believes that in this situation the Chancellor would be forced to abandon or postpone his deficit-eliminating ambitions. We expect a deficit of just over \u00a330 billion in 2020. Today\u2019s public finance figures could have been worse for the chancellor, argues Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global insight. George Osborne will be open to criticism as he missed the 2015/16 public finances targets that were set out as recently as March\u2019s budget \u2013 but he will probably be pretty relieved that a much improved March performance meant that the miss was narrow. Furthermore, he can argue that the public finance data will be revised many times over the coming months so there is a realistic chance that the final figure will show that he achieved his targets. George Osborne has been dealt \u201cyet another blow\u201d by the news that Britain borrowed almost \u00a32bn more than targeted last year, says Peter Spence of the Daily Telegraph. It\u2019s particularly awkward for the chancellor, as he read out the lower target to the House of Commons just last month. Peter explains: Revealing the OBR\u2019s forecast at the Budget in March, the Chancellor announced that the Government expected to borrow \u00a372.2bn in the fiscal year. However, it quickly became apparent that the UK would have to borrow more than planned. A week after the new targets were made public, ONS figures showed that the public sector had borrowed \u00a370.7bn in the first 11 months of the financial year, leaving Mr Osborne with just \u00a31.5bn to play with in March - a number he has failed to meet, barring a drastic revision of the figures at a later date. Britain borrowed more than expected in the last financial year, in another blow to George Osborne\u2019s attempts to eliminate the deficit. The UK borrowed almost \u00a374bn to balance the books in the 2015-16 financial year, according to new figures. That\u2019s almost \u00a32bn more than the official forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility in last month\u2019s budget. It\u2019s an embarrassment for George Osborne, and underlines how hard it will be to eliminate the deficit this parliament (as he is aiming to). The UK deficit is still coming down.; \u00a374bn is around \u00a317bn less than was borrowed in the previous 12 months. But the total national debt has now hit \u00a31,594.1 billion, equivalent to 83.5% of Gross Domestic Product. Discouraging news from the UK high street. British retail sales slumped by 1.3% in March, much worse than expectations of a 0.1% decline. On an annual basis, retail sales were 2.7% higher than in March 2015. But average store prices fell by 3.0% in March 2016 - the 21st consecutive month of year-on-year price falls. Most Asian markets have closed higher, although China dipped into the red: Today\u2019s ECB press conference is unlikely to be as dramatic at last year\u2019s \u2018Glitter Bombing\u2019, when protester Josephine Witt jumped on Draghi\u2019s desk before being carried out. Instead, Marc Ostwald of ADM Investors services expects plenty of questions about the effectiveness of the ECB\u2019s policies, the health of the banking sector, and the rift with Germany. Two weeks ago, German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble made an astonishing attack on Draghi \u2013 blaming the ECB for the rise of the eurosceptic Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party. As Sch\u00e4uble put it: \u201cI told Mario Draghi \u2026 you can be very proud [of AfD\u2019s rise].\u201d Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s remarks pushed the boundaries of central bank independence (if not hurdling them altogether). And it\u2019s notable that Germany\u2019s man at the ECB, Jens Weidmann, rebuked Draghi\u2019s critics last week. So Draghi is going to be quizzed about this issue today.... Mario Draghi could surprise the markets today by hinting at future interest rates cuts if growth and inflation don\u2019t pick up. So suggests Frederik Ducrozet, senior economist at Banque Pictet, the Swiss private bank. That would require a u-turn from Draghi, who suggested last month that rates were unlikely to go lower. That sent the euro soaring \u2013 which won\u2019t have pleased the ECB. Ducrozet, the only economist to predict last month\u2019s wide-ranging stimulus measures, also told Bloomberg TV that Draghi shouldn\u2019t be worried by criticism from Germany. It\u2019s good news that Germany is concerned, Ducrozet argues, as it shows that the ECB is setting monetary policy for the eurozone as a whole (rather than trying to placate its largest member). If Germany were happy, that would be bad as it would mean the ECB were setting a two-tiered policy. Ducrezet adds that Mario Draghi should aim to be calm and confident at today\u2019s press conference, and reassure investors that his plans are working. I\u2019m not saying he will have an easy ride, but he should stick with his own message\u2026. no stress, and be very proud Mr Draghi. To see the concerns within Germany over the ECB\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy, just check the Bild tabloid today. It asks: \u201cVerbrennt Draghi unser Geld?\u201d, or \u201cIs Draghi burning our money?\u201d, by cutting headline interest rates to zero and hitting banks with negative interest rates. Bild\u2019s complaint is that savers get virtually no return on their cash: Savers are paying the bill. Draghi (nicknamed Super Mario) is burning their hard-saved cash! However, the usual counterfactual applies \u2013 how much trouble would we be in if central banks had NOT eased monetary policy, or more banks had been allowed to fail? European stock markets have mostly opened higher this morning, although many investors are sitting tight until they hear from Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi will face questions today about the impact of negative interest, and the idea that central banks could be forced to drop money from the skies to get inflation up. So predicts Mark Haefele, global CIO at UBS Wealth Management. Writing on CNBC, he says: We expect no action from the European Central Bank (ECB) when it meets this Thursday. However, we do think investors should pay close attention to ECB President Draghi\u2019s words at the post-decision press conference. He is likely to respond to three key questions that many in the markets, including us, would like answered. First, are current policy measures like negative interest rates doing more harm than good? Second, are more out-of-the-box policy options like \u201chelicopter money\u201d in discussion? Third, what is the ECB\u2019s early take on longer-term growth and inflation? Helicopter money is the idea that central banks releases money directly to the private sector. Last month, Draghi described it as a \u201cvery interesting concept\u201d which the ECB \u201chaven\u2019t really studied yet\u201d -- hardly a rejection of the whole idea. Helicopter money would be unpopular with the ECB\u2019s existing critics, but might reassure investors who fear Dragh is running out of weapons, says Haefele. And on negative interest rates, Haefele adds: Markets want answers to the charge that sub-zero rates are doing more harm than good, squeezing bank profits rather than spurring them to lend. .... If markets are reassured that the ECB will only lower deposit rates further in the event of a deflationary shock, Eurozone banks shares may recoup some of their near 20 percent year-to-date losses and regain some of their confidence to lend. More here: Here\u2019s what to watch on ECB decision day Stock markets across Asia have risen as investors wait to hear from Mario Draghi today. Japan\u2019s Nikkei led the charge, closing up 457 points or 2.7%. Australia jumped by 1% and Hong Kong has gained 1.7%. This sent Asian markets to the highest levels in almost six months. Lingering hopes that oil producers might (eventually) agree some kind of production freeze also pushed up shares, traders said. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s ECB Day again. Over in Frankfurt, the governing council of the European Central Bank is gathering to set monetary policy across the eurozone. We\u2019re not expecting any new stimulus measures today. It\u2019s only six weeks since ECB chief Mario Draghi slashed interest rates and also boosted the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme. So Draghi could find himself fending off criticism from German politicians, including finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, for hurting savers with record low interest rates. There will be interest in what Draghi says about the battle against deflation, the latest deadlock between Greece and its creditors, and perhaps even domestic issues such as the rise of populist parties in Europe and Britain\u2019s EU referendum. Speaking of Britain, we get the latest UK retail sales and public finance figures this morning. After yesterday\u2019s rise in unemployment, economists will be looking for further signs that growth is slowing down. We\u2019ll also have an eye on Greece\u2019s bailout talks, and the scandal around Japanese carmaker Mitsubishi which admitted faking fuel efficiency tests. Volkswagen was not alone....

As part of <strong><a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/business/gertjan-vlieghe-the-bank-of-england-ratesetter-who-didn-t-even-want-to-be-an-economist-a3231651.html\">a profile of the Bank\u2019s newest rate-setter</a></strong>, the subject of interest rates comes up:</p> <blockquote> <p>But could the Bank of England follow the example of others by cutting interest rates into negative territory if necessary? Vlieghe\u2019s answer is intriguing: \u201cTheoretically, I think interest rates could go a little bit negative.\u201d He says that the Bank would \u201chave to think very carefully\u201d about whether the positive effects would outweigh the downside \u2014 as in Switzerland, for example, where mortgage rates went up. </p> <p>He adds, however: \u201cEven if you are willing theoretically to consider negative interest rates, there is only so far that they can go negative before you start worrying about the thing that central bankers have been worrying about all these years \u2014 which is \u2018not only am I not getting any interest paid on my money in the bank, it is now potentially going to charge me, in which case I won\u2019t keep my money in the bank, I\u2019ll just take it out and keep it at home\u2019. Once that happens, that is almost certainly negative for the economy because then you undermine the whole bank funding model... so we want to stay well away from that scenario.\u201d</p> <p>How deep into negative territory could rates go? That depends on the costs to large companies of storing, transporting and insuring huge piles of cash themselves, he argues. \u201cPeople have tried to come up with how much it costs to do that. I\u2019ve seen estimates in the range of anything from 0.75% and up. Once you start thinking about rates 0.75% negative, companies are going to start taking that seriously. I think the switching point is somewhere around minus 0.5%, minus 0.75%, maybe minus 1%.

                "bodyText":"Meanwhile the US rig count fell for the fifth week in a row to lows last seen in November 2009, according to Baker Hughes which compliles the data. On that note, it\u2019s time to close the blog for the day and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. And here is some video of the opening remarks from Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem at the Ecofin press conference. And with that the press conference is over. Meanwhile Dijsselbloem has tweeted more on the Panama Papers: Quesionts, and one on the Greek situation and the need to legislate any contingency measures, which the Greeks had said is not possible. Dijsselbloem said the institutions will work with the Greek authorities to design the contingency measures. They need to be credible. [There was mention of a fourth bailout]. Dijsselbloem said this is not about a fourth bailout. This is about if the [proposed] measures do not deliver. \u201cWhen I look at the latest figures, the Greeks are on track, it is an extra security package. If there are legal constraints, we will design it in a way that delivers... and needs to be legally possible of course.\u201d Klaas Knot of De Nederlandsche Bank talked of low carbon economy. Discussed how to help consumers in their decisions by increasing transparency. Essential that adequate price incentives are available. Better disclosure of climate exposure is needed. Stress testing should be introduced [in a co-ordinated way]. This could be taken up, for example, by the European systemic risk board. Working to get agreement on anti-tax avoidance, hope for agreement in May, says Dijsselbloem. Also list of non-co-operative jurisdictions. On money laundering, focus was on terrorist funding, now want more on beneficial ownership and others. Ministers was speedy implementation of transparency, including Panama. Panama Papers gave another boost to our agenda to tackle tax evasion and money laundering. Clear view that Europe should lead. Secondly they discussed strengthening the banking union, with differing views on how to achieve it. Finally, Panama Papers. Hadn\u2019t initially intended to discuss it. They were also discussed in G20 and last week the G5 took initiative on information on ultimate ownership. (As George Osborne said earlier ) 28 others joined it, which is a great outcome says Dijsselbloem. Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem said duing lunch, finance ministers discussed the EU budget, and how the financail framework could better respond to unforeseen events. He mentions in particular the response to challenges like the migration crisis. The Econfin briefing has just begun and can be seen here. A combination of factors has helped push markets lower as the trading week ends, with mixed data from Europe and the US, mining shares lower as metals come under pressure again and the continuing repercussions of the car emissions scandal. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 71 points or 1.11% to 6310 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.6% to 10,373.49 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.29% lower at 4569.66 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.25% to 18,687.04 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.39% at 9232.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.2% to 605.92 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 27 points or 0.15%. Meanwhile Brent crude is up 2.36% at $45.58 a barrel. The damage done to Volkswagen from the emissions scandal has been revealed in its full year results. Julia Kollewe writes: Volkswagen has slumped to its first annual loss in more than 20 years after making a \u20ac16.2bn (\u00a312.6bn) provision for costs relating to the diesel emissions scandal. This pushed VW into an operating loss of \u20ac4.1bn for 2015, bigger than analysts had expected and the company\u2019s first annual loss since 1993, after a \u20ac12.7bn profit in 2014. The company more than doubled its provision for fixing diesel cars to \u20ac16.2bn, a day after announcing plans for the biggest car buyback in history in the US, potentially almost 500,000 vehicles, as part of a deal with the State Department to halt more than 600 class action civil suits. VW said the provision related to the emissions scandal, \u201camong other things for pending technical modifications and customer-related measures as well as global legal risks\u201d. The German carmaker stunned the world when it admitted last September that it had installed software in diesel vehicles to cheat emissions tests \u2013 potentially affecting a total of 11m cars worldwide. Chief executive Matthias M\u00fcller said: \u201cThe current crisis \u2013 as the figures presented today also reveal \u2013 is having a huge impact on Volkswagen\u2019s financial position. Yet we have the firm intention and the means to handle the difficult situation we are in using our own resources.\u201d The full story is here: Here\u2019s our full story on the new \u00a320 banknote: The artist chosen to appear on the next \u00a320 banknote has been revealed by Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Carney unveiled the winner, chosen after the public nominated a number of artists to appear, at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate. Appropriately, it was J M W Turner who will appear on the note, which will enter circulation by 2020. UK chancellor George Osborne has been tweeting about new measures agreed to improve tax transparency: Meanwhile on the currency markets the pound has moved sharply higher after a number of polls gave a lead to the Remain campaign in the EU referendum. Sterling rose by more than half a per cent to $1.4425 and added 0.7% to hit a four week high against the euro. The pound rose 2.3% to a three week high against the yen, helped by the Japanese currency coming under pressure following reports the Bank of Japan was considering expanding its negative interest rate policy to bank loans, and could even cut rates further. Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe has told the Evening Standard that UK rates could theoretically go negative. As part of a profile of the Bank\u2019s newest rate-setter, the subject of interest rates comes up: But could the Bank of England follow the example of others by cutting interest rates into negative territory if necessary? Vlieghe\u2019s answer is intriguing: \u201cTheoretically, I think interest rates could go a little bit negative.\u201d He says that the Bank would \u201chave to think very carefully\u201d about whether the positive effects would outweigh the downside \u2014 as in Switzerland, for example, where mortgage rates went up. He adds, however: \u201cEven if you are willing theoretically to consider negative interest rates, there is only so far that they can go negative before you start worrying about the thing that central bankers have been worrying about all these years \u2014 which is \u2018not only am I not getting any interest paid on my money in the bank, it is now potentially going to charge me, in which case I won\u2019t keep my money in the bank, I\u2019ll just take it out and keep it at home\u2019. Once that happens, that is almost certainly negative for the economy because then you undermine the whole bank funding model... so we want to stay well away from that scenario.\u201d How deep into negative territory could rates go? That depends on the costs to large companies of storing, transporting and insuring huge piles of cash themselves, he argues. \u201cPeople have tried to come up with how much it costs to do that. I\u2019ve seen estimates in the range of anything from 0.75% and up. Once you start thinking about rates 0.75% negative, companies are going to start taking that seriously. I think the switching point is somewhere around minus 0.5%, minus 0.75%, maybe minus 1%. But I\u2019m also saying I don\u2019t even want to get close to it because I don\u2019t know exactly where it is.\u201d Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: A below expectations performance by US manufacturing will be cause for concern, particularly among those who had predicted the sector was heading towards growth. Optimists pointed to last month\u2019s uptick in new orders as a sign of resurgence. However, pressure from a strong dollar and an uncertain business outlook ahead of a turbulent presidential race appear to be taking their toll. The challenge for Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Fed will be to build some momentum for a sector which has stubbornly avoided significant growth in recent months. Over to the US, and some weak manufacturing data for April. The Markit initial reading of the months\u2019s manufacturing PMI fell to its lowest for just over six and a half years, down from 51.5 in March to 50.8 and lower than the 52 level analysts had expected. Markit said production volumes were close to stagnation amid a slowdown in new business growth, and there was the weakest rise in manufacturing employment since June 2013. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: US factories reported their worst month for just over six-and-a-half years in April, dashing hopes that first quarter weakness will prove temporary. Survey measures of output and order book backlogs are down to their lowest since the height of the global financial crisis, prompting employers to cut back on their hiring. The survey data are broadly consistent with manufacturing output falling at an annualised rate of over 2% at the start of the second quarter, and factory employment dropping at a rate of 10,000 jobs per month. With prior months\u2019 survey data pointing to annualized GDP growth of just 0.7% in the first quarter, the deteriorating performance of manufacturing suggests that growth could weaken closer towards stagnation in the second quarter. The survey responses reveal an increase in business uncertainty in relation to both the economic and political outlook during the month, which is weighing on spending and investment decisions and exacerbating already-weak demand both at home and abroad. US investors are in cautious mood in early trading. Dow Jones: -0.07% at 17,969.61 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,086.71 Nasdaq: -0.9% at 4,899.89 Welsh billionaire Sir Terry Matthews said he might be willing to put some of his own money into a management buyout of Tata\u2019s UK business and the Port Talbot steelworks. The Guardian\u2019s Graham Ruddick reports: Matthews said he is \u201cfeeling really good\u201d about the prospects of a rescue deal for the steel business, which could save thousands of jobs in the UK. Matthews, who made his fortune in technology and telecoms, is part of a consortium of public and private sector figures from south Wales supporting a management buyout. The tycoon said the consortium is still putting its team together and its funding has yet to be finalised, but that he is ready to back the buyout. \u201cIf it makes sensible business and the future looks really good, frankly there will be investors and we already know it,\u201d he told BBC Wales. \u201cPotentially me too. The fact is, you first put a really good team together, then you fight in an area which has upside. So I am feeling pretty good about it.\u201d Here is a summary of the main messages coming out of the Eurogroup meeting on Greece. Progress has been made on reaching an agreed package of Greek reforms and a Greek debt deal. Greece and its lenders are \u201cvery close\u201d to reaching a deal on an \u201cupfront\u201d package of measures, worth 3% of GDP. Eurogroup also wants Greece to come up with a package of contingency measures, equivalent to 2% of GDP, as an insurance policy if Greece needs to do more to reach its targets. The IMF would like the contingency plans to be legislated for, to give them credibility. However, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos told journalists it would not be possible to legislate for contingency measures, because Greek law would not allow it. He said Greece and its lenders would instead have to find \u201ca commitment mechanism\u201d. Greece and its lenders are going to work on a deal over the next few days. If sufficient progress has been made, Eurogroup ministers will meet again on Thursday next week. The IMF is ready to dispatch its team back to Athens, to work with Greek officials. Now that the Eurogroup meeting is over, finance ministers have disappeared into the Econfin meeting (which includes all EU ministers, not just those from the eurozone). The Panama Papers and EU budget are among the items on the agenda. Assurances from the Eurogroup that a deal on Greek reform measures and debt is close has done nothing to cheer investors. Most European markets are still down. HSBC escapes a major revolt over executive pay: The Greek finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, has thrown a bit of a spanner in the works over these contingency measures. In a separate press conference, he told journalists that within Greek law, there is no possibility of legislating for something that might or might not happen in the future. Dijsselbloem however seemed adamant the contingency measures would have to be legislated... Tsakalotos said that while Greece won\u2019t be able to legislate on contingencies, it will engage with the Europeans to find \u201ca commitment mechanism\u201d on measures so that credibility and trust is achieved. He seemed broadly upbeat after the meeting: We essentially agreed on the package that was discussed last summer. There are a few technical details left to discuss over the next two days but there wasn\u2019t anybody in that room who challenged the idea that that package hasn\u2019t been done. Any solution will have to meet two criteria. The first is that within Greek law, you cannot legislate contingently. You cannot say you will do \u201cx\u201d if the state of the world, \u201cy\u201d, is in place in 2018 or 2019. And the second criterium is whatever solution we find over the next few days must be credible to the creditors, to investors...and to the Greek people. Whatever solution we arrive at will be done so together with the debt. It is absolutely crucial for us that the whole package on debt and reform gives a clear signal to Greek citizens and to European citizens, and to Greek and international investors, that Greece has turned a corner, that there is a clear runway of exiting the crisis. Greek bond yields have fallen following the Eurogroup meeting, on hopes that Greece is close to agreeing a deal with its lenders. Two year yields fell 52 basis points to 10.46%, while benchmark 10-year yields nudged down by 14 basis points to 8.72%. Christine Lagarde admits that Eurostat\u2019s data (on Greece\u2019s public finances) was more positive than the IMF expected (and other forecasters, she points out), and that might mean the IMF will have to rethink its calculations. However, she suggests that Eurostat might have got the numbers wrong...as they have done before... Dijsselbloem on how the contingency measures to be put forward by Greece might be legislated: In order for the contingency measures to be credible, they need to be legislated. Now how that is designed, whether you just legislate a mechanism, or individual measures is yet to be discussed. Has the Eurogroup given itself too much to do before next Thursday ( when ministers hope to reconvene to discuss progress on Greece), Dijsselbloem is asked. We will all have to bridge our differences. For some of course, the contingency measures are difficult, and for some debt is a big issue, politically difficult. But on all sides it was very constructive today and there was an open attitude to cross that bridge. Dijsselbloem takes a question on the size of the Greek package and contingency measures. He says the upfront package is worth 3% and is almost complete, while the contingency measures will be worth 2% of GDP, to supplement the main package (\u201conly if necessary\u201d). The latest figures from Greece have been quite good so there is reason for some optimism. But to give that extra assurance and confidence, both in the Eurogroup but also outside investors and markets, we are looking for that additional two percentage points. Christine Lagarde is speaking. The head of the International Monetary Fund says progress on Greece is being made. She says measures must be \u201clegislated up front, and credible\u201d. We are confident we can work together well and I have asked my team to be ready to return to Athens right away to continue the work. It has to work on two legs: the measures on the one leg, and debt sustainability on the other. Back at the Eurogroup in Amsterdam, finance ministers support the idea that Greece needs to come up with contingency measures as an insurance policy against \u201cdownside risks\u201d. So that if there is any financial shock and Greece needs to do more, it will be able to do so rapidly. My colleague Jill Treanor is tweeting from the HSBC annual meeting here. Dijsselbloem says that Greece will go away and work both on a possible upfront package of measures, and a package of contingent measures. The Eurogroup will then meet again on Thursday next week (he stresses this is not 100% confirmed yet), to discuss the proposed measures. We will also have a \u201cserious conversation\u201d about a debt relief package for Greece. He confirms there is \u201cno support [among eurozone finance ministers] for nominal haircuts on the debt\u201d. Here we go, Dijsselbloem is taking his place. He jokes about how many press conferences there will be today and tomorrow...three. The eurozone has weathered global events quite well. Having said that, let\u2019s turn to Greece. Co-operation between the institutions and Greek authorities has been strong and productive. We believe substantial progress has been made and we are close to agreement. Today we looked at the way to go forward... The policy package should include a contingent package that should be implemented if necessary to meet the budget surplus targets. The design of that needs further work, what the measures would be and what would trigger it. Journalists await Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is due to give a press conference any minute now. HSBC bosses are in for some stick at today\u2019s AGM... Journalists are reporting long queues to get through security: HSBC is the latest major corporate to face shareholder contempt at its annual meeting on Friday. As the Guardian\u2019s Jill Treanor reports, the Panama Papers, executive pay, and boardroom composition are all expected to be high on the agenda. Oil prices are on course to finish up for the third week in a row. Brent crude oil is currently trading at $44.39 a barrel (down 0.3% on the day). Crude is up more than two-thirds since its early 2016 lows, and traders said sentiment was improving despite a persistent oversupply. Goldman Sachs said in a note: While this recent rally has the potential to run further to the upside ... we believe that is not yet driven by a sustainable shift in fundamentals. Mining giant Anglo American has responded to the shareholder revolt staged at Thursday\u2019s annual meeting. More than 40% of investors voted against the \u00a33.4m pay of the chief executive, Mark Cutifani, in the latest shareholder protest against boardroom excess. The vote was non-binding. In a statement on Friday, Anglo said it was \u201cmindful\u201d of shareholder concerns about executive pay. The mining company said it would consult with shareholders over the coming months before its next annual meeting in 2017, when a revised pay policy will be put to the vote. The company said: Setting executive remuneration in a volatile industry such as mining can be challenging and the remuneration committee intends to again engage with shareholders in order to refine the policy to ensure that it is both appropriate and motivational. Anglo shares are down this morning - along with other miners - falling 2% to 732p. Dijsselbloem is expected to give a press conference following the Eurogroup meeting at 11.15 UK time (12.15 in Amsterdam). We will be reporting his comments, and you should be able to watch the presser live here. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has been spotted chatting to Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, at the Eurogroup meeting in Amsterdam. The two men have been involved in a verbal bust up over the amount of stimulus the ECB is pumping into the eurozone economy, as it attempts to kick-start a meaningful recovery and stave off deflation. Sch\u00e4uble thinks it has gone too far, with record low rates causing problems for German banks and pensioners. Here they are today putting their differences to one side... maybe. Dijsselbloem is presumably on hand in case tensions rise... Judging by your reader comments below the line, you are not convinced there will be much progress made on Greece in Amsterdam today... Back to Amsterdam... You can hear what Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem had to say as he arrived for the meeting here. Among other things, he spoke up for Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, who yesterday fiercely defended the independence of the central bank in the face of German criticism over its stimulus programme. Draghi\u2019s main point was: We obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent. This is what Dijsselbloem said: Mr Draghi has to do his work [independently]. That also means we politicians really restrain ourselves. He has to take decisions that are good for the eurozone as a whole within his mandate, and that is exactly what the ECB is doing. The more we refrain from comments, the more effective he can be. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit and author of the flash Germany PMI report, described growth in the private sector in Europe\u2019s largest economy as \u201cunspectacular\u201d and \u201cuninspiring\u201d. Markit\u2019s surveys for the German manufacturing and services sectors suggest growth in the private sector was the slowest in nine months in April. It was dragged down by the services sector, with the headline PMI falling unexpectedly to 54.6 in April from 55.1 in March. Manufacturing was better, rising to 51.9 from 50.7. Steve Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple, has told the BBC the US tech giant should pay more tax. He said all firms, including Apple, should pay the same 50% tax rate he does. Wozniak, who founded Apple with Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne in 1976, told BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Wake Up to Money: I don\u2019t like the idea that Apple might be unfair \u2013 not paying taxes the way I do as a person. I do a lot of work, I do a lot of travel and I pay over 50% of anything I make in taxes and I believe that\u2019s part of life and you should do it. European investors are lacking cheer this morning, with all major indices in the red: Combined, the manufacturing and services PMIs suggest the French private sector just about scraped growth in April. The composite PMI rose to 50.5 from 50 in March, hitting a five-month high. Jack Kennedy, who compiles the French surveys at Markit, said: The French private sector economy eked out marginal growth at the start of the second quarter after broadly stagnating on average during the opening three months of the year. Expansion was centred on the dominant service sector, as manufacturing was weighed down by a sharp drop in incoming new orders. The PMI data continue to paint a picture of a private sector economy stuck in a weak growth trajectory accompanied by little meaningful job creation. The PMI data for the French manufacturing and services sector is a bit of a mixed bag this morning. French manufacturing activity fell in April at an accelerated rate. The headline PMI index (measuring output, new business, confidence and employment), dropped to an 8-month low of 48.3, from 49.6 in March. Anything below 50 indicates contraction. It was worse than expected, with economists polled by Reuters predicting the headline manufacturing index would pick up slightly to 49.8. The services sector fared better in April, with activity rising to a five-month high. The headline services PMI rose to 50.8 - back in expansion territory - from 49.9 in March. Despite his cheer, Dijsselbloem is already managing expectations about what the Eurogroup will actually achieve today. Greece is trying to hammer out an agreement with its international lenders to unlock further loans, but Dijsselbloem said it was still early days in the process. Speaking in Amsterdam, he said: I\u2019m hearing good news from Athens, so let\u2019s see where we are. If we make progress on the content of the programme and the next steps then we need to start the discussion on debt. We\u2019re only at the beginning of that discussion, so don\u2019t expect any deals today. Debt is a discussion we\u2019ve not had before. The only thing we had was a promise that if the Greeks would commit fully and deliver on the programme we would look at, if necessary, further debt measures. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Eurogroup and Ecofin president (and Dutch finance minister), is welcoming his colleagues to the wonderful city of Amsterdam. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The main event today is the the Eurogroup meeting in Amsterdam, where finance ministers will discuss the latest developments in the Greek debt crisis and try and hammer out a way forward. The meeting will take place 9am-12pm (local time, 8am-11am UK time) at the Maritime Museum in Amsterdam. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Eurogroup (and Ecofin) president will give a press conference when the meeting concludes. It will be followed by an Ecofin meeting - where ministers from the nine EU countries that are not part of the eurozone will join their colleagues. On the agenda there is a working lunch on EU budget problems; a session on the Panama Papers; and a session on strengthening the banking union. We will bring you all the latest developments from Amsterdam throughout the day. Elsewhere we have the flash manufacturing and services PMIs for Germany and France for April, which will offer the latest indication of how Europe\u2019s two largest economies are doing.",

Last month BHS\u2019s landlords agreed to slash its rent bill but extra funding is required to pay staff and continue trading in its 164 stores.</p> <p>Austin Reed has been struggling for some time and last year shut 31 stores, leaving it with 155 shops and concessions. It has filed a notice of intent to appoint administrators, giving the retailer, which also owns Viyella and CC (previously Country Casuals), protection from creditors for 10 days before potentially tipping into administration.</p> <p>Denison said the depressed footfall numbers for Newcastle \u2013 which excludes the 340-store Metrocentre mall in nearby Gateshead \u2013 could be a result of the growing blight of empty high street shops in the north-east. According to consultancy the Local Data Company (LDC) the shop vacancy rate in Newcastle is 17.8%, compared with a national figure of 12.5%.</p> <p>\u201cThe north of England generally saw a drop in footfall of 1.2% in the first quarter, which was worse than the national average,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it is both a local and a regional issue.\u201d The plight of Newcastle United football club, which is firmly in the Premier League relegation zone, could also be a factor, suggests Denison. The Toon army finds itself with little to cheer \u2013 or shop \u2013 about.</p> <p>\u201cNewcastle also has a reputation for being a vibrant city, full of pubs and clubs,\u201d he adds. \u201cPeople may be more inclined to spend any discretionary income on an evening out rather than in the shops.\u201d</p> <p>Some 46,000 UK shops lie empty and around a third of those have been empty for more than three years, says LDC director Matthew Hopkinson. After a torrid time during the recession, the national vacancy rate in March was at its the lowest since January 2010, at 12.5% \u2013 but that figure masks a serious mismatch between supply and demand.</p> <p>\u201cWhile stability has returned overall for the chain retailers in our high streets, the fact remains that they have continued to close more shops than they open and have done so since 2011,\u201d says Hopkinson. \u201cOut-of-town locations are a destination of choice for many of them, with free parking, easy access and more space to service and deliver the experiences that the modern consumer demands.\u201d</p> <p>Today retailers \u2013 and shoppers \u2013 want large, modern stores in the best locations, and these are boxes that older high streets are unable to tick. In Stoke-on-Trent for example, says Hopkinson, there are simply \u201ctoo many shops for the amount of people and the disposable income they\u2019ve got\u201d.</p> <p>Separate data, produced by industry trade body the British Retail Consortium (BRC), also recorded a marked drop in footfall in March. Visits to high streets and malls were down nearly 4% compared with a year ago \u2013 although, in a sign of changing shopping tastes, visits to retail parks were up 1.6%.</p> <p>BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson says the changes are the result of structural upheaval within the retail industry as shopping habits adapt in response to the internet.</p> <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistic showed online sales surging nearly 9% in March compared with a year ago, and online stores now accounting for 13.2% of all retail sales.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3038b1f0fbc71c2ca92c7af3514bcd1232594a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3038b1f0fbc71c2ca92c7af3514bcd1232594a6/0_257_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A busy day in Cambridge, but even the prosperous university town has seen a fall in shopper numbers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A busy day in Cambridge, but even the prosperous university town has seen a fall in shopper numbers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe know that declining footfall makes it harder to keep shops open and profitable,\u201d says Dickinson. \u201cAreas that are already economically fragile are likely to see the greatest impact of future store closures.\u201d</p> <p>Consumer spending has been the driving force behind Britain\u2019s economic recovery, making up for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/08/weak-industry-data-set-to-weigh-on-uk-economy-steel-production\" title=\"\">sluggish manufacturing sector</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/15/uk-housebuilding-booms-but-construction-sector-flags\" title=\"\">recession-scarred construction industry</a>.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u2019s our editorial on the collapse of BHS, and the long run of mistakes and poor business practices that led to today\u2019s administration: The Guardian view on BHS: murder on the high street It concludes: As the government-run Pension Protection Fund prepares to rescue the BHS pensioners, the familiar mismatch between private profits and public losses is in evidence once again. eanwhile, hollowed-out husks could soon blight 100-plus high streets, yet another story of common space being disfigured after private greed enjoyed free reign. And a community used to being fleeced could be left with another nasty outbreak of British heist sores. And on that note, we\u2019re wrapping up until tomorrow... Goodnight, and thanks for the comments. GW The BHS crisis makes the front page of Tuesday\u2019s Guardian, and the news that its newish owners have taken \u00a325m out of the firm. Sarah Butler has looked into how the Green family have benefited from BHS over the years, and writes: When Sir Philip Green bought BHS in May 2000, he insisted it would not be rocket science to revive the ailing high street retailer. After paying \u00a3200m, he was convinced he had the skills to secure its future and make it the foundation of a sprawling retail empire. But last year, after failing in his mission, Green sold BHS for \u00a31 to a little known group of investors who have steered it into collapse in just over 12 months. His dreams for the chain may have come to nothing, but Green\u2019s family have still been big winners from BHS, taking out more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans to help fund a lavish lifestyle.... More here: Writing in the Guardian tonight, retail expert Mary Portas argues that BHS could have been saved from collapse with a bit more imagination. Here\u2019s a flavour: If I had been at British Home Stores I would have looked at today\u2019s market place and created a brand that is relevant for today\u2019s shopper. I would have gone totally after the value market, but made it functional and cool. I would have started with where it was good \u2013 the lighting. Then I would have extended that to become a modern British lifestyle retailer at a great price. Look at Tiger, which has come on to our high streets. It has done an extraordinary job of taking that basic fundamental market, that was the old Woolies, and made it sexy. Imagine if British Home Stores\u2019 ground floor was like Tiger, its fashion floor like Uniqlo or Primark and its home stuff like Ikea. Value with sex appeal all under one roof. Then add some small startups that are all young British makers or designers.... It\u2019s a balmy 16 degrees in Monaco tonight. But if Sir Philip Green is there, he may just have felt the chill of criticism from the House of Commons. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle put the former BHS owner firmly in the spotlight this afternoon, saying he faces \u201cserious questions\u201d. She basically accused Green of taking far more out of BHS (\u00a3422m) than he paid for it (\u00a3200m), before \u2018walking away\u2019 to his favourite tax haven. That will sting Green, who is sensitive to criticism over his ownership of BHS. But the toughest criticism actually came from Conservative MP Richard Fuller. He gave Green both barrels, saying he actually received \u201830 pieces of silver\u2019 for BHS, if he knowingly abandoned workers and pensioners to their fate. Fuller also channelled former PM Edward Heath, using the killer phrase \u2018the unacceptable face of capitalism\u2019 to describe those who renege on their pension liabilities. A rare experience, to be compared to both Tiny Rowland and Judas. MPs also remember the experience with Comet, where the taxpayer found itself on the hook for thousands of redundancy payments. They won\u2019t accept the Pension Protection Fund being stung this time, if it can be avoided. And if Anna Soubry had a secret rescue plan for BHS, she\u2019s keeping it to herself. The government view is that the retailer is a victim of changing shopping patterns and structural change - which is why finding a buyer has been so tough. Soubry kept repeating that BHS stores are open, but if a buyer isn\u2019t found soon, that won\u2019t last..... The final question goes to Martin Docherty-Hughes, SNP MP. The real scandal is that BHS workers face redundancies, and losing 10% of their pensions. Can the minister promise that all inquiries into BHS will be open and transparent, and that the \u2018full force of the law\u2019 will be used, if needed? Yes, Soubry replies. And that\u2019s the end of the session. Labour MP Diana Johnson warns parliament that BHS could be a repeat of the collapse of Comet. When Comet went into administration in 2012, there were 7,000 redundancies and the taxpayer paid up to \u00a3100m in redundancy costs. Comet had been owned by a private equity firm which bought the firm for a pound, loaded it with debt, and then walked away. The government should publish its report into Comet, so we can see if lessons can be learned. Anna Soubry promises to find out what happened to that report. Cardiff MP Jo Stephens asks whether the Insolvency Service has the resources to help BHS workers, given its budget is being cut. Soubry says she has full confidence in the insolvency service. Labour MP Gavin Shuker says the UK retail sector is dominated by low pay and lack of opportunity, and also dominated by women workers. Will the government do more to help regenerate the sector? Soubry says employers she has met are committed to helping their staff develop, but agrees that anything that helps female workers must be welcomed. SNP MP Roger Mullin says BHS workers are paying the price for Philip Green\u2019s failure, while he awaits for his new yacht. Why shouldn\u2019t Green be forced to pay the full \u00a3591m pension blackhole? Soubry says that it\u2019s important to do the right thing for workers who have paid into a pension their whole working life. Our market economy is dangerously undermined when the privatisation of vast profits isswiftly followed by the projections of similarly large losses onto other people, whether taxpayers or pensioners, says Conservative MP Steve Baker. Could the government look at the treatment of excessive debt, to avoid a repeat? Soubry says there are always lessons to be learned, but reiterates that BHS is still open and looking for a buyer. Q: Will Anna Soubry meet with the USDAW union to discuss how to save BHS jobs? I\u2019ll meet with pretty much anyone, Soubry replies. She\u2019s happy to meet USDAW, and try to persuade them to change their view on Sunday trading. Q: Does Soubry know whether the BHS trustees signed off the BHS \u00a31 last year. Were the Pension Protection Fund involved? And if not, could we close this loophole? Soubry says she doesn\u2019t know, but will write and find out.... Grimsby MP Melanie Onn says her constituency has lost Woolworths, Comet, Staples, Phones4U and now a WHSmiths store. She asks Soubry if she is concerned that BHS generated \u00a3100m through \u2018negative goodwill\u2019, which was then paid out in dividends rather than reinvested. Soubry replies that she actually recently shopped in Grimsby (eliciting an inaudible, but seemingly amusing, reply from Onn). Soubry replies that capitalism must have a caring heart. She agrees that Fuller is raising very serious issues, and we must see what conclusions the regulators come to. If there are any suggestions of impropriety, we will come after people, she adds. Richard Fuller, Conservative MP, says that the former owner of BHS [Philip Green] may have gone \u201claughing all the way to the bank\u201d when Retail Acquisitions offered to buy the group for \u00a31. But.... If that sale was done on the understanding that he was avoiding a responsibility for those pension losses, then \u00a31 was equivalent to 30 pieces of silver for that betrayal of the employees and pensioners. There is a reputational question here for Philip Green to answer, Fuller continues. The minister must write to him, and ask him to address these issues. And the government must assess the Pension Protection Fund, to avoid \u201cthis unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d of passing losses onto the taxpayer. SNP MP Alison Thewliss asks what the government is doing for workers at other companies why rely on BHS. Soubry says that we know that other companies in a supply chain suffer when one business fails. That\u2019s why we must stay positive and hope a buyer can be found. Conservative MP Peter Bottomley say he visited a BHS branch today and told workers that they have the full support of the House of Commons. Workers jobs and pensions must be a top priority, he adds. BHS has suffered from online sales, Soubry replies, and also from the fact people are less loyal to individual retailers these days. If you\u2019ve got BHS vouchers, go and spend them and support the staff, and the high street, she declares. Labour MP Ian Wright says it cannot be right for Philip Green to load BHS up with debt, fail to invest, pay his wife \u00a3400m in dividends, and live in a tax haven. Something is gravely wrong, he says. New legislation is needed to prevent owners making a fast buck. Soubry says that any allegations of impropriety must be taken very seriously. The SNP\u2019s Hannah Bardell says her party stand in solidarity with BHS workers at this time. She says there are some very serious allegations in the newpapers today, including the FT\u2019s article about the \u00a31bn \u2018siphoned out of BHS\u2019 The gap in BHS\u2019s pension fund merits serious investigation, she adds. Anna Soubry repeats that BHS stores are still open, and it\u2019s important not to talk the company into a deeper crisis. Conservative MP Mark Field says he is concerned that the Pension Protection Fund is being used as a bargaining chip, rather than in exceptional cases when a firm fails. Field says he shares the opposition\u2019s concern over the behaviour of the current and former BHS owners. Soubry agrees that the PPF should not be abused. Anna Soubry\u2019s statement on BHS is online here. Responding to Eagle, Soubry says her concern is for the workers at BHS, and its creditors. Eagle is turning this into a party political game, she claims. The Pensions Regulator is investigating the BHS pension blackhols now. And the insolvency service will take allegations of malpractice very seriously. Soubry also claims that the opposition would have more credibility if they hadn\u2019t voted against Sunday trading changes - which might have helped BHS. Philip Green has taken hundreds of millions out of BHS, and then walked away to his favourite tax haven leaving the pensions protection scheme to pick up the bill, Eagle continues. She cites the Guardian\u2019s revelation that BHS\u2019s new owner, Retail Acquisitions, has received more than \u00a325m in the last 13 months. She asks Anna Soubry to comment on Green\u2019s conduct as BHS\u2019s owner, and whether she agrees that owners should be forced to make a fair contribution Green has reportedly offered \u00a340m to the pensions black hole - is that acceptable? And will the government review the law to prevent irresponsible owners walking away and leaving others with the liabilities? Labour shadow minister Angela Eagle responds to Anna Soubry. 11,000 BHS staff will be very worried today. All MPs must hope that BHS can be sold as a going concern. But if the worst happens, the government must offer support to workers. Philip Green has some serious questions to answer, Eagle continues, having bought it for \u00a3200m, taken \u00a3422m of dividends, then sold it for \u00a31. He seems to have taken out far more from the business than he paid for it, she says. The pension fund had a \u00a3500 surplus when Green bought it, but this had become a deficit of hundreds of millions when he sold it, Eagle adds. Anna Soubry adds that there has been \u201csome speculation about the BHS pension scheme\u201d. She can\u2019t comment directly, but understands that the Pension Protection Fund is assessing the final funding position of the scheme, and who is responsible for its shortfall. Over in parliament, small business minister Anna Soubry is making a statement about BHS\u2019s collapse now. Soubry says that it is very difficult time for all the employees - up to 11,000 across the UK. It\u2019s also a difficult time for the company\u2019s creditors. The BHS name has been synonymous with British high streets for over 80 years, she continues, and still has a high street presence. She continues that the \u201cclear message\u201d is that BHS is still open for business. I understand that there are no plans for immediate redundancies or store closures, and that the administrators are looking to sell BHS as a going concern. If you\u2019ve been following the blog today, you\u2019ll already know that Damien has been interviewing shoppers about the decline and fall of BHS. Here\u2019s his full piece from Oxford Street: While we wait for the government\u2019s statement on BHS, here\u2019s a picture of Sir Philip Green\u2019s new superyacht: More details are emerging of payments made to Retail Acquisitions, which bought BHS in 2015 for \u00a31. Graham Ruddick and Sarah Butler report that more than \u00a325m was paid from BHS to its owner, Retail Acquisitions, in the 13 months between the department store\u2019s sale and it collapsing into administration. Sources with knowledge of BHS\u2019s finances say that the payments to Retail Acquisitions included \u00a32.8m in management fees, \u00a32.1m in salaries and wages, \u00a311m in legal and professional fees and \u00a310m in interest payments. Here\u2019s their full story: And if you are just joining us, here\u2019s the main news story on BHS collapsing into administration: Meanwhile, Simon Goodley has been looking into Dominic Chappell, the 49-year-old racing driver-turned-entrepreneur, who led the consortium that bought BHS from Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 last year. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 has closed down 0.8% or almost 50 points, at just shy of 6261. Miners and energy companies have pulled the wider index down as oil prices have slipped - Brent crude is down 0.7% at $44.8 per barrel. As we reported earlier, the news that BHS has collapsed into administration, did little to dent investor appetite for retailers\u2019 shares. Marks &amp; Spencer shares are up more than 1%, ASOS shares are up 0.9% and Boohoo is up 5.3%. But Debenhams shares are down 1% and Next is down 0.2%. Over on Wall Street it\u2019s been a subdued start to the week for US stocks. Hurt by weaker oil prices and jitters ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve decision on interest rates, the Dow Jones industrial average is down 0.6% at around 17,893 and the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.5% at 2,081. Earlier we heard from the head of shopworkers\u2019 union Usdaw, John Hannet, on how administrators will want to avoid repeating mistakes made after Woolworths\u2019 demise in 2008. Readers may remember that in 2012, 24,000 former staff of Woolworths were awarded compensation worth 60 days\u2019 pay because the stores had been closed without consultation after the chain collapsed. Nicholas Le Riche, employment partner at the law firm Bircham Dyson Bell says although BHS stores are still trading for now and a buyer for the company is being sought, \u201cit is likely that stores will be forced to close resulting in widespread redundancies.\u201d BHS will be expected to consult collectively with the Usdaw trade union and other relevant employee representatives, says Le Riche. He explains: The need to follow a fair process was illustrated by the collapse of Woolworths, which saw large claims over how the redundancy consultation had been conducted. On top of compensation for unfair dismissal, employees may also be entitled to up to 90 days\u2019 pay if there has been a failure in the collective consultation procedures. More commentary is coming in on how much, or how little, BHS\u2019s position is a function of the current retail climate. Gary Hobbs, senior equity analyst at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, says: \u201cWhilst conditions on the high street have been tough, as witnessed by the likes of Next, we suspect that the travails at BHS are as much a function of their financial position as they are a reflection of slower trading. \u201cWe do not envisage any material ramifications elsewhere for retailers, though there might be some work to do for the landlords of BHS\u2019 store portfolio.\u201d Some of BHS\u2019s retail rivals - with the notable exception of Next - seem to be faring well from its bad news on stock markets this afternoon. Connor Campbell, financial analyst spread betting company Spreadex comments: After teasing flatness at lunchtime the FTSE gave up the ghost as the day went on, reverting back to a 40 point loss as a dismal showing from its commodity stocks compounded the sense of unease that greeted BHS filing for administration. \u201cBHS\u2019 rivals have largely benefited from its collapse this Monday, be it online stores like ASOS and Boohoo (the latter seeing a 5% rise ahead of its preliminary results tomorrow), or similarly recognisable high street staples like Marks &amp; Spencer and Sports Direct. Interestingly Next bucked this trend, falling nearly 1.5% as the company\u2019s investors wondered if they were looking at the Ghost of High Street Future.\u201d Shares in Next are down around 1.2%, ASOS shares are up 0.5%, Boohoo is up 4.7%, Sports Direct is up 0.6% and Marks &amp; Spencer shares are up 0.8%. Back on Oxford Street, Damien Gayle, has been sounding out more shoppers on what went wrong at BHS. \u201cWhat\u2019s BHS - is that a sandwich?\u201d asked Jason Knight, 21, as he and his friends drank coffee outside Starbucks. He appeared to only be half joking. But his friend Amy West (pictured), 23, was at least aware of the retail chain\u2019s existence. Had she ever shopped there? \u201cI have, when I was a kid though, my nan used to take me there. Me and my nan used to pop into the shopping centre and she used to say: \u2018I just have to go into BHS\u2019.\u201d If you are just joining us, here\u2019s our latest news story on BHS collapsing into administration after failing to agree a last-minute deal to rescue the department store chain. Amid the the biggest failure on the high street since that of Woolworths in 2008, there are fears for the jobs of the BHS\u2019s 11,000 employees. The government is expected to make a statement on the failure of the 88-year-old retail group in parliament later this afternoon - probably around 5pm. On financial markets, it\u2019s been a lacklustre day for the FTSE 100 share index. The bluechips index is currently down around 44 points, or 0.7%, 6267. This week marks one year since the index hit its record closing leavel of 7,103. The FTSE is now down almost 12% from that high point. But Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown has been taking a closer look and notes that behind the headline drop in the index, a high proportion of UK companies and funds have prospered over the last year. One third of FTSE 100 companies have seen a share price rise since the index peaked and 36% of UK funds have made a positive return since the peak. Khalaf comments: Last April the market was riding high with the Footsie breaking new ground for the first time since 1999. Twelve months on, and the UK\u2019s headline index has had a reality check, losing a fifth of its value from peak to trough, as commodity and banking stocks plummeted. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get carried away with the twists and turns of the FTSE 100, but it\u2019s important to bear in mind the headline index is heavily influenced by the performance of the largest stocks, so doesn\u2019t give the full picture of how UK plc is doing. \u201cOne third of the stocks in the Footsie have risen over the last year, though they haven\u2019t been able to outweigh the black hole left by big oil, big mining, and big finance.\u201d Damien Gayle has been speaking to more shoppers on and around Oxford Street this afternoon and getting more of a sense of how UK consumers have fallen out of love with BHS. Hayden Clottey, 23, was browsing the boutiques of Carnaby Street, close to the BHS flagship store. Asked why he wasn\u2019t shopping in BHS, he said: I\u2019ve shopped there before. I used to have a friend who worked there. It\u2019s alright, you can get pretty much everything there. It\u2019s always a safe bet when you have to get presents for people - just the little packages of soap and things like that. I wouldn\u2019t selectively go in there I suppose.\u201d Jasmin Steiner, 20, and Holly Hicks Holcroft, 18, were also browsing Carnaby Street\u2019s boutiques. Asked how they felt about BHS\u2019s financial troubles, Hicks Holcroft replied: It doesn\u2019t really bother me - it\u2019s no Woolworths. Bring on change. \u201c I can remember going there with my nan. It was that sort of shop that you go to with your nan and your parents. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame I guess but it\u2019s making room for more stuff.\u201d Steiner said they had been out shopping at Monkey, a nearby boutique. We look at everything that\u2019s really expensive and then go to buy it in Primark,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve never bought anything from there [BHS]. Maybe we will go and look when everything\u2019s on sale, get my nan\u2019s Christmas presents for the next five years.\u201d Our financial editor Nils Pratley has some stern words of advice for Dominic Chappell, boss of BHS owner Retail Acquisitions, and he has some tough questions about the \u00a3571m deficit in the pension fund and the onus on previous BHS owner Sir Philip Green to sort out the mess. Nils notes how Chappell is \u201ccrassly missing the required tone\u201d when he writes in an email to staff: \u201cI would like to say it has been a real pleasure working with all of you on the BHS project, one I will never forget.\u201d \u201cNo, Mr Chappell, BHS was never a \u201cproject\u201d for the staff. It is how they earned their living and made plans to fund their retirement,\u201d writes Nils. On the pension problems, he continues: Given the odds against the BHS \u201cproject\u201d succeeding \u2013 there is an urgent question. How much responsibility for the \u00a3571m deficit in the pension fund lies with Sir Philip Green, who sold BHS to Chappell and his inexperienced crew for \u00a31 a year ago. The answer is clearly not none. The principle is clear: former owners cannot wash their hands of a pensions problem simply by selling a business for a token sum... Prepare to dig deep, Sir Philip: forget Topshop, the yachts (a new 300-footer is on the way), the fashion academy and the knighthood. Your contribution to retailing will be remembered chiefly by the decency, or otherwise, of your behaviour towards BHS pensioners. Read the full column here: Usdaw - the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers - has put out a statement calling for urgent talks with BHS. General secretary John Hannett has also drawn parallels with Woolworths as he urges the administrators to include workers in their decisions. Hannett says in a statement: \u201cThis is devastating news for the employees of BHS and we urge the company to change their attitude to trade unions and begin a dialogue with us at this difficult and worrying time. \u201cWe also urge the administrators and the company to comply with the law, consult with staff and Usdaw as the union for BHS workers. We don\u2019t want to see BHS staff locked out of discussions, sent to the back of the queue of creditors and treated like fixtures and fittings, as happened at Woolworths.\u201d \u201cThe Government needs to intervene now to protect taxpayers from picking up the bill for redundancy payments and safeguard the Pension Protection Fund. \u201cWe are in touch with our members working in BHS to reassure them that we will provide the support, advice and representation they require.\u201d Moving away from developments at BHS for a moment, jobs are also under threat at oil company Royal Dutch Shell. Shell is closing three UK offices, affecting 1,600 employees, including BG\u2019s headquarters in Reading, after its \u00a335bn takeover of the oil and gas company earlier this year, my colleague Nick Fletcher reports. The company has also begun a voluntary redundancy programme as part of a plan to cut 10,300 jobs across the merged group, comprising 7,500 from the original Shell business, as it attempts to cope with the recent plunge in oil prices, and another 2,800 following the merger with BG. The Reading office will close by the end of the year and the 800 staff based there will be offered the chance to move to Shell\u2019s central London base, which will house the entirety of the company\u2019s south-east England operations. Here\u2019s Nick\u2019s full story: The time of that statement to parliament has shifted again, now to the slightly earlier time of 5pm Time for a quick recap. Britain is facing its biggest retail failure since Woolworths collapsed in 2008. BHS, which employs 11,000 people, is now in the hands of administrators from Duff &amp; Phelps. They have promised to keep stores open, as they seek to sell the company as a going concern. Many analysts have warned that stores are likely to shut, with the best possibly \u2018cherry-picked\u2019 by rival retailers. Shoppers have told us of their sadness over BHS\u2019s demise. One lady warned that older shoppers will be disadvantaged if the brand vanishes from the high street. Younger consumers, though, say the company simply failed to move with the times. Business minister Anna Soubry is expected to give a statement to parliament about BHS this afternoon. It could be at 5.30pm Former owner, the retail chief Sir Philip Green, is also in the spotlight. The FT has highlighted how he took large dividends out of the company, before eventually selling it for \u00a31 last year. The Pensions Regulator has reportedly opened an investigation into BHS\u2019s pension scheme. It is currently facing a \u00a3571m black hole; Green could potentially be asked to cover some of this. The collapse of BHS is a personal blow to Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell: Our colleague Amelia Gentleman would like to hear from BHS staff: Sir Philip Green\u2019s 15-year ownership of BHS is in the spotlight today. The Financial Times\u2019s Alphaville site have published a handy explanation of how the Green family did rather well out of the retailer. FT: Would 11,000 BHS workers still have jobs if Tina Green hadn\u2019t siphoned \u00a31bn out of the business? Here\u2019s a flavour: Here, in very rough terms, is how the finances worked. It\u2019s an open question as to whether, with a little less financial engineering, this business might yet have survived. Green, a short man with a famous temper, acquired BHS (on behalf of his wife) for a pittance back in 2000. The store chain was in dire shape, but was conceivably worth more than he had paid. So Green booked circa \u00a3100m of \u2018negative\u2019 goodwill through the P&amp;L, declaring BHS to be surprisingly profitable. Magic. The parent company was then loaded with debt and the bulk of the cash was sent, via dividends, to Tina in Monaco. Precious little went into BHS, which continued to struggle.... Eventually, Green sold the group for \u00a31. But he\u2019d also built a retail empire with Top Shop, of course, helping to fund those super-yachts..... Then again.... Update: business minister Anna Soubry will speak to parliament about the BHS crisis, at around 4.30pm.... BHS vouchers can still be used to part-purchase goods, reports Sky News\u2019s Dharshini David: We mentioned earlier that Which? have urged people to spend gift vouchers immediately, they are treated as unsecured creditors once a firm enters administration. This is obviously hugely frustrating for people who have received vouchers - particularly if a retailer goes belly-up just after Christmas. Insolvency trade body R3 explains why it\u2019s a tough decision for administrators: Accepting vouchers could: Hurt other creditors by reducing the value of assets available for other creditors (by reducing stock); Deter potential buyers who may not wish to take on the obligation to honour vouchers; Reduce the value of an offer for the retailer given the size of the potential liability. But not accepting vouchers could: Damage the relationship between the business and its customers; Damage confidence in the business among potential investors. The government is expected to make a statement on BHS\u2019s fall into administration in the next few hours. It will either come from business secretary Sajid Javid, or small business minister Anna Soubry: BHS staff look downbeat as they walk in and out of the company\u2019s HQ this lunchtime. Those approached by the Guardian refused to comment on the firm\u2019s financial situation, as the administrators take control of the firm. Meanwhile, TV cameras stood trained on the sliding doors and journalists clutching notepads shuffled to keep warm. BREAKING: BHS has officially fallen into administration, and is now under the control of Duff &amp; Phelps. Here\u2019s the official statement, which confirms they will keep BHS stores open while they try to sell the group as a \u2018going concern\u2019. Philip Duffy and Benjamin Wiles, Managing Directors at Duff &amp; Phelps have today been appointed Joint Administrators of BHS (The Group). The Group has been undergoing restructuring and, as has been widely reported, the shareholders have been in negotiations to find a buyer for the business. These negotiations have been unsuccessful. In addition property sales have not materialised as expected in both number and value. Consequently, as a result of a lower than expected cash balance, the Group is very unlikely to meet all contractual payments. The Directors therefore have no alternative but to put the Group into administration to protect it for all creditors. The Group will continue to trade as usual whilst the Administrators seek to sell it as a going concern. Further announcements will be made as appropriate in due course. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our updated news story on the BHS crisis: BHS is going into administration after failing to agree a last-minute deal to rescue the department store chain. The collapse of the retailer, which employs 11,000 people, will be the biggest failure on the high street since the demise of Woolworths in 2008. Staff have been told this morning that BHS has called in Duff &amp; Phelps as administrators and should formally enter insolvency procedure today. The formal administration will begin when it is approved by the high court, a statement from Duff &amp; Phelps is expected shortly. The collapse of the 88 year old BHS presents another problem for government as it attempts to save thousands of jobs in the steel industry. BHS has failed to secure emergency funding that it needed to pay wages and its rent.... Full story here: Sajid Javid, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills, has tweeted that the government is doing its bit: Javid has a lot on his plate - he\u2019s already trying to avoid the loss of 4,000 jobs in the steel industry. Having bought BHS for just \u00a31 last year, will Retail Acquisitions end up in profit despite administration? Pension regulators could force former owner Sir Philip Green to help cover the BHS pensions black hole. Last month, the Mail on Sunday reported that they\u2019re considering asking Sir Philip for at least \u00a3300m to cover the \u00a3571m pension black hole. As Nick Hood pointed out this morning, business owners can\u2019t just sell up and abandon pensioners. And after taking an estimated \u00a3400m dividends out of BHS, Green is in the spotlight. Especially as he\u2019s taking delivery of a new \u00a3100m superyacht - his third! Dubbed Lionheart (the yacht, not Sir Philip), it will apparently be as long as a football pitch, and four storeys high, with all the swimming pools and jacuzzis one could ever need. Dr Gordon Fletcher of the University of Salford says BHS has failed to keep up with retail trends, or lose its image as a Baby Boomers store. The utilitarian model of retailing everything within one physical store simply does not appeal to younger generations and along with the soaring cost of servicing pensions the fate of this stalwart appears sealed. Being cheap, but not cheap enough to compete, coupled with being a landmark brand while not offering anything distinctive produces that particularly bland region of retailing that BHS has increasingly occupied. Mrs Condon from Camden has emerged from BHS\u2019s Oxford Street store carrying bulging bags. And like Louise Simpson, she\u2019s bought some cushions - apparently a BHS staple. Mrs Condon tells us that the failure of BHS was tragic: \u201cI love that store. We don\u2019t go down here very often, but I\u2019ve always loved BHS. It\u2019s got a variety of things, whatever you need it\u2019s there for you.\u201d Asked what she had bought, Condon, who gave her age as in her 70s, replied: \u201cI wanted some cushions, some bath towels, sheets and bits and bobs you don\u2019t need to know about.\u201d Back on Oxford Street, Louise Simpson, 40, from Wakefield is passing time with her dad, Bill Hardy, while her daughter had an interview for a place at Rada, the nearby performing arts college. She emerged from BHS with shopping bags bulging with new living room cushions. Asked about the business going bust, she tells Damien Gayle that: \u201cI think it\u2019s quite a sad day to be honest.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure of the reasons for the business failing, but Bill, 69, cut in with \u201clack of customers.\u201d He explains: \u201cWhen you go in there there\u2019s not many people walking around buying stuff. Back to the old saying: people haven\u2019t got the money.\u201d Louise adds: \u201cTo be honest it\u2019s internet shopping for me. It\u2019s age. Parents will probably just keep shopping around but we will just Google it. I think the Internet has got a lot to say for a lot of shops (which are closing down). Probably won\u2019t be the last either.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to put a bet on which one will be next,\u201d Bill added. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame to think that they are going under considering how long they have been going.\u201d Meanwhile, the Oxford Street store seemed to be attracting plenty of interest. Plenty of shoppers went through its swing doors. Few however emerged with any purchases. Jon Copestake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says BHS\u2019s current owners have not performed well: Having purchased the retail chain for just \u00a31 [in March 2015], Retail Acquisitions has shown little appetite or acumen for retail management, despite its name. Its owner Dominic Chappelle is a former racing driver with more experience of bankruptcy than retail. In addition to his hefty salary he has been involved in a number of questionable transactions, such as reportedly diverting funds borrowed by BHS to its directors while pushing landlords to accept rent reductions. On the retail side a successful repositioning of the brand and product portfolio has not materialised and much of the company\u2019s recent strategy has centred on selling off prime properties to keep creditors at bay. Guardian Witness would like to hear from BHS staff, and from former workers worries about their pension: Retail commentator Paul Mitchell sees more trouble ahead: A 66-year-old woman from St. John\u2019s Wood, who declined to give her name, said she always gets her clothes from BHS. \u201cI\u2019m so upset!\u201d She exclaimed when Damien asked about the shops financial troubles. \u201cThe prices are reasonable and I just like it. Marks and Spencer are too upmarket now, all it is is business suits and business blouses and they are totally out of touch with people like me. \u201cI\u2019ve just bought a swimming costume the other week. It\u2019s \u00a328 in here and \u00a335 in Marks, and I got 25% off so it came down to about \u00a310 difference. It\u2019s things like that. Maybe you could say BHS are probably for my age group but there\u2019s some nice stuff for the younger generation as well.\u201d Today, she said, she was going in to buy sandals for a forthcoming holiday. And she agreed that BHS\u2019s demise would be the end of a British institution. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real, real shame because to me John Lewis and Debenhams are too expensive now. Primark\u2019s quality is not that great, plus they are more for the younger generation. There\u2019s not many shops now that cater for the older woman.\u201d BHS\u2019s owner has confirmed that the administrators have arrived, reports Ben Martin of the Telegraph: The press are gathering on Oxford Street.... This is why BHS has struggled to find new funding: Andri Antoniades, 59, from Cyprus, and her husband are browsing the Oxford Street shops during a holiday to London. They already know about BHS\u2019s problems. And speaking to Damien Gayle, they raised the topic of Philip Green\u2019s \u00a31.2bn dividend [from his Arcadia empire in 2005] and his subsequent sale of the business for \u00a31 last year. Andri said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good and this is what happens at the end of the day. He brought in a famous model [Caprice] he was trying to upmarket the look, but obviously it\u2019s gone a bit wrong.\u201d The Antoniades didn\u2019t plan to buy anything from BHS, just take a look. Her husband broke in with a smile: \u201cWe\u2019ve just come to see it before it collapsed!\u201d Andri added: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be able to say I was there...\u201d Nicolette Kadzeya, 39, was waiting with her three children outside BHS\u2019s store on Oxford Street when it opened. She believes the company has failed to keep pace with the changing times, my colleague Damien Gayle reports: Kadzeya had read about the firms\u2019s problems but hoped it would open because she had to exchange an unwanted item \u201cI think the problem with BHS is that this branch is very up to date but if you go to the branch in Surrey Quays it\u2019s as if you have gone back in time. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve gone back to the mid-90s. \u201cSome of the branches which are outside of London are not that well maintained. It\u2019s a bit old fashioned as well. They are good for school shoes but it\u2019s not really up to date.\u201d She couldn\u2019t talk for long though.... \u201cI think they are open so I have to make it fast,\u201d Kadzeya said as she wheeled her buggy inside. BHS\u2019s store in Oxford Street doesn\u2019t look terribly busy, but at least it\u2019s open for business this morning: A BHS spokesperson has confirmed that the administration process is underway: BHS\u2019s social media team are doing their best to remain upbeat today, and ready to help: Customers are showing their support too: We\u2019re expecting BHS to file for administration as soon as the UK courts are open for business: Newsflash: German business confidence is weaker than expected, according to the latest survey from the IFO thinktank. IFO\u2019s business confidence reading has dipped to 106.6, from 106.7 last month, with firms reporting that conditions have become tougher. Anyone holding BHS gift vouchers should spend them right now, says Alex Neill, head of campaigns at consumer group Which. She points out that administrators are not obliged to accept gift vouchers - even though the company has already received the monay for them. Which explains: When a company goes into administration the administrators get certain powers to help turn the company around. These powers enable them to refuse to accept vouchers if they consider this is in the best interests of the company. Keep an eye on the administration progresses as the administrators may initially decide not to take vouchers and then later decide they will. The crisis at BHS highlights wider problems in the retail sector , argues Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital. It\u2019s not just BHS that\u2019s suffering - shares are down sector-wide over the last 12 months \u2013 reflecting investor caution about an industry that\u2019s increasingly dependent on cheap credit and little else to drive it. The concern is that if interest rates rise \u2013 which they will have to do sooner or later - consumers will quickly tighten their belts and dispense with their credit cards. Meanwhile, retailers\u2019 margins are being squeezed by the new living wage, which is driving up wage costs when there is little sign of meaningful sales price growth. BHS may have been another Woolworths that struggled to adapt to the new retail world. But the same pressures that squeezed the life out of BHS are being felt across the UK retail sector today. Trouble on the high street is usually a sign of more deep-seated problems in the UK\u2019s economy.\u201d Austin Reed, another high street name, went into administration last week too, despite the patronage of IMF chief Christine Lagarde.... BHS staff are due to learn at 11am that their jobs are at \u201cvery high risk\u201d after efforts to create a rescue deal over the weekend failed, says the BBS\u2019s Simon Jack. Administrators Duff &amp; Phelps are lined up to take control, and will try to sell BHS as a going concern. That will be tough, though, as the company needs \u00a3100m of fresh funding. BHS is paying the price for not keeping track with its customers\u2019 changing needs, says Phil Dorrell, Partner, Retail Remedy retail consultants. Dorrell agrees that the company\u2019s better stores will be \u2018cherry-picked\u2019: When the administrators are called in, there won\u2019t be a retailer to buy BHS wholesale. Expect a piecemeal sale of specific sites in strategic locations to John Lewis possibly or Sports Direct or Next. Sadly this is probably the beginning of the end for BHS on our High Streets. It would take a brave and innovative business to buy the brand and turn it into an ongoing concern. BHS can trace its history back to 1928, when it was created as a British rival to Woolworths. It floated five years later, spending 65 years on the stock market until retail magnate Philip Green took it over in 2000. Our BHS timeline has the details: Nick Hood adds that BHS\u2019s profitable stores will probably cherry-picked, perhaps by Sports Direct. That would save some jobs, but as he tells the Today Programme: Ultimately, we\u2019ve got 11,000 jobs at risk here and the pensions of 20,000 people. It\u2019s a disaster. The pension fund currently faces a \u00a3576m deficit, but that would \u2018escalate\u2019 if BHS fails and the deficit is \u201ccrystallised\u201d. Q: Could they go after Philip Green, the former owner of BHS, who sold BHS for a pound last year? Pension liabilities are like Hotel California, Hood says, you can check out but never leave. The Pension Protection Fund will be looking very closely, and could issue a contribution notice to people who have been connected with the fund, Hood adds. The initial offer I believe Sir Philip made of \u00a340m, plus a \u00a340m loan on top, won\u2019t cut the mustard. Inevitably, a much higher contribution will be required. BHS\u2019s options are \u201cdistinctly limited\u201d as it totters on the brink of administration, warns Nick Hood, business risk adviser at the insolvency practitioners Opus. Speaking on the Today Programe, Hood says BHS has suffered from years of serious underinvestment, and lost over \u00a3400m over the last six years. Retail these days is all about heavy investment in staying up with the trend, online offerings, mobile offerings. None of this has happened at BHS. This has awful exchoes of what you and I were discussing in 2008 over the demise of Woolworths. Another retail business that hasn\u2019t stayed up with the times. One of Britain\u2019s longest-running retail chains is on the brink of collapse. It\u2019s almost 90 years since British Home Stores was founded. And BHS could fall into administration this morning, as hopes of a last-minute deal with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct fade. With 11,000 jobs at risk, plus the pensions of tens of thousands of former workers, it could be the biggest retail failure since Woolworths eight years My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: BHS has failed to secure emergency funding that it needed to pay wages and its rent. The restructuring firm Duff &amp; Phelps is set to be appointed as administrators on Monday, unless \u00a360m can be found to keep BHS afloat in the short term. Darren Topp, the chief executive of BHS, said: \u201cWhat was on the table wasn\u2019t sufficient and we have been working in the last few days to fill the gap.\u201d The pound has hit its highest level since early March this morning, after President Barack Obama made his dramatic intervention into the EU referendum debate. Sterling jumped by more than half a cent in early trading against the US dollar, hitting $1.4475 for the first time in five weeks. Obama\u2019s warnings against Brexit have enraged the \u201cOut campaign\u201d, but traders are calculating that they could sway undecided voters ahead of the June 23 referendum. On Friday night, the US president insisted that Britain would be at the \u201cback of the queue\u201d to arrange a trade deal with America. Later he said it could take a decade - comments reiterated by Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Economists expect the pound to slump if the public do vote to leave the EU, so today\u2019s move suggests the Remain camp are on the front foot. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The pound was among one of the best performing currencies last week and has continued to rally this morning against the US dollar and euro as markets perceive that the recent intervention by US President Obama, as well as his possible successor Hillary Clinton has shifted the odds towards the \u201cStay \u201c camp in the latest polling indicators, dealing a blow to \u201cBrexit\u201d campaigners. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Traders are bracing for a busy week, with new growth data from Britain (on Wednesday), the US (Thursday) and the eurozone (on Friday). Both the eurozone and the UK are expected to have grown by just 0.4% during the first quarter of 2016, due to domestic weaknesses and the slowdown in emerging markets. And America might do even worse, with quarterly growth of just 0.15% expected. This morning, new German business confidence figure are released at 9am BST, by the IFO thinktank. It\u2019s expected to show a small improvement in business expectations, from 106.7 to 107.1. Then we get a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s industrial sector at 11am, from the CBI. Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to open mixed, after falling around 1% on Friday",

                "bodyText":"As the US Federal Reserve holds its latest two day meeting there have been more signs the the world\u2019s largest economy is not exactly firing on all cylinders: On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. For those wondering what was happening with the Greek bailout talks and whether there would be a new Eurogroup meeting this week as promised (threatened?), there\u2019s this from a correspondent for Greece\u2019s Kathimerini: Positive updates from the likes of Standard Chartered, BP and Whitbread gave some support to leading shares in London, but other European markets were more mixed. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Significant indecision is evident within global stocks today, as the release of data fails to spark any form of directional volatility. With the [US Federal Reserve] and the Bank of Japan due to take the stand once more tomorrow, there is good reason for today\u2019s hesitancy, given the unpredictable nature of financial markets around these times. A positive start to the day for US markets does little to reflect what has been a largely discouraging batch of data, revealing falling consumer confidence, weaker-than-expected services sector growth and yet another fall in core durable goods. It is clearly a case of bad news is good news as any signs of a US economic slowdown would likely put the buffers on any plans for the Fed to tighten. However, it is worth considering that there is something wrong about a stock market near record highs amid stuttering Chinese growth, tumbling US earnings, an energy price crisis and inflation at rock bottom. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 23.60 points or 0.38% at 6284.52 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.34% to 10,259.59 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.28% lower at 4533.18 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 1.45% to 18,670.41 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.56% at 9283.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.34% to 599.59 Ahead of Apple\u2019s results and the central bank meetings, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 15 points or 0.08%. BHS is not the only corporate problem facing the UK government of course. Steel is still very much on the agenda, and earlier today prime minister David Cameron visited the troubled Port Talbot steel works. The Press Association reports some reaction to the PM turning up: Dai Bowyer, steelworker and Unite executive committee member, said: \u201cMyself and fellow trade union representatives had a constructive meeting with the Prime Minister where we impressed upon him the need to ensure that UK steelworkers have a level playing field on which to compete with our global competitors. \u201cThis included the need for the Government to go further in tackling sky high energy costs and the dumping of cheap Chinese steel, as well as help with high business rates. \u201cDuring the conversation we welcomed the recent commitment by his Government to take a public stake in the UK steel industry, stressing the importance of steel to Britain\u2019s manufacturing base. Clearly impressed by what he saw, we trust that David Cameron will keep his word in doing everything he can to support steel in Port Talbot and the rest of the UK.\u201d Meanwhile US oil giant Exxon Mobil has had its credit rating cut by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s to reflect the plunge in crude prices: Back with the US consumer confidence figures, which come before the latest Federal Reserve decision on Wednesday and Thursday\u2019s US GDP numbers. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: While remaining steadfast, American consumers don\u2019t appear to be wildly optimistic about the future which will help inform [Fed chair] Yellen and Co.\u2019s decision on interest rates tomorrow. All eyes now turn to the Q1 GDP figures on Thursday, where the first effect of Yellen\u2019s December interest rate rise will be seen. Conservative MP Richard Fuller, who on Monday described leaving the idea of the taxpayer picking up the bill for the BHS pensions shortfall as \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d, has demanded Sir Philip Green clarify his involvement in the demise of the retailer. He said (quotes from PA): Green and Arcadia need to put out a statement immediately clarifying their position. He has a responsibility, a duty. Arcadia should be made to make public the documents and correspondence between themselves and Retail Acquisitions so that we can ascertain if the correct due diligence was undertaken in terms of there being enough cash left in the business and to cover the pension liability. If it\u2019s found that the correct due diligence was not undertaken, the Sir Philip will face serious consequences. The Press Association have confirmed that a letter of invitation will soon be winging its way to Sir Philip Green. Asked whether Sir Philip would be called before the committee, Mr Field told the Press Association: \u201cI am sure he will be invited to give evidence.\u201d Breaking: Sir Philip Green is being called to parliament to be questioned by the Work and Pensions Committee over the collapse of BHS. This follows committee chair Frank Field\u2019s decision to open an inquiry into the impact of BHS\u2019s administration (see earlier post). They will investigate how BHS\u2019s 571m pension deficit will affect Britain\u2019s Pension Protection Fund, a rescue scheme funded by contributions from other pension pots. The Wall Street Journal has a good piece on how many pension funds are struggling right now. The Collapse of BHS is a Warning for the U.K\u2019s Faltering Pension Schemes Here\u2019s a flavour: The problems for BHS\u2019s pension scheme are particularly acute, but it\u2019s not alone by any means. Schemes all across Europe are being squeezed by two pincers: an increasing number of elderly people relative to the working population, and shrinking interest income. As long as those two trends continue, BHS isn\u2019t going to be the last company to struggle under the weight of its pension liabilities. And this graph underlines why the problem is getting worse: More disappointing US economic data: Christmas seems to come round earlier every year in the shops. But at BHS\u2019s store in Friars Square, Aylesbury, staff are still trying to shift last year\u2019s stock.... Back to BHS... and our veteran political commentator Michael White has written about how our elected masters have a blind spot when it comes to business bosses. Here\u2019s a flavour of his latest Political Briefing. BHS paid Phil and Tina [Green] a lot of rent (\u00a311m a year) on its 164 stores. Crafty or what! It\u2019s the same story we heard when the Southern Cross care homes group collapsed in 2011. It had been financially re-engineered after being sold to Blackstone, the US private equity crowd. The homes were sold as a property business, then leased back at high rents by the care business. Together with falling local authority fees for elderly patients \u2013 that\u2019s austerity for you \u2013 it bust the model. The scandal at Boots exposed this month by the Guardian is quite different, but the idea is the same. Sweat the assets while loading the core business with debt, so you can move on and do it again. It\u2019s the task of governments everywhere to hold the line, to see such activities are robustly regulated, their entrepreneurs honoured when they do well by society as well as themselves, jailed if they commit fraud, condemned when their legal manoeuvres are transparently immoral as some of King Phil\u2019s have been \u2013 despite protests of injured innocence. Alas, Blair gave him the knighthood he wanted for \u201cservices to the retail industry\u201d. And David Cameron? After King Phil repaid Labour for its obsequiousness by publicly backing the Tories in 2010, the new PM asked him to review government spending and procurement. Phil reported back that there\u2019s a lot of waste. Angels wept. Here\u2019s the full piece: The latest economic data from America is a little disappointing, showing that the global economy may be weaker than hoped. Orders for durable goods, such as computers, kitchen equipment and even aeroplanes, rose by just 0.8% in March after a 3.1% slump in February. Economists expected a 1.8% recovery, so they\u2019re now a little worried. Separately, US house price growth has cooled to a 5.4% annual rate in February, down from 5.7% in January. Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s official spokeswoman has declined to comment on criticisms of Sir Philip Green: She told today\u2019s Lobby briefing that the government is concentrating on helping BHS staff. I\u2019ve taken the quotes from the Press Association: \u201cIt is a worrying time for BHS staff and their families. We have now got the Pensions Protection Fund carrying out an assessment. It\u2019s usual in this type of case for the Insolvency Service to also look into what\u2019s happened. I think we need to let these assessments take place first. \u201cWe are currently focused on what this means for BHS staff moving forward and what the Government can do to support them.\u201d It\u2019s official: high street tailor Austin Reed has followed BHS into administration. The move leaves around 1,100 workers facing redundancy. Administrators are hoping to sell the company as a going concern, so the stores are staying open for now. Here\u2019s the full story: The company is offering some chunky discounts today.... Bad news for BHS: property agents have warned that a quarter of its high street stores would be hard to let to new tenants, while only 8% are in \u2018prime\u2019 locations. That undermines the chances of a white knight buyer snapping up the whole company, argues Joanna Bourke of the Evening Standard. More here. John Mann\u2019s call for Sir Philip Green to lose his knighthood, unless he hands back \u00a3400m of dividend payments, puts more pressure on the Arcadia boss. Julie Palmer, regional manager at business restructuring specialists Begbies Traynor, says it is becoming an issue of fairness and morality, not just legality. She told the BBC earlier today that: \u201c[Sir Philip] is an astute businessman, I imagine he was advised and that all of that was done properly. There\u2019s a moral issue that if we are facing a pensions deficit of \u00a3571 million do we look beyond the boundaries of legality at propriety instead? I understand he already is in discussions to make a voluntary payment which suggests he is aware. \u201cI don\u2019t think the administrator will [bring moral pressure into it] but there are MPs already on the case. There are calls about whether he should be able to keep his knighthood. That\u2019s all part of the pressure that is beginning to build.\u201d Via the Independent. Breaking away from BHS again, Prime minister David Cameron is making a surprise visit to the troubled steelworks in Port Talbot, South Wales, today. More than 4,000 jobs are still at risk at the Port Talbot side, following Indian conglomerate Tata\u2019s decision to sell up. The government is offering to take a 25% stake in the steelworkers, plus debt relief, in an attempt to find a buyer. Cameron\u2019s visit may be designed to show that Westminster hasn\u2019t forgotten about the steel crisis. As it happens, there\u2019s a BHS store up the coast in Swansea - perhaps the PM could pop in there afterwards and offer workers his support.... The House of Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee has announced an inquiry into BHS\u2019s pensions deficit. The committee will examine how the UK\u2019s Pension Protection Fund will cope with BHS\u2019s \u00a3571m pension deficit. The PPF steps in when a company cannot handle its pension liabilities, and is funded by levies on other pension schemes. So BHP\u2019s costs will Committee chair Frank Field says the BHS crisis has raised serious questions: \u201cWe need as a Committee to look at the Pension Protection Fund and how the receipt of pension liabilities of BHS will impact on the increases in the levy that will now be placed on all other eligible employers to finance the scheme. We will then need to judge whether the law is strong enough to protect future pensioners\u2019 contracts in occupational schemes.\u201d Yesterday, MPs on all sides of the House of Commons expressed concern over the BHS crisis, particularly the pensions issue. Conservative MP Steve Baker argued that the free market was seriously undermined when vast profits are privatised, and then similarly larges losses are swiftly dumped on taxpayers or pensioners. And fellow Tory Richard Fuller said dumping pensions obligations on others was \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. Sir Philip Green has not enjoyed reading today\u2019s newspapers: What did the Mirror do to earn such shocking opprobrium? Well, today\u2019s edition describes Green thus: He\u2019s the epitome of a self-made man or, depending upon your point of view, an icon of unmitigated greed. A foul-mouthed, tough-talking billionaire whose number-one aim is making money, and woe betide anyone who gets in his way. Later adding..... When he turned 50, his wife Tina reportedly gave him a solid gold Monopoly set. He celebrated the birthday by flying 200 pals to Cyprus for a lavish toga party, with Tom Jones entertaining them. Green himself was dressed, according to business journalist Jeff Randall, as \u201ca physically challenged Nero\u201d. And for his 60th, he flew 150 guests to Mexico, allocated each 15 bottles of Pol Roger \u2013 worth \u00a3250 each \u2013 and had Stevie Wonder and the Beach Boys perform. Here\u2019s the full story: BHS boss Philip Green built his empire on cost-cutting and ruthless deals Here\u2019s a reminder of just how much money the Greens received from BHS during their 15-year ownership: Labour MP John Mann has called for Sir Philip Green to be stripped of his knighthood, unless he returns the dividends paid to his family from BHS. Mann argues that Green should hand back the \u00a3400m which he received from BHS, to help cover the \u00a3571m pension black hole. In a statement, Mann says: \u201cSir Philip Green and his family have made millions out of BHS and its hard working staff. He took over a company with a healthy pension pot, yet when he sold BHS a black hole had appeared in its fund.\u201d \u201cSir Philip Green has taken over \u00a3400 million out of the company and now must be held responsible for the actions that were taken under his stewardship.\u201d \u201cThere is a very simple and honourable solution to this crisis; repay the dividends, live up to the name he has chosen for his new yacht, \u2018Lionheart\u2019, or lose his knighthood.\u201d It\u2019s rare to see a Labour MP agree with the Daily Mail, but on this issue Mann is in complete agreement with the mid-market paper (see earlier post). The pound hit a 10-week high this morning, as bookmakers slash the odds of Britain remaining in the European Union. Sterling has gained almost a cent against the US dollar, to $1.457, as traders anticipate that the Remain campaign will win the June 23 referendum. Another high street name, fashion retailer Austin Reed, is collapsing into administration this morning. The announcement could come at 11am, we hear. In another triumph for free market capitalism, Scottish Power has been slapped with an \u00a318m fine for unacceptably poor customer service. Angela Monaghan explains: Dermot Nolan, Ofgem\u2019s chief executive, said Scottish Power\u2019s treatment of gas and electricity customers had been \u201cdiscernibly worse\u201d than its peers. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he added: \u201cThis is a significant amount of money. It\u2019s basically because Scottish Power failed to treat its customers fairly over a sustained period of time.\u201d The chair of the BHS pension fund trustees has revealed he was surprised that Retail Acquisitions wanted to buy BHS last year, given its pension deficit. Chris Martin told the Today Programme that: It\u2019s always difficult when a company is sold with a large pension deficit. You wonder why the purchasers would want to buy the company. But they did. And we engaged with them and we talked to them about the funding obligations to the scheme. Unfortunately, the trading of the business meant it couldn\u2019t support any contributions to the scheme and hence it\u2019s now in the position it\u2019s in. The good news, if there is any good news, for pension scheme members is that the PFF is in place and supporting their pension obligations. Martin insists, though, that the pension scheme hasn\u2019t dramatically deteriorated in the last year. The BBC\u2019s business editor Simon Jack has been outlining Philip Green\u2019s defence against criticism over the BHS crisis. He ran this company for 15 years, he employed thousands and thousands of people, and he was a great force for UK fashion retail and made it a big force both here in the UK and the US. It doesn\u2019t look good as he jumps on his yacht to go back to Monaco with his arm around Kate Moss, leaving employees and pensioners worried about it. But he\u2019s not a natural corporate raider. He\u2019s not necessarily the vulture type of capitalist that people may have portrayed him in the last couple of days. Green does have questions to answer, though, for selling BHS to an \u201cunknown bunch of brokers, financiers and lawyers\u201d They didn\u2019t invest in the company but proved very adept at getting money out of it, Jack points out. \u00a325m, by our maths. With profits up 12%, Whitbread is profiting from Britain\u2019s \u201clong working hours culture\u201d. So argues Steve Clayton, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown: \u201cCosta is busily slaking the nation\u2019s never ending thirst for caffeine; think of it as an investment play on the UK\u2019s long hours work culture. Premier Inn is a great product; a clean comfortable room, in a good location at a sensible price. With over 60,000 rooms in the estate, it is the clear market leader in the UK branded budget hotel sector. Labour MP Owen Smith, the Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, isn\u2019t impressed with BP\u2019s results: (that loss was on a \u2018replacement cost\u2019 basis, adjusting for moves in the oil price but not stripping out one-off charges) Over in the City, shares in Whitbread have jumped 3.6% to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard after it reported a 12% rise in underlying pretax profits. BP are close behind, up 3.1% despite suffering an 80% slump in earnings. Investors are relieved that it wasn\u2019t even worse, and pleased to hear CEO Bob Dudley promising further spending cuts... The Times have pinned the blame for BHS\u2019s failure firmly on current owner Dominic Chappell. The twice-bankrupt racing driver simply lacked the skills to turn the group around after buying it from Philip Green for \u00a31, argues Deirdre Hipwell. Here\u2019s a flavour: Sir Philip Green said that he had sold BHS \u2018100 percent clean\u2019, adding: \u201cIf I give you my plane, right, and you tell me you\u2019re a great driver and you crash it into the first f****** mountain, is that my fault? For many in the market, the answer to that question is \u2018yes\u2019, arguing that it was his fault for selling a fragile business to Mr Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions, which appears to have had neither the skills nor means to save it A veteran propert expert who declined to deal with BHS under its new owners said: \u201cYou have to accept the fact that Chappell is a buffoon\u201d More here: \u2018Buffoon\u2019 drove struggling retailer into ground Four UK newspapers are leading on BHS\u2019s collapse into administration: Today\u2019s newspapers are packed with criticism of BHS\u2019s present, and former owners. In the Daily Mail, Alex Brummer has outlined what a poor state the company was in, by the time Sir Philip Green sold it for a pound last year. BHS had nowhere to go but the knacker\u2019s yard. All it consisted of was an outdated, declining enterprise, with a collection of unattractive, near valueless shop leases and a liability in its pension fund of \u00a3571 million. By selling when he did, Green put enough distance between himself and the new owners before the all-but-inevitable end arrived. By the time he sold, he had ensured that most of the real value of the business, including the \u00a340 million freehold of BHS\u2019s imposing headquarters in Marylebone in West London, from where Green liked to hold court, was owned directly by his family. And that leaves BHS workers facing a 10% cut to their pensions, if they are bailed out by the UK\u2019s pension protection fund. Brummer argues that Sir Philip should pay the ultimate price - demotion to the ranks - if he doesn\u2019t reach deep into his pocket to cover the \u00a3571m pension black hole. If he doesn\u2019t stump up, however, the knighthood bestowed upon him by Tony Blair \u2014 for Green\u2019s donations to flagship fashion academy schools \u2014 could be taken away from him. Veteran pensions and welfare campaigner Frank Field MP has called for Green to lose his knighthood in the manner of Fred Goodwin, the disgraced former boss of the Royal Bank of Scotland. It would be the ultimate humiliation if Sir Philip were to join the select company of business people stripped of the honours of which they had once been so proud. The recent slump in oil and gas prices has sent profits at oil giant BP slumping by almost 80%. The company has reported an underlying replacement cost profit of $532 million, from $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2015. That\u2019s despite slashing its capital expenditure bill by $500m, as it cuts back on new projects. Analysts had feared a loss. And chief executive Bob Dudley, who suffered a humiliating shareholder rebellion over his \u00a313m pay package last week, claims the situation is improving. He says: \u201cdespite the challenging environment, we are driving towards our near-term goal of rebalancing BP\u2019s cash flows.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today, we\u2019ll be tracking the BHS crisis again. Eleven thousand jobs are on the line at its 164 stores, in the biggest retail failure since Woolworths in 2008. And criticism is mounting against firm\u2019s owners, Retail Acquisitions, and former boss Sir Philip Green, over a fiasco that could leave the taxpayer covering BHS\u2019s pension blackhole. Today\u2019s Guardian has splashed on the discovery that Retail Acquisitions have received a tasty \u00a325m since acquiring the high street chain barely a year ago. Sources with knowledge of BHS\u2019s finances have told the Guardian that more than \u00a325m was paid from BHS to Retail Acquisitions in the past 13 months. This included \u00a32.8m in management fees, \u00a32.1m in salaries and wages, \u00a311m in legal and professional fees and \u00a310m in interest payments. The man behind Retail Acquisitions is Dominic Chappell, a former racing driver who has been declared bankrupt twice. Chappell owns 90% of Retail Acquisitions,which bought BHS for \u00a31 from Green in March 2015. Green was heavily criticised by MPs in parliament last night, with talk of \u2018serious questions to answer\u2019 and \u2018the unacceptable face of capitalism\u2019. He\u2019s now facing questions over how his family took out \u00a3400m in dividends from BHS before selling it. They\u2019ve certainly got some fun out of the cash. As Sarah Butler explains: Even after the financial crisis hit the UK economy in 2008, the Greens have partied on. The family enjoy several weeks a year at the exclusive Barbados resort Sandy Lane, where they can hang out with friends such as Simon Cowell. In 2012, the family apparently shelled out more than \u00a33m to fly 150 guests \u2013 including Cowell, Kate Moss, Holly Valance, and her partner, the property developer Nick Candy \u2013 to Mexico\u2019s Yucatan peninsula for Green\u2019s 60th birthday party. Rihanna and Stevie Wonder were reportedly flown in to provide the entertainment. But that was a relatively muted affair compared to Green\u2019s 50th birthday bash, for which he chartered a private jet to fly 200 guests, including journalists and other business associates, to Cyprus for a three-day toga party at a cost of \u00a350m.... Also coming up... It\u2019s the start of the oil reporting season, with BP releasing results for the last quarter. Whitbread, the firm behind Premier Inns and Costa Coffee, are also updating the City. There\u2019s no significant European economic data today, but we do get the latest US durable goods orders (for March) at 1.30pm BST, followed by US consumer confidence report at 3pm BST. Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to inch higher this morning, after two days of falls. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

The country has still not got back on its feet, even though it has received hundreds of billions in emergency loans. When will the madness end?</strong></p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> Clearly, last year was an economic setback for Greece. Now everyone is aware that there can be no growth without reforms. And what the country and its citizen need above all is growth. Greece has implemented many reforms in the past months and is committed to the path of reforms.</p> <p><strong>BILD: Is the euro a part of the solution for Greece, or a part of the problem?</strong></p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> Greece\u2019s challenges have little to do with the euro. It would have to implement reforms in any case. In the Eurozone, Greece can do that with the support of its partners. But one thing must be clear: who belongs in the euro area and who does not is not for the ECB to decide. That is a matter for the Member States.</p> <p><strong>BILD: They are now more fractious than ever. Is that the biggest danger for Europe?</strong></p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> We are experiencing several crises which are all interconnected and reinforce each other. That makes it all the more important to resist every kind of nationalism or isolationism. Both are however on the rise. That worries me a lot.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff244549aa407d64160c9faaa4c0b8c8ca75a9d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff244549aa407d64160c9faaa4c0b8c8ca75a9d4/0_281_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Draghi (centre) at the end of last week\u2019s ECB press conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi (centre) at the end of last week\u2019s ECB press conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5720d938e4b0ba980af16e9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-27T15:31:14.380Z\">4.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of a visit to the German parliament, ECB president Mario Draghi has given an interview to Bild newspaper.</p> <p>Draghi has been criticised in Germany for the ECB\u2019s low interest rate policy, which has affected the country\u2019s savers, and has also been attacked by German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble.</p> <p>In the interview - <strong><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/draghi-germany-is-fundamentally-wrong-when-its-comes-to-investing-2016-4?IR=T\">which has been repeated in English by Business Insider</a></strong> - he has come out fighting\u201d</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Draghi: </strong>We are well aware of the situation for savers. And it\u2019s not only in Germany that people have to face low interest rates. But interest rates are low because growth is low and inflation is too low. Think about the alternative: if we raised rates now, it would be bad for the economy and we would unleash deflation, unemployment and recession. The interest on savings comes from growth, so the interest of savers is that inflation stabilises and growth becomes more robust. Besides, many savers benefit from low interest rates as they are also homebuyers, taxpayers, entrepreneurs and workers whose companies are benefiting.</p> <p><strong>BILD: In Germany the adverse effects are predominant. Making provision for retirement is becoming increasingly difficult\u2026</strong></p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> Remember, what counts is what you earn on savings in real terms, i.e. interest minus inflation. This is higher today than it was in the 1990s. At that time you might have had a higher interest rate on your Sparbuch, but we often had an inflation rate that was higher still. So you could buy less with the money you received. Moreover, people can influence how much they get on their savings even in times of low interest rates. They don\u2019t just have to keep the money in savings accounts but can invest in other ways. The Bundesbank has recently shown that the average return on all German household assets is close to 2%.</p> <p><strong>BILD: So, are the German savers themselves to blame?</strong></p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> No. But there are alternatives in investing savings. In the United States savers had to face seven years of zero interest rates. Banks, insurers, the financial system nevertheless still worked. Money was invested in a variety of ways which in the end enabled a decent return.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said he did not take the criticism from the likes of Sch\u00e4uble personally but added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One thing is clear: the ECB obeys the law, not the politicians. Or, as one of my predecessors put it, it is normal for politicians to comment on our actions. But it would be abnormal if we listened to them.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he defended the ECB policies, saying they were working:</p> <blockquote> <p>But we must be patient; investor confidence has not yet been fully restored. For two years, the economy in the euro area has been growing month by month, banks are lending and unemployment is steadily falling,. Meanwhile, euro area countries are now able to buy more German exports again, which, for German companies, is partly making up for the decline in trade with China. But it is a slow process because the crisis was more severe than anything we had since the Second World War.</p> </blockquote> <p>As to when interest rates would rise, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Quite simple: when the economy is growing more strongly again and inflation rises closer to our objective. Low interest rates today will lead to higher rates tomorrow.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he said the majority of governments were acting on the necessary reforms \u201calbeit too slowly for my personal taste. All of them would be well advised to do more. But that is not primarily dependent on the ECB and its policies.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-27T15:39:18.324Z\">at 4.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5720d77de4b09a82af1484ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-27T15:17:51.367Z\">4.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The US Treasury secretary undersecretary for international affairs, Nathan Sheets, has been speaking to a House financial committee, and made some comments on the situation in Greece</strong>.

Here\u2019s why:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Firstly, the consumer economy is coming off the boil</strong>. Retail sales volumes have fallen for two consecutive months on the latest ONS data. Rising inflation later this year and into 2017 will take further steam out of the household-led recovery, as will signs of a softening in the labour market with some high profile companies announcing job cuts in recent weeks.</p> <p><strong>The UK\u00b4s international trade position is also a major concern.</strong> The current account data released last month showed a record high deficit of 7% of GDP at the end of last year - now greater than the fiscal deficit. Essentially, the country\u2019s poor position on exports and overseas investments means that the UK is now borrowing a huge sum of money from the rest of the world each year.

                "bodyText":"Another rise in the oil price helped lift stock markets, even though crude came off its best levels following a bigger than expected rise in US inventories. UK GDP was in line with forecasts, while there was a positive reaction to a number of company results including Barclays and GlaxoSmithKline. Apple\u2019s disappointing figures however left technology shares flagging, and investors remained cautious ahead of the latest rate setting meetings from the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 35.39 points or 0.56% at 6319.91 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.39% to 10,299.83 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.58% to 4559.40 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.43% to 18,750.62 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.53% higher at 9332.6 In Greece, the Athens market fell 2.51% to 584.55 on renewed concerns about its bailout and new disagreements with its creditors On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 22 points or 0.13% ahead of the Fed. Meanwhile Brent crude is currently up 1.16% at $46.27 a barrel having earlier climbed as high as $47.05. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Citi has come up with forecasts for interest rates in the UK, eurozone and Japan: Here\u2019s Reuters latest story on the situation between Greece and its creditors: Greece accused the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday of undermining negotiations over the release of more bailout funds needed in the next few weeks to repay debt. At issue is what measures Athens would take if it fails to reach fiscal targets by 2018. Creditors, including the IMF and European institutions, want those measures made law immediately. Athens argues that its constitution precludes legislation on a hypothetical event but it has offered to discuss a mechanism of automatic cutbacks. Government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili told reporters that the IMF had not accepted the proposal. \u201cThe IMF is making demands which go beyond what was agreed,\u201d Gerovasili said, referring to a 86-billion-euro ($97-billion) deal struck last year and talks to unlock more than five billion euros in bailout funds needed to pay EU and IMF debts by July. \u201cThese demands undermine efforts by both the Greek government and European institutions,\u201d she said. An IMF spokesman in Washington said the institution had no immediate comment on the matter. More on Greece: The interview closes with Draghi saying it will be his pleasure to go to the Bundestag. On the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union, Draghi says: I cannot and do not wish to believe that the British would vote to leave, because we are stronger together. But if they do, it should be clear: they would lose the benefits of the single market. Draghi was also asked about Greece: BILD: Mr Draghi, in your first interview with BILD four years ago, we spoke a lot about Greece. The country has still not got back on its feet, even though it has received hundreds of billions in emergency loans. When will the madness end? Draghi: Clearly, last year was an economic setback for Greece. Now everyone is aware that there can be no growth without reforms. And what the country and its citizen need above all is growth. Greece has implemented many reforms in the past months and is committed to the path of reforms. BILD: Is the euro a part of the solution for Greece, or a part of the problem? Draghi: Greece\u2019s challenges have little to do with the euro. It would have to implement reforms in any case. In the Eurozone, Greece can do that with the support of its partners. But one thing must be clear: who belongs in the euro area and who does not is not for the ECB to decide. That is a matter for the Member States. BILD: They are now more fractious than ever. Is that the biggest danger for Europe? Draghi: We are experiencing several crises which are all interconnected and reinforce each other. That makes it all the more important to resist every kind of nationalism or isolationism. Both are however on the rise. That worries me a lot. Ahead of a visit to the German parliament, ECB president Mario Draghi has given an interview to Bild newspaper. Draghi has been criticised in Germany for the ECB\u2019s low interest rate policy, which has affected the country\u2019s savers, and has also been attacked by German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. In the interview - which has been repeated in English by Business Insider - he has come out fighting\u201d Draghi: We are well aware of the situation for savers. And it\u2019s not only in Germany that people have to face low interest rates. But interest rates are low because growth is low and inflation is too low. Think about the alternative: if we raised rates now, it would be bad for the economy and we would unleash deflation, unemployment and recession. The interest on savings comes from growth, so the interest of savers is that inflation stabilises and growth becomes more robust. Besides, many savers benefit from low interest rates as they are also homebuyers, taxpayers, entrepreneurs and workers whose companies are benefiting. BILD: In Germany the adverse effects are predominant. Making provision for retirement is becoming increasingly difficult\u2026 Draghi: Remember, what counts is what you earn on savings in real terms, i.e. interest minus inflation. This is higher today than it was in the 1990s. At that time you might have had a higher interest rate on your Sparbuch, but we often had an inflation rate that was higher still. So you could buy less with the money you received. Moreover, people can influence how much they get on their savings even in times of low interest rates. They don\u2019t just have to keep the money in savings accounts but can invest in other ways. The Bundesbank has recently shown that the average return on all German household assets is close to 2%. BILD: So, are the German savers themselves to blame? Draghi: No. But there are alternatives in investing savings. In the United States savers had to face seven years of zero interest rates. Banks, insurers, the financial system nevertheless still worked. Money was invested in a variety of ways which in the end enabled a decent return. He also said he did not take the criticism from the likes of Sch\u00e4uble personally but added: One thing is clear: the ECB obeys the law, not the politicians. Or, as one of my predecessors put it, it is normal for politicians to comment on our actions. But it would be abnormal if we listened to them. And he defended the ECB policies, saying they were working: But we must be patient; investor confidence has not yet been fully restored. For two years, the economy in the euro area has been growing month by month, banks are lending and unemployment is steadily falling,. Meanwhile, euro area countries are now able to buy more German exports again, which, for German companies, is partly making up for the decline in trade with China. But it is a slow process because the crisis was more severe than anything we had since the Second World War. As to when interest rates would rise, he said: Quite simple: when the economy is growing more strongly again and inflation rises closer to our objective. Low interest rates today will lead to higher rates tomorrow. And he said the majority of governments were acting on the necessary reforms \u201calbeit too slowly for my personal taste. All of them would be well advised to do more. But that is not primarily dependent on the ECB and its policies.\u201d The US Treasury secretary undersecretary for international affairs, Nathan Sheets, has been speaking to a House financial committee, and made some comments on the situation in Greece. Reuters reports: [He] said that Greece would not have access to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s exceptional lending facilities in the next phase of its bailout, adding that the Treasury supports the IMF\u2019s insistence that the bailout be restructured to make Greece\u2019s debt sustainable with more reforms from Athens and debt relief from European lenders. David Morrison, senior market strategist at SpreadCo said: The latest crude inventories from the EIA showed a build of 2 million barrels last week... Crude fell sharply on the news. Yesterday the American Petroleum Institute reported a draw of nearly 1.1 million barrels in US inventories last week. Oil soared on the news as analysts had expected a build of 2.4 million barrels. Both WTI and Brent are trading at their best levels since November last year. The trigger for the latest leg of this rally was talk of an output freeze by OPEC and non-OPEC producers. But all hopes for a deal collapsed ten days ago in Doha amid general recriminations. Nevertheless, crude has continued to push higher as analysts predict that supply and demand will come into balance earlier than previously calculated. But it may become more difficult for crude to push on much higher from here. As $50 per barrel becomes a possibility, we should see mothballed US shale production come back on line. On top of that producers will sell forward contracts to lock in prices. US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week, up by 2m barrels to 540.6m barrels. Analysts had expected an increase of around 1.75m barrels, and the US Energy Information Administration said: \u201cUS crude oil inventories are at historically high levels for this time of year.\u201d The rise in crude stocks - a sign of slowing demand - has seen the oil price come off its best levels. Brent, which was up 2% before the data - is now 0.85% higher at $46.13. More data for the US Federal Reserve to contemplate as they meet to discuss their latest views on interest rates and the economy. Home sales rose by more than expected in March, according to the National Association of Realtors. Its pending home sales index climbed 1.4% month on month to 110.5, the highest level since last May and better than the 0.5% increase expected. Lawrence Yun, the association\u2019s chief economist, said: Despite supply deficiencies in plenty of areas, contract activity was fairly strong in a majority of markets in March. This spring\u2019s surprisingly low mortgage rates are easing some of the affordability pressures potential buyers are experiencing and are taking away some of the sting from home prices that are still rising too fast and above wage growth. The association added: In the short-term, the healthy labor market and favorable borrowing costs should lead to sustained buyer demand and a durable pace of sales. However, Yun says the consequences from a failure to construct more single-family homes in recent years are starting to impact some top job producing markets, where endless supply shortages continue to limit choices for buyers and are driving up prices beyond what a growing share of households can comfortably afford. \u201cDemand is starting to weaken in some areas, particularly in the West, where the median home price has risen an astonishing 38 percent in the past three years,\u201d adds Yun. \u201cAs a result, pending sales in the region have now declined in four of the last five months and are lower than one year ago for the third month in a row. Closed sales in the region in March were also below last year\u2019s pace.\u201d Apple is currently the biggest faller in the Dow Jones Industrial Average: Despite European markets holding onto to their - slight - gains, Wall Street is slipping lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 20 points or 0.11% while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.22% at the open and Nasdaq 0.66%. Apple has dropped nearly 8% after it reported its first quarterly revenue fall for 13 years, Twitter is down more, falling 15.7% following its figures. And here (in Greek) is the call from Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras for a European summit. Here\u2019s the statement from European Council president Donald Tusk: Buckle up, folks, the Greek debt crisis is roaring back over the horizon. Relations between Athens and its lenders have hit their worst level since last summer, when the 3rd Greek bailout deal was finally agreed. The two side simply can\u2019t reach a deal over the various \u2018emergency measures\u2019 that would kick in if (or perhaps when) it misses the economic targets in its bailout. This is now causing a cash crunch in Greece, forcing the government to tap various state bodies for spare funds. And there\u2019s serious chatter that we could be looking at fresh elections, or even another referendum, soon. So what\u2019s happened today? So far.... Greece\u2019s prime minister has proposed a meeting of EU leaders to discuss the crisis, but with little success. European Council president Donald Tusk has argued that finance ministers need to make more progress, and hold a eurogroup meeting very soon. Greece is refusing to accept extra austerity and blaming its creditors, as Reuters explains: Greece accused the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday of undermining efforts to broker an accord over its funding options, after talks on a review to unlock fresh bailout aid stalled. Athens would be willing to discuss the introduction of a mechanism to automatically cut spending, Government Spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili said. Greece could not go beyond that, she said. One of Greece\u2019s familiar allies, Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, has offered prime minister Alexis Tsipras some support. He agrees that it\u2019s wrong to push Athens to sign up to further cuts, on top of the measure already agreed. Financial traders are concerned, dumping Greek bonds and thus driving the yield on Greek debt higher into the danger zone: The Greek stock market was hit too: Technical talks are still continuing between officials in Greece, in the hope of a breakthrough. But anyone who lived through last year\u2019s drama will understand that progress could be limited.... Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s UK slowdown: There are some interesting developments around BHS today. First up, Sky\u2019s Mark Kleinman reports that the stricken high street retailer received a demand for \u00a32.6m in unpaid VAT last week, shortly before it fell into administration. Another \u00a310m was due by 30 June, to cover the sale of its Oxford Street store, perhaps explaining the timing of its collapse. And more surprisingly, BHS\u2019s most recent owner is apparently planning to buy the company back! Former racing driver Dominic Chappell, whose reputation has been rather savaged in recent days, has told the Evening Standard that he is meeting potential backers in America right now. He\u2019s hoping to come back with a \u201creal deal\u201d to save as many jobs as possible. Good news? Probably not, given Chappell\u2019s failure to keep the company on the road. A BHS spokesman has already said the idea is \u201cpure fantasy\u201d. Care to guess the fastest growing area of the UK economy in the last 25 years? Royal Bank of Scotland have crunched the numbers, and report that management consulting and head office activities have swelled by 500% since 1990* *- A vintage year, including the Italian World Cup, the end of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s premiership, and the Stone Roses playing Spike Island. But while consultancy has been booming, manufacturing and mining has been steadily declining, they show: There\u2019s little cheer in the City today about the latest UK growth figures. The blue-chip FTSE 100 has dropped by 12 points today to 6272 points, with supermarket chain Tesco shedding 4%. Mining shares, a handy bellwether for global economic confidence, are down around 2% too. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says traders are nervous ahead of tonight\u2019s meeting of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, and may sound cautious about growth prospects [we get US GDP data tomorrow] It\u2019s politically convenient for George Osborne to blame June\u2019s EU referendum for weakness in the UK economy. But economists are warning that the problems run deeper. Scott Corfe of the Centre for Economics and Business Research says Osborne\u2019s growth forecasts are simply too optimistic. Here\u2019s why: Firstly, the consumer economy is coming off the boil. Retail sales volumes have fallen for two consecutive months on the latest ONS data. Rising inflation later this year and into 2017 will take further steam out of the household-led recovery, as will signs of a softening in the labour market with some high profile companies announcing job cuts in recent weeks. The UK\u00b4s international trade position is also a major concern. The current account data released last month showed a record high deficit of 7% of GDP at the end of last year - now greater than the fiscal deficit. Essentially, the country\u2019s poor position on exports and overseas investments means that the UK is now borrowing a huge sum of money from the rest of the world each year. Unless financial markets respond to this and sterling sharply depreciates it is hard to see this being resolved anytime soon. The introduction of the National Living Wage will also lead to job losses, he adds, while efforts to rein in the buy-to-let market may also harm consumer confidence, Corfe continues. Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, agrees that Osborne must take the blame: \u201cBrexit anxiety could certainly be behind some of the slowdown in GDP growth, but the truth is the recovery remains lacklustre. Growth has failed to return to the pre-crisis trend on a sustained basis, and the government\u2019s excessively tight fiscal policy is largely at fault. \u201cOn top of that, wage growth is anaemic and the labour market appears to be slowing down, meaning the macro outlook is as uncertain as it has been for years. More gloom: In another worrying sign, UK retail sales have fallen at the fastest rate in four years. The CBI reports that the recent cold weather hurt demand for clothes, footwear and leather good this month. Sales also fell at department stores; bad news for the high street as it reels from the collapse of BHS and Austin Reed this week. 22% of retailers interviewed by the CBI said that sales volumes were up in April compared to a year ago, whilst 36% said they were down, giving a rounded balance of -13%. That\u2019s the weakest since January 2012. CBI director of economics, Rain Newton-Smith, said: \u201cCold weather put a chill in sales of spring and summer ranges with a reported dip in retail sales in the year to April. But with the near-term outlook for household spending holding up the sector expects a modest rise in sales next month. OECD chief \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda is now warning reporters in London that the is \u201cno economic upside\u201d for the UK outside the EU. It\u2019s \u201cdelusional\u201d to claim that Brexit would give Britain a stronger trading position, Gurr\u00eda adds, warning that some firms would quit the UK. And in an alarming development, the 65-year old Gurr\u00eda has revealed his full commitment to togetherness.... The OECD has now joined the chorus of international bodies arguing against Brexit, claiming it will hit us in the pocket. My colleague Larry Elliott reports: The west\u2019s leading economics thinktank has warned that a British decision to leave the EU in this summer\u2019s referendum would cost each household \u00a32,200 by the end of a decade and continue to impose \u201ca persistent and rising shock\u201d on the UK in the following years. Adding its voice to negative assessments by the Treasury and the International Monetary Fund, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said a so-called Brexit vote on 23 June would provide a major negative shock to Britain and have ripple effects on the rest of Europe. \u201cIn some respects, Brexit would be akin to a tax on GDP, imposing a persistent and rising cost on the economy that would not be incurred if the UK remained in the EU,\u201d the OECD said. Full story: Britain\u2019s economy has hit a \u2018soft patch\u2019, warns John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC. He blames: ...heightened uncertainties about the global economy at the start of the year, which hit the export-oriented manufacturing sector and also took the wind out of the sails of the key business and financial services sector, where growth slowed from 0.7% in the final quarter of 2015 to just 0.3% in the first quarter of 2016. Brexit uncertainty isn\u2019t helping. \u201cUncertainty about the EU referendum outcome may also have had an impact from late February onwards as it became clear there would be an early vote in June. This may have led to some delay in major investment decisions, as indicated by weak construction output in the first quarter. Hawksworth hopes, though, that growth will rebound later in the year: Today\u2019s report shows that growth in the business services and finance slowed to +0.3%, from +0.7% in the last quarter of 2013. This is the main reason that total Services growth slowed from 0.8% to 0.6%, the ONS says. That backs up the theory that stock market turbulence hurt growth. It may also indicate nervousness about the EU referendum, though, as many City firms oppose Brexit. In the production sector, mining and quarrying output shrank by 2.2%, while manufacturing decreasing by 0.4% And Britain\u2019s total economy is now 7.3% higher than before the financial crisis - making it the third best-performing G7 economy. Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, questions whether Brexit is really to blame: The effects of global financial market volatility, stuttering world trade growth and challenges on the high street feel like more obvious explanations for the slowdown. Still, referendum wobbles could make themselves felt in the coming months, highlighting the continuing downside risks for the economy this year\u201d Here\u2019s Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s official response to the news that Britain\u2019s economy is slowing.... \u201cIt\u2019s good news that Britain continues to grow, but there are warnings today that the threat of leaving the EU is weighing on our economy. \u201cInvestments \u200eand building are being delayed, and another group of international experts, the OECD, confirms British families would be worse off if we leave the EU. \u201cLet\u2019s not put the strong economy we\u2019re building at risk, and vote to Remain on June 23.\u201d Reminder: the OECD report is due out at 10.30 BST, but the group has already called Brexit a \u2018bad decision\u2019 this morning. James Knightley of ING Bank fears that growth is continuing to weaken in the run-up to June\u2019s referendum. He says: We suspect that second-quarter GDP growth will be even weaker given the threat of Brexit is negatively impacting business sentiment, leading to a reduction in risks appetite regarding hiring and investment decisions. Indeed, unemployment actually rose in the three months to February while consumer confidence is also coming under pressure. City economist Alan Clarke, of Scotiabank, reckons we can\u2019t blame Brexit fears for the economic slowdown, yet.... Instead, he argues that the financial market turbulence at the start of 2016 hurt confidence. That is not to say that Brexit uncertainty won\u2019t have an impact on GDP growth \u2013 it will. However, this is likely to be visible via reduced investment and hiring and will show up in Q2 GDP. The first estimate of that will come out in late-July \u2013 a month after the actual vote. For now, 0.4% q/q isn\u2019t terrible \u2013 it could have been worse As predicted, the chancellor has claimed that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s EU membership is hurting the economy: ONS chief economist Joe Grice says: \u201cToday\u2019s figures suggest growth has slowed as compared with the pace up to the middle of last year. Services continue to underpin the economy but other sectors have shown falling output this quarter. That\u2019s a blow to hopes of rebalancing the UK economy, as manufacturing, construction and agriculture are still smaller than before the financial crisis. Britain\u2019s service sector was the only part of the economy to grow in the last quarter! Manufacturing, building and farming all contracted, leaving the UK even more reliant on the already dominant service sector. Here\u2019s the details: Services output rose by 0.6%, (corrected) industrial production shank by 0.4% Construction contracted by 0.9% Agriculture by 0.1%. Breaking: UK economic growth has slowed to 0.4% in the first three months of this year. That\u2019s a sharp slowdown, compared to the 0.6% recorded between October and December last year. More to follow.... CNBC also predicts that Brexit fears are weighing on UK growth: The UK economy is expected to post a sharp slowdown in growth in the first quarter amid concerns that a forthcoming vote on the country\u2019s membership of the European Union is scaring investors and industry. Market analysts believe that preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) estimates released on Wednesday morning will show a slowdown in the first quarter to 0.4 percent, down from 0.6 percent in the previous quarter. Some analysts, such as those from Barclays and Pantheon Macroeconomics, thought the slowdown could be more pronounced, however, to 0.3%. The anticipated slowdown has been attributed by all analysts to the \u201cincreasing EU referendum risk,\u201d as Barclays\u2019 analysts said in a note on Wednesday, and fears of a so-called \u201cBrexit\u201d should U.K. voters elect to leave the EU when a referendum is held on June 23. Shares in Barclays have jumped almost 4% to the top of the London stock market leaderboard. Although Barclays posted a 33% drop in pre-tax profits this morning, traders are encouraged that the bank has received approaches for its African business (former CEO Bob Diamond is interested, for starters) Here\u2019s what City economists are saying about this morning\u2019s growth figures, due in an hour\u2019s time. Howard Archer of IHS Global insight, predicts EU referendum fears will knock back growth to 0.3% for the first quarter (down from 0.6%) \u201cIn particular, this is expected to weigh down on business investment and employment, and it may well also limit consumers\u2019 willingness to splash out on big-ticket items. Muted global growth and recent financial market volatility will also hamper UK economic activity in the near term at least.\u201d Tony Cross of Trustnet believes City investors will take the news calmly: We\u2019ve got UK GDP data later this morning and with the Brexit effect having been seen in other Q1 metrics, this is likely to reflect badly on the headline figures but the market may well be willing to overlook any wobbles here, given the evolving sentiment. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has become the latest international body to warn Britain against leaving the EU. They are publishing a new Brexit report this morning, but OECD chief \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda has broken his own embargo and spilled the beans on the Today Programme. Gurr\u00eda declared that \u201cBrexit is a tax\u201d, effectively costing us all one month\u2019s salary by the end of the decade. In the end we come out saying \u201cWhy are we spending so much time, so much effort, so much talent, trying to find ways to compensate for a bad decision that you don\u2019t have to take. Gurr\u00eda added that Britain won\u2019t get a better deal on trade or migration if it leaves the EU - a claim Out campaigns would obviously dispute. We\u2019ll have more details at 10.30am BST. After the embargo lifts, \u00c1ngel..... If today\u2019s growth figures are bad, you can expect George Osborne to blame Brexit fears. The chancellor has already been warning that economic confidence has been hurt by the upcoming EU referendum (his party\u2019s bright idea, let\u2019s not forget). Sky News\u2019s Faisal Islam predicts that Osborne will stick to this message: Chancellor George Osborne is set to repeat his argument that the EU referendum is already weighing down the UK economy. The key measure of economic growth - the GDP figure for the first three months of this year - will be released later today. It is expected to be markedly down from the last quarter of 2015. A slowdown from the 0.6% growth registered in Q4 in 2015 has been anticipated by both the Bank of England and independent economists. GDP growth is expected to have slipped to 0.4% in Q1 of 2016..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re about to get a fresh healthcheck on the UK economy, and the results may not be too pretty. Britain\u2019s growth is expected to have slowed pretty sharply in the last three months, from 0.6% to 0.4%, or possibly even worse. Weakness in the global economy is partly to blame, such as the slowdown in China\u2019s economy. The turmoil that gripped the stock markets in January and early February may also have had an impact on confidence, spending and investment. Domestic issues are another factor; how much damage has the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s EU referendum caused? We find out at 9.30am BST. Also coming up today: Stock markets are expected to fall back this morning, with the FTSE 100 called down 18 points. Tech stocks may be under pressure, after Apple posted its first drop in sales since 2003 - sending its shares down 8% in after-hours trading. It\u2019s a big day for UK corporate results, including Barclays bank, shopping chain Home Retail Group, and estate agent Foxtons. And the eurozone debt crisis is bubbling up again. Overnight, there are reports that Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is seeking an emergency summit to discuss his bailout deal after talks between creditors over reform measures floundered. And with Spanish voters heading back to the polls in June, we could be facing another summer of European drama....",

Restricted stock awards do not come with direct performance criteria but closely align senior management incentives with shareholder interests, as their value is dependent on share price performance, with the award taking five years to fully vest. In addition, the Remuneration Committee would have had the power to claw back restricted awards if necessary. </p> <p>\u201cThe policy was designed to ensure fairness and consistency across senior management levels and followed extensive consultation with shareholders, who held a wide range of views.

Even Forbes Magazine got in on the act, saying it would be <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/07/24/sajid-javid-the-next-prime-minister-of-great-britain/#50dc0857a0cd\">a cheering rags-to-riches story if Javid got the keys to Number 10</a>.</p> <p>But his hopes of a glittering career are now tightly bound with the future of Britain\u2019s steel industry. Today\u2019s session showed us that:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/28/sajid-javid-mps-steel-crisis-japan-markets-us-gdp-greece-live?page=with:block-5721dd63e4b09a82af148641#block-5721dd63e4b09a82af148641\"><strong>1) Javid regrets that fateful trip to Australia.</strong> </a></h2> <p>He freely admitted that, with hindsight, he should have flown to Mumbai last month as Tata\u2019s board decided what to do with its UK steel plants.</p> <p>He also insists it wouldn\u2019t have done any good, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/28/sajid-javid-mps-steel-crisis-japan-markets-us-gdp-greece-live?page=with:block-5721d939e4b02c55b640131f#block-5721d939e4b02c55b640131f\">his department has been working behind the scenes since February</a>. But we\u2019ll never know if Tata might have softened the tone of its announcement, if Javid had been banging on the boardroom door promising to do whatever it took to keep the mills running. <br></p> <p>Javid failed to shake off the impression that the government was caught out by Tata\u2019s decision - suggesting it didn\u2019t actually have a full grip on the crisis.</p> <p>And if Port Talbot closes, Javid may go down in political history as the man who took his teenage daughter on a jolly to Australia as the steel industry burned. Harsh game, politics.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/28/sajid-javid-mps-steel-crisis-japan-markets-us-gdp-greece-live?page=with:block-5721e47fe4b0ba980af17021#block-5721e47fe4b0ba980af17021\">2) It\u2019s all about the pensions.</a></strong> </h2> <p>Javid agreed with Tata\u2019s Steel UK SEO Bimlendra Jha that the pension liabilities are crucial.</p> <p>Several potential buyers have already said they wouldn\u2019t take them on, so Tata and the government need to find a way of resolving the \u00a315bn scheme, and its deficit.</p> <p>Javid claims that Tata\u2019s pension scheme is not a \u2018major risk\u2019 to taxpayers.

                "bodyText":"It\u2019s been a packed day of frustrated shareholders and gloomy economic news. Before we go here\u2019s a summary of the main business stories: There have been widespread moves to oppose executive pay deals, including the majority of investors at Shire pharmaceuticals failing to support a 25% rise for its chief executive There was a big upset at the AGM of engineering group Weir with a 72% vote against a proposed remuneration policy At the Schroders AGM, shareholders registered their frustration with the elevation of former chief executive Michael Dobson to chairman. There was also a protest over pay at FTSE 100 building materials business CRH\u2019s AGM In a seemingly pre-emptive move ahead of WPP\u2019s own AGM in June, boss Sir Martin Sorrell has been out and about defending his bumper \u00a370m pay package In other company news, bailed out bank RBS has admitted further delays in offloading 300 Williams &amp; Glyn branches Business secretary Sajid Javid was quizzed by parliament\u2019s BIS committee about Britain\u2019s steel industry, where he said admitted that, with hindsight, he should have flown to Mumbai last month as Tata\u2019s board decided what to do with its UK steel plants. Tata Steel UK\u2019s CEO Bimlendra Jha, also before the BIS committee today, told MPs there would be \u201cvery bad consequences for the taxpayer\u201d if the pension liabilities of almost \u00a315bn facing the business are not dealt with. In economic news, the US suffered a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the opening quarter of this year In the UK, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has noted signs of a slowdown amid jitters around June\u2019s referendum on EU membership. Meanwhile an economists for Brexit report claimed output would be higher, the City would thrive, the trade deficit would be smaller and unemployment lower outside the EU In US company news, Shrek is coming under the same roof as Gru after after confirmation from Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal that it has lined up a $3.8bn deal to buy DreamWorks Animation After UK retailer BHS collapsed into administration on Monday Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell face being hauled in front of MPs to explain their management of the company The person who put forward Sir Philip Green for a knighthood has said he should be stripped of the honour if his handling of BHS is found to have lacked integrity Stock markets had a weak start on disappointment over the lack of fresh stimulus from the Bank of Japan And finally, as jitters return over Greece\u2019s bailout deal, reports from Brussels suggest Athens and its international lenders are almost in full agreement on a package of reforms. But a set of contingency steps requested by eurozone ministers last Friday still needs work, a top EU official tells Reuters. Phew! And now it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Following the upset at Weir\u2019s AGM, the engineering company\u2019s chairman, Charles Berry, has issued a statement (which, in a sign they are not letting earlier hopes go, contains quite a lot of \u201cwould haves\u201d). Here\u2019s an extract from the statement (with my bolding up of some key points): \u201cThe Board are pleased that shareholders have endorsed the vast majority of resolutions at today\u2019s Annual General Meeting. The Group\u2019s resolution on the Directors\u2019 Remuneration Policy did not gain sufficient support and will not now proceed. During an extensive consultation period, the Board had tried to forge a consensus between different shareholder views. \u201cThe Group\u2019s proposed policy would have offered senior management greater stability through the introduction of restricted stock awards in return for a substantial reduction in the maximum award available to the most senior Executive Director from 250% of salary to 165%. Restricted stock awards do not come with direct performance criteria but closely align senior management incentives with shareholder interests, as their value is dependent on share price performance, with the award taking five years to fully vest. In addition, the Remuneration Committee would have had the power to claw back restricted awards if necessary. \u201cThe policy was designed to ensure fairness and consistency across senior management levels and followed extensive consultation with shareholders, who held a wide range of views. During those discussions there was broad acknowledgement of the issue facing many companies, including Weir, of how to effectively recruit, retain and incentivise senior management, across multiple territories, when market conditions beyond their control remain challenging for a sustained period. \u201cIn Weir\u2019s case, these market conditions have recently included a significant fall in commodity prices as a result of oversupply in mining and oil markets and a slowdown in global economic growth. Given the volatility in end markets, the Group\u2019s Remuneration Committee has highlighted the difficulty in setting meaningful financial performance targets over the three-year period required by the current Long Term Incentive Plan.\u201d \u201cWhile acknowledging the issue faced by the Group, a majority of shareholders were clearly uncomfortable with a new approach which did not follow standard UK practice. However, as the Interim Report by the Investment Association\u2019s Executive Remuneration Working Group recently suggested, standard practice in the UK may not be sufficiently flexible and companies should be allowed \u2018to propose the remuneration structure that is in their judgement most appropriate\u2019 including consideration of the introduction of restricted stock.\u201d Some late, breaking AGM news now and the shareholder spring is in full flow with a big upset for engineering group Weir. There was a 72.4% vote against Weir\u2019s remuneration policy. The Glasgow engineer had two votes on pay, and the policy vote was also going to be subject to close scrutiny given it included a share award which was not linked to performance. Weir had argued it had used this policy for US directors and said the pay for the chief executive was down last year. Ahead of the vote, Hermes, representing pension funds, had said: \u201cWe are recommending to clients that they vote against, due to the proposed award of restricted shares which are not tied to performance targets.\u201d So it\u2019s back to the drawing board for Weir. On financial markets, London shares have managed to claw back some ground this afternoon and the FTSE 100 erased early losses to finish virtually unchanged on the day. The London bluechips index is 2.5 points higher at 6,322.40. It had earlier dropped sharply as markets around the world were dragged lower on disappointment at the Japanese central bank\u2019s decision not to come up with any fresh stimulus measures. It\u2019s a similar story of little change on the day across European stock markets with France\u2019s CAC40 index down just 0.3% and Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.1%. Spain\u2019s Ibex has fared worse, down 0.8%. Another FTSE 100 company -building materials business CRH - has also had a protest over pay, this time a binding vote over policy. Jill Treanor reports that just over 40% of shareholders voted against the new pay policy - which covers the next three years - and which increases the chief executive\u2019s pay potential by 50%. CRH, as an Irish incorporate company but listed in London, did not technically have to put its pay policy to a vote. Its remuneration report, which covers pay for 2015, had an 8% vote against. Back to AGM showdowns now and my colleague Julia Kollewe has been at the Schroders AGM today, where shareholders registered their frustration with the elevation of former chief executive Michael Dobson, who ran the investment firm for more than 14 years, to chairman. Julia reports: Nearly 15% voted against Dobson\u2019s re-election, and almost 12% voted against Lord Howard of Penrith, the senior independent director who oversaw the move. Hermes, which represents pension funds and had urged other investors to oppose Dobson\u2019s promotion, voted against both. It is a sizeable protest vote, given that the Schroders family owns 48% of the shares. Some 4% of investors voted against the firm\u2019s remuneration report. At the meeting in London, Lord Howard said the company was aware that it was breaching corporate governance guidelines by making Dobson chairman, but defended his promotion. \u201cWe thought he was such a good and such an obvious candidate,\u201d he said. One of the biggest fund managers in the City, Schroders had consulted its 10 largest investors, and \u201coverall we received considerable, a lot of support\u201d although he admitted that there were \u201csome shareholders who had concerns\u201d. Howard said the company would continue to talk to them. Royal London Asset Management voted against Schroders\u2019 pay policy and the appointment of Dobson as chair. Its corporate governance manager Ashley Hamilton Claxton said: \u201cAlthough Mr Dobson was successful in leading the company as CEO, his appointment as chairman is inappropriate and in clear violation of the corporate governance code.\u201d There have been fresh developments in the BHS story this afternoon. Following the retailer\u2019s collapse into administration on Monday, Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell face being hauled in front of MPs to explain their management of the company after an influential parliamentary committee launched an inquiry into the department store chain. Graham Ruddick reports: The Commons Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) select committee has announced it will explore the sale and acquisition of BHS, including whether the directors of Green\u2019s Arcadia and Retail Acquisitions acted as best they could to fulfil their statutory duties. BHS called in administrators on Monday, putting almost 11,000 jobs at risk. The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 last March to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell. BHS\u2019s collapse has caused controversy because it has been saddled with a \u00a3571m pension deficit despite Green collecting more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership, with Retail Acquisitions receiving payments of more than \u00a325m from BHS over the last 13 months. The full story: In US company news, Disney will have to size up to a formidable rival after confirmation from Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal that it has lined up a $3.8bn deal to buy DreamWorks Animation, maker of hits from Shrek to Kung Fu Panda. The deal will see DreamWorks Animation come under the same roof as NBCUniversal-owned Illumination Entertainment, maker of the hugely profitable Despicable Me films and spin-off Minions. The deal, a healthy premium on DreamWorks Animation\u2019s $2.3bn stock market valuation, is expected to close by the end of the year subject to clearance by competition regulators, reports Mark Sweney. Mark\u2019s full story: Back with the main economic story of the afternoon, the sharp slowdown in US GDP growth in the first quarter, as reported earlier, forms part of a worrying global trend, in the eyes of our economics editor Larry Elliott. Central bankers around the world are getting diminishing returns on their actions and all the major economies are expanding more weakly than they were in the middle of last year. The global economy is running out of steam and the conventional weapons are increasingly ineffective. This is not about blizzards shutting factories in Michigan. It goes much deeper than that,\u201d writes Larry. Here\u2019s the full comment: Sticking with UK news for a moment, Jill Treanor and Julia Kollewe have been following shareholder rebellions over pay today. They have more details on the majority of investors at Shire pharmaceuticals failing to support a 25% pay rise for its chief executive, Flemming \u00d8rnskov. The report continues: The increase in his salary to $1.7m (\u00a31.2m) means \u00d8rnskov\u2019s bonuses are also going up, a move which shareholders had been urged to protest against before the annual meeting on Thursday. The advisory pay vote squeezed through, as holders of 50.5% of the shares in the Dublin-based but London-listed FTSE 100 company voted in favour \u2013 but if deliberate abstentions were included, support for the board fell just below 50%. It builds on the defiant mood in which the AGM season started earlier this month when there were \u201cno votes\u201d at two FTSE 100 companies \u2013 BP and Smith &amp; Nephew \u2013 on the same day. Mining company Anglo American has also faced protests over pay, with more than 40% of investors voting against its remuneration report last week. Jill and Julia\u2019s full story is here: Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been in Stockport this week and talking about the EU referendum again. Growth appears to be slowing ahead of June\u2019s vote, said Carney, who has previously warned that Britain\u2019s economy could struggle to grow after a decision to quit the European Union. The referendum itself posed a significant risk to the economy, the Canadian said. He told the Stockport Express newspaper: \u201cIn the very short term the economy appears to be slowing, probably related to issues around the referendum. One of the responsibilities of the Bank of England is to manage risk and financial stability. \u201cRisks around the referendum are the biggest risks facing the UK economy, we have contingency planning to decrease the potential impacts of uncertainty.\u201d As we reported yesterday, the latest official figures showed UK economic growth slowed markedly in the first quarter of this year to 0.4% from 0.6% in the final three months of 2015. But economists are divided over how much of the slowdown could be blamed on the referendum. The full interview with Carney, including him fessing up to drinking a whole half pint of beer while on duty (gasp!) is here. In other UK news... the business select committee has launched a full inquiry into the collapse of high street chain BHS. They will investigate the sale of the business by Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 last year, what due diligence was done by the buyers, and whether the taxpayer is now on the hook for BHS\u2019s pension bill. Iain Wright MP, committee chair, says: \u201cThe collapse of BHS brings misery and uncertainty for thousands of workers and also places a potentially significant burden on the taxpayer in the form of pension liabilities. The sale and acquisition of BHS raises real questions about whether directors acted in the best long-term interests of the company and their employees. Is there too much of an incentive in the system for owners to asset-strip, take out vast sums for personal gain, and then dump and run leaving the taxpayer to pick up the tab when the company fails, rather than create value for the long-term? Back in the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland has admitted that it will probably fail to sell its Williams &amp; Glyn division by the end of next year. It has just warned that City that it will probably miss a deadline of the end of 2017 to offload more than 300 branches, due to the complexity of separating customers from the rest of RBS. The overall financial impact on RBS is now likely to be significantly greater than previously estimated, it admits. RBS shares have been hit hard, down 4.6%. This is the third year running in which US growth has been alarmingly weak in the January-March quarter. There\u2019s no chance of the US central bank raising interest rates while growth is so weak, argues Tom Floyd of Foenix Partners. According to Floyd, Americans can stop worrying that interest rates might rise in June. Despite the Fed\u2019s best efforts to leave the door open for a hike at the next meeting, today\u2019s GDP data risks blowing it firmly shut. The data, showing a rise of just 0.5% in the first quarter versus expectations of a rise of 0.7%, undermines the more hawkish Fed tone from last night and does little to justify an imminent raise. Although the Fed dropped language acknowledging global risks it is worth noting the next meeting is only 8 days before the next major global risk event, the Brexit vote. In light of the soft data and the looming referendum, a June hike is looking increasingly unlikely with Janet Yellen\u2019s attempts to convince markets to the contrary becoming largely futile. Traders will remain rightly sceptical. Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, is also concerned by the slowdown in US growth: \u201cThe US economy hasn\u2019t run aground by any means, but it is navigating more difficult domestic waters than three months ago. Growth has been weighed down by weak performances in the manufacturing and energy sectors due to the strong dollar and volatile oil prices. On top of this, consumer confidence has been knocked recently, impacting retail sales. \u201cAlthough today\u2019s results clearly indicate a slowdown in growth, it\u2019s important to remember that the US economy has still expanded. The labour market is in reasonably good shape, and global risks seem to be slightly more muted than at the start of the year. This will help support domestic momentum as the year progresses. Paul Sommerville of Sommerville Advisory Markets says an annualised growth rate of 0.5% is \u2018woeful\u2019. This is America\u2019s weakest quarterly growth rate in almost two years: And while consumer spending is up, exports and business spending have fallen - suggesting the US recovery is uneven, as well as weak. Breaking news from America: The US economy has barely grown at all in the last three months. US GDP expanded by 0.5%, on an annualised basis, according to the US commerce department. That\u2019s a quarterly growth rate of just 0.125% - a very measly outcome - and weaker than the 0.4% which Britain reported yesterday. Although consumer spending rose by 1.9%, business investment tumbled by 5.9%, suggesting corporations cut back sharply. Here\u2019s Graham Ruddick\u2019s early story about this morning\u2019s session, in which Tata Steel\u2019s UK boss warned of \u2018disaster\u2019 looming unless a deal is reached. Sajid Javid has been spoken of as a future prime minister. Even Forbes Magazine got in on the act, saying it would be a cheering rags-to-riches story if Javid got the keys to Number 10. But his hopes of a glittering career are now tightly bound with the future of Britain\u2019s steel industry. Today\u2019s session showed us that: 1) Javid regrets that fateful trip to Australia. He freely admitted that, with hindsight, he should have flown to Mumbai last month as Tata\u2019s board decided what to do with its UK steel plants. He also insists it wouldn\u2019t have done any good, as his department has been working behind the scenes since February. But we\u2019ll never know if Tata might have softened the tone of its announcement, if Javid had been banging on the boardroom door promising to do whatever it took to keep the mills running. Javid failed to shake off the impression that the government was caught out by Tata\u2019s decision - suggesting it didn\u2019t actually have a full grip on the crisis. And if Port Talbot closes, Javid may go down in political history as the man who took his teenage daughter on a jolly to Australia as the steel industry burned. Harsh game, politics. 2) It\u2019s all about the pensions. Javid agreed with Tata\u2019s Steel UK SEO Bimlendra Jha that the pension liabilities are crucial. Several potential buyers have already said they wouldn\u2019t take them on, so Tata and the government need to find a way of resolving the \u00a315bn scheme, and its deficit. Javid claims that Tata\u2019s pension scheme is not a \u2018major risk\u2019 to taxpayers. But that\u2019s not the same as saying taxpayers won\u2019t pay a penny.... And don\u2019t forget that Jha warned of economic and social disaster if the pension problem isn\u2019t dealt with... 3) The government won\u2019t own more than 25% of British steel. Javid is committed to taking a 25% stake in Tata UK, if it helps find a buyer. But that\u2019s his limit - anything more would, in his view, be counterproductive. That\u2019s a typically Thatcherite view, and means full nationalisation isn\u2019t on the cards. Q: Finally, what can you do to reassure customers and suppliers to keep working with Tata steel at this time? Sajid Javid says he has already written to all Tata\u2019s customers and suppliers, and contacted the largest ones directly. He has also asked Tata to give similar reassurances. But the biggest comfort I can give is the action that we are prepared to take, and how far we will go to get a deal. That means customers and suppliers can look at this and say \u2018this business has a long-term future\u2019. It\u2019s an ongoing process too - we need to keep reassuring people. Javid concludes the session by insisting that the government is doing everything it can, along with other partners such as the Welsh government and unions. The Community union couldn\u2019t be more helpful if it tried, he concludes. That\u2019s the end of the session. Q: If a potential buyer says it needs nine months to agree a deal, but Tata insist on a quick deal, would you step in with a bridging loan? I\u2019m not going to rule anything out, Javid replies, but the focus is to find a commercial operator quickly. A nine-month process isn\u2019t in anyone\u2019s interest. Q: You have offered to take a 25% stake in Tata UK. Is that your maximum limit? Javid says his offer of 25% co-ownership was designed to show potential buyers that he\u2019s serious about getting a deal. But the 25% figure is important - if you go over that, the government would be a significant shareholder, and too closely involved. Q: How long would you be prepared to hold this stake before looking to exit? Javid says it\u2019s too early to say. Q: Unions have told us they would favour scrapping the lesser duty rule, in favour of a new solution just for the steel sector. Is this under consideration? Javid says he still supports the lesser duty rule [this is the rule that prevents higher tariffs being imposed on Chinese steel] The lesser duty rule works, Javid insists. Its intention is to stop dumping or provide compensation. If we scrapped it, we would have spent an extra \u00a3500m on the solar industry for example [because the lesser duty rule covers a range of industries, not just steel] Q: Do you believe Tata are a responsible seller, given they didn\u2019t fully brief you about their plans for a quick sale? Yes, Javid replies, based on the conversations I\u2019d had with them. They have approached this issue responsibly. Q: Is there timeline appropriate? They are talking about finding a buyer within weeks, but this will take months. Tata are losing money every day, so they can\u2019t have unlimited time. But it is important that they do everything possible to find a responsible buyer. I have every reason to believe that when they promise to be responsible, that will be reflected in the timeline, Javid hints. MPs are questioning whether Sajid Javid is really doing enough to help the steel industry. I will do everything in my power to help, but I cannot influence the price of steel, says Javid Q: But what about tariffs? Should the EU move faster to identify problems? Speed of action is an issue, Javid replies -- that\u2019s why I called a meeting last year to look at the issue of dumping. Europe must move faster. Reminder: Javid actually blocked a measure to impose higher tariffs on Chinese steel imports.... But the business secretary is adamant that tariffs can work. Take wire rod imports - they have gone from 67,000 tonnes to zero. Q: What is your working assumption about the pension liabilities, if there is a successful sale? Javid says commercial sensitivities prevent him saying too much. But several potential buyers have said they wouldn\u2019t be interested if they had to take on Tata\u2019s pension liabilities. It\u2019s a big scheme, with 130,000 members, and it\u2019s relatively expensive. Q: So might the public purse be left \u2018holding the baby\u2019? No, Javid replies. Discussions are already underway to finding a solution. Q: You really don\u2019t think it\u2019s a risk? It\u2019s not a major risk to the public purse, no, Javid insists. Q: What top three lessons can we learn from the Scottish government\u2019s deal to save two Tata steel plants? Javid says it\u2019s hard to learn lessons - given the Scottish plans were steel mills (recycling steel) rather than a blast furnace (which makes new metal). And it only involved 300 jobs. Q: But surely we can learn lessons from Scotland\u2019s speed of response? (they brokered a deal which say Tata sell the site to Liberty House). Javid doesn\u2019t accept that Westminster have been acting too slowly. But we must help workers to keep their skills \u2018fresh\u2019, or reskill if needed. The committee aren\u2019t impressed with Javid\u2019s claims that Britain is getting better at using home-smelted steel for big government contracts. They point out that the Minister for Defence Procurement has admitted he doesn\u2019t have the full records of where it sourced its steel from (details). Javid reiterates that the situation is improving. But we can\u2019t always assume that a UK steelmaker will make the most competitive bid for a project.... Q: Why hasn\u2019t the government moved faster to change procurement rules to use more UK steel in infrastructure projects? Javid says the government needed to ensure the changes were legally watertight. Changes are being made, and they will make a difference. But he accepts that they have not made an impact yet. Javid has been accused of misleading the committee over SSI Redcar, by Labour MP Tom Blenkinsop, who represents Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland. The committee asks why Javid allowed the steel works at Redcar to close last autumn. Q: Why did you rejecting an offer from one company to keep the coke ovens open, and \u201cshut the door rapidly\u201d on negotiations? Javid insists that the Redcar plant didn\u2019t have a viable future, and no serious offers. So given the uncertainty facing workers, he wanted to quickly arrange a package to help them retrain and find new jobs. Committee chairman Iain Wright isn\u2019t impressed, telling the secretary of state that he should have allowed Redcar to be mothballed. Instead, Javid allowed the \u201cabsolute tragedy\u201d of a hard closure. We\u2019ve lost those skills from the steel industry for ever..... And an absolute disgrace that it was allowed to happened on your watch. Q: Anna Soubry says she heard about Tata\u2019s plans via Twitter. You were on the other side of the world - how can you claim you were in control? Javid reiterates that commercial sensitivity stopped the government from saying more. Q: The government has given some very mixed messages - first saying that nationalisation was off the table, but now offering to do whatever it takes. Do you accept you have been on the back foot throughout this crisis? Javid denies this, claiming the government\u2019s message has been consistent despite the pressure not to release commercially sensitive decisions. He points out that minister Anna Soubry didn\u2019t rule out nationalisation, but then adds: Rarely is nationalisation a solution - the best companies are in private hands. Q: You\u2019re doing it again - \u2018rarely\u2019 is not a decisive word. It doesn\u2019t suggest a clear-cut plan to what\u2019s been unfolding. Javid repeats that he is under control. It has taken time for Tata to release info about its own plans, and the government has been reacting and adding its own detail. Javid\u2019s decision to fly to Australia last month, not Mumbai, is particularly sensitive as he also took his teenage daughter along. Q: Businesses complain about the lack of a level playing field, so what can be done to help firms compete with German firms? Javid says that more needs to be done on energy costs -- an issue which Tata UK raised earlier in this session. Some early reaction to Javid\u2019s testimony: Q: If you could turn the clock back a month, would you have attended that meeting in Mumbai rather than going to Australia? Of course, says Sajid Jabid. With the benefit of hindsight, knowing what Tata would say and how it would be reported. But the reality is that he must travel as part of his role as business secretary. Key point: Javid admits he should have attended crunch board meeting in Mumbai. Q: Isn\u2019t the truth that you were blindsided by Tata, which is why you set off to Australia leaving no-one in London who could deal with this crisis? No, Javid insists. Tata is a large global business, so people in every management layer don\u2019t always have all the information about what\u2019s happening. He denies that a better early warning system would have helped. Q: It looked like you were on the back foot after the Mumbai meeting, in panic mode and scrambling around to get the initiative. Javid denied that he should have flown to Mumbai for the board meeting - that would have been far too late. It might have made a great photo opportunity, but it wouldn\u2019t have helped. Instead, our work in the weeks before the meeting were crucial. And the government couldn\u2019t have shared some information because it was legally sensitive - announcing it could have made the situation worse. Q: So when the Tata board met in Mumbai in late March, were you convinced that they had dropped the idea of complete closure and were looking for a buyer? Yes, says Javid. Q: So did Tata mislead you? No, says Javid. But he was surprised by the speed at which Tata was looking to sell up. Q: Frankly, secretary of state, I don\u2019t understand why you weren\u2019t in Mumbai, says Iain Wright. Javid repeats that he had been shocked to learn in February that Port Talbot could close, but he had then begun looking for a buyer. So he was startled by newspaper reports that the board decided to settle the issue \u2018within weeks\u2019 That is not what we agreed with Tata, and that\u2019s not what they are not planning to do. Javid says he went on his (infamous) trade mission to Australia knowing that he could return if needed - as he did. Sajid Javid has arrived, flanked by two senior officials. Iain Wright, BIS committee chair, goes first: Q: You told the House on 11 April that Tata were seriously considering closing Port Talbot. The CEO of Tata UK has questioned that this morning [earlier] - so who actually told you, and when? Javid says that Tata India (so not the UK branch) told him in mid-February that they were considering shutting Port Talbot and focusing on the rest of their UK operations. We then worked intensively to try to persuade Tata to keep funding their operations, and embark on a turnaround plan. But it became clear that the board might not accept that, so we began considering whether an alternative owner could be found instead - and considering what we could do to assist Q: What did you do between mid-February and the Mumbai board meeting at the end of March when the decision to sell up was taken? Javid says he asked the company if there was anything we could do that would prevent them from closing Port Talbot. And the short answer was no. There were things they wanted us to do for the rest of the business - but I kept my focus on saving Port Talbot. So we began considering whether another buyer could be found. Tata is a global producer, not just a UK one, so there may be another company who could take their operations on. Reminder, you can watch today\u2019s hearing here. We should hear from the business secretary in a moment.... That\u2019s the end of the session with Bimlendra Jha, so what did MPs learn from the Tata UK boss? 1) The pension issue is absolutely crucial. No potential buyer is going to buy Port Talbot, and Tata\u2019s other steel plants, without some solution Tata\u2019s pension fund has \u00a315bn of liabilities, and an estimated deficit of under \u00a3500m. The collapse of high street chain BHS showed that pension black holes get bigger when a firm goes under, as potential losses are \u201ccrystallised\u201d. Jha insisted that there are ways of fixing this problem, without using public money; hopefully Sajid Javid can give more details shortly. 2) Tata insists it kept the government in the loop. The \u201cwriting was on the wall all the time\u201d, Jha insists, when quizzed about exactly when it warned the government that the situation was unsustainable. That raises fresh questions about Javid\u2019s decision to fly to Australia as the crisis escalated. 3) Can Port Talbot be saved, in current climate? Jha says there are \u201cserious question marks\u201d over the South Wales plant. And he pinned the blame firmly on high costs, such as energy and business rates, that are making it unprofitable. We would not be selling up if we could make money, he insists. 4) This crisis could still end very badly. As he urged the government to address the pension issue, Jha warned that the stakes are terribly high. It\u2019s not just the four thousand or so workers at Port Talbot, but the \u201ceconomic and social consequences of that kind of disaster\u201d if steel fails. Q: What can be done to remove uncertainty and help solve this crisis? This uncertainty is exactly why we need an accelerated timescale for this sale, says Bimlendra Jha. He may still be bristling from that criticism that Tata want \u2018non-binding\u2019 letters of intent from potential buyers next week). We must remove uncertainty among customers, suppliers and staff. The government have given us letters, which we can use to reassure suppliers, he adds. Q: What happens to Tata UK\u2019s pension liabilities if Port Talbot closes or is sold? The number of contributors goes down by 4,700, Jha replies, so the burden increases and the scheme becomes weaker. Bimlendra Jha then gives MPs a lesson in running a manufacturing giant in the 21st century. UK manufacturing is in decline, and when we hurt ourselves with high energy costs or business rates you hurt the whole industry. And when a firm can easily move over the Channel and buy energy cheaper, the situation quickly worsens. We cannot be the ones who shut the door on the industrial revolution which began in this country, Jha declares, jabbing at his desk. And this chart, from retail commentator Paul Mitchell, shows how rates have gone up and up: Q: We\u2019ve heard a lot about pensions liabilities at BHS this week, but those liabilities would be dwarfed by Tata Steel\u2019s liabilities. What consideration have you taken about potential liabilities to the UK taxpayer? We need to be aware that if this pension fund liability is not taken care of, there is no buyer sitting out there to buy this business, CEO Jha replies. [Tata UK has a pension scheme of around \u00a315bn, and a deficit of around \u00a3485m] If we don\u2019t solve this problem, we are staring at some very bad consequences for the UK taxpayers, Jha continues. It\u2019s not just the Tata Steel workers, it\u2019s the entire supply chain and the entire communities that demand on it. Jha says: I don\u2019t know what arithmetic has been done on the economic and social consequences of that kind of disaster.... Key point: Tata says no buyer for its steel works unless pension fund liability is addressed Q: What about your arithmetic? You bought this business, and you knew about the liabilities at the time... We have kept it funded, Jha interjects Q: But is there a wider issue about businesses walking away from their liabilities? Tata have constantly put money into the pension fund. We have had constant dialogue with our trade union partners. Jha then says Tata has been speaking to the government about finding solutions that would not involve public money or hurt the company. He suggests that a move to a defined contribution scheme, rather than a final salary scheme, would help. Q: Do all communications between Tata and the UK government go through you, Mr Jha? No, replies Jha (who took over as CEO earlier this month) So you can\u2019t be sure that Tata didn\u2019t privately tell the government months ago that it was considering closure (as Sajid Javid told MPs this month). Jha confirms that this is true, but then warns: There are serious question marks about the viability of Port Talbot. Q: Does Tata believe the UK government is open to buying British steel for infrastructure projects? Marc Meyohas of Greybull Capital says the government is open to dialogue on this issue, and it\u2019s crucial that this dialogue delivers results. The government have made it clear they are behind the industry, he says. Q: Anything in writing? Not to us, Meyohas replies. Q: How long have you been talking intensively with the UK government? We have been talking to the government on a daily basis for months, Bimlendra Jha says. There is now also a team from Tata\u2019s in Q: When did you tell the government that the situation was so serious? Jha can\u2019t say exactly when it happened, during the ongoing dialogue over issues such as business rates. Q: When did you decide to pull out of the UK? At the board meeting of 29 March, when the board released that the losses were unsustainable. Q: But the government would have known how serious things were? The writing was on the wall all the time, Jha says. It\u2019s hard to say when the penny drops in someone\u2019s mind, though. Key point: Tata says government was aware of how serious the problems were. The commitee turn to Marc Meyohas of Greybull Capital, which is funding a management buyout of Tata\u2019s site in Scunthorpe. We are confident that the management plan to turn Scunthorpe around will work, says Meyohas. Q: Will it work better than your involvement with Comet (the UK retailer which collapsed in 2012)? We only had a small involvement in Comet, Meyohas insists. There is great sadness that we are leaving the UK, Jha concludes, but we must be responsible to our shareholders too. Q: Is the government doing enough? Tata UK CEO Bimlendra Jha says there is a growing awareness that more needs to be done, such as on energy costs. But there are serious structural weaknesses - Tata UK would not be loss-making if we had Germany\u2019s energy costs. Q: Would you be selling the business if there wasn\u2019t an uneven playing field? We wouldn\u2019t not be selling the business if it wasn\u2019t loss-making, Jha insists. Tata has put in \u00a31.5bn in capital expenditure, and written off \u00a32bn, and hasn\u2019t taken a divident from the UK operations in the last nine years. We have taken all the hit, all the time. Q: What is the timescale for a sale? There is no deaddrop time, but given the losses, urgency is important as we can\u2019t continue to bleed money. Q: Can you guarantee that you will keep the UK operations running until a buyer is found to save jobs? We cannot give any such commitment Q: So do you have an internal deadline? Jha insists that Tata is a responsible seller, however... What if no buyer emerges? We cannot continue to bleed. Iain Wright asks why Tata has asked potential buyers to submit offers by next week. Why is the timescale so short? Our world reknown advisors believe this is a liberal timescale compared to what administrators would do, says Bimlendra Jha. Iain Wright, committee chairman, begins by asking Bimlendra Jha when Tata first began considering closing its UK steel operations rather than selling it. We haven\u2019t said we are planning to close it, Jha replies. But the secretary of state told Parliament he was told privately several weeks ago that Tata was considering immediate closure, Wright says. Our board meeting only decided to exit the UK, Jha says. Wright asks if Tata intimated to the government that you might simply close the sites? No. Jha insists. There is a very difficult business case to continue with Port Talbot. Therefore, we must find a buyer who can make the whole UK strip system work - both Port Talbot, and the downstream operations. The hearing on the Steel Industry is starting now, the Grimond Room of the House of Commons. The first witnesses are Bimlendra Jha, CEO of Tata Steel UK, and Marc Meyohas, partner of Greybull Capital. You can watch it live here. A month ago, the crisis in Britain\u2019s steel industry appeared to be career-defining for Sajid Javid. Not in a good way, either. Famously, the business secretary jetted off to a trip to Australia just as Tata\u2019s board took the momentous decision to sell all its UK operations. He was then dragged back to Britain (with a non-too-impressed teenage daughter in tow), and only reached Port Talbot on April 1 three days after the story broke. Over the last month, Javid should have had his head down helping to find a buyer for Tata\u2019s UK steelworkers and save around 40,000 jobs. Last week, he announced that the government would provide hundreds of millions of pounds in state support, such as loans and grants, and possibly even an equity stake. Today\u2019s steel hearing comes two days after prime minister David Cameron visited Tata\u2019s main blast furnace on the south coast of Wales: The Press Association explains: Prime Minister David Cameron visited the Tata Steel works in Port Talbot, South Wales, on Tuesday to assure workers, unions and bosses of the Government\u2019s commitment to support the future of steel-making at the under-threat plant. Unions welcomed the recent offer of state support for potential buyers, but stressed that any action must cover plants across the whole country and not just in Wales. Mr Rickhuss said the Prime Minister had \u201clooked proud steelworkers in the eye and promised to do all he could to protect their jobs\u201d, and said his union would \u201chold him at his word\u201d. European stock markets have been dragged down by disappointment that the Bank of Japan didn\u2019t unleash more stimulus today. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 40 points or 0.6%, and there are similar losses in Paris and Frankfurt. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says: London equities have been rattled in early trade with the shock news that the Bank of Japan offered no further stimulus being seen as a key factor in driving sentiment. Britain\u2019s investors have a great chance to protest against excessive boardroom pay today. No fewer than 26 companies are holding annual general meetings today, and there could be revolts against remuneration policies at several major companies including drugs firm Shire Pharmaceuticals, and engineering group Weir. My colleague Jill Treanor explains: The votes on pay at Shire Pharmaceuticals, CRH (a building materials business) and Weir are expected to be tight, especially at Shire \u2013 where chief executive Flemming \u00d8rnskov is receiving a 25% rise in his salary to $1.7m (\u00a31.2m). Investors in Japan are nursing heavy losses today after the country\u2019s central bank defied expectations of yet more stimulus measures. The main Japanese stock index, the Nikkei, has slumped by 3.6% and the yen has soared against the US dollar. All because the Bank of Japan left its (already sizeable) stimulus programme unchanged at today\u2019s policy meeting. Economists had been expecting another big move - further rate cuts and yet more electronic money-printing, to try and get Japan\u2019s growth and inflation rate up. So, bad news for plucky investors. But perhaps a victory for those who argue monetary policy shouldn\u2019t be the only tool fighting the economic malaise. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The future of Britain\u2019s steel industry is under scrutiny today, as MPs investigate efforts to save tens of thousands of jobs at Tata\u2019s operations across the UK. Business secretary Sajid Javid will be quizzed about the government\u2019s plans this morning, at 10.30am. Before that, the BIS select committee will also hear from Bimlendra Jha, chief executive of Tata and Marc Meyohas of Greybull Capital, which is buying Tata\u2019s plant at Scunthorpe. MPs are presumably going to ask how the UK steel industry reached this plight, the issue of Chinese steel dumping, and the government\u2019s offer to partly nationalise the sites. They should also probe reports that Tata might actually keep the sites, a month after shocking Britain by putting them up for sale. Here\u2019s the key timings: At 9.10am Bimlendra Jha, CEO, Tata Steel UK Marc Meyohas, Partner, Greybull Capital LLP At 9.50am Fergus Ewing MSP, Minister for Business, Energy and Tourism Edwina Hart AM, Minister for Economy, Science and Transport Tom Blenkinsop MP, Chair, All Party Parliamentary Group for the Steel and Metal Related Industry Gareth Stace, Director, UK Steel Roy Rickhuss, General Secretary of Community and Chair of the National Trade Union Steel Coordinating Committee At 10.30am The Rt Hon Sajid Javid MP, Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills Niall McKenzie, Director, Infrastructure &amp; Materials, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills Anthony Odgers, Deputy Chief Executive and Director, Corporate Finance UK Government Investments Also coming up today.... At 1.30pm, we find out how the US economy fared in the last quarter. Economists expect a sharp slowdown, to a quarterly rate of just 0.15%. That would make Britain\u2019s slowdown, to 0.4%, look quite decent - and would also fuel concerns that the global economy is weakening. In the City, Lloyds bank is reporting financial results. And the Greek bailout crisis is also rumbling on. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is due to speak to European Council President Donald Tusk today, after Tusk rejected his call on Wednesday for a leaders\u2019 summit to discuss Greece\u2019s bailout talks. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> In our opinion, the possibility that the U.K. could leave the European Union (EU) as a consequence of a planned \u201cleave or remain\u201d referendum set for June 23, 2016, represents a significant risk to the U.K. economy, in particular to its large financial services sector and exports.</p> <p>If the U.K. were to leave the EU, it may make financing its twin deficits more difficult, particularly its large current account deficit, which stood at 5.2% in 2015.</p> <p>A vote to leave would also likely lead to demands for another referendum on Scottish independence, leading to further uncertainty.</p> </blockquote> <p>It said the negative outlook reflected the possibility of at least a one in three chance of a downgrade over the next two years. It added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A vote to leave is likely to hurt confidence, investment, and GDP growth, and is likely to have a negative effect on public finances. As a consequence, a U.K. departure from the EU (or \u201cBrexit\u201d) would likely lead us to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating.</p> <p>We believe that, having left the EU (the destination for about 44% of U.K. goods and services exports), the U.K. would largely lose its capacity to influence the EU\u2019s policies for key sectors, including financial services.</p> <p>In our opinion, the loss of the U.K.\u2019s EU membership could also put at risk important external financing sources for the U.K.\u2019s large current account deficit. The U.K.\u2019s current account deficit stood at 5.2% of GDP in 2015 (the highest in several decades), down only slightly from the 2014 figure of 5.1%. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the deficit stood at an annualized 7% of GDP, the largest deficit since quarterly records began in 1955.</p> <p>In a worst-case scenario, a Brexit could also diminish sterling\u2019s role as a global reserve currency, which has been a significant support for our \u2018AAA\u2019 rating on the U.K.</p> <p>That said, our affirmation of the rating reflects our assumption that, by a small majority, the referendum will deliver a vote to remain in the EU, as well as our opinion that the U.K. benefits from its large, diversified, and open economy, exhibits high labor- and product-market flexibility, and enjoys credible monetary policy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-29T16:16:17.582Z\">at 5.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57237de2e4b02046f02ec0d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-29T15:30:10.341Z\">4.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Commodity stocks have been some of the main gainers in the past month.

The retreat from the 2015 peaks was evident across a wide range of expectations about prospects for the national economy.</p> <p>The size of the decline, while troublesome, is still far short of indicating an impending recession. The decline is all the more remarkable given that consumers\u2019 assessments of current economic conditions, including their personal finance, have remained largely unchanged at very positive levels during the past year. This divergence may reflect the strength of the consumer relative to the business sectors, and may have been exacerbated by growing uncertainty about the economic policies advocated by various presidential candidates.

                "bodyText":"The breakdown of the rig figures shows oil rigs falling by 11, gas rigs by 1 and miscellaneous rigs rising by 1 to give the total decline of 11 for the week. The total is the lowest since November 2009, as oil companies continue to be cautious despite the revival in crude in recent days, with Brent around its highest levels for the year. The Baker Hughes figures showed: Brent is currently 0.46% lower at $47.92 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. The number of US oil rigs drilling has dropped for the sixth week in a row. According to data from Baker Hughes, the number of rigs dropped by 11 to 420. The strength of the yen after the Bank of Japan decided on Thursday to delay any further stimulus measures has helped push stock markets sharply lower on the last trading day of the month. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 1.27% or 80.51 points to 6241.89 Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 2.73% to 10,038.97 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.82% lower at 4428.96 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 1.98% at 18,600.56 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.62% lower at 9025.7 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 583.65 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 122 points or 0.69% lower. Standard and Poor\u2019s has kept its UK credit rating at AAA, but with a negative outlook due to the risks of Britain leaving the European Union in what it expects to be a close referendum vote. It said: In our opinion, the possibility that the U.K. could leave the European Union (EU) as a consequence of a planned \u201cleave or remain\u201d referendum set for June 23, 2016, represents a significant risk to the U.K. economy, in particular to its large financial services sector and exports. If the U.K. were to leave the EU, it may make financing its twin deficits more difficult, particularly its large current account deficit, which stood at 5.2% in 2015. A vote to leave would also likely lead to demands for another referendum on Scottish independence, leading to further uncertainty. It said the negative outlook reflected the possibility of at least a one in three chance of a downgrade over the next two years. It added: A vote to leave is likely to hurt confidence, investment, and GDP growth, and is likely to have a negative effect on public finances. As a consequence, a U.K. departure from the EU (or \u201cBrexit\u201d) would likely lead us to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating. We believe that, having left the EU (the destination for about 44% of U.K. goods and services exports), the U.K. would largely lose its capacity to influence the EU\u2019s policies for key sectors, including financial services. In our opinion, the loss of the U.K.\u2019s EU membership could also put at risk important external financing sources for the U.K.\u2019s large current account deficit. The U.K.\u2019s current account deficit stood at 5.2% of GDP in 2015 (the highest in several decades), down only slightly from the 2014 figure of 5.1%. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the deficit stood at an annualized 7% of GDP, the largest deficit since quarterly records began in 1955. In a worst-case scenario, a Brexit could also diminish sterling\u2019s role as a global reserve currency, which has been a significant support for our \u2018AAA\u2019 rating on the U.K. That said, our affirmation of the rating reflects our assumption that, by a small majority, the referendum will deliver a vote to remain in the EU, as well as our opinion that the U.K. benefits from its large, diversified, and open economy, exhibits high labor- and product-market flexibility, and enjoys credible monetary policy. Commodity stocks have been some of the main gainers in the past month. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: Recapping the month, it\u2019s been the miners that have shone as commodity prices appear to be moving away from the dark days seen at the start of the year and some stability is returning to the market. Anglo American is up 40% on the month, whilst a number of the sector peers have added 15%-20% too. The index may be comprehensively off the highs we touched just 10 days ago, but without the boost from commodity stocks, the picture for April would have looked a whole lot bleaker. A June rise in US interest rates looks a little unlikely, and not just because of the uncertain US economic data: Oil prices have flattened out, with Brent crude now up just 0.1% at $48.2 a barrel. But they are still on track for their biggest monthly gain in seven years, helped by a weaker dollar and signs of a dip in US production. The increase also came despite Opec\u2019s inability to agree a cap on output at January\u2019s levels to tackle the current supply glut. And here\u2019s a chart of the consumer sentiment index: The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Consumer sentiment continued its slow decline in late April due to weakening expectations for future growth, although their views of current economic conditions remained positive. All of the April decline was in the Expectations component, which fell by 4.8% from one month ago and by 12.6% from a year ago and by 14.7% from its January 2015 peak. The retreat from the 2015 peaks was evident across a wide range of expectations about prospects for the national economy. The size of the decline, while troublesome, is still far short of indicating an impending recession. The decline is all the more remarkable given that consumers\u2019 assessments of current economic conditions, including their personal finance, have remained largely unchanged at very positive levels during the past year. This divergence may reflect the strength of the consumer relative to the business sectors, and may have been exacerbated by growing uncertainty about the economic policies advocated by various presidential candidates. Overall, the data indicate that inflation-adjusted personal consumption expenditures will grow by 2.5% in 2016. US consumer confidence is at its weakest since September last year, according to a new survey. The University of Michigan consumers sentiment index has fallen from 91 in March to 89 in April, below estimates of a level of 90. More downbeat US data. The Chicago purchasing management index has come in at 50.4 in April, compared to 53.6 in the previous month and expectations of a level of 53. Philip Uglow, chief economist of compilers MNI Indicators, said: This was a disappointing start to the second quarter, with the Barometer barely above the neutral 50 mark in April. Against a backdrop of softer domestic demand and the slowdown abroad, panellists are now more worried about the impact a rate hike might have on business than they were at the same time last year. US markets have followed other global bourses lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 46 points or 0.2% in early trading. Markets remain nervous as the yen hits an 18 month high, on concerns that the Bank of Japan may hold fire on any further stimulus measures after disappointing investors at this week\u2019s meeting. With mixed performances so far from the latest company reporting season - Apple being a notable casualty - markets are looking fairly fragile again. The FTSE 100 is down 0.9% while German and French markets are both down around 2%. Stronger than expected eurozone growth figures have done little for equities, but helped push the euro higher. Opec\u2019s oil output in April rose by 170,000 barrels month on month to 32.64m barrels, according to a Reuters survey. The rise, bringing the level close to January\u2019s record high, was led by Iran, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. There were declines reported by Kuwait following a strike, Nigeria and Venezuela with Saudi Arabian output little changed from March. Opec and other producers have so far failed to agree proposals to cap output at January\u2019s levels in an effort to combat the current supply glut. Brent crude is currently up 0.4% at $48.34 a barrel, not far off the $50 a barrel level which a number of companies including BP believe will bring back some stability to the sector. Traders across Europe have given a resounding shrug to the eurozone\u2019s growth figures. All the main stock markets are down today, with the FTSE 100 shedding 56 points (0.8%). The French and German markets are both deeper in the red, losing around 1.5%. Royal Bank of Scotland are the biggest faller, down almost 5% now, after reporting a fresh heavy loss. And the tech sector is looking jittery, after billionaire investor Carl Icann revealed he had ditched his stake in Apple. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: For tech shares, April has indeed been \u2018the cruellest month\u2019, and while the sector as a whole is still up since the February lows, it looks like any further market rally for US shares may well have to contend without support from these high-growth names. Swiss bank UBS has upgraded its forecast for eurozone growth this year. It now expects the region to expand by 1.6% in 2016, up from 1.4%, following the news that growth has doubled to 0.6%. Reinhard Cluse, UBS economist explains: While temporary factors, including weather, may partly explain this outcome, today\u2019s reading nevertheless comes as a rather positive surprise when considering the difficult external environment at the beginning of the year. Today\u2019s GDP report contains less detail than usual, as Eurostat have produced it within 30 days of the quarter\u2019s end, not the usual 45 days. Tomas Holinka, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, reckons the growth rate could prove to be too optimistic, once more data comes in: \u201cThe euro zone economy was at a better shape at the beginning of this year than expected. The quarterly growth accelerated to 0.6% in the three months to March, from 0.3% in the previous quarter. Although this preliminary number might be revised down in coming months, the growth definitely surprised on the upside. Yet weakening U.S. and emerging market economies, the influx of migrants, and a possible U.K. exit from the EU are key risks to the region\u2019s economy.\u201d Bert Colijn, economist at ING, says he\u2019s \u201castonished\u201d that eurozone growth has doubled to 0.6%: The first months of the year were tumultuous with large stock market declines, growth concerns in the US, China and many emerging markets and plummeting confidence among businesses and consumers. Clearly, businesses and consumers have not acted on their gut feelings. While the US and UK are suffering from a strong dollar and a possible Brexit, the Eurozone saw a marked acceleration. This jump in eurozone growth comes at a good time, given worries over Brexit, political uncertainty in Spain, and the renewed tensions in Greece. But Alasdair Cavalla of the Centre for Economics and Business Research urges caution: This is the fastest rate of output growth since Q1 2015 for the Eurozone and its timing is propitious given the numerous sources of anxiety for the continent. However, false dawns have been common since the financial crisis and nowhere more so than in Europe. Country-level figures revealed the French economy is finally getting into gear, showing a 0.5% rise. It\u2019s taken the eurozone a long, long time to reach its pre-crisis levels again. As this chart shows, its post-Lehman recovery was knocked off course in 2011 by the debt crisis: Despite this stronger growth, the eurozone has fallen back into negative inflation. Prices across the single currency bloc fell by 0.2% this month, Eurostat reports, having been flat in March. It\u2019s mainly due to cheap oil, with energy prices falling 8.6% compared with April 2015. Service sector prices have risen by 1%, while food, alcohol &amp; tobacco costs 0.8% more and industrial goods prices are up 0.5%. In another boost, unemployment across the euro area has hit a new four and a half-year low. The eurozone unemployment rate dropped to 10.2% in March, down from 10.4% in February, and the lowest recorded since August 2011. Unemploment across the wider EU dropped to 8.8%, a near seven-year low. Here\u2019s some detail: Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates in March 2016 were recorded in the Czech Republic (4.1%) and Germany (4.2%). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (24.4% in January 2016) and Spain (20.4%). Unemployment has fallen in 25 European countries in the last year, but rose in Finland and Austria. This suggests that the European recovery is finally gaining traction. However, there is a lot of catching up to do - in America, the jobless rate is 5% The eurozone has finally recovered all the economic output lost when the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the biggest financial crisis in generations. But it\u2019s been a bumpy ride, and Spain and Italy have yet to reach this milestone: This is the strongest eurozone growth rate in a year. The wider EU expanded by 0.5% during the last quarter. The eurozone grew by 0.6% in the first three months of 2016. That\u2019s twice as strong as in the previous three months, and much stronger than expect. Better-than-expected growth in France and Spain helped the eurozone to beat forecasts, and grow faster than the UK (which expanded by 0.4% last quarter). Advertising giant WPP has thrown more fuel on the fire of excessive pay, by handing its boss, Sir Martin Sorrell, a pay packet of almost \u00a371m. Over \u00a362m of the remuneration package comes from WPP\u2019s long-term incentive plan, but Sorrell is also getting \u00a37.6m in base salary, short-term bonuses and other rewards. Sorrell has built WPP into a global titan over several decades, so deserves a lot of credit for the company\u2019s success. But still, expect some criticism - this is the second biggest payday for a UK boss ever. More encouraging news: Italy\u2019s unemployment rate has hit its lowest rate in over three years. Figures just released show that the Italian jobless rate dipped to 11.4% in March, from 11.6% percent in February. Philippe Waechter, chief economist at Natixis Asset Management, also believes the rise in French growth will help Francois Hollande: Waechter says (via the FT): \u201cThere is a stronger situation in the labour market and that will create strong momentum this year... It\u2019s perfect timing for Hollande.\u201d The acceleration in French growth to 0.5% is good news for Francois Hollande, the embattled president. And finance minister Michel Sapin has declared that the government\u2019s economic plans are paying off. saying: \u201cThis is solid growth. Output is increasing and translating into more jobs and a drop in unemployment.\u201d On Wednesday, France posted its biggest fall in unemployment in 15 years, after hitting a string of record highs. Shares in airlines group IAG have dropped by over 4% this morning after it warned that March\u2019s Brussels terror attacks have hit sales. IAG, which owns British Airways, is cutting back its growth plans after seeing weaker demand from high-margin business-travellers. The eurozone may have grown faster than expected in the last quarter. Economists had forecast growth of 0.4%. But with France and Spain both beating expectations (and Germany not reporting GDP yet), we might get a higher number in 90 minutes time.... Spain has racked up another quarter of strong economic growth, despite the political turmoil that has gripped the country this year. Spanish GDP rose by 0.8% in the first quarter of 2016, matching the previous three months. Its economy has now been growing for almost three years: That\u2019s slightly faster than the 0.7% which economists had expected, suggesting that Spain shrugged off the deadlock since last December\u2019s inconclusive election. Breaking: Austria\u2019s economy grew by 0.4% in the first three months of this year. That beats the 0.3% growth reported in the October-December quarter, and is the best result in more than two years. Reuters has more details: Exports rose 0.8%, up from 0.7% in Q4 2015 Imports increased 0.9%, down from 1.1% quarter. Gross investment rose 1.0%, household consumption grew 0.2% state consumption was up 0.3%. The oil price has just hit its highest level of the year. Brent crude is now trading at $48.30 per barrel, up 0.3% this morning. Three months ago, it was changing hands at just $28 per barrel, dragged down by oversupply fears and the weakening global economy. European stock markets are expected to fall this morning, despite France\u2019s better-than-expected growth figures. Investors are jittery following a late selloff on Wall Street last night (the Dow Jones fell 1%). There have been fresh losses in Asia overnight too. Disappointingly, Germany isn\u2019t reporting its growth figures this morning. Instead, it has just released some alarmingly weak consumer spending figures. Retail sales slumped by 1.1% in March, compared to February, which is the biggest monthly fall in 18 months. Economists had expected growth of 0.4% It could be a sign that Germany\u2019s domestic economy is weakening, adding to concerns that its exporters will suffer from the global slowdown. More reaction to France\u2019s growth figures: This chart confirms that domestic spending (in red) drove the French economy forwards in the last quarter: GFCF (gross fixed capital formation) - a measure of business investment, also rose. Trade had a negative impact on growth, though; imports rose by 0.5% while exports fell by 0.2%. Fred Ducrozet of private Swiss-bank Pictet agrees that the French growth figures are encouraging: France\u2019s strong performance means the eurozone may economy finally have recovered all the damage caused in the financial crisis. The French economy has smashed expectations, by growing by 0.5% in the last quarter. That\u2019s the best quarterly growth rate in a year, up from just 0.3% in October-December. It suggests France is recovering from the trauma of November\u2019s terrorist attacks. INSEE, the French stats body, reports that French household spending is \u201crecovering strongly\u201d, rising to 1.2% from -0.1% three months ago. Capital expenditure rose to 0.9%, from 0.7%, suggesting companies are a little more confident. In short, a good start to Eurozone GDP day.... Reaction to follow... Good morning. We\u2019re about to get a major healthcheck on the European economy. For starters, it\u2019s Eurozone GDP day, when a swathe of European countries report their growth figures for the last quarter. Economists predict that the single currency region may have expanded by 0.4% in January to March, up from 0.3% in the previous quarter. That would match Britain\u2019s performance, and comfortably beat the US (which expanded by a mere 0.13% in the last quarter). But it still wouldn\u2019t be fast enough to create the millions of extra jobs Europe needs. On top of that, we\u2019re also getting new inflation and unemployment figures, so it\u2019s going to be busy..... Here\u2019s how the morning might unfold (all times provisional) France GDP: 6.30am BST / 7.30am CEST Spain GDP: 8am BST / 10am CEST Austria GDP: 8am BST / 10am CEST The eurozone GDP: 10am BST / 11am CEST Eurozone inflation for April: 10am BST / 11am CEST Eurozone unemployment for March: 10am BST / 11am CEST",
