                "body":"<p>Last week, the Guardian published a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/13/how-boots-went-rogue\">long read about the pharmacy chain Boots</a>, detailing allegations from staff of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/boots-staff-under-pressure-to-milk-the-nhs-says-pharmacists-union\">how the business pressures its chemists to milk the NHS for cash</a>, compels them to sacrifice professional ethics for demanding business targets and to work in conditions that they believe pose a threat to patients. </p> <p>The sharpest change, in the eyes of Boots\u2019 own staff, began in 2007, when the company was bought by private equity firm KKR and billionaire Monaco tax exile Stefano Pessina. In our report, employees and experts alleged that the new owners had changed, almost beyond recognition, both the priorities and the culture of what had once been a family run, Methodist firm. Boots denied all the allegations, saying: \u201cOffering care for our colleagues, customers and the communities which we serve \u2026 is an integral part of our strategy.\u201d</p> <p>Boots is a British institution, the country\u2019s biggest pharmacy \u2013 and here were its own staff charging it with sucking money from the public purse, endangering patients and harming employees. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/17/boots-regulator-investigation-general-pharmaceutical-council-nhs\">Boots could face regulator's investigation after Guardian report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within hours of publication, the Guardian was flooded with emails, many from pharmacists. The letters editor believes this may be the largest haul of mail he has ever received about a single article. Others rang in. </p> <p>Some may have been invited to write in by their trade union but the letters are not pro forma \u2013 they\u2019re from Boots, non-Boots and ex-Boots pharmacists, and they give their individual experience and opinions. Some stress the point made in the piece that smaller rival pharmacists are now adopting some of the same practices.</p> <p>Among this unprecedented slew of mail, none accuse the piece of exaggeration. Indeed the opposite. </p> <p>The fear of reprisals runs deep and wide. The overwhelming majority of correspondents wanted their details withheld: \u201cPlease I would like to stay anonymous as I can\u2019t afford to risk a jobloss [sic] as I have a family to feed.\u201d One long-serving Boots pharmacist wrote: \u201cI shared your article on Facebook and was telephoned immediately by my manager and told to delete it.\u201d </p> <p>The letters are an extraordinary firsthand testimony from a profession under acute pressure. </p> <p>Here, we publish extracts from just a few of them. These are the voices never heard, from people rarely seen \u2013 literally, the backroom staff of medicine. Respecting the writers\u2019 wish for anonymity, we are keeping their details private. But they are sounding the alarm on what they see as a crisis at Boots, and in healthcare. </p> <h2><strong>Patients put in danger</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 \u201cI think that Boots has now reached a state where things are becoming dangerous. I often worry that I have missed something and there will be a dispensing error, sometimes it stops me from sleeping.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/boots-staff-under-pressure-to-milk-the-nhs-says-pharmacists-union\">Boots staff under pressure to milk the NHS for cash, says pharmacists' union</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u2022 \u201cLast year alone, my manager specifically asked me to work in a very busy store all week on my own ... She made it clear that she had discussed this with the area manager and that was the right decision. When I challenged her on the potential risk it was to patient safety and my own personal health. She replied I \u2018always use patient safety as an excuse to get out of jobs\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cPatient safety is severely compromised as pharmacists are asked to clinically check prescriptions while ensuring people are being served at the tills, taking phone calls, giving advice to patients, handing out prescriptions, re-ordering medication for patients, texting patients, storing prescriptions, recording clinical information, etc. Self-checking, which should only be done as a \u2018last resort\u2019 is actually done on a daily basis. Having two people involved in the dispensing and checking of a prescription is a fundamental hallmark of safe dispensing, which Boots is not taking seriously. Under pressure to meet several targets \u2026 in a Boots pharmacy it is extremely difficult to counsel a patient fully on how to use their medication correctly and how to get the most out of their medication, there is simply not a time provision for this.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Milking the NHS</strong></h2> <p><em>The investigation uncovered evidence that Boots managers were directing chemists to give medicine-use reviews (MURs) to customers who didn\u2019t need them, for company profit. The NHS pays \u00a328 for each MUR, which is supposed to give patients professional advice on health, diet and how best to manage their medicines. Each pharmacy is limited to 400 per year, but many branches of Boots (and, it is alleged, other chains) take that as a target \u2013 in order to squeeze the maximum out of the public purse.</em></p> <p>\u2022 \u201cI strongly agree that MURs are being abused as a way to make money rather than their primary purpose to help patients. Pharmacists are under huge pressure to do 400 a year. Professional autonomy is being crushed.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cI no longer work in pharmacy sector but can confirm that Boots was amongst the most aggressive in pressurising its pharmacists to do a certain number of MURs per day. I recall many occasions when as a locum I would have area managers (often with no clinical/medical training) calling branches to ask how many MURs had been done and if a certain number hadn\u2019t been met why not and that it wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cWe dream MURs, we have nightmares about MURs. Trying to justify the pressure by saying we need to do this for our patients is a load of rubbish. Yes, the idea behind them is great and we should be doing them \u2013 for free when needed as our moral, ethical and professional standing demands.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cA few months ago I told my area manager we had been doing extremely well with our stop smoking service, and his response was, that\u2019s brilliant but we need to push MURs and NMS [new medicine service] as they are pure profitable services whereas with stop smoking, it is not as profitable when you take into account the products we are providing to our patients.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Pharmacists under pressure</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 \u201cWorking for Boots is making people ill. They have an anonymous survey of staff opinions and I am sure people tell them; I certainly have, but nothing ever changes. Profit appears to matter much more than health and safety of customers or duty of care toward staff. I have had many sleepless nights worrying about the safety of the patients. If you complain you are seen as a trouble maker, or inadequate, and basically told to get on with it! I have sat and cried because of the stress and worry many times.

                "bodyText":"Last week, the Guardian published a long read about the pharmacy chain Boots, detailing allegations from staff of how the business pressures its chemists to milk the NHS for cash, compels them to sacrifice professional ethics for demanding business targets and to work in conditions that they believe pose a threat to patients. The sharpest change, in the eyes of Boots\u2019 own staff, began in 2007, when the company was bought by private equity firm KKR and billionaire Monaco tax exile Stefano Pessina. In our report, employees and experts alleged that the new owners had changed, almost beyond recognition, both the priorities and the culture of what had once been a family run, Methodist firm. Boots denied all the allegations, saying: \u201cOffering care for our colleagues, customers and the communities which we serve \u2026 is an integral part of our strategy.\u201d Boots is a British institution, the country\u2019s biggest pharmacy \u2013 and here were its own staff charging it with sucking money from the public purse, endangering patients and harming employees. Within hours of publication, the Guardian was flooded with emails, many from pharmacists. The letters editor believes this may be the largest haul of mail he has ever received about a single article. Others rang in. Some may have been invited to write in by their trade union but the letters are not pro forma \u2013 they\u2019re from Boots, non-Boots and ex-Boots pharmacists, and they give their individual experience and opinions. Some stress the point made in the piece that smaller rival pharmacists are now adopting some of the same practices. Among this unprecedented slew of mail, none accuse the piece of exaggeration. Indeed the opposite. The fear of reprisals runs deep and wide. The overwhelming majority of correspondents wanted their details withheld: \u201cPlease I would like to stay anonymous as I can\u2019t afford to risk a jobloss [sic] as I have a family to feed.\u201d One long-serving Boots pharmacist wrote: \u201cI shared your article on Facebook and was telephoned immediately by my manager and told to delete it.\u201d The letters are an extraordinary firsthand testimony from a profession under acute pressure. Here, we publish extracts from just a few of them. These are the voices never heard, from people rarely seen \u2013 literally, the backroom staff of medicine. Respecting the writers\u2019 wish for anonymity, we are keeping their details private. But they are sounding the alarm on what they see as a crisis at Boots, and in healthcare. Patients put in danger \u2022 \u201cI think that Boots has now reached a state where things are becoming dangerous. I often worry that I have missed something and there will be a dispensing error, sometimes it stops me from sleeping.\u201d \u2022 \u201cLast year alone, my manager specifically asked me to work in a very busy store all week on my own ... She made it clear that she had discussed this with the area manager and that was the right decision. When I challenged her on the potential risk it was to patient safety and my own personal health. She replied I \u2018always use patient safety as an excuse to get out of jobs\u2019.\u201d \u2022 \u201cPatient safety is severely compromised as pharmacists are asked to clinically check prescriptions while ensuring people are being served at the tills, taking phone calls, giving advice to patients, handing out prescriptions, re-ordering medication for patients, texting patients, storing prescriptions, recording clinical information, etc. Self-checking, which should only be done as a \u2018last resort\u2019 is actually done on a daily basis. Having two people involved in the dispensing and checking of a prescription is a fundamental hallmark of safe dispensing, which Boots is not taking seriously. Under pressure to meet several targets \u2026 in a Boots pharmacy it is extremely difficult to counsel a patient fully on how to use their medication correctly and how to get the most out of their medication, there is simply not a time provision for this.\u201d Milking the NHS The investigation uncovered evidence that Boots managers were directing chemists to give medicine-use reviews (MURs) to customers who didn\u2019t need them, for company profit. The NHS pays \u00a328 for each MUR, which is supposed to give patients professional advice on health, diet and how best to manage their medicines. Each pharmacy is limited to 400 per year, but many branches of Boots (and, it is alleged, other chains) take that as a target \u2013 in order to squeeze the maximum out of the public purse. \u2022 \u201cI strongly agree that MURs are being abused as a way to make money rather than their primary purpose to help patients. Pharmacists are under huge pressure to do 400 a year. Professional autonomy is being crushed.\u201d \u2022 \u201cI no longer work in pharmacy sector but can confirm that Boots was amongst the most aggressive in pressurising its pharmacists to do a certain number of MURs per day. I recall many occasions when as a locum I would have area managers (often with no clinical/medical training) calling branches to ask how many MURs had been done and if a certain number hadn\u2019t been met why not and that it wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d \u2022 \u201cWe dream MURs, we have nightmares about MURs. Trying to justify the pressure by saying we need to do this for our patients is a load of rubbish. Yes, the idea behind them is great and we should be doing them \u2013 for free when needed as our moral, ethical and professional standing demands.\u201d \u2022 \u201cA few months ago I told my area manager we had been doing extremely well with our stop smoking service, and his response was, that\u2019s brilliant but we need to push MURs and NMS [new medicine service] as they are pure profitable services whereas with stop smoking, it is not as profitable when you take into account the products we are providing to our patients.\u201d Pharmacists under pressure \u2022 \u201cWorking for Boots is making people ill. They have an anonymous survey of staff opinions and I am sure people tell them; I certainly have, but nothing ever changes. Profit appears to matter much more than health and safety of customers or duty of care toward staff. I have had many sleepless nights worrying about the safety of the patients. If you complain you are seen as a trouble maker, or inadequate, and basically told to get on with it! I have sat and cried because of the stress and worry many times.
